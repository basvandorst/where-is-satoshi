The only way you're going to get it through to them is have them download a wallet app on their phone, send them a few sats, and them make sure they know that no bank nor middleman was involved with that transaction. That no one, not even a government can stop it.

Let's say that there is no inflation, and to survive you need to buy $10 worth of food every day, day in and day out, for 100 years until you die. Let's also say Taxation totals up to something like $0.50 of your daily earnings, going to the IRS. That totals up to: 365 × $10.5 × 100 = $383,250.
If there was no inflation, then I could write you a check for $383,250 and you could theoretically eat for life with no fear of the tax man. Lunch on the first day of your life would cost the same as lunch on the last day.
With inflation, which benefits no one but those printing the money, that $383k won't last until the halfway point of your life, depending on the rate they set. They have effectively stolen all the food from you for the second half of your life, taxed away to benefit only those issuing the money.

The problem with calling it a currency now is that it fails really painfully at acting like a currency now. The scale isn't there yet and people are much more likely to be turned away for a long time if they try to use it as a currency and can't find a merchant.

There is now a major difference that didn't exist before, however.
Government-made monopolies. Most of the 1%ers made their pile by cozying up to their local government and having special laws made just for them that destroy the free market around them... Pretty much everything you've ever known as a monopoly is one for that very reason.
Bitcoin brings it's own free market to the table, one that govt laws don't have much of an effect on.
So the hardest workers HAVE NOT been earning the most, although I'm sure they earn above average.  With bitcoin, they will be earning the most, plus some of our early whales. It's a far more fair system but it'll look very different when bitcoin-centric services start to compete with the existing monopolies.

There are more reasons than all the comments below could possibly address.

One of the most important reasons is simply that Bitcoin's genesis was extremely rare and hard to produce; all altcoins are far more centralized and have a head developer. Bitcoin is far more safe because of this lucky launch.

Sounds f\*cked, but now imagine if you lived in one of the poorer half of the countries in the world. They simply wouldn't do business with you, mainly by having no banking branches in your town at all.
Those people live in an all-cash society, which doesn't sound scary at first, but it means no ATMs, no wire services, no way to buy anything on the internet, no lines of credit and no mortgage loans, among other travesties.
Why don't banks move in and serve these Billions of cut-off people? It's just not as profitable for them to do so. Not with their bloated business model. Bitcoin is what these people need too, but they just don't know it yet.

The Banks are banned from giving Exchanges banking accounts... So basically no exchanges exist there but it's out of practicality, not a ban on exchanges.

It's a really long and involved story. The short, short, short version is that Roger is the kind of person who will spend any amount of money to buy up all the things he can to manipulate people into believing what he wants them to believe. 
He truly cares about "Bitcoin" and quite tragically, he believes that he's right in thinking that bitcoin's devs have lost their way, and only a huge-block bitcoin can survive. I guess some idiot programmer like Gavin sold him on that idea and he'd rather doubt the other 500 developers of bitcoin than the one he's talked to personally. 
He's thrown uncountable millions of dollars of his own fortune as an early adopter (who started out quite rich before he went all-in on BTC) at convincing people that BCH is the 'real' bitcoin. It's no one way, but dozens and dozens of overlapping techniques he's hired a huge team of devs and newswriters to deliver.

Actually, it's not safe to assume anyone is rich in bitcoin even if they were mining in 2010... The fact is that there are many reasons one may sell long before they become a true hodler; one who plans to never sell.
I had a lot more coins before 2013 and spent most of them on a business that failed. Some people spend simply because they want to see the cash part of Bitcoin take off and they want to jumpstart payments. Many others just have a number in their head that is the price they were waiting for.

The definition of currency definitely includes an existing, built-in method of payment. Handing a dollar to someone is a way to pay them. For that matter, handing them a gold lump was already a way to pay someone even before they cast coins out of gold. Bitcoin was built to be the same, but sadly has to scale first. It's like only 10 people at any one time are able to hand other people on this planet a bitcoin, so it's an impractical medium for everyone to use for now.

Many hodlers here (10s of thousands of us) strongly feel that bitcoin is going to be the only money left standing one day. As it grows it will eat fiat currencies one by one until there are none left (hyperbitcoinization) and all economies will be based on bitcoin on that day; probably 15-30 years away from now.
If you also think there is a chance of that happening, or otherwise a chance of bitcoin existing as everyone's savings account, then the smart thing to do would to completely stop all thought of "taking profits" because those profits are in fiat, an inferior money.
  
I get that you'd like to spend some of your gains, however, and I do the same to pay my bills as I no longer earn a fiat income. So my advice to you would be to simply hodl as much as possible, spend from BTC what you can for your happy funtime rewards, and if you have to, convert a little to fiat to pay for what you need...
It's basing the latter on a need, not a reward, that will keep you spending the appropriate amount. Cheers

I don't get my news (well not on every subject) from random redditors. I used to follow ethereum, and Years ago I thought that the switch to PoS and sharding might be a good idea. They simply haven't shown any ability to deliver in all that time, and worse, full-archiving nodes are now literally impossible to bring online anymore because their blockchain has grown too big. Ethereum's demise is simply unavoidable now.
Companies like EY know accounting and law, not code. Some eth-loving coder they hired sold their boss on the ethereum blockchain, and when you look around at their huge ecosystem it does indeed look like it's the most impressive one for the kind of smart contracts that they are wanting to create.

Some clarifications by someone who has been following this matter closely for years:
1. The Petro doesn't really exist; there is no wallet to download and it's block explorer still has a tiny number of blocks created so far after many months. Sunacrip will take your money if you walk into their office and "purchase" some petro though... They give you a nice piece of paper that says you own some if you do that.
2. This tactic of Maduro's govt accepting any and all types of money in return for worthless items (like the bolivars they print) is a VERY common theme. Venezuelans joke about it like it's the country's only source of income. So accepting crypto in return for bolivars is status quo for them.
3. Use of this service will be greatly suppressed by the fact that all Venezuelans have heard the horror stories of how cops track down bitcoin miners in the country by their power usage and steal their equipment. This is what the public knows about bitcoin, and it scares the average Juan there. 
4. Maduro himself may likely be one of the world's biggest crypto miners with all that stolen equipment, but at least he's been doing a stellar job at educating the country on the workings of bitcoin. 
I don't think this news will lead to anything at all but more public education about bitcoin. Maduro may be forced out of power soon anyway, but if he manages to keep control of the country for another year or two, maybe the Bolivar will fall so far that the people can no longer use it for anything... And with no legal access to dollars, you can count on a strong following of bitcoiners to fill the gap in the economy until Maduro's ousted.

What you call modern society I call a travesty. It will be replaced with something better now that we have deflationary money. 
You can (and I almost always have) only trade stuff without using debt in your practice of capitalism. I agree it's hard to operate a business without a line of credit, but that's got a huge cost and won't be necessary much longer.
Is this another "We just haven't tried the right kind of socialism" arguments? I've got a good dozen memes for that if you're really into that sort of thing.
The bottom line on socialism is that it always fails because people cannot price things efficiently. Computer programs won't really be able to do so either because they're relying on human input, which is slow and flawed.
Only the free market can efficiently price anything and every single law and regulation ever written impacts free markets. Even the simple stuff like 'thou shalt not kill.'  They all do if you have a government enforcing these laws.

The whole point in using a SoV that doesn't depreciate so fast is that you CAN eat instead of going without eating. This isn't about choosing between... It's proactive, not retroactive.
I know things are painful down there and most of every paycheck goes directly towards food and necessities. Of course I am not advocating that Venezuelans should spend that exact money on bitcoin instead. I'm talking about any and all savings that is left over after those bills/grocery lists are paid.
Let's use an example here... Let's say you get paid $100 in bolivars for the week and maybe you make a $10 USD from your neighbors doing some small side business.
If your Groceries and bills come to $90, then of course you spend the "worst" money first. All of that $90 must be spent in bolivars, and saving the $10 USD for surprise bills would be a good idea. But that other $10 worth of Bolivars? You absolutely have to get rid of that before the price of the bolivar goes up, so what do you spend it on? $10 worth of real estate? Not possible. Jewelry? Very difficult. A Toaster or other durable goods?  They still won't preserve the value very well and it would be quite a coincidence for you to find one for the exact price as your $10 in bolivars that day... And being sold by someone who wants your bolivars.
No, clearly you have to buy either Dollars or Bitcoin with that leftover savings.
You can buy $10 worth of bitcoin on Localbitcoins with very small fees. And if you need bolivars back later, you can get that value out in bolivars later for another small fee.
Buying dollars with your bolivars isn't a bad idea, but the last I heard the rates were worse than Bitcoin's exchange rate... After Trump's sanctions the dollar's price in VEN has skyrocketed!
And then your investment doesn't even stay 'even' because the dollar is in decline. We're inflating here pretty steadily while bitcoin is deflating... So for most every reason you should be saving your value in bitcoin, although the dollar is much better than the bolivar if you can get that too.

The thing this argument overlooks is that Hodling \_IS\_ using it for something very important... A value store.
Just because you don't see money moving doesn't mean it isn't being used as a currency. Currencies absolutely do store value, and at any given time the vast majority of every currency is just sitting there, holding value (usually poorly) and not moving.
It's a very Keynesian argument to say that only currency in transit is doing any good. John Maynard Keynes was a complete retard that is responsible for more death and destruction than anyone in the future could ever figure out how to tally.
Don't be like Keynes. Be someone who appreciates money in all of it's states, resting or otherwise.

Sorry, you're not getting it at all.
It wasn't a joke. I've been to Ft.Lauderdale, I know about the lambos and mega-mansions.
What I'm getting at is that just because a car is rich or flashy doesn't mean thieves will want to rob the owner... They're looking for the easy-to-swipe portables, like cash lying about, gold coins, and yes, bitcoins.
When you have a lambo it doesn't mean you have any money in cash form at all... It often means the opposite in fact, that you're in debt up to your eyebrows.
But to display a bitcoin mural on the side of your car is crazy because it's like holding up a sign that says the owner of this car is an enthusiast of portable, hard-to-trace goods, and is more likely to have some on his person. Very different than having money in the bank. (Or not having money at all.)

"Gentlemen! I too have been a close observer of the doings of the Bank of  the United States. I have had men watching you for a long time, and am  convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the  breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits  amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me  that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter I shall  ruin ten thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is  your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families,  and that would be my sin! **You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal,** (bringing his fist down on the table) **I will rout you out!**"

Shapeshift and Lamassu BTM machines were launched there along with a ton of other bitcoin businesses.

Capitalism is simply freely trading stuff. It has nothing to do with debt. It doesn't even have anything to do with the money supply, but the way all central banks operate is to rob value away from the masses through constant inflation and give the new money to a select few oligarchs, who lend it out immediately to us at interest, keeping us in debt. 
That cycle isn't a "capitalist" one. It is the very definition of a CRONYIST system and leads directly to the oligarchy that many papers from universities like Princeton and Harvard have explicitly said that the USA is. 
However, I call central banking socialist because there is someone lording over it, keeping the masses down for their own gains while making promises of equality, just like you always see in every socialist country.

While technically correct about all the points you made, there are other forces at play you're not figuring in here that work against a govt ban. One is simply that politicians may be hodlers. Have you ever heard of a politician with an offshore bank account? Bitcoin is taking over that space after the panama papers. 
Another is the fact that the US's 'sales proposition,' what sets it apart from the other countries in this world, is financial freedom. Politicians and even most voters want to live in the freest country in the world, and most of them actually believe it is true. (Singapore is still  for financial freedom, but americans don't seem to know this.) If, on the other hand, uncle sam starts a draconian campaign against financial freedom in the form of banning crypto outright, the world's opinion of the US will be lowered immediately, making the US look more like China to investors. That doesn't just hurt the cryptofolk, but it hurts wall street as well, probably worse.
So while your points have merit and can't be dismissed, they must be taken with plenty of salt... The US doesn't want to commit financial suicide, and far more politicians are hodlers now than will publicly admit... Sunset laws ensure they can vote their conscience in secrecy so don't be so sure such an authoritarian bill will ever have a chance of passing here.

1. Bitcoin really doesn't need a 'sales pitch.' It will be the safe place to store value while the fiats are all falling hard.
2. If you talk about sats instead of whole coins, there are no leading 0's.
3. The volatility of BTC has been going down for years, will easily go beneath the USD in a few more.
4. (PITA to use): Improvements are constantly being made in UX. It's only a matter of time until grandmas can handle Lightning payments effortlessly.
5. Like cash you mean? The whole point of Bitcoin was to make it sound money, which means you and only you control it. The problems with bank-controlled money are infinite compared to this problem, which we have known how to fight against with all forms of sound money for 5000+ years now.

Never trust a bank to secure your bitcoins... That's depending on the enemy for your security.
Seeds make it even easier on them to steal from you because a seed is just information that they can copy and use while never touching the original in your safety deposit box...

It's not a web access problem, but a fiat access one. 
Technically bitcoin isn't illegal at all in India, but the central bank there has forbidden banks from doing business with any bitcoin exchange. So lots of bitcoin exchanges had to change their business model to one where they help two users trade fiat to crypto directly to each other. (They call this P2P, but it isn't.) OP should be able to use one of those, such as WazirX, which just got bought up by Binance.

I think the bottom line is that if you truly believe that bitcoin will be worth much more in the future, and you don't have a bill to pay this month that requires you cashing some out, then you simply won't want to sell it.
So learn more about it in order to believe it is still growing like most of us here do.

1. There are tons of these in stores like walmart and even gas stations up near the front counter. Names like bluebird and AMEX has it's own... You fill them at the point you buy them in the store, but some can be topped-up online, so be sure and read the label. They do all have a drawback: They don't work outside of the country, not even to buy something online where the store exists in another country. 
2. [burnerapp.com]( &amp; [tossabledigits.com]( are two I've seen, but there are tons.

Yeah, that was the default way to make altcoins for years. Every alt was a fork of bitcoin's software with a reset of the chain until Ethereum. Most new ones today are as well. It's just the lazy thing to do.
There used to be a software called CoinGen that we all passed around, circa 2014-ish that would let anyone create their own alt with slightly different features than bitcoin. It let you choose variables like total issue amount, blocktime, and hashing could be done on either SHA256 or scrypt.

It really sucks how few people in here have any idea of how Brave backstabbed the bitcoin community.
For about a year before it launched, CEO Brenden came in here often and talked with us about how to help bitcoin by using it inside his browser. We warned him right from the start that bitcoin couldn't handle his volume of micropayments yet, and that he should wait for lightning. He said he'd run an in-house system, (his own layer 2) so it would be fine;  that he could still use bitcoin and we helped him for months answering all kinds of crypto questions and I think some devs even gave him some code for the project.
Then Brave launched... It's ICO. The BAT token was going to be the native token, not bitcoin, and he obviously stopped coming around here at that point. What a douchenugget.
Thankfully, brave is open source, so GAB has forked the brave browser and  ripped all the crappy shitcoin code out of it, replacing that part with Bitcoin:  [

It's the encryption part that makes paper wallets an unsafe venture. If you want to do the encryption yourself, then sure, let them print out a nice paper for you... That isn't easy to do though.

There's tons to learn, and your reward for that learning is seeing the side of it people are feeling is 'star trek neat.'

Then once you've seen what bitcoin is at the root, you're going to need to know what money itself is. Bitcoin won't impress anyone that still has an idea of money that was given to them by modern school systems... Those are all simply misleading.

Besides the high fees, you could be looking at the wallet after Bitcoin's value has gone down in price, relative to the time you bought it.  (i.e. Bitcoin was worth $10,600 when you bought it but now it's worth $10,300, so your $40 worth would be more like $35, before fees.)

You have to convert to fiat, but that's pretty instant.  Cashapp carries a balance of both fiat and BTC inside of it, and there are no fees to go in either direction.
For example, you can be in a store and realize you need to convert just what you need while walking to the register, and in just a few swipes &amp; seconds the card is loaded ready to spend.
The best part is that you only had to convert the coins needed for that purchase. The rest stays in bitcoin without dealing with any addresses or TX fees.

That is an opinion born out of not knowing the cause behind those problems in the first place.
Case in point: If you study your 20th century history, better than they teach you in public-run schools, you'll soon see the devastating effects that printing endless, unbacked money had on warfare. Wars used to be about border disputes and trade agreements, and fighting them was always an economic choice that congresses, parliaments, kings or dictators had to decide would be in their country's best interest before waging. In the case of democracy, they basically had to get taxpayers to AGREE to fund their conflicts, and it was in everyone's best interest to end said conflict asap, wasting as few lives and resources as possible.
War was ALWAYS like that throughout history. Far more rational; far more reasonable. 
Then a horrible experiment started in 1913. They called it the Federal Reserve, and soon most every country followed suit because the people of the USA actually put up with that evil bullshit. 
Just a couple years later, WWI happened, on a scale that was never, ever imagined in human history.  The money printing presses in many countries, on both sides of the conflicts, ran at full speed day and night just to buy all those guns, bombs and tanks. Half a BILLION people died in the resulting wars and genocides since then.
If bitcoin takes away the ability for them to print endless blood money, the scale of warfare can only get much smaller. Before bitcoin came along, lots of smart folks were already calling for a stateless, seizure-resistant money to be made for this very purpose. 
It just so turns out that many problems would be solved by that same solution, and stateless, seizure-resistant money was planned/hoped for/prophecized to solve each and every one of them.

It is, of course, leaving out some of the things that can detract from that total, such as the limits imposed by the current world's money supply. We likely need $42 Trillion worth of money, but we don't need the $4.2T that a $10m valuation would call for. Not yet, anyway.
For that reason I'd say it could be decades or even a century until the need for money worldwide expands to a $10m bitcoin. (In today's $ terms) A $1m bitcoin seems in the can already, given a couple more halvings.

1. I have nothing against money laundering.

How so? The OP's story says nothing about foreign accounts at all, and where it talks about the risk of holding bitcoin, you ignore the alternative. They would have lost the business long ago, and he wouldn't have ANY stored value today.


Yes, what does that have to do with the banking system? Or did you imagine that they could stick their bolivars in a CDROM slot or something and "upload" them to foreign banks?
Only cryptocurrency allows such a thing. Try as you might you can't stop making points in Bitcoin's favor here today.


Preserving it. Taking steps so that tomorrow you can still buy as many goods with it as you can today.
You see little dips like today's -7% and think bitcoin isn't a good way to do that, but you fail to see that over time there has been so much more bullish climbing than bearish dips that even on this slow year, Bitcoin's price has risen over 300%. That sure beats the hell out of losing 99% of their buying power in just one week.

You are laughably wrong with this Roger Ver talking point. No2X proved the point without a shadow of a doubt.
If Bitcoin's only defence was hashpower, sure, then you'd be right... But Bitcoin is constantly fighting a war on many fronts. One of them is a front against social attacks, where people try to fork bitcoin away from the community and steal its name. Roger still thinks he has a chance of making his shitcoin "The Bitcoin" when "Bitcoin fails." He and many of the businesses like Coinbase, BitPay, and of course Bitmain, who together controlled the vast majority of Bitcoin's hashrate at the time, tried to gang up and fork bitcoin in 2017, and make their "Segwit2x" version of bitcoin into the only bitcoin without the consent of over 100,000 people running Bitcoin nodes.
What else could have happened? They thought nodes didn't matter, but they found out the hard way (except apparently for roger, who still doesn't believe the outcome) that you can't just declare bitcoin is some other code. Nodes run the code and only if they change the software on them, does bitcoin become something else.

\-Naive words of the day. The only thing that would work is to hide completely from governments until they have fallen. (Or joined us) 
What we're really hoping for is for some government somewhere to start buying bitcoin to suppliment its reserves with, adding to or replacing gold. Once one does, the rest should have to due to game theory. This will not only drive BTC's price to another galaxy, but legitimize it so much that laws would likely change for the better too.

Great question. Satoshi modeled and planned bitcoin's issuance schedule to mimic gold's rate of issuance, (pulling it out of the ground) except that he felt it should ultimately be capped at around 21m, which would make an ideal number of monetary units for a global money supply. (21m bitcoins = 2.1 Quadrillion satoshis. Meanwhile, all currencies together, when converted into dollars, is in the ballpark of 2 Quadrillion cents.)
The place he actually worked that out was on the early Bitcoin forum at [Bitcointalk.org]( You can read all of his forum posts there and see a genius at work.  A better place to read his writings is at the Nakamoto institute: [

They simply don't have access to foreign banking, and that's as much Trump's fault as it is Maduro's. They don't have access to much currency besides the Bolivar at all for the same reason, although a few dollars are in the country already and are growing increasingly hard to get their hands on.

Opening a foreign bank account isn't the worst problem. Moving the funds is where they get you, and in Venezuela particularly right now that is an impossible thing to do. You can't move it as Cash because it'd be too physically large.

These are tiny USB ASIC miners called Block Erupters, circa 2013-14.
There was a time, maybe half a year, when it was profitable to mine with the 330 megahashes per second that these things could add to your laptop. For comparison, a top-of-the-line Graphics card at the time did about 500 Mh/S, but sucked a ton more electricity out of your wall, and caused a lot more heat, too.

Obviously so. There are whole libraries written on this subject, the biggest being over at [Mises.org]( But just from the data given here it's really obvious why state-issued money is less valuable and less effective than any market-based money.
Please try to keep in mind that market-based money is not a new concept. Gold-backed fiat actually arose as market-based money, and Americans, for much of this country's history, were able to go to a bank and exchange their banknotes for actual gold coins. Nixon did away with the gold standard here in 1971, and we've been basing our monetary system on blind, stupid faith in worthless, unbacked paper ever since. Somehow, the rest of the world followed, and fiat money has become the norm, despite history being full of hundreds of examples in the past of people not putting up with their countries attempting to push unbacked fiat onto them. (And even more examples of economies completely destroyed by unbacked fiat hyperinflating.)

The link to your right called "Storing Bitcoins" is the long version of what you want to learn here, but a much faster, easier, &amp; direct page awaits you on bitcoin.org: [
Here are some quick definitions for you as well:
**Custodial wallet:** 
A SERVICE like coinbase or bitgo where other people you have to trust store your coins for you in a very user-friendly manner. These are great for newbies to get their first bitcoin but they're usually very expensive and sometimes go missing overnight taking every customer's coins with them. Interestingly, Blockchain.com's wallet is a hybrid custodial/hot wallet. Unlike Coinbase they actually let you keep your own keys and claim they have no access to them... Still you have to trust that they aren't lying on some level.
**Cold wallet:** 
Any way to store your coins that is not attached to the internet, even writing down a key or seed on paper.
**Hot wallet:** 
A software wallet or app on your phone or desktop, attached to the internet so hackers do have the ability to get to it... So do not store large amounts in these! They're necessary for most payments, however.
**Hardware wallets:** 
A very handy cold wallet you can buy that lets you store and send your coins without exposing your keys to the internet. These cost between $80 ad $300, but the best aren't the most expensive. Check out a [Trezor]( or [Coldcard]( first.
**A Bitcoin Node:** 
A wallet attached to the software that makes up the bitcoin network. (The [Bitcoin core client software]( It stores a whole copy of the bitcoin blockchain, and you need to keep it running all the time so most folks buy a raspberry pi or re-purpose an old laptop to run it on. That makes it a hot wallet, but it's got some powerful extra features. Plue, just by running it you help out the network.

Sadly, you are right to a degree... But only because such a large portion of the world has not even invested in Bitcoin yet.
Once the alts burn them, they stick with BTC for life. Each cycle that means the next "alt season" will be smaller than the last.
Therefore the next ATH bull run will only feature a minor alt season. Instead of BTC dominance going down to 35% or whatever it was, it'll be unlikely to dip below 50%.

Lightning atomic swaps are going to be the future of liquidity, at least for our purposes...

Sure, but which state is going to let you erode their sovereignty that much?  Non-bitcoiners in that state would likely hate our presence. 
If they don't, then they'll likely go for the idea of bitcoin in their reserves, which is an end-game win for us. The day the first country starts buying BTC to add to their reserves, all the others will have to as well, it can't be avoided.  The price would soon be in the $millions per BTC and all fiat currencies would rapidly decline, if not fully hyperinflate away.

Then you'd sound pretty foolish to anyone with the ability to tell the difference between market-based money that you can willingly use or not, and fiat money which is forced upon you and can be hyperinflated as it often is.


I feel like we're talking in circles. Cash options there include:
1. The bolivar, which is losing 99% of its value weekly. 
2. The dollar, which is so rare now that they have to pay several dollars worth of bolivars to own just one. 
Neither one of these options will allow them to cross borders with their wealth at all... Maduro's agents will confiscate them at the border. Neither one of these options will allow them to use a bank and wire their cash out of the country... US and other sanctions have made that impossible.


Ah, so you're a warhawk. There's nothing I can say to calm your psychotic, murdering tendencies, but Bitcoin does provide Venezuelans with an alternative that never existed before... If they start closing the loop of their bitcoin economy successfully, as OP tried to do but got busted, then they will not lose everything to hyperinflation and can't even be taxed on all that unreported income/savings. Eventually, if enough Venezuelans do just that, they'll starve Maduro of income completely and his regime will collapse in the same way the Roman empire and countless others did. (It would be tough, of course. Probably like being Anne Frank, always hiding your goods, services, and wealth from everyone you don't know well.)

Ok, I said heroin is legal instead of specifically saying decriminalized, but that's not a distortion; it's just too vague.

The number of grams you have on you before you go to jail in any state is never going to be a high enough limit for that ideal. 
For you to call him a "heroine hero" is fine, we should all aspire to be heroes of various types. Would you have the same contempt for someone labelled the Caffeine hero? A Beer hero? Those both kill far more people each year than Heroine ever did. Free people should be able to decide if it is worth the risk for themselves or not.
The alternative is to jail people for trying to decide for themselves, and create a dangerous black market where people die on the streets everyday in gang warfare or drug deals gone wrong. Ross likely saved hundreds of lives from that fate by moving the market online.

There have actually been many books on how assurance agencies can be made to overcome that problem too, as well those detailing how there is no reason to believe it a threat in the first place, because DROs (i.e. armies) would have to destroy their business model to behave like a warlord.

All part of the regulated banking system, and therefore Venezuelans are not allowed to use them. Anything you'd call "real money" is simply off-limits or completely broken to them. Why is this so hard for you to understand?

We were discussing supply and demand of a fungible market good. As in what makes the price of one go up and down at the exchange.
The number of things for sale is the only one that counts when trades roll in. Of course knowing the total issuance helped set the base/starting price but that isn't useful information when trading on a live market.

My strategy is super simple... Spend as few satoshis as possible until the price stabilizes. That'll be somewhere between $1m and $10m per bitcoin, likely in 9 to 17 years from now.  
That's it. There is no selling except for when it's needed. When Bitcoin is then the world's primary money, it'll be a stable unit of account, and most fiat currencies won't even exist anymore. Therefore, no currency to sell it for, only stuff to buy, like Yachts and condos on Mars.

Wow, you're actually assuming that they'll not only trust friends and family to keep keys safe, but then to do extra, regular work to check up on the safety of their keys over the years? Would you really do this? I know I'd never go through that much trouble.


I personally wouldn't worry about collusion, but there are people that would. I personally wouldn't worry about irresponsibility, but there are certainly many that would. More importantly, we should all be worried that each key given out is by definition out of our hands, &amp; so is open to any kind of threat from natural disasters, to robberies, to simply the unknown. When these things happen to you, you can plan for them. When they happen to others you have trusted, it's too much for you to ask for THEM to plan for them.

Despite what many of you think, this **\_IS\_** the same old Keynesian vs Austrian argument for a liquid/inflationary economy over personal savings. 
I know it hurts to admit it, but you have to. **Face the facts** and man up to it; OP is arguing for everyone spending over everyone saving.
As much as we all want to see the merchant economy take off and increase need for bitcoins among more people, this is a behavior that sacrifices the individual's needs in favor of the collective. Like Spock learned, the needs of the one should sometimes outweigh the good of the many.
I know this feels selfish, but it's important that you all understand; the Keynesian argument is NOT in your own best interest, and everyone who has tried Spend &amp; replace in the past can tell you that you simply won't wind up owning as many bitcoin as you could simply becoming a hardcore hodler.  That's certainly been my experience.
I do have one comforting thought for you though. Merchant adoption has always been and will for at least another couple of years be greatly hindered by Bitcoin's lack of throughput. (Transactions Per Second it can handle.) Maybe we can handle a few more merchants using bitcoin today, but until the Lightning Network is fully ready for them to do business on, the behavior OP is calling for only **endangers** BTC adoption as a whole. Merchants facing a big mempool backlog of transactions are going to Hate bitcoin and curse you for telling them to adopt it.
This obviously won't be the case anymore when lightning is ready. So please, for the sake of bitcoin's adoption and your own bottom line, **STOP TELLING PEOPLE TO SPEND AND REPLACE** **UNTIL THAT DAY AT THE VERY LEAST!**

Some rationalize that if they give up half their stash to boost the economy then it may be worth it because their remaining stash will be much larger...

I've tried three different seed storage vaults, and I think the [Simbit]( is the best. It also had some of the highest marks on Lopp's fire/crush/acid tests.


I'm really referring more to how it's effortless to open a channel to a stranger on the lightning network because you both know it's a mutually beneficial thing and the software does all the work for you... But out here in the real world, no one trusts others, not even their brothers or friends, to manually keep up with a peice of paper with a private key on it. That's a LOT of work and there's lots of risk involved. Software in the lightning node takes care of 99.5% of that work and trust.


Wait a sec, a seed storage vault works for those... Your loved ones can be told or find posthumously where the seed vault is, and if you survive amnesia you'll be wanting to go through all your belongings anyway and are sure to run across it.
Of course if you really need someone else to be a part of the system for your peace of mind, [Casa's]( been working hard on solutions to that and I can't think of more trustworthy people to be running that company.


Decoy accounts do. You can thank Julian Assange for that little trick, he came up with the [Rubberhose file system]( that gives you separate keys for separate accounts that appear as one account to wrench attackers and other violent thieves. Today we use decoy accounts in wallets like Coldcard to the same end.

Agreed. I have hope for lightning, but this is spot on.


Sure, but we all know that there is a real, hard limit of 21m coins. It's already thought of as 'the' limit by most everyone. We also lose so many coins each day, that who is to say if we're not already deflationary? It's been estimated that over 4 million coins have been lost to date! The truth is, we simply can't know the real number of accessible coins, so only the eventual 21m limit can be relied upon.
Also, don't forget that for most of that century the issuance is a tiny fraction of a bitcoin each 10 minutes.


I know the mainstream would feel this way, but those of us who have been strongly incentivized to HODL and understand now the pure power in using bitcoin as a savings account/digital gold are completely convinced. Mises, Menger, Rothbard, et. all were absolutely right about what money is and Keynes was just a lackey for governments, giving them an excuse to print at will.

The social route has been explored in depth. No one trusts anyone else enough to give them even a part of a multisig key.  -And even if some do, you can't call the solution 'ultimate' if all the introverts and people with no good friends in the world have no ability to use it.
Simply just keeping up with a key itself may be too much to ask of people as well. So far, doing so for a written-down seed phrase seems to be the best we can do.
Whatever the ultimate solution might be, it will need to be much more like those stupid default questions like "What was the name of your first pet/Favorite model of car?" -Something people already know so they're not able to forget. I could theoretically see it being a combination of them, each opening a multisig M of N keys... It still wouldn't solve every part of the problem, but it sounds like a promising start.

The philosophy behind Anarchocapitalism is called [Voluntaryism]( It simply means that no one should be forced by others to do anything at all.

Sounds made up to me. Have you seen them? Has Ross agreed that he wrote them?




If you can choose to believe the writings of dirty agents who are now convicts, then who are you to cast doubt on the writings of a guy who has been regularly writing his peaceful intentions since long before the market even existed? If you were an AnCap/Voluntaryist like he is, you'd understand his motivations far more than you seem to. For him it was making a safer place for commerce with Bitcoin first, profit second.


Ross believes that we should be free to put whatever we want in our bodies and that all trade should be free. If you don't, that's fine, but calling it criminal to run a website that allows these people to trade freely with each other is stretching the term criminal.


So neutral in intent then. I agree with you, but only for software made today. What matters is whether or not it is vulnerable to attack at any level. OpenBazaar is most likely impossible to take down by governments now, as is, of course, Bitcoin. If Ross had designed the silk road in 2015 or later, it would have looked useless next to OpenBazaar. But at the time, a centralized marketplace using TOR was the height of decentralized markets. It was like the napster, and we needed that step before we could get to a fully decentralized marketplace.

Haven't you ever wanted to use devices like this just for a short or unspecified amount of time, where you can just sit down and enjoy it for the number of seconds you happen to have spare on that occasion?
I have refrained from using a chair like that in a department store when I was tired because I didn't want to pay for 10 whole minutes, the minimum setting... Just because I didn't know when the wifey would be done elsewhere and I didn't want to waste most of the payment. This could totally solve that.

Forget about coins on the market vs coins at OTC desks for a moment. Most bitcoins aren't for sale at the moment, for any price. They're tucked away in cold wallets, hardware wallets, collections and funds. They might not be trading for 10+ years. Some are even lost completely. So the current price isn't really reflecting the price of all coins if on the open market, because most aren't there. 
Think of the 18 Million bitcoins as all the fish in the ocean, and then think of the number of bitcoins available for trade on the open market at any one given moment as the fish in a caged fish farm you can get your fish from.
When institutional traders come in, it's like they have to buy up every fish in the farm just to get enough coins for a starting position. Prices are expected to rise as they soak up the supply of available coins initially... Yes, even OTC because there are only so many fish for sale out there in that farm.
If they don't rise, they have either been adding to their position over a very long period of time, or they just aren't buying very much.

We're literally talking about handing a friend/family member something to take care of. If you know a way to "verify" without trusting during this process, I'm all ears. 


EVERYONE has first-hand supporting evidence of their friends and family members being more difficult to deal with than just doing something yourself. I'm not saying that everybody's mom is untrustworthy, but if you have the choice between handing your mom something to take care of for you versus taking care of it yourself, surely you can see the added problems by giving it away. (Ex: less access to it, distance, family politics, taking the time to explain it, etc.)
 


M of N instead of N of N. I get it... But I don't think any 'of N' will be acceptable to the public for reasons stated above. 


First of all, banks are the ones Bitcoin is threatening, and safety deposit vaults are often robbed by the banks themeselves, so that is literally the last place I'd keep a seed. What an easy thing for a bank to steal from you and claim it wasn't them.
Secondly, I never said I fear giving a piece of a key to anyone... Only that the public won't go for jumping through so many hoops.






The aforementioned Simbit and Cryptosteel metal seed cases. You have to store those in plain text, but there is a lot of other security features on them, including simply hiding these credit-card sized things or putting a padlock on them. Better yet, you can split your seed into 3 of these things and make your own M of N backups, hiding them separately from each other... Of course that makes it harder for an amnesia victim to find M vaults. 


Hate to say it, but it's still the only route that allows amnesia and inheritance options without tons of trust.


Then your obscurity sucks, but keep in mind that this isn't very different from hiding the paperwork to your legacy back accounts and IDs etc. that you'd typically put in a safe today. I'd prefer something better than physical security but putting a seed vault in a physical safe is already a bit better than the solutions we have via the legacy financial system. 


It's a multisig backup service for their full bitcoin nodes. Their approach is to treat your $200 casa bitcoin node as your homes "money server" and hold one of your keys for you. It's not the worst solution I can imagine.
 


Which is why you need a plaintext seed in physical or obscure hiding at home.

Like most things in life, no one hardware wallet is perfect for everyone.
If you aren't securing more than a couple hundred dollars' worth of funds, just get a good desktop wallet like Electrum or Wasabi. Or if you're an active spender, use a mobile wallet with lightning. (Again, less than $250 balance)
If you're really into the tech and want it to be perfectly safe as possible, (at the cost of extra difficulty to learn &amp; use) then buy a Coldcard. It's actually one of the cheaper options and has tons of security tweaks no one else offers.
If you're a typical user that wants the 'full package' with great security, but are willing to give up the very best in security, use the Trezor model T. (It's seed is only 12 words long though, meaning it's backup will be crackable someday unless they fix this well in advance.)
If you are into altcoin trading, and would be willing to give up the extra bells and whistles to be able to store more types of coins, and even change between them within your wallet, use the Ledger X. 
I haven't reviewed the Shift Bitbox, but I've heard good things. Stay away from the KeepKey, it's a less secure version of the ledger.
No matter what else you do, even if just getting a desktop/mobile wallet, be sure to back up your seed better than on a piece of flammable paper. I consider the Simbit or Cryptosteel seed lockers far more important to my security than any hardware wallet.

I've been HODLing since 2011 and it literally seems impossible to me nowadays for bitcoin to fail in the long run, eventually taking over as a global reserve currency. Bitcoin's market cap then, after all major currencies have collapsed and been eaten by it in a fit of angry hyperbitcoinization is completely inconceivable in today's terms; something close to (above actually) all the liquid money in the world today including all liquid assets.  A few Quadrillion dollars' worth in today's terms, at least. That would put each bitcoin worth multiple millions of dollars. Of course dollars won't exist by then but you could buy a really nice mansion with a couple of lambos in the garage for one bitcoin by then for sure. Maybe a Yacht parked in your own harbor, too. 
Yes, I'm fully aware of all the things that can go wrong that are still to come, but bitcoin's strengths, like it's unbeatable open source development community, are simply stronger and smarter and will easily overcome each of those problems.
And yes, I know very well that no one that got here in the last year or so agrees... This opinion takes time to develop, but you'll notice that LOTS of folks who were here since before 2013 feel the same way.

Once we have Neutrino fully implemented (and of course watchtowers well spread about) then Lightning bitcoin wallets that are as trustless as real lightning nodes will be available on everyone's phone.

There is a long and rich history of indian regulators hating on bitcoin. It's currently illegal for banks to work with crypto exchanges in the country, and a buttload of petitions from india's million+ rabid crypto fans have made it to the supreme court but the court has been sitting on the case since September last year, basically postponing it every day. (The end of this month is the next time they get a chance to do so)
The good news is that all the existing crypto exchanges in India (except zebpay who just left and went to a new country) were forced to get creative and came up with what they call "peer to peer exchange" where they act as a middleman to user-to-user trades... So banks are used much less and have no relationships with exchanges there.

3. While the CEO of OB1 and a few of his top guys did side with Segwit2x and deserve a good ribbing for the bad choice, they have always stayed adamant about OB remaining a primarily-Bitcoin platform. This is because:

Nobody builds PCs to mine bitcoins anymore. That was a thing in 2010-2013. Nowadays to make a profit on bitcoin mining the process looks like this:
1. Find a huge power source like a Dam or Nuclear plant that can sell you cheap electricity at bulk prices.
2. Build or rent a huge factory warehouse nearby it.
3. Secure an agreement with an exchange or other OTC trading desk to buy your coins at a good price, giving you the fiat currency you need when you need it to pay the power bill with.
4. Spend several million dollars worth on the very best mining hardware available today, and pay extra to get it shipped to you through customs.
5. Hire a bunch of teenagers to install the mining machines and keep them running.
6. Constantly crunch the numbers to know at bitcoin's fluctuating price if you should be running the miners that minute or not so you can cover the cost of your electricity bill. 
This is why 99.999% of all bitcoiners just buy their bitcoin now. If you're in China where exchanges are banned, then it's even harder... You do still have choices, but they are not perfectly legal.

Take it from someone who would have 10x as many BTC today if he hadn't followed this advice in 2012-13:
Today is the time to be (as much as possible) hodling. It will continue to be time for hodling until such a time comes as bitcoin as a Store of Value has become ubiquitous all over the world and payment methods that look like applepay or alipay that use the lightning network are on most every smartphone.
On that day, when bitcoin competes no longer to be the world's favorite store of value, but is in fact competing (strongly) to be the world's favorite payment method, that's the day when spending bitcoin will help grow adoption.

That's right, but what you don't seem to be grasping is that everyone already knows and thinks of bitcoin as Deflationary, because we're sure there will never be more than 21 millions coins in existence... And people lose coins forever on a weekly basis.
The inflation in your local fiat currency is caused by all the printing of new money... And it is assumed by everyone near and far that your central bank will print at an even faster rate in the future with no end in sight... They're already Planning to raise the rate at which they print... So everyone knows more money is coming into the economy, and therefore goods and services' prices must go up. 
With bitcoin, it's already the opposite. We all know less money is coming in 2020, and half as much still is coming in 2024, and all the way to 2100 or so when absolutely no money is coming in the future at all and the entirety of the 12 or so Billion people around that year will have to make due with the remaining 15 million coins in existence that year... So prices for stuff are already going down, and will continue to go down until a single satoshi buys something that a penny or at least a dollar buys today. Sub-satoshi pricing may happen too... a milli-satoshi exists on the lightning network already.

No, just referring to many conversations I've seen here, bitcointalk, CryptoTwitter, youtube, IRC &amp; even in telegram groups over the years. I've basically been searching for that ultimate solution since 2012. Nobody's got it all solved, but I have to give credit to those metal seed storage devices like Simbit and Cryptosteel. Nothing makes you feel as safe as one of those backing up a solid hardware wallet.


Interesting, I've never thought about lightning channels as a social choice on par with asking your brother to store a multisig key for you. I see the technical resemblance, but out here in meatspace it's a completely separate ball game.


For centuries people have been saying that about all kinds of things we've decentralized in the last few decades. Money first and foremost among them; Bitcoin is a slap in the face to that kind of thought and while I don't see the solution for the ultimate backup yet, I have decided not to give up on it.
Something like the metal seed storage needs to be a big part of that solution for the sake of memory loss, fire, &amp; inheritance. But something like default questions also needs to be able to get at our private key for the sake of the masses remembering their password. I also can't stress enough the ability to be able to access it anywhere from a distributed source... Make the 3rd parties as easy to connect with as the lightning network channels are... So perhaps nodes need to be run to keep this network up, which must be highly distributed and may need its own incentive layer to do so. There is still quite a lot left to figure out here, but no true showstoppers.

Where in the acronym "P2P" does it represent a middleman?
Back in the late 90's when Napster and eBay came out, but before Bittorrent existed, we already knew that the term P2P  didn't really mean what people were using it for. Anyone with any computer networking knowledge knew there would eventually be a true P2P one day. At the time we only had P2B2P, but the masses just don't understand jack about decentralized systems so the word stuck.

The fact is that before this, the 'little guy' (investors who don't have much to spend or time to waste with KYC) could only invest in crypto. That was BTC's main value prop to many small investors.
Now they can go straight from fiat to stocks, bypassing crypto.

Maybe only 10% of people here are real anarchists and would agree that the state is the enemy. The rest of 'em are still fully under the illusion that paying taxes is not theft, and involuntary government services like roads are something that no one else can provide if we all aren't extorted for them.
Most of the anarchists are all oldtimers now, and either they no longer post at all, or they have learned to only hint about anti-state themes here.

I'd say it's now dependent on 4 factors, instead of 3. 
Before decoy wallets came along, the 3 factors were 1) your ability to hide things, 2) your acting skills, and then 3) your pain threshold as a final line of defence. Now there's a new 2nd factor... After hiding them before you have to act now exists the decoy wallet... It is actually a modifier of the 2nd and 3rd lines, in fact, making them both stronger.
But best of all, your attacker would have to be well studied in the niche to know of their existence... The kind of thief that studies in depth items he wants to steal, rather than the average neighborhood thug, mugger, evil maid, or even cat burglar who happens across you and your stash.
There is, of course, another line of defence, called a gun. Living in a country where lots of folks have a gun makes the criminals much less likely to attempt a wrench attack too, because you could always pull a pistol out of your safe instead of what they came for.

I'm seeing 4 tiers naturally arise so far, but for the sake of good OpSec we should all strive to add more and more tiers in our personal security plan. (Such as a decoy wallet in case you have a gun to your head or maybe 2 tiers of hardware wallets to separate 'clean' from 'dirty' funds.)
**1st tier:** Web browser extensions, phone &amp; web wallets like [tippin.me]( and other fast-and-loose Custodial wallets including Blue that send and receive Lightning BTC. (Or non-lightning BTC too, for the time being before that becomes impractical.)
**2nd Tier:** Solid non-custodial software wallets. Tons of these exist for on-chain BTC, but for Lightning these would need stand-alone nodes, likely running Neutrino. (Lightning not as common on phones.)
**3rd Tier:** Software nodes, usually on machines running at home, such as a RasPi or Casa node. Full control but takes some know-how. (This will likely be the least popular tier in the future, but all businesses should do it. Investors will do this too in order to earn coin from Lightning channel fees.)
**4th Tier:** Non-lightning-only BTC stored in a Hardware wallet like a Trezor.  (Absolutely everyone with any savings should use this Tier.)

I guess it boils down to the fact that you either have a mind that can appreciate the power of saving value or you don't. Those that do become BTC Hodlers really quickly and those that don't can only imagine tiny uses like the silk road were everything.

You're not being fair to lightning here. Of course it's been taking a damn long time, but breaking new ground has been an every-single-week occurrence. This week has been doubly busy, and we've finally got the first implementation of AMPs yesterday which allows for larger payments to go through.

This is waaaaay to slow. Way way way way too slow.
If anything, the cycles should be closer, not further apart.  They are driven upwards by user adoption and hype, right? That's not slowing down, it's clearly accelerating as you can tell from many different indicators.
Then there's the halvenings. More and more people every day fighting over fewer and fewer coins. There will be a point at which sellers in the market will simply dry up because the coins produced by the buyers vastly outweigh the new supply.
At that point we'll hit the steepest point of the S-curve adoption. It might even look totally different than the previous cycles, but it surely isn't going to result in a slowly-rising price when suddenly the users coming onboard are multiplied by 10,000 overnight.

You've basically got the definition of Money wrong in your head.  Money is the most saleable (liquid) asset in any one place at a given time. Govt fiat is almost always the money within it's borders by decree; but take away the law or go to a closed system like a prison or school and other money rises to the top.
For most of written history, Gold has been that most saleable asset around the world. Gold isn't backed by anything either, and rose to become money in many different countries independently. This is exactly what bitcoin is doing now.
While we want Bitcoin to become money one day, it really is just an asset that comes with its own payment network (gold+paypal) until the mainstream catches on and it becomes popular enough to officially be money. It may take hyperinflation of the dollar for that to happen, but one day it absolutely will be money and I can't see anything stopping that in the long term.
@_date: 2019-02-20 02:03:57
Imagining any one event or 'shift' happening and overnight the mainstream sees bitcoin as a viable payment method sounds extremely naive to me. It will only happen after we've beaten them over the head with hundreds or maybe thousands of such events.

Ignoring all the financial revolution, politics, computer science advances, economics validation, and about 50 other subjects around bitcoin that has people from all walks of life really excited, there is one major difference, strictly speaking about market-traded assets, that you are overlooking.
It is the fact that Bitcoin is a new asset rising from zero, trying to find its price in this big world.
Imagine if Gold was literally just discovered among mankind in 2009. No one even heard myths about it before then, but from the start a bunch of nerds found it to be useful. What would the price start out at?
Probably about the same... $0.0025 per gold ounce. That's because the rest of humanity doesn't yet see the usefulness in gold yet, and no one but these nerds understands those uses. From there the price will grow as more people do find it useful, in jewelry, in electronics, in dental work, whatever we can think of in the first few decades. And as we do, more people will learn from the earlier people in a network effect, but limited to the hype cycles that are natural and expected in free markets.
This is simply how all new assets find their price in the world. Bitcoin has yet to find it's price, but if you simply compare the limited 21m issuance to the 8 Billion people alive that could find bitcoin useful one day, then it's a no-brainer to think the price has a long way to climb before it finds that price.

This is an issue, but one the Lightning devs have known about and combated from the start. There are several different ways they are fighting the problem.
For instance, one way is to batch-create channels. One TX can open a large number, I think it was 1,000 channels at a time splitting the amount between them. Serivces, acting like banks, can do that whenever they want, (such as when the mempool is empty) and then simply give the other end of each channel to new account signups one at a time.
Submarine swaps will also keep the load down, specifically when adding new money/capacity to existing channels. This is already live and working now. They allow channels to be refilled through an on-chain transfer from the Bitcoin blockchain to the off-chain LN channel.
The problem isn't as bad as it sounds in the first place, however, because so many people are going to be using custodial services, which aren't really on the blockchain yet. (ex: blue wallet) As much as we wish for people to secure their own keys, the masses are still highly unlikely to do so and will be using custodial lightning wallets in exactly the same way most bitcoin addresses are currently at custodial Bitcoin wallets. (Coinbase, Blockchain, exchange wallets, etc.) With that in mind, we have tons of time to build enough lightning channels. Probably until the very day Bitcoin becomes an everyone-must-have-bitcoin-to-function currency, worldwide.
@_date: 2019-12-16 09:54:57


The point is, once a good UX comes along, you'd never hear the world lightning nor have to think about "maintaining wallets" or channels. You'd simply get bitcoin and spend bitcoin faster. Period. Preferably, you'd get paid in bitcoin (instead o fiat) and then spend it. That's it.


What's delusional is thinking that going from $0.0025 in 2010 to $20k in 2017 is possible (8 million times) but going from $20k to $1 Million is not. (A mere 50 times.) Especially since less than 5% of the planet is holding bitcoin today. Imagine if 20% of the planet embraced bitcoin at the next spike...

I can't seem to mentally shake the fact that bitcoin's price is affected by both this "2 steps forward, 1 step back" bubble cycle and S-curve adoption both. S-curve happens to literally all technology advancements; it's inconceivable that we won't have a one, single steepest part of the adoption curve when the masses catch on and start using it as one huge adoption tidal wave. This is \*money\* we're talking about here, the most adoption-incentivizing thing we could possibly be talking about. The Steep part will come.
So if these stairstep bubbles keep happening every few years and the S-curve comes too, what in the heck is that going to look like? a 1000x bubble that only pops 25% afterwards?  It's really all new territory here.

This is the first semi-intelligent thing you've said on this thread. Yes, it's true that there is no guarantee that the public will value bitcoins the way that we hodlers do already. That's the only uncertainty in the whole equation.

Any decentralized alternatives working and not requiring crapcoins to use?
Video is hard to replace with decentralized alternatives, but I'm still holding out for one that actually is. It would necessarily have:
* To be node-based, like bitcoin.
* To allow for bitcoin payments over TOR.
* The payments go directly to node runners hosting the content.
* The content have to be sharded &amp; distributed into tiny chunks, widely spread &amp; replicated. 
* The interface to look like Bittorrent with a very easy UX.
* Profiles and comments hosted in a distributed manner as well.  
When someone can deliver all of that, then we can start talking about leaving youtube. Not before.

They only use the term "P2P" to describe this new operation type, but the rest of the transaction isn't P2P at all, just the fiat part... And the exchange is still in the middle taking fees and acting as an escrow agent.

It will be the most important growth decade of bitcoin's life, also noteworthy for hosting a huge war over the fate of bitcoin's Privacy. In 2020/2021 we'll race out of the gates with the next price spike, somewhere in the neighborhood of a $150k-$300k top before falling down 80% once again.
If the lightning network wallets are appealing to the masses during that spike, then bitcoin adoption will be on easy street... Half the planet will have a bitcoin wallet on their phones by 2022.   If they still lack UX during that spike, then it'll be another 4 or so years before we get another chance at mass adoption.
No matter the outcome, the next few years will be embroiled by the 2nd civil war... All about privacy. Do we keep bitcoin's base layer transparent enough for regulators to accept it as it is now? Or do we add all the base-layer privacy improvements to bitcoin that make all transactions more fungible? What a firework show that should be... Probably another Bcash-style Fork on the menu around then.
The world's currencies keep inflating away while negative interest rates are becoming more common quite rapidly. These are the perfect ingredients for people to look elsewhere to store their savings. So bitcoin's general adoption as a store of value (think: replacement for gold, savings accounts, IRAs, and offshore accounts) will keep increasing at a growing rate. It's only the payments side that is in question, and that all relies on UX improvements in the next year or so.
A 2nd price spike will also be coming along in another 4 years, which could potentially take us to a $1m bitcoin around 2024-25. If the UX improvements were ready and the masses start flocking in 2022, then yes, a $1m BTC would truly be possible. If not, then it'll obviously be a much lower top at that time. followed by another chance in another 4-5 years.
I also expect to see a central bank issue it's own -centralized- cryptocurrency in the first half of the decade, and can only imagine that it won't become as popular as their existing cash already is. That will very likely fizzle out quickly, but at the same time, it will add major legitimacy to Bitcoin, globally. 
Hopefully by the end of the decade we'll see governments start to buy bitcoins to add to their treasury instead of gold bars. As soon as word leaks to the press of any country on earth doing that, Bitcoin's legitamacy will no longer be in question anywhere.

On the micro level, sure. You're right. It hasn't done much besides adding a few laws each year and the dollar has been inflating about 2%-4% a year. That's not so bad, right?
Now think about that on the timescale of centuries. The roman empire failed HARD over the course of 100-400 AD. It's daily failures probably didn't look any different than ours. Slightly but consistently raising debt every year. Slightly but consistently less value in our money each year. Slightly but consistently more laws on the books and more taxes and more tax code and so on and so forth.
You've been conditioned to believe that these slight but consistent FAILURES of our republic are "normal."
**They are not normal.** They suck very, very badly and absolutly lead directly to the destruction of the country if not reversed.
Take the income tax, for instance. Did you know we didn't even have one until we had a federal reserve in 1913?
Before then taxes were very, very low. Something like 10% of your income went towards any and all taxes. Nowadays that number is well above 50%, and the crap we get back in return for this money is lesser and of lower quality.
This empire is certainly failing, and it has absoutely nothing to do with the current or next politician. It has to do with the ever-growing number of laws and taxes, and most importantly, the people's total and complete lack of desire to do anything about this situation.

What you're not getting here is that we all have an absolute need to see bitcoin's price make higher lows each and every single time at bottoms after ATHs. If bitcoin can't even give us higher bottoms after each cycle, our belief that number go up will be unjustified. Some of the longest-term hodlers would sell it all overnight on such an event.
Tone's calling for a lower low than anyone here wants to see. (And since we all feel so strongly about not wanting to see that, I'm pretty sure we won't.) Tone just isn't getting this at all; he thinks the TA chart techniques he learned from some youtube stocktrader overrides this feeling all bitcoiners have.

Gold may have been money for 5000 years, but it was never MONEY in your lifetime. We've been using fiat for the purpose of transacting. Gold's still useful as a way to save value, (store of value, savings account) but Bitcoin truly is far superior to it in every way and yes, we absolutely should be making public and loud comparisons to Gold.

We think that you have that brain disease where you mistakenly believe that bitcoin is primarily a payment network. It is not. 
Bitcoin is hard money first, competing with gold primarily but all kinds of savings accounts, IRAs, funds, precious metals and gems, and offshore bank accounts as well.  
It does also happen to be a payment network too, one that excels at crossing borders &amp; is censorship resistant. It is pretty unique at this task but until the lightning network is fully built out, it isn't meant to compete with paypal or Zelle.

The boating accident thing is a long-running meme here. I think goldbugs use it too.
But it's true that I'd have to report any coins I sell for fiat. Meanwhile, there is plenty you can buy with coins directly that doesn't stand out like a house or lambo. Luckily for me, I don't have any desire to own flashy items and have always lived like a minimalist. I pity those in bitcoin for the lambos. 
Some taxes will have to be paid, of course. I just got reacquainted with the long term capital gains rules earlier this month... But as more people start saving their wealth in bitcoin, taxation agencies are going to find they aren't collecting nearly as much as they used to. Not only is it easier to hide the money's existence, but people will be saving more in general simply because their wealth is in a deflationary form, paying them more for waiting.

Don't forget that hodling won't be as attractive to so many after another bubble or two and then the price stabilizes.

It's KEYS to your addresses that you must always protect, not the coins themselves. Coins live in the cloud and never leave it.
Your private keys are the important things, and just like keys to your front door, they aren't valueable themselves but they let anyone who can get them from you into your house where they can steal all your valueables.
Don't leave your keys online where some exchange may lose them or get hacked... Always send your bitcoins to a wallet that you and you alone control, so you hold and can protect your own keys.

This is just how bitcoin behaves, as it has demonstrated many times before.
\&gt; Do you ever consider that maybe the price won't continue to exponentially rise in the future?
Of course it can't continue exponentially... It just has 10x -20x jumps that look exponential before losing 75%-85% afterwards every few years.
And no, it can't even keep doing that forever; eventually it's market cap would become larger than the supply of money on the planet so I'm sure after 2 more surges (2025?) the fall can't go as far down anymore, and the surges can't go as high up anymore... Volatility will have to level out.

Look here, banklover... For centuries there has been a distinct lack of competition in the money supply. States, through their monopolizing central bank, have made it the law of the land in all lands to be the only issuer of money. That gives them the ability to print at will and cause hyperinflation, which is always happening somewhere on the planet at any given time. It's a constant problem and governments show no desire whatsoever to solve it by allowing private money to exist.
So we solved that problem by creating a money that they can't control and doesn't inflate. Saying otherwise makes you sound like a retard. You may not want to adopt it, but those that say something can't be done really should move their asses out of the way of those doing it.

Usually the same thing. In the world of crypto, everything is a long, random string of numbers and letters. The longer, the more secure. 
When a bitcoin address or whole wallet is created (hint: a better name for bitcoin wallet would have been keychain, not wallet... It only exists to hold multiple keys) two "keys" are always created... A "public key" that you can share with other people, and a longer "private key" that you must always keep hidden.
Most wallets (hardware &amp; software) hide those private keys and help you send and receive transactions to your public key. The better the wallet, the less you have to actually deal with or even think about the keys themselves. Devs work hard on making the process easy enough for a grandma to use.

Exactly... And I attribute the reason for that slowdown to bitcoin's marketcap running out of money to eat.
For instance, we'll never see a billion dollar bitcoin in today's dollars... There just isn't that much liquid value in the world. All the currencies and all the trade-able assets together don't equal 21 million x $1 billion.
So as bitcoin's price grows, it has to slow down that rate because it obviously can't overshoot.
Good thing, too... If the price could keep growing forever, the Volatility would never stabilize. (And therefore bitcoin would never become useful as cash.)

Bank script in the US was short lived and it's been over 100 years since we got stuck with the Fed. But the point is that even those banks were issuing a US dollar, not a "Chase Dollar" or "Citi Dollar." The value of them all was the same, dictated by the government. That's still a state monopoly over money.
I don't know what your definition of money is, but the Austrian definition (which makes it the only sane one) is being the most liquid asset. Yes, the dollar is still the most liquid asset in the US for now, but it's losing ground to bitcoin quickly and mostly that's it's own fault because of how fast the fed is printing new dollars.  Plus, the dollar isn't truly global, whereas bitcoin is. Bitcoin is already more liquid than dollars are in some places.

Meanwhile, Vitalik traipses around with authortarians like friggin' Putin and is worshiped as a demigod by his faithful followers.

Technically, yes, but after watching it do this in 2011, twice in 2013, then in 2017, it's now pretty easy to see how this next bull market is going to turn out as well. Of course something unexpected could always happen, but the pattern is pretty strong and it only makes sense that bitcoin would have to go through many spurts of huge gains in order to grow big enough to become a global money one day.

If you bought at ATH and 'have no joy' because of the price today, then all I can say to you is keep zooming out and look at the bigger trendline. It's obvious to everyone with any patience and the care to investigate that bitcoin will hit new ATHs in the future, and when it does they'll each be an order of magnitude higher than the previous one. There is still joy to be had in the anticipation for that date if you're a hodler.
As for the 2011 silk road buyers, these are the guys who didn't believe in BTC enough back then to hodl, but have since had 8 years of watching bitcoin's behavior in the markets.

You should be concerned that there exists a central group of people, even a foundation, that has the ability to cash out large chunks like that at all.  They could manipulate the market at the very least. Likely did so.
Were you here in 2014/15? Every single day on this board was a complaint about the Bitcoin Foundation's existence. They didn't even have a large number of coins, just influential members. We had to fight tooth and nail to disband that centralizing entity, but eventually won. Ethereum should do the same if it wants to call itself decentralized.

Usage = 3 different things, because bitcoin is trying to become money. All money is a SoV, MoE, and UoA by definition.
Until bitcoin came along, we haven't had the pleasure of seeing a new form of money arise. Apparently we are learning with bitcoin that Store of Value must come first and must be global. Only after the whole world feels they can store their value in bitcoin will I expect to see MoE and finally UoA come along too.

You give way too much credit to coinbase. There have been dozens and dozens of exchanges that went under or disappeared with people's coins in the dead of night. MtGox was the ONLY bitcoin exchange in 2011-2012, and still had 85% of the planet's volume when it went under. 
QuadringaCX, Canada's biggest exchange, went under very recently with ALL COINS LOST from their cold storage because the CEO died and didn't share the keys to them properly.
The point is that storing a peice of paper with 12-24 words on it can be done very safely if you put your mind to it. People have been securing their stuff like that since we were cavemen. 
What the exchanges are doing today is BRAND NEW and prone to failure.

I brought up their ripoff bonds because that's what you have to invest in these days to get a Guarantee on  your money. The going rate appears to be -2% on guarantees. 
Big company stocks have a better downside than crypto but not much of an upside. Compare an entire decade's performance of any stock to Bitcoin's decade of life and it's pretty obvious which people should be holding. Bitcoin's up 2.2 million TIMES right now since pizza day.
\&gt; you're insane to think BTC is going to run to $250k+ in under a year  from a price of $5k. Even the highest increases before weren't that  fast.
But they were though, that's the thing. Look at the peaks and valleys of bitcoin's history. From each major peak, the next peak is higher by 10x-20x. What is 15x up from our last peak of $20k?  $300k. Of course it'll fall 70-80% afterwards, but my $250k prediction at peak is quite conservative considering bitcoin's history.

Yes, there's a big assumption here, but once you have seen it happen 2, 3, or 4 times before already that assumption gets pretty hard to ignore.

Nope, it sounds like you've got a bit of impatience there... 
The chart is exactly correct because the public at large still barely knows about bitcoin at all, usually only if they watch financial reporting on mainstream news. (Which is negatively slanted.) For them to come to trust it and think of it as more secure than they do now is going to take years, unfortunately.
By the time the world truly sees bitcoin as a reliable store of value it will have absolutely consumed huge existing markets like offshore banking and even a majority of the value of all precious metals. Acheiving SoV alone will make bitcoins worth $1m each EASILY. 
The rest will come much faster after that point. The fight is allll before the SoV point if you ask me.

All increases to the block size (even the one that was in segwit) make bitcoin less censorship resistant in that fewer people will run nodes as the blockchain gets bigger.
Luke-jr's crazy-sounding 400k blocksize proposal illustrates this quite well... Because we started at a whole 1MB, we could never run our nodes on smartphones.  Even as phones get larger hard drives, the blockchain's size grows to match, meaning it may never fit on a smartphone, ever. 
The damage is done now; I see little point going down to that small of a blocksize at this point, but why increase beyond some other devices' limit?
Simply put; Raising the blocksize has both seen and unforseen problems. Building 2nd layer solutions is the smarter play by far.

The $1m bubble is clearly 2 bubbles away, so I'm looking for it to happen in about 5-6 years from now.
The upcoming bubble around 2020 is going to take us over $100k, I'd say $250k or even $300k likely at the very top.
For a few uncomfortable days there at that top, banks will be wetting themselves, likely trying to stop all TXs with the words "Bitcoin" or "Crypto" on them at all.
However, we have decentralized exchanges now like Bisq so many folks won't care; banks won't be a part of their world anymore. (Obviously the mainstream won't be that savvy yet.)
But then the price will fall 75%-80% again, let's say back down to a new low of $50k over the period of a few months in 2021 or 2022.
Few will have noticed the small but real damage done to the the world's fiat currencies that time; at $250k the market cap of bitcoin alone will be $4.5 trillion, which of course frees up a lot more fiat than the mainstream will have thought possible. I think banks will try to hide this from the world, somehow, and make the situation appear just like the 2017 bubble. As we come back down to $50k or so, fiat will seem to repair itself and the world won't have crashed yet. There just aren't enough people believing in BTC yet, but this will open up a lot more eyes.
4-5 years later, the damage dealt to fiat on the rise to $1m will most definitely cause a major, global, inflationary event. It'll be quite chaotic and painful for many, I'm sad to report. But Bitcoin's superiority will become obvious and most of humanity will finally know they can't avoid holding onto some bitcoin as savings at that point.
Some things we'll see on the way up to that:
* Smaller countries start adding BTC to their national reserves
* The super rich start choosing bitcoin over offshore banking
* The weakest fiat currencies will throw in the towel
* Although govts may never call it legal tender, BTC will become the defacto money in some small countries
* Bitcoin's volatility will sink to levels similar to today's fiat currencys' volatility
* Gradually but slowly, bitcoin will become used in mainstream, cashlike payments (Walmart by 2028?)
* Central banks will be fruitlessly trying to launch their own crypto, which simply won't catch on unless forced on their citizens. If they do, they'll likely be tradeable for bitcoin and start inflating again anyway
* We hodlers will start to be seen as the new elites, and the people with the most hardship will hate us, no matter what we do for them
Will banks fold and go away?
No. They'll all turn into Coinbases, basically. There won't be a need for so many branch offices though, so their appearance in society will be much less obvious.
It's the central banks that need to worry the most; after it becomes obvious that their digital fiat can't compete with Bitcoin, (2035?) economists worldwide will have no choice but to declare Keynesianism a failed experiment and embrace both bitcoin and the deflationary economy as proper.

Let that sink in.
If you earned your bitcoins in 2010, and in 2030 spend 5 bitcoins on a megayacht, They're going to expect their Capital Gains tax on the fiat worth of those 5 BTC in 2030. That's it, and that's all. It's called "long term gains" but so is BTC earned in 2029.

Decentralization is not a switch you flip on or off. For a project, such as Bitcoin or Bitorrent, to be so decentralized that it can stand up to government-level attack, you have to have done many things right from the start. -Such as not having any human being in charge of it.
Humans like Vitalik &amp; Garlinghouse are centralized points of control that every single government is going to want to force into making them do something, like put backdoors in it, or if it grows really popular, hand over a huge chunk of the supply... Anything and everything they can do to seize control. This is simply what governments do, and they have no qualms about jailing you until you comply. Naturally, Bitcoin's Immaculate conception (Satoshi disappeared) is extremely rare and useful in this respect. Other coins don't want to follow Satoshi's path because of greed.
And that's only one type of centralization. There is centralization of geography, of internet IP space, of mining, of nodes, of development in general, of media even, the list goes on. Any one of these becoming fully centralized is an existential threat to bitcoin.
The fact is, that bitcoin is the only one that is even remotely close to decentralized on all levels. Mining could be better, but it is in fact light-years beyond the decentralization of the miners of all other coins.

But he's waiting for it to be reliable before adding that. 
Sadly, the rest of his team all turned out to be Bcashers, and they overwhelmed him trying to get every altcoin under the sun, especially bcash, into OB. Brian allowed a few more coin wallets (4 in total) to go into it, but held firm at keeping BTC the default coin of OB.

Wish I had the time to lay the arguments out for you, but they're not light reading at all.
Think of it this way though; Gold must have taken several Centuries before it was accepted everywhere. Bitcoiners know that we face an uphill battle to do the same, but with the internet we're hoping to make it happen in less than half a century... Maybe 30 years if we're lucky and governments keep hyperinflating on their present course.
So yes, price is very much at the whims of speculative bubbles in the meantime, but it's growth has been awesome as part of the 30-year trend towards becoming huge enough to support usage as a worldwide money.
Test it for yourself; look at the chart zoomed out to all 10 years and pick any 3-year period on it... All of them are growth periods. What terrible problems have befallen BTC in order to change such a trend?

Most of history had it better than right now as far as socialistic statism is concerned. For most of a millennia in Ireland they had almost a pure anarchy until a few hundred years ago; local fiefdoms were the top of the power structure for the entire island until England conquered them. Sure it was a more brutal time and we'd miss our electricity and all, but the people there had few complaints about others stealing a large percentage of their productivity and limiting their freedom of choice. 
In today's world there are far better 'systems' in other countries. Take Estonia or Lichtenstein, for instance. Very hands-off but tech-savvy governments in those two countries. I'd still want to totally remove the power structure one day, but to say we don't have systems nor tools to create anything better ignores all the 'better' that is around us every day already.

There are a few seed generation routines out there, such as the most popular one, BIP39:
Some allow you to add things like your own password to the string of seed words, and if you did so on one platform, another platform that doesn't use that same seed generation routine won't be able to read it. 
So it's basically very important that you know which wallets out there are compatible with your wallet's seed. I have often wished a chart existed... If you're doing the research anyway, this would be a great project that the community will thank you for posting.

Yes. You absolutely can have a channel that you are sure will never be spied on nor recorded. 
Of course if one of the authorized nodes is compromised, just like with TOR it can see what a node is supposed to see.
Taking this concept one further, imagine firing up a whole altcoin just for using it with this strategy... Then atomic swapping from bitcoin to that single-use altcoin's blockchain, moving it from one address to another there, then back to bitcoin in the other party's hands via a second atomic swap!  Once all the nodes on that blockchain have been deleted (easy if the two of you make up every node) there literally would be no blockchain to have a history of.

True... A third motive would be laundering cash. People with ill-gotten gains will happily spend it on less-than-top-rate miners and mine at a loss as long as they are not losing too much.
A fourth would simply be those who have 2nd-rate mining rigs but are willing to mine at a loss because they deeply believe that before they run out of money to pay the power bill the price of bitcoin will go up enough to compensate.

The problem I have with S&amp;R being a replacement for hodling is that if the price moves against you, you're unlikely to R anytime soon.  It's risky where hodling is a sure thing.
I think the merchants not dumping is purely comprised of people who are already hodlers in the first place, so your second point seems a bit pointless. 
However the idea to put buyback orders in with limits should indeed help decrease volatility. I don't often use a regulated exchange so I haven't thought about that before, but yes, if we can get lots of people doing this strategy I'd feel much better about S&amp;R. Maybe call it something like "Spend &amp; Replace With Limit Orders" or similar to differentiate it from the more risky type.

I don't think we can know that. There are already more ways to load your LN channel now than anyone imagined back in 2015, and who knows how many more will be dreamt up by 2020. 
Even if not though, the fact is that we still have on-chain TXs for bigger sums, we still have Liquid, Bakkt, and other networks that use Bitcoins as their value layer, and you can bet your bottom satoshi that we'll still have custody networks everywhere like we do today at exchanges and webwallets....

Not really. TOR's weakness should be viewed much more like a 51% attack on Bitcoin... A snooper has to control so many of the exit nodes (and there are massive numbers of them) that he has a high probability of being the endpoint node (not just one hop in the middle) for a particular communication to be able to track it.
Even that can't tell them everything about the sender, but if they control a very large percentage of exit nodes then they can know a little about everyone using TOR.
Luckily, there's little reason to think they aren't swamped for now. TOR volunteers are at an all-time high.

Timelocks absolutely suck. I wouldn't USE one if you put a gun to my head. Decoy wallets are the best we're ever going to do IMHO.


Then you've failed the game before you started playing. This game should be played on the stage of not leaking such information.
You already know that you shouldn't keep all your coins on a single address. You should make your personal system of storage multi-tiered while your at it, so you biggest pot of value is the most hidden, both physically and OpSec-wise. Your best hardware wallet with a 24-word seed that is fireproof, duplicated, and hidden extremely well. Basically only you can know about its existence. You only use it to load and send money to wallet 
Wallet # 2 is a middle-tier hardware wallet to spend very rarely from, with strongly hidden seeds once again, but this wallet is to be used each month or so to send money down to your 'hot' wallet.
The hot wallet is one you don't hide as well, don't keep as much on, possibly only exists in software, and most importantly, HAS A DUMMY WALLET TOO, with just enough money in it that the attacker doesn't get suspicious.
Your most frequent spends come from the hot wallet. Everyone online who sees you accept money, sees you accept it to the hot wallet only. The dummy wallet acts as yet another tier... See where I'm going with this?
Every tier is another layer of obfuscation away from your nest egg. No attacker is going to chase up a 3rd or definitely not a 4th layer even if  they found out you had a 2nd layer.

Scaling has barely been a speedbump to currency adoption. Few people seem to remember that when the mempool was filling up in 2017, and the fees were getting huge, the fact is that investors didn't notice one bit and google searches were off the charts at that time.
The 2018 crash wasn't due to big fees; fees had been huge for months. The crash was a natural bubble correction due to the super-hot ICO market that was majorly caused by Korean investors.
It's tempting to think bitcoin "failed" as a currency at that time due to high fees, but bitcoin simply wasn't being used as a currency for more than a handful of us true believers yet. Hundreds, maybe, out of many millions of investors and traders. 
So far 90+% of bitcoins have been used for investment, and it looks like it will remain this way until the Lightning Network gives people something that feels like a better money to them. (On-chain bitcoin could never deliver that experience.)
@_date: 2019-01-13 05:35:02
Right now we really aren't penalized for having "dirty" money. It would be very rare to have some coins in your possession that were directly involved with a known heist or kidnapping or something serious, and the blockchain analysis guys know that.
There isn't another tier below that right now that would be penalized by any merchants I've heard of. Coins involved with a silk road drug sale aren't going to be refused, at least yet.
The point is making bitcoin so fungible that they never will be. People mix coins in the hope that blockchain analysis businesses will fail and go out of business. So it's important that we mix enough now, before something like a silk road drug coin becomes "too dirty" to use. If we don't adopt the tech, then the BA businesses survive, and then those coins will eventually be refused and bitcoin is known to be less fungible.
There are, of course, possible solutions in the bitcoin protocol itself to fight for adding fungibility too, but no guarantees on when they'll arrive.

As the Austrian school points out, you can't have money without it being a store of value first.
No one created gold coins at a time when gold was worthless. It became a valueable collectable first, and then, gradually, that valuable thing began to be useful in trade, then it was used so much it became money.
Calling things "a currency" is pointless unless you're a government with the strength to make people use it as one.

Bitcoin competes as both a technology and a money.
On the tech side, of course. 
On the money side, good luck trying to beat Bitcoin's hardness. 
Some argue that with good enough tech, you can make better money, but with bitcoin we've learned that money isn't simply made; it's formed in consensus.

But don't underestimate how much further we have to go... Many people that have never heard of bitcoin yet can still become millionaires by investing a modest sum &amp; just hodling.
So instead of the 100,000,000x returns we could have made investing in 2010, we can can now only look forward to 10,000x returns. Sounds like a lot less, but compare 10,000x to  what you can expect from a good mutual fund.

1st of all, no. My high school economics course certainly never told us that we went off the gold standard, much less the importance of the gold backing the dollars. He likely had no appreciation for backing them. Like almost everyone else in the world, I didn't take econ at university. I don't know of anyone else who learned in high school that we were off the gold standard, although occasionally smart teachers sometimes are allowed to keep their jobs in towns that don't have a more liberal hiring alternative. 
2nd of all, the gold shock was 1971, not '73. 
3rd, the very idea of hard money is an austrian economics concept. Keynesians don't see any difference between hard and soft money; only money that is 'properly backed by the full faith in the government' is kosher to them.

It's  the ideal replacement for central bank money, ie settlement. Those are  the real fiat units of account, not the paper rectangles you have in  your wallet.

No, I'm talking about the weeks or months preceding the 85% falls we've had. There's been at least 5 times since 2011 that bitcoin's price shot up several multiples of itself over weeks and reached new highs, such as the 2013 and 2017 ATHs. these were climbs of 10x at least, 20x in 2017. However, when those bubbles popped, the fall was spectacular, down 85% or thereabouts.  
It would only make sense for you to say we could be in for an 85% drop now if we had just seen a new ATH in 2019. There will therefore be no more 85% drops until we've seen a price above 10x of the last ATH, so, somewhere around $200,000. (But I'd say the range would be somewhere between $130,000 and $330,000.)
Personally, I'll be looking for a $200,000 or higher ATH sometime next year, after halvening, and then a drop to something like $35,000 at the lowest point afterwards.

Just like with bitcoin, many/most will want to use a custody service/wallet that needs to know something about you.

Unlike on Bitcoin, the actual payments themselves are routed without any information that can be tracked by people simply grabbing your address (you don't have one in lightning) and going to a blockchain explorer. (Lightning doesn't have one of those either.)

Comparing it to a stock is where people keep going wrong, however. Stocks are ownership in shares of a company, while Bitcoin is an asset like gold. Assets are priced the way they are as a function of usefulness divided by scarcity. How much people want to own it over how many units there are available to obtain. That's it.
Bitcoins are both extremely useful as a store of value. Like Obama said, it's a Swiss bank in your pocket. Your job is basically to guess how much people feel a literal Swiss bank in their pocket is worth to them and divide that by 21 Million coins. Once you've found the correct dollar amount, just keep longing bitcoin until it gets to that amount... Shouldn't be too many more years now, I'd say just 5-9 more.

The conspiracy was never over the hiding of inflation; it is over the fact that there are freakin' alternatives that we were never presented with!
Even basic alternatives are not taught in schools, except only for Mises as far as I've heard.
Never\* does a president run on a platform of ending the fed reserve system. Never do they say let's move to a deflationary money. Never do they offer to even get us out of the extreme spending in things like multiple constant overseas wars. They system is simply set up to make sure we keep spending far more than any budget can afford, so constant debasement of the laughably weak, UNBACKED money supply is the only option we are taught that it is possible.

You're right. Satoshi designed *actual* money, while Keynes only designed this fake sh!t that we should never have been using in place of money.


Stop moving the goalposts. I didn't say "to replace fiat," I referred to Satoshi's plan for a 0% inflation schedule. You had just said "0% inflation is impossible to maintain." -Which any competent economist knows is defined by how much money is added to the supply. Inflation = Supply increase. Bitcoin will never have a coin # 21 million-and-one. It just can't happen because Satoshi's plan is to keep halving the issuance every 4 years, and no node runner is going to download and run any software that says otherwise.

Liquid is layer 2 though; nothing at all on layer two needs to use any of the foundations laid out in the whitepaper... The point in layer 2 is having lots of options so that if one fails in any way you still get your TPS from many others.
Even if you just considered layer 2 to be all of the centralized custody accounts that exchanges and payment services like bitpay offer, they are succeeding at serving the purpose of layer two, which is to get transactions off the blockchain, giving the overall bitcoin network a higher TPS. (i.e. Scaling)
This is why Lightning is so exciting... It gets pretty much infinite TXs off of the blockchain when widely used and is much more decentralized than most layer 2 offerings.
Liquid is somewhere inbetween. Yes it's still centralized, but not as much as an exchange or bitpay is. Plus, it offers far, far, far more TXs than they do because it's a big, fat pipe between exchanges.
Also, since they offered the elements code it's running on as an open source offering, any exchanges anywhere can run their own liquid-like sidechain federations, which would of course be good for bitcoin as it offers another layer two offering beside all these others.

Rubberhose was unique in that it was the first such system to have the premise that a main account would be more hidden if you had a secondary account to log in with a different pin number...

I'd only recommend multisig if you're in a very rare position where you have access to some very solid, assured separate parties or locations to store the keys that are basically failproof.

Is your node "listening?" (listening=1 setting in bitcoin.conf) 
That setting causes high bandwidth, but for a good cause. 
If so, you're basically donating a lot of extra bandwidth to the bitcoin network by allowing more than 8 peers to connect to your node. 
Nodes, by default, all pass around TXs and Blocks to spread them to other nodes on the network. Lots of connected peers (which you can see by hovering the connections icon in the very bottom right of your bitcoin app's window) means lots of bandwidth.

But 1m is waaaay more than 20x from 20k. It's like 45x or thereabouts.  He's got no chance.

Fiat is sent from the sellers bank account directly to the buyer's bank account without any escrow. 
A smart contract escrows the crypto until the buyer says he got the fiat in his account.
If he lies about it, then a moderator can be brought in for a fee.

\&gt; "I prefer risk it with a third party who has more incentives than me to dont lose their money"
Meanwhile, the existing banking systems of the world have all proven on a nearly daily basis that they can and will STEAL your money in a hundred different ways, from tiny fees to financial system meltdowns. 
\&gt; "I trust more their security then my own security." 
How embarrassed you're going to be if you happen to read that again in a few years. I'm already embarrassed for you.
\&gt; "Most of people who secure their bitcoin lost them over the years."
Wow. If by "most" you mean "a few examples that the media likes to hold up and popularize," sure.

Not unprecedented at all. Bitcoin has very strong-headed bull &amp; bear markets. 
It's long been noted that in a bull market no bad news can bring the price down but good news does give a little boost. Bear markets see the exact opposite too.

Meltem's awesome and I couldn't be happier with her being such a public face for the industry... But her three trends underlying the price seem off to me. I bet Brad Sherman had more to do with this price rise than any of those 3 things.

Most likely they'd make it illegal to own equipment to access that band. Their version of the FCC has the ability to make people disappear and the Chinese people aren't likely to test their limits like we have in the states.

History is absolutely chocked full of attempts to do so. Starting with the 1st National Bank back in Hamilton's time. President Jackson made it his life's mission to destroy central banking, but then rich bankers come along with lots of money and change the laws back within a few short years, every single time.
Control over Money has to be taken away from them; there is no other antidote.

Is there any other redemption process mentioned on the card other than going to those two domains? If not I'd use the contact form on bitcoin dot com (Roger Ver's site, don't get your hopes up!) to ask them how to redeem this card now that their 'redeem' subdomain is offline.

Sure, but if govts buy up the supply, then suddenly the price shoots north of $1m while we're sitting on far more than they are. Smaller govts will be lucky to get their mitts on 10 or even 1 bitcoin eventually while we have 17+ Million of them between us.   Talk about a dramatic power shift! Anyone wanna buy eastern Europe?

That gold standard would quickly become a centralized hub, unfortunately. 
As the world grows more and more decentralized, the new "gold standard" would be complete decentralization which means a protocol made out of open source code and many companies offering their various versions of a product based on that protocol.
Anything less is simply prone to censorship, seizure, and privacy problems.

Sure, but that's not a fast problem to overcome. Normies generally don't adopt illegal things more than just on the fringes... Of course it won't be illegal everywhere so we still have a strong path forward.

You really have to be more careful when accusing people of racism. It's obvious from his feed that he wants to draw attention to some stupidity on the progressive side of the fence, but it's completely unfair to put these retweets in the same basket as Alex Jones or even call them racist. 
To point to some wrongdoings without pointing to all wrongdoings does not inherently make you an enemy of the victims of the wrongdoings you failed to point out... There are only so many hours in the day and only so much care we can take the time to talk about on a twitter feed.
As far as I know, he's never tweeted about the cruel abuse to circus dwarfs, either... Does this make him a dwarf hater?

160 not enough? You think they need to be shorter still? I don't think adoption would suddenly go through the roof if you halved the length of public keys...
I've heard a lot of rumblings about SHA256 being compromised by quantum computing one day soon, but the cryptographers in the community, who should know way better than I, say that it wouldn't break enough of bitcoin to make it so you can steal someone else's coins. At any rate, banking cryptography should be WAY easier to crack than bitcoin because they're still using SHA224. That should push people away from banks and into bitcoin if it's a threat at all.

I would imagine that the antennas needed to receive Elon's signals aren't already in circulation... So they'll make it illegal to sell them and probably make a law saying that the whole section of the spectrum Elon is using is off limits to device manufacturers.
...Which makes it unlikely (but not impossible) that China would be a manufacturer for US products that access this. S. Korea, Taiwan, or another manufacturing hub will likely step up and do it.
