Can we also stop with the "stop with this" comments?
Yes, we know. The Greek crisis is not about Bitcoins, and Bitcoin can't solve the Greek crisis.
But for those Greeks with the know-how and ability, Bitcoin can save them a lot of heartache.
If there's one thing we *don't* need to be worried about, it's a mass exodus of Greeks from Euro to BTC.

I am honestly extremely curious what happens when debtors realize Bitcoin puts their wealth out of reach to traditional garnishment and levy, and I am extremely worried what happens when governments (lobbied by creditors) realize debtors are using it for that purpose.

Far right checking in. So, on top of the fact that the older generation is highly skeptical of anything digital, the gold investment industry basically owns the far right media (at least in the US). Listen to Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, etc., and you will inevitably hear some cringe-worthy radio spot pimping actual gold or investment vehicles derived from gold.
I love BTC, but I would guess it will take the "far right" longer than just about anybody to get behind it.

I agree with others saying that it's possible she shouldn't use it; but I'm pretty normal, and here's why I use it:
- Not garnishable/levyable (nobody wants to talk about this for some reason, but it's true)
- No maximum withdrawal amount per day, week, month
- No penalty for too low a balance.
- No (virtually) cost to withdraw, spend or transfer
- Posts light-years faster than a CC payment (at my bank, at least)
Some of those things are mitigated for you depending on what bank you use. Mine kinda sucks, but I have a pretty substantial line of credit with them so I can't really just pick up and move (without juggling multiple bank accounts). So I guess
- Bitcoin will never try to sell you a credit account.

Um... wasn't BTC up quite a bit during the period May-June? I'm just looking at the bitcoinity.org charts. Not 89%, but it sure does cut into how impressive 89% is when buy-and-hold over that period would have yielded 50%.
Seems like a decent chance they just got lucky, riding the rise in May and missing the drop in June. I bet I could come up with a predictive trading algorithm that does pretty well with stocks that jump 50% in value, too.
If they did the same thing from June-September, I would be impressed. But I'm suspicious, seeing as that performance didn't make the article...

I wouldn't necessarily call (most of) them trolls; people are obviously legitimately skittish about using Bitcoin in ways that can be perceived as money laundering or money exchange, because of the propensity we've seen for prosecutors and cops to liberally interpret those. And it isn't necessarily obvious that any of the measures I posted would actually mitigate that risk (not just of SWAT, but of any legal involvement); only reimburse you on the other side.
Even though it was just one guy, he *was* raided, and while Purse.IO says he has been made whole, and it hasn't happened again anywhere else, that doesn't mean all users would be okay with taking the risk.
For example, some folks don't own their own home, and it would be pretty difficult to explain to the owner that he needs a new door (which an internet company he has never heard from will pay for!) because we wanted to save a couple bucks on Amazon. Even at a small probability, the downside isn't worth it.
That said, my first order is being fulfilled now. If I get raided, I'll be sure to let everybody know. ;)

The question I was responding to was from yesterday, as was my response. The question didn't ask about specific exchanges. I provided an example.
And the difference between BTC-e and MTGox has been _extremely_ constant over time. BTC-e has always been lower than the other exchanges. MTGox has always been higher. You can see it on the chart I provided- it's always about 1/6 the value. So what makes you think you can exploit that for profit? It's the cost of doing business on MTGox vs. BTC-e. I challenge you to "make a killing" off of it. Prove me wrong.

I don't think so, so long as they're taking it after service, or for services that could be pre-paid without a client funds account before.
I know when we accept funds in advance in my state, we have to throw everything into IOLTAs and provide accounting to the client- this would be a bit of a problem with Bitcoin obviously, because I don't think the state fund would be super happy about getting their interest payments in BTC. It's easy enough to just take dollars for those transactions, though.

Out of curiosity, how does this work without a friend in the other country?
I'm travelling overseas and, even though I will be spending USD, my banks want to charge me 3% on every debit/credit transaction. If I could avoid that, it'd be swell...
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:00:17
Because this step is not investment-neutral:




All else being equal, rewarding a merchant who accepts Bitcoin is, in and of itself, an investment. You don't need to think of it as evangelizing Bitcoin- it is perfectly rational as an attempt to ensure the long-term survival of your remaining BTC holdings. Similar to brand loyalty where stock is held, or favoring purchasing a vehicle from the company your family works for (not considering incentives, etc.). It's a marginal effect, no doubt; but an effect nonetheless.
Also, if you think people aren't paying fees to get their fiat to merchants, you're smoking a new breed.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:35:44
Hey, me too! Except I also realize that those fees get passed on to me. Ever by gas with a credit card? Where I come from, they literally charge you less for cash. Of course, unless I take the time to walk into a bank to withdraw the cash, I paid a fee to get it, too. And any other fees they basically feel like charging from time to time on my account.
If I want the fiat from any place _other_ than my banks ATM (or even my banks ATM if it's outside a certain, undescribed geographic area,) I pay my bank a fee, and the ATM a fee. I have also been charged balance lookup fees for using my own bank's ATMs. Don't get me wrong- they can't charge me most of these fees. A phone call, a hold, and an argument later, they usually go away. But all of that, in my mind, adds up to one huge, non-USD-denominated fee.
Oh, and did I mention the fees to get the fiat _to_ my bank? Or the fees if I _don't_ put fiat in my bank?
Even if you have the best bank in the world, my guess is if you add up the fees you've paid since opening your account, it will total more than you will _ever_ pay in exchange fees on Bitcoin. Now, if you go and lose a wallet with thousands of dollars in it, that's obviously the flipside.
Maybe it isn't for you. Maybe it's less. But fiat is _not_ free. Not by a long stretch.

That was the difference in price between bitstamp and MTgox from my original comment. If you meant something other than the difference between Bitstamp and MTGox, I'm all ears. If you specifically meant that was the difference between BTC-e and MTGox, [show me where](


Doesn't exist. That "standard" was when the "standard" price for BTC was $200. The price changes, so does 10% of the price. But you seem to have a particularly hard time grasping that. I used prices at the time OP asked. They were an example. The example worked. Other examples, using other exchanges, also work. BTC-e to MTGox works. BTC-e to bitstamp works. BTC China to BTC-e works.
Show me a point where it doesn't, that lasts more than 20 minutes, and we can talk about an available arbitrage opportunity.
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:52:05


If it ever came down to it, i.e. in some form of legitimate tax appeal, the issue _should_ turn on who had control over the chattle such as to be able to trade it for value. If you have this, and you didn't before, you "possess" the BTC, for all intents and purposes. If you sell it for more than it cost you to get it, then you realized a gain.

Bitstamp and BTC-e are _two different exchanges_, bro. You can't buy on one and act like it only cost you the price from the other.
If you meant 290 - 305 versus 330 - 350, (arbitrage from Bitstamp to MT-Gox yesterday versus today) they are:
(305-290)/305 = ~5%
(350-330)/350 = ~6%
If you meant 290 - 320 versus 310 - 350 (arbitrage from BTC-e to MTGox) they are:
(320-290)/320 = ~9%
(350-310)/350 = ~11%
So let me know when you make that "killing" off the temporarily greater arbitrage.

To be clear, I wasn't inferring that Bitcoin is cheaper than USD generally, which is why I mentioned the transaction costs.
The "despite it being cheaper" was referring to the good purchased... I assume only quite the purist would buy stuff in BTC despite it costing _more_ at the current exchange rate.

Amen. I had my entire checking account levied for a tax bill I couldn't pay on time, and all I could think was that if I had moved it to BTC when I got paid, it would be out of reach, and (this week, at least,) worth like 10% more than when I was paid.

No, there is no universal set of definitions for generic terms in U.S. law. The U.S. has statutes and constitutional law governing what constitutes "legal tender," but again each of those (e.g. the Constitution versus a statute) needs to be construed with regard to the time it was written.
"Money" is not a term of art, and probably isn't defined in the statute this judge is construing (sorry, I'm still mobile so I can't check much beyond that).
So I guess, where do you "read that USA law does define money in a specific way?" There is simply no mechanism to do such a thing (aside from Constitutional amendment,) because Congress's later usage of the term would simply redefine it.
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:07:28
I'm not but the linked article is mostly anti-speculative nonsense.


By that definition, every company traded on a public exchange is in the midst of a "bubble." That doesn't mean he's wrong (they could all some day crash and burn,) it just means that if he's right, the term "bubble" isn't very useful for prescribing investment behavior.


Again, how is this distinguished from what "Smiling Dave" would call _legitimate_ devaluation? What he is describing here is not a "bubble bursting," but rather _any kind_ of selloff. 


You hear that? _A bubble price!_ Here's a hint: Any time someone tells you a price is "wrong," or "overvalued" or "undervalued," ask them what the _real_ price is supposed to be.
The truth is, nobody knows for sure until after the fact. The likelihood that a commodity will precipitously drop, at any point in time, is priced into that commodity. Information, and to a certain degree chaos, changes prices.
What this author is doing is no better than astrology.
Edit: It gets worse.


It sounds like this guy doesn't even know what Bitcoin is, where they come from, or how they are exchanged. Sellers cannot "set the price as high as they want," any more than the sellers of francs can.


He doesn't understand how prices are set, either. The cash needs of the sellers are only half the equation, the downside. Which maybe explains why he thinks it will crash.

Thanks for the reply. Let me ask you a question, framed a bit differently. Say the thing you want to buy is the same price in USD and the BTC equivalent of the moment. Say, $20. So, no absolute savings for using Bitcoin.
If your opinion is that "these are bitcoins we're talking about here.... in 10 years they could be worth thousands or tens of thousands each!" why wasn't that $20 already in Bitcoins? You're  _already_ out whatever gain you would have had since obtaining the $20 US, less you transaction fee. That's the incentive to spend Bitcoins. The more you have in them, the less you "didn't not gain" (intentional double negative to portray the opportunity cost) by keeping dollars.
If your response is "there is inherent risk in holding Bitcoin that I avoid by holding USD," well that sort of undercuts the original "no incentive to spend" argument quite a bit, methinks.

It's not just internet journalism, unfortunately. Ask anybody in a particular field of expertise, and they will tell you that popular journalism dumbs things down to the point of inaccuracy and obfuscation.
I had noticed that the mainstream press was excessively sloppy reporting legal news- in particular Supreme Court case holdings. They also botch the procedural posture and motion practice coverage of just about every trial they cover.
So I asked a few of my friends who went into Physics (both phd candidates at the moment) and they confirmed that popular science reporting was just as bad.
Essentially, if a reporter can't learn about it from a short wikipedia article, their reporting is going to be wrong. Get your news elsewhere.

I keep seeing this "no incentive to spend it" argument tossed around, but it really doesn't stand up to scrutiny.
If you have bitcoins and can spend them, you can always replenish your bitcoin holdings at the same time and lose nothing to deflation but the transaction cost.
If you kept dollars specifically to spend on "stuff" you _could_ have bought with bitcoin, you suffer the opportunity cost of whatever marginal gains a transfer to bitcoin had in the interim. That's a disincentive to hold dollars.
If all you hold is Bitcoin, then the incentive you have to spend is "get stuff," which is what the incentive _should_ be for spending dollars. Instead we have to buy stuff to avoid inflation.
Nobody is buying bitcoin, keeping some dollars, but then going "Oh no, I can't buy this product with Bitcoin despite it being cheaper because I don't want to lose the opportunity to make more money on Bitcoin!" If you had the extra money to buy it in dollars, you would have been better off moving it to Bitcoin and buying it that way.

This wouldn't work for _most_ people, because most people don't have a bunch of assets and money sitting around that they can hide/convert to Bitcoin. Most people get a paycheck, and pay their bills with it. Unless you can convince your employer to pay you under the table, you're still going to be on repayment plans in the bankruptcy court. Which you could do without BTC, obviously. The only difference between keeping your reserves in cash and BTC is that you make it harder to spend.

I think _if stored correctly_ is really the rub... if you're burying them underground, you're fine. I work with old real estate documents, usually in crappy ink (or sometimes even _colored pencil_ if you can believe that), on pretty damned thin paper. I can read probably 99% of typed material back to 1914 (when the first round of our documents usually started) and 95% colored pencil from the 50's on. Most of those documents were in banker's boxes, which probably got opened a dozen times or so since their storage. We digitize everything we come across, of course.
To be honest, 90%+ of the stuff _I can't read_ is because it was copied, and then copied again, and then copied again, and people probably kept throwing away (or archiving in a black hole) the originals, leaving the shittier and shittier copies.

Where a statute doesn't specifically define a term, the usual course is to afford it the term's "plain meaning," as it was understood at the time of the enactment of the statute. I suspect that is what this judge did.

This is starting to be a pretty scary thread; fortunately, the volume is pretty low so it could just be noise.
Just to throw it out there: I have worked in a prosecutor's offices, and for plaintiffs and defendants in civil suits, and on contracts. _Everybody_ thinks they're doing the right thing. I never ran into a prosecutor that thought he was enforcing an immoral or unnecessary law. I have worked in politics and I can assure you that, yes, politicians do believe a lot of the crap they spew. Not all of it, and they change when it's convenient, but in the end they generally believe that the system is doing _good_, not misappropriating wealth to their donors of choice.
This idea I keep seeing that, because there is a distinction to be made between law and legislation, all laws I disagree with aren't really laws, is ridiculous. That isn't the point Hayek makes when he points out the distinction, and it's not the distinction between common law and statutory law, either. It's just something convenient that people latch onto to rationalize behaviors they _like_ that are _illegal_.
It's great that these kids have faith in their pseudo-techno-anarchistic forms of government, and that they think they can make them work sometime in the near future. But at some point y'all need to wake up and realize that throughout the vast majority of human history, this kind of cool, super-democratic, underground-economy shit was _just not possible_. The systems of government you see throughout the world emerged from a bunch of bad people trying to get rich, and a bunch of good people doing their best, and a whole crapload of people in between who didn't give a damn. You can't take that history away, and you can't take morality out of that context.
If someone seriously thinks possessing marijuana in a state that has banned it, and enforces that ban, is not "illegal," then their notion of "law" simply reduces to "stuff I like." That's not the Western tradition of law; it's not the Eastern tradition of law; it's not the past, or present _definition_ of law. It's just made up. It's trying to co-opt a word ("legal") to give civil disobedience legitimacy. If what you were doing was worth the civil disobedience, you wouldn't need it.

I was kinda (but not totally) shocked... I use a few formulas for passwords:
1. Some leet-spoken (non-dictionary) word, with each character doubled, plus a special character at the end. e.g. HH [12 trillion years]
2. An author I read in X subject in year Y at place Z, another author I read in the same subject in year W at place V. e.g. bradburyPHS97vonnegutOSU02 [316 octillion years]
Yeah I'm never memorizing stupid symbols again.
And no, my Reddit password doesn't follow either of these. But seriously... who would want to crack a Reddit password?
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:04:07
Something else to consider, that people don't often mention:
If you've ever used a service with a similar password that has had its password lists compromised, your "obscure word" is in a dictionary that password crackers use to bust passwords.
So, e.g. I used a base word for all of my (non-vital) passwords, with variations. However, some time ago there was a compromise at Stratfor (a private intelligence provider,) for which I had an account using that base password. Because of that compromise, I knew to change _all of my passwords using that base word_, because even script-kiddie crackers know to swap 'a' for ' and append special characters and numbers, and mix case.
Not saying this is what happened, but it is entirely possible if your word was _truly_ obscure.

Long story short, those nominal values have the inherent costs of loading the currency onto the exchange, and unloading it from the exchange, priced in.
So, e.g., it takes a longer time to get money off of MTGOX, so their sell price gets inflated to reflect that.
Ultimately, the difference should be precisely the difference in the cost of doing business on each exchange- otherwise there are arbitrage opportunities created for those who would buy on the low exchanges, and sell on the high exchanges.
Think of it this way: What's stopping you from buying on bitstamp today (~290) and selling on MTGOX (~305)? You would make $15 on a $290 investment, which is not bad. Well, there are costs involved: the commissions on each exchange (I have no idea what these are,) the risk that the price will fall in the interim (which is higher when cashing out through GOX, since the duration is so long,) and the time value of the money during that interim (the interest rate you could "safely" get elsewhere). All that stuff makes your profits look a bit worse, potentially keeping you from taking advantage of the arbitrage.
If you decide it _is_ worth it, and start engaging the arbitrage en mass, then you marginally depress the price on MTGOX by selling, and raise the price on bitstamp by buying. If enough people take advantage of an existing arbitrage, it goes away. In this way, arbitrage opportunities tend to present themselves more often in smaller economies. Bitcoin is still small, but it's not so small that you're going to make a killing this way.
In fact, it's actually kind of scary just how close most of the actual exchange rates are, given the low volume of transfers. I checked the Chinese exchange yesterday, and ran the price through Google's currency converter for yuan to USD, and it was &lt; 1 yuan different from the bitstamp price. Which is pretty nuts.
