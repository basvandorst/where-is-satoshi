I remember when bitpay was announced and how easy it was for websites to start accepting bitcoin. Bitpay was pivotal in pushing the adoption of bitcoin and continued to be until this year. Unfortunately the utility of Bitcoin as a payment method no longer exists (at this moment). The only alternative right now is to implement support for an altcoin. Thank you BitPay for your loyal dedication to bitcoin, but we understand that you must move where the market takes you.

They are adapting to the protocol, by choosing to accept a different implementation of the protocol.

I think they are on-boarding some people even if they don't have the 3 referrals. I got an invite today and I only sent my referral link to like one other person. I signed up on Nov 17.

I lol'd! I figure anything I could do to help bitcoin businesses is good for everyone involved.

No, the one waiting is actually the alpha kitty. I let him on it first but he didn't seem interested. But now that the gray kitty likes it, he's probably jeleous.

Hi! I'm a long time lurker first time poster. I created an account just to say how cool I thought this was! Now when I clean the cat box I'll be "Yeah, I bought this stuff with bitcoin!"
I wonder if snapCard will someday do "in store pickup" instead of delivery.

What is bitcoin:  basically its a decentralized digital currency. No need for banks or paypal. It's the online equivalent of cold hard cash.
What is bitcoin mining:  this is the amazing innovation in cryptography that makes bitcoin actually work. Would you like some to get started? Here ya go: +$1 verify

Maybe offer a discount or coupon code for purchasing with bitcoin?

I feel, in the midst of all this market turmoil, we should remind ourselves of the real potential of bitcoin. Realize that we are just at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this amazing new technology.

Turns out that you can have it delivered to the store for now. I emailed snapCard and this is what they said:
Yanni replied:
Hey [cayspekko], thanks for the e-mail! Just put it in the notes next time, we’ll get it done. There is a little bit of manual work (while we make sure all of our technology works for the order processing side) so we’re able to do it right now. If that’s something a lot of people request for we’ll definitely do it!
We really appreciate all of the feedback!
Let us know if there’s anything that we can do better!
Best Regards, 
Yanni from snapCard!

I went ahead and bought one with bitcoin! Christmas time for my kitties!

He's not thrilled because the other kitty keeps bugging him: "My turn! My turn!"
I should have got two!

I'd say 5 - 10 minutes.  It was stuck in "processing invoice" for a while. As soon as the invoice was ready I just sent bitcoin to the invoice address and mere moments later it said it was paid for. Maybe 2 minutes later I had a tracking number.

I attempted to purchase a gift card from Gyft using their Android app and somehow was able to send bitcoin to the provided address but received no gift card. After emailing then I was impressed by their speed of response and they said they would refund my money and asked me to provide an address.  They said that it may take a couple days because bitpay was swamped but sure enough two days later I received the refund, to my surprise, in the same amount of btc. Since then the price of btc went up and I ended up earning one dollar from the refund.  In this situation I think it was more important to Gyft to cater to their customer for retention. I'm definitely impressed with them and will surely purchase from them again and recommend them to others. I think it is worth the $1 lost to them at this point. This may not be applicable to other companies' refunds but I feel all companies accepting bitcoin should strive to make this their goal to refund in bitcoin when they can. Hopefully the price of bitcoin stabilizes to the point where there isn't such a loss/gain in value over a few days.
