Well depending upon the receiver the amount its fixed. ^[1]
Pretty sure entrepreneurs can afford to pay $1-$5 per email they send ( still would be cheaper than hiring a PR agency ) also free PR email doesn't guarantee a read. This I think ( as most reputed bloggers would be mailed/paid) would get a view/eye and would be read as they are charging their time literally.

mentioned in this thread somewhere journalists/bloggers, even VCs/investors maybe. Rather anywhere where  the person receiving the email is valued for this time spent on reading. 
In real-life right in top of my head I can think of starting a service where copywriter is paid for the project he has to work on right when the first email starts.
For proof-reading some content or thesis.
As a freelancer, clients request changes in design/code/functionality and its annoying to charge them with a new invoice ( which the client delays paying ). This would be a apt way for the project upkeep.

Got it. So basically a wallet is which stores all our addresses together. Instead of being seperate independent addresses they are like a branch for a huge ass tree.

I wasn't explaining what mining does. Somoene else did explain what mining does above.
At times reading doesn't help explaining things properly, all the terms are understood but if when we see how things work it makes it easy to understand.
A watching a pool stats would give him a better idea of what mining is explained here above. Atleast I learned things that way, I started mining and watched the pool stats as I was clueless how the network in a whole works. Brings clarity to the bigger picture.

And I want to buy some coins, waiting for the dip so I could buy some.
Even if you are not using it the right way, you should have them if you like what you know about bitcoins, I am doing this just because I want to support it anyhow. Saying that any opportunity I get to spend I'll spend it.

If you followed the users' comments and what people have replied to him, he knows what BTC is, knows what mining is  and how the network works. So he surely won't be overwhelmed but would have questions about the pool now and that is obvious. But things are self-explainatory on the page.
And not everything is always clear when you just keep reading things, you need to actually see some data on how things work to get the whole idea. For many 25BTC for 1 block looks silly, but they have no idea how much work has to be done to get that 1 Block.
The mining pol stats link I gave, gives an idea what a mining pools' contribution is to the network, a rough idea on how many blocks are generated per minute after so much computation power.
Try to not underestimate rookies who are new to the network, accept them in. They might be quick learners. If he/she is not and didn't understand a damn thing about the pool, its fine atleast he has a clue and would be asking more questions what it is.

Anyways, good news. 
@_date: 2013-02-15 15:39:59
Hey, I am new too.
I did my research and this what i gathered ( precisely the reason why i love blockchain.info )
- The easiest and the safest place to store bitcoins. You load the site &gt; enter your details  And you are done. You can immediately start buying or receiving bitcoins. ( As you register and start using you would know how easy it is to access your wallet anytime you want )
- Creating and managing addresses has never been easy. And the best part, all your addresses are backed up instantly to the locations you choose which is away from the server. ( This is helpful, will get to it later )
- It is secure, you own the private key and has so many redudant security measures ( in a good way ) that you would never lose your coins. 
- Coming back to backup, you can setup a backup so that if blockchain.info goes offline or has issues you can easily import your wallet to desktop client or anywhere. This way you retain your wallet no matter what. Even if the site shuts down forever your wallet is safe with you. :)
- If you are new ( like me ) better to start with this as your wallet, desktop clients might be intimidating at start, blockchain.info just makes it simple and easily accessible. 
- They have a [paper wallet](  which is like a pre-signed cheque book that contains everything you need to send and receive money from your bitcoin wallet. Making your bitcoins access anywhere.
- It has an Android and an iOS App and works perfectly on all the browsers. 
[This page]( is very helpful to know everything.
Hope this helps.
Good luck and cya around! :)

I have a AMD Radeon HD 6850 which is on stock. The bitminter says  I just want to know if this is something possible for me to do or not before I OC or try minting regularly. This is really exciting and I just want to be a part of this before I dive in completely if possible.

Not everyone who jumped into bitcoins now should be this smart to know everything about wallets instantly. Half the people who ask me the first time have a hard time understanding the concept of wallet and bitcoin address. 
The recent surge must have many people curious. And many would have landed on the brain wallet somehow.
What makes you so pessimist about this? No one said bitcoin is easily crackable. Ofcourse its not. lol Its dumb to even think that way. you know it well.
Nothing is wrong in knowing the ins and out about something, is it? 
This doesn't convince people that bitcoin is crackable this just tell that brain wallets are crackable just like passwords. If you are not keeping a smart password you are jacked.

PayPal is having issues with the export related guidelines set up by RBI ( Reserver Bank of India ) which  is India's central banking institution, which controls the monetary policy of the Indian rupee. 
As per the guidelines by RBI, a merchant can only accept payments via online payment gateways upto $500 per transaction which involves export. So PayPal had to make that limit for every user.  
But I have no clue why they are not allowing users to use the received money. They need to withdraw it immediately, it can't be stored in the PayPal account either. PayPal gives the reason that RBI asked them to do so as many users did not declare their online earnings, spend it online itself hence did not pay any taxes for their earnings.
I still can't decide if to blame RBI or PayPal or if both are right on their part. 
@_date: 2013-02-15 22:16:08
That is one threat we face everywhere, where currency is involved. . 
There is no guarantee ever that a server can't get compromised, there is always a chance that someone wants to steal your money from your account. Just like phishing, we can be aware of it and not get cheated but we can't stop it.
People have passed through it and understand these risks when they sign up for online transactions.

The sellers who ready to sell in cash are hard to find ( reliable ones ) 
Then comes money transfer to their bank account ( real name and bank transaction to trace my btc ) 
Then comes paying their bank account via western union. The total cost of btc goes up by +10K INR than the usual rate.
The other option is paying to their bank account by going to their selected bank, these sellers have a feedback between 20% to 50%. And here too we end up paying extra.

@_date: 2013-03-12 09:08:38
I did not say its to convince people not to use it.
I quote myself


If you are smart you know how to keep a safe password, i take by your comments you are smart. But not everyone is, you could find a few ( not many ) people still cry that they lost their coins. For imbeciles, they need to be spoon-fed. For that puropse this is needed. Just like the xkcd password thing. Someone has to explain them thoroughly some things. 
using four random english words do make it insecure for a sophisticated brute force attack. 
There is nothing wrong with brain wallet, and i agree. But its good to educate people the good and the bad, and the precautions to be taken.
Edit : The way this guy did might not be the best way, as i never thougth someone would take it in a way that shows brain wallet or bitcoin is easily crackable. Its not and even if they think, they would know within few minutes ( as they know about bitcoins ) that it isn't.

I am new here, but I guess I could help you out in that.
The wallet has a private key  which you can use to load in any other wallet. This way you can still use your wallet later on if you change computer or OS. But know this, you would lose your coins if you lose that info, so be careful with that information.
But if you are worried ( you should be ) about this, then you should prefer using online wallets.
The best of those is blockchain.info
yes, its is safe and your wallet will always be yours even if the site goes down or in not live.

I'm not a currency expert but everyone says this bubble would drop after sometime and we would have a stable state.
My guesses are once the economics genuises think the bubble is over and declare a stable BTC state, that would be the time when everyone would jump on to start accepting BTCs. 
Same goes with Steam, if they need to accept BTCs for games ( for which they pay the publishers ) they need to keep trading it to make sure they don't get in a loss because of the burst bubble ( if that happens )
Steam is a vendor who has to pay its publishers, and accepting BTC as a mode of currecny would also affect its publishers. Steam might not agree to it now.

Alright. As far as I know you are right, the power usage of your usage would mainly depend on the core speed and not the ram usage much. 
I usually used to do my overclocking for games so i know how to overclock the GPU Core, core voltage, processor speed and lowering the RAM Speed so as to get better performance at stable system and good temps. But not sure how do lower the GPU RAM speed. Anyways thanks for the info, would look into that.
As of now I am first going to get a kill a watt to start my experiment. 
And you suggest a command line miner is better than using the proprietary bitminter's miner?

 I know we see the total of all addresses on top. But when a payment is done from blockchain.info does it count all the addresses as one wallet and pulls all the amount together to pay? Or do we need put everything in one address and use?
Is it a good idea to generate a lot of addresses and keep bitcoins in different addresses?
Sorry to hijack your post.

Welcome to the restricted PayPal Account! :) 
Personal payments are still available for India ( it was blocked in 2010 but restored in few weeks, it was blocked both the ways i.e. even not allowed to pay or accept personal payments also during that time they even blocked withdrawing funds electronically and only allowed us to request a cheque but later restored it )
Then in 2011,  Paypal started some bad restrictions for Indian users which is still active. The most annoying of the below mentioned restriction is that any Indian PayPal account cannot use the received payment anyhow, it has to be withdrawn. You cannot pay or buy from the receive amount.

What the report misses to say is its only prevalent in Bengaluru. It is gaining attention not popularity.
Its still really hard to buy bitcoins in India unless you live in that specific city or you are willing to provide your personal/id proof to the bitcoin payment channels.

This is what I do, I encrypt my wallet file weekly and back it up on dropbox. 
Edit : Since dropbox is on my PC, i get a notification instantly.

I sincerely hope you are not putting all your money in this and the electrical costs.
If not then, you lucky bastard. Have fun mining! It would be crazy watching how quickly you mine.
