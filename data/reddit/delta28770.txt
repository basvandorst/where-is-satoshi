@_date: 2014-04-29 02:44:50
Wow that super easy! I bet my mom could figure bitcoins out now XD
@_date: 2014-05-01 14:35:56
This is beautiful in both looks and it's workings! Also from what I know it is fantastic for privacy and overall use :D
@_date: 2014-05-10 23:58:06
Wow it feels like it was just yesterday we got 50 BTC per block
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:44:31
Seems interesting, I might as well give it a shot
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:57:14
ya i would think so as well that is waht i have been using so far 
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:54:03
Congrats man on taking the bitcoin risk! I too am wanting to buy 5-10 BTC but anyway on the mean time keep on spreading the bitcoin word!!

Welcome to the cool kids club!
@_date: 2014-05-30 01:36:01
just set my node up! i got an upload of 1.5 MB/s so people come and help the network!
@_date: 2014-04-11 22:28:34
I agree you will need a way to get BTC because the majority of people don't mine for them and buying them can be a pain
@_date: 2014-05-31 21:51:47
How much would that cost? If someone can find out and make a kickstarter project or indigogo I would love you forever &lt;3 Hahahaha I love it!
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:45:05
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:28:33
Seems very cool, keep up the work and I for sure would love to try it out
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:30:34
Congrats! I just a few days ago reached $100 witch of BTC but now with the HUGE value drop it's only worth about $70 now :(
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:41:11
I would love to contribute to one aswell if possable
@_date: 2014-08-16 02:16:45
@_date: 2014-11-14 17:55:42
Gotta love the humble bundle!

Internet bandwidth is becoming rather expensive per MB/sec and the majority of new routers and Ethernet cable are capable of massage amounts of data transfer but in reality it will never reach it's true capacity
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:10:27
Cool idea
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:31:28
im still down, only payed for about 50% of my ASIC D: hope it keeps going up AND STAYS THERE.
@_date: 2014-06-02 04:13:16
Humm i can't seem to see anything helpful anyone ells find a number to call?
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:54:14
You are amazing! I too am trying to figure out how on earth to run a node but it's epic that you are willing to give up bandwidth for bitcoin! Love you man :D
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:38:46
For online transactions what kind of verification is required to buy or sell?
@_date: 2014-04-24 00:10:59
Could seem like a great idea but when you think about it's kinda unpractical 
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:23:34
look pretty nice! for scrypt mining but what about bitcoin miners?
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:39:30
i agree, encrypting would be come a much much larger part of maby peoples lives if this were to happen though.
@_date: 2014-04-11 22:17:54
That's really nice! My hats off to you and him
@_date: 2015-08-02 04:41:15
Thank you :D
@_date: 2015-07-19 16:55:13
Apple watch buddies! :D

I'm really looking forward to Darkwallet for consumer use and anonymity, I feel that once it is stable it should give us a price boost and people start using it.
@_date: 2015-04-26 13:18:53
I am just keeping mine is a safety deposit box, probably counter productive by it keeps them safe lol
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:19:54
Well lucky me i never actually held any thing in gox so... YAY ME!
But in all reality they are only offering an intrest rate of about 0.2% so its not all that fishy seeming.
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:51:45
What AI you using or are you a sneaky bugger and made your own?
@_date: 2015-03-01 01:00:37
Umm I do... So ya
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:43:50
No i don't believe that it should ever be in a 3d party, that's the point of Bitcoin! What needs to be done is for a easy and more user friendly wallet to be created. Along with that a better form of encryption password creation considering 80% of people are going to use a password less than 12 characters. Simply people need to learn to use a paraphrase/sentence.
@_date: 2015-02-28 18:41:30
Your prices are quite high considering the cost of material for your prints is only pennies...
Trust me I have a 3d printer as well and it's a Ultimaker 2
