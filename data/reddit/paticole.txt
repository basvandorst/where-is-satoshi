Sorry I don´t get it. I have to delete the "saved" blockchain from my core wallet. I go to %appdata% and delete what?
Where can I reindex? Sorry for my questions but I am not familiar with this option I usually use electrum. Thank you for your help 
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:41:53
Yes I use the windows version. I will reindex the blockchain because I haven´t made a backup yet. Thank you for your help
400 bits
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:03:53
And how it is correct?
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:50:13
Thank you so much this is exactly what I need :)
@_date: 2014-12-25 13:58:55
haha, yes I did! ,my dad, my girlfriend and her parents got one in a picture frame. pretty cool :)
@_date: 2014-08-20 07:29:34
Very interesting
There have been downloaded just 5.058.723 Wallets so far.
I thought it would be more... That means that 5 million client and online wallets own 13 million Bitcoins. How will it work when there are several more user? Shift the decimal place? 
When the 8000 supermarkets of Argentinia introduce Bitcoin in their city the demand of Bitcoin will skyrocket
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:25:25
Thank you :) No I mean how will be there enough coins when the mass begin to use Bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:00:33
thanks, this is like  but I am not sure if these are just the core wallets or including the online wallets
@_date: 2014-09-21 04:36:24
In addition it would be cool when you tell them what do you need for using bitcoin... wallet where they could buy etc. and also that it is very easy and fast and you will be your own bank :) especially when you show them the wallet on your smartphone will be interesting :)
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:52:04
Wow, thank you. You helped me a lot. :) 
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:39:07
Very generous :) 
@_date: 2014-12-23 19:00:10
haha Merry Christmas  :)
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:56:45
of course you can download the bitcoin core wallet, multibit wallet etc. just online wallets can not be downloaded
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:05:59
How could this happen? When my friend for example knows my address and therefore knows my identitiy? 
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:17:53
Thank you ddmnyc, have a nice week :)
@_date: 2014-09-20 20:45:27
I think you mentioned a good point but $10 = 2,480,000 is not the right direction... people think omg bits/bitcoin have a hyperinflation... optimum would be 1 bits/mbit = 1 Dollar... the aim should be to have a proportion of 1:1 but i Know because of thevalue of bitcoin it isn´t possible at themoment. In future the value of bitcoin will increase and then using whole numbers would be better instead ofchanging it now
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:35:35
Ok that means: 1 Bitcoin could be divided into 1.000.000 (e.g Little Bitcoin) ?
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:12:09
hope we will be there again soon...
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:19:04
hmm... that is why a lot of people are sceptical because of their fear of sending mistakenly to a false adress; I hear that quite often...
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:28:50
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:16:10
Does changetip already work on Facebook?
@_date: 2014-12-13 10:38:37
same in @_date: 2014-12-13 17:20:02
thanks a lot, I´ve never heard it before 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:54:50
festive offer :)
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:21:47
Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-09-20 02:21:51
I have bought my first bitcoin today :) Now I have 0.02 :) 
@_date: 2014-12-29 11:32:02
Attitude of ignorance...sokrates said: "The Secret of Change Is to Focus All of Your Energy, Not on Fighting the Old, But on Building the New "
I don´t know why these people predict bitcoins demise... What about the economy right now? negative interest? higher fees? inflation? oil price? base rate? it doesn´t seems that our economy is "healthy" ;the grounding for the next crisis is already there... 
Start using bitcoin instead of hating everything new
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:43:54
Ok, thank you. I just wanted to know how many people are using bitcoin compared to 2012 and 2013...
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:06:55
Ok thanks for your help :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:01:19
The playstationplus community don´t like this idea:
@_date: 2014-09-21 04:43:32
Dogecoin is also a very fast coin ,very easy and cheap for the cryptobeginners :)  but the value will never surpass btc. Don´t forget dogecoin has an "inflation "(just for the miner) and also a high volume of 100 billion. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 21:00:07
yes of course you are right but people are lazy and everything new is bad... Aim number one is that bitcoin has to win the"fight" against banks and the adoption of governments and then I think there will be only one direction :) Your point using whole numbers is definitely the right approach
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:28:18
Thank you very much :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:34:06
I have just read an article on cointelegraph and wanted to test it but i do not have an option to pay in facebook
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:11:05
you always comment on giveaways where you can "earn" coins. Not very kind. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:09:56
Thank you. Yes I hope we will get our money back. Considering that the we paid for a miner. It was our first purchased miner which have never been delivered. Quite good start into Bitcoin Mining... I hope there is a chance to get our money back. I have just wrote an email and waiting for the answer otherwise I have to go other steps...
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:05:44
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:58:14
Maybe, but they can also have other reasons to "ban" these transaction, maybe they realized a comming trend of bitcoin and ban the competitor, they also want to work with apple pay and thats why i am sceptical...
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:01:58
yes thats why i am sceptical...
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:40:23
is it only available for ios? I HAVE TO PLAY IT! but i have an android phone ...
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:34:50
yes you´re right sorry ma fault
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:07:31
400 bits not much but to appreciate your work 
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:58:43
I love it. It´s my birthday today and I appreciate all my congrantants with a tip instead of a like :)
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:48:07
Your Welcome. It is much better than a upvote/like. Enjoy it and keep going :)
@_date: 2015-01-06 21:22:36
Hope I am right on time :) may the force be with you
@_date: 2015-01-09 11:14:06
I can´t believe it... Now, you don´t have the right to use your own money for what you want. This is disgusting but another indicator for Bitcoins success. Now they are scared!!! By the way I change my bank!
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:07:05
Thank you very much. I try to contact them. I have just wrote another email, hopefully I receive an answer. We paid for nothing and that is not fair. Never received any kind of achievement. It is disgusting ...
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:59:33
May the force be with us 
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:02:28
and also just payments in Bitcoin so far...
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:18:39
Have you ordered one ?
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:06:35
OMG It is amazing! I have already sent friends a tip. It is sooo cool :) Good job Changetip, another step for bitcoins popularity
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:57:43
Thank you. I think this will be a big step for bitcoins popularity. I am very excited to send bitcoin via facebook
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:38:46
100 bits This is exactly what I need 
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:55:11
thank you. yes you are absolutely right I have already considered both sides, you can use it as a advatage but also as a disadvantage... Now Bitcoin has an inflation in 2015 about 10 Percent in 2016 because of the halvening 5 Percent... I try to find new kind of advantages and the speculative bet is also a disadvantage because its volatile. By the way thank you very much for your answer :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:53:30
I agree. I will invest more too. In fact the price isn´t that "beautiful" but I think in 2015 it will rise again and become (the most important thing) very popular or hopefully mainstream. We get every week more and more user and that is a very good sign especially because reddit is not very popular in Europe
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:27:53
Thank you very much I need all kind of views I am writing my bachelor thesis about bitcoin and it´s true iam very fascinating about the technology and the concept. Your statements may be right but the system right now isn´t that perfect, too. In 2013 EU made a law: Before Banks get aid packages from government they HAVE to collect the money from their customer ( cyprus scenario) before they get help from governments... The interest rate of european central bank are nearby zero and many banks collecting higher fees, negative interests up to 60 cent for paying with your ATM card... And in my opinion despite from problems of (how to get a loan, and one day the deflation, and point 2 as you mentioned no customer protection) Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies could be important in future. Of course many things have to change but in a decentral world everybody could build a tool or a company or other things to makebitcoins "world" safer, easier and better
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:32:59
haha sorry
@_date: 2015-01-09 11:46:09
But that is the main reason we have banks to transfer money and acting like a intermediary. Bitcoin is not illegal in Germany and that is why they have to transfer MY money. They are getting my activity fees, charges for transaction but then don´t complete my transaction.
@_date: 2014-10-26 11:23:37
I think this is a glitch... 
@_date: 2014-12-15 00:21:20
Despite of banks purpose, what are the benefits for user? Paying for the own money? Activity fee, negative interest, 60 cent charges for using their card... it is disgusting; When I use Bitcoin about 300 times a month then it will be cheaper than the activity fee... 2015 will be a great year for bitcoin and it seems that banks are willing to help us
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:04:36
Thank you for helping bitcoin 500 bits @_date: 2015-04-20 14:35:44
Is there a link to the official statement? PS: BIG NEWS!
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:02:20
I deleted on %appdata% the blockchain file and it worked again. Thank you for your help
@_date: 2015-03-06 21:32:37
I cant access my preferences. When I try to change network settings I always have the problem that nothing happen and I have to close my wallet. Can I transfer the .dat file in another wallet not from electrum?
@_date: 2015-02-19 21:56:39
Is it already over ?
@_date: 2015-03-06 21:40:49
A red circle. It does not sync with the blockchain... I restored the wallet but nothing happened. When I try to click tools-preferences-network my wallet doesn´t react...
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:18:15
How do i reboot? I tried to restore my wallet picked up the dat.file... but the blockchain does not sync. Can I "delete" the blockchain in %appdata? thank you for your help
@_date: 2015-02-02 10:29:53
amazing :) In Germany not yet...
