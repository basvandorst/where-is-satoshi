it looks like trolling to me too, but it produced a great thread.

Your argument makes sense, but I have no idea of it is right because I am not seeing a rebuttal from the other side. I'm not seeing a rebuttal because they are banned here, that makes me skeptical.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:36:06
Did you mean to say segwit in your points instead of BU?
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:38:19
Do you mean r/btc? Or the bitcoin community as a whole?
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:19:20
Thanks for helping answer my stupid questions, at any one time there is one official release of the core client right? And it is the maintainers who decide whether proposed changes get merged into that release? It seems like they have all the power...
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:35:04
That's fine, then we are both happy, BTL would only exist for a few hours then before becoming BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:24:55
How does this fit with the idea of that "Bitcoin is defined by its reference implementation"? it seems like if people don't like what the maintainers are doing, they can go somewhere else, but they won't be working on the reference implementation anymore, and thus they won't be working on bitcoin.

I missed that, I said to myself "op thinks Wright is satoshi? Srsly?"

The difference is that this will likely take a while to settle, whereas your made up fork would fail instantly.

Yeah,I am lost, how do you get in to "the community" or is this a majority vote type thing?
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:20:39
It should be BTU and BTL or something, don't call either one BTC until we see how it all turns out.

@_date: 2017-03-22 00:43:32
I don't get it, there is a certain group of people that can decide what core is and isn't, they decide what code goes in or not. That is a group in authority, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:35:58


So it does seem like there is a group (even a single person) in charge here.

@_date: 2017-03-15 10:36:54
ETH should have become ETC and ETF (classic and fork) BTL stands for "bitcoin limited" I don't know why any other coin would use it.
Yes, everyone should call the forked coins something other than BTC, at least until it's obvious which one has won, nobody declare victory until after the competition happens.

Of course they hold them. They say a large number of good things about bitcoins, they're not gonna short them. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:30:44
Which is just the magnet working right? Since the value was expected to go up(as supply went down), it went up in advance?
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:17:36

@_date: 2017-08-27 21:01:29
Diversify among many cryptos, buy bitcoin core and bitcoin cash, and when the next fork comes, hold those coins too.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:52:46
Can't wait for the arguments against doing it and the blood bath of hurt feelings.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:17:49
This article has a really good attitude about forks. We have to try stuff if we are going to know if any of the dueling FUD is real.
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:19:06
But isn't that what a block chain fork will always look like? Is there anyway (any decentralized way) to define which is the copy and which is the original? (You can say "this is the one core supports" but that brings centralization in)
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:16:20
It says I'm not authorized to view that...
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:28:45
And as good as those really do seem to be, they are a significant change to the basic idea of bitcoin and so modifying the name as well would be warranted.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:02:18
And why doesn't core create a big block Bitcoin and a segwit Bitcoin, and see which one becomes more valuable? I don't want to switch to an altcoin because I think the network affect of bitcoin is it's value, I hate that cash involves The Imposter Satoshi, but it seems like core brought it on themselves by kicking half of the debate out of the debate.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:45:31
Do you own the word Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:34:26
I can't begin to tell weather bigger blocks are a good idea or not, I would despise fake Satoshi if I didn't pity him for being so silly. But I really do think that as a community we're carrying out the scaling debate in a terrible way why have all this animosity when we could try both things in real life?
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:36:19

@_date: 2017-11-15 23:56:10
All of those are necessary to keep it alive. (Removing segwit was part of being "Just bitcoin")  
  
Asic boost is a problem, but they say they are working on getting rid of it, and y'all say you are working on lightning network, so let's see
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:16:52
See, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about, your side should be encouraging people to accept bitcoin cash, since you are sure it won't work you shouldn't be afraid of a fair fought.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:35:12
But this is my home
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:17:36
If true that should be a huge point against its market value... Let the best bitcoin win, like I said
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:44:45
Great, then sell your cash for core, but don't play name games.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:59:23
It's not mine, but core isn't mine either. Still, it seems that if core cared about the truth they would make the best big block coin they could, and they would make the best segwit coin they could, and let the best coin win.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:44:37
If this argument, or any argument was valid then you would not be afraid of competing with Bitcoin cash on an equal playing field by calling yourselves Bitcoin core.  
  
This is actually a great argument showing that core is not bitcoin, just like a bus is not a road, it might be better than a road, but it's not a road.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:35:56
A debate held in words and not in reality is real idiocy
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:40:32
This is theft, sue them into the ground
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:57:26
But they say that you don't, and I have spent hours trying to untangle the arguments, why can't you let reality decide? If you don't like something about Cash, then make a different "bitcoin with big blocks" so we can see what really works
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:22:12
That's a good article, with a good point. but it doesn't really help us determine, whether segwit or bigger blocks is a better way to go, implementing both things and letting Market forces decide can show us which one is better. I wish we all could support both bitcoins and let reality decide.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:39:10
Decentralized, uncensorable, money. Which both sides of this debate claim to be. And I think the market will tell who is right. Claiming the sole right to a brand doesn't line up with the freedom that I thought bitcoin was about.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:10:59
Maybe, maybe not, but there is literally no way to cut through the dueling FUD except for hard cold reality. Bitcoin cash is the closest thing out there to "bitcoin with bigger blocks" and bitcoin core is "bitcoin with segwit" neither one is what bitcoin was before. But there is no need to argue, we can actually see what works best.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:19:10
Your elegant and logical rebuttal has transformed my view of this subject ^_^
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:04:21
If We Hold this competition, between core and cash on an equal playing field, we can cut through all the rhetoric and see in real life which one is better. But let's get rid of the name games, be a good sport and don't demand and unfair advantage.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:07:38
There was not consensus for segwit. In addition, saying that I already know something is a bad idea comma in place of arguing for why it's a bad idea kind of makes it seem like you don't have an argument.

@_date: 2017-11-15 23:16:53
And I'm the troll...
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:49:03
That's a great model for most kinds of development, but it breaks down when there is a stark binary choice. Should block sizes get bigger or not? At that point it's not a question of whether a piece of code is written well, it's a policy question, all the complexity of the real world comes into play. To see which answer is better both of them have to be tried in the real world. I know Craig Wright is a scam artist but that doesn't convince me that big blocks is a bad scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:42:19
Bitcoin is supposed to be an open project, it should not belong to anyone. One of the best arguments against Bitcoin cash is that it seems to belong to a small group a very questionable characters. But the fact that core claims to own Bitcoin is a good argument against them as well.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:13:24
That's a good point by the way 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:10:34
By the way, I just posted your article over to r/btc, it points out some of the really serious issues with cash. I really am trying hard to be hated by both sides just so you know.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:20:48
The competition, is to see who can become significantly more valuable than the other, say somewhere between 100 times or a thousand times the price. And for it to be valid we should all work together to make sure it's carried out in otherwise equal circumstances.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:18:53
Why do you use the word majority, and the word consensus? I thought a consensus was a super super majority, so close to unanimous that it's hard to tell the difference, was it a real consensus? Or only a majority?
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:39:02
And if that sounds like a dumb idea to you, then sell your Bitcoin cash for Bitcoin core, and see if the market ends up agreeing with you
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:55:09
As I understand it, all the other differences, was Cash removing significant changes core had made like segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:13:26
Good solid arguments, but like I keep saying if core really believed these arguments we're enough they would have the segwit versus bigger blocks fight on an even playing field.  
  
I would love it if these questionable characters we're not part of the bigger blocks team, but core said absolutely no to bigger blocks so this is who were left with.    
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:43:17
Do you have to be paid to be a shill, or do you just have to be wrong?  
  
Because I very well might be wrong, but I certainly am not getting paid.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:43:52
But such updates have happened in the past. The trouble with the majority definition is that there is no way to count votes accurately, or to define what should be a vote. But the price of one coin becoming a thousand times the other would be definitive. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:01:33
They're relying on branding rather than technical abilities. If they're scaling model was better they would not object to the world understanding Bitcoin as being temporarily split into core and cash until one emerged as clearly and drastically more valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:02:04
I might agree if it was easy to tell which team I should be on
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:30:37
I know that I know nothing
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:14:29
And you just showed us that you don't have an intelligent response to what I said
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:14:05
They are the same in every way that is only a matter of good code versus Bad Code, but they are different in terms of a policy debate.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:12:34
This is the kind of thing that I post on rbtc  I'm pushing both sides just so you know. I really do want to get to the bottom of this.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:10:51
I basically agree, it's only this silly branding issue that makes me think that core is a lot more insecure then the technical arguments would seem to say.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:11:35
It's bitcoin cash beating bitcoin core, so kinda
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:37:09
Segwit was a significant change, big blocks are too, there is no need to call either one "a different coin" let's test both ideas
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:30:53
I thought that made sense, so I checked 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:57:18
Wow, that last sentence really seems to lapse into Poe's law /self parody territory.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:09:58
So I can't really understand the middle of this article well enough to have any opinion about its validity. But it seems like it jumps from, you can run a turing machine on a blockchain, to the idea that Bitcoin might already be an a i!!
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:45:43
Bitcoin core made significant changes (segwit) the fact that they managed it without a hard fork doesn't change the fact that it was significant.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:10:01
But that's the whole point, it's supposed to be Bitcoin but with bigger blocks, that's all it was ever supposed to be.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:40:53
You don't care about the truth
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:32:42
If you search asic boost on r btc that's what it looks like
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:04:02
If my arguments were illogical you would spend more time responding to them and less time insulting me, in a way it's really a good analogy to the question at hand. If Core thought that their technology was better they would focus on competing in the market and not screaming "we are the real Bitcoin!"
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:31:36
The segwit versus bigger blocks debate should never have become a debate between two warring groups of people, the Bitcoin Community should have handled it it house by trying both things and seeing what works better. Saying that the people who bought the less significant change though, are the ones who need to change the name? That doesn't make a lot of sense. In addition, take it what should be and open source free culture type of project and saying that it should operate similar to for-profit closed source corporate Giants really makes me question if you're on the side of freedom.
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:12:28
This sounds suspiciously like you are promising the Bitcoin Community positive coverage if they fund you, I certainly won't give you any money considering the constant liberal bias of Wikipedia
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:54:33
But I think the test is getting severely lopsided by the perception that core is Bitcoin and cash is something else. Of course if you think core is better than you also think core is Bitcoin, and if you think cash is better you think cash is Bitcoin. But it really seems like core made a more significant change and cash made a less significant change, so setting aside the question of which one is better, I don't think it's fair for court to claim that they are identical with Bitcoin. On the technical grounds it actually seems like core is better, and having a loser like Craig right on their team doesn't make cash look good, but coasting on the power of the Bitcoin name, and not trying a bigger block solution themselves does make core look bad.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:34:46
I'm not a big cash supporter, I've gone back and forth trying to get convincing arguments out of either side of y'all. I really think that reality is the only way that we are going to see what the truth is.

But their argument is that they open the door to other implementations, while core only allows one.
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:21:04

I'm a little lost, Michael Jackson is not considered an expert on anything that Hitler had an opinion about, in fact I bet I like Hitler's choice of Music better than Jackson's. And I don't think either side of the scaling debate is as obviously wrong as Hitler...
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:52:31
But how many people have to abandon it before it's declared dead? BCH has ten percent or more of the value of BTC, it seems that until one is really abandoned bitcoin is split.
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:03:29
Isn't that circular reasoning? How do you define a bitcoin node?
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:07:40
No, that's not how it works, anyone who wants can buy right now, the price will fall as people get free bch and some choose to sell it.
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:47:16
But aren't you on the team that follows the core Developers, even when they change the nature of the project? It seems like the other team has the decentralized component going for them
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:02:12
Should bitcoin scale through SW/LN or through bigger blocks, does that sound right?
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:38:53
That doesn't work here because the older one wasn't abandoned by everyone.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:16:15
It would benefit me more than most anything else they might do.
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:54:36
But the other side says the same thing about btc and block stream.
I don't think the car analogy is good, since sw is a significant change and bigger blocks is a much smaller change. (Which is a better change I have no idea g
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:20:13
Because I don't know the second thing about programming
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:37:36
So no objective standard, circular reasoning all the way, the other side can do the exact same, no conclusion
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:51:30
Interesting, you'd bail on all versions of Bitcoin if Satoshi reappeared? No matter what they said or did? The price would certainly fall for a little while at least if people feared that Satoshi might move or sell their coins.
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:17:13
I'm treating both sides about the same, they say almost the exact same thing about you and no one is using arguments only assertions

@_date: 2017-10-09 19:58:14
As more people get access to the Bitcoin cash they are owed, they have the option of selling it, not all of them but some will which means the supply increases and the and the price Falls.
