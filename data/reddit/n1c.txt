There's a pretty good explanation [here]( and [here](

As I understand it, transactions are committed to the blockchain when a new block is mined that includes said transaction.
Does that mean that mining software (basically) works like this: when a new block is found, hash all the currently outstanding transactions (maybe only ones that include a fee). Take that hash and a nonce and try find the next block (hash with correct number of 0's)?
What I'm trying to get at is, do the miners stop accepting transactions they're going to try commit at the beginning of a new block hunt? Meaning the timeline would look like:
* Block found, new hash created with outstanding transactions &amp; block hunt starts.
* *Transaction A* created.
* New block found. (doesn't include our transaction)
* New hunt started that includes our *Transaction A*.
* New block found, transaction committed.

3 blocks * 25 bitcoin * $60 is good going.

Very true; but as a dev (and definitely not a designer) I fucking love Bootstrap and it's made my life infinitely more productive.

I also made a little thing for this specific purpose to cut through some of the clutter elsewhere.

This isn't far from reality.
Though there's a lot of cheap Android phones getting good penetration at the moment.
