Ok, when I see that right 10k has been defended twice this month. Technically a double bottom, but that does not count for crypto, does it? (Have to wait for the next days though)

Fuck tether. It's only an instrument for trade speculation on cryptos (w/o paying taxes).

wow... surprise! time to shred more bad news, maybe tomorrow morning, after having a nice coffee, payed by generous wall street.

What the hell did I just miss, is there a reason why rate skyrocketed in the last 2 hours?

Everday the same shit: Europe wakes up and sells, America wakes up and buys... and Asia is locked out.

true. it's impossible to win against the casino. i tried to make a meaningful sentence out of it but the right words would not come to mind. my point is that you should not neccessarily let your pants down all the way and turn your backs on your future tormentor. that would be an unpleasant feeling - either ways.

seems to me like wall street is really interested in entering bitcoin market low. running a huge media campaign against bitcoin (cnn, forbes, daily whatever), having rating agencies rate cryptos and so on. we all know that those agencies are paid for their service, likely to give bad ratings in this case to make people panic and let the price drop to a good entry level. that's what wall street does. it's about profit. hodling seems reasonable, but buying now is the only way to not letting those suckers win.

Easier to crush a barrier from a higher altitude, nothing more.

That was just before lucifer himself took care of it.

And how exactly is a US Dollar backed? It used to be pegged against gold and one could also trade it for gold any time. But that changed with Nixon. Now we have so called "free-floating" currencies, there is no reference value. Central banks can print money how they want it, also for good, like to keep volatility stable. However, with that, foreign exchange market decides about the rate. But now, tether is somehow kept at a fixed rate against dollar. I do not understand how this is possible in a crypto market where everyone more or less agreed on a free-floating system. Maybe someone could explain that part to me?

did anyone watch the superbowl yesterday? no? maybe because it's extremely boring compared to watching THIS!
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:27:13
anything from 10 mins to 10 hours. the sooner the better.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:35:27
this is like sitting on a gambling table with a lot of strangers. am i right? :D
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:47:26
Last chance to buy low, we are going for 8k..
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:19:08
Let's build on that: Take a shot every time the price moves +50 points on the 1min chart in either direction.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:07:08
Actually there is the bottom at 6666.6666, what the hell...
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:10:38
Don't forget the tax my friend. At least where I come from you pay more when you hodl less than a year.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:07:39
nope, just another one of these annoying bounces. next ground at 6,2k then at 5,8k. anything above that is meaningless.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:16:50
Not really, 7000 is not a strong support historically.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:46:36
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:02:52
Next stop 6,2k. How about cutting all the crap and going there directly.. But noo, we have all those stupid trading bots trading every swing until some whale comes along and decides what's next. Probably have to wait one or two more days before any reasonable movement. (lot's of speculation, don't pay attention to my words..)
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:09:28
True, there is a strong support, but it's at 6666 for some reason.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:10:41

And same is true for the other direction. The faster the getting up the deeper the fist in ones buttocks (unless in a short-position of course, in which case gloves are adviseable).

Low volume means that a few players can move the market big time. Now imagine these players talking to each other.. That's the beauty of unregulated markets.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:28:44
If that's not manipulation, then what? Classic spoofing scheme.
