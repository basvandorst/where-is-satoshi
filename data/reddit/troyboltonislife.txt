Yeah but I don't think anyone should put any investment in anything they aren't willing to lose. At the current time you stand to gain way more money then you stand to lose. You could lose all your money in 3 years or multiply it by x times. If we assume that the odds of each happening are equal then it makes way more sense to invest and risk the money. You can't lose more money then you put in but the ceiling for how much you can make is infinite.

Um if you think no one has explained iota and why it's special then you obviously haven't looked much into it. 
Don't spread fud if you honestly don't know what your talking about. I don't even own any of the coin but comments like yours hurt all cryptos in general, including bitcoin.

This is what I'm betting on. A dip at $4k to 2300. I'm selling right before.

Bitcoin has corrected multiple times after a huge price spike. I think denying a correction may happen is idiotic and likely just hodling dreamers. 
Do I have long term faith in bitcoin? Yes. But I can wait for a possible correction. there is a long enough period of stable growth that I would reinvest for the long term but I'd rather miss out on 20% growth than risk 50% losses.

I think the advice your gonna get here is to hold. (People might say hodl, it's a internet/crypto thing). But it really depends on what you're trying to do, sure you can try and buy and sell at the peaks and valleys but what if you mess up? How are you gonna know it's a peak or valley? People do this stuff for a living and often mess up.

I wasn't necessarily replying directly to you I was making a bunch of other arguments as well just towards many of the other people in this thread. Thanks for you're reply I think we can both agree with what you said but I think bitcoin will be a much better use if it's treated like gold in the crypto community. High price, low volatility, "safer" investment, etc. Many would disagree though.

You can also add your bank account for less fees but it took a lot longer to go through for me(not an issue since if the price goes up, you still receive them for the price you bought them for, is an issue though if the price goes down though and you would've sold them in that time though)

So shouldn't they be incentivized to mine the best coin?

Yeah but you might hold out on buying a new car if your current car works and you can buy two cars if you wait a year. Sure your example doesn't work with food but for many many purchases it does. 
And that isn't the same logic at all.

You may have been years ago but these days these guys are all phds and shit.

Time to buy. This bubbles just getting blown baby.

Exactly. That's a total concern which is why banks don't payout over inflation and why inflation never goes negative so  that people have no incentive to spend their money.

I think we'd need really good news for that. It will not be that fast if we just stop getting bad news.

Umm the comment I was replying to was talking about "Wall Street guys" and I was saying that Wall Street was filled with phd guys specifically quants. I wasn't saying basement traders were smart(and I'm now saying they are dumb now either)

Everyone says this but that's exactly the fucking point on why it's such a terrible investment. The USD is at least backed by a government with guns and power. If everything goes to shit with the USD then the hopefully the government would do *something* about it. Whatever that may be. 
Sure bitcoin attains its value by the market. Obviously it's valued pretty high right now but for what reason? You can start yelling about new international currency all you want but to be honest we all know that's not why btc is so high right now. If you took a survey of all the recent bitcoin buyers I would bet my bottom dollar the majority of them bought to cash in on a bitcoin spike.  And then what happens when they all sell? Pop! There goes the bubble. You are a goddamn idiot to believe that bitcoin is impervious to a bubble pop. 
So sure bitcoin is worth its current value because people say it's worth its current value. That's all fine and dandy and is how pretty much every commodity is traded and maintains value. But there is very little else holding bitcoins value there while other commodities all have other ways to value themselves. USD: How well the US gov is doing, Stocks: How well company is doing. Even gold is fucking shiny and a rare metal with *some* use. 
Now listen, I'm a big believer in crypto and bitcoin. But I honestly think that a bubble like this will do more harm than good for cryptocurrency. It's really starting to look like Monopoly money being made out of thin air and if/when it pops it's going to give crypto a really bad name.
