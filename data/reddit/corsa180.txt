To be fair, this is a trojan, not a virus.

You used to be able to treat trading one Pokemon card for another as a "like kind trade", meaning it was not a taxable event and you could defer capital gains tax until an actual sale of the item. But last year's tax law changes restricted like kind trades to "real property" -- basically buildings and land. So any trade of a Pokemon card for another Pokemon card that happens after Jan. 1, 2018, is a taxable event -- just as if you sold the card for cash (and pay taxes on the capital gains of that sale) then used the cash to buy the second card (which sets the basis for future capital gains/losses on the new card.)

Won't be in initial release, but from the roadmap:
"Install/uninstall apps on Ledger Nano S automatically to smoothly manage a non limited number of cryptos on one device"

I'm getting the same error on Mojave w/ node v11.6.0 and python 3.7.2
Edit: I checked requirements and realtime-talib isn't installed. It asks me to install it at launch and I say yes, but it doesn't install. I then tried to install it manually via pip3 and it throws a ton  of errors and won't install, so I'm guessing that is the problem?
Edit 2: I figured out realtime-talib, you have to install ta-lib first via homebrew, then you can install realtime-talib via pip3. So now all dependencies install, but still get the same errors from Bitvision.

Agreed. As far as kids filing taxes, in general, I think once they start making over a certain amount in income, they actually are expected to file, I don't know currently what the limits are though. I think somewhere around $3500 a year or something. Or if they have a certain level of investments and stuff.

At 0.0197 per day, it will take 50 days to generate 1 BTC, not 2 weeks.

Excellent point; getting the "brand" out there is worth a lot. I want my mom to be able to say "so what's this bitcoin I've been hearing about?" the next time I visit.

Batch three cost 75 BTC according to the Avalon website... which is about $9,975 as I type this...

Exactly, and those decimal places will be needed, because there can only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence. In order for the bitcoin economy to grow commerce will have to be done in fractions of bitcoins.

BFL_StevenM is a BFL employee and has been on  on Freenode a lot recently.

Correct, a BFL employee on IRC just confirmed that those that already ordered will be getting the original hashrate they ordered, whether that means shipping them multiple units or shipping them special units with the expected hashrate.
Also, Luke_Jr is now getting ~34 GH/s at 150 Watts after some software tweaks.

So was it unfair when the GPU miners killed the CPU miners?

Would you have sent that much cash to those folks? Treat Bitcoin like cash. If you wouldn't send that much cash to a stranger, don't send Bitcoin to them.
