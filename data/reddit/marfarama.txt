Bitcoin is not deflationary and will not be for many may years. Or is it decades? I don't know. I'm a fan of that other inflationary coin, Dogecoin, which will have a lower inflation rate than Bitcoin in about six months.

My experience with their 2FA implementation is bad.
My experience with their customer service is good.
Hope they fix 2fA soon so that it works like Coinbase and VoS.

FIXED: WE'RE HIRING! - Any talented devs out there willing to relocate to Tokyo and muck it big with Bitcoin?

What did they know and when did they know it? Reasonable questions. If the foundation knew of problems and did nothing then what is their reason to exist? Just curious. I know nothing.

It's cool. Stellar is new and a different kind of crypto thing. There's little reason for most to understand it.  It's basically a pre-mine token system where you deposit money with a local node (similar to a local bank) and you get stellars (which autocorrects to stealers on my computer).  You can then transfer money immediately on a distributed network and change it at the same time. For instance you can send $100 to somebody in Japan and have the network automatically convert it to Yen. It's interesting. It's an open-source version of the Ripple network.
