That's a damn good answer!
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:26:07
Yes, that's what they are doing with every update they install on their node. And forks can happen if some agree and some don't and use different versions.

Did you send your reply to the paper as a readers letter?
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:38:18
If the whole world is ruled by the same set of people, do you think they will leave you in peace just because you are in LEO or on international waters? Strange delusions.

So, the fiat money transaction also goes through escrow? 
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:40:25
Does it have a built-in escrow? Or how are transactions made safe? 
@_date: 2018-09-11 06:12:57
I just finally sold all my bcash from the fork (never bought any). Should have done it long ago. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:54:40
Good point! 
@_date: 2018-08-01 11:37:33
Not erasing. Crypto currencies ARE the evolution. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:42:00
Me too! 
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:27:15
HODLers are conspiracy theorists wat? 
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:29:32
I like your enthusiasm, but I've never seen a BTC transaction as fast as a credit card payment. We're not quite there yet. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:06:25
I actually loled :D
@_date: 2019-11-12 19:38:41
As we all know, poor people routinely bomb others.
Your point being?
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:35:50
Uhm, no, not if you'd implement a sensible social system. Like Switzerland or Sweden, taking some of the burden off the poor and socially distribute the cost of healthcare etc. Also, affordable education for everyone.
@_date: 2019-11-12 19:41:59
I think it does. Everyone pays the same amount, but gets treatment paid for, whatever problems they have. There are some additional layers like more luxury in hospitals or alternative medicine.
And it's a mandatory, state enforced insurance.
@_date: 2019-03-29 06:11:42
WTF is $BTC? 
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:01:11
There's many things you can't control with healthy living. So fuck those people who just have bad luck in the genetic lottery or are worked sick by their employers. Yeah, that sounds like about right.
And socialized doesn't mean free, don't know where you got that. It means everyone helps paying for everyones burden. You know, like a community.
@_date: 2018-10-28 10:27:52
Sooo, good luck with that. They couldn't even regulate music and movie piracy. 
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:14:09
I saw a girl with a crypto coins shirt in a tattoo shop once.
@_date: 2019-11-07 06:42:20
Wait for what? Even if BTC would become the mainstream currency and you never have to exchange for fiat, do you think they will not be interested where that money that you're spending comes from?
@_date: 2019-11-07 07:02:43
They see you paying rent and buying food, etc. Where does the money come from? 
If BTC is mainstream currency, you will pay other people for goods and services. Do you think all of them will help you hide from the IRS?
Not to mention the public ledger.
@_date: 2018-10-24 06:35:35
Have you heard of windows and alt+tab? 
@_date: 2018-10-28 16:22:57
And piracy has somehow been affected by that? 
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:41:07
These are all examples of magic or voodoo divining of the future. Which is nonense of course. 
@_date: 2019-11-12 19:49:51
This is a capitalist opinion piece. The free market dogma is just not always right. 
The US has far worse healthcare than Sweden, Switzerland or France.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:01:06
Also, I'm casting some bone sticks and rubbing my finger in coffee grounds or chicken innards. 
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:56:53
If you pay only 5% of your income for healthcare, that doesn't include anything really serious that would cost all of your savings and those of yours family, does it?
Sure, fuck those people who actually need extensive treatment, as long as you get to pay as little as possible.
Also, going to the hospital for an ingrown toenail and getting a 50'000 price tag on that, brought to you by the oh so great US healthcare system.
@_date: 2019-11-13 05:44:34
Just a matter of ideology, then. Healthcare in Switzerland is better and cheaper than the uber capitalist version of the US. A sane mix of private industry and state governance is best.

Wow, he can't even write properly. Is he related to Trump? 
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:12:50
Wow, you're a charming one. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:21:04
Nooo, this is completely backwards. 
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:37:09
What is this.
@_date: 2019-10-31 07:14:10
Why would that do anything to the trust in blockchain?
And why would that make one an assassination target?

Just you wait. It has already happened.

SciFi authors conjuring up our progress and our future by painting pictures in the imagination of capable people. I love this shit. 
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:52:44
You are right. I was wrong. Sorry.
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:21:37
I'm thinking/hoping that technophile people who got into bitcoin early and become ultra rich, will not continue in the same tradition as the banks who built and undermined capitalism.
@_date: 2019-02-05 16:22:40
Sry. I just read Cypherpunks and got a bit carried away by enthusiasm :) Also, I first read about crypto currencies in the SciFi novel Cryptonomicon back in 98. Guess that also colored my perspective. 
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:22:07
If you work for your customers completely anonymously, then yes.
@_date: 2019-12-06 17:05:18
Yes, that's what long and short means. No, it doesn't automatically relate to margin trading. That may change from user to user. The terms are old trader lingo, from before margin and way before crypto trading.
Using local bitcoins on ATM is way to slow for meaningful day/swing trading. It's OK for holding though.
@_date: 2019-12-01 08:19:40
How exactly?
@_date: 2019-12-30 08:33:18
And what does that change in regards to decentralized crypto currencies?
@_date: 2019-12-06 05:30:15
Going long does not necessarily mean using margin, if I'm not mistaken.
How DO you trade without exchanges, is the question? We need DEX with higher volume of course.
@_date: 2019-04-18 16:38:11
We don't need investment bull runs. We need adoption.
@_date: 2019-12-06 17:06:43
Nope he's right, traditionally shorting is exiting your position because you expect a drop. Then buy again cheaper.
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:10:02
Or you just buy BTC with your salary payment. Much easier, no?
@_date: 2019-12-07 08:06:01
You replied to a comment asking about crypto trading. Nobody in the crypto space expects trading to mean "only buying and selling in a basic sense".
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:09:45
You're making it look like Daenerys was melting the wall with one of her dragons? 
@_date: 2018-11-02 20:06:47
This is hilarious ������
@_date: 2018-11-09 04:18:50
Yeah and then there's this idiot Peter Schiff spouting nonense like buying gold on a website and they'll keep it in a safe and you'll pay other people with it. He calls that "owning" and thinks it's better than crypto. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:24:18
But...  Why? It's so ironic. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:32:56
Perhaps that is what happened to Roger Ver. And then it went to his head. And then he lost his biscuits. And now see where we're at. ;P 
@_date: 2019-09-18 14:43:05
Consider it done.
@_date: 2019-09-14 17:53:18
So extremely lame.
@_date: 2019-09-06 05:43:56
Perfect example of ignoring everything else and just see what you want to see. Watch the movie PI sometime.
@_date: 2019-09-18 14:41:28
The innocent working class could buy crypto though. See Venezuela.
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:45:35
Oh but they will, if their holdings are at risk. And if they don't, tough luck.

If only he had kept and preserved that Pizza, it would probably be worth millions now (to crypto crazies anyhow).
