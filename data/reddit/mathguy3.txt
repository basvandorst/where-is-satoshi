You don't. Bitcoin will make a lot of new things possible, and generally make people freer. Not today, not tomorrow, probably not this year. There's nothing you need to do (likely nothing you can do, unless you're a talented computer programmer), this will happen on its own.
Noteworthy: you aren't exchanging anything for numbers. Just because Bitcoin uses math doesn't mean every bitcoin is a number. You're exchanging goods for a record in the public ledger saying you own ___ bitcoins.

You don't *have* to do anything. Bitcoin is not mature enough to solve your problems at this point in time, and so you have the option not to buy any bitcoins.
It's *incredibly* different from fiat currencies. For one, the government can print fiat currency whenever it wants more money (and they do so quite regularly). Bitcoin cannot be printed or counterfeited by anyone for any reason.
For another, bitcoins can be sent anywhere on the planet (anywhere that accepts them, that is) almost for free and without needing a trusted third party. Trusted third parties are readily available with fiat currency (Paypal, Visa, Western Union, etc.) but they're expensive.

What are you teaching? I'm a math professor and I recently did a crypto unit in one of my classes. Be prepared: there is a lot to learn.
Cool uses for bitcoin: basically all of the stuff you can use cash for (except via buying giftcards). Most of the really great advances just aren't here yet.
Way to get bitcoin w/o going through an exchange: localbitcoins.com, or Mycelium on Android.

Although I teach card counting in a lot of my math classes, most teachers are going to be a little bit hesitant about explaining Silk Road / gambling / etc. to their students. We like to keep our jobs.

I ran into that as well. I even emailed someone at Ubuntu about it. No response.

Wait, so you're arguing that the internet is not a success? Seriously? I'm not even sure what to say to that...


Then do the math and make us all believers. I double dare you.
