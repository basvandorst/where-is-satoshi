What would you recommend for me to mine? I'm new to mining but want to give it a shot for experience and to gain profit if possible. I have a 2-SLI GTX980 setup and i7 4790k. Thanks in advance!

When it gains/loses value by a few thousand dollars in a short period of time, that sounds by definition volatile haha...

Sure thing, just be aware of the fees that Coinbase charges. I think it's around $3 a transaction if I'm not mistaken.

Thanks a lot, this helped!

This makes a lot of sense thank you so much!

The value will change based off Bitcoin's value. So if you put in a certain amount and bitcoin value increases, you get the gains.

What do you mean? When I buy 1 BTC for example, and the price goes up, the value in my coinbase goes up. So I can sell my 1 BTC and I'll get the gains of whatever it was between the price of original purchase and whatever it is at now. In other words, whatever I hold, that value increases.

Math is my biggest weakness but that doesn't mean I should stop trying. Ive done IT work for a bank and although they are good with math, I can find it crazy how people can't use their web browser properly. Quit judging and being a stereotypical dick.

I was looking at it all wrong. I learned in order for me to be on track with what I see is if I owned an entire Bitcoin.
