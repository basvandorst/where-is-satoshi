Individual transfers of big amounts is very hard with the current system. 17$ is a small price to pay. 
You can send 100k or 1mil (-100$) to the opposite side of the planet and no one will object  to that or question its validity.

So to be able to transfer any $ amount without having to go through bank approval , clearance etc isn't enough?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:59:10
Wtf??? You can send 17$ without extensive bank checks + no big delays. Try doing 17k with the current banking system. 
So no...17$ is not the same as 17,000$

Guys...do you consider the possibility that  crypto sell offs may be enhanced by government aggressive selling of confiscated coins? There is very little transparency of what they do with the confiscated btc 
+ remember Bulgarian gov confiscating 200k btc in May 2017 and then suddenly in June there was a huge mkt crash?
+ how is it possible that gold and silver are falling like bricks the last 2 years despite brexit, trade wars etc?

 Now the most important is this-&gt; 
Goldman’s most important clients are hedge funds thus speculators.
Let’s say a speculator wants exposure on BTC and doesn’t have the regulatory green flag to trade it. But it can trade fwds with Goldman, 
The speculator now is happy, but what about Goldman? Suddenly Goldman has exposure to BTC up movements. How do you hedge if you are Goldman , given that no asset correlates with BTC so you have no proxies???
The only way to nullify the risk and get the spread, is to buy BTC for yourself. Then if btc goes up, you don’t worry, if it goes down, you lose on your btc position but you win on the forward.
Edit: it may hedge with centrally cleared futures in the beginning, but then again asymetries are very likely to arise and spreads between futures and asset may diverge so much that it would be cheaper to hedge with the underlying

Negative correlation is also good (even better ) for a diversified portfolio. You lower your risk even more than with 0 correlation while maintaining the asset expected returns. It’s like portfolio management 101

Central institutions help in quick resolution,
No doubt about that. The point of the whole crypto endeavour though is the questioning of those institutions when they become too powerful/bigtofail/gethacked etc. 
It’s still very early but the ability to send 1$ of value from A -&gt; B without knowing B, and without him knowing A, and no one needing a central party approval, licence, bank account and 0 risk of reversal is very powerful. 
I don’t have all the answers with respect to all potential issues that may appear, but intuitively it allows for larger flows of value and innovation  without central party trust bottlenecks &amp; concerns.

You can have a smart contract as an escrow. No need to trust any central institution.

Back then it was highly more risky. It was bitcoin on its own with very little coverage. 
There is no reason at all that this mkt will stagnate for 2 years. 
Current mkt state is temporary till at most 3-4 more months. Institutions are getting ready to buy as foundations for institutional holdings are being set up, retail investors are already broke, and possibly we see some cryptohedge fund liquidation at the moment.

@_date: 2018-02-13 12:31:26
Let’s say you start with initial wealth w0.
You end up with wealth w1.
No matter how many trades you do, your final tax liability can not exceed :
TaxRate * ( w1-w0).
This is an upper bound (and can be proven if you break down the case where you pay tax on every sell)
Thus why not just pay the above quantity and get over with all the details? Worst case scenario, auditors will check all trade history and in the end they won’t be able to find any tax liability since you paid the upper bound.

People don’t innovate in order to make money.  Money acts as a bad incentive and we may need to rethink of what truly drives human progress.
Actually it is rare to have innovation born from the desire to make money. 
Most innovation comes from pure curiosity. Computers, radios, TVs, spaceships , dynamite, occupying mars...all of these were born primarily from curiosity. Their evolution also was a result of curiosity...money motives can act as a temporary accelerator / boost but it’s not more than that. Just an accelerator

Governments and central banks are like alcoholics. 
A bit of alcohol here and there (lending / credit) is good for the system and adds color. 
But drink too much (because it’s nice) and then you get a hangover (crisis)
How does one become an alcoholic? It’s the moment he realizes that if he drinks one shot of alcohol in the morning, he can get rid of the negative consequences of hangover magically ! 
Hangover is your body saying that you have poisoned yourself. But drink one more drink and boom, push the consequences into the future.
Deflation, unemployment etc during a crisis should be accepted as a remedy period not feared as the ultimate evil, it just shows that we partied more than we should have. 
If banks and govs keep injecting drugs (quantitative easing / illusionary low interest rates/cost of borrowing ) to keep the party going, who knows where this will end up (more income unequality/depression/uprisings are possible outcomes)...

It means that if you place any arbitrary boundaries on bitcoin prices, say p1=0and p2=2 mil, and you place a stoppage criterion that if you touch the barrier you stop, then with probability 1, as time goes to infinity, you will hit one of the 2 barriers. 
It is impossible to stay within a range and not touch the barriers in the long run. If you withdraw the stoppage criterion and you disallow negative prices, then with probability 1 you will touch both barriers. Worth to check more on google on gamblers ruin

It’s simple math. Check gambler’s ruin for proof, the probability of staying in range in the long run for stochastic processes is 0. You will hit a barrier with probability 1
