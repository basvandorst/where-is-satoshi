Megaupload was huge, they have said that they still have the user database and will reinstate all users. That's around 100 million accounts I believe. 100 million emails going out about new Megaupload (familiar) and Bitcoin, pretty big exposure. How many of these new users then go on to buy a small amount of Bitcoin just to try it out. The price would fly up I'm sure
I do, however, have concerns about his bitcache project he claims will solve Bitcoin scalability. 
Which ever side of the line he's on he is a very smart guy and a very good showman/hypeman with a large audience. It's a shame that historically his hype has been used to line his pockets and then burn the project.
Just my 0.0000002

Circle does gbp to Btc and back. I'm in UK and buy regularly from there with a debit card and no worries

From what I can gather due to various tweets it is likely Megaupload/bitcache is going to be similar to  (which is open source) as the main guy is involved:

Except he is. He directly says its the bitcoin chain they are using in another tweet.

Guy who works for Microsoft saying there’s some news coming which will be positive for bitcoin and knock coinbase down a peg. Or that’s what I read into it

Thanks for your input, Roger.

Youre very cool, look out for some coins headed your way as a (micro) thanks

Its not blockchain or bitcoin related.
Looks like they have copied the idea minus the currency aspect

This is how we get widespread adoption, making it easy for kids and second nature so that it's common for them and they grow up using it.
Linking to things of interest and get them using it. Micro transactions for game content, Loading up you child's phone wallet with some cash when they need it in an instant

I was doing so well. Until today..
Just had to fork over 2.24btc to get a key for some ransomware (long story, Client not changing backup tapes. Hope to recover from them)

Thanks so much, really appreciate it. 
To be honest the actual recovery process really solidified how important and easy to use Bitcoin really is.
You are presented with a webpage which states an amount and an address to send to, you send the funds and the file starts downloading. 
Say what you will about cryptolocker hackers, they are true to their word and provide the goods upon payment. If only it was a micro transaction

Im pretty sure means he had 21 bitcoins and now has 16 bitcoins hence is out of the 21 club
@_date: 2017-03-22 07:19:38
They want to buy all the bitcoins they can from the users is how I read it
@_date: 2017-02-12 13:14:30
That has nothing to do with it. The bitcoins werent encrypted, they are saying they have had to send a criminal 5btc to get a recovery key to decrypt files

Its Miners that need to support in order to trigger, not just normal nodes as I understand it. As far as I know we dont have a measure of how many miners are signalling support at the moment

The same can be said for bandwidth speeds. Dial up -&gt; adsl -&gt; fibre to the cab/home. Put what most people have now against what you had five years ago
4 and 5g wireless is the next big push that will double or triple access speeds for more people in all areas (urban and rural) and it won't stop there.
To put a limit on block size because bandwidth will be an issue in the future is crazy talk

If I'm not mistaken places like coinbase although the hq is in the U.S. Is actually a UK company, sure I read that recently and a host of other big Bitcoin names too

Im, as of today, at 4.7. Im heading for 10 but doubt I will go any further. Any extra I get will be for purchasing and using. Happy for you!
