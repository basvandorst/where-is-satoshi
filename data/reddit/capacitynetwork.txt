1.8 BTC in channel balance. Running loss over 2,000,000 excluding Time and Server cost
I do not balance channels, doing this just unbalance other people and cost me more money.

Balancing channel, unless you have 2 to same node, is not good.
Some node like custodial wallet send more. Some node like shop receive more. If you fight direction of flow through network you unbalance other people, and usually block used channel for users.
I do not rebalance now. I do make more larger channel when they need.

I rough guess for one day
* over 25,000 under 250,000 transaction
* over 50 BTC under 500 BTC payment

No autopilot. Lot of research on \`describegraph\`, lot of trial and error, lot of cost open and close channel to try.

Big risk yes. I pay for enterprise server with backup and lots of hard disk in raid array, but this beta software, it has bugs.

!lntip 15000 for comment:  I guess a liquidity provider will have to provide some minimum guaranteed level of service to stay in business.
You are correct.

pay via invoice complete

This exponentially decreases the cost (time and satoshi) of running and maintaining lightning node.

I would pay for a second and third turn not the first. Good !lntip 500

Yes this is enough working hours, but factor in real time to download the blockchain and synchronize lightning daemon.
An issue is you have not included any time to use, setup, or learn what you are doing.
* Install Ubuntu Linux on VM, setup SSH, firewalls, basic dependencies: 2h
* Follow tutorial to install bitcoin: 2h
* Wait for btc chain sync: 12-36h
* Follow tutorial to install lightning daemons: 2h
* Wait for lnd chain to sync: 1-4h
* Setup services/automate backup: 2h
* Open channels, learn, use, configure: 12-16h
* Documentation: 4h?
* Time spent researching, estimating, making an offer/little presentation of the project: 4h?
