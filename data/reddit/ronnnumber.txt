You're not exchanging them, you're just moving them from the exchange to your own wallet. Keeping bitcoin sitting on some website somewhere (i.e. on an exchange) is deemed risky because you have to trust the operator of the exchange not to lose, mismanage, freeze or steal your bitcoin--a type of counterparty risk bitcoin itself is designed to eliminate. By moving the Bitcoin to your own wallet, you can be sure it us under your control since you and only you have the private key.

You can set up a discrete "account" for each keypair. In Mycelium go to "accounts" tab. Touch the key+ symbol. Hit "advanced". Hit "generate new random key". Do this 3 times and you are done.
Note: these keys have yielded static addresses not derived deterministically. What this means is you will have to write down a special separate backup for each, which are obtainable from the app, because your HD seed will not restore them. The other thing to consider is use of static receiving addresses can be a privacy issue for both sender and receiver.
Once you have this set up, your addresses will appear under the "other accounts" tab and you can toggle between them and spend/receive from there.

The easy way is: recipient sends you their BTC address QR code. You feed fiat into the ATM on your end. When you're done inputting $ and the machine asks for your QR, you show recipient's. Recipient now has the bitcoin. He/she cashes out at an ATM on their end. In most cases not a very cheap way to do it, but it's very easy. 
One thing to consider is: ATMs dispense bills in nicely rounded denominations: 20, 50, 100. This means recipient will wind up holding *some* residual BTC.

Not an accountant here, but I was told by my accountant that crypto to crypto is also a taxable event. So if, I dont know, your ETH explodes skywards and you decide to move it into BTC, you have realized a massive gain just swapping it for BTC. There are special cases sometimes where in-kind swaps of certain assets are not taxable but this is unlikely to apply in the case of crypto. Curious about your opinion on this.

That was two days ago and I have heard nothing since and I'm starting to go ape shit while trying to remain calm.

says "Transaction Failed. Are you sure you are connected to the internet?"
Is Hive sure their wallet works? What have they done to warn their users about this major fail?

No it just means debt forgiveness. Once in a while the best thing to do is take a writedown on a risk you probably shouldn't have taken. What's the point of imposing unsustainable hardship on your debtors i.e. the Greece situation. Their economy has shrunk 25 percent directly as a result of this failed austerity policy, hardly a recipe for ever getting paid back. The troika insistence that Greece should take out yet more loans from the IMF so they can meet payments to the IMF--it's a joke. I don't know why people think this is some kind of call for more government spending. Rather it's a critique of the total failure of neoliberalism to address real world problems.

Banks’ old IT systems buckle under strain
Igor Feitoza, a Brazilian-born entrepreneur, left an angry message on his bank’s Facebook page this week.
“I want to see if you guys will pay my overdue bills and my employees as I can’t access my money which I . . . deposited last Friday to pay them,” he wrote following a “ridiculous” three hours spent at the bank.
Mr Feitoza is not one of the many frustrated Royal Bank of Scotland customers hit by the latest technology failure this week. He is a client of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country’s biggest bank by market capitalisation, which had its reputation as one of the most digitally advanced lenders tarnished by an outage in its payment and online systems late last week.
As well as provoking outbursts on social media, the technology glitches at RBS, which caused some 600,000 payments and direct debits to go missing, and CBA underline how the world’s biggest banks are often failing to get to grips with the growing demands being placed on their IT platforms.
Banks spent about $188bn on IT last year and that figure is expected to grow at close to 5 per cent a year, taking it above $200bn by next year, according to Celent, the research company.
Many banks, such as RBS, are plagued by computer systems that have been built up over several decades through acquisitions and new product launches to form a costly and complex patchwork of systems.
“A lot of these programmes get three-quarters done,” says a senior technology executive at one of the largest US banks. “It’s one of these technical debt problems that builds up over the course of time. If you have one thing happen it might cause the whole thing to fall down.”
The cost of maintaining these often ageing and unwieldy systems eats up three-quarters of banks’ IT spending, according to Celent. That leaves only a quarter to spend on innovations to keep up with the rapidly emerging threat from the many technology groups and start-ups trying to steal market share in areas such as payments.
“For a sector that spends significantly more on technology than most other sectors in the world, it is the least innovative, so there is a paradox here,” says Bill Michael, head of financial services in Europe at KPMG.
As many banks struggle in the post-financial crisis environment to generate returns above their cost of capital, these spiralling costs and inefficiencies are becoming increasingly unacceptable to managers and shareholders.
“The banks are all putting their hands up and saying: ‘Help, I no longer want to do this alone any more — can someone else come and help, whether that be a cloud services provider or a partnership with a start-up’,” says Mr Michael.
RBS, which last year paid a record fine to regulators for a bigger systems outage in 2012, hoped to solve its problems by replacing its core processing engine at a cost of £750m. But in a recent interview, its chief executive Ross McEwan conceded there was still a big job to reduce the number of systems and applications at RBS from more than 3,000.
Andrea Orcel, global head of UBS’s investment bank, says: “The challenge for most banks is that they are not technologists … As technology continues to evolve at a fast pace, becoming ever more critical to their business, they are having to navigate a space that is both highly complex, and does not play to their core competencies.”
Asian banks spend more than Europeans or US rivals on IT; their spending is growing faster; and more of their IT dollars are going on new projects than on maintenance.
However, they are hardly glitch-free. In January, a problem in the system linking accounts at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country’s largest lender, with securities brokerages, disrupted Rmb4.9bn in fund transfers, affecting nearly 55,000 customers at 90 brokerages.
As regulators make ever growing demands on banks to provide them with vast amounts of data for everything from stress tests to anti-money laundering checks, banks are racing to keep their systems up to speed.
Deutsche Bank insiders blamed its failure in this year’s US stress test on years of under-investment in IT that made it unable to meet US regulators’ demands.
Concern is growing about cyber security after a string of high profile hacking attacks, such as last year’s theft of data on 76m customers from computer systems at JPMorgan Chase.
Executives say this focus on cyber security is a catalyst for change, pushing banks to simplify and upgrade their IT systems. “Making something secure requires it to be consistent and clean and up to date and well managed,” says the US tech executive.
James O’Neill, senior analyst at Celent, predicts that within a decade most big banks will have switched from using costly mainframe computers for overnight processing of customer data to using much more flexible cloud-based services.
If nothing else, the shortage of developers trained in the Cobol programming language that drives most bank mainframes will force them to make the switch. Australia’s CBA has moved to a cloud-based system, while Deutsche recently outsourced many of its applications to a cloud provider.
“The story about legacy systems impeding innovation is a bit oversold,” says Mr O’Neill. “I’m not saying they will go on for ever, but they have done a pretty decent job of supplying new products and services.”
Like many sectors, however, banks are realising the need to harness the power of “big data” to offer better digital services to their customers.
Mr Michael at KPMG says his banking clients know the stakes are high. “They have seen what technology has done to music and home shopping and so far they have been relatively slow to adapt — but the longer they wait the harder it will get.”

BBVA tackles the US via digital banking
 
Francisco González, the former software engineer who is now chief executive of Spain’s BBVA, is scathing about the messy compromises that many banks make to patch their IT systems together.
“Most of the banks have started at the rooftop. How did they manage to work without the foundations and the floors? Just middleware — more spaghetti on the spaghetti.” he says in an interview with the Financial Times.
After rounds of acquisitions, many large retail and commercial banks are tangled up in legacy systems which run the risk of breaking or presenting opportunities for intruders to gain access.
At the same time, banks are building on more features because they need to present an attractive digital product to consumers. At the same time, financial technology start-ups are nibbling away at the business, presenting what Mr González asserts is an existential challenge for lenders.
“My view is that many of them won’t make it,” he says. “They don’t know that. That is my opinion. We are ahead of the pack and we aspire to be the disrupter, coming from the conventional world, the banking sector.”
BBVA has spent more than €850m annually on technology for the past few years, including the painful and expensive decision to replace legacy systems — Mr Gonzalez’s loathed spaghetti — with a modern data centre.
The chief executive now feels ready to tackle the US, where he has the country’s 33rd largest bank by assets, branded BBVA Compass, which last year acquired Simple, a digital bank. The bank’s active Silicon Valley ventures arm has also invested in Coinbase, a bitcoin platform.
“For us the US is the most promising market,” he says. “It’s the largest market in the world, one of the most digital societies in the world, and the retail banking system is quite a bit elementary.”
“The gap has to be filled by someone and we want to be one of the guys. BBVA Compass is the platform. We need to be a digital challenger in the States,” he says. “We have installed all the platforms, and we can connect start-ups to it. BBVA Compass will roll out a complete universal bank in the digital world.”

Not bad--way better than getting a cash advance on a credit card which is probably what I would have done in the past. So yeah there are reasons to actually use it -- like when you need to, for example.

Just a caveat--make sure the browser you use is not Safari 6.0.x. A bug was discovered that makes decrypting bip38 private keys made with that Safari flavor dependant on using only that same browser. This could turn into a big freakout/problem when it comes time to sweep the key(s).
For peace of mind, test out the whole process using only a small amount of btc first. Decrypt using a different browser, then sweep the key just to prove to yourself it works.

These brands increasingly associating with bitcoin are eventually going to erase the effect a lot of the really horrible press we've seen in 2014 has had on popular impressions of this technology. It's gonna be a while though. MT Gox was a real debacle and we still have to endure the inevitable onslaught of year-end bitcoin obituaries from media watchers who don't look much further than price. Through it all, I still care about bitcoin because of the amazing energy going into it, and all the innovations we've seen in such a short time, and I look forward to what 2015 will bring.

In the event of bank failure, there is a bail-in mechanism for recapitalizing systemically important (i.e. too big to fail) banks that extends to unsecured creditors (that's you, the depositor, and your savings account). In effect, they can take at least a portion of your money with no warning to prop up the banks.
This was quietly formalized by the Financial Stability Board in recent years and adopted in the policies of G20 countries towards their own respective banking systems. 
Most people weren't even aware of this until the banking crisis in Cyprus in the spring of 2013, when a bail-in was implemented, among other measures, to stop a meltdown.
A lot of people think that the resulting jitters, especially through the Eurozone periphery, is what triggered the massive 8X price run up of bitcoin in April of that year. But it's not clear what the evidence is for that.
I'm not an expert, and could be wrong, but that's my understanding.

Bitcoin does rise, but it also falls. Try predicting the movement for the next five minutes. Can't really do it. Same applies for any other timespan. That being said, buying and holding for a prolonged period (2 years) has worked out for me. Sold some, bought some more...No idea what the next two years will do but it's fun to be involved in this. It's fascinating from so many angles--economics, game theory, technology, business and industry--there's so much more to it than the price (although of course price matters).
Another thing to consider: buying bitcoin is certainly risky, but there can also be risk in doing nothing. Where I am, the fiat currency has dropped ~13 percent against the USD since I got into bitcoin, so simply holding it would have involved its own risks. Getting into bitcoin made me realize stuff like that.

What you said reminds me of the early days of the web. When I first saw the web it was interesting but definitely not my favorite thing compared to, say, Gopher and Usenet. But when the implementations got a bit better it started to really capture my attention, and before I knew it I was authoring websites for other people--just learning as I was going since I was not all that sophisticated with computers. I would invite people over just to "show them the web" because I had gotten so into it.
20 + years on, I have found myself saying "I was there" just like you said. If there is any difference between that moment and now, at least for me, it's that back then I never really grasped the totally transformative effect the web would wind up having. With the blockchain, I got the memo right off the bat.

I was also in SF last week and had to sell bitcoin for cash when I ran out of money. In my case it was because a prepaid Visa card I had loaded up with about 1000 bucks did not work in a single ATM there. I could use it in restaurants and stores but cash was a no go. Was VERY glad I had brought a bitcoin backup.

The first thing that appealed to me about bitcoin was this idea you could buy/build a machine that would actually make money. I looked into BFL and decided waiting ages and ages for an ASIC didn't exactly seem like a good idea since the market and difficulty were shifting so rapidly.

I have one of those. You can withdraw CAD to the card for $1.50 and it happens in less than 24 hours. I'm not sure but I think there's a bunch of hidden fees though on the card. So you might want to think hard about if you really want/need to transact this way. The interesting thing is it's like  a "bank card" but there's actually no bank involved. The bank transfer withdrawals from Virtex are more expensive on a per basis ($6) and in my experience they also happen in about a day, maybe 2.
One thing to warn OP which goes for every exchange: don't leave your money there longer than you have to!

Sorry I didn't make that clear. I don't want my money back, I want to make the booking. There was a mishap when the recipient failed to confirm within 24 hours which sets in motion a reversal of the credit card authorization. Neither I nor the recipient wanted to cancel and now the money is in limbo. The problem stems from this ill-advised use of cc authorizations as a kind of escrow. That would be OK if the reversals were instant, but they're not. 
I guess my point is better to have non-reversibility coupled with smart money features of bitcoin which could do better escrow than have reversibility a la credit cards which is cumbersome if not broken.

"The bizarre thing about the concept of ‘exit to the internet’ is that the internet is a technology premised on massive state and corporate investment in physical infrastructure, fibre optic cables laid under seabeds, mass production of computers from low-wage workers in the East, and mass affluence in Western nations. If you are in the position to be having dreams of technological escape, you are probably not in a position to be exiting mainstream society. You are mainstream society."

A lot of these ATMs say 1 BTC=$612 or whatever and people just ducking into the newsstand to buy a pack of gum look at that and say what the hell is this? This orange machine that is selling some nebulous non-thing that is by FAR the most expensive item in the shop. 
Then they notice the machine sucks up your money instead of giving you money like normal ATMs, because many BTMs only work one way for some reason.
Maybe the interface should highlight the fiat options for getting into bitcoin i.e. $5 $10 $20. And they should DEFINITELY dispense cash to those wanting to sell.

You would benefit from a service I saw the other day (which I can't remember the name of right now, sorry) that sends transaction details via text to your phone. So instead of your typical point of sale system, you can have a static Btc address printed on a card or whatever and when someone sends Btc to it, you immediately know what the amount broadcast to the network was because the info is texted to your phone.

I recently tried out Mycelium. The backup option effectively creates an encrypted paper wallet which you print out and write on it the passcode the app displays for you ONCE. Then, if you spend money with the phone there is no issue with change addresses since the change address IS your public key address. And Mycelium does not have your private key, only you do. This seems to me a pretty decent cold storage solution as well as just an on-the-go mobile wallet app--or am I missing something?

The Bitcoin scene is overwhelmingly male, which is what this article addresses, while celebrating the tiny percentage of women who HAVE made contributions. Willful ignorance of this glaring disparity is not helpful. The blockchain may not care about it but anyone who wants to see Bitcoin grow and flourish should. All this highfalutin talk about empowering individuals through technology while sexist bullshit is routinely given a pass, either tacitly or even encouraged on this sub. Not by everyone, of course, but no wonder so many women feel turned off/unwelcome around here when you see some of the attitudes reflected. Kudos to OP and the women he profiles.

Inexpensive lesson: In theory HD seeds are excellent for restoring wallets but you have to write them down!
Another idea OP: I wouldn't use this with a non-trivial amount of money, but if it's just for $50 bucks on the go, RushWallet, which is an HTML-5 wallet, is an interesting option. Enables you to have the same wallet on your computer and phone since it's just a browser URL.

Bitcoin is digital cash. It's like handing someone a 10 dollar bill, except you do it over the net so they could be anywhere in the world, like sending an email. You don't  have to know or trust the person, they don't have to know or trust you, but you can be certain the payment was made and the money's good, just like with cash. The main difference: it is not issued by government and it can't be counterfeit. There is a lot more to it than that but I'm typing this on a phone.

I'm going to take a shot at this: Your private key is contained in the wallet.dat. It is from this private key that your public key (and hence address) was generated. For each public key/address contained in your wallet there is a separate corresponding private key. The wallet.dat therefore can contain many private keys. Backing up the wallet.dat will save all of them. But please if I got this wrong, someone else chime in (not an expert!)
p.s. An individual private key could be dumped/revealed/exported from inside the wallet if for some reason you needed to import it into another wallet. In qt for example you use &lt;dumpprivkey&gt; from the command line in the console.

This has given me a nice neat capital gains report at the end of the year using FIFO. Taxman can look at transaction records from exchanges if they want backup info.

I agree that would be best. On the other hand, it can't all be bleeding edge all the time. Straightforward use-cases have their place. Besides, it's not as if merchants accepting bitcoin is yesterday's news, there's in fact quite a lag with merchant adoption it seems to me. I think there's an opportunity here to encourage it, that's all.

Sitting on a side-table in my apartment is a post-it pad from bitcoin-trader.biz. Months ago I went to this event where the bitcoin car showed up and there were these friendly, earnest reps there pushing Bitcoin Trader. They explained how it worked, and I thought to myself, "oh interesting, bitcoin arbitrage pool". The returns on locked-in funds were something like one percent a day, which for some reason seemed totally reasonable and not in any way outlandish..
Later I found myself talking at the same event with an older gentleman who was investing in it and he swore by it. And I thought: "well of course there's money to be made in bitcoin arbitrage, after all anyone can see the prices never match up on these exchanges, it's such a new thing and market efficiencies aren't there yet, blah blah". I felt like I was on the inside track of an opportunity that was fundamentally new and different, and was smart enough to understand it. By the time I got home I was all set to beam over my bitcoins, but for some reason I didn't do it just then. 
Days passed, and my mind would occasionally drift to the post-it pad on the side-table with the beckoning URL. But, due mainly to a kind of inertia or, to put it bluntly, laziness on my part I just never got around to even visiting their website.
I'd like to think that inertia came from caution, perhaps an impulse toward even a shred of due diligence. But what freaks me out about this is it never once occurred to me that BTC-trader could be a Ponzi scheme. Despite the fact they were touting absolutely insane returns in the hundreds, nay THOUSANDS of percent annually. 
Hell, Bernie Madoff returned a measly 15 percent a year, he had a sterling reputation and even then there was a guy yelling it was a Ponzi to deaf regulators for years. I had read these accounts, had read numerous books on Madoff so figured I knew what a Ponzi looked like. Wrong. Fell for it hook AND line--but managed to dodge the sinker this time.
TL;DR: I'm more of a dumbass than I thought I was. But luckily for me, I'm a lazy dumbass.

Likely Hollywood lingo.
Roughly before the 90's motion pictures were edited on film. The film was cut into pieces using a device called a guillotine splicer and then reassembled with an editing machine. Parts were left out, of course. If a scene didn't make the cut it was known colloquially to have wound up "on the floor". This has become a metaphor for pretty much any kind of editing.

Had to chime in here: I recently put 20 bucks into one of these machines and it sent the BTC to an address I don't control. So it basically just sucked up my money and left me standing there looking/feeling like an idiot. I spoke to the operator, who was really cool about meeting me in person and returning the twenty bucks, but he said from his end it appeared as though the machine had issued me a paper wallet. But it 100 percent totally had NOT done that. He kind of didn't believe me, but DID concede there had been "software problems" with the machine in the past. I'm just glad it wasn't let's say $500 bucks that had disappeared.

There are other factor at play though. When I bought the bitcoins, my currency was about 10 % higher than it is now against the USD. So there's that benefit. Also, spending them once in a while works nicely as a hedge against precipitous drops in the value of BTC. Although I'm long bitcoin and buy it whenever I can, I do keep an eye on their dollar cost average, esp during times of downturn like now. Spending them once in a while takes the upward pressure off this number. 
I'm not sure that answered your question though  :)

Anyone can send funds to your public address whether you are on the Internet or not. It will work just fine. Keeping your private key private (don't reveal it) will ensure your funds are secure, and that only you can spend them. 
Spending them however, will, generally speaking, require you to use software that is connected in some way to the network. 
But you can always worry about that later if all you want to do right now is publish/show/transmit your public address to a sender.
Note: your public address will not appear on the blockchain until after the first time funds are sent to it. After that point, it will be there forever.
 If you like, you can use a web-based block explorer like blockchain.info to verify if someone has sent you funds by inputting your public address into the search box.

Some people actually do this by flipping a coin 256 times to create a binary representation of a bitcoin private key. This way you know you have created a genuinely random (large) number, which is really all a bitcoin private key is. The corresponding public key has a mathematical relationship to this number. Once funded, the public address corresponding to your key pair appears on the network (something like that).
Not something I would do, because the procedure is actually a little more complicated than what I've laid out, but thinking about how this RNG technique works has definitely given me better insight into bitcoin security. The security lies in the infinitesimally small likelihood of such gigantic random numbers ever being repeated or, of course, brute-force guessed by even the most powerful computers.
And since you've maintained physical control of a private key that has never been on a computer, let alone exposed to the Internet, this method is bullet-proof. Your key, your money. End of story.

Then came the European sovereign debt crisis and I wound up following that very closely for about a year when Cyprus happened. Suddenly, there was all this stuff about bitcoin which I had heard about before, but kind of ignored. 
Well I stopped ignoring it. It was like being hit between the eyes with a two-by-four. Within a week I had sunk most of the spare cash I had into buying bitcoins and even building a GPU rig to mine litecoin.

Why all the snark about private blockchains? Did anyone actually read this article?
A few quotes (emphases mine):
"At the core is the biggest innovation in computer science in a generation. It is the technology underlying the digital currency **Bitcoin—the blockchain.** This technology platform is **open** and programmable."
"The next generation of the **Internet** enabled not just the communication of information but the direct communication of value and money. What if we could build businesses, do transactions do transactions directly, **peer-to-peer without powerful intermediaries?"**
"Another group talked about blockchain and society and concluded that there was an opportunity to create a **fairer and more transparent world where the truth could be evidenced.** A third group looked at blockchain and identity, discussing the idea of each of us having our own **identity on the blockchain that was private and controlled by us, rather than by big social media companies, banks or governments.** A fourth group, chaired by MIT’s Brian Forde of the MIT Media Lab looked at opportunities to use this technology to **bring several billion poor people into the global economy."**
"I was leading a discussion on technology disrupters in banking and while there was big interest in understanding blockchain technologies most were not convinced that there was either a big danger or big opportunity.
**It kind of reminded me of 1994 when I advocated for something called the World Wide Web and many people’s reaction was “meh.”"**

There's definitely tradeoffs, and they skew in various directions depending on how much money we're talking about, so absolutely listen to your instincts. 
People on here are perhaps a bit overly cautious about 3rd party custodial solutions because of the memory of what happened in 2014 at MT GOX in which $400 million or so of customer funds went poof!
Of course, better practices have emerged since then but even in 2016 Bitfinex got hacked to the tune of $70 million, so there is definitely a reason for these concerns.
That being said, Coinbase has a good track record in this regard (so far!)

Yes and the passphrase scheme is a supported standard in the space.

For the time being download wallet software like Mycelium (android) or Bread Wallet (iOs). Back up the wallet (this involves writing down a 12-word nonsense phrase, also known as a "seed", generated by the wallet).
Once you have done this, withdraw your funds from Coinbase to the receiving address displayed on your phone/mobile. 
Wait a bit for the withdrawal to go through and you're done.
Why this is more secure is because in the background your wallet has generated a large random number (private key) from which your address is derived. This number is in your sole possession and it is so large it is not guessable by an attacker, so you now control any funds sent to the wallet. If you leave the funds on Coinbase, *they* have the key, not you, so you have to trust them to not lose your money.
The seed phrase will restore all your funds if you lose/damage the phone. Longer term look into paper wallets or hardware wallets for best security. Treat a mobile like a normal wallet--if you're talking thousands of bucks you might not want to be carrying that around with you everywhere.

Right but .01 bitcoin is $7.25 USD. So it's not about how expensive it is. That's like saying "money is expensive". Alts provide no advantages in this regard.

There are a number of well-documented issues wrt people in and out of the Trump inner circle. For example [Paul Manafort]( who was likely paid $12 million in cash in recent years by pro-Russian Ukrainian kleptocrat Viktor Yanukovych (anti-EU anti NATO etc). These sorts of things are enough to raise serious questions which will require senate hearings (at least) to thoroughly investigate. Fortunately that is precisely what is now underway with Senate Intelligence and probably other committees. I'd say it's a little dramatic to call it a coup, more like the usual sorts of investigations that can, do and should get triggered when serious questions pertaining to the US national interest arise.

I've used the local trader function on Mycelium and never had a problem. There's no requirement to meet vendors "in the street". You just meet them in the daytime in a public place like a coffee shop or even a bank lobby for example. They're not going to try to rip you off with cameras around. In addition, you can minimize the requirement to trust them by asking that you both wait for at least one confirmation on the network. But in reality even that's not necessary because Mycelium has a built-in mechanism that somehow queries the network to flag possible double-spends even prior to a confirmation.
@_date: 2016-12-26 12:39:26
Why not buy a small amount using QuickBT at first. Get to know your Mycelium wallet and how bitcoin works by moving the funds around between addresses in the wallet. If you have another device, try downloading Mycelium to that and recovering your funds to the new wallet using your backup phrase to see how that works. If you decide you like bitcoin and want to get into it more, getting an account on Quadriga might be a good idea since the fees are a lot cheaper than QuickBT or ATMs (0.5% per trade + maybe a fee to fund the account depending on which option you choose).
If you start accumulating significant amounts of bitcoin, learn how to best secure your funds with hardware or paper wallets.

You don't need to do mining to use bitcoin. They are very separate things, and only a small subset of bitcoin users do mining.
If you do choose to mine, however, a GPU won't get you anywhere these days. At the beginning of bitcoin, you could use a CPU to do it, but as it got more competitive miners needed more horsepower and started using GPU's. Then that became non-viable and specialized, very powerful hardware called ASICS came online. That's basically where we are today.
Although you don't have to do mining, the network would not function unless *some* people do it. Miners are essentially volunteers who do this work, and they are incentivized by the chance for a payout in bitcoin. Mining is necessary to secure the network since it is decentralized and there is no single authority to guarantee its integrity. 
That's the cool thing about the bitcoin network. No one owns it or controls it. It's just code that lives on the internet. And no one can stop it.

The wallet.dat is tiny. It's the blockchain that's huge. Back the wallet.dat up in multiple places. There's a way of changing the drive the blockchain downloads to (i.e. a large external drive to relieve congestion on your internal). In any case your funds are in no danger if you backup wallet.dat and don't forget the passphrase.

Most Marijuana dispensaries in US are cash-only businesses because they can't get banking relationships. Without a bank, how are you supposed to run your business using bitcoin? Even if you managed to totally close the loop with your employees, suppliers etc and everyone used bitcoin for food, rent, goods and services, you still have to collect and pay taxes on all your revenue. Right now, these businesses are forced to do this with truckloads of cash because banks won't take the cash and government entities of course will not accept bitcoin.

Ethereum is a set of decentralized protocols, like bitcoin, but for doing smart contracts on a blockchain. People are building a bunch of stuff on this. Some of the projects in this ecosystem are very decentralized, some less so--it depends on the specific use-case. I imagine some people are happy about having banks as clients because there's money in that. If you pay developers to work on this stuff that's a good thing. And it's not like they're trapped in dungeons somewhere--they can also use their expertise to go off and work on potentially more interesting projects that have wider implications for society than just making banks work better. Meanwhile whatever it is the banks do will always be more limited in focus and scope than the capacities of open networks, open protocols etc.

You don't really need to talk to your bank about this.

2) Set up a trading account (look into QuadrigaCX since you're Canadian). 
3) Transfer CDN funds via Interac to the account
4) purchase bitcoin

The idea was you could take the art but he would appreciate it if you got in touch and paid him for it. But no pressure. Seemed like a good use case for bitcoin! So I emailed and told him about it.
Long story short, the guy now has bread wallet and he sent me his address. When I went back, the art was gone but at least now he has another way to accept payment. 
 It took very little explanation to get him started and he was really enthusiastic about it. That was a first for me!

Put as much or as little as you want in, in dollar denominations the machine will accept. It will sell you any fraction of bitcoin that corresponds to the dollar value at the current exchange rate minus an ATM fee which is usually somewhere around five percent.

Generally speaking, people holding bitcoin are speculating that it will rise in value. If/when that will happen no one can tell. Best to learn about bitcoin and decide for yourself what the risks are versus the possibility of reward.
If what you discover appeals to you, don't forget there are many ways to get involved in bitcoin besides just speculating, though that's not a bad place to start.

I think your thesis is pretty good actually. In your essay you could argue the "flaws" arise from centralized entities that mediate economic life through antiquated systems that are not well-adapted to the internet. Because they enjoy a virtual monopoly on this way of doing things, and profit handsomely from it, they are not motivated or incentivized to innovate--and this is bad for the public.
The "opportunities" now available to the public have arisen because bitcoin is a new invention that has decentralized payments at a global scale, so now innovation can come from anywhere, without requiring permission from the old centralized gatekeepers.

The point of an exchange is to exchange one currency for another i.e. USD for bitcoin. Exchanges centralize the market so its an easy place to go and find people to trade with you. The problem comes in when the exchange assumes custody of your funds to facilitate the trades. Now you have to trust them not to lose, steal or otherwise seize your funds. You can minimize the problem by leaving the funds there only for the minimum amount of time necessary to execute the trade and then withdrawing. That being said, some exchanges are more trusted than others to act as custodians. Coinbase is quite well trusted.

Thanks for the link--but I'm going to have to beg to differ here. She doesn't say "forget bitcoin", the headline writer for Bloomberg does. She IS quoted as saying "I never became particularly enamored of cryptocurrency", but this is a rather qualified statement and my guess is it's been taken out of context to fit the bias of the piece.
Why do I think this? Consider this [video]( in which she touts the wonders of blockchain tech. Around 07:00 she is clearly describing a decentralized, open set of protocols with a bitcoin-incentivized security model (or other cryptocurrency).
I'm not a Blythe Masters fan, but to be fair it's a distortion to say that she's just going around slagging bitcoin.

Trying to fund it with $10 worth of BTC from the "select an amount" button also didn't work. After selecting a button, you are asked to "add a credit card" which doesn't make sense, then once you get past that screen to the QR payment request, you get a QR that is in an "unrecognized format". At least that's what mycelium said.

Right--but this gets back to my original question. Do I *really* need another device or is there a software solution to the problem (since this thread is about software solutions to annoying issues with bitcoin).
For example, wouldn't it be possible to use pattern recognition to convert a bitmap of a QR into the requisite alphanumeric string for copying into the clipboard, thereby making the address available to Mycelium or whatever other wallet software you want to send from--thus obviating the need for a second device.

Bitcoin was invented in 2008/09. No one knows the real identity of its creator, who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto. Since that time, the network has grown huge, with many billions of dollars flowing through it. Over the years, there have been various theories as to who Nakamoto really is, but they have all led to dead ends.
The latest twist in this saga happened when an Australian named Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi, and actually managed to trick prominent members of the Bitcoin community and some large media outlets into believing it by staging an elaborate hoax (this last point has been controversial, but is appearing less and less so).
One interesting thing about Bitcoin is that a combination of its cryptography and its public nature would make it quite easy for the real Satoshi to provide convincing evidence of his identity. Although Wright claimed to skeptics in the public and media that he would provide this evidence, he has since backed down from this promise.
To many, this was predictable given the past antics of Wright, whose behaviour points to the conclusion that he is a charlatan whose main area of expertise is creating drama and placing himself at the center of it.

They reprint press releases handed to them by PR companies whose clients pay good money to control the narrative. Fact checking what's that.

Usually a "release" for a doc is limited-engagement theatrical or television. A film festival premiere is not a release. Indeed a film can hopscotch from festival to festival worldwide for quite a long time before getting a release. My guess is if EPIX is involved, the spring TV premiere will constitute the release. I doubt a pre-release download window would be part of the deal. 
I am totally guessing here, and may very well be completely wrong.

Russ Roberts. An economist in his 60's with a distinctly Hayekian bent and a probing, non-doctrinaire podcast called EconTalk. Lately he has been ramping up the bitcoin-related episodes, having done recent interviews with Nathaniel Popper and Wences Cesares. He also did Gavin Andresen back when bitcoin was ten bucks or so--but not a whole lot in between. I think he is getting more interested in bitcoin these days, which is great to see because I've always liked his podcast and always wished he would cover it more.

Thing is, back in the 'old' days--for example throughout 2013-- there seemed to be a correlation between "good news" and price jumps in bitcoin, as one might expect. This disappeared entirely in 2014. The news kept on getting better (with the exception of a few notable headline grabbers) but the price relentlessly fell, creating the appearance of an inverse correlation between good news and price. 
Throw into the mix the disagreement over what actually constitutes good news in the first place (see: the monotously-deployed "This is Actually Good News" meme).
It's all black humor. Sort of like what happens among a bunch of people sitting around playing Blackjack.

Chain CEO Adam Ludwin, May 2015:
"When trusted institutions issue digital assets on the open Internet, financial services will be less expensive, more secure, work better together, and be accessible to more people around the world"
Aaaaand $30M from Nasdaq, Citi, Visa et al later:
"Pushing U.S. stocks or other assets into the Bitcoin blockchain and hoping that, say, China doesn’t attack it felt like a stretch"

Got into WAP authoring in 1998 or something because I was convinced mobile was going to be the next big thing. I was frothing at the mouth about the possibilities of location-based services to anyone who would listen.
I don't even bother bringing up bitcoin to people.

i didn't see anything about discounts. They said Adidas could offer special products only available to holders of the crypto. But that begs the question who is paying you.

I think it can be both bubbling in a corner **and** a big deal at the same time. Yesterday I went to buy a small amount of bitcoin at an ATM and by the time I had finished a line had formed behind me. I was like WTF no one ever used to use this ATM.

This is a great idea and I hope it's successful. The archive of all of this will be a valuable resource going into the future.
**EDIT:** Just noticed this long long list is just about entirely devoid of women. This sort of thing is a big problem going forward in bitcoin and it's a problem that doesn't just fix itself. The organizers can do better.

You could download a bitcoin wallet and withdraw the money from Changetip to your wallet. Probably the best way to start figuring out bitcoin if you feel so inclined.

Ethereum is another set of open protocols. It's permissionless, it is decentralized and uses POW for consensus. I don't get how it's a "private blockchain" (?)

Make sure the time capsule is TOTALLY waterproof. I made one in high school out of a donated plastic drink dispenser from McDonalds and on the last day of our senior year we buried it in the football field. 20 years later we dug it up. Most things were in tact, but water had found its way in and some things on paper were completely toast.

This is just anecdotal, but I've tried both and PayPal was so horrible I gave up on it almost right away. OTOH never had a problem buying stuff or transferring funds using bitcoin. But that's just me.

Gambling costs money, but can be fun. I find that gambling online removes a lot of the fun while still costing money. In either case, if you think it's a way of making money, you're doing it wrong.

Just give him a QR code anyway, and the private key.  Don't keep a copy. Explain that this will enable people to tip him either in person or over the Internet through YouTube for example. Send him a few bucks of Btc to get it started to show your appreciation for his busking. 
Let him know he has to trust you though when you say you can't move his funds. But also let him know he could set up his own wallet, if he doesn't want to trust you, by learning a little more about bitcoin.
Try not to sound like a crazy person while saying all this :)

QuadrigaCX is a decent exchange. I've never had any problem with it. All the other ones I've used over the years are not in business now. The usual caveat is: do not leave your bitcoin for an extended period on exchanges. Withdraw to a wallet you control the private key for. 
If you are in a larger city, there are also ATMs but be prepared for a 5-10% markup for the convenience (sometimes even more). I have also had success using Local Trader on the Mycelium wallet. And then there is localbitcoins.com which a lot of people use but I've never tried it.

I sold bitcoin in each of 2014 and 2015 and profited. In both years I reported it to CRA as long term capital gains as I held them for over a year before selling. To figure out the amount I used FIFO accounting. I put it on schedule 3 of the return and had to write it in somewhere as of course there is no line for "bitcoin"--I can't remember where I wrote it but I got a lady on the phone who told me where. I paid around 15% as I recall. I don't think you're supposed to report merely holding it, just any gains or losses realized.
Both years I got clean assessments so I'm assuming I did it the right way.

I don't think that's exactly true. For example I bought plane tickets in 2014 with btc that had gone up 10x in value. There's no question that was a taxable event--doesnt matter if the gains are realized in fiat or its equivalent in goods/services.
