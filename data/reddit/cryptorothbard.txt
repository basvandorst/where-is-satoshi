I’m sure this has been posted before, but this an essential read for anyone interested in bitcoin. See the abstract below:
“Cash is more than a method of payment. It is a fundamental tool for individual privacy and autonomy, and it is necessary for an open society. This paper shows that a cashless economy is a surveillance economy. It also argues that removing the option to freely transact without intermediation greatly limits our economic self-determination, placing our economic lives in the hands of financial institutions and governments. This paper presents several case studies demonstrating the dangers of a completely intermediated payments system and concludes that electronic cash is a tool that should not only be tolerated, but fostered and celebrated.”

WeChat is allowing a surveillance state...
“The bleeding edge of financial surveillance and profiling can be found in China. As the ​New York Times​ has noted, “China is systematically and rapidly doing away with paper money and coins.”33 Cash transactions are being replaced by mobile payments, which account for over $16 trillion annually—over 100 times more than in the U.S.34 The move away from cash in China happened in just a few years.35 While cash accounted for 96 percent of payments in 2012, today that number is below 15 percent.36 As of 2018, more than one-half billion Chinese use mobile payments.37
Tencent’s WeChat Pay and Alibaba’s AliPay are the dominant payment platforms in China, with a combined market share of 92 percent.38 These two companies have unprecedented visibility into almost all consumer transactions and are using the data they are gathering to develop credit scores for every consumer.39 The scores look not just at creditworthiness, but at social media and consumption behavior as well to determine “whether [the consumer’s] social behavior is healthy.”40
What counts as “healthy” behavior will be influenced by the Chinese government, which has encouraged and guided the development of Tencent and Alibaba’s scoring systems. Beijing sees them as the backbone of a Social Credit System to “rate each and every one of the nation's 1.3 billion citizens by 2020 using metrics that include whether they pay their bills on time, plagiarize schoolwork, break traffic laws or adhere to birth-control regulations.”41
Purchasing habits are noted by the financial intermediaries and can be used as an input to your Social Credit score.42 As an Alibaba executive told a Chinese magazine in 2015, the company judges the purchases consumers make.43 “Someone who plays video games for 10 hours a day, for example, would be considered an idle person, and someone who frequently buys diapers would be considered as probably a parent, who on balance is more likely to have a sense of responsibility.”44
A high Social Credit score will earn a citizen certain privileges. Today that includes expedited permission to travel abroad and access to express lanes at airports,45 but in the future it could grant your children placement at desired schools.46 A low Social Credit score, however, will lead to punishment, according to official government policy, including, “slower internet speeds; restricted access to restaurants, nightclubs or golf courses; and the removal of the right to travel freely abroad[.]”47 Already, over six million people are banned from taking flights, and another 1.65 million are not allowed to take trains.48
Your score doesn’t just affect you, but your friends and family as well. If your friend’s score drops because of something she said or purchased, your score will be dragged down with hers as well.49 This means that not only will people have an incentive to watch what they say and buy, but to police their friends and family as well. Not only will there be peer pressure to conform to “healthy behavior,” but official government policy states that the “new system will reward those who report acts of breach of trust.”50 In tips for individuals looking to improve their ranking, Alibaba today warns about the downsides of friending people with low scores.51
This kind of social control is made possible by intermediation. This kind of social control emerges naturally as the economy becomes increasingly dependent on dominant centralized intermediaries. These intermediaries, as a matter of course, surveil and record every action, which can then be judged and enforced algorithmically. The privacy and censorship resistance that permissionless cash affords serves as a check on such a systems of social control.
Today, Alibaba’s and Tencent’s credit systems are technically voluntary, but in the near future (perhaps as early as 2020) they will be mandatory for everyone in China.52 Similarly, cash is currently still available, but in order for the Social Credit System to work optimally, the government has every incentive to eliminate cash and replace it with intermediated money.
As should be clear, intermediation is not without consequence. An end to cash, a technology that we take for granted, will have an effect on liberties that we also take for granted. A cashless society cannot be an open society.”
