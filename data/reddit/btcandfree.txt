It is the nature of a good husband to pilot new horizons in search of mutual good fortune. It is also his duty to seek the counsel of his wife however concerned she might be and to seek her approval. In these two respects you have fulfilled your obligations. However your investment turns out, you are well grounded in the outcome and the core of your life will be in good shape. 
On a separate note, I endorse your entry point and asset allocation. But this is really secondary. 
Best Wishes

Good to see evidence of future buyers, if only emotionally positioned. They'll buy close to an intermediate top with their crowd and if they hold they'll do ok.

I've tried both. I first got Trezor's base model the model one. Worked for Bitcoin and I was happy. Then I decided to diversify and found myself having to buy Ledger. Ledger had other coins I thought might be good to pick up. But, that idea began to deteriorate and I got out of shitcoins before the debacle. I then got the Trezor model T. Moved everything into bitcoin and all bitcoin into it. Works great. Got a cryptosteel wallet to store my restore words and I'm feeling pretty secure and optimistic about the future.

I think you're planning for perfection. If you're really going to enter and exit on the stock flow model. I strongly suggest you DCA on both entrance and exit and you keep your positions for at least a year to get favorable capital gains tax treatment. You will experience regret but not the kind of life changing regret a total blow up due to bad emotional decisions where you have no understanding or experience and will wreak havoc upon your life. Listen to the advice here on that! Also, imagine waking up some day realizing that all you've done is bankrupt yourself with tax obligations.
Honestly, it's easier to HODL a couple or more halving cycles. You're young enough it sounds. DCA in until you're done. And when you are, I'll wager that you won't convert to dollars because that won't make sense anymore. Even today, you're not buying bitcoin. You're selling dollars.

Buy USDC on Coinbase by transfer from bank checking account. Send USDC to Binance. Buy BTC with USDC on Binance. Almost no fees. the BTC/USDC market is pretty thin however.

Wait. This article describes how to set API keys for automatic trading. Isn't this exactly what was compromised in the recent hack of their ecosystem? No thanks! HODL.
