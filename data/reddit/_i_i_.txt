I wonder where and where first, private people will be able to take 0% consumption loan. Think about it -- you'll be able to quit working, take a huge loan, and live of it, while paying it off with another 0% loans until you die. :D

"Life is change. Stability is death."
The only truly stable currency is a currency of no (0) value.

Physical machine to exchange two digital currencies (FED notes - BTC) is just nonsense. It always going to be more expensive (maintaining ATM costs money), and that's the reason the rates in these ATMs are so ridiculous.
In places like airports, to dump foreign currency at the end of the trip, it might make some sense, but otherwise not really.
I never even use normal ATMs. I just replenish cash at hand using cashback when doing groceries.

Eg. I create a new reddit account every ... couple of months. Because online spying, NSA and shit. I don't delete previous account, just stop using it.
There were at least 4 old accounts of mine subscribed to .

Same here. Previous ones were using Flash, so they worked OK in Linux...

Can you compare to Urbit?

Not necessary. Depending on how exactly it is being done. If you want to get a good understanding of all of it from non-ortodox economist, I highly recommend watching Steve Keen YT channel. He's a proponent of small "debt jubilee".

This. All recent articles on about it seem to be FUD. Like services supporting any other cryptocurrencies are in any way hurting Bitcoin.

All? Why? You want to buy something for $X, you send equivalent of $X to purse from your wallet, buy the same amount on Circle/Coinbase to replenish your total holdings. You risk only $X at the time for a brief moment.

The way I read it, it's not a sidechain. It's a replicated settlement database for some Bitcoin exchanges. It's a good idea still, but not a sidechain.

So many years, and yet Namecoin still does not have a decent (any?) standalone DNS deamon, that I could run locally to resolve .bit domains. It's just pointless without tools like this.

It actually makes a lot of sense. Exchanges are reputable, legal entities. They do have some level of trust, so don't need trustless, pseudo-anonymous ledger as Bitcoin. Liquid is a custom, practical solution built using Bitcoin -- not a "Bitcoin improvement".
Part of the reason classic fiat banks suddenly being so interested in blockchains is nonsense: they are reputable, known, legal entities as well. All they need is replicated log database and a little bit of cryptography for signing&amp;verification.

Why would they pay? That's the worst decision one can make -- only proving to the attacker that they can suck money out of you.
The only way is to just sit and wait until attacker just gets tired.

Not trust-less, not public, not anonymous, no PoW/PoS based.
You really, really need to squint your eyes to see a "sidechain" there because it's just a private transaction log with a multisignature wallet for participants.

With a raise of hardware wallets and multisig solutions, Armory seems already obsolete for me personally.

What's even interesting about? And what does it have to do with Bitcoin? Hyperledger is not pretending to be Bitcoin, and has completely different focus. Requiring an ID is nothing wrong or even unusual.
