That's what I'm wondering about next. It's probably a huge mess, also depending on the jurisdiction. In fact, every merchants seems to have different rules...
But I agree with you on your first point, the hardcore-liberalists seem counterproductive with such issues

But how does the merchant verify that it's really this person who owns the BTC? With credit cards this is possible.

Who will be your donators, rural indians or the BTC community?
You are probably facing the same problem with other donation currencies?

That's what I was thinking.
When I pay $5 online with my credit card, the information I submit in relation with that is probably more than enough from the Know Your Customer point of view (e.g. full name, billing address). Further, the data can be matched with the credit card institutions so I cannot enter fake data.
Same in your scenario, a bank transfer gives probably enough information to fulfill KNC requirements. So it makes sense what they claim.
I'm wondering, when using Bitcoin, even if the merchant asks for *everything*, even passport copies, there is still no guarantee to match that with a BTC address or to verify that it's really this customer who owns the BTC (contrary to credit cards where it can be matched). So how does KNC work with BTC anyway?
So, a customer could just keep a set of fake passport copies and everything and the merchant has no way to verify that.
