No, OP's post outlines how people with lots of capital can influence market movements so your question is already answered. The bitcoin market is so small right now that I really doubt any significant traders are concerning themselves with it. Market cap of 7.6 billion? Big money has better things to do with its time.

Hmm, I guess we can gloss over your blatant misrepresentation of history. It looks like you are now comparing the 'trustless' nature of the blockchain with the motto 'In God We Trust'. That's a little bizarre because no one asserted that the security of the dollar is attributed to God. Because that seems like such a fruitless way of looking at things, I'll assume you mean the difference between science and religion. 
Francis Bacon and Rene Descartes, of whose works I have read, were essentially the founders of scientific thought. They BOTH recognized the faith-based nature of scientific reasoning. For Bacon, the more empirical in my opinion, it was trust in sense that we had to allow for science to move forward. For Descartes, knowledge was perfect and therefore divine, so science really was a way to come to know God.
So there's your antithesis of trust in God I suppose; simply trusting something else. 
Again, if you could prove the accuracy of sense I'm sure the history of philosophic thought would shower you with praise. You might have a tough time though, for surely we are capable of false sense in waking life and in dreams.

Sell on an exchange like bitstamp or use coinbase.

Please do not come to this sub to 'talk price'.

This does not explain the huge sell pressure and lack of buy pressure on Gox. Arbitrage (what you are describing) would balance the market prices so that all of the markets would be about the same price. Arbitrage happens all the time. One of the reasons we know your theory is wrong is because of the huge, growing difference in price between exchanges and disproportionate buy/sell ratios on different exchanges compared to Gox. **PLEASE DO NOT STATE THESE SPECULATIVE THEORIES AS IF THEY ARE FACT** OP clearly doesn't understand markets enough to make claims like this and there are a lot of newbies who read these forums and will take OP's word as fact.

Are you asking how they would crash the market on an exchange and then buy in bulk?

My arguments are not straw mannish. I answered to both of your points in this last comment while also explaining why the question of 'In God We Trust' doesn't violate notions of the scientific age, as well as explaining that it's irrelevant to the discussion of bitcoin vs. the dollar because God is not used as proof of the security of the dollar. 
In all seriousness I'm not sure why I dedicated myself to this argument because you haven't even been willing to admit when you are incorrect. There's no way to make progress with someone like that I suppose. 
"The foundlings fathers, mostly atheists, kept religion out of the constitution."- This is just blatantly false. 
And your point about Jefferson the "*important one*" or I guess the only one you know about...
He wrote this in his original draft of the declaration, and that phrase is still in there: "... independent station to which the laws of nature &amp; of nature's GOD entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the change."

1080p HD videos, extensive collections on certain niches, no obnoxious ads and pop-ups, lots of videos are taken off free sites and you can access them, online time with live models, there are plenty of things that pay sites offer than free sites don't. I don't really understand the confusion. As someone who has found passwords to pay sites online and been behind the pay-walls, the video quality on those sites is far, far better than the blurry stuff you find on pornhub or whatever free site you use. To give you some examples,  has a lot of videos of the same caliber and definition that a pay site might (they illegally rip the videos from other sites I think).

They use a company called bitpay which converts the Btc to USD immediately. The funds aren't in Btc long enough for fluctuation to matter.

Should we black out the 'Eye of Providence' in the pyramid too? Oh while you're at it get rid of 'Annuit cœptis' -- He (God) approves-- proposed by Sam Adams in 1782. "And this be our motto: "In God is our trust." was written by Franis Scott key when he wrote the national anthem in the early 1800s. Or that it was the battle cry of Pennsylvania's 125th Infantry during the civil war-- essentially an expression of solidarity with Union soldiers. 
Don't be so quick to dismiss religious imagery, it's important to this country. 
Note: I am an atheist.

Lambert's history of religion in american politics (published at the Princeton University Press) goes through a lengthy exposition of the religious backgrounds of the founders. Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, 49 were Protestants, and two were Roman Catholics. I could go further in depth but there really isn't need, you can look this up on your own. I'd love for you to try to find support for your atheism theory, that might be a groundbreaking project worth publishing. 
Also, I thought I just explained why "In God We Trust" is an age-old thing...

600 Gh/s chip costs $4,680, if you have that money to throw around it may be worth it, I'm not sure. But your question was about your computer. Mine mined at 3.5 Mh/s, so that's a different story. The estimated price is calculated by the current market value of bitcoin, if the market drops your investment won't pay back. Read lower on the page, it lists a lot of stuff to think about that will give you a better idea of what you are getting into with mining. It says right there "With rising bitcoin exchange rates it might be more profitable to buy bitcoins than to mine. There are spreadsheets available in this thread or this one (with some FPGA data) for a more custom calculation.Bitcoin exchanges: MtGox, Tradehill, CryptoXchange."  Imagine waiting for the market to drop, putting 5k into it and watching your money triple in a matter of weeks during another boom. This seems like a way more flexible and profitable strategy rather than paying for expensive hardware that you might be stuck with, it might break, etc.

This question is really odd. Only you can decide what you want to do. Not all actions need to be driven by political ideology. If you want to use bitcoin you should.
