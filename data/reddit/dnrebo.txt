What coins do you mean? At that time I only knew about few main currencies. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Etherum and Dash.
So with Litecoin I would have made 3200€ profit considering that the buying price was 47€ and I would sell it today so 2,8k less than with mining.
With Bitcoin I would have made 3600€ profit considering that the buying price was 2600€ and I would sell it today so 2,4k less than with mining.
With Etherum I would have made 4600€ profit considering that the buying price was 241€ and I would sell it today so 1,4k less than with mining.
With Dash I would have made 3800€ profit considering that the buying price was 173€ and I would sell it today so 2,2k less than with mining.
But I mostly have mined Mooncoin so with that I would have made 4100€ profit considering that the buying price was 0.000044€ and I would sell it today so 1,9k less than with mining.
So overall I would have not made more money if I would have just bought the coins. And I would have not gained any knowledge abut blockchain and how cryptos work. Some might say that OOH YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT BITCOIN IN JULY AND SOLD IT IN DECEMBER, but I would have probalbly held it til now because of my nature of thinking... Im not saying that you 100% need to buy miner but Im just saying that from my experience mining with asics has been great and I have gotten smarter and wiser in cryptos and on top of that I have also gained financially.

I don't know what are you talking about. I bought a Antminer L3+ in the summer, it cost about 1,3k € with shipping and reached ROI in 1,5 months and pure profit is now over 6k €. For me it has been an amazing investment can't be happier I know I cant make huge amount of money anymore but still 300-400 € per month pure profit is still good for me (I pay about 40-50 € for electricity). And on top of that I have learned so much in such a short time.

You should own your private keys yourself no one else should have access to them. Somewhere in your wallet you should be able to view/see/export the keys. I myself use bitcoin core wallet and from there you enter a certain command with your secret key (password for your wallet) and then you will be able to see the key. If someone else holds your private keys they can get your money and just take it.
