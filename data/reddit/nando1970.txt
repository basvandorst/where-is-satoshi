The paper made it into the shortlist for the Blockchain Awards of the Bitcoin Foundation Conference 2014, category Visionary Academic Paper.
The funny part is that Nakamoto's paper is included too. Hey! Einstein is not supposed to be nominated for the Albert Einstein award! There is no competition. Now if only Satoshi would show up to receive the Award...
Since Satoshi appearance is unlikely, and instead I will be attending the conference, I could appreciate if the large silent majority of my enthusiastic supporters joins forces and votes for my paper at 
If you would rather vote for Satoshi, I might concede to your preference. 
No disrespect for the other shortlisted paper "On the origins of Bitcoin" by Konrad Graf:

what a confusion! I wonder if people prefer to fight or understand...
The best answer there states what is a loan, but does not explain how it could feasible in a deflationary economy. It is true that the deflation effect is just one of the contributions to the definition of a loan rate, but if it is out of proportion (as for bitcoin) it is a dominant effect.
Loans will never be feasible in a high deflation economy, at least not real long-term high-amount loans. This is true for any kind of currency.
This fact is just a reality check away.

This is not exact. As soon as a cryptocurrency is exchanged for something else you can observe a price and perform the monetary stock rebasing to gain stability with respect to the selected target price.
Reading the paper might help the discussion...

This monetary base adjustment has neutral impact on the overall wallet wealth, as it does not introduce any arbitrary distortion into the intrinsic value dynamics of the wallet

what is the centralized point of failure being introduced?
how is it killing what?

Nobody today would incur debts in terms of bitcoins, or agree to pay a salary in bitcoins, as the liability could grow (and historically has grown) hundredfold in few years. This is hindering adoption.
Please read Chapter 4 if you can, here's an extract:
[...] even if happy in these bitcoin-blessed days, Hayek would have been nonetheless the most ferocious critic of the complete lack of cryptocurrency price stability. His comments about the hypothesis of private money backed by gold are a perfect match for bitcoin too, just replace gold with bitcoin in the following paragraph: It would turn out to be a very good investment, for the reason that because of the increased demand for gold the value of gold would go up; but that very fact would make it very unsuitable as money. You do not want to incur debts in terms of a unit which constantly goes up in value as it would in this case, so people would begin to look for another kind of money: if they were free to choose the money, in terms of which they kept their books, made their calculations, incurred debts or lent money, they would prefer a standard which remains stable in purchasing power.
The unfeasibility of a bitcoin loan is similar to that of a bitcoin salary: neither a borrower nor an employer would want to face the risk of seeing their debt or salary liabilities grow hundredfold in few years. A manufacturing firm cannot accept an order in bitcoin with the risk of its value doubling or halving on a single bad day. Even the development of a derivative market could only hedge these risks with an implausibly high price.

yes, you're right that is the main challenge, even if it might be easier than expected because the intrinsic revaluation of quatloos due to increasing adoption will imply an increasing number of quatloos in every wallet for the next few years
Please read Chapter 4 if you can, here's an extract:
Comments are in order about this unfamiliar scenario: the idea of a wallet changing its number of coins without any direct inflows or outflows is surely an uncomfortable one. This is a cultural and psychological change of paradigm that will require some effort to be accepted: currency volatility will not be discovered by price volatility anymore but by money amount volatility instead. In other words the wallet change of value is not reflected on prices, but instead on the number of currency units. This last point should be carefully examined to appreciate that, notwithstanding the familiarity of the customary price impact, adjusting the money amount is the least irrational and disjointed means of absorbing a change of the value of money itself. This is the only way to avoid that money, being the very special good used as unit measure of value, improperly damages the whole price system because of its own value volatility. As for the acceptability of this change of paradigm: if the huge appreciation of cryptocurrency that we have experienced in the last years will become orders of magnitude higher in the future because of the cryptocurrency adoption growth, people will be introduced to the variable wallet amount in the very pleasant way of continuously increasing number of coins.
Last but not least, the variability of the number of fiat currency units in our wallets is already happening, mutatis mutandis and with the aggravation of severe unfairness, even if the man on the street is not aware [and goes on with the analysis of the current monetary policy standards]

I do not want to sound rude, but it is kind of surreal this debate between you and the Nobel-prize winning economist F. Hayek :-)
Nobody is denying that gold has been successful, and if you read my paper you will appreciate that I document that.
Nonetheless borrowing in a high deflationary economy is a crazy choice, and it is not matter of opinion, it is matter of fact. You will not find any rational human being borrowing in bitcoin. If you do, please check back in a couple of years and he will be bankrupt.
Also the press coverage about bitcoins salaries are a gross journalistic simplification: no employer could pay in bitcoin without going bankrupt, unless his inflows are in bitcoin too.

there is an interesting debate going on at 
worth checking out if you are interested in this topic

please read the abstract


@_date: 2014-05-05 18:27:55
point taken, I've rephrased the abstract. Now if only I could get people to read the paper :-)
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:05:16
thank you. While it is expected that contrarians are the first ones to object, it is comforting to receive some support :-)

Let me say that I was the one proposing to the event organizer to invite Andreas, and suggesting Andreas to tackle this subject because of the bankers in the audience. Of course I've learned a lot from him.
BTW in the morning, Andreas also had a lecture on SegWit and LN for an audience without bankers, but including my students.

the issue was on Android, they patched the problem (didn't solve it completely), so bad (null) address 14p5cGy5DZmtNMQwTQiytBvxMVuTmFMSyU should not be displayed anymore
