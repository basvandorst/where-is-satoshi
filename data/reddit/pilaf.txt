It's not impossibly hard, but there's nothing even close to buying from Coinbase convenience-wise. There are a couple exchanges, although one of them got their bank account unexpectedly closed recently. You can also use LocalBitcoins or other similar websites, or buy from someone at a Bitcoin meetup.

It's the number of merchants accepting Bitcoin in each area. These are screenshots from [CoinMap]( zoom in to see the individual merchants.
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:35:37
I don't know much about other countries, but here in Argentina there's a decent amount of merchants who take bitcoin. I can't say you'll be able to get around entirely using bitcoin, but at any rate you should be able to find someone to trade with for pesos (through LocalBitcoins, for instance).
The higher concentration of bitcoin merchants in Argentina is in Buenos Aires, but several other touristy cities have at least a hotel or some other hosting option that takes bitcoin.
Use [CoinMap]( and [MercadoBitcoin]( (similar to CoinMap, but regional) to find merchants along your way.
Feel free to PM me with any questions you may have.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:42:20
Where in Argentina will you be staying? The Buenos Aires area has several places that accept bitcoin, but there's probably not enough variety for you to live exclusively on it.
As suggested, check Coinmap to find shops. You may also want to try [Mercado Bitcoin]( which is similar to Coinmap but local, as sometimes shops show up there that don't show on Coinmap.
As for bars and restaurants, there are maybe 5 or 6 in Buenos Aires that take bitcoin at the moment. Not a huge number, but if you're looking to contribute to the local bitcoin economy over your comfort then you may want to check them out. Here's a list of the ones I know of:
* [AntiDomingo]( - Restaurant/Bar. Been there, the pizza is OK, the place is rather nice. Make sure you have a data plan on your phone if you plan to pay with bitcoin though as they don't have WiFi (crazy, I know). Also tell the waitress that you're planning to pay with bitcoin beforehand, as I found out the hard way that they're not very well trained in that and they might have to contact the owner for assistance.
* [Röt Bar]( - This one just popped up on Coinmap, I've never been there, but it's located at an area with many fancy bars, so this one probably is too.
* [Fukuro Noodle Bar]( - Japanese noodles restaurant. Never been to it either, but I'm planning to. Their website is partially in English, so I guess it's at least tourist-friendly.
* [El Histórico]( - Argentine cuisine Restaurant in old part of town. Never been there, but it looks like it might be good, and it's located in a touristy area.
* [Fileteados Porteños Club de Café]( - Never been here either. It's very close by to El Histórico.
There is also an organic vegetables delivery service, in case you're the cooking type and will have access to a kitchen: [Tierra Buena Delivery](
If you need hotels, there are two in Buenos Aires that take bitcoin as far as I can tell:
* [Prodeo Hotel](
* [Che Lulú](
I haven't been to either so I can't talk about their services.
There are also a few hotels that take bitcoin in other parts of Argentina, make sure to check Coinmap/Mercado Bitcoin if you plan to travel within the country.
Selling bitcoins is also viable, in case you want to limit the amount of fiat you carry with you through the airport, but you'll have to meet the buyer in person through LocalBitcoins or [ConectaBitcoin]( (a local clone of LocalBitcoins). Also PM me if you're looking to sell, as I might be able to find you a better rate.
Feel free to ask me any questions, I'll try to answer to the best of my knowledge.

I seriously doubt it. Argentina doesn't even have an online bitcoin exchange at the moment, and that's unlikely to change soon. Sites like LocalBitcoins remain the only option for buying bitcoins, and that's still quite inconvenient for most people.
You also have to consider that most people here are trying to run away from a volatile currency, and bitcoin isn't a very attractive escape route in that sense in most people's minds.
Finally, Argentina has nowhere near the amount of tech savvy people China has.
I'm not saying bitcoin won't continue to grow in Argentina, and it will probably remain the largest adopter in Latin America for some time, but likening it to China at this point is just sensationalism to me.

In all fairness you'll probably get the usual "gold has real life uses, it can be used for jewelry and electronics", which is an obvious true statement, although a misleading one as it fails to account for the vast majority of the value of gold.
Take copper for instance. Just like gold, copper can be used for electronics and jewelry, yet gold is [%480000 as expensive]( What makes the difference? Gold is arguably prettier and has better conductivity, but that surely can't account for such a huge difference in price. The value of gold comes mostly from its scarcity, which is a property it very much shares with bitcoins. The fact that people want their jewelry made out of gold is *because* gold is so valuable, and not the other way around.
Hope this helps you in your debates.

Well, we already say "millibits", "microbits", etc., which are likely to be more useful units than full bitcoins (millibits already are at the current price). I think popularizing those units will do a lot for dispelling the myth that you can only buy/spend full bitcoins.
"Bitcoin" as the name of the protocol is just fine though, it gives you a better idea of what it's about than just "bits".

The less technologically apt are also the most likely to get their bitcoins lost or stolen. Encouraging them to buy bitcoins at this stage is a great way of worsening Bitcoin's reputation.
Also, Bitcoin's volatility is not very attractive to people trying to flee an unstable currency like the Argentine peso, and yet another reason to give Bitcoin a bad name if the price tanks.
Bitcoin has to be adopted at its own pace by people who understand the risks involved. By forcing it on others you're only doing it harm in the long run.

The only way that would be profitable is if you managed to exchange pesos for US dollars at the official rate, for which you need permission from the Argentine government. I'm not sure how hard that is for non-Argies to pull off (AFAIK foreigners don't have the same restrictions as Argentine citizens), but I bet it wouldn't be easy, if at all possible. Then again, the same trick would apply if you took bitcoins out of the equation and simply dealt with pesos and dollars, so it's almost certainly not possible.

People in this sub keep bringing that up, but that's not really an issue. Plenty of people sell BTC for pesos, including myself. Sure, pesos are worth less every day, but you underestimate how much people in Argentina need them for their day to day life. I need pesos to pay for my rent, I need pesos to buy my groceries, I need pesos to pay my taxes, etc. Whenever I get the chance I spend bitcoins, but we're far from being able to pay for everything with them. Until then, pesos are a necessary evil.

I do hold most my coins, but I pay for stuff with them whenever I get the chance. I've also developed a tendency not to buy anything I don't need right away if I can't pay for it with BTC, which has helped me avoid frivolous spending and save more.

A better question could be "who is bitcoin good for?".
If you live in the highly developed part of the world with a stable currency and easy access to a vast financial infrastructure, then bitcoin is probably not much better for you than what you're already using unless you distrust the institutions that control those currencies and services. Many of the early adopters of bitcoin belong to the group that's not happy with the status quo, and therefore bitcoin is good for them as a means to fight that.
If you belong to the bottom half of the world, with a wildly inflated currency and/or little or no access to banking services, then bitcoin should be appealing to you.
Then again, bitcoin allows things that were never before possible which will enable a lot of innovation in the same way that the internet did, so simply comparing it to what you have now and dismissing it is very short-sighted. I suggest you watch [this talk]( to get a taste of what could be possible with bitcoin.


It's not anonymous, it's pseudonymous, and it's only traceable to real people as long as you make your addresses publicly known.


Probably to protect himself from persecution. It doesn't really matter though, his ideas are what's important, and bitcoin is fully open source so it can be fully scrutinized by anyone, that's the ultimate form of transparency.

@_date: 2014-12-02 05:21:15
That's not entirely accurate. AFAIK BitPagos allows merchants to accept both bitcoins and/or credit cards and pays them in either bitcoins or pesos, but at least in the case of Avalancha they only use BitPagos as a bitcoin payment gateway (they handle credit cards through other providers), and I assume they convert a part of their bitcoin earnings -if not all- to pesos.

Quick rundown of the interviews for those of you who don't speak Spanish:
The first guy is a restaurant owner who accepts bitcoins. He explains the mechanisms of paying with bitcoins at a brick and mortar shop and how much a typical dinner would be in bitcoins (roughly). He then gets asked how many people pay with bitcoins at his restaurant, to which he says it's now around 5 or 6 customers a week (with around 2 a week a year ago).
The second guy is an economist. He says he sees paper money disappearing in the future and money going digital. He then talks about his perceived weaknesses in Bitcoin: variable pricing of goods from country to country [never heard that one before], lack of a central bank to adjust the supply and lack of a financial system.

Agreed, but with Bitcoin's track record this year (-50%) it's looking even worse than the Argentine peso (25% annual inflation, although I guess it could go higher now). With those figures Argentines looking for a more stable store of value are far more likely to put their money in dollars, euros or gold than in Bitcoin, and understandably so.

I think they've already implemented it. I did a test checkout a few days ago and got to the "pay with bitcoin" screen (the use BitPagos). I didn't buy though as it wasn't something I actually needed, I was only testing it, but I may buy something soon.
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:44:57
I really hope to see proper Argentine exchanges up and running soon, but at this stage I remain a bit skeptic. I knew of Unisend.com.ar as well, they claimed to be going live "next week" for a while and never delivered. PampaBits has been "coming soon" for months now. It may be the case that they're playing it carefully and will eventually go live, but at the moment it all seems like vapor. Hopefully I'm wrong.
I agree that the sentiment aspect of China was overplayed (i.e. bitcoin is not mainstream in China), but unlike Cyprus the Chinese were actually buying in droves. Maybe something will happen in Argentina that will trigger a new run up like the one from April, but I doubt we'll see the Argies buying in the way the Chinese did, it will be sentiment driven by buyers elsewhere instead.
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:20:10
I understand that, but I see it as a non-problem. Why couldn't they provide the option to donate with bitcoin hidden from the general public? i.e. Don't touch the current donation page, but still provide a separate "donate with bitcoin" page and announce it where it matters (e.g. this subreddit).

Holding pesos long term is certainly not desirable, but people here still need pesos for everyday life, so someone with bitcoins may want to sell some for pesos just to get through their daily needs. This in fact happens a lot, as there's no shortage of people buying bitcoins for pesos. The exchange rate used is the price of bitcoin at "blue dollar", which makes it seem like there's a premium, but it's really no different than buying dollars with pesos (at "blue" price, as there's no other way) and then buying bitcoins with the obtained dollars.

I'm definitely thinking of repeating it, but I think weekly would be too much, it would both dilute the tips (tippers need time to reload after all) and annoy the mods over at I think it could be a monthly thing though.
I also believe it's better if the initiative comes from within so that it doesn't feel like an invasion (even if it's ultimately a good one). I'm a regular at that sub and an Argentine myself. I know how to create a tipping thread more in tone with the sub (Spanish is preferred after all), identify locals (as opposed to non-local beggars coming from other subs like the many that flooded the thread today) and answer questions in the local language.
That said, assistance from other tippers is super appreciated. I had help from a large number of awesome bitcoiners today and I'm incredibly thankful to all of them.

Now that you mention it, no, I didn't receive it (no need to resend it though). Your comment looks correct to me though, did you have enough balance in ChangeTip?
Otherwise try separating the amount from the unit, e.g. "100 bits" instead of "100bits".

It depends. I was just comparing prices between FlyHi and BTCTrip, and in some cases BTCTrip was cheaper.

I really like the interface, this has potential.
Just one suggestion: it seems when you hit a place with no loaded merchants you get the message:
    There are no places in $LOCATION that accept bitcoin :(
Which makes it sound like there are literally no merchants taking bitcoin there when it may just be that you don't have any loaded. It would be better if it said something like "We don't know of any places that accept bitcoin in $LOCATION yet", or something like that.

It could have been made with just USD, but then it wouldn't be international and globally accessible (globally as in *to everyone*, not just in a geographical sense).
I live in Argentina. If ChangeTip didn't use bitcoin I would most likely not even be able to top up my account other than by receiving tips from kind strangers, and I'd be completely unable to withdraw my tip earnings.
Edit: Thanks for the gold, whoever that was!

Unlike your laptop bitcoins are durable, fungible (i.e. any one bitcoin is worth the same as any other, whereas your laptop isn't even worth the same as an exact same model that's brand new, simply for being second hand), almost infinitely divisible, have no weight and are impossible to counterfeit. In addition to all that they can be transferred instantly anywhere in the world.
There's nothing preventing you from using your laptop as money, but it simply isn't very practical. Bitcoin is a far superior form of money for all the properties listed above, and it can be argued that it's an even a better form money than fiat money (or at least some government-issued money).

Yeah, "forcing" was a bad word choice, sorry about that, but then again the Bitcoin community at large tends to be rather pushy, which is usually not very appreciated.
Bitcoin is not completely unknown in Argentina, and in fact has a rather large users community (compared to other countries in the region at least), some of which are very active in promoting its use. I've seen some go a bit too aggressively about it though, like giving out waiters' tips in Bitcoin paper wallets, or talking in general about it rather disingenuously, overstating its benefits and ignoring its risks. Because of that attitude people in as an example, are immediately dismissive of anything Bitcoin-related.
I like the idea of more widespread educational material, but I'm a bit wary of any kind of "in your face" promotional campaign.

I think he could have expressed himself better, but he's talking about the chain of ownership within the blockchain (the ledger) and how that enables the creation of digital assets that can't be replicated (i.e. bitcoins can't be copied).

Very shoddy journalism. They're confusing development of Dark Wallet with development of Bitcoin itself. Anyone watching this report who doesn't know better would come out thinking that's where Bitcoin was originally developed, and that Amir Taaki was its author.

Are there any plans for an API for this? I see potential for creating printable stickers with tips for strangers to find around cities (way easier than dealing with private keys), but creating all the tips by hand would be a PITA.

I just arrived to Amsterdam yesterday. Came here with a plane ticket I bought with Bitcoin (BTCTrip.com), staying at a room I booked with Bitcoin (9flats.com), had dinner at a Thai restaurant that takes Bitcoin, and tonight I'm planning on ordering delivery with Bitcoin (thuisbezorgd.nl).

Argie here.


For those who know about it and are brave enough to try it, sure. Not many people heard of it though, I still find myself having to explain what it is to almost every person I bring up the topic with, and those who have heard of it are often very ill-informed (e.g. people thinking bitcoin's value has completely collapsed since the closing of SR). It's slowly making its way into the collective psyche though.


"Lots" by global bitcoin standards, maybe. Take a look at Argentina in coinmap.org, it's definitely the largest bitcoin hub in Latin America, but it's still a long way away from becoming mainstream.
Happy to answer any more questions.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:07:54
Yours isn't bad, except it depends a lot on people's familiarity with CoinValidations' logo, which unfortunately looks a lot like the plain Bitcoin logo, so at first glance it looks like a "Say no to Bitcoin" logo.

No. In fact, the bitcoin unit is rather arbitrary considering that it's divisible up to 8 decimal places, so there's really nothing special about it other than the psychological effect its roundness seems to have on many people.

Thanks. I am in contact with the Bitcoin Argentina Foundation, they are great people and have been very helpful, but since I'll be receiving payment from an American company I need to figure out what would work best for them. So far Coinvoice seems like the top choice, but I haven't found any user experiences.

Never been to Gran Bar Danzon, but it looks good. There are also a couple places that take bitcoin, but they may be harder for you to get to and would limit the options:
* [El histórico]( (more of a restaurant than a bar, most likely doesn't serve Havana Club or any cocktails at all)
* [AntiDomingo](
I have a pretty open schedule this week, but the sooner we set on a day the better. Do you speak Spanish, BTW?
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:16:29
The legitimacy that wider merchant adoption brings to bitcoin is far more important in the grand scheme of things than the effect those merchants cashing out to fiat could cause on the price. Eventually as bitcoin becomes more mainstream and stable we'll start to see more merchants holding rather than cashing out, but until then it's a very good thing that the option exists to receive fiat from bitcoin payments as it speeds up adoption.
Think of it as a transitional scaffold as we move towards building a closed bitcoin economy.

I've never used an exchange (I can't from where I live), so to me there's quite a bit of mysticism around the way they work.
* When you buy/sell at an exchange you're not really buying from the exchange, but rather from someone else who's interested in that same deal, is that right?
* How are prices adjusted? I understand that buying pushes the price up, selling brings it down, but how exactly does that happen? How is the amount by which price moves determined, and how can it be trusted?
@_date: 2013-10-20 19:58:10
There are plenty more listed for Argentina in  (similar to Coinmap, but catering to a Spanish speaking audience). I bet the same is true for other Latin American countries. I may take some time to copy some over to Coinmap later.

I've been to Sugar, it's not bad. Every time I've been there it was completely packed, but it probably wouldn't be the case on a Wednesday. It's very popular among American expats, so I'm pretty sure at least the staff would speak English.

Yeah, you can use any of these, check the "sell bitcoins" sections, and make sure to check the buyers' reputations:
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( - Used it a few times, had no problems. They provide an escrow service and mediate if there's any trouble.
* [ConectaBitcoin.com]( - Never used it, but I know the guys who manage it and they seem like responsible people. Again, check for reputations.
* [LatinCoin.com]( - Just echoing recommendation for completion, never used it and I have no opinion on it.
* [CryptoCambios.com]( - You buy directly from the site at the price they set. This one's by invitation only, PM me if you're interested.
If you're near CABA try attending a micro-meetup, they happen every so often and there's always people willing to trade.

That's because their writing system consists mostly of characters that fit nicely in a square (as opposed to Latin letters which vary in size), and so they need special punctuation characters that also conform to that "square frame" to keep their text pretty and grid-like.

* Chinese:！！！ (no in-between spaces)
* Latin: !!!

In theory one could take advantage of the other information the image includes, like the font used, the fact that it's a monospaced font (meaning you could single out exactly which pixels belong to each character), and the approximate amount of blur used to significantly cut down the number of combinations needed to try to find the actual key.

Bitcoin gains value because it excels at being money.
For anything to be good at being money it has to have a set of properties: scarcity, portability, value density, divisibility, fungibility and difficulty to counterfeit. Gold is pretty good at all of these, which is why humanity adopted it as money in the first place. Bitcoin is at least as good -and often better- than gold at each one of these, and it even has some new interesting properties no other form of money has, like being programmable. That's what makes it attractive as money and why it has any value at all to begin with.
As to why it has the value it has today, that's largely due to speculation.

You could argue that printing fiat money wastes way more resources, and the energy use of computing will keep dropping over time.


This is true now, but it should get better over time as we get more and better services and infrastructure around it. I'd say the argument here is that it's still not mature enough.


Also solvable with third party services where it matters.
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:45:27
If you're buying through LocalBitcoins I believe the site will set up a wallet for you automatically and send your bitcoins there after the escrow is released. That means you shouldn't worry too much about having an address ready beforehand, but you should still move your coins somewhere safer after you get them.
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:45:37
Thanks. I'm not intending it for any kind of tax evasion, but since I've seen a few stories on here here about banks stopping business with people simply because they've used bitcoin I thought I'd ask about those kinds of risks.

Wouldn't selling them produce a faster ROI with less speculative risk though?
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:41:17
Too high as in you think it will go down? Or too high to buy a whole coin?
If it's the latter, then consider buying a smaller amount. If the price doubles from what it is now you'd have effectively doubled your investment regardless of how much you put in.

Hey Jeffrey, sorry about the harsh comment. I really appreciate what you're doing for bitcoin awareness, but I've often seen you exaggerate on the adoption of bitcoin in Argentina and South America in general.
I don't know which sites you're referring to. There have been a few instances of apartments for rent/sale where bitcoin was explicitly accepted, but those are very rare cases. One of those actually [made the news]( recently, which as nice as it is, it shows it's far from being a common thing.
That said, there seems to be growing interest down here. I've been to a "micro" meetup in Buenos Aires a couple weeks back and the place was completely crowded with possibly over 80 people in attendance. You should try to contact the [Argentine Bitcoin Foundation]( to get straight facts about the state of bitcoin here.
Keep up the great work.
@_date: 2013-08-09 18:50:12


That's absolutely sensationalized. He makes it sound as if bitcoin was already mainstream here, when in reality you'd be hard pressed to find anyone willing to accept it, leave alone know what it is. Sure, there's a growing Argentine bitcoin community, but bitcoin is still far from being as ubiquitous here as this article makes it seem.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:14:48
Don't get too discouraged by the negative comments vocal few, most subreddits have a lot more lurkers than posters, and I'm sure isn't the exception, so someone may have benefited from your post even if they go silent about it.
Bitcoin is still facing a lot of hostility and skepticism, it's only human nature when it comes to something so radically new, so have patience.
By the way, I think you're wrong about Argentina having such small bitcoin adoption. It's small compared to big players like the US, Europe and China, but Argentina is still the regional leader when it comes to bitcoin, just take a look at  There clearly is a growing interest, and with good reasons.
@_date: 2013-07-26 18:43:53
Argie here. I think that's just a common case of "fear of the unknown". Not sure whether it's got anything to do with Argentine culture, I've found similar amounts of naysaying elsewhere in the wild, usually coming from ill-informed people.
That said, Argentines have been through a long history of financial woes, so it may be the case that these people are extra-sensitive because of that, especially when faced with something so seemingly unstable as bitcoin.
Edit: I just checked lapostapepe's comments. I think he's just a troll.

@_date: 2013-11-18 02:38:31
I do stress those points quite a bit when explaining it, and people often find them appealing. Bitcoin is a beast to fully wrap your head around though, so it's only natural that people would be a bit apprehensive about it, at least until they start seeing it endorsed by names they already trust. Even my more tech-savvy friends (or most of them at least) are a bit skeptical about it, but they're starting to turn around.
@_date: 2013-08-06 03:00:01
