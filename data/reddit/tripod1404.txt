Lol with that logic they should be looking for you as well, in case you are related to  russia or terrorism.

IMO sell when you need money to buy something.

Man..at this rate bitcoin will leave half of the human population castrated
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:28:23
Well both are equally ugly imo.

Yeah, but unlike bitcoin cash, America also doesn't use the word "England" in their name. 
It is not called English states of America. If you honestly want to start something new, you choose a new name. You don't use confusing name to generate a false sense of security.

Old people are scared of new things, I am not surprised. Most old people were also in favor of banning internet when it first became popular. Now they share pictures of the cookies them made.

Well Tesla would probably accept bitcoin if that was the case. 
Elon Musk is turning into a new Steve Jobs that his fanboys adore like a god.

you can buy houses, you can buy anything on newegg, you can probably buy anything if your search for a vendor long enough.

Yeah but volume-wise USD is much much higher. This doesn't even include the so called "offshore accounts" or money in Swiss banks that billionaires are using to avoid taxes and/or run illegal or gray scale businesses.  IF we include tax evasion trough those as illegal, the percentage would be much higher for USD.

That ultimately comes down to what you define the government to be. Is it an extension of the peoples collective will or an independent entity. Does it represent people or companies. Government would benefit more from the internet if they made it something controlled entirely by the government. But the moment you implement that, you wont be elected the next elections.  
If  majority of people is in favor of the bitcoin, for how long government can work against it. Eventually it will result in government being run by people who support it.

Their servers are experiencing heavy load. If you were able to go to the conformation page, it would be fine. Otherwise traction will fail and it would be same as you didnt sold anything. Either case your money wont get lost.

It opens if you hodl the door.

lol i am not your personal google assistant go check yourself.

Most of those guys panic and sell when it dips :). Which makes the dip even nicer for long time hodlers.

If you live in US, you would need to pay taxes for it anyways. If you are not in us, I doubt you would need to pay taxes. 
So in terms of the end user, it doest change that much (unless bitcoin is being used for illegal activities).

beta crash

The issue is profitability. If everyone who owned bitcoin would allocate 1-2% of their CPU power while their PCs are on to bitcoin mining, it would create significant processing power. Actually that is what Satoshi originally intended. Of course at current difficulty levels, it would only be effective if a software would "combine the processing power" (similar to the nodes of bitcoin farms). 
Overall, it would still require server like computer(s) to manage the CPU network, but owning the server would not be like owning a bitcoin farm. It would be like owning webpage. People come on use your page. But you own just a webpage, you dont own 25% of the internet like some of the bitcoin farms.

I would say coinbase is still the best option. Serves overloading and crashing is bad. A Company going bankrupt or getting hacked and losing your bitcoin is bad bad bad.

I tried. Cats got aggressive towards each other. Made herding impossible since when cat density increased above a certain threshold, they started fighting. Tried to use a shepherd dog, made things even worse for some reason.

Without the crypto, it would be really hard to convict you of the crime. So jailing would also be pretty hard. 
Aside from that jailing someone because they use or have crypto is pretty far fetched idea. That assumes there is a general consensus among the population is that the use or possession crypto is a crime punishable by prison.
Government can also, in theory, jail you for wearing a blue jacket. What stops them is the public opinion on that matter, if majority of people disagrees with what government intends to do, it cant be done. It will result in government change. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:50:44
I am the OP :). What I am saying is it would be pretty hard to convict someone of a crime without having the actual evidence for possession.
And for the cannabis laws. They are getting more relaxed as the public consensus is shifting towards "not-illegal". It wont happen overnight but if something has widespread use, it will be hard to make it illegal.

For lambos. To bad they are out of stock.

Well we will at least have something to look forward to if bitcoin fails.

I don't think there is any single unit that can mine 1 coin a day.
