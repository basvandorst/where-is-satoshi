I was literally viewing some videos about cloud mining today and heard it would be better to use your own pc to mine.
Viewed some a few 8month old videos about nicehash and went to their broken site but I thought they stopped a while back or something lol.

App store reviews are more directed to app developers so they can see if there is something wrong or not with their app.
I'm pretty sure there are crypto review pages, which would be a better place to post imo

Also in college but just started buying Bitcoin a month ago, I've been buying small amounts every week but I always end up regretting I didn't buy more. 
Should I just buy a whole bitcoin when it drops a bit again or keep buying small amounts?

I've saved up quite a lot from student jobs over the years. Oh and not American, so I don't have to sell my kidneys to pay for school

Thanks for telling, it reassured me for some reason.
I too believe in the future of crypto so next I buy I'll go bigger.

Thanks, that puts it in a perspective that I haven't looked at before
