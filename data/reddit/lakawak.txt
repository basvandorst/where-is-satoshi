That's not going to happen. You are saying you can't have stability without that. But you can't have that without stability. No merchant is going to risk taking a 10%+ loss like they would have today on their sale by waiting even one day to exchange it for real money.

I don't think you understand what the word "value" means. NONE of these silly fake money have any inherent value. They are like Beanie Babies or baseball cards of the 90s. They are what people will pay for them. There is NOTHING backing them up. Not even trust. Which means it is a bubble.
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:42:09
The public does not give a fuck about ANY if them. Just like they have never given a fuck about any of the social outcast virgins who actually care about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:29:18
OF course it is. Why would anyone think that any of them would be thriving if bitcoin was down so much?
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:32:04
Oh boy! Even MORE volatility!
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:31:30
Holy crap...you really still think ANY of these made up currency are going to reach their old levels again?
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:11:54
Gold has inherent value. Bitcoin is inherent worthless.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:43:53
But it makes NO sense why Samsung would do that. You seem to be under the impression that major companies have some reason to care if bitcoin survives or not. They don't give a flying fuck. Since accepting bitcoin doesn't save them anywhere NEAR 10%, they would never do that.
As for "wouldn't be difficult for them to profit on investing in one of the bitcoin companies...WOW...you truly live in your own little world, don't you?
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:27:32
It's human intelligence. That finally enabled people to realize that something that has zero inherent value is not a good investment.
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:05:01
The dam could very well burst before that. IT is not just about mining, IT is about people who expected to be able to live off their bitcoin after getting in early. Up until now, they have been playing with house money willing to ride it out a little longer. For example..say someone had 12,000 bitcoin and they felt that after taxes are taken out, etc. they could live reasonably comfortably for the rest of their lives on $2 million. So, when the price was enough that they could cash out and still make a little over $3 million, they were willing to wait a little to see if it would go back up. But now, the price is getting to the point where they are realizing that they may not be able to retire after all. So they better sell now where they might still be able to clear $1.5 million after taxes because if they wait any longer, it might be less than $1 million. So they have reached their squeal point and are going to sell. This will, of course drive the price down even more. At that point, those who have even more..say 50,000 bitcoin, will start feeling the pinch as their squeal point is approaching. And they will sell..and so on and so on.

While your numbers are just totally off the top of your head..if they WERE right..and the price stayed the same (which it won't..it will continue to drop) then it wouldn't be a bad thing. At that rate it would pay for itself in just about 2 years. That is NOT a long time to break even. That would actually be a great investment.
But again..with the price already dropped to $180, before bouncing back a bit (which is always does before stabilizing for a few days and then dropping farther) this is a moot point because it will soon be before the price of profitability even at his $152 mark. Not to mention..the cost to mine keeps increasing while the price keeps decreasing. At the current rate, it will cost this guy $175 per coin by the summer. And by then, the price will likely be $140 or lower.
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:01:01
That is because Bitcoins are shrinking too. Your logic does NOT negate what 13onethree said. The smaller bullshit currencies are just more volatile. So, when the fake money market goes up, they go up by a bigger percent than bitcoin. And when the market as a whole goes down, they go down by more.
The problem is, bitcoin has been going steadily down for the last 13 months with no end in sight. So, of course, the more volatile ones have been shrinking faster.
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:38:39
OF course they aren't a threat to BTC. The only thing that threatens BTC is the fact that no one with a brain will ever care about BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:33:49
You DO realize that every time you purchase a good or service you are driving DOWN the price, right?
Also..are you really so ignorant as to think that these vendors have ever taken even ONE bitcoin as payment for anything/ Nope. Dell takes cash. They ALWAYS take cash. No one has ever paid for a Dell Computer with bitcoin. Nor has anyone bought anything from Microsoft with bitcoin. They buy them with cash that a middle man has converted from the bitcoins of the buyers. These companies will NEVER directly take bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:54:20
Except the demand for trucks and shovels aren't going WAYYYYY down as well. I know you desperately want to live on your fantasy planet and continue to believe that people REALLLLLLLY want bitcoin...but unfortunately for you..and all of us, where you ACTUALLY live is here on Planet Earth, in the REAL world.
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:41:28
Wow..you are still caring about 2013? Shows your desperation.
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:42:57
Bitcoin had/has nothing to offer either.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:39:43
Yeah...you don't hear much from the people who, a year ago were mocking all the realists after it fell from $1100+ to $750, by talking about how they bought at $600 so they were still way ahead. Or the people that bought after the initial drop to $700 and then were bragging at how rich they had gotten off the scaredy cats after it briefly jumped back up to $850. 
They've all gone away. Not sure if they are just afraid to post now, or if hey killed themselves when they bankrupted themselves.

It only proves that NONE of them will ever matter. For that very reason.
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:24:06
So...even though you are an somewhat of an advantage..or at least you consider yourself to be since you don't want to factor in the cost of your warehouse even though you had to pay for that at SOME point...and could be using it for some other revenue generating endeavor otherwise, the price is still going to be at a point where it is not profitable for you within a month or less. So imagine what others will feel even sooner.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:45:21
This is a man who bought bitcoins expecting to finally turn his miserable life around and now is growing more and more suicidal as he loses more and more money.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:55:40
Maybe he just finally gave up the delusion that the price was ever going to rebound and figured $300 was a hell of a lot better than what he would get say 3 months later (now)?
It is funny that you are all calling this person stupid when if it were you, you would have made MUCH less money
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:40:44
Not even close to being the same. IT would be more like BTC'ers derision of LTC = Beanie Babies holders derision of BTC
You have to have both sides of he equation be people who have worthless items.

Because oil has an inherent value.

Don't you feel dumb for this statement now? HE this person sold piecemeal, he might still have some left now..that he would be getting 30-40% less for.
I hate to tell you this because I fear it might drive you to suicide...but bitcoin is not going to be going back up. Certainly not to even the $300 level.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:41:11
Neither of those will ever happen. So you may as well say "There will be a reversal when unicorns slide down rainbows into leprechauns pot of gold and dance with mermaids.

The day you lose all your money, you will kill yourself. Not out of a sense of being por. But it will finally make you realize just how out of touch with reality you have been your whole life.
But it will be a positive thing for society nonetheless. One less welfare case to take taxpayer dollars to cover his own failures.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:41:47
Holy crap...did I say within a month you wouldn't be profitable even at your price point? Looks like I was off. Within a WEEK at this rate. Maybe even by the end of the day.
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:34:26
Where all these people that are into these coins. FAR MORE people have left cryptocurrecny (wised up) than have joined in the past year.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:07:56
What he has made in the past has nothing to do with whether or not he should continue doing this even if it is not profitable now.
Then again, the depreciation on the equipment is a sunk cost. So you shouldn't really factor that in. That is spent whether he continues or not. You could say he could sell the equipment if he got out...but that would be a complicated calculation of what he could get for it all now compared to later.
But the fact that he could use the warehouse for something else that might make more money...especially now that the price is all the way down to $180 having dropped another 10% in just the last few hours...DOES have to be factored in.
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:53:22
I love it when people say how this is an opportunity to take advantage of people's panic. As if you haven't been saying that when it went down to $600. And then again at 500. And again at 400. And again at 300.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:25:23
No they won't. Miners are still going to sell their coins ASAP. AS will merchants. If you are still expecting some utopia where you will buy something from a legit store/wrbsite with bitcoins and they hold on to them, you are simply out of your mind. There is no other way to say it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:35:42
What an asinine comparison. a cellphone's cost is less than most people consider the advantages. Most people will not recoup the initial cost of their solar panels, especially if they are just letting some of the electricity go to waste when it is more than they need. OR that they could use to recharge expensive batteries.
Now..if you factor in the massive power required to mine bitcoin..ON TOP of what they were already using...unless they are COMPLETE fucking idiots who bought way more panels than they needed (wasting money), everything you said was completely useless.

Followed by a 40-50% drop again. Just like it has happened all year. Drop by half...recover about 70%...then hold steady for a brief time...then drop 40-50%. Then recover about 70%, then drop again, etc.
