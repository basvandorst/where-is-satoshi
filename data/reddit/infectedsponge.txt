It's like the slums are in-between the suburbs... Which isn't as prevalent in the US. It happens in countries that were 3rd world then become global players. So no, not like NYC.

I did not know you could do this! That is one thing I love about cryptos is that you can buy fractional shares. I'm checking out M1 right now. 


This is my goal as of right now, but I'm also paying off student loans pretty aggressively. Lee Ioccoa said something along the lines of debt is a fire that needs to be put out immediately, so I'm taking that advice to heart. I long for the day that I have the burden of  student loans gone. I am also trying to create a future nest egg in the mean time, so it can be difficult to decide where my money should go at times.

I can understand that. My issue is capital. I've been investing in the stock market and more recently purchasing cryptos and I can't assume such a large risk, but I wish I could. I hear people say they turn a $47k profit on day trades or something on forums. It motivates me because I know how much that amount would change so many peoples lives. It must me nice to have a blanket of security when it comes to control over your money. I want to have that, but you have to be good.

Well that's pretty neat!
It really looks like if someone wants to pay off loans and invest you need to shift your focus back and forth depending on the outlook of things. It's definitely a grey area, and we're all just trying to figure out what plan works for us. 
Either way thank you for the advice!

Yeah this is the same advice I keep receiving from the older people at work. I've been shifting my focus more recently to ETFs and other mid to long term growth investments (BRK.B). It seems to be the only way to acquire real capital (though investing), it just takes time.

As if they didn't know that the Government was going to bail them out. It's all about $$ to them and they're hodling most of it. 
I'd also like to point out that not all 'older' investors contributed to the collapse of 2008.

When you see it everyday it becomes a stupid battle to fight.

Does this shit even need to be stated? If you're getting your financial solutions from the internet then you're a rookie and you need to get burned to learn.

I would love to be this stone cold.

How did he transfer that much without knowing the risk? He has got to be lying.

Send a youtube video and tell them to only invest what their comfortable losing. Usually gets me off the hook.

A single social media post involving crypto would imply you own some. 
Also ... You know the thing you're doing right now while admitting that you're attempting tax evasion.  
EDIT: Also the fact that your reddit name is the same as your twitter handle. lol typical
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:27:49
That's what I would do. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:08:57
Mostly because you don't fuck with the IRS

The risk is low but the vulnerabilities are there.
