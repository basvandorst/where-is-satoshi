I just watched them all. Its very informative.

:) BTC going strong. I would like to see updates like this also.

Words escape me. I counted 140 giving you 47Gh/s.
EDIT: I see 9 more at the end of the video now. 230 usbs @ 77Gh/s.
I am beyond impressed.  It seems like a few of those arent working as they should. I had the same problem with 4 of them not working while the other 6 in the hubs are. I fixed it by uninstalling the drivers and doing a fresh install of it. 
If they have a solid green light it means the power is on but its not mining.
You should be near 2.5BTC/day at this difficulty.

The asic revolution is in full steam. I don't think we have seen the peak of this yet. It would probably be in a few years. I wonder what will it be like when rewards for blocks half again.

Expert skin is too leathery, looks like a lizard. Expert also says no no no no way too much.

That's from TheGeneral 2:12 in the Satoshi Bible. I remember reading somewhere he will return and rapture all the believers and save them from their earthly bonds.

Hmm $777.77 a day once they reach their goal? Yes I can live on $777.77 a day for 3 months.

If we were on the gold standard $20 will still be worth 1 troy ounce of gold. At today's price of say ~$1500, $0.01 backed by gold would be worth $0.75 today's currency.
Based on that I think we would have enough money to handle the economic growth even if our money is backed by gold. The coins we use won't be a useless thing and would have actual value. Not to mention the coins themselves would be made from metals of value like copper or silver.
My real concern is the &gt;$17,000,000,000,000 debt we have and how high that number is going to go before we feel the repercussions of it. We can't continue funding all the programs we want.

Bitcoins can go down the the eight decimal 0.00000001. The max number is 21,000,000. That means there are 2,099,999,997,690,000 possible units of bitcoins. If bitcoins are being lost we'll compensate by using the decimal places.

I have a bank account. AMAA

All I do is have my wallet on the laptop. I didn't encrypt it. I don't have script blocker or tracker blocker.  I just have Windows 7 and my BTC wallet. I don't do anything with the laptop but keep my wallet in it and I lock my laptop in a safe with a fingerprint/retinal scanner/DNA scanner and I never connect it to the internet unless I absolutely need to. Nothing crazy or superhuman. I was never hacked

Sorry guys. It was me. I broke the bitcoin
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:39:23
Maybe its me!

I just used them for a large transaction. Only problem was that MoneyGram doesn't take multiple of the same transactions. Just take a penny off and make sure each transactions are different. Other then that it went smoothly. Got a confirmation within minutes and the bitcoin in less then 30 mins. Will use again.
