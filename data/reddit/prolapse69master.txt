Exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini have that capability.

Why are you against doing pain-in-the-ass work for free?

Probably Trezor because it is open source.

It will either go down then up, up then down, down then down, or up then up.

Oh so it's over 9000. That's nice.
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:40:00
That advice is only really helpful if you know beforehand it will only go down. In other words, if you can tell the future.

If you could go back in time to prevent getting caught what would you have done?
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:30:01
That was someone else. I'm just a random asshole on the internet.

Just do it. Downvotes aren't a big deal in the end. 
Fuck it, I'll downvote you for no reason.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:14:59
It's Ok. Just don't try again.

How hard is it to find 30 million people willing to throw $3k to $4k at an investment which could take years to give an ROI? Probably pretty hard.

My personal example is that the new tax law allowed me to afford sending 3 kids to daycare without my wife having to quit her job to be a stay-at-home mom after we had twins. If it didn't pass she would have had to quit her job. The tax law was incredibly beneficial to me.

Not only is he a billionaire, he has a super model wife while you only have your hand.

billionaire and 45th president of the United States. ie a winner.
@_date: 2019-12-08 22:40:31
So what you're saying is this is our last chance to buy under 10k?
@_date: 2019-12-03 05:01:23
You could call me stupid all you want, but it doesn't change the fact Trump is the president of the United States, he is a billionaire, bangs a super model, bangs porn stars, and you are the type of loser who comments in porn threads as if it would help you get laid. Sorry bub, I vote for winners only.
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:03:46
You aren't responding to my idiocy. You are responding to my facts.

He's talking to the doctors out there who currently have patients.

Who upvotes this garbage? Someone could literally hack my bank account, drain it, and the bank will reimburse me. And your rebuttal is some anecdote which ended up being resolved?
Yes, there are many problems with the current state of fiat, but it does have some distinct advantages over Bitcoin and it's ok to admit that.

Sounds like he knows how to pick winners.
