Once it worked almost instantly ;)
The occasion was quite funny and not as smooth as I would’ve hoped. I’ve had about a hundred bucks on a mobile wallet for a while now and when I found out that the Science Center accepts bitcoin I offered to pay for my brother and dad (who willingly or not are the ones hearing most about the benefits of crypto). I hyped up crypto all day the days before and was so excited. 
When I went to pay they were using BitPay as a merchant service and I tried to scan the QR code with my app but it didn‘t work. I tried for a couple minutes but it didn‘t work and as the line was getting a little longer I decided to just go for old fashion credit card. I arranged with the lady at the counter to come back later and try again and get the money refunded on my credit card if it would work. (Just imagine the look on my brother and dad‘s face - „You‘ve lost it, dude“)
Then in the museum I downloaded the BitPay app for android, sent some bitcoin   and had to wait about 15 minutes for confirmation. 
Once I went back to the counter it all went smooth as. The lady picked up an ipad and pulled out a QR code through the bitpay app, I scanned it with my bitpay app and within 5 seconds the payment was settled.
I‘m definitely interested in the BitPay app tough. I can‘t imagine that the payment can get confirmed in such quick time. Also I don‘t like that you have to use the bitpay app to make a transaction - why not use any generic wallet?
I still gotta do more research on that one.
