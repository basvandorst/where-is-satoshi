Am in Australia so maybe my data is lower. Less nodes nearby?, some folks have mentioned much higher data usage

Wrong century, maybe read some history. Plus America had far more convicts sent than oz in the day.

Why don't they display the corrupt cops stuff with it?

Most boomers were just working slaves, they also didnt have the easy information available now. What have you built for the next generation? A poison world with a new iphone every release?

Raspberry Pi here, uptime now one month, just over 300gig served. Cheap to run 24/7.

Any idea at what point a firework becomes an explosive?

I wonder how some b.ash folks feel now after publicly loling and hoping btc burnt to the ground a few days back. I must admit a bit of schadenfreude now with the burn on them.

Got a Pi3b up and running last week myself because I couldn't for the life of me get it open through VPN on a PC. Plus the extra cost of a PC running 24/7 over the few watts for the Pi. I screwed up the mounting hdd a couple of times but got there eventually after taking care to read instructions fully. I used a combo of instructions from pinode.co.uk and some from buildaminingrig.com

The BCH act is like a petulant teenager being told no to something and the ensuing self destruction. It is very obvious what is going on with the coordination.
 I would not be surprised at all if the Chinese government were to be directing the show from behind Jihans investments. It will either make BTC stronger or kill p2p crypto faith altogether, I cant see how they can come out on top in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:46:37
There are no restrictions on bitcoin only with your countries laws whatever they maybe. Work for btc maybe. Good luck

I was unsure not being full tech head, after reading both reddits and noticing malice common in bcash communication and intent, I decided to stay with Core because they are generally proffesioal in comms and actions.

Reminds me of the old joke about the builder previously known as Peter the builder, speaking with his son saying how loved he was for all the beautiful buildings he built around town but screw one goat.

Get a dremel or similar, stainless steel sheet sizes to suit and engrave the info on it, I sleep much better knowing I can sift through ashes and keep my btc.

Boomer here, tried advising millenials in family to buy btc in 2011, got called an idiot. Youth does not equal intelligence.
