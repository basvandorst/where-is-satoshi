You forgot to put a "." between 1 and 5 or you forgot to add a "0" after 5. One of those cases.
@_date: 2019-11-21 10:30:58
2 ways forward. Btc 15k by Xmas or alt season incoming.
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:25:24
Banksters gonna coin. Bitcoin that is.

Organic dumping leads to toxic waste
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:59:00
Anything below 100k is an early sale when it comes to good old BTC. Revival will be spectacular!
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:45:44
Too optimistic. 1k tops. 1M per BTC still intact though
@_date: 2019-11-28 08:06:47
20k by Xmas. Let's do this kids.

Batoms up
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:22:27
BTC has been on a bull run for over 10 years straight. Look at the chart. Just saying...
@_date: 2019-11-19 07:43:06
Good morning.
@_date: 2019-11-19 07:43:35
Hey hey hey...
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:47:42
The end is near. Doomsayers slogan for btc. Attempt 399.
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:24:12
Of course not Johnny boy. You're stating the obvious. It is the job of Batman and Superman. Everybody knows that.
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:00:15
That's also what bitcoin tells holders on its way to 3k.
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:30:58
666 would be much better!
@_date: 2019-10-06 18:24:15
This post is not going to age well. 3k incoming...
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:06:44
Sorry but 6k is gonna happen by Sunday...
@_date: 2019-10-21 17:56:28
Wait a second fellas! Isn't Craig the bucket?
@_date: 2019-10-21 18:01:42
Why call it a model, let's just call it a prophecy! This way everybody knows it's gonna happen for sure! And on that note, both feet are once again touching the ground.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:58:52
Smart girl!
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:50:38
Respect! The bitcoin network is an unscalable technological dead end and indeed a dinosaur that has zero future. But you are preaching to the cult...
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:10:51
Wait till 6k then wait some more till 3k
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:32:05
1 trillion by tomorrow!
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:58:28
1M prophecy... WINNING
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:01:26
You called it. 3k by December!
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:05:33
good thing that the bitcoin is considered as a store of value... Oh snap...
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:33:11
I like November, no year, and then 87. Could it be November 2019? Nooooooo
@_date: 2019-10-21 18:03:21
55k, dude, that's so weak. McAfee said 1M, so you know it's gonna happen!
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:30:35
Did I miss something?
@_date: 2019-10-21 17:59:43
You should've made a better one. "Your secret is safe with me".
@_date: 2019-12-10 08:00:32
10k in the air.
@_date: 2019-12-10 07:59:34
6.25. 1/2 coming soon.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:38:22
Its not that bad. 2020 is coming. Halving. New ATH to 50-100k. Sit back and relax and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:38:48
Hey hey hey
@_date: 2019-12-10 08:01:18
Hi there Sat. Good day to stack bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:46:33
I just made a prophecy in the daily section and this plot is perfectly aligned with that!
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:42:27
Here's the deal kids. T = "next block reward halving". 1 BTC @ 30k-50k during T-1 month until T+1 month period. After that gigantic, unseen, big bang alt season starts followed by a pull-back in BTC dominance to 30-40%. In short, buy now, get rich by mid 2020 and thank me later. Voila, a new BTC prophecy has been coined! You're welcome.

 It's not unusual to be loved by anyone  
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone

Are you Ned Flanders?
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:46:10
Remembering the good old days when you needed thousands of BTCs to buy just a pizza... Ah, the memories...
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:35:21
Or flamingo. Both are good animals.
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:45:10
All 0.0001 of them now? Congrats! :)
