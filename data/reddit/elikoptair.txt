Sorry but i’m a total newbie in bitcoin, i heard about bitcoin cash or core i don’t remember, are those also fork from original bitcoin ? When you say that fork are created by government what is their goal ?

If i have my bitcoin in an electrum wallet will i get those new coins from the fork ?

I hope it will reach 50,000 ! It’s true but I have heard that bitcoin is very volatile (I don’t know of it’s true or not) and if there is a crash i would regret buying bitcoin today.

A true but too simple argument, i search the argument that in a discussion can make a person think of it and when she get home don’t find this idea stupid and maybe give it a try

Hi, maybe this question is already answered but I want to understand what are the forks ? What is SegWit ? Is original Bitcoin still viable ? Thank you :) !
