Do I really have to debate that with you,probably because curbing global warming would stop them pumping out immersions,which would result in less money.
The facts are they can do what they like and put you in a cell in a prison with big Ron and at lights out big Ron may want to get close and personal,you’d have to be an idiot to want that and that’s what could happen to you if you Broke  the law.

Just hope it’s made difficult for them now to regulate crypto, and pray that in the near future they loose the battle.
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:32:46
The money laundering one is interesting,as I see it,are they not struggling with those problems their selves.
And I can’t see how they would regulate everyone who uses BTC to put their names to their public and private keys and their wallets.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:16:23
I got BTC in 2009 you would be way foolish to try arguing a case that deflation doesn’t work,as I have made plenty from deflation.
And it’s clear to this day that people want BTC as if they didn’t the price would be Zero.
If you want to elaborate please do.
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:37:31
Even if you did determine BTC had an element of bubble trouble,that has never meant that when a bubble deflates it goes to zero anyway.
Main stream media just try to portray that to scare investors away.
And clearly comparing things from the past with BTC hasn’t worked for main stream economists as they have already been proved wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:28:22
The price would drop,but increased buying by others would push the price up again.
Steady release onto the market won’t tank the price,but a dump of a large amount will.
If only a quarter of the worlds population owned a part BTC the price would be substantial.
That would be l.9 billion divided by say 17 million BTC allowing for losses and theft in circulation by the time the last are mined.
Think that’s conservative and I think that would mean that they should have a reasonable value off these figures.
But why would whales sell out.
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:11:34
He’s probably correct,especially about institutional money coming in eventually to push up the price,
The right regulation also for this to happen,and adoption,sure it’s possible maybe 5 years from now.

Within 6 months BTC and crypto will not only be regulated it will be signed sealed and delivered.
The g20 is all the worlds elite in one big room they can all agree from there how they deal with you and you half a get rich quick bitcoin that you guard with your life.
Plus your wrong about BTC being the best preforming asset as there were other stocks that did out shine BTC last year,not that bigger boy investments would enter the realms of the school or college play ground.
You can be delusional and passionate about how anti establishment you are or how much you think you can win,but they all fall in line and you will too.
Exchanges are the life blood of crypto they will bend to the rules or go out of business there is no way to say no to governments,if you do they will force you hahaha.
Marijuana and a global asset that you want to spread and make uniform in society for all to use,how the hell will that happen if you class marijuana an outlawed substance with BTC.
What head down the shops with your outlawed coins,that now have no value because they are outlawed.
Apart from the dark web where there 50 dollars each,yes that’s the way forward great economics looks like BTC has a bright future haha.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:10:03
You answered you own question when you said your hodling.
90 % of others also do.
They have this weird belief about the LN will magically making everybody spend and not hodl, and that won’t happen as LN is only a means to sent transaction, and not a means to convince you your BTC can now be spent and no value will be lost.
Argue deflation and almost anyone will walk away as the deflation argument is impossible to win,it stops adoption and is the Achilles heal of any currency.
As you see adoption is one of the greatest drivers of price increase and profit.
Your dammed if you do and almost certainly dammed if you don’t.
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:18:48
Yes a guy showed me a decentralised app  Bisq network and it looks cool.
I’ve always had a feeling that the centralised exchanges are the weak link in the chain,a way these institutions can hurt crypto.
But I have noticed that as soon as the BTC price gets so high the warning lights seem to flash for these people and they try to disrupt anyway possible. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:26:12
Bitcoin does need FOMO don’t think someone has read any of satoshi emails,how else do you think it’s going to spread?

Yes but those wounds always heal and most economists don’t believe a Great Depression scenario will happen again.

@_date: 2018-03-10 08:11:45
I’m not pro regulation or pro decentralisation, I said I would rather have a decentralised crypto but as much as people think that can happen imo that won’t happen,as the ultimate yes or no will come from the government.
Time to face facts that regulation in line with other financial tools will happen.
99% of people into crypto are in it for financial gain no matter what they say,the right regulation may increase BTC or other price dramatically.
But to say something can’t be out lawed is preposterous.
I want to be seeing an end to cash,and moving on to a crypto system but it won’t happen unless there is give and take,by both government and the crypto community.
To give you an idea of the power that governments and the g20 have let me tell you that,the US spent 6 trillion on fighting wars in the Middle East.
The above figure should show any one they have the will, and will find the money to protect what they have at any cost.
Saying they can’t do something is really silly.
Crypto will come under legislation and it needs to happen sooner rather than later so the market can mature and so the bad news talk and FUD disappears.
Regulation won’t mean an end to people being their own bank and it won’t strangle BTC if done correctly.
I’m not anti Chinese I think Asian people are trend setters and miles ahead of us,but the chinese government disgusts me as they are narrow minded and way more controlling than in the West.
I’m convinced also that since Satoshi created BTC his view on a completely decentralised unregulated token will have changed as he watches proceeding from afar,I know in many ways mine have also as BTC can become truly great but that element of regulation to put the authorities minds at ease will come,better maybe it come the easy way than be forced upon us all.
My opinion on tokens that have virtually no chance of detection like you mentioned monero ect,I think because of their nature they will be destroyed or outlawed,they will fail anti money laundering legislation and for that reason I don’t see a future for them,unless each individual registers who they are.
By that I mean all wallets addresses registered to an individual but the transaction are secret.
But at the moment there are no rules and that won’t last.
To make big money you have to have a global stage,BTC is the same,creating a coin just for a few people won’t work and it won’t have any value going forward,so anyone should clearly see there is only one way forwards.
And I’m yet to hear a solid defence how it can go totally decentralised,I presume from that there is no way it can.
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:51:14
I’ve just read it and I can’t see many things promising.
As if these people don’t mean regulate it,they mean strangle it.
Everyone in crypto should pray that sooner or later a way comes that means exchanges become decentralised in some way just in case,they do over regulate.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:18:35
Yes rather you than me,grasping dreams that would be and an insecure life and future,think you’d be on your own pal.

You can sell at a loss if things are desperate enough,as you can make the gain back into profit at a later date in a more stable market.
When your buying and selling it’s crystal ball trading and especially with crypto,no one gets it right all of the time.
Hodling can leave you with an empty bag in extreme cases.
And no one wants that bag.

@_date: 2018-03-11 12:37:40
It’s deflationary stop trying to complicate it,the number of bitcoins has been set over a set period,eventually leading to 21’million.
The price of each token is also deflationary meaning it will be worth more over time than it is today.
That means in basic terms they are immune to inflation,by that reasoning they are the opposite which is deflationary.
If you want to argue with every economist globally,who have clearly stated bitcoin won’t work as a currency because they all agree it’s deflationary be my guest,but you’ll look stupid.
(Must add I didn’t say it won’t work as a currency the economists do)
So to clear things up if any one says they lost there money in fact that’s bollocks because as long as you hold and more people invest,the higher the price goes 
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:56:57

I think there has been solid proof through the emails that he was  British by the use of word.
And a group is preposterous,the reason for that is logical, most people that looked at the coding found many faults, and an individual would make more mistakes than a group.
The coding was of an older style,which puts the person between 50 and 65.
Also there is no proof what so ever that who ever it is new any of the cryptographers or computer scientists he was in touch with on a personal basis (only email).
The US government or any other would never make a deflationary currency (period).
BTC isn’t a conspiracy,it’s just a plain guy who was disgruntled with the financial system and looked at history,from Thomas Edison’s who first proposed a system to pay farmers which was kinda bitcoinesk , and then later e cash and others.
This thing had it roots long before,but Satoshi looked and adapted it and made it work better.
The truth is anyone with the coding skills could have done it,albeit he was the only one who had found a way to fix the problems of the past.
Also remember that the original code has been changed for the better by others,think this tells you for sure it wasn’t a group.
You also wouldn’t get a group to forego the access to the vast fortune in the Satoshi wallet.
And keeping it secret would also be difficult.
He or she is extremely cleaver this shows as your all still asking the question WHO.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:55:59
Well over my head,but it shows there are many cleaver people working to make crypto better and this is great for everyone.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:13:12
I wasn’t talking about the protocol,it’s the fact that governments don’t care about that,they are not interested.
They are interested what they get and when they get it,which is enforceable time and time again and by their rules.
Your mindset is bizarre,you yourself are regulated and compartmentalised by your government already,along with everyone else from the top to the bottom.
This is done through tax and how much you’ll be paid for a certain job,how much competition they create to complete with you,there is no freedom.
Money is the key to control,your enslaved through it,never never never will they relinquish that hold over the population.
Laws control every aspect of your life period,you can break them but they can imprison you for doing so (CONTROL),they will regulate crypto so it stands to benefit them.
Nothing you have said makes me believe any different.
Now maybe they will give it the correct amount of regulation and I hope this is the case,but they can destroy it,and any denial of this is insanity.
You should take a note from your own book on looking at history,as I cannot think of any instance where authority has lost power over its monetary system in the West, forgetting recessions and depressions where alas they found ways to reboot the system even then.
They always have a way,and crypto will fall in line sooner or later.
It can barely break 10k USD because globally they are pounding it,and that’s just playing.
But you know in plain English I welcome you telling me how you think BTC and anyone linked to it can do the opposite of what any authority says?
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:07:54
At least that’s a level headed approach and a realistic view.
How exactly do or can the fed manipulate  its price,when it isn’t connected to their market.
Or do you mean through the futures trading that has been offered.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:27:53
Your an idiot,and your statement is childish and ludicrous.
The whole reason that BTC is in flux each day is because the masses in this space have not realised that regulation will come.
You seriously think you have the power,just another them not us view,and your not even realising that they always win.
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:28:15
Yes I’m not saying that’s not a good idea or that isn’t the way forward, as I hope it is.
But let’s look at that from a stand point where BTC has been outlawed, would that guy who you bought the jeep of still accept the crypto.?
I think not as that crypto wouldn’t have any value in the real world.

The guys is right also that shows the link showing almost certainly Satoshi was following British banking news at the time, there are so many things pointing to a Brit.
Very hard to not give your area of birth away if not impossible.
So if you believe this then you can write off all the other stupid theory’s .
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:47:53
Most people don’t want to get involved with something that has had the shine taken off it, I get what your saying but people work hard for their money, and investing in something that has been outlawed in a major economy would kill it imo.
People are lazy in general, plus bitcoin really isn’t very big when compared with other things.
Blockchain no doubt won’t go away that’s another issue, but you can kill bitcoin, it would just be a process of effecting the price so people lost.
@_date: 2018-03-11 09:44:25
How’s about on the power side they say ok,let’s start mining our own BTC.
We can outlaw any other through making it a criminal act unless it’s supplied by us?
Making you loose is part of making them profit,they are a business and an effective one for that reason.
Everyone is financially kept in their place, people in general are sheep,manipulated through basic phycological processes and most of the time they don’t even know it’s happened to them.
Example is checking the BTC price a thousand times a day,they would say no not me,but they’d probably be in denial.
Your example of gold and IOU isn’t the system beaten it adaption,but if government don’t want it then it won’t happen.
Kid yourself all you might,change happens with regulation.
When the Romans heard of a man spreading words they didn’t like they found that man and murdered him,that man we know as Jesus.
Any great power can do what they like period.
The best you can hope for is a rational view and an integration with what always exists.
Plain truth is why does everyone think Satoshi has never shouted his name from the roof tops,my guess is he knows he’s stirred a hornets nest and has a strong sense of self preservation.

Yes I’m not stupid, that wouldn’t mean a consensus couldn’t be reached.
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:57:21
You wouldn’t have to do that,if they voted that it was directly a challenge to the banking system stability,they can pass laws to outlaw it.
As long as all the G20 members agreed then it would be doomed.
Not being able to cash out would destine it to the bin,as the shops and online retailers also wouldn’t be able to accept it.
Once people loose confidence and think they may loose their money the game is over.
I am not anti crypto,I’ve had crypto for long time,early days,this is a experiment to see just how clearly people see the truth.
And I believe few do.
Now I know they won’t ban it and I know it will be regulated to make things fair, which is a good thing.
But to say something that challenges power can’t be banned is silly.
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:42:05
That’s good and I’m pleased for you,hopefully a bit in the bank on the way.

@_date: 2018-03-03 09:57:35
I’m not sure after looking into his comments he actually understands BTC,
I’m interested to know how this so called regulation in line with the current financial system will work (detail please).
And finally because BTC isn’t like the tradition banking system,in fact its own closed eco system in effect,is it even possible or sensible to say you can regulate inline with the normal banking rules.??
Views anyone.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:51:59
Hahah,have they got an English version,didn’t hear anywhere BTC mentioned anyway.
Blockchain as per usual,and if crypto is mentioned how does anyone know they are not talking about their own brand.
Sorry but thats not enough for me to get excited about.
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:26:40
It will be regulated or they will ban it out right,I don’t like it as much as you and I believe in decentralisation but they won’t let that happen.
Facts are they can tank the price today to zero by shutting all exchanges and forwarding a law which states it is illegal and against the state law and punishable with a minimum jail term of 20 years.
Most people don’t want to do 20years jail term.
So to believe it can’t be regulated or the government isn’t in control is delusional.
Also one guy I spoke to on here also told me how easy they can buy huge amounts of BTC and play with the BTC price at their will,always making sure they manipulate it in their own interests.
But if you have a solid reason why they can’t do the above I’d love to hear it.
As if you do go decentralised I think they would push to collapse it,BTC in Satoshi swords can only grow through price increase and FOMO.
@_date: 2018-03-10 10:53:10
Any kind of card should be regulated,you have no insurance.
You may as well pick someone one off the street to give your crypto to for safe keeping.
You can only take the risk when your money is fully insured for loss and fraud,that’s not to say it’s not a good idea because it is.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:16:17
There you go right at the end BTC can’t be banned,you were doing well till then.
Buy the way i owned BTC 2009.
The point you and everyone else is missing , apart from one really smart guy is that,of course it can be outlawed.
I admit it won’t probably and will just be regulated.
But it’s astounding to think that people are so brainwashed to believe that they couldn’t de funk all of its value very quickly.
And there are many ways,BTC is tiny really,government have trillions to buy BTC they can play all day with the price.
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:41:48

The bottom line is the bottom line,if all the news adds not value then there is no point,and it doesn’t seem too.
Bad news outside this ecosystem certainly does effect price, but in the wrong way.
So I suppose it is a bit overwhelming.
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:26:07
That would be a huge undertaking in my opinion,and how are they going to do that with Z cash and monero.?
You can find someone’s identity when they cash out for sure,but not on chain,
So I cannot see how.
I had a guy show me yesterday a wallet app that’s decentralised and if they push hard I think more people will go further decentralised and make it even harder for them.
Seems when he says bring BTC more inline,maybe he doesn’t see that maybe for the reasons above it’s already superior to their system.
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:48:34
If they wanted to protect the man on the street they wouldn’t issue credit cards and allow betting shops casinos and online gambling.
As the above are a way to in debt people they are fine.
As BTC is a challenge to them, it’s hardly about the people.
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:18:32
I’m not sure weather it will or won’t and I know there are those that like it and those that don’t.

No authority is going to stand back and say do what you like.
People in crypto will probably realise when they ramp up the ID proof side, and that will come.
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:34:19
The part your referring to is about how people who are either invested or interested in crypto, automatically believe it’s so big and powerful that no one could outlaw it.

Hahahaha I’m pissing myself laughing,this police force is useless and under funded,go report a fraud to them directly, or through actionfraud U.K..
Let me tell you generally what they will do,they will take the information and then tell you they will put it on a data base, as investigating it would take to much time and money,oh and also generally fraudsters ect are cleverer than them.
So even if they think it’s not anonymous they won’t have the funds or the capacity to investigate any potential frauds.
Basically if the perpetrator of a crime walks into the police station with his hands in the air and admits to certain crimes and then they link the crime off the data base they put your crime report on,then maybe you’ll get some luck but this is the only way you will.
They are useless.

Woah that has shocked me, I myself am very wary of getting involved with trading, as I think a loss can quickly follow that gain which either cancels any gain out or puts you at a loss.
$3000 dollar loss is shocking also as it could be multiples of that surely.
I read that in the U.K. tax is accessed on a case by case basis,I also read that a hobby trader has no tax liability.
And also that trading is more a kin to gambling where taxes are not payable.
One thing I am interested to know is,if you play crypto like a forex trade,say using BTC to buy other coins,maybe through changelly let’s say.
When the changes coins increase in value a gain has materialised,then if you change those coins back to BTC through changelly  but don’t cash into fiat, even though you have now more BTC than you started with how can you be taxed until you cash out.
As you do loose the gains when the coin drops again,so unless those coins stay stable or you cash out,mostly you always loose the gains you make.
I hope that makes sense,what are your views do you thing coin changing for profit is different.??

No I agree crypto isn’t necessarily BTC but I don’t get what would be interesting about a bank issuing crypto.

It won’t grow if it’s not used beyond speculation value,and that speculation value is what you are seeing price wise,with today’s values.
Roundabout 27 million people have BTC and most of the coins are held by a few.
BTC was far more valuable with China and India as it showed in the price,now the market has shrunk on that bad news from those regions hence the price drop.
So adoption is everything.
IMO personal opinion I don’t see it making much more that 30k uk in what ever form.
It would certainly have to have huge adoption for these crazy price prediction you here,most of which are based on nothing.
Example is LN will boost BTC but will it boost the price, well LItepay is LTCs LN and unless something dramatic happens to LTC price before Monday,LItepay will be a let down.
Innovation should add value,and I mean quality value,but I’m personally am not seeing this.
So to sum up it has limited usage without far wider adoption,and newer cryptos are coming.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:18:18
No banning bitcoin hasn’t been tried multiple times,it’s has slight regulation and outlawing in certain countries.
I personally don’t care who did the interview.
But yet again the separation you talk of won’t happen,it’s like saying we will leave Isis in control in Syria and Iraq,the point being is if the government don’t say yes then it won’t happen.
If you believe you will ever live in a world where the government isn’t in charge of the money supply in some way then I’m afraid your going to be disappointed.
Just like most people who believe in BTC as I do myself and i would like also to see it decentralised totally,I then wake up and smell the coffee.
I always say or ask exactly what would you or BTC do if unilaterally the G20 voted for a complete ban.?
I will answer it for you NOTHING because the power has spoken.

Banks do back customer deposits.
And the post is misleading as most customers don’t have a lot of savings so the banks don’t have that much to pay individually.
You’d be in a different situation with Bitcoin as it’s not secured.
As far as I know the customer has always received their money in desperate times.
You would find though that government or institution will not pay out for crypto.

They can ban it outlaw it, increase tax on every aspect of it,you can make it pay the same fees as visa or all other payment systems to make it fair.
They can do what they like.
If you don’t fall in line they can imprison you,shut exchanges or highly regulate them,
Buy up bitcoins and crash or suppress the price.
And use anti money laundering laws to stifle its adoption.
There are probably more things they could do.
Outlaw  mining.

I would say that there may be a huge truth in that,but it would be secondary to financial gain.
Believe me when I tell you this ,there is a saying and it goes like this.
Society has become so fake that the truth actually bothers people.
You see this a lot in BTC also,people hate the truth.
Wanting change in the banking system is one thing,over throwing it is school boy fantasy.
That banking system that your so disappointed with,has kept you safe because of the liquidity it has made available to governments  to fight bad people that threaten your safety and freedom.
This is not fantasy this is fact.
I personally don’t like that banking system or those people,but being a realist is what makes BTC work and bring the big financial rewards.
And until people in the community drop the revolutionary act,it will struggle or take longer.
You cannot beat the system,it will crush you like a bug.

No crypto currency is anonymous off chain.
People don’t understand that BTC or other is worthless BIT-code until it is changed into real money,and what happens when you change it into real money, is you have to give your identity to whoever is paying you.
Mainly your bank account details. 
In person maybe it is as you can just do the transaction cash.
But it is pure bullshit that it is anonymous if you go the bank account checkout route.
If BTC is used to pay for something and you have given your ID somewhere it can be traced back to you also.
Monero ZCash  and others have higher on chain anonymity but as for before if you want real money sooner or later you will have to give you real identity away.
Give it a bit of though and you soon realise you can’t hide forever.

Since being at the Bank of England Carney has done little more than any man in the street could have done,meaning lowering interest rates to zero and pumping more funny money into stocks.
He’s not even been challenged with anything with any complexity financially since his stay in the U.K.
He’s a pure idiot, and when his term at the B.O.E is up,he will disappear into another cushy,over payed job somewhere else, taking with him the easy money he’s been payed by the U.K. tax payer for doing fuck all.

Or can I export it ? Or will it come back when I download the app again after the upgrade is installed?
Hope this makes sense.

The price of a bitcoin could be stable,but I doubt it would be worth very much.
You see BTC and everyone who’s invested, are invested for greed (and by that I mean everyone no matter what they say).
So all participants will be cashing out at I guess 25 k U.K. and I state that case on the fact that people will remember the last crash and will  not want to loose their profits again.
Once this happens the price drops again.
If BTC becomes stable it won’t be a tool of speculation that you can get great rewards from, this will mean its less interesting like ripples prices are today.
The players will then leave the theatre and the game will be over.
I would be amazed if you could get a stable bitcoin at 50 K U.K. ever.

Virtually all people who buy crypto are in it for financial gain (period) cut the BS and admit this is a fact FOMO.
Same as the property market,same thing financial gain.
The problem is,speaking from a U.K. experience,when news papers like the “SUN” start advertising BTC then your in trouble,as the people who buy papers like that can barely string a sentence together never mind make an informed decision on investing money.
If you are investing in bitcoin the whole idea is to hold,and let deflation do its work.
But I agree with the articles prime concern about people whinging because BTC price has gone down,do us all a favour and sell up and FUCK OFF as it’s not for you.

Everyone into crypto is in for profit and greed,same as stocks and shares,big fish and little fish.
People who need money will always sell on mass,those that hold till Zero end up with the empty bag (always).
If say Visa card weren’t used as from tomorrow because no one used them,it wouldn’t be long before visa went bankrupt (hodling) not usage.
Personally I think BTC should be worth more today than it is and some of that’s to do with hodling and not usage.
You can’t complain about news, you have to be realistic as this is a war,and all is fair as the saying goes.
And faith my friend is for the blind,if it’s faith that places the bets  be prepared to loose.

You don’t want to debunk because you can’t if it’s based on the facts that are available.
I’m not saying my prediction will be right just more realistic.
And mine is based on what I’ve seen since early days.
Bitcoiners  all believe their own hype, this is called blind faith and you’d be surprised in its power.
Don’t get me wrong I like bitcoin and I have been in since early days and it’s been good to me.
But it hasn’t grown financially as well as a technical advance that promised to change the world.
Current price just over 7k U.K. and struggling.
I am not saying for the record it will die,as I believe it has its place but in a small way.
But just to put BTC into perspective 
BTC market cap 130b
JP Morgan market cap 404b
JP Morgan profit 2017 5.9 billion
Don’t think banks will be worried on these figures.
Plus we all know JP Morgan can and do influence country economic policy behind closed doors,that my friend is power.

I see it very clearly except for that to happen your going to have to pursued masses of people and bitcoin is a flee on a dogs back.

Doesn’t this mean that in bitcoin world all the prices of the goods will drop constantly,so why buy today what will be cheaper in the future.?
As with bitcoin today,doesn’t it only have value as it’s linked to the one thing it’s trying to replace.?
So isn’t BTC just worth beans if that supply of fiat is turned off to the bitcoin market.?

Funny thing is off subject, I think Satoshi must have though these things when he created BTC, even if it was put to the back of his mind.
The adoption, deflation problem would have given me sleepless nights.
One fights clearly the other.
Visa isn’t the best payment system and there is fraud, even though most frauds they don’t make the customer pay for.
My point is a payment system doesn’t need to be perfect,or that fast or that cheap,what it does need is mass adoption like visa.
LN can’t solve the mass adoption problem only people can,and if the people in the community won’t spend why the hell do they think others will.

He was always careful and secretive, he would of known about all these people for sure like Hal finney ect,but that doesn’t mean he knew them personally or had ever met them or wanted to meet them,apart from email correspondence with them.
I personally don’t think Satoshi is a group of people either,because 980’000 BTC up for grabs,you can be sure one or more of the group would want to access them.
That’s why I think only one person has the private key because they not been touched,it’s logical to assume this.

By my calculations that’s �� 500 years to cash out just so you don’t have any tax to pay.
And it’s not at all about don’t trade,it’s about knowing the tax laws and having a good accountant and using tax flaws to your advantage.

I get the whole on Blockchain stuff the amount and the address ect for sure,what I don’t get is that while it’s on chain crypto is worth nothing,in theory it only becomes worth something when it is converted to real world money.
At this point in time your identity is broadcast loud and clear,I mean all banks have to follow money laundering rules so they know where a payment has come from and can make the link.
I really don’t see what these people are trying to do.

Does the LN network matter?
I understand it’s purpose,but I question it’s success due to the fact that people hodl BTC and few spend.
Doesn’t the LN presume wider adoption?
How can wider adoption work if all the BTC are stored and not used?
I can only envisage one way of more people using BTC and that involves a huge price increase and people then selling percentages of BTC for profit, and that percentage going to new users.
Other wise I see it as a great product with  little use.

I’ve just had a look and I’m impressed.
So am I right in thinking it would be virtually impossible to shut down or influence?
If so why are so many still using centralised exchanges,it doesn’t make sense.
BTC is meant to be decentralised so logically it’s ecosystem should if not now, but moving forwards become so.
Big question is can you truly be supporting BTC when you choose centralised over decentralised?
IMO I don’t think you can,and I relish the thought that institution is eventually scratching its head realising there isn’t a way to regulate or ban.
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:44:34
They wouldn’t need to do anything other than regulate its price out or existence,

No doubt about it crypto exchanges  needs to go decentralised,that takes their powers away from them in some respects.
Maybe that would also make them realise that they better play nice,there is no doubt now the tech has beaten their antiquated system.
Them I means all governments and security agencies.
But you cannot do on with centralised exchanges as they are the weak link,they need to go.
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:04:36
It’s an admission that if BTC is regulated there will be more speculation from main stream investors that have kept away,also further adoption from some people who won’t invest until it is regulated.
But he’s definitely wrong saying it must be one or the other,as BTC is already working without heavy regulation, one of the reasons they want to regulate is because they know it’s working well and spreading well.
It’s not more vulnerable,that’s BS,just means it’s not the way Satoshi wanted it.
With regulation or without regulation it’s not going away and mathematically each coin will gain a higher value over time.
This clown didn’t mention that realistically in the future why would we choose paper money over crypto as paper money is already yesterday.
Lame at most is his thinking about no value,bet if you offered him a wallet full of BTC he’d snatch your hand off, argument over about value I believe.

Could do,all today though I have been trying to show some wayward minds,that government is bigger than  BTC and the crypto community.
When someone can clearly see they have the resources and the power, and that all else that would be needed is the will.
Then you have to admit so,banning or outlawing which ever name you choose is no doubt possible and do able.
I don’t believe this will happen I believe a lighter approach with regulation, but they can do what they like.
I am shocked to see today that people who own crypto don’t think their own governments have this power.

There is such irony when people like bill gates talk.
I mean couldn’t we all say that without the internet and companies like micro soft ect,that child pornography wouldn’t exist.?
Pointing out a secondary tool that is used for addiction or terrorism is a fools game, it’s not the BTC or other that’s the problem it’s the route cause. 
Addiction through drugs is the killer, same as wicked mind in terrorism is also the main tool, motivation in money laundering for profit.
It’s a pointless annoying argument that is repeated over and over, societies ills being blamed on advancement, when these ills are of societies making.
The proof is there for even a fool to see,any activity will still be there just that activity will be done through other channels and means.

I agree with one of the upper comments about him saying the same things about crypto for years.
Do think though on the kieser report he said his company accepted BTC for gold, now come on peter you either hate it or accept it has value and if you do accept it for gold then the latter applies.
Plus on the book side,let’s face it these are idiot books,because anyone who buys them is an idiot, the guys been talking about financial meltdown for nearly a decade and every event he’s predicted had passed without one iota of a problem.
Let me state one,he said as soon as the fed raise interest rates the US will be back in recession,and they are not.
You will also know that he wasn’t the only person to predict the crash of 2008 and he wasn’t the first,in fact I believe it was some woman.
He just doesn’t want trade taken away from gold (period) and even though he makes out BTC has no value,he also knows it makes more sense to a lot of people.
Do not let these people win ever.

Yes I understand quite clearly if you read what I’ve said.
You seem to miss what I’m pointing out the irony in what Carney says.
I’ve just watched a news blog of the interview,the usual talking about terrorism money laundering ect, they all happen through the banking system.
Level playing field he says,I doubt they will ever achieve that for BTC isn’t and won’t ever be linked in that way to the financial system.
Or should I say the banking system.
In fact watch it your self it’s laughable,especially when asked by the interviewer how they plan to regulate inline with the current system.
Carney gives an uneasy look and kinda skirts round any real answer.
I think it’s because they aren’t really sure how and if that can be done.

What’s been debunked?
Let me debunk your debunking for you.
“Flea on a dogs back”
23’7 million people who own bitcoin out of 7.6 billion.
And a lot of those coins are held by a few.
This is fact.��
Deflationary economies can’t work as all goods cost less tomorrow and everyone ends up unemployed,there are many other aspects but these are good enough to see it won’t work.
Nakamoto new from day zero it wouldn’t scale and that’s why their working on LN.
And that may or may not work.
Worthless without fiat,this is fact as they are magic beans without fiat,and it’s stable economic model.
BTC model and price isn’t stable,so the irony is that the thing it seeks to replace is the thing that keeps it alive.
Price over 30 k usd I doubt it, no price prediction has ever been right and the authorities don’t want blood on the streets if it dies a death.
Consumer debt can harm their economic policy and jobs.
Best guess 30k max and it has a long way to go.
So don’t give up you job at the factory just yet mr soul complex haha.
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:58:38
Yes I agree but adoption usually always will mean price increase of any worth.
And adoption will mean increased transaction traffic,so there must be some people who have left the market place.
And business isn’t actually embracing BTC yet because of cost,in fact some have left it behind for now.
Not convinced LN has taken that volume as with technical advance that works the asset price should surely rise in a well functioning market,but it hasn’t.
LN is early days though.
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:34:43
Oh I’m amazed actually one person that can have a conversation and has the intellect to see that if governments wanted-to right off crypto they could.����
As for you other point I agree and it’s very valid,I have myself used that in a previous post.
And I have more reasons probably why they won’t ban it or over regulate it.
But this experiment has shown me just how blind a lot of people are,and amazingly they still have a lame excuse.
You are at least a rational thinker bravo.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:00:47
It is easier to say regulation will kill BTC than actually doing it.
You could tax it say up to 40%,but if people pay the tax they have failed to stop it.
But it won’t happen that you get every country globally to implement a ban,as some like crypto and see a future for it.
The big issue for all of these economists and governments is,keep saying its failed and then keep coming back to spread more FUD about it in the future,shows it clearly hasn’t failed and that they clearly don’t know what they are talking about.
I think fighting back by not giving them a voice is the way forward.

No your right you can’t but what is the point in something that’s not used,eventually BTC will have to be used or it will loose its shine and people will leave.
People don’t realise that litecoin with Litepay is doing soon what bitcoin hasn’t.
All this hodling is bollocks,if you don’t think so look at the poor price of a bitcoin.
You won’t realise BTC high prices without adoption,for adoption to happen it must be spread it can only spread if people use it or let some go.
Your all hodling and something will come along and wipe it out.

How is any crypto private?
Do they mean private so you can ovoid paying tax,or private in that no one knows who you are?
The Blockchain on BTC is open to view but not linked directly to anything other than wallet addresses,that is until you cash out and your full true identity is needed.
Monero,zcash and others that promote added security are the same if you want to cash out.
I cannot see how any crypto is anonymous,as when you check out that trail leads to your full identity, through that network of transactions and your bank account.
Maybe in a on chain environment and if also there wasn’t a need to cash out anymore,and thus  not needing ultimately to give personal info.
I would like to hear others views on this.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:51:26
Thanks for that I’ve read it, one question though I’m not sure about is,if you have a transaction history and you uninstall some coin apps off the device to free up space so you can do an update,what happens to the transaction history?

Yes it’s the best thing that can happen,everyone wants to make money and more institutional investors and more stability will push price higher.
At the moment it’s just messing about,kids stuff.
Regulation doesn’t mean they own bitcoin as that’s impossible,neither does it mean you aren’t your own bank.
It means tax,stopping as much money laundering as possible,and regulation to protect investors.
You have more institutional money,and more people feeling more protected will bring more people in,and thus more money.
One huge benefit also is a more stable price, as the shite news and FUD will debate.

Oh I know and it’s always interesting to hear other views,as I’ve said I do believe in BTC and some other crypto.
I don’t think it’s perfect by a long way,and I think savvy people can make money out of this new tech.
I think if people are in it just for financial gain then maybe regulation will give them more money.
And as I say, politicians and banks more and more see this tech as a problem that isn’t going away.
That’s good and I’m pleased but I cannot see unregulated crypto working or more to the point hitting the mega bucks that most people want so badly.
They will either tank the price,once it gets to a certain level or constantly pick on the exchanges,that laughably are centralised and the weak link.

Isn’t he correct in the past tense that it has failed as a currency?
I know there is the LN to come and without getting into that debate right now,buying things with BTC is still hard.
Plus everyone is into hodling and not spending?
And where is it’s liquidity in the long term if it’s deflationary, for unforeseen events?
And what happens to BTC or other if you disconnect it from the dollar,imo it would be worth little or perhaps beans.?
Am I right in thinking it only has monetary value because it’s linked to the currency it’s trying to destroy?thats hardly a great model.

No successful trader gives away his formula of success, only an idiot would do that as your going to increase competition  and your profit will eventually disappear.
Trading algorithms are a prime example of this as there is big profits for the makers and the first users, but when you see them sold on the internet promising big returns you know there finished long ago.
Crypto trading isn’t big boy trading,it chance,but that’s not to say there isn’t money to be made.
And trading just BTC is bullshit as there are profits to be made of all coins if you buy right.����
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:35:50
This is all bullshit,every single aspect of price prediction is shite.
There is a sure pattern that when BTC gets to high in price for authority comfort , they clamp down on it hard and crash the price down.
Whales who manipulate the price internally also.
Even with some of the great news that BTC gets the price doesn’t climb like it should to reach these great heights.
My price prediction 30k U.K. max and then run for the door while you have chance.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:24:45
I doubt banks fear BTC as it’s as tiny as a flea on a large dogs back.
Its owned by a tiny majority compared to the world population.
Is deflationary by design so can never be a global currency.
Has scaling problems.
Probably will struggle to get over 30 thousand USD,and if it didn’t have a stable marked and a stable fiat currency to link its self to it would be worthless.
Banks or government only have to stop the cashing out of BTC to fiat for it to be something that’s now resigned to history.

Firstly with crypto you never trust anyone not even a bank.
Also you can get a dedicated hardware wallet like Ledger nano s that is simple to use with step by step instructions.
And because it’s offline it cannot be hacked so your funds are safe.
And if you don’t know what you are doing to that degree you really should read up first as you are asking for problems.
Banks should have nothing to do with BTC as Satoshi designed it with the people in mind,without banks and middlemen.
And this is the way it needs to be.

@_date: 2018-03-09 18:00:41
����very good,so you call for monetary revolution,that’s great I will accept that too.
But and there always is one,the governments of the world will no doubt accept this in time but yet again using their rules of regulation to game things to their advantage.
What you believe they will sit back and let the power fall to the people,the masses.
Ludicrous,you don’t look at history hard enough,if you did you see the truth.
In the future we will still have government minister who are the same,because they are chosen because they will do what’s needed.
Even the president in the US can’t make all the rules without its passed by others.
Free world monetary thinkers are dreamers.
People like me are realists.
Face the truth about yourself and all of the others that argue the other way,before Satoshi invented BTC you had done nothing,your not so radical really.
He’s given you a dream,a dream even he said won’t be an easy path.
But you or other aren’t the revolutionists,you only act like you are,he and only he was because it was his idea and he was the first.

@_date: 2018-02-22 11:09:53
Yes your correct,I’ve had these conversations with people also that cannot see any connection to fiat and the real economy.
Where in fact BTC only has value in dollar terms because it’s pegged to that dollar, and that dollar has value because it is pegged to the real world economy.
If you take BTC and place it in it own ecosystem it has no value and becomes no more than magic beans.
The BTC price also falls because there is nothing happening, it’s stuck in a speculative state.
One day rise because the market is stimulated,one day fall when the speculators cash out.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:38:27
Yes I agree and see it completely different thanthis guy.
BTC price will only rise so far on things other than use.
What hodling means is waiting for a price rise people see as worthy of their coins,the irony is there is no price that’s ever enough.
I see BTC success and large price gain like so.
The price of BTC is to low at the moment and I agree most will hold, but let’s say the technical breakthroughs and the trading speculation can take it to £30k U.K. for example, if it gets to this point I believe the only way to the next level is to use BTC as much as you can.
Make profit through speculation,save some and spend some.
I have no problem spending BTC if the prices are higher.
Holding for ever is self defeating on the eco system as it’s deflationary, and we all know what happens to deflationary economies.

Decentralised is a pass word now more than ever, people believe the hype that just because a protocol is decentralised it’s completely void of, all or any governmental interference this isn’t the case.
They can hurt or control or regulate any industry by the power vested in them.
The truth about BTC is they probably still see it as small, thus making it not such an urgent topic as what we actually believe it to be.
I think that when of if they do see a threat from it they will outlaw it or regulate it at their will.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:42:15

You won’t pay tax on something you didn’t get.
And if you had your coins in a storage device that doesn’t have access to private key(ledger nano s) they can’t make you pay tax as you couldn’t claim.
Or even if you have the private key and you didn’t claim shit coins, they still can’t make you pay tax on something you haven’t benefitted from.
And this other guys right, you only pay when cashing out and a profit is realised.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:43:16
This is probably very true as regards the manipulation point,
If you look at BTC most large rises seem to be down to only manipulation.
BTC is a tiny market also and the majority of the bitcoins are only held by a few big players.
These price predictions for bitcoin seem more blind faith than reality.
If you look before xmas when the price in U.K. was about £14k that was probably market manipulation, but as soon as the price gets to these highs the authorities start clamping down.
IMO they will never let it get to £100’000 uk that would cause mayhem if it crashed,think of the consequences.

The thing I know about most people who own BTC they have blind faith.
Bitcoin has become so fake the truth actually bothers people,
When you realise this you start to take a closer look,maybe the fog may lift for you one day.
Oh and that’s without naming at least two that can or will in the near future do much more than bitcoin,faster,more scalable,not deflationary,and much much more.

Probably less people using it,there were more transactions before xmas which drove up fees but also prices by adoption.
Seems only right that if people have cashed out and left there is probably less usage and this is showing in transactions meaning a lower BTC price overall.
Or part of lower price could be put down to this,I know there has been a lot of bad news but this can’t be ruled out.
Just a theory.

Anyone who wants into crypto and talks about banks holding their crypto,should not be in crypto,literally go away and stay in the traditional system.

If you don’t have access to the private key you can’t collect,your coins have to be in a wallet with access to the private key to collect.
I’m not an accountant but even if you do have access to claim the free coins and you choose not to,how can there be a tax liability.
I’m from U.K. and my accountant thinks that if a profit hasn’t been realised then no tax can be due.
A profit realisation surely is only taxable when you cash out.
As I understand in U.K. tax HMRC won’t let you off set a loss against a gain (which is wrong,but I can see why) so my account said he don’t see that there can be any tax liability till check out time.
Mining is a business period of course you pay all the time.
Personally all crypto trading should be gambling logically and no tax should be paid.
Also if you are deemed as a hobby trader no tax is due, that’s why they say in U.K. they will look at each case individually.
I believe stock losses can be off set, crypto is grey all over.
If I made the rules I’d simplify them and say all trading,changing and buying done inside the crypto ecosystem was non tax liable.
Upon check out any liabilities will be taxed at a certain rate, make it simple and easy for everyone.
But usually theirgreedy ass holes that love red tape,that’s why the world doesn’t function well.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:02:45
Do you know how many exchanges and bitcoin keepers have lost peoples funds?
Are you going to automatically pay all your taxes on all your BTC or other?
As that will be classed as cashing out,
If you store on your own terms you then cash out and pay tax at what rate you decide.?
You don’t have to have two accounts one crypto and one fiat at your own bank.
You can have a crypto wallet on an exchange linked to a bank account.
Or you can send funds anyways to a bank account,you don’t need a crypto wallet at a bank.
You loose your right to privacy over your funds in many ways.
So I wouldn’t sign to quickly as I would think of the consequences first.
I’d bet 90% of crypto enthusiasts wouldn’t use it as they have all that and more now.
So it will be another desperate failed attempt by another institution that has lost the race.
Also when you know something about banks they have the right for what’s called setting off,meaning they can take money from your account without your permission for varied reasons.
Also when you open a bank account in theory you are signing an agreement to let the bank lend out your money.
This is why banks have to offer you a guarantee on you deposits up to a certain amount,now it’s debatable weather in practice they would or could pay everyone out but that’s another discussion.
So I don’t think we should mix banks and BTC as BTC wasn’t meant to be associated with banks.
As for people who don’t want to be their own bank that’s simple,stay out of crypto or wait until crypto banks arrive.
As logically they are coming.

Don’t know about Belgium’s tax laws as I’m in U.K.,but does it say anywhere you can off set loses against that 33% they want.?
You will have a tax free allowance also and the price or the coin and fees to take off if you cash out,this is the final amount they can tax.
I think there maybe other territories you’ll be able to ovoid paying any tax in,just means you’ll have to take a few holidays.

The scenario just isn’t possible as it has way to many faults to work.
Deflationary aspect to it, is great for speculation but impossible to run an economy on.
Way to volatile for a currency.
And bitcoins biggest irony is it only works now because it relies on a stable market that governments have created and the currency from those markets to cash out.
Doomed to fail.

I think the post has some valid points.
The LN isn’t either the problem or the cure, all of LN success relies on usage.
I personally think hodling is a stronger force.
People believe when LN is released everyone with spend,and they wont.
Miners can survive of fees for sure but transaction volume will have to be huge,so yet again adoption is king.
And finally price rice to those kind of limits that make BTC full-proof I cannot see happening either without mast adoption.
Hodling could be BTC Achilles heal in the end.
So I think it’s not LN that will kill BTC or BTC that will kill LN, more one may kinda cancel out the other and hodling will ultimately be the thing that makes that happen.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:33:57
This is interesting as I don’t know about U.S tax law and I would like to know a bit more.
My personal opinion is that any money taxed, or any tax liabilities, should only be paid upon any monies going into an off exchange bank account.
If this is what this guy means then obviously the tax is liable.
But I don’t understand how tax liabilities can be asked for if that person hasn’t cashed out???
In this circumstance any gains made on an exchange or other speculative way of making money,can be wiped out at anytime before the gain is cashed out.
Why don’t all tax authorities world wide just simplify  the tax,to say all taxes to be paid upon exit and not until.
I believe also in the U.K. from what I have read that losses are not claimable,or off set-able against any gains.
Then when you take into account there are a few countries that have no tax liability on crypto,this makes the system unfair and I’ll though out.��

This is all bullshit and it must stop,people are reading to much into these people who could be or claim to be Satoshi,and forget all the millions more that could have created Bitcoin.
Anyone with those kind of computer skills could have done it and there are many more than the handful we always hear about, they wouldn’t have to be on a main stage as there are some extremely intelligent people out there that don’t want to be.
If you know about Thomas Edison’s take on bitcoin,and David chaum with e cash as far back as 1983,and others that have dabbled or proposed electronic cash systems.
You begin to realise it’s not unique,just worked better by this guy Satoshi.
And IMO he’s just some joe who took up a challenge and made it work.
Probably a family guy in his mid 50s to early 60s,motivated by challenge and not wealth.
Certainly not a wanna be like Craig wright.

Really I don’t think it will have that much impact on the price.
You have it the wrong way round as you clearly miss understand what Hodling is,if you did you’d realise it’s not LN that increases adoption it’s not HODLING coins that does.
LN only makes it cheaper and faster.
The reason I think your wrong also is that Litecoin on the 26th feb launches LITEPAY,
Tomorrow in fact,and that is it’s own LN sort of. Now at present that price is very low for that coin I would expect far more movement on that coin price before and after launch but it doesn’t seem to be happening at the moment.
Maybe tomorrow it may jump a lot or it may more higher over the coming month, but be sure more people actively use Litecoin as a payment tool,than do BTC.
This isn’t quantum entanglement where 2 things can be in the same place at the same time.
You either use BTC or you HODL and 90 % hodling won’t bring adoption no matter how good your network is.
Basic deflationary economics predicts no one will spend what will be worth more tomorrow and this is what you see in BTC.
This isn’t made up or anti crypto or BTC these are facts.
You mention perceived value also,and that means nothing,what matters is real tangible value.

Your talking rubbish,look at what you’ve wrote and look at some books on economics to understand how an economy works,now come on.
Most economists agree without doubt deflationary currency doesn’t and won’t work.
If price and adoption increase,”IF” and it won’t as it’s deflationary so everybody is Hodling (period).
So it more than likely won’t be used and thus the volatility will remain.
And this is why it is only useful for speculation.
You contradict what deflationary means so badly I’m laughing ��.
You really need to understand a deflationary economic model,I could sit here and slay you time and time again if you try to argue against it.
As an example the LN won’t make people spend bitcoins that could be worth thousands in weeks to come,it’s just a transaction system,they still won’t spend today what is worth more tomorrow.
So you won’t have adoption and you will keep speculative volatility.
That why BTC will be overthrown by a coin and protocol that does everything and more,without deflationary aspects.
You as a person are only safe in your bed because your government can create more money to fund wars to keep you safe,and in a deflationary economy there are no extra funds for lean times.
Try reading some books and educating yourself about money and finance.
Oh and before you dig yourself a deeper hole read this and try to understand. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:10:47
Well if you argue that governments can’t ban or stop crypto if they wanted.
What do you think the outcome would be if the outlawed use of it tomorrow?
The sentence for which would be a minimum of 15 years jail time for anyone promoting it,selling it,or transacting in it?
Firstly that would mean no more exchanges.
Secondly you’d loose future investment, all leading to a complete collapse in the price and ecosystem.
Once that is achieved all confidence would be lost and it would be no more.
They would also outlaw mining facilities,yes you could go home mining again but most would fear the prison sentence if they were to be caught.
So you see clearly they can ban it if they choose too.
But if your intelligent enough to quash any of the above with content be my guest.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:01:48
That maybe so,but it doesn’t answer the question I posed,
The reason it can’t is because no crypto of chain is anonymous,they see you and everything you do and have done financially as soon as it hits your bank account, so realistically all the smoke and mirrors before is just window dressing.
Hope you can reason with my point.
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:11:53
I will add a link that tells or informs about the hobbyist  side of trading crypto and one on the gambling aspect,I am remember talking about U.K. tax law.
There has already been a court case where one guy had a high volume of trades but was still deemed a hobbyist trader.
I will add them when I find them again,
But the guy who explained coin changing for speculation as a taxable event is probably right,but I would argue if there are no gains made it would be best not to declare it and if you did you’d be best declaring under a hobbyist banner.
All the information I have put forward is freely available on the net.
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:03:36
I’m not sure they can.
They could cut of changing to fiat,but someone would no doubt find a way round that.
And they wouldn’t be able to stop face to face trades.
They could outlaw it but that would have to be global,and it’s the Streisand effect all over.
No bans have really worked in the past,just drive it underground.
Exchanges will soon be DAPP,and if in time this happens they won’t be able to shut them down.
The main reason they probably won’t ban it is because people would loose to much,and there could in theory effect them or cause civil unrest.
If you portray yourself s to have communist laws then you must be a communist country, not one of free speech and free will,they would look bad.
That’s why you keep seeing the same faces and names calling BTC because they don’t know what to do,all they can do is try to convince people not to invest.

I don’t have or haven’t said anything about the technology,I think the same thing and have the same view.
Your dreaming of a new mind set,you’ve just mentioned all the past tech that has been created and it’s all within government regulatory frames.
Apart from the dark web and a few files sharing sites.
 But your consciously aware you don’t break the law,you fall in line.
This is my point about regulation.
You see BTC doesn’t need to exist for us to become a cashless system,so logically they will look at regulation which will be inline with other payment systems imo.
Regulatory frameworks will make currencies and commodities a fair playing field,giving one nor the other unfair advantage.
These things are enforceable by law.
And when you mention the right laws,that is of no consequence as they make them and not you,these laws they pass won’t be voted on by the general populous,they will be forced.
You’ll have to try a lot harder than a little history lesson and some future tech stuff to put forward any solid evidence that they the government cannot enforce what ever they like,when ever they choose.

If you don’t have a token like BTC all you have is a Ledger,there is a huge difference between a Ledger of sort and a proper Blockchain.
All the elements of a block chain, chain, token, and miners all need one another,
Take the token reward and the miners away and you have no consensus for security.
The Blockchain is only secure because the miners keep it so by their reward,
They themselves are guardians. 
A so called Blockchain that doesn’t have token or reward is just a data base on a computer,that no one maintains, it will be liable to attack or will fail due to lack of maintenance.
But I’m sure some computer scientist dude would have many other reasons that alas I cannot answer,but this is the basics of why you can’t have a proper Blockchain without token reward.
It’s like going to work and not getting paid sooner or later you’ll not bother.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:25:17
Yes bitcoin by design is deflationary and for this reason it can never work in a real economy as everything will be cheaper tomorrow and you also cannot create extra liquidity in the market in times of need.
So as to taking your wages,if the price is increasing and you take the money out fine.
But if you keep the money in and it goes to Zero,you may regret the move.
With BTC proven to be no more than a speculative asset at most,the chances of that price collapse are high.
As in every case it’s only what it is because  it is linked to a stable economic market and the dollar.
Without this link it is worthless,think this “grump guy “above was trying to get this over in a roundabout way.

Yes you can sell and buy back there is no denying that,as long as your sure the price is going down and not up,and your willing to pay your taxes.
But deflation is straight forward,over time it goes up,so hodling is a fine strategy for the lazy.
They still gain in the long term,we could argue it goes to zero of course,but any shrewd investor would have taken their initial investment out and if BTC then went to zero it would owe them nothing.
All my profits which are sizeable came from deflation not buying the dip.
