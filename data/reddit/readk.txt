You are equating serious thorough peer review of scientific papers to... forum posts?

I can't get past the word tipstart.

Seriously, you can't find someone to put up a website? 
You can put up your own CMS or Blog site in like 10 minutes just signing up for a service. 
You should be aiming to make it valuable first, and if it becomes valuable THEN worry about how pretty it is.

Really, no academic paper ever published by anyone has had more peer review?  :/ 
Also "peer review" usually means other people capable of similar work and similar papers - how many of the people who've reviewed Satoshi's white paper are really that capable? Not that many.

I'm not talking about peer review, I'm talking about conferences vs journals.  I support peer review.  I think computer science research does not need to be presented in person at such a cost.
So do you squeeze little personal jabs into your papers too?

As a former computer science academic, I woulds not really say that the conference format is a good thing.  Often just an excuse for people to blow research grants to travel and then pat each other on the back.  Hey good to see you again, haven't seen you since that last conference, you're awesome, no you're awesome, lets go to each others talks.  Lets do a bunch of networking, the pretense can be academics but we're really trying to just advance our careers, no lets not talk about science instead lets have a bottle of wine and get to know each other, maybe I scratch your back you scratch mine, blah blah

That site says "Tipstart your videos, docs, images, music, and apps!"
This is why people don't take this stuff seriously folks, that is not a journal.

They actually don't use Vogogo (Quadriga).
