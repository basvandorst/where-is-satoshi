Out of curiosity, can you link me to a couple of those frauds. I am a big fan of online gambling and I would love to read more into this. Was that when they found some players could see other players cards or something?
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:27:57
Yikes. That does sound pretty bad.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:40:07
Inflation also makes debt worth less... which helps poor people.

Hmmm. I currently use Bitbook for most of my gambling. Have you had any luck with any BTC casinos? Were you more of a card player or sportsbetter?
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:19:58
Hmmm isn't there a regulation in the Caribbean of online casinos and they take it really seriously?

He made an argument that inflation punishes the weak. I simply stated my case and that inflation helps, doesn't hurt, me. And I am without a doubt not rich.

I know Bovada (formerly Bodog) is legit. I have never had problems with them. Actually in all honesty I have never had any problems sports betting on any online casino.

That is a lot of money! Is there a reason you keep such a high balance with them, knowing they could take it and run? Instead of keeping just what you play with there. Unless of course... you play with that type of money!

What do you mean you are favoring Doge for the break out?
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:27:11
So I have just been getting pretty lucky lately?
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:59:51
I am a lot closer to the poverty line than to the median income line...

Are you confusing his statement of back in early human times with today's socio economic situation?
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:28:57
My debt is at a fixed rate though...
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:50:19
Once again you have just claimed it is bullshit without explaining why or linking to why he is wrong. I am not disagreeing with you, I am just hoping you would go further than saying he is wrong while sticking your fingers in your ears. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:38:40
I have a mortgage and student loans that are at a fixed rate. My military pay is tied to inflation. I love inflation because it helps my debt be worth less money. I am also pretty poor (E-4 pay grade). Why again is inflation bad for me?
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:27:16
Are you going to offer any critique of his statement? For example, explain how that statement of his is wrong...
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:36:10
I am kind of confused here. I have sent less than $100 worth of BTC on multiple occasions and not put in any transaction fees and it has gone through in less than 15 minutes every single time.
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:55:58
In 17 hours...

Because Fox is the only news agency that is ignorant on Bitcoin...

Don't be a cunt.

Boy you sure are salty today. Was your Christmas ruined when your new fedora was a size too small this morning?
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:18:00
Can you explain to me the thought process of how it is people's own fault when a company fucks up and ships a product so late it isn't even worth it and then it is broken? Imagine if any other company acted the way they have. I am surprised the motherfuckers haven't been hit with a class action or sued.

I really wish I had gotten Android devices instead of Apple when it comes to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:00:22
I had actually seen that and really liked it. My problem is I have a Laserjet printer and am having a hell of a time calibrating it to print properly.

You should just quit while you are ahead. You are just coming off as an insufferable prick who knows nothing of addiction or compassion.

Do checking accounts every give interest? I thought that was a savings account thing...

I  am usually all for a battle of snaps and wits... just not against an unarmed opponent. Good night, dipshit.

I will give that a try. Your design looks the best out of all the paper wallets that I have seen. Your holiday wallet is awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:50:23
Lol chill out.

Once I am off my phone, I will find the article, but I read some where that if you combine the 500 most powerful supercomputers on earth, they would make up about 12.6% of the hash power of the Bitcoin network. So I am assuming it would take a shit load of computing power to try and do a 51% attack.
Anyone can feel free to jump in to correct me if I misread and am waaaaay off.

Have you tried Bitbook.biz? I have only heard great things about them. They are pretty active on bitcointalk as well.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:29:12
Well I'll be damned. I had never heard of that.
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:30:08
Congrats man. You proved you are a cunt. Mission accomplished. You can go home now.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:24:45
Why can't he use them to check his balances or receive coin?
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:13:03
Checking it out now. Thank you for the suggestion.
Edit: This is just what I was looking for. Works perfect. Thank you very much!!

I have a totally free checking account with USAA. I have never had any fees on my account and they even reimburse me for outside of network ATM machines. How exactly are they still hiding those fees from me?
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:23:45
Seem pretty analogous to me... How is it not?
