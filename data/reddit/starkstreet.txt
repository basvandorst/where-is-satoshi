Only the ones who like to dress like gay guys.

Done and done. Thanks again for the heads up!

I've gotten several orders via Bitcoin/BitPay and it was super simple, thanks for helping me test it out. I'll definitely be encouraging everyone I know who uses Shopify to enable it on their stores also.

Dang, probably not unless male midriff comes back into fashion. Glad you like some of the styles though! Tell your short friends :D

Thanks for shopping!

I just activated it today so I am curious to see the process if anybody makes a purchase. So far, it's been incredibly easy. I have very little knowledge of bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general so for me to be able to set it up so easily was really great. Major shoutout to Shopify and BitPay for a simple setup.

Thanks for clarifying. Would it be accurate enough to just say that Bitcoins are an accepted method of payment on the store? 
I'm new enough to cryptocurrency that I don't understand most of the finer details.

Haha some people still only have paypal, sadly

Thanks for that! I've already had a few bitcoin orders since posting in the sub. I definitely appreciate the positive feedback and support from the community and will definitely be encouraging other stores to enable bitcoin as a payment method!

I just saw your tweet about that. Thanks so much!
