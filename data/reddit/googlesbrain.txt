You don't need a set amount. I couldn't get the ports open for outward connections but to those who have connected to me I am sharing data with them. Typically from what I can see if you've download 32mb in a session in that time you usually upload 32kb or 500mb down and 500kb up. Those aren't set, just what I'm seeing on mine. Basically if you have a broadband connection you'll be fine. I'm only getting 10mb down and everything is OK here.

If you want to use bitcoin the same way you use fiat I'm sorry to break it to you, but you've come to the party early. The rise to $1k was on the back of enthusiasts jumping in. The last wave was investors interested in making stuff for people who will arrive in the third wave. The third wave is easy to use solutions. Unfortunately, if you come in that late in the game then you aren't going to make any money. Best thing to have done was buy in as early as possible and then waited for the mass adoption and you'd have made a nice bit of cash that you could have done what you wanted with. Basically, don't put money into bitcoin that you can't afford to lose, it's not really ready for day to day business yet.

No lol. It has to download the blockchain which is about 150gb and its 5 years behind. As of this post I'm 2 years and 31 weeks behind now, estimated 45 hours remaining for download.

I think so, you can set the location for files during setup and presumably in settings menu, I imagine it helps if you use the same operating system at home and work in case there is any difference with file structure.

I'm not planning to use this wallet as my main one. I've got coinomi for that because it's a lot more practical, but my computer is on for 7 hours a day and having an extra node running helps the network.

I can't open my ports either but my client is still uploading data to those who connect to me. So yh even if you can't open the port it's still worth doing if I were u.

I can't get my ports open but I've checked the debug menu and it IS sending information back up to the other peers, I think this is helping somewhat based on what I've read.

I'm clueless about networks but does UPnP do the same thing as port forwarding?

People who sell for fiat before some crypto (hopefully bitcoin) becomes the world standard are weak! WEAK!

Giftoff let you buy vouchers which you can spend on products. The only reason we don't have low fees like in litecoin is because people like coinbase are holding up segwit deployment and other new technologies but eventually they'll be dumped. If bitcoin sticks around it'll eventually get accepted more and more and then people will get on board too. If we are looking at widespread use it'll have to go up in price too to account for the world's wealth. But yh if you're a get rich quick moron then get lost, not needed.

Take your mind off it and initialise a Bitcoin Core wallet to help the network out!

I think bitcoin price will stabilise eventually if it's destined to become a currency. It'll have to stabilise at a much higher place though to account for all the wealth in the world to be used as a currency. If it's not to become a currency then it will serve the same function as gold, itll be somewhere to put your money leading up to a periodic capitalist crisis.

@_date: 2018-01-17 19:59:56
Well if it became the de facto currency where on earth are all the rich people gonna put their money if there isn't enough bitcoin :P? (I mean money, not wealth).

Ethereum costs ten times less than bitcoin to send and bitcoin is helluva lot slower too. The cheapest and fastest transactions were on litecoin for me, instant. But I guess litecoin has a lot less traffic.

Bitcoin is not the new gold, its following stock prices. Everytime the Dow crashes so are cryptos and then they rise together.

Ethereum is holding up a lot better, bitcoin was at its current price Nov 19 but Ethereum has only fell to December price, more than double it's Nov 19 price.
