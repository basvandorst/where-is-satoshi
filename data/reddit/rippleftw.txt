Ive sold things on craigslist for a discount if they pay in crypto. Had one person pay in LTC and multiple people say they thought it was cool for offering that. Also got one Coinbase referral!

Hardly. I bet you could look through his post history and see him complaining about how he lost  potential gains from having too much of his portfolio in alts rather than going btc heavy.

An enlightened 2018... &lt;3 ohh how we can dream 
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:09:21
It sounds like your issues are with coinbase, not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:08:56
YEAHHH LETS DO IT THEN!
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:48:09
Not too shabby! What is your plan now? Have you been trading crypto at all since 2013?
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:59:29
Even if you had bought it at the ATH right before the last two forks you still would have made great profits by now. Yeah, there would have been plenty of times where your investment was in the red but if you are in this for the long haul you might as well just go for it. There is no reason it wont continue to go up before &amp; after the fork this month. Then after that its smooth sailing (IMO) in the near future. 
Dont forget, you are asking the most biased crowd around when it comes to a question like that ;)

You think that guy owns any BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:25:24
Sign up for GDAX then transfer your Fiat of choice to the exchange. Youll avoid most Tx fees this way. 
As others have said, you will be limited to the amount you can purchase at first, but they bump up your limits over time. 
You could also try LocalBitcoins or try to find a BTC ATM.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:38:48
Well it seems to have worked out for you as of right now! 
Are you inclined to get back into mining or even just acquiring more crypto in the near future?
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:11:48
Give it a couple days. TA is pointing towards new ATHs after this correction is done.

Yeah thats more than likely not going to be worth your time for mining. However, I am by no means a mining expert and it might be worth your time reaching out to somebody who is. 
If you have some extra time and money, I would recommend you do some research on the current state of crypto as a whole. Right now might not be the best entry point if you are looking to buy back in, but things will likely be a bit more stable at the end of the month. Don't count yourself out just yet, there is still plenty of room for this market to grow. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:46:48
Only invest with what you can survive losing 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:58:06
Almost as hard as holding alts as BTC goes berserk 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:34:33
If BTC was the same price It was when I started crypto, then I've made enough profits to get into the 21 btc club. Unfortunately thats nothing close to what the entry fee is today.

Depends on the country. More than likely though.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:15:56
I personally believe we wont see a crash over -25% until USDT fails...Then, if we are lucky, we will see crashes similar to BTC in its infancy &amp; this will likely also be the reason the bubble pops. However, for the time being, there is too much money at play. Just like said, "Currently bitcoin gets more press in a day than it got in a year back then". After BTC surpassed 6k, an immense amount of institutional investments began flooding in &amp; I don't see signs of this slowing down even after 2x. We are at a turning point in the crypto scene &amp; we should all be happy to be right here, right now.

Did you see how much volume flooded into btc before the fork? This is entirely to be expected, maybe just a little bit early since we hit block 491,407 earlier than anticipated.
