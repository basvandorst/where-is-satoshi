fees are very low right now on the bitcoin network and users are moving balances from regular addresses to segwit addresses cheaply.  this will decrease stress on the network moving forward.

Gemini has NOT implemented segwit OR batching.  They are segwit "ready", but they are not using it.
best exchanges to consider using over Coinbase: Bitstamp, HitBTC, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, and QuadrigaCX all have segwit and batching deployed.
other alternatives with either Segwit OR batching deployed: Bitfinex, Bitonic, Bittrex, Poloniex, and even Shapeshift are better for the network.

No, not with nLockTime.  I am suggesting this would be from a trusted member of the community that would have a public algo for the payout amount and would payout miners 1/2/3 months after activation.  I would suggest collecting donations up until a certain date so that miners aren't encouraged to hold out even longer.

i take it there isn't a way to exclude false signalling.  could we look at blocks mined with segwit rather than signal days and use that for the payout weight?
why do you feel we need to discourage more hashing power?  i've always had the opposite impression.  is that a centralization issue to you?

Great write up.  Could you/someone else add evidence to support your section "Lies about segwit"?  If we are going to ever end this debate, this evidence needs to be available to average users.
Lies about segwit:
* Someone can steal your segwit coins.
* Segwit isn’t a real increase and will take ages to take advantage off. Wrong, all wallets are ready and as soon as it’s activated it will be a big increase (~2.1MB throughput)
* Technical debt.
* It’s untested, it’s not, it’s the most tested feature in Bitcoin in recent hisotry before a release. Companies have been actively testing since May 2016.
* It needs to be a hard fork to work properly.

Segwit was a done deal due to UASF.  The majority of the bitcoin community does not want S2X.  Miners and a few businesses are already too powerful.  Why should we give them more power?  Because they had a closed door meeting?  Is that what you think bitcoin is all about?

@_date: 2017-09-27 13:12:03
running a 0.15 full node helps.  we should also try to help reduce the fud and misinformation being spread by 2xers and their shills.  it really isn't difficult to do as they do not possess sound reasoning.  however, it is a time sink.  we also need people to put their money where their mouth is by not using 2xers services and instead find services that are openly against the NYA.
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:58:20
because s2x supporters will cause a large disruption to bitcoin and the network will take sometime to resolve itself.  additionally, most of us want to split our s2x coins to trade them for more bitcoin.  however, since s2x does not have replay protection, whenever you move your bitcoin s2x may move with it.  guides will pop up showing users how to split their bitcoin and s2x safely after the fork.  it is difficult to say what that process is right now as the s2x code is a mess and their developer is sweating bullets.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:41:48
litecoin is great, but i do not think this is how it would go down.  i suspect a majority of the core developers would fork off bitcoin and support like they currently support bitcoin core.  forking bitcoin would encourage bitcoin users to follow.  this is one reason why there isn't a lot of sell side pressure leading up to the 2x attack.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:46:07
localbitcoins is the only one on that list that hasn't publicly showed their intentions, but historically speaking, they tend to support the safest option.  also, here was their stance on the BCH fork: 
they also appear to consider S2X an air-drop here: 
maybe their founder can chime in if he has a moment. paging @_date: 2017-10-01 00:04:06
you should use a wallet where you control your own keys.  something like electrum, bitcoin core, samurai wallet, or mycelium.  you may be able to split off your s2x to sell / convert to bitcoin, but wait for trusted guides and be very careful.  because they are not using relay protection by default in barrycoin, it will be more difficult to split your coin than it was with the bcash fork.

90% did not.  Also, miners controlling significantly more than 10% of bitcoin's mining power have publicly stated that they will not support S2X.  Together, these two points shows that S2X isn't likely to have 90%+ of bitcoin's hashing power.

they all folded and signed NYA because segwit was already a done deal due to UASF.  they did not want segwit as it hurts their profits / weakens their control over the network.  most UASFers knew that their movement would force miners to accept segwit.  the NYA was a miner &amp; corporate last ditch effort to squeeze as much control as they could out of their loss.  segwit2x will fail and will make the bitcoin community even stronger than before as we unite against greed and centralization.
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:56:23
