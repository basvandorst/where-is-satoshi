The Federal Reserve is trying to create inflation by printing more money, but its failing because as the graph you posted shows the m1 velocity is dropping like a rock and with it goes down the price of commodities such as oil and gold.
this is a perfect example of how printing more money does not lead to price inflation if velocity is dropping.
when was the last time [credit destroyed] &gt; [credit created] was true? since 2002 the stock of money is always growing, meaning there is constantly more credit created than credit destroyed.

currently the bitcoin network performs a 67 bit bruteforce every 10 minutes (on average).

it doesn't matter if its 50 million or 50 dollars the point is that no one can stop you from sending that money for whatever reason, no one can freeze your bitcoin account, you are completely in control of your money.
ask the people whose banks in Cyprus stole their money how that regulated fiat thing worked out for them.
they don't have to exchange all the bitcoin into fiat right away, they can do it using small amounts over a long time, or they could buy things directly with bitcoin.
we have a system where moving large amounts of money is scrutinized because world governments have become police states and consider your money to actually be theirs.
bitcoin's irrevocable nature does not make it bad for moving large amounts of money, its not hard at all to make sure you entered the correct address and amount when sending significant sums of money, and the anonymity and security from confiscation more than make up for it.

welcome to super honest money, even better than gold in this regard.
banks could try to create fractional reserve off blockchain bitcoins though.

you're assuming the current fantasy stock market is sustainable.
with the S&amp;P 500 trading at a PE ratio of 20.52 and the Russell 2000 trading at a PE ratio of 89.27 its clear to anyone who isn't completely delusional that this is a huge bubble that will eventually explode.
the historical growth rate you're talking about happened in an era of more or less honest money that was at least somewhat backed by gold and when people had savings.
you think there's going to be 7% real annual growth with today's insane zero to negative interest rates and piles of debt policy? because if you do i got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you...

the deflation currently experienced by the economy is not because of increased production (more goods chasing the same amount of money) which is what bitcoin enthusiasts adore.
but because the money printing caused a distorted capital structure - alot of businesses that would not have been created in a free market interest rate are created and then go broke, when they go broke they stop wasting resources and thus demand and prices drop.
interest rates at 0 mean something because under the current system central banks always try to reinflate the bubble after the bust happens, the way they do it is by lowering interest rates.
but its not possible for the interest rate to go below 0 (if you get paid to take a loan everyone will take an infinite sum of money as a loan and the whole system will go into hyperinflation).
which is why 0 interest rates is the end of the road for the current monetary system.

the address checksum has 4 bytes.
the probability that a mistyped address is accepted as being valid is 1 in 2^32, that is, approximately 1 in 4.29 billion.
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:54:35
a simple typo of what? the address has a checksum, if you write a typo it won't send the bitcoins.
use a popular bitcoin wallet like electrum, there is essentially zero chance of a coding error screwing your simple transaction up, you have more chance of dying in a car accident, you should probably worry about that first.

yesterday i've sent some bitcoins to someone can you find the transaction? would you know it was me even if you saw it?

Palladium is a physical metal and has different properties than gold.
Litecoin has almost the exact same properties as Bitcoin minus the adoption and powerful mining network. 
Theres no reason why anyone would choose to use it and not Bitcoin.

buy a trezor and your bitcoins are both useful and about as secure as the codes needed to launch a nuclear strike.

If anyone told me three years ago the Bank of England would publish research papers on Bitcoin i would tell them they are completely mad.
just look how far we've come to change the world
@_date: 2015-03-13 00:35:37
not if you want to send the money anonymously and without having a banker deciding if your allowed to send it or not.
I'd rather double check the address and properly verify the identity of the party i'm transacting with.
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:12:30
a 50 million dollar transfer that nothing in the world could stop, i fucking love it.
@_date: 2015-03-14 16:53:53
sure, after the government sets a negative interest rate on deposits everyone suddenly wants out.
i bet that before that happened if you told them they are better off being their own bank and that the government would eventually rob them if they keep using the regulated banking system they would laugh and say that would never happen.

DO NOT, i repeat: DO NOT hold your bitcoins on any wallet to which you don't exclusively own the private keys.
1. download Tails 1.3 from 
2. burn it on a CD/DVD or USB flash drive.
3. boot from said CD/DVD/USB.
it comes with a bitcoin wallet called electrum.
when you run electrum it will give you 12 words to memorize, you can restore your wallet using these words if you forget them your bitcoins are gone, NEVER SHARE THEM WITH ANYONE OR THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR BITCOIN!
move your bitcoins to the electrum wallet, that way no one can move your money without your consent.
thank me in a year or two when someone hacks Coinbase.

there is no need for this.
Bitcoin can scale to the VISA transaction volume with some optimizations, mostly by doing bulk verification of ECDSA sigs and pruning.

That game should accept bitcoin

Consider the fact that people buy everything with credit and pay a huge interest rate instead of just saving and buying with cash and avoiding the interest.
people have a time preference, they want stuff now, even if its possible to get it cheaper in the future.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:59:07
maybe they will sponsor the development of bitcoind like they do with linux
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:13:59
Bitcoin is more anonymous than a credit card, all the other party sees is a bunch of numbers representing my public key.
With bitcoin i know for sure no one can overcharge me or steal my credit card number if the other party gets hacked and stores it unencrypted on the web server.
these things are worth enough to me to pay a bit extra due to fiat-&gt;btc conversion fees

silkroad was selling more than just cocaine.
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:22:13
like you said, silkroad sanitized the link between customer and pusher thus reducing the number of people with guns involved.
if they won't have the interest of the client in mind when producing the product no one will buy their stuff because the reviews would be bad.
i believe the silkroad reduced the cartel's profits because it allowed small local producers without distribution networks to sell directly to retail clients thus posing competition for the cartels.

no one is forcing you to use bitcoin, go ahead and do a wire transfer if you want the regulation, bitcoin gives you options.
i had several instances where my local bank canceled my wire transfer for no apparent reason, i had to call the bank wait on the phone then wait until they checked whats wrong and only then did they finally do it, my life would be alot easier if the other party simply accepted bitcoin.
you make it sound as if calling the person your sending the money to and verifying the address is impossibly hard, truth is that even if your doing a wire transfer you should do this anyway.
that's like saying no one should drive a car because systems are not perfectly designed and people screw up, crash, and get themselves killed.
by the way you should probably know that not every wire transfer can be reversed, so if you got scammed and only realized it after a few days there's a good chance your money is gone.
@_date: 2015-03-13 01:31:02
but you just said nothing on the blockchain is ever anonymous, and yet here i am, anonymous and sending money to anonymous 2 without anyone knowing.
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:43:55
why not, this is easier than signing up and using Facebook which the average user does with no problem.
this may be an overkill for most stuff, but when it comes to money i personally think people should be educated from the start how to protect themselves properly.
after Bitstamp got hacked no one is safe, not even Coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 01:59:37

good, maybe the banks will go back to their proper roles of mediation between lenders and borrowers.
instead of printing money out of thin air to make loans.
