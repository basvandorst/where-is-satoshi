Venmo would probably be easier.

How so?

He makes it seem like one nefarious actor can overtake the network by investing millions of dollars into mining equipment and blames the transaction backlog on a spam attack. He also neglects to mention that china implemented new regulations.

Tell that to Blockstream. Ver's vision is more closely aligned with Satoshi's

There wouldn't be a hardfork risk if core increased the block size to 2MB already

Try bitsquare, or travel to a first world country and use localbitcoins

There's a fine print rule that says if the deadline occurs on a weekend it extend to Monday

I wish bisq was used more

1800 if yes, 800 if no
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:36:38
I agree

The size increase from segwit is too little too late
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:37:14
That attitude is why we're in a stalemate. There should be a block size increase and Segwit

A lot of people end up loosing coins because of paper wallets, not because they loose the keys but because they end up using them wrong

That comment by Michael Lee is absolutely ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:08:56
I'm not saying we have to accept BU, just a block size increase 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:58:50
You guys are acting like sanders supporters during the primaries

Is a 2MB block increase too much to ask for?
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:25:33
This is a below average quality post. Relating an ETF disapproval with an opposing force you don't like without evidence of any correlation of the two.
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:16:29
Dude, for the millionth time, the size increase from Segwit too small. There should be at least a 2MB size increase

Not that I know of. I feel you though, I'm waiting on a juicy tax return....

If you read up on Jamie Dimon's role you would understand that his foresight allowed his company to be unaffected by the toxic mortgages. The US government literally coerced him into buying Bear Stearns. If J.P. Morgan wasn't able to do that as a company both Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns would have went under making the financial crises much worse.

Note I'm a newcomer myself, happy to be a part of the ride finally.

Nah, I'm waiting to get my W2 then file. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:44:32
Coinbase or localbitcoins

$2,400.01 Thx btw
@_date: 2016-11-10 23:50:00
Honestly though this guy would be very good for the position. You don't need an antiestablishment person to run treasury. If it wasn't for Jamie Dimon the 2008 crisis would have been much worse.

This shit happens to me. I'll buy some Bitcoin then 30 minutes later they email me saying they reverse my transaction or some bullshit
@_date: 2017-04-02 08:58:56
Focus on Bitcoin, Blue is taking us over now

What flags? we've been keeping the same orange for a long time
