Shh don't talk about ETH.  The actual rational human beings will leave us for it.

Id argue that Bitcoin is GREAT for the US Dollar at a time where superpower China would love to assert there brand of currency on the world.  Very timely, Bitcoin coming along toward the end of market cycle and emergence of Chinas 1 belt 1 road looking to plug themselves into their own supply chains. 
My tinfoil hat is that Bitcoin is a coordinated hedge against a potential binary geopolitics monetary system (which favors US).  But BTC was never the end game, far from it.

TheDAO is just one DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) of many on the Ethereum network - that failed to cap their token creation resulting in TOO much Eth in one place, in conjunction with rushed, (unfortunately) poorly written code - this code was not formally reviewed by the Ethereum foundation.
So there is nothing fundamentally wrong with smart contracts. They just need to be written more, smartly. And the same for DAOs, they need to be created more wisely.
I think this is a big win for Ethereum, now that there is so much exposure and more importantly consideration to smart contracts and blockchain 2.0 tech.
Rootstock will not benefit from the synergy of Dapps that will occur on top of the Ethereum network.  When Dapps start informing each other, than theres going to be a lot of new magic happening.

Where you from?

You have an excellent imagination my good friend.

Well with the current leadership we are being set back socially, in my opinion.  (but what do i really know whats going on behind the scenes.  Maybe Trump is a US clandestine operative many years in the making to sort of \*assume\* all the dirty work that needs to be done to balance with the East)
But, I dont know if you live in the US, but we are very resilant and essentially good people with good ideals.  I think this will eventually triumph.  There is not many people in the US like Trump.  Thats why many voted for him.  Im sure most people are not as manipulative as Putin either. (only the whole im sure they are \*good\* people) I hope the same triumph for our friends in China and Russia.  But there too the current leadership is setting all of us back, socially and geopolitically.

Anything else I should be aware of?
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:42:40
Look at China and Russia geographically.  Are they totally surrounded by 2 oceans like the United States?  Are they surrounded by allies like the United States?
I wish the people of China and Russia very well and over course all the people of the world.  We should wish everyone prosperity esp Mexicans, S. Americans and young white Americans as well.  
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:52:53
We had a good run. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:18:45
Thats an interesting concept.
Decentralization definitely clashes hard with the overwhelmingly centralized governance in China
Id argue more general purpose blockchains beyond SOV would be more harmful to China bc citizens can wholely bypass the State through a decentralized financial system (that really can only be built on a general purpose blockchain)

I am more excited about Ethereum and all the futuristic sorts of projects over there.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:00:19
Yes but this analogy largely points *past* Bitcoin to dynamic turing complete platforms like EOS, Cardano, Neo, Qtum, and of course, Ethereum.

I am just looking to find a place to have a friendly discussion about the potential interactions and future relationship between bitcoin and ethereum.  I imagine the conversations might start out bit quarrelsome.  But I think it important to hash things out...so both parties can grow and communicate together.  I know you want more particulars of my opinion but I prefer to just be the establisher of the forum and to loosely moderate. Maybe this is naive and it wont get off the ground.  I appreciate your insight.  Feel free to post something there or you may disregard it.  Best to you.
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:25:13
For some reason IBtimes took this down.  I imagine that maybe it's for the DEVCON1 announcement...
Search under Google news 'ethereum'

I apologize. I got a little carless in mt enthusiasm. Just want 'the consensus' to give you a good answer. I deleted after 20 minutes. Im a bit rusty on reddit. Been here for over 4 years and should have known better. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:57:01
Got to embrace Ethereum my friend.  There is no denying it is part of the Bitcoin future.
@_date: 2015-10-07 03:36:57
I am totally sincere in my attempting to bridge the discussion between Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum.  Of course, I am partial to Ethereum because I am invested mostly *as a developer* of DApps.
 
 I am finding that interactions between both communities have been *childish* and there needs to be a serious discussion about the future of both.  
I am not going to go into specifics here as to why they are linked..this is for the discussion at BTC2ETH.  I have no other agenda but to provide a forum where we can bring to light the many applications and interactions of these sister bcs- to find common ground and share constructive insights. Come be a moderator and make sure everyone is playing fair.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:58:19
I didn't realize just how delusional this community is until now.  
(Ps Rootstock uses Ethereum tech - the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)

You should respect Vinay. This guy has been involved in cryptography before you were conceived in all likelihood.  One of the original cipherpunks.  Respect man, respect.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:59:11
Good point but what happens in times when there is no access to your wallet --- for long periods of time?
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:45:56
What if the merchant does not have an Internet connection?
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:04:13
I don't think we are thinking outside the box enough here. I'm not saying i have the answer but the a collective mind probably does.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:05:25
:) ha!
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:02:59
Are you content with this as a short term investment if 'something' happens?
I am asking to dig deeper and think a way to bridege that gap to make BTC STRONGER for the long haul.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:56:20
I am merely addressing the instability of connection. You a right though. But is there a way to make a BITCOIN purely physical.  The bitcoin is virtual gold in itself. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:41:52
Thank you for correcting me there but is everybody happy with the potential for a monetary device to be lost in intangiblity. This should be addressed thoroughly if it already has not. Where is the bridge and how does BTC exist outside interconnectivity?
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:35:34
Yes, this needs to be addressed. A currency must have a bridge to a purely physical method of access and use. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:45:02
I appreciate that :)
Hope more join...though I have to go to work to make the currency now ;)
Hope to see lots more comments on this!  Xo twig
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:52:59
We must separate comparisons to other monetary devices. Bitcoin is a new viable device that needs not comparison to visa or mastercard.
Yes though credit cards are flawed this way and thanks for leading us to that.
