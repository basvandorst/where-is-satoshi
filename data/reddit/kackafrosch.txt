The joke had some mistakes. I must be like this:
A dad asked his bitcoin hodling son..
..for $10.00 of bitcoin currency.
Son: $9.67? What do you need $10.32 for?

This link shows you the current BTC Mempool. It is helpfull to get more information about transaction fees:
Currently BTC is only usefull for large transactions. I hope they fix it soon.. it's a big issue at the moment.
BCH CURRENTLY has advantages regarding transaction fee.

One thing to remember: Why wouldn't they mine for themselves ? Why do they split the profit with you? Seems they are very nice guys.

It depends on your transaction fee. If you set it too low, then it is typical at the moment. there are nearly 200.000 transactions pending and each block has 1MB

Just an example. I use my BCH (airdrop) to buy altcoins and BTC

I think it is much lower if you ignore the BTC/USDT markets at coinmarketcap.

Bitcoin has no leader. It is the leader :)
