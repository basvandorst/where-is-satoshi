Within the microcosm of Bitcoin, yes.
You're ignoring the fact that there is a wide, wide world of sports out there, and that Bitcoin, *even in a worst case scenario*, will only ever have 21,000,000 whole-units available.
What is going to happen to the purchasing power of Mr. Whale when he dumps millions of BTC? What would be his goal? Would this help others accumulate BTC to hold against real-world items like milk, or other fiat currencies?
I'm not saying it won't have an impact, it most certainly would.
I'm saying the two scenarios aren't apples to apples. They are wildly different in their outcomes once a time factor and other markets are taken into account.

Not much different than the current distributions, then.
Imagine if we lose 18 million btc to bad wallet practices and we have to survive on 3 million.
3,000,000btc = 300,000,000,000,000 Satoshis. (3MM btc = 3T Satoshi, and there are 1,000mSats per Sat...)

That liquidity will be absorbed into the market and distributed.
Then instead of having a 21MM market with an 18/3 split, we'll have a 21MM market with a, say 15/6 split.
This is a wildly different scenario compared to going from a 21MM market with an 18/3 split to a 23MM market with a 19.8/3.2 split.

The gold standard effectively ended in 1933-1935 when the Prez signed Executive Order 6102 requiring all significant quantities of privately held gold be exchanged for USD @ 20/oz and then turned around and changed the rate to 35/oz.
In the years that followed the US Gov accumulated a very large portion of world gold reserves through currency manipulation. Once they had managed that - well, the rest is quite the read.

They're already squeezed. Look at corporate debt structures and how they've changed since 2011 when the stock-buybacks started.
Look at Dominos Pizza, or Phillip Morris, or Sirius Radio, or Brinker's International, etc.
All examples of companies that have leveraged via debt to afford their buybacks and dividends. They've simply been used by management teams to funnel money to shareholders.
These companies will not be able to maintain their debt covenants / interest coverage ratios at the new interest rates quoted by the Fed. They will be in technical default on a large amount of variable APR debt, and won't be able to secure new financing for maturing fixed debts.
This is all as it is supposed to be.

As I understand it - Above a certain threshold, yes. Below a certain threshold it increases the btu carrying capacity of air. I.e. 0% humidity carries less heat than 50% humidity, but 100% humidity will deteriorate the equipment.
The great thing about this is the asics can be in a different room. Exhaust ASICs into a large air collector, move that air through a radiator, and either exhaust to atmosphere or recycle the air. The ASICs can only run at a fraction of their usual power if recycling air, though, depending on the temperature of the water / coolant medium.

Why limit yourself? Just use whatever's convenient at the time based on the Coin's value.
Right now Bits are probably the best bet to discuss real prices in a functional capacity.
Set BTC = $10,000
Bitcoin = 1 = $10,000
Bitcent = 0.01 = $100
[Milli]( = 0.0010 = $10
Bit = 0.0000 0100 = $0.01
Sat = 0.0000 0001 = $0.0001

Acceptance appears on the uptick.

Smart contracts will supplant traditional equity, debt, and other financial instruments for the most part, all enforced by the underlying network.
Why not have an options contract that can settle on a predetermined date automatically without need for an exchange? ;)

Sunoco is good for high-octane race fuel, like 105/110.
In the USA almost all 87 to 93 octane gasoline is fungible.
All diesel is exactly the same between stations, too.
Usually the only real difference is storage quality / water contamination.
I prefer Shell, personally and for no real reason, although I'll usually just stop at whatever the newest looking station is as they probably have decent tanks and pumps.

That isn't cooking, it is warming.
Cooking a lot of foods, esp. meat, requires certain internal temperatures to be attained lest everybody die of foodborne illness.
Even so, the recommended hot holding temp is around 60C/140F.
You could probably hit 60C+ if you ran nothing but S9's at near max temps.
Edit: I apologize if I come off rude, I have been in the restaurant industry for five years now and temps are super important.

I think you're off.
Set BTC = $10,000USD
$10,000 / 1,000,000 = $0.01
500 * $0.01 = $5

No, you'll never cook food with an ASIC.
The max exhaust temp I measure is usually an even split between ambient and chip temps, i.e. 20C intake, 70C chip, 45-50C exhaust.
It's not possible to cook food at 50C / 122F, no matter how much volume you put through it or how many btu @ 50C you make.
Source: I build systems to use the heat output from the ASICs in a productive fashion, usually hybridized with other commercial pursuits.
