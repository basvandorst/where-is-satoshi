I appreciate the upvote. 
If BCH values to nothing, it would hardly affect me. I would still be at a profit. I'm an icecream store, last year I had 12 bitcoin customers. If I lost 12 customers payments it would hardly affect me. The exposure from posts like these and in newspapers brings me customers. The exposure from this brings people to the store because they find out about it. Hardly anyone comes just because of the BCH feature.
Put simply, it's marketing. And it bloody works.

Thanks mate! I will be changing them next year. I don't use BitPay to calculate my pricing etc, it was just easier for the media to put it like that!
Thanks for the offer though, I do appreciate it.

Of course, BTC and BCH.

PEOPLE are the market. If people want it, that's a market. People want it.

Yes it is. Thats awesome! I didn't even know they talked about it. Cheers!

I completely agree with what you're saying. I'm not a fool, yet many others are. If the market wants it, I will deliver. There are many BCH advocates in NZ, as there are BTC. I accept both forms of payment. If it brings customers, I will do it, despite my beliefs on the matter.

Not really, 'dude' considering I'm accepting Bitcoin.

That's fine, although there are plenty of people that are specifically only coming out to my shop so they can pay in BCH. Also, being the only vendor in New Zealand to accept both forms of payment, I don't think there are many other options.

We open on the 10th of November!

Considering I have reached the front page of the local newspaper for my 'proof of work', I definitely can fool people into doing so.  I do have in fact have a concept of decentralisation and network security but I also prize my skills in marketing and business strategy. I'm not a fan of BCH myself, but if you don't meet the market, where will my business be?

Cheers! I had 12 customers but it was great for marketing! Thats awesome - flick me a message if you need a hand with setting up.
