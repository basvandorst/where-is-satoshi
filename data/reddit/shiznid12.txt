In my current state, i'm unable to use GDAX but am able to use Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:50:35
High fees?
$1.25 for a 500 dollar purchase...
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:53:31
What states is Gemini not allowed in? I literally only use Gemini because GDAX isn't allowed in mine.

Two weeks before the BCH fork prices barely fluctuated.
Two weeks before the S2X fork prices have increased hundreds of dollars.
This tells us nothing...

Glad I bought more at 5800 and 5500 before the jump right back to 6k.. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:08:02
+1 Gemini..
Buy order went through at 5500 :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:13:41
So are you saying....... now is the time to sell? Or buy like everyone else lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:54:57
Takes money to make money. Someone with a billion could invest in BTC at any point and wind up with a "crazy amount of money". Either way, profit is profit. Why kick yourself for something you can't change? Investing now is better than not investing at all, assuming the price goes to 75k. Unfortunately, we weren't all around during that time, nor had the money to spend then. Bitcoin is blowing up because people know bitcoin is blowing up. Most people who invested at $500 would have sold at $1500 or $2000. Very few have held this long when being invested for so long.

Everyone is buying, and there is no bitcoin for sale. Look at the GDAX graph.... lol says something.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:52:37
Some exchanges claim to keep your MONEY in FDIC banks.
I'm assuming you mean don't keep crypto on exchanges?
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:16:08
What if you live in Wyoming, Hawaii, or Minnesota where GDAX is not allowed?
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:28:47
It says bitcoin transactions do no charge fees.
Clearly false, but when you're buying a property the few dollars in fees is minor. It's when buying, say, coffee that the fees are too much.

Let's assume i'm ok with the transaction cost...
Is there anyway to mitigate the cost of transferring to a personal wallet? My initial transaction cost me approximately 20% of my invested value to send to my wallet (I'm certain this is due to a low transaction amount). Is there a way to adjust wallet transfer fee on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:21:00
That's one mindset.
Why do people adjust the size/speed on their transactions to mitigate the fee? Why not get it processed as quickly as possible because you can? Seems like a negligible amount of money right? But people want to do things in a cost effective manner. Why would I use Coinbase, who charges $30 more per bitcoin, as well as some relatively high fees, when I could use something else? That is the point of this post. If, say, bitcoin becomes stable around the 6300 mark (doubtful) and I decided to sell my bitcoin, wouldn't it be nice to come out even as opposed to losing money due to the fee for buying, the fee for transferring to my wallet, and the fee for spending? All of that adds up, and on 1 BTC, which I pay 75$ to purchase, I may lose another 75$ between the other fees and cost myself a pretty penny when I could have actually just had more bitcoin.

You would think. I can buy on coinbase, etc.. But I cannot even login on gdax because my region is not supported. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:33:42
Welcome to my world buddy, just dealt with this a few days ago.
Gemini.com is your friend.
$1.25 fee for every $500 purchased, free withdrawals to wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:46:40
Fair enough, just seems there are better options out there. I also didn't acknowledge that on Coinbase, you also sell $30 below value as well.
Other exchanges may have certain cons, and I think I know the cons of Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:54:30
What if you live in a state that GDAX does no support? I can buy on coinbase, but I cann't use gdax because it knows where I live.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:46:11
I'll have to figure out how to do that I guess ;)
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:26:58
I prefer not being nickel and dimed to DEATH if possible. Regardless of potential profits, I don't enjoy paying more than I NEED to. 
Not to mention, if I want to buy an entire bitcoin, why would I want to pay 30 dollars more than the "current value"? Doesn't seem logical to begin with.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:49:05
I wish Gemini allowed more than $500 a day so I didn't have to DCA. I wasn't able to get enough into my account to buy bigger when it was $5500, and if I buy now it's clearly higher... wish I didn't have to show my face at the bank for a wire transfer lol
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:28:44
Correct. I can purchase bitcoin with a debit card/bank account, however I have no way to avoid fees to create buy/sell orders. I also, due to the state I live in, cannot set up a "USD Wallet" to quickly make purchases from. So I am allowed to use coinbase, but I cannot use any of their features that allow them to "store my money" or something?
That being the case, what is the smartest way to buy coin/transfer coin to my wallet/sell coin? I feel like there has to be a better option than coinbase, but maybe i'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:18:40
Transactions fees are based on bytes, not amount of coins.
You could transfer 100 bitcoin, and it could be the same size as .00001 bitcoin. It all depends on the number of inputs and such.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:33:25
Perfect, thanks. What is the fee for transferring to my personal wallet? I feel like Coinbase raped me there as well, as you don't have the ability to choose your fee on there?
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:26:42
Sure it isn't, except if 1 BTC is $6,000.... On Coinbase, i'm going to pay $6,030 per bitcoin with a fee of $75 so we'll call that $6,105.
That same 1 BTC on GDAX would be $6,000 and on Gemini would be $6,015.
It seems that people, when investing/sinking money into bitcoin, seem to forget the value of a dollar.
There is a reason that coupons exist, because it makes sense to be cost effective. Apparently i'm in the minority here ;)
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:30:18
I'm quite certain it tells you what the fee will be. I just sent BTC from Coinbase, approximately $300 worth, and the fee was 0.00059874 which it told me when approving the transfer.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:32:52
Wyoming, Minnesota, Hawaii do not allow the use of GDAX. I can use Coinbase fine, but I believe these three states have some specific laws about fund transitions or something similar to holding people's funds and exchanging them. They may not have licensing here.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:19:19
GDAX is also not available in my state, and I don't even live in Canada! :'(
