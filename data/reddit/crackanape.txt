If you've always been in this system of slow checks and expensive wire transfers, you don't realize how limiting it is.
I'm living in Europe and it's very nice to be able to instantly pay a friend back a debt. Borrowed €20 from someone at dinner because I forgot my wallet? As soon as I get home I can pop on the tablet and in 30 seconds the money is back in their account.
It's also great for small businesses, contractors, and anyone else who needs to send or receive money.
Plumber comes to my house, I can pay him while he's standing there and nobody has to mess with cash. He doesn't need to carry any special equipment, just be able to tell me his account number. He doesn't have to worry about bounced checks or waiting for Visa/MasterCard to get him the money, and I don't have to deal with the idiocy of balancing a checkbook.

One thing you don't do is store it in a bank that's vastly overextended in a country that doesn't have the financial means to support that bank (e.g., Laiki in Cyprus).
You have a substantial degree of control over the risk you expose yourself to, and people who banked with Laiki chose poorly. Of course, some of them are widows and orphans without the means to do that sort of basic research, but they were largely protected by the €100,000 deal.

First of all, you now have a lot of very angry Adolfo Quinones fans to answer to. The disc isn't broken, it just happens to contain the 1984 crossover masterpiece "Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo". 


In the case of Beanie Baby Beans, by which this began, the beans, of which there be billions, behave like bits of bitcoins because they are similarly bountiful. 
The brother who brought up the beany baby bean example did so solely to attack the argument that finite supply necessarily creates value. You can bring up anything else you want, but it will be a nonsequitur.
Bitcoins can't be divided smaller than satoshis without disruptive protocol and software changes, and likewise if we needed to — and it may come to this — we can distribute beany baby bean slicers when deflation has finally caught up with us. It's about as convenient as toting around a microgram scale to deal with gold shavings.

You're right of course, but I've been in his position (well, not exactly, but you know what I mean). When you're frantically trying to solve the problem, and you know every second counts, any other task, however small, seems like a huge distraction.
This poor guy has hundreds of thousands of euros at stake — maybe more — and he's desperately crawling through millions of transactions to figure out what happened and how to make it right without pissing off too many people.
If he rolls everything back to before the problem, everyone's mad because the price of bitcoins has changed so much in the interim.
If he selectively backs out the corrupted transactions, it has cascading effects throughout everything that happened since. Say I lost 10 coins on a duplicated transaction. After that, I kept trading. All my subsequent trades would have gone differently if I had that extra capital. And the amount I could have affected the market would have changed the behavior of other traders too. How to resolve this? Do I get back the original amount? Do I get it back multiplied by my portfolio's growth factor in the time since the loss? Something else?

When someone says you made it up, you can simply mention that it was on the front page of the Financial Times. 


Tell us how you can read people wonderfully but weren't able to reassure your own colleagues about the veracity of a news story that's been all over the press before they bum-rushed you out of the room.

And that won't be anything like what they have on Wall Street. Extremely performance-focused custom-designed equipment with a network architecture optimized for minimum network latency.

There's a simple, well-documented API (documented here -  when the site is up). You can write any program you like to use it and display or act on the information. There's nothing to "get", you just read the API docs and write your program.

It doesn't say that one guy lost 6000, it says that 6000 left the site's hot wallet. That is, various people used the "withdraw" function to transfer 6000 bit coins from bitcoin-24 to their wallets elsewhere. This in itself is nothing odd.
