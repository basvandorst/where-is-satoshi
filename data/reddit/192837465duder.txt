What is "this new evidence" you're talking about? This dude being convicted and getting a movie deal has nothing to do with the Ulbright trial, as they didn't use Power's testimony or evidence in that trial.

The trial that Ulbright was convicted in was based off of evidence obtained by the FBI, which had it's own independent and concurrent investigation as the Dea agent was doing this. There are issues with that trial too, such as how they located the servers, which has been kind of brushed aside.

My understanding: There is a finite number of bitcoins that are available. This maximum number will be reached in a number of decades. 
Once the maximum number has been reached, the total number of bitcoins will inevitably begin to fall. This is due to people losing their passwords, dying without an heir, or whatever other circumstance. Furthermore, there is a limit on how divisible Bitcoins are, the smallest unit being a satoshi. There cannot be fractions of a satoshi. 
My question: How is Bitcoin sustainable in the ultra-long-term when at some unknown future date there simply will not be enough of them to be usable in society? This is to say, at some date there may be not enough satoshis/fractions of bitcoin for all people to use as a currency. Even if this problem is so far into the future that it is not practical to speak of it, I would like to explore this issue. 
Another consideration: The smallest unit of bitcoin may at some date, due to the inevitably declining amount of bitcoin, become worth too much for the currency to be usable. E.g. if a car were be valued at one penny in USD, how would we pay for a gallon of milk (assume we cannot divide the penny into fractions of pennies)?

Thank you for your answer. 
What are the implications for the bitcoin that is held at the time of a hard fork? Especially regarding the verification of transactions and price/value volatility? 
My research is leaving me confused. Basically it would mean that everyone has to update their software?
