Trump and Sessions are corrupt too
She and her cabal still have a tremendous amount of power
There are bigger crimes they are going after.
You logic is ridiculous.  By your logic you can't believe Trump is guilty of anything since he hasn't been charged with anything.   
There a two types of people today.  Those that have realized and come to terms with the fact that the corporate media is literally a propaganda tool for the establishment and those that still haven't figured that out.   All of your points are coming from the media.  You have been shown by numerous people that the media will blatantly lie to you yet you still believe them.  You are defending someone who had SAP level classified programs on a private server and your only defense is that she must be innocent because she hasn't been charged.

I support the wall.   It is the Dems that have chosen no wall over Dreamers.  It was the democrats that didn't pass the bill.

Zooming out shows a very typical bubble.  We would be at the point in the graph where we are about to crash.   I'm not saying this is going to happen. I'm just pointing out that zooming out doesn't necessarily show a positive outcome.  I'm still hodling though.  I've come to the point that I care more about the technology and its potential than I do the price.

Why don't you take 2 minutes and actually think about what you just said.   You are literally brainwashed.

The government shut down because the Dems chose to support illegal immigrants over American citizens,  Period.   They did this knowing a shutdown would happen.  This allowed the press and social media like Twitter to label the shut down Trump Shutdown to try and remove support from Trump.  Trump supporters see right through this.

Having a new Reddit account says nothing about how long he/she has been investing.   That tag is meaningless and designed to give less credence to otherwise knowledgeable people.  It is the same thing as the Twitter blue check.

With Coinbase the weekly limit to sell is 10,000.   If it was to go to 1,000,000 how would you cash that out?  How much would you lose in taxes?  Do other exchanges have the same limits and fees?

If bitcoin has a 50/50 chance if going belly up because of a fork, maybe bitcoin doesn't deserve all the attention it is getting.   I am new to all of this so let me ask a question. Are you saying that there is a 50/50 chance that everyone who has bitcoin will lose all their money?  
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:19:04
Can you point me towards some info on that?    The economist just came out with a very negative article about bitcoin.
