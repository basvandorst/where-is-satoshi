I think it's obvious that my chances with the fucked up banks, at this point in time, than in bitcoin. Besides that, do you use bitcoin exclusively?

Dude I like your style. You are amazingly talented at expressing yourself, and you show tremendous insight. 10/10 would kiss ass again.

Who exactly agrees on the rate of inflation...?

Has it really been productive at all in changing the role of the us government? I don't think so
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:05:46
I feel like the people who you're talking with are very naïve. 
"Why would an organization in control of people harm their citizens??" 
Do we really need to answer that? Let's open our history books.

Good luck with that. You're the one who wants bitcoin to catch on, I'm happy not living in the global citizen utopia, relying on coders like you to make sure my money doesn't become pointless.
@_date: 2014-06-10 01:25:59
So who came up with the rate originally?
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:35:43
It's just hard for people like me to take bitcoin seriously whenever there are discussions like this.

Political change has "clearly happened"? Can you elaborate? To me, someone being elected to congress who is in some way involved with the liberty movement does not count. It seems to me that libertarian ideals are somewhat of a national buzz these days, and lots of republican politicians stand to benefit from the movement, especially among younger voters.  Also, I asked how productive it is, not how many people hear about it and think it sounds cool. Finally, I don't mean to sound short, I simply lack your stamina, I'm typing on a smartphone.

There's some things you just can't change, dude. Why would you think that it's possible to achieve political change and completely overhaul the united states government using mechanics that were designed to keep it the way it is??
@_date: 2014-05-25 03:17:40
What if it isn't more productive? What if it's more productive to use your efforts elsewhere?
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:13:43
Fair enough hehe. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:51:02
Cryptocurrency cryptocurrency. Are you people on drugs? What about what you just wrote seems in any way accessible to the majority of the world? How many people with average iq's are going to go through the trouble of learning about this, especially when it's something foreign and at face value, unnecessary?
@_date: 2014-05-25 02:45:21
Can you explain that a little...? What makes you think electing someone to congress will give this guy a voice?
@_date: 2014-06-07 23:00:26
That's because I pay attention to history...
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:02:40
I'm not trying to be difficult here, but what exactly qualified satoshi to create all this? Only curious.
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:07:51
Because they lined up 100 citizens and shot them in the back of the fucking head, and told the rest to shut the fuck up and do what they were told. If you don't listen, it happens again. So on, and so on, until someone even bigger stops them, and then the rescuer proceeds to force his ideals on the populace. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:03:29
You're right, yelling nonsense about "the market" is more than naïve. The market that you're talking about consists (partially) of rich, cunning, and incredibly selfish people who observe how said market operates, and set out to bend it to their will. 
The market is not a force of its own. It's a name used to cut logical corners and make things much more simple than they really are.

"LOL they only house arrested him for 30 years! The man wasn't trying to keep Galileo down! He had his *house*!"

What are you even arguing about, fuckface?
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:24:54
Great job repeating what he said. So what has all this popularity for the liberty movement produced??

"I feel like the smart people will fix my problems for me. They have, like, code... and stuff. Every idea works if there's enough smart people!"
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe bitcoin is inherently flawed, and that in order to fix it, you might need to ruin the original concept of bitcoin?

Dude that shit happens all the time... It's been happening for thousands of years. Genocide in Serbia? Kentucky State? The fucking holocaust? Government and police, including the military, have been using lethal force as a political tool for as long as they have existed. Some people seem to think laws or oversight are going to prevent that. They never will.
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:35:05
Ha! I saw a need :P

...Booted off the network? Am I the only one who sees the massive problem there? Who decides who they can and can not boot, on a case by case basis?

Assuming so. :I
