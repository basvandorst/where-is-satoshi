Although I largely agree with the article. 'ASIC Resistance' is also a term when designing an authentication system.  Password hashes should use PBKDF2 or bcrypt to make it more difficult to crack with an ASIC or FPGA or GPU.  The point is that this term has a cryptographic purpose outside of a blockchain design.

[The Dollar's current inflation rate is 1.7% annually.](  If you aren't getting 1.7% in interest from your investment,  you are loosing value.  A savings account though my big bank gives 0.95% APY,  which is a guaranteed loss.

Bitcoin is a system created for individuals to store money within a digital wallet, and make reliable financial transactions using math, and the internet.  Bitcoin has allowed for the creation of global peer-to-peer banking system  with a fraction of the fees associated with current commercial banking infrastructure.

A simple premise: "BitCoin Opens Doors"
Show opening the door to a casino and the wonders of [bitcoin gaming]( 
Then show opening the door on a luxury home on the beach. BitCoin makes it [easier to purchasing luxury items in foreign countries](
American Express might be "Everywhere you want to be." But BitCoin goes places that other's can't.

It is possible to watch a video without agreeing - but when you start slinging around pejoratives it shows that you have a very narrow view on the world around you.

Do you have any writings or videos of intelligent people sharing their ideas? Do you explore new views on humanity and politics?  Just calling someone a retard doesn't help spread any ideas.

No, it will take a lot more than a stable payment system to help.  The comments was more that a country-agnostic currency will be much more important to our society in the years to come.

What about asbestos?  Or Cleveland's river fire?  I'm currently in the 3rd world, and there is "less regulation" - but there is also just trash everywhere most buildings are made of asbestos, and wild dogs control the streets at night. 
If less regulation means not having an EPA, then I think we can all agree this is a deadly mistake.

Transactions don't need to be encrypted to be secure - and the FCC's mandate doesn't prevent the transmission of singed transactions.  As long as you are buying pizza, and not heroin or moon rocks I think it can be public without anyone caring too much.

I like your ideas.  One problem see is that not every device that can contain a backdoor has firmware,  and this proposed solution might not work for Firewalk or Cottonmouth,  which replaces the RJ45 jack and the USB plug respectively.
However, these hardware backdoors will have different power consumption requirements.  These are just hardware parasites that feed off of the energy on the system,  and maybe that could be a method of detection.

It is a reasonable concern, however the legitimate uses are growing so fast, and there are powerful advocates for the adoption of bitcoin.
The days of any small group of people stopping bitcoin have passed, weather they be legislators or hackers, not even fractures within the community (BU) can stop this momentum. Solving the Byzantine general's problem is too important to humanity.

A good example of windows malware that was common before bitcoin is both [agobot]( and [phatbot]( Before bitcoin provided a reliable way to cash out, malware like agobot would silently extract credit card number used on the machine, or to generate traffic for DDoS extortion.
We should all expect even more news for bitcoin ransomware, as someone who studies malware i think this trend is just warming up.  Bad news is still good news, because it spreads knowledge about an important technology.
