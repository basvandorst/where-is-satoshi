I like to buy BTC in round numbers.  It should do as suggested above, but give the option to round up a bit.

It's standard practice for software and equipment vendors to offer 'bells and whistles' on top of of a standard, thus differentiating themselves in the market place.  Is there any way the perfect competition can be broken, whilst technically adhering to existing rules etc?

When claiming your BCH from Bitcoin Core wallet don't forget to check your 'change addresses'. When I came to sweep keys into a wallet, the key that I thought had money in it was spent. Initially I thought I had lost that, but then I found I could use 'listaddressgroupings' on the debug console to list the change addresses, and then look those addresses up in  I found that some of the change addresses hadn't been spent on the BCH chain, and I was able to dump their respective private keys and sweep them.

An interesting proposition.  With a TEMPORARY blocksize reduction, what are your projected timescales for LN adoption?  It could be quite risky though,  what if LN wasn't adopted fast enough to offset the rising fees?

By Layer 2 do you mean VPN?  If so, doesnt this undermine the peer to peer nature of Blockchain in the firstplace?
