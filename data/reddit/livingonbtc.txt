I knew I couldn't be the only one, I'm excited to join the ranks and am down for beers!

Thanks, I'll need it :p
For sure! Will let you know once I hit the ground :)

No, they are hosted externally. You too can run a full node via Amazon EC2, Digital Ocean or another VPS provider. 
If you are not technical, a small 7$ a month payment can cover the costs of a full bitcoin node which via

Dad? Is that you?

I will be publishing full financials to help others :) I will most definitely be traveling all through beautiful Laos!
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:34:13
I will neither confirm nor deny these charges!

Visa is a synch! Get multi day 90 day tourist visa, extend at 90 days for extra 30 days, go to laos after 30 days and visit embasy then come back and do it all over again when your next 90 days is up :)

Thanks! I have come to realise that many users in are here purely to bring others down.

I love adventure :) I actually represented my state in LBG fishing when I was younger haha I plan on getting into fly fishing and have started talking with a mate about getting a new fly rod made up. I will be moving down to Hua-Hin or Cha-am at the end of monsoon season and will head to Chumpon for diving regularly. 
Thanks for the recommendation, I have added it to my notebook.
I ride motobikes and if there is one thing I don't understand, it's people riding without a helmet. Or even worse, an unbuckled one!!
@_date: 2014-05-13 15:58:47
Thank you! As do I haha

After reading so many blogs on it, I knew everyone couldn't just be fluking it :p
Yeah, to be honest I lied and I don't have the appt yet and that is just the prices I'm seeing. I'm most concerned about the appt which is why I booked a room at iSanook for the first month while I scope things out to make sure I don't get fucked over.
What is your ultimate advice for a newby getting started?
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:04:44
Agreed, the islands around Thailand are some of the most beautiful places in the world and prices are easily affordable without selling a kidney ha
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:36:33
Ah you are correct on the 180 in total, I added them together twice whoops lol
Thanks for the info, that's the first proper post I have seen apart from forum rumours! I have been investigating a student visa but I do not want to be locked down in Thailand for an entire semester so it may be a blessing in disguise as I will be forced to constantly relocate!
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:28:03
It's very simple, do a google search on sentiment analysis, there are many companies that provide it as a service. Get all the relevant bitcoin sites and scrape them (Most have rss feeds) and hook it to something like push.io/pushover to get notifications on the go. You can extend on this to alter your trade prices.
@_date: 2014-05-13 14:31:52
Great work mate! I have heard many people report that 1k is easily doable in Thailand (And comfortable to boot)! I highly doubt i'll be hitting my budget limit, it's feel very comforting for that to be validated ha!
That's awesome! Personally, I think that if BTC is going to really take off anywhere, it's going to be South America or SEA so it's very exciting to see photos like that!
In regards to your comment on BTC-2-Fiat with other backpackers, were they selling the BTC or buying them?
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:01:38
I stopped mining a long time ago though I do run a few full nodes.
@_date: 2014-05-13 14:56:16
I will most likely just do a multi entry tourist visa, unless you have a plane ticket to leave Thailand, you will not be granted a visa on arrival and you MUST apply and receive your visa before arriving. 
The fee is around 75USD for a double entry 90 day visa which can be extended for 30 days each time so you may extend at 90 days, leave at 120 days for visa run, come back and do it all over again :)

Seems like their database has borked because all trades are missing for now :(
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:32:54
I was aware of it a few days after the paper was released and started to take part in mining a few days after the pizza was bought.
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:40:07
:D I'm erring on the side of caution!
It is the year of Bitcoin, take risks!
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:56:44
I have heard of you guys but I wonder what happens with charge backs?
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:22:37
Yeah, I have heard of that but I find it hard to believe. I think they are just trying to keep out some of the typical farangs that they don't even want (sex tourists). I've not heard any report from any non-forum post that mentions any issues with the full visa but touch wood it stays that way!
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:51:02
The real question here is how many times will I have to run naked from a hotel because I realise just before it's too late that the girl is actually a guy!
@_date: 2014-05-13 14:05:38
Certainly, some things will be sacrificed while other things will greatly improve. My deluxe serviced appt in BKK is 500$ a month which is what I pay per week currently. Though I can't lie and call it a first world country.
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:55:27
It's more a publicised experiment to show others that it's entirely possible to a small % of their holdings to live O/S without sacrificing on quality of life :)
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:40:54
Would I? I'm a programmer with a large bank of international contacts. I could get a pity job overnight and a solid one within a week.
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:27:02
Not sure if "Aliice" in the comments is trolling or serious :/
@_date: 2014-05-13 14:34:26
I will be using a mix of LBC and bank accounts with visa / mastercards. Western Union if worst comes to worst. Hopefully as the months progress, my evangelistic nature will rub off on local retailers and they will begin to adopt Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-05-13 14:53:03
This is just another quirk of modern english and does in fact mean that I am reliant on Bitcoin :)
