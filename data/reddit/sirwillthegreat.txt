Ahh I see what you did here, you used your exquisite logic and reasoning to call me a "mouth breather". You sir are the prime example of why we need a system that allows grown ups to speak and children to go outside play.

I would say a good place to start is to call the cable company and disconnect it and make a trip to your local library and get a card. Second I would check out a few TED talk videos find a topic you like and research it for its validity and get to the point where you can effectively explain it to someone else. Same process would work with documentaries ie documentaryaddict.com, topdocumentaryfilms.com, documentarystorm.com.

BTC-e is not hard to use but it is hard to get USD directly to it. Your absoulute best bet is to get a coinbase account, verify a bank, buy then transfer BTC to BTC-e then you can buy altcoins but as for purchasing bitcoins directly with USD... good luck is all I have to say. Hoped the info helped.

I hear your argument but having an open door to donate is still better then just stealing.
