Opened a margin at 17k USD, set a stop loss at 19800 USD.
Well the price started to bleed at 19600, which didn't worry me at the time, until it eventually properly crashed, saw the biggest - in my trading 'career', I was properly shook.
Lesson: always set a stop loss above your entry point as soon as you see green... been waiting for that order to turn green for 30 days now

Anyone having trouble with bitfinex like me:
Convert to LTC, withdrawal gets completed within an hour then
That being said I've just sold 90% of my BTC holdings, don't wanna deal with the (eventual) skullfuck to come with futures
Been a good run though

The prospect of wall street pumping btc now to make double the money by shorting it via futures seems like a very plausible one to me, so eh. Too risky to keep going after several days of 10-20% pumps

part of me hopes this bubble bursts and takes you down into the abyss with it, so all of you euphoric sheep fall flat on your faces
but the other part of me also bought bitcoins...
