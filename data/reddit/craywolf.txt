If the Neo supports the static password (sounds like it does), and if you can get the output of it into the password field of your wallet app, then sure.
I'm not sure if that requires specific NFC or YubiKey support in the app, though.

It looks like your "other post" was deleted. I see it in your comment history but not on this page. Same with your comment in another submission that linked to the deleted one.

It's loading for me. But based on the warning you got:


Seems like they either just set up Cloudflare (a CDN and DDoS protection platform), or made a change to their existing Cloudflare service, and it took a minute for their SSL settings to update.
Up to you if you want to trust it. If you don't have a login for the site, and therefore no cookies or password to steal, it's probably fine to continue. But of course the safe option is to just wait until they fix whatever's going on.

YubiKey has a mode where it just spits out a static password (same password every time). You could use that as part of your wallet password.
I think it would make it impossible to enter on a phone app, but if you're not concerned with that, it should be fine.

I made a transfer to Coinbase a couple of days ago from a checking account that's had no deposits, withdrawals, or other activity for a couple of years. My bank hasn't called yet, but the transaction just showed up as pending on their site today.
I also made a deposit into the account of exactly the same amount, though, so it might not trigger any warnings.
