The 170 BTC has now been split into multiple smaller wallets, a lot of which have been used before, unlike the 1000 btc addresses.

When you fire up your miner, you log in with "username.workername"

Added to coinmap. I am not a brick and mortar est yet. Run the business out of my house, but with an apt you can order electronics from me, and have it delivered and setup usually within a couple days.
