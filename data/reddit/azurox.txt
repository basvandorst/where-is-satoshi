i have one more final nail in the coffin for why i hate that exchange which i neglected to mention when i made that comment because i hadn't yet worked out how much the loss was.
 You can only buy/sell btc at a price fixed by them which is regularly updated. I checked this many times so it wasn't a one time error or a failure to update from the website. The price to buy is always over 18000 ARS greater than their selling price. That ammounts to between 900 and 1000 dollars of difference. If that is a common practice for btc exchanges then i don't want any part in them.

I'd like to ask what is, in your opinion, a good exchange to trade bitcoin from abroad. I live in argentina and am currently using ripio, an argentinian based wallet, and it is awful. Maybe i just can't tell well because i'm inexperienced but i've grown to dislike this site a lot. Their fees are rather high, their support staff takes ages to respond (it's been three days) and they only allow you to trade in btc. Whatever advice you have is welcome.

 I've also got USD and Euros. I mean, it is my hope like most on this sub that bitcoin will eventually overtake fiat, but until then I need a way to feed myself. I just told this as a sort of bitcoin success story (although it isn't much of a success to beat the Argentinian peso). I juat thought this sub might find it interesting.

 I can't tell you and I din't know that anyone can. Most of what I hear is speculation about currency manipulation from &lt;insert political boogeyman here&gt;. I guess time will tell what the fuck's going on.

 Ajajajajaj I'm argentinian and I hadn't even noticed. God damn, that's just the cherry on top of this stupid fucking article.

 My "data structures and algorithms" teacher got us to do a blockchain as a class project.
 We were also learning AVL trees at the time, so each block stored the state of a tree after a "transaction", either adding, removing or searching for data. It was really simple since there was only one user to keep track of (our own tree).
 Still though, it's what got me started, I learnt about hashing and PoW and that was enough to get me started down the rabbit hole.

 It's not that bad. I had maybe two or three good laughs (yes, my standards have been considerably lowered). Fractional reserve chickens really got me.

To be fair, if the explanation is highly technical people who don't know much about tech won't ubderstand. You should try to explain it in more layman terms.

 Just walk a couple blocks and you'll probably find a couple quarters laying around somewhere. Ought to be enough to buy you a couple hundred bitcoins early on, plus a snack in case you got hungry walking around.

 Yes, we welcome this entry into the book of technical truths.

 As an argentinian, I'm just happy we were included.

Maybe it could be that during dec-jan the number of people getting into crypto spiked?
