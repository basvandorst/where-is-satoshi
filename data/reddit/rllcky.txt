I've sold a few guns privately. Here in Texas there needs to be no paperwork.
First time I sold it we met in front of a grocery store. Brought the gun out in public, put it on the guy's trunk and counted money.

I used it already. Bought some GoPro batteries with some coins. Less than 30 minutes after I put the order someone orders it, pays it and ships it to me.

Its lost value, you haven't lost money. You still have the same numbers of Bitcoin, they are just worth less. You lose money when you sell those Bitcoins for less than you paid. 
If for some reason there were wallet fees and overtime you lost Bitcoin, then you DID loose money. 
Aren't we treating Bitcoin like money here too?

1. ~~Yes.~~ I meant no, you gotta transfer it via the Send/Request button on the main Coinbase page.
2. Don't buy at once. Buy little by little. Price may drop right after you purchase, but could also go up. Thats up to you.
3. Don't keep it all in one place. Keep it offline for long term. Don't keep staring at the bitcoin charts (you'll go mad) and good luck.

I've noticed many people in your situation posting here. Many of them facing divorce too... interesting.
1. You invested more than you were willing to loose. You were blinded by greed and that never ends well. Accept that.
2. If she's willing to divorce you over money. She never meant what she said at the wedding. In sickness and in health, until death do us part. 
3. You only loose money when you buy high and sell low. If you still haven't sold, you haven't lost money (in a way). Either be patient and wait for the price to go back up in a matter of weeks, months, etc. Or if you really need the money just back out now or wait until the next price bump.

Exactly. You buy it and ship it to an address with a unique number in it. When it gets scanned you get an email and then get quoted to send to you. 
You can also combine a bunch of packages into one box so you pay for one large box instead of a bunch of little ones and have him take the actual product out of the packaging box to make the box smaller in some cases to save more money.
Its pretty neat actually. I do it with some international packages with him to me.

If you're looking into long term investment don't keep it in coinbase. Get a paper wallet and put it in a safe deposit box in your home.

It takes a while. I had to do it about 5 times. Pulled my hair everytime. Specially how I share the same name as my dad, so it only made things more difficult since I had to call him and my mom and have them on the line in case any questions were related to them. And 3/4 of them were.
You'll get it eventually! Hopefully they have a more efficient system in the future. I know they are really busy now, but I wouldn't mind taking a picture of my passport, IDs, SS, face, utility bill, etc and email it to them like bitstamp instead of dealing with those damn questions.

I just send in a wire today via wells fargo. The banker told me they usually recieve the funds within 1-2 days + crediting time.
I've read stories of people saying it shows up next day and, like you said, 3 weeks later. 
Issue with me buying from coinbase is that you can order, say, 5btc right now at $750 (or whatever its at) but it will take 5 days (if you're not verified or already spent all your instant buys for the week). And if the price drops to $300 you're out a lot of money. At least in btc-e you can wait until theres a drop, buy, and then transfer somewhere else. And its cheaper in btc-e too by $50-$100+
So I guess both methods have their ups and downs.

For 13k put it in slowly. Theres a little dip right now so maybe put in 25% at a time. 25% now... wait a bit, if it drops put more in. If it starts going up keep an eye on it.

He won't cash out. He can't. Try it. You've got some of the worlds largest cyber drug lords watching that wallet and some smart people tracking it.[ This guy even followed it through a tumbler.]( 
The second you try to cash out even a tiny percent people will know and they will find out who you cashed it out to which will help them find out who he is. I'm sure sooner or later you'll see a nice big reward for information on his identity. And this guy can't cash out all at once. As a buyer of bitcoin you can either buy some coins from him really cheap or be able to get a HUGE reward if you play dumb and pass the info along and claim that bounty.
Honestly if that was me, the safest thing to do is just return it so you stay anonymous. The second it goes through a merchant he's fucked.
People have been skinned alive and burned alive for MUCH less. 
One does not simply steal money from drug lords. And if you do you should expect to deserve everything that happens to you.

Yeah I sold right before yesterday's drop from 780 on mtgox. Made a nice profit from the original 430 I had, but I needed to use the money. 
I assume when mtgox hits 800 there will be a big sell. Same thing happened when it hit 900. So just wait for that drop to buy and it will go back up!

Your account wont be put on hold if you buy or sell unless you reach your daily limit. And thats still not a "hold" as you'll still be able to send and receive.
However buying takes a while because of the bank transfer times. If you verify your ID, which may take a few tries (it took me about 5 attempts), you'll be able to buy instantly which will immediately give you the coins for the current price and withdrawl the money later from your account. And after 30 days the instant buy will increase.
The credit card is for a back up. So if you instant buy 1btc for $780 but only have 700 in your bank it will take it from the card instead. Since they are giving you the bitcoin first, as I stated above, and withdrawling later. 
The good thing about instantbuy is that you can buy and sell immediately. Unlike normal buying you would buy right now at 780ish and wait a few days and hope the value doesn't drop while they withdrawl the money.
Coinbase has a good reputation and isn't offshore so you should be fine with your information there. 
All this info, and more, is available in their FAQ. Its definitely a good important place to read up on how they work. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:40:14
Make sure you obviously have USD in your account. Click on the BTC/USD button and on the left where it says "Buy BTC" you put in the amount of BTC you want and below you can change how much you want to pay. The price per btc is good in case the price is 815, dropping and you set it at 798 in case it drops that low. Or if the price is 815, rising and you set the sell to 900 to sell right when there is a buy order for $900
Press calculate and then buy btc.
If there are sell orders for your price then you'll buy it immediately.
Go to the top right of the page, click Finances and click on "order:" thing and you'll see your order.
Id show an image of that but I dont have any orders right now :(

I've sold some locally and most people just bring their phone with a wallet and I send it to them there and they hand me the cash.

Not everything on the Silk Road and other marketplaces are illegal. A lot of it is, but not all. Unless a Tor bootable USB, fireworks or counterfeit watch are illegal (which you can get anywhere else with USD as well)
Theres more money in the "good" side of Bitcoin than there is in the bad side.

Im sure it is. I've read almost everywhere with wire transfers that in the end it works out fine and just takes a while.
Still won't be doing transfers to them in the future though. Not worth waiting a month or so. Maybe if they get their act together later on.

The high-risk flagged thing is automatic. Rarely happens but it wasn't done by a human. Coinbase honors their locked-in price so you just need to contact them and they will whitelist you. 
They must be VERY overwhelmed recently with support so be patient. I'm sure there are some support guys there shooting up heroin because they went to take a piss, came back and there are 200 new tickets in 5 minutes.

@_date: 2013-11-30 21:14:51
Have you tried not being a high risk bitcoin terrorist?
In all seriousness, the high risk thing is an automatic system that flags you. They say its not perfect and can send false alarms and its still being worked on. Just send an email to their support and they'll fix it up and maybe whitelist you so you never get the issue again.
They will also honor the original price you bought it at too.

If Bank kicks you out. Just say, "Whatever. I'll go to another bank." Cash out and walk away like a badass from the building. 
I haven't heard of anyone that has gotten into big trouble with their bank. At least you might get a call to make sure you authorized it if it looks fishy. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:07:58
What would I do if I had a million dollar's worth in bitcoin?
I wouldn't cash out all at once. The taxes alone will fuck you over. I'd be smart and hold it. Spend it as needed. If I need some cash I cash out via localbitcoins. If I need to buy something I ask the seller if they are interested in taking bitcoin. Theres no point turning my million dollars worth of btc into a couple hundred thousand by cashing out at once when it can be worth more in the future. 
When theres a big sell it drops $100 at most 150-200 but it quickly recovers.
Supply &amp; demand. Right now there is more demand. And everyday the demand increases.

Bitcoins are like golden potatoes underground. Theres only 21 million golden potatoes and each one needs to be digged up, or "mined", by someone. Unlike Obamamoney (usd) that keeps getting printed and value drops, there can't be more golden potatoes. 
Recently the demand for these golden potatoes has been increasing so the price has been going up. Eventually when the whole world discovers how awesome these golden potatoes are the price will be so high owning one whole potato will be very costly.

Wasn't really meant for a website. It COULD be used if it was slowed down. And like you said that its pretty full blown and I agree.
It was mostly because a friend was toying with the idea of buying a bitcoin atm and if he did he wanted some fancy animations like the newer coke vending machines. So I started messing around with the logo.

Ha! I wish. The thing is since there is a limited amount of Bitcoins (21mil MAX, I'm sure you know this) and theres 7 billion people in the planet. Its impossible for everyone to have one bitcoin.
The more and more its used, accepted and bought/sold worldwide the more and more people will hear about it and a large part of them would want a piece of the Bitcoin cake, but since theres a limited amount of Bitcoin cake the value goes up by demand.
And every day many more businesses begin accepting bitcoin and many more people are buying and using them. 
Will it stabilize? Maybe. Idk. If I knew the future I would be drinking some Margaritas in the bay islands listening to jamaican music looking at my wallet with 5000+ btc and not be on this god-forsaken website that takes up too much of my day ;)
Of course its always a risk. And I'm sure everyone knows that. But I'd rather wake up tomorrow and see half of my money gone than wake up tomorrow and feel terrible watching everyone be part of something huge and wish I would have joined up months ago.

I've sold and bought a lot for years (literally 90% of my purchases are via eBay. Why pay $20 in the store for something I can get for $12.50 online? Unless I need it now, but usually you don't.)
If you just document everything you'll be fine.
Usually when selling cheap things I don't care. I check for flags specially with items over $50 or $100 going to a buyer with low feedback.
Its good to also mention you will only ship to verified addresses and verified paypal accounts. All info you put on the description is assumed to have been read and understood by the buyer after purchase.

Copypasta from before:
Maybe this will help:






Also nothing is stopping you from buying more. Your funds will arrive eventually. Buying them will still take a few days to take the money from your account. So if the price drops a lot or you want it now you could risk it and make a buy order. And I'm sure your money will arrive in your bank before it gets taken out again.

Btc-e has some USD withdrawal options like PayPal but the fees are pretty high. I honestly wouldn't sell on btc-e to withdraw because their prices are much lower. You can milk more out of the Bitcoin titty if you sell it on Coinbase or localbitcoin

Quickly without verification means you'll be paying a premium.
The fasest way is to find someone on localbitcoins or look up locally like on craigslist to see if anyone is selling in your area. For that of course you should meet in a public location like a Starbucks or a bank.
Once you get verified on Coinbase you'll be able to buy instantly up to 10btc/week

I started learning to do it with just a couple hundred dollars. Its risky and fun too in a way. I wouldn't throw thousands in at first or get emotional.

I'm still not confident enough to throw in thousands yet.

Lets not forget how a lot of USD from taxes has been actively used to fund the Syrian Rebels with weapons.

Your logic makes no sense. You could buy it for 40btc claiming it can be worth $100 next weekend but just cash out immediately.
No one will pay 40btc for this. And putting "OBO" in the end is stupid. I'd hate to visit eBay and everything is set to "$500,000 or BestOffer" regardless if its worth $15 
People want to see your asking price not some ridiculous high price. 
You're asking $19,793 - why not put "Or $19,200 in Bitcoins"? Or just say $19,793 in USD or Bitcoins so people can give you what its worth in coins.

A LOT more USD is used for illegal activities compared to Bitcoin.
The USD is also a Federal Reserve note. And the Federal Reserve is pretty much a criminal organization.

Don't cash out from MtGox. It will take weeks or months to get your money. Just send your coins from there to a wallet, coinbase, localbitcoins, etc and sell them there.
5btc right now is still a good amount of dough, so don't fret. They may be worth a lot more in the future too.
And theres no point contacting the FBI. Bitcoins are like cash. If you drop a bag of cash and realize they are missing a year later theres no way to find it unfortunately. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:12:51
Check your wallet on blockchain and see if its been confirmed yet. Sometimes it takes a while. To BTC-e it can take up to 1-2hrs to credit in your account.

I work in video/film as well. I'm not much into the camera department side of it and these rigs I've seen many times. I'm more into the lighting/grip area so I've had to ghetto rig these from grip equipment.
Yours looks pretty solid compared to other ones. Now looking at it from a point of view of a pissed off and tired grip 11hrs into a project getting told to manually clamp shit to some cheapo PVC rig similar to this that the DP bought for $20 I suggest a few things to the design that would make life a lot easier and separate it from your competition:
1. Make the bottom plate a cheese plate. 1/4" and 3/8" holes all ova da place! Easy to mount stuff like that. 
2. A leg to rest the rig on. This could be easily be manually added/rigged but having it is another one of those "little things" that add up. One problem with these rigs is putting it down and not have it fall over. If you make something like a little leg that kicks out, or the ability to add one it would be great!
3. For more elaborate rigs you should add some very solid rail mounting options. Instead of using the quick release piece the rails would be directly connected to the rig. Or at least use a more sturdy quick release option that can be added to a pre-rigged camera on rails. Similar to a Dovetail plate like this: [\[1\]]( [\[2\]]( [\[3\]]( [\[4\]](
Otherwise I gotta say its still A LOT better than other ones.
Also you gotta remember the Bitcoin market is still VERY small, but growing rapidly!
So even if you dont get many sales in Bitcoin don't give up!
Good luck! :)

1) IIRC They base it close to Bitstamp. And I assume it also varies depending on their supply and demand.

Depending where you are you most likely have to physically go to your bank and talk with a banker. Simply tell them you want to send an international wire transfer. It usually takes 15-30min. 
on BTC-e theres a USD deposit via wire option. When that opens you'll see all the information you need. Print it or take a picture of it on your phone before.
Make sure all the information is correct when giving it to the banker and verify it.
The way they know that its going to your account is by a payment detail information you put in. I think its kinda like an account code number thing. So when they receive it they know it goes to this account.
If for some reason its taking longer than normal, maybe some info was put in wrong. Contact them and show them proof you sent a wire. Include info like your name, address, bank name, amount, picture of wire transfer documents, etc. And they can look into it.
Should arrive within a week in average.

China, media, news bringing popularity... Mainly China.
Bitcoin only works if people use it. Thats why things like NMC and LTC are very cheap because not many use it. And when it started getting more popular and accepted world wide, specially in China, the price went up as more bought.
Supply and demand. It could've happened in June and it could've happened next year. It just happened to happen now.

I've sold some on eBay. Never got scammed. However sellers have a lot of strict requirements like verified paypal account and address, instant payments (no using cards via paypal making echecks), show ID in messages, be a paypal and ebay user of over # amount of months or years, have a specific percent of positive feedback, etc.
I've read stories of people mailing receipts or codes and sometimes having paypal actually let the seller win a dispute.
I wouldn't recommend selling any more than like $25 though. Making a fake paypal and ebay account and getting it confirmed with fake info costs a lot more than that. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:29:58

I love this mentality:
**Complain about the system you live in? Well you could be in Africa right now starving!!!** 
Just because you point out the bad things of the system you live in doesn't mean you can just allow it to happen just because there are worst places to live on earth. Its just an excuse to let the government go out of control and not do anything about it because, "Well I could be living in North Korea right now so I'll just bend over and let them fuck me."
This mentality is dangerous and ignorant. The current laws aren't designed to protect you and I, they are designed, written and pushed by corporations and agencies to keep them in power or keep their wallets full regardless if its taking your rights away.
And the large majority of government that enforces them are just doing so because they are getting big campaign donations to do so. Money money money bribery bribery.
America's ~~empire~~ ~~republic~~ democracy isn't perfect, but its the only thing we have now that works best. Why is it so wrong and "unpatriotic and bitchy" to look for better things?
Isn't that what we're doing here with Bitcoin? The USD/other fiat money isn't perfect, its terrible, but its the best thing that works for us right now, but we're pushing Bitcoin which is better.

Looking at their buy price it seems they are doing well. The price went over mtgox too. I assume its because so many people are buying from them that they can just buy back coins for, say, $600 and resell immediately for $625

Between Sep 2011 and Jan 2013 almost no one gave a shit about Bitcoin.
Its simple supply and demand. Theres a limited number of bitcoins that can exist. The more demand the higher the price. Every minute people are willing to pay just a few more dollars for a bitcoin increasing the price slightly. 
And everytime the price goes up it makes the news and more people join the Bitcoin world.

If you're in the US you should set up a coinbase account to buy the coins. With them you have to give your info and link to a bank account to buy and sell. Or localbitcoins.com
With BTC-e you don't really need to verify that much. But putting as much info as you can is good in case you get locked out you can contact support and give them your info.
In mtgox and bitsamp you do have to give them an ID and utility bill. 
You can repay me by using bitcoin and spreading the word. 
^(Then the coins I'm holding will increase ever so slightly in value! Muahahah!)

Nope never been there :S
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:34:35
bitstamp, btc-e and mtgox are more trading exchanges rather than places to buy bitcoin.
If you're looking to just invest and hold then you should use localbitcoins to find some locally and put it in a wallet and return later to avoid having to deal with account verification wait times.

I use btc-e to trade because its not only bitcoin but ltc, nmc and other currencies as well, but when Im happy I send the bitcoin to coinbase and I sell it there for USD. Coinbase recently has been hovering right under mtgox too.
You could play with the arbitrage if you had a lot of money too between them. 
1. Wire transfer 30k to BTC-E
2. 3-7 days later buy 42btc for about $710ea
3. Transfer 42btc from BTC-E to Coinbase.
4. Sell at Coinbase for $840
5. ???
6. Profit (+ $5200)
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:03:54
Different markets. Different prices.
If its easy for you to cash in to btc-e and cash out of MtGox you're lucky because neither are easy to do.

@_date: 2013-11-20 21:09:32
The point is you shouldnt beat yourself up that you bought at 900 and its at 500 now. The point is that if you look ahead you still might make a lot more money regardless.
And of course its a slap to the face to keep an eye on the pricing and not buy when its shooting up crazy like that in the future. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:50:16
I used that too and it worked pretty quickly. Right when the corner boxes came in it registered as well with a few other scanners.
I tried another before to make sure it worked, the QR Android one and it took a while. It also was slow on other default QR codes so its probably a crappy app anyway.

@_date: 2013-12-14 17:22:27
I do mainly use Coinbase, but back then I didn't like waiting for the Coins to arrive and seeing the price change so much. I'd prefer to wire money to exchanges so I can't be panicking watching the price change and not have my coins.
I'm verified now which is cool (I waited too long to do it). I had also sent money to other ones its just that BTC-e ended up being the slowest.
In the end it worked out fine and dandy!
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:48:43
Well yeah bitcoin is becoming popular so its bound to go up. Right now we're all able to take advantage of that before it eventually settles and stabilizes somewhere.

@_date: 2013-11-23 17:45:04
Haven't used mtgox in a long time so it might have changed. I assume theres a withdraw funds area somewhere that you can put in your coinbase wallet address to send them there.

Did they already withdraw the money from your account?
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:24:10
1. Blockchain.info is pretty good, I'm sure there are others. Although for long term stuff take it offline on a paper wallet. And always use 2FA (2 Step Verification- Authy or Google Authenitcator on your iPhone) for everything.
2. Most places, in the US, need you to go to the bank to make a wire transfer. You'll need the recipient's wire information. Varies depending on bank and country. Wires can cost a bit for smaller purchases specially for international ones. I get charged $45 so its only worth it if I sent a couple thousand dollars at once. 
3. If you're in the US use Coinbase.com to sell the coins, you can also buy there too. Their prices are higher so you'll get more cash in return. Or localbitcoins if you want to avoid giving Obama his cut. 
4. App for what? I use android so its hard to answer this, but its good to have price monitors on your phone and a wallet to keep some pocket-coins. 
5. Preev.com is a good calculator. There are more depending on what marketplace you are using. If you use coinbase refer to bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:10:00
You might be saying that 3 years from now! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:05:40
You can! Its called arbitrage. But getting usd into btc-e is kinda a hassle. A wire transfer is the most convenient but can take a week or two at most, but theres a minimum of about $2000
Hopefully eventually they add more efficient methods to deposit usd in the future. 
And mtgox isn't bad to trade. You can withdraw bitcoins easily from there too. I just wouldnt withdraw usd. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:55:56
And then you wish you would have waited another half day and gotten them at 250 instead. You can never know.

@_date: 2013-11-26 18:09:39
I mainly use coinbase to sell. However since its directly connected to the bank buying coins is easy too. And your price-per-btc gets locked when you purchase.
So even if the price right now is about 800 and you buy 5btc. When you get the coins next week you still get 5btc for 800ea even if the price went up to $2500/coin
They also have instant buy which is awesome. You get the coins immediately and they withdrawl the money from your account a few days later, but that takes a while to get set up. 
But coinbase isn't a trading exchange like BTC-e is. Buying &amp; selling in coinbase isn't instant. (Except the instabuy thing, which is still limited to 1btc/10btc a week)
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:44:42
I purchased 2 months from PureVPN at first. Their program is quite fancy compared to manually putting in the info, but I had issues with the connection dropping when on a heavy load like downloading a large file or using VOIP. 
Contacted them about the issue which started 1 day in. They took a few days to respond and I was unable to fix the issue. The same problem happened on another machine so it wasn't on my end.
Couldn't get a refund because it was past 3 days regardless that their service wasn't working properly.
Not a big loss compared to her, but still enough to avoid them.

Thanks, I'll get that.  When I did the wire I completely forgot about the Detail of Payment, but I still put info there.
I already sent them all the information about the wire such as Amount, name, address, bank name, bank address, etc when they asked for it after I had mentioned it originally (they responded the next day) So I understand if it takes a little extra time to hunt it down.

***Should I buy some now?*** - 
***How many should I invest it?*** - What you can afford to lose. Watch the market. Put maybe 25-50% in when the price drops a bit. Keep an eye on it and if it drops a bit more later put more in.  
***What is the best way to store it?*** - Long term: Offline paper wallet. - Short Term: Wallet in computer. Encrypted, backed up, etc. If long term &amp; offline it still wont hurt to keep a bit in a computer wallet. In case theres a huge panic sell you can quickly sell high and buy low again thus giving you even more bitcoins! And you can use those extra btc as pocket-coins to keep the market going. 
Don't keep all your coins in one wallet. Offline or online. Spread them out. 
Good luck. See you at the moon!
