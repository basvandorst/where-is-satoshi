Hate to be a buzzkill, but rather than bothering with assembling a Pi and dealing with all the intracies, get an old Celeron netbook running Windows. Performance is going to be way better and set up is going to be much faster and simpler. Once you account for the price of all the extra goodies for your pi, a netbook is going to be trivially more expensive.

If you want to give a plausible claim here against whom, go ahead.

How can you be literate and have never heard of the Wall Street Journal?

There isn't a good reason to oppose it, but if you've been reading between the lines well enough you'll see why there exists opposition.

Antpool has been mining nearly empty blocks for a good while. With larger or unrestricted blocksize *limits* you're naturally going to see miners decide to restrict the size of their blocks to less than the maximum. If the network requires every miner to be constantly pushing every block to the limit in order to process transactions something is seriously wrong.

This is an argument that doesn't support the conclusion. None of the proposed block size increases pose any meaningful increase in the cost to run a node or a meaningful reduction in nodes. I run a node on a Kmart netbook I bought 5 years ago for $200. You could increase the blocksize to 8MB, 16MB and aside from needing a hard drive upgrade eventually, it'd be fine for years.
Meanwhile, whatever minimal cost increases are there are to *run* a node, there are substantial savings for anyone on the network in the form of reduced fees. The savings a frequent bitcoin user could experience with larger blocksizes and lower blocksizes would easily outweigh whatever minimal added costs there are to run a node- after all, the ones making frequent transactions are the ones most likely to need to want to run a node in the first place.

Sounds like a really piss-poor tort claim. Won't hold up. Good luck trying to claim people voluntarily participating in an open-source project have any duty to use any particular version of the code.

Except no one has any obligation to mine at the block size limit. That's just a limit. If the block size limit goes to 2 MB or 8 MB or 32MB, a lot of miners may still decide to restrict the size of their own blocks to less than that for whatever reason, whether it's a belief they'll be faster to propogate and more likely to win the reward despite giving up transaction fees or a desire to keep the load on nodes low.
As has suggested, smaller blocks may be better for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is all about the voluntary choice and freedom of participants to react however they like to particular economic incentives. Rationally, if antpool is behaving irrationally, the next miner would pump out a big block and sweep all those transaction fees with it. It's only a problem now because we've restricted the block size so much now that nearly every block is full- this prevents the free market from correctly assessing the risk of making a larger block to the increased fee rewards and making a decision to produce a larger block.

Yeah, but I could venmo/paypal someone $100 for free instantly. Or write a check and do a mobile deposit and have the transaction post immediately. Or use a number of bank payment services that don't charge a fee. Or give the person a $100 bill.
"Well at least one way of sending $100 that basically no one would use to send $100 is obviously more expensive and inconvenient" is not a great argument.

If people buy bitcoin on Bitfinex to withdraw, they would then sell their coins elsewhere, driving the price *further* down on those other exchanges. We haven't seen that.

I can run a 2 MB block or 8 MB block or a 16 MB on a Kmart netbook I purchased 4 years ago. Aside from a $50 hard drive every 3-5 years, there's not much else I need under any of these blocksizes. The trivial increase is going to be more than made up for in savings from just a few transactions a month.
What hardware is going to be so expensive under these conditions?
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:19:37


The price will naturally stabilize when Bitcoin is about as big as it's going to be. And we're many, many times away from that. I wouldn't put $500,000 out of question for a stabilized price.

I could find *you* and beat you with a wrench until you give me your coins.
