Well damn... This story has made me re-evaluate some things... I should start doing some positive things some of the ridiculous profits I’ve made for those in need. 1k to me is nothing significant, to another it can literally change their life.
Oh, and fuck bully’s... been there too brah

I’ve lived a great life so far, majority of these kids will not nor will they live long enough to see crypto become mainstream. I think it would be amazing if a few kids’ dreams were realized thanks to a bitcoin donation.

There is almost zero any need unless they have their own dedicated markets like usdt for trading against other coins.

Does it work with a ledger nano for a tx to an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:23:51
If you don’t want to wait, pushtx.btc.com
It actually works, though the fee they charged me was astronomical. Took about 3 hours and my tx confirmed.

Yes, they facilitate trading currencies and that's it. You'll still need a fiat exchange or localbitcoins to cash out from what I understand.

Yep, buddy in Chicago told me earlier tonight he bought a pizza recently with bitcoin.

More and more new money is coming in, so many many new buyers. Daytraders are always buying /selling so there will always be coins for sale at any price...

If you want to try and hide your money by all means go ahead. You may get away with it for years, then one day your tax authority thinks your lifestyle doesn't match your reported income and rips your life apart. Is it really worth it? No. Pay your taxes...

Fees will be up to 10%, highly recommend doing a tiny transaction first. I can pretty much guarantee coinbase is way cheaper. Another person on Reddit recently bought $100 via ant ATM and only got $90, that's insanity (yeah I get it, atms have overhead etc, but 10%!?!?!)
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:19:09
Not unless fees are small. 10%? Give me a break...
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:24:52
Actually, depending on bank, it takes a day or two to post you your online bank account. At least here in Canada it does
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:30:39
99% coming from Korean exchanges only, so that doesn't really say much...
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:43:31
How do you explain the jump from $2800 to $4300? The fees were bad at $2800 too you know... Fees do not seem to impact btc at all, bch "solved" that and it had negligible impact, users do not care at this point as it'll be solved relatively soon.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:13:47
If you are buying something for a dollar, don't use btc! Use ltc or something else instead. No confirmations by passing a low fee should not be a surprise...
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:30:13
None, because I'm all in chaincoin!!!
If they are up to date on crypto they will know you mean to piss off. If they are clueless they'll buy into that coin and loose it all, then they'll never bug you again.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:49:26
Near everyone is looking at crypto right now as investments, no one is looking to buy a coffee with it. We all want to be rich, because it will make us happy :x
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:13:04
My bad, it's 59% coming from 3 Korean exchanges, majority of that coming from one of those. It's pretty clear someone or some group is pumping this coin like no tomorrow. If volume was spread out a bit more your original statement would be more impactful.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:09:13
Same... life has been so much better since I unsubbed, 95% of those posts are so damn negative...

@_date: 2017-08-08 23:06:19
This happens on every exchange, I've seen it on bittrex and quadrigacx. Tiny buy orders that constantly appear then disappear, then reappear at a slightly different price to solely influence the human buyers/sellers.

I am, for $20 a month we get a ton of content commercial free as well as 2 on demand channels for all hbo shows and hundreds of movies. It is by far a better purchase than Netflix for us, much better value. But that's just us...

Btc needs to stabilize, so many of us currently regard btc as an investment right now as it's volatile, could jump or drop 1k any second. If btc had the stability of usd for example, adoption would skyrocket.

I'm most curious to know what the ATM transaction volume is. At 10% fees, who uses these unless they are targeting new comers who know nothing about them.

Yep, had same thing happen to my car back in college. I parked same spot on the road everyday, neighbors friend backed straight into my driver door while backing out, poor girl in tears. My door still opened/closed with a giant dent, car was POS Pontiac, so told her to be more alert and go on her way. I'm way too nice sometimes.
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:45:40
Come on dude, you aren't fooling anyone... 
Share the source code of your "bot" if it's legit. Oh you don't want to do that? 
1. Your full of shit and previous commenter is 100%. Correct.
2. Your bot auto buys just prior to posting on your telegram.
Either way, you are scamming others. No one does something like this unless they want to profit off of others...

6.75% is a joke!! Not even close to the best deal... coinsquare and quadriga have interac online @ 1.5%. Coinsquare btc price is much better than quads so it's about the best deal apart from wiring.

@_date: 2017-09-16 13:36:41
Huobi and okcoin are not "shutting down"... they are ceasing cny trading. That's all! All other trading will resume. The second they are licensed whenever that happens it'll be back like a vengeance...
There are 3 scenarios that will happen:
1. Chinese traders liquidate all their btc.
2. They sell ~half btc.
3. Most don't sell any btc.
I personally think it's  They'll cash out some profits but keep a good chunk in so they won't miss out on any new coins / deals during the shutdowns. Also it's pretty much guaranteed once exchanges enable cny trading again, price skyrocket. Great time to sell at that point.

Have an updoot for the chuckle sir.

Quadriga or coinsquare. I've been experimenting with Gemini as well, though it's USD instead of CAD.
My opinion, biggest movement will happen mid-end October, not this month.

This. Coinbase is great for quick instant buys on the go with credit card via the iPhone app, but really quadriga is the best with interac online. Coinsquare another option.

Tried it, unfortunately it was just not satisfying enough for me. Will try again tho, cause fuck smoking...

Japan's trading increased same time China's decreased. Coincidence? Nope.
All they gotta do is ban foreign trading and voila, crash.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:02:31
As mentioned above, quadrigacx. Coinsquare is another Canadian exchange, terrible interface tho.

Or he hits me, no insurance, I spend weeks in hospital, body messed up for life, my insurance doesn’t cover it because the other driver has none, I sue him, garnish his wages for life, get maybe 50-100k over 20 years if he has a decent job...
No insurance is the absolute dumbest idea on the planet. I’d rather pay a higher premium each month knowing that the other drivers are covered.

Bingo, find a small local credit union and you are golden. I don’t dare use my big 3 banks for crypto due to mortgage bills etc, but my credit union is strictly for crypto. Account manager knew nothing about bitcoin, very old school. Heck mine just started supporting interac etransfers.
I don’t think op is being completely transparent though. If he is constantly shifting large sums of money around, depositing / withdrawing significant sums of cash, those are red flags. Since there is no easy aml standard yet to trace tx (come on AMLT, waiting...) for crypto this would be flagged as high risk behavior. Not implying op is doing anything shady though, just how it looks.
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:27:10
There was no dip last weekend... it happened two weeks in a row, that's not a "trend". Crypto can't be predicted.
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:17:50
Uhm yes it will. Bitcoin is splitting, value splits with it... immediately after split price will fluctuate fast on both coins.

Get a usd bank account, keep your money in there or buy xbt through that. Separate USD banks are what we cross border workers use. Your employer will never pay in XBT, as your wage can't be easily traced if he gets audited. Payroll auditing is common. I wouldn't even bother asking.

Ya screwed something up, lost internet access or something during the transaction. Interac online is solid, it's the only way I fund my account, never one issue.
Give them time, like all exchanges, they prob have a massive support queue.
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:02:58
99% of users will screw this up and result in so many additional support tickets, so not very practical.

$5 for $200 via interac, max you can do until you do a full verification per day. Then it's 1.5% and max $2000 per day. They verified my biz account in around 3 days.

Simple, exchanges want you to stay on their exchange. They aren't gaining anything by making it easier to transfer between exchanges.
