This is a way to create a small passive income by mining some cheap coins such as Bytecoins on your pc then exchanging them for cloud mining contracts on Eobot, which has been around since 2013.Not a get rich quick this is a slow way to gradually earn some coins.

Have you heard about bitcoin and the money revolution, but wondered what it is, and why things are changing so fast? Are you caught in the grip of poverty or debt, and wish there was a way out? Do you think the world is stuck in a rut of slavery, and don’t see a clear path to freedom? In this article I will address these questions and show you why the world is in its current dilemma, and what the bitcoin revolution is doing to change everything.

Nope, it was a fun build and I learned a lot about solar power and setting up a rasbperrby pi to run asics but there is no money to be made using this method until bitcoin hits about $30M... But dayum it has been fun lol :P

I don't want you to buy Bitcoin at all. I want the price to stay as low as possible, for as long as possible. The long term value of Bitcoin is not how many USD you can trade it for. Can you see where Q.E and the global currency war are taking the USD? If Bitcoin is to be the currency of the New World Order, which I hope it is not, because I hate that shit, then I think it would be wiser to hold some than not. I'm stacking a few BTC alongside silver, food, water, solar panels etc. Fuck the get rich quickers.
