Are you in the US? If no, there are better options than coinbase. If yes, there are still better options rather than coinbase.
Coinbase is an xchange. They also provide u with a wallet. Sometimes while they are providig service, the wallets dont work or disappear or glitch which makes it bad for the holder if they need to buy or sell.
Putting it on a hardware will give ubaccess whenever u need it + more security.
Plus, ledger have suggestions for exchanges rather than coinbase.. im about to explore the options..
Another reason someone would buy a hardware wallet would be: looking at bitcoin as a longterm investment, rather than short term trading...even tho short term trading would also be safer on a hardware wallet

To me libra is like Dollars... the digital version. Less cost for the government (printing) and they can remove or add the amount they want to the system to regulate... so much bullshit in Libra

Any suggestions for us new comers?
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:44:40
How would that even be possible? Bitcoins are limited. Teslas can always be manufactured
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:56:55
I get it, it happens...
But whats a good solution to this problem?
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:44:44
Because S does everyhing i need. X is for people who have a lot of coins and spend it on their coffee on the daily
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:36:38
Thanks. Thats a very good idea actually.
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:25:20

I can use ledger live with nano s
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:08:34
Interesting..... youbwould think the ledger hardware would work best with the ledger software designed specifically for it
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:45:21
Im Mr. Mee6. Look at me

@_date: 2019-06-27 16:18:33
Why would you need two? Sorry if its a dumb question.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:11:06
You sauly that, but coinbase went down 4 hours ago and while they were down, bitcoin went down....a lot of people lost money. And im pretty sure Coinbase isnt a shitty xchange. Unless im wrong...
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:36:50
Ledger provodes you with an exchange that uses your wallet directly. Maybe thats a better option? But just so u know, coinbase takes a fee for transfering coins in amd out of your wallet and for conversion... coinbase sux
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:40:16
Not sure what your problem is lol.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:11:34
Neither... hardware wallets..
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:48:42
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:41:06
Thats actually one of the reasons I didnt want bluetooth on my device.
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:27:51
