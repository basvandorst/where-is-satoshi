The epitome of Xrp brainlets: they would rather have value derived from “nothing”. Might as well call it fiat then.

Are you just a hater or something?
Your arugment makes so much sense, I guess early investors in Microsoft stock were hated so the government created its own brand. I guess Apple early investors were hated so the government created their own brand. I guess the first guy to ever use gold as a bartering item was hared so much we used some other metal.
None of that happened, you can still get some bitcoin and hold its not too late no need to spew retarded baseless arguments here.
The investors are the people using and developping said technology and technological advancement does not care about what the public thinks. You sound like some anti vaxxer

Did you just say some people dont want to invest in something because they dont want to enrich others, and more importantly the pioneers of what they are investing in?
What the hell are you smoking.
Literally investing in something means putting incentive on the line for the people currently in the said company/project/crypto. 
You basically just proved that you have no idea what the term “investing” even means.
If they dont want to invest in crypto then yeah sure whatever floats their boat man, but to “not enrich others” literally means not investing.

He sells gold and accepts bitcoin.
He does not give bitcoin to buy gold.
Sorry to break it to you, but Peter is no dumbass, he just cannot possibly tell everyone hiw much Bitcoin is better, especially when he’s been telling everyone for years about how great Gold is and how there is nothing better. For public appearances he simply cannot admit that he’s been stocking up on bitcoin.
The persona he puts on his blogs and TV and youtube is part of his play and theatre.

Well if you had to make a post about losing 3 cents, I honestly dont think you should be investing in anything, because you might need the money in the near future...

Looks like you are comparing data from stocks under 100 million.
Bitcoin has a marketcap of 200 billion or so. So the stocks who are around that size in marketcap can be like Home Depot, Pfizer, Taiwan Semiconductor, Mastercard, Toyota etc. If any of those move more than 5% in a single day it is very very noticeable and highly unusual to say the least.
Here are a few altcoins in the 20-50 million marketcap range though if you really wanted to show relevant data in your analogy:
- NIX (+65% last 24h)
- MTC (+58% today)
- XMX (+921% this week)
- BOX (+263% this week)
- RET (+459% this week)
Note: i own none of these coins and I dont even know what the hell they are, I just pulled the data.
Also, comparing something like Bitcoin to stock is, in my opinion not such a relevant topic because these simply do not operate the same way at all and are not bound to the same investors, institutions and regulations (for now).
To respond to you quite frankly, I have not seen any stock that has a similar marketcap to bitcoin with nearly as much consistent volatility as bitcoin.
I do not hold any opinions on whether volatility is good or bad but I just thought that you used incorrect sets of data to point something out that does not relate.
Sorry if this sounds harsh, maybe theres something im not seeing?

My rebuttal was to your use of the small marketcap stocks comparing it to bitcoin. 20% gains/losses easily happens with any lower cap and less liquid financial instrument/asset. Literally watches can have more % gains/losses in a day too.
The volume of bitcoin in usd the past 24 hours is around 43 billion.
@_date: 2019-08-01 06:15:40
Quite literally tl/dr
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:08:29
Lol you’re right in a way ill give you that one.
And no i only bought btc at 20k, im waiting for the next peak to buy high and sell low again.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:19:42
Less than 25% of its full cap? Everything you listed yourself in your screenshots average 3% of their full cap in volume so nevermind 25%
Pfizer mcap is 241 billion and their average volume is less than 2 billion (so around 1%)
Home Depot mcap of 228 billion and average volume is around 1 billion (0.5% around)
All the other caps similar to bitcoin are trading at much lower volume.
From the exact same stocks you have listed in your screenshots posted before:
MARA - marketcap of 22m, average volume last 10 days is 1.4m (so around 6%)
SING - marketcap 29M, average volume last 10 days is 96,000$ (so around 0.3%)
MGTI - marketcap 15.9M, average volume last 10 days 459,000$ (around 2%)
So what are you talking about with a figure of 25%? Nowhere from your own examples do any of those stocks even come close to 10% of marketcap and you’re using 25%.
Bitcoin has 5-20 times the volume of any stock including large and small caps.

You’re delusional. You literally made an argument saying stocks move like this and that it is not impressive.
We have said that yes, due to Bitcoin’s size it should be impressive.

Basically you just said that he believes in bitcoin more than you do.
Wanna know what I think? i think you literally have nothing to do except screencap some twitter post that you dislike.
If I learned anything from this thread it’s that you hurt bitcoin more than Mcafee does, saying he has “moon fever” as if it’s a direct insult to your mother’s grave.
You do not see reality, because in reality Mcafee has done more for crypto than you will ever do.
Get rekt.
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:22:44
Complete delusions. Everything is manipulated, the sooner you understand that the sooner you will be back to reality
You literally just changed your stance from “hurr mcafee hurting my buttcoins” to “bitcoin is just a way to make more fiat”
Looks like you’re one hell of an emotional rollercoaster.
I was going to add “get rekt” but you seem to be on point for that one already.

Interac transfers are not free with tangerine. Tangerine Email Transfers to OTHER TANGERINE CUSTOMERS are free. The e-transfer is 1.00$ for each.
Also, for corporate RBC accounts your e-transfers arent free either. Source: I have a corporate RBC account and they cost me 1.50$ each. I dont know what kind of special account you have there.
On the link you just posted literally there is a footnote attached to where it says its free and the footnote reads that a 1.00$ personal e-transfer fee or a 1.50$ RBC Business customer fee for e-transfers “may” be applied. To be honest I’ve never gotten a free e-transfer.
Another reason why RBC is garbage: misleading advertisements.
