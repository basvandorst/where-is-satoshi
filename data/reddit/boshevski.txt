There is beta testing active for the web application [Metadisk]( which is the web-node for Storj.
The desktop application DriveMiner which is in development (check the preview [here](  will let you sell your disk space on Storj and earn money.
You can come to the [Storjtalk]( forum to discuss Storj and it's web applications with the community, get access to beta testing, and earn 1SJ0 per post.
Also stay up to date with news on [or on the [blog](

50 live beta testers from 22 countries for [DriveShare]( at the moment, it's very wrong to say that [Storj]( is a vaporware.
