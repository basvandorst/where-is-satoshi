The bigger question is how can we ever hope crypto will survive if we don´t have exchanges that are hackable. Sorry immutability means nothing if no one feels their crypto is safe. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:08:07
and you some how believe that BTC isn't dead if there is no way to securely acquire and liquidate BTC. Without secure exchanges you will never see serious money in BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:30:43
Great strategy for holders, but if crypto currency is going to ever have any function over holding it, we need to have secure on and off ramps, as well as the ability to feel secure in our ability to carry out day to day functions.

I think the scariest part of learning about crypto and more importantly how our current monetary system works,  is how little those in charge of it actually know.
@_date: 2015-06-14 11:04:48
Not necessarily. There are solutions such as the Lightening network which could still process more transactions without increasing the blocksize. Increasing the blocksize is only a short term fix and has a finite limit. We need to explore other means for achieving scalability and micropayemnts if we ever want Bitcoin to be a mainstream financial tool.
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:45:08
You example doesn't hold. Your factors aren't consistent with the Silk Road market (risking $200k to get $5M). The amount of bitcoins in their position at any given time represents about a weeks worth of transactions. You aren't going to scam a weeks worth of transactions and destroy a revenue stream that pales in comparison. This is why Silkroad replaced the funds and made people whole and would do it again.
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:14:51
I don't see why you don't let the market decide it. Intermediaries are going to continue to evolve ontop of the Blockchain. I could see a future where we have places where we can store our bitcoins that are FDIC insured. These depositories would be regulated just like banks are regulated. If that is important to you ( I assume this is for a lot of people)  then you could store your bitcoins there. If not and privacy and anonymity were more important you could put your Bitcoin elsewhere. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:03:34
What mechanism ties the price to gold between a store of value and as a use of Jewelery. The value of the Blockchain can be calculated by looking at what the market currently values what a trusted transaction is worth. For CC processing it is about 2-3% of a transaction.

Wouldn't make a lot of sense to announce arrests if you had a workable honey pot. The number one rule of spying/cryptology is if you are able to crack the code, you need to do everything possible to ensure that the other party can't use statistics (normal distribution) to detect that you have. You milk it for as long as you can manipulating  the amplitude of the standard deviation, while keeping it normal.

So you believe that Amazon wouldn't like to have a piece of the $500 Billion in fees for credit card, bank fees, and remittance market? Amazon is already working on a e-currency/payment solution so it really isn't debatable. But it is laughable that anyone would think that they will allow an open source platform to erode "perceived" profits without a fight. Not saying they will be successful but they definitely have a shot.

It is no more a threat than Visa is to Paypal. All things equal Paypal would rather have a customer pay with Bitcoin then with Visa. There costs go from 1.8% to 0% on transactions, where they can then charge a merchant 4%.

Well I would break consumers down into several different groups. Yes for those that have credit cards and pay off their balances then Bitcoin is going to be a hard sale, unless vendors start offering rebates better then the CC. And for this they have strong reasons do do so. A killer app could automatically incorporate these features. I am an online vendor and I would love nothing more then to cut all ties with CC companies if I could.  
But let's not forget that there are many consumers in the US (the majority) that don't have access to credit cards and their only option is very expensive gift cards to shop online. 
I don't really think that the majority of consumers in the US care about privacy and truth be told unless you are very careful Bitcoin isn't very private. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:57:03
You are making an assumptions here that I don't agree with. That Bitcoin would be the only way to transact and that no new currencies could prevail. You are also assuming that the return on investment by holding BTC is the best risk/reward investment of ones wealth.
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:57:23
I suppose that in addition to the CC advantage you also have an arbitrate play here as well. If the price of BTC increases by more than the discount the customer is requesting in the time since they ordered.
Which begs the question what exchange sets the rate, and how often is it updated?

Why would the average Joe choose TCP/IP over OSL? Well he didn't. Others chose it because it allowed them to develop a protocol that was faster cheaper and better. Why does the average Joe choose Fractional Reserve Banking to the Gold standard. Again he doesn't. He chooses offering that arise from Fractual reserve banking. Bitcoin will be the same. It is a platform that allows us to move money, faster, cheaper, and better for the modern era. Products will bloom that consumers will desire. Bitcoin will never be the end product for the average Joe, but be sure he will use it in his daily life.

One thing to keep in mind is that transferring money from your bank account is more than 40EUR. The main fee you will pay will be the difference between the bank exchange rate and the real exchange rate, i.e Bank of America transfers at 1.44 when the real rate is 1.37 (this is USD to EUR).  
Note my experience is in the opposite direction to yours as I transfer money from the US to Portugal. What I do is buy my coins through one of the many exchanges that use USD. I usually pay a nominal fee .15%. Then I transfer the Bitcoin to my Kraken account and then sell the Bitcoin in EUR (.15%). I then transfer the money by SEPA from Kraken to my Portugal Bank account. 
As the other poster said I usually end up making a profit on the transactions, as I will usually set a limit order to buy at the intraday low and then set a sale at the intraday high.
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:39:53
Yeah, it could be a small risk if the card is stolen. But I can tell you as an internet vendor, who has dealt with several fraudulent chargebacks, good luck getting anyone to investigate and prosecute this. The Credit Card companies could care less they loose nothing. Amazon isn't going to care because they will pull the funds from the vendor.  
@_date: 2014-05-21 10:26:42
Even if you could devise such a system, you still couldn't stop someone from exchanging the currency for something that both currencies accept and then convert from that.

Completely agree. Why would anyone want to have multiple software wallets when you could have one, that allows you to pay the way you want to, be it with Credit Card, BTC, or your Bank Account. Apple will be forced to eventually include virtual currencies, just to stay competitive with other wallets. The real loser in this equation is the credit card companies. It opens up a terminal now that can be agnostic to payment type. If you are Apple or other wallet provider, why process Visa and MC payments where you will be paying 80% of your margins to them, when you may be able to keep 100% if someone pays with BTC.  This really is the needed step for disruption.
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:39:22
Amazon isn't going to implement Bitcoin for the same reason Apple and Facebook won't be implementing it. They are all racing to built their own e-currency. Vendors are hungry for alternatives to credit card companies for sure but the million dollar question is would a vendor specific currency be adopted faster then Bitcoin or another open source e-currency. One thing is for sure, these companies aren't going to hand over the massive profits from a potential offering without a fight.

There really is no advantage at the moment. But I would expect that you are going to see services and companies that come along that will add strong value props to attack this market. Keep in mind that the infrastructure needed to run a credit card network is significantly more then the Bitcoin network. Therefore companies that process payments on the Bitcoin protocol will be able to offer more advantages to the consumer in the long run at a lower cost. Additionally because there is far less regulations, I would expect that we will see much faster innovation in payment protocols then what we have seen from credit card companies, which really haven't added anything new accept cvv codes in 50 years.
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:23:49
I guess that really depends on your situation. I don't believe many of the people that had BTC with MTgox was looking at a profit and would most likely want to take advantage of a capital loss to minimize their tax burden. 
Second if you were utilizing your bank account then it won't be very hard for the IRS to calculate your gains. They are going to want to know where the money that is coming in came from an why you didn't report it as income.

The IRS is not going to need to see the BTC. Where did the cash come from to buy the Bitcoin? If there is any paper trail then the IRS will want to know why you didn't declare that income. If there was no audit trail then you holding it in cash or in BTC makes no difference.
@_date: 2014-10-30 23:28:15
I think this will be an important app for driving bitcoin consumers. Think of someone who makes $400USD a week, is unbanked and is spending 10-15% on cash checking and prepaid visa cards to pay bills. Assume they are living paycheck to paycheck and can't risk any downside volatility.  They are not interested in speculating in BTC, they just want an easier and cheaper way to distribute their money. If we are ever to have mass adoption beyond investors and speculators, you need a service like this.

I also believe that most police officers while they might not condemn this publicly, are secretly disgusted by such actions.

I think ultimately banks will embrace Bitcoin, as a way to move money. The systems they currently use are antiquated and in desperate need of upgrading. A big issue for financial systems is security. This is why most of the financial systems run on servers and networks from the 70's. Banks have been very wary to introduce systems that are yet to be proven. Bitcoin allows them to use a proven technology at a very low cost to perform transactions that have very little value but a high cost to perform in the current systems.
@_date: 2014-10-01 09:09:19

I think the bigger fear here is that someone might know your Bitcoin holdings. Not an issue if you are holding 1 or 2, but what if someone knows that you have 10,000 BTC?

The inherent value of Bitcoin is the blockchain. To say that a system of networked computers that can process transactions in a trust less environment has no value is absurd.    I would argue that the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is much higher then any other commodity including gold. In the end it really is a moot point for me because I believe that intrinsic vale is overated when it comes to currency and assets.  Perception and market demand is what matters in the end. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:17:13

What Ran Paul and others miss when they say that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value is the blockchain. There is intrinsic value in a network of computers that are able to allow users to perform transaction with trust when none exist between the participants. Given that we have many intermediaries that perform this function, that value shouldn't be hard to calculate and in my opinion is more valuable then the "intrinsic value" of gold (estimated to be 5% of golds value to account for electronics and jewelery).   
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:55:35
Ok. 
1) I will carry one debit card behind my iPhone and its case.
2) I will frequent merchants who use NSF technology, just as I know use merchants who take credit cards and avoid ones that don't.
3) Pretty sure you will be able to specify a default payment, so there will be no need to choose a type of payment.
4) To believe that credit cards aren't going to evolve and stay the same, seems a bit short sighted. Combining them into a mobile device makes sense. Pay Pal, Google, and a whole host of companies seem to agree.

I think at this point in time there is no advantage to users of credit cards to switch over to Bitcoin. But keep in mind that Bitcoin can still flourish while we wait for the "killer app" to come along and compete with credit card type transactions. Think of all the people in the world that don't have a bank account much less a credit card. Also look at the prepaid market in the US and the fees associated with those accounts, that Bitcoin could displace. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 07:12:42
I guess when you really think about this shouldn't really surprise us. Most investors in Bitcoin are speculators at the moment, they are not using it as a store of value. Bitcoin just doesn't have the flight to safety reputation yet and how could it with such swings. Not to say that it won't get there, but those that tend to be conservative looking for safety in metals, are only starting to warm up to Bitcoin and that reception is very tepid. Actually if you listen to many gold proponents, there number one gripe with Bitcoin, is no one knows how it holds up in a down market.

Really, really, really like the idea. Obviously as a intermediary there is a trust issue here but the concept has a lot of potential.  This could be a perfect business model for a DAC. If you take this further and make a more simplified interface you could be looking at the killer app Bitcoin has been looking for. It gives shoppers (which is what bitcoin needs) a strong motive to use such an app and more importantly to use bitcoin. As long as you had enough buyers or could find other value props for them I could see something like this being very successful and helping to evangelize BTC.

Reditt isn't going to build upon the Bitcoin protocol. First of all the CEO Yishan has been very critical of the Bitcoin community and very pro alt coin. Everything he has publically stated was laying the groundwork for his own currency. Second Reditt is a company like any other, that is looking for additional revenue streams and their discussions will be driven by such - not what is best for the community or cyptocurrency. They are not giving away 10% ownership to benefit the community. I see this as one of the many companies that will try to start their own cryptocurrency, in it for a quick buck but will ultimately fail due to the network effect needed to truly have a successful cryptocurrency. This battle is no different then the early days of the Internet where companies tried to build proprietary products to compete with openness of the Internet and ultimately failed.
I expect that Overstock and Bryne will come out with a more thought out plan, that is trying to advance cryptocurrencies and the concept of autonmous exchanges. Reditt just seems to be playing on the hype rather than working with the community to do something revolutionary.

Look their biggest fear of Bitcoin at the moment is that they are afraid that it is going to pull demand away from gold, which they are heavily vested. To assume that Gold will always be a scarce commodity is just plain foolish. The universe as well as our own oceans are full of it. It takes only one meteor to be mined and we could introduce a hundred times the Gold that is in existence. In addition what the h*ll are they talking about capital gains on Bitcoin but somehow implying that Gold doesn't have any.  In the UK this is the case but as they are both US citizens and they are speaking specifically about the IRS, this seems to be a red herring.

Actually my understanding is it is the Banks that are giving Apple a .15% cut and not Visa and MC. The Merchants are still paying their agreed upon rate. At some point the majority of those fees about 2.75% are going to MC and Visa.

Let's also not forget that the banks don't want to give up any float (interest) they receive why the money is being held by them while the transfer is being carried out.

The problem is when you go to convert to fiat you are then going through a intermediary which needs to report your transactions to the IRS. As the person said above what you are describing is what lots of people that are paid under the table do, and that is under report or don't report their income. But the IRS has ways to catch you, by tracking your purchases and matching that to your tax return.  As long as you aren't living large buying boats, cars, houses, then it isn't a problem. But even with an anonymous solution you are still going to need to register the title of any significant purchase and that is what leaves you vulnerable.

I see a future where trusted parties like an Apple or Paypal are the software interface for multiple payment options. Seems rather ridiculous to have 5 different apps each for a different payment methods. In this scenario the losers become the credit card companies as alternative payment channels like Bitcoin will be cheaper to process giving Apple or Paypal larger profits on Bitcoin transactions as opposed to say Visa or MC.

I don't see that happening. I think Amazon will fight Bitcoin until it is completely obvious that they can't build their own e-currency platform. Plus I still think we are missing the "killer app" for the consumer that makes them want to put down the CC and use bitcoin instead. It will come, but until then I think companies like Amazon, Apple, and Facebook won't be helping to promote Bitcoin, as they seek out how to monetize their own e-currency.

You are assuming every investor is long, that isn't how investing works.  Also since no investment vehicle only goes up, it is unreasonable to believe that consumers want "risk" when making purchases. Actually entire businesses are built around locking in today's prices in the Future market. I stand by my assertion, if you don't allow people or businesses a way to lock in prices, you are going to find it hard to get them to implement.

This really isn't a either or answer. It is like saying why should I use credit cards instead of cash. Well the answer to that depends on many factors, like your financial clout, whether you can get a credit card or not, the likelihood of fraud in a transaction, and the trust amongst the parties. The decision to use BTC or not will most likely follow a similar decision process. I also think that the way you ask the question assumes that their is only the extremes, to use Bitcoin (with no 3rd party middlemen) and using banks. I envision a world where we will have many more options. Ones in which hybrid models will arise where consumers will be able to pick and choose services that are important to them (utilizing 3rd parties or Decentralized autonomous companies). Where these companies utilize the low cost benefits of a distributed ledger, but offer many services that banks and credit cards offer (i.e guarantee of principal, mileage points, ease of use etc.) plus new services we haven't even thought of yet. One great thing about competition is it sprouts innovation. 
In the end the Blockchain allows companies and individuals to move money, faster, cheaper and better then existing systems. History has shown us when you have these 3 ingredients, you will have a no shortage of adoption. I can easily see a day when SWIFT is replaced with applications built upon the Blockchain. Thereby reducing large expenses (Servers, IT security, software development, Compliance support, etc. ). In this scenairo you would be using Bitcoin and not even know it. Which is what I believe will eventually be the case for the vast majority of people using services built upon the Blockchain.

While this has been discussed before, I believe that the theory just doesn't have as big of an impact as people think. This theory makes certain assumptions.

3) That new buyers of bitcoin are not entering the market, to take advantage of discounts or hype.

Well first you should examine what you mean by a fraudulent signature. If someone that was authorized to sign for the check did so and stole the money I am certain that the bank isn't liable. So if you have only one signature for a check then you have a single point of failure. Not sure why you need the wallet to determine if it is a known payee. I am assuming that this isn't automated at the moment, and needs a human to manually review the check. Seems to me by adding multisig you are already more secure then a system that allows for a single signature. It seems like you haven't given us all the controls you currently have.

In order for Bitcoin to achieve mass adoption there is going to need to be two different strategies for bitcoin in my opinion - one as an asset and one as a currency. I just don't see how the goals of both could be met with just owning the underlying BTC. Consumers want stability and investors want volatility. 
Glad to here that Circle was alluding to dollar-denominated bitcoins. I really do think that is the killer app for consumer adoption, which is critical if BTC is going to succeed.  I think if they can offer a service where consumers who want to use Bitcoin as a currency pegged to the USD (or other currency), i.e they want to buy $100 USD of Bitcoin and regardless what the price of BTC does they can buy $100 of goods, then Bitcoin becomes pallatable to a much larger audience.
For those that prefer to handle Bitcoin as an asset there will be owning the underlying asset as well as having access to the derivatives that allow for a pegged currency. If they can pull off a market like that, then I am very excited about Circle.

We had a issue similar, but in addition to my wife's ID they wanted my ID plus proof of address as well (because I had originally tried using my credit card, but because it was US it was denied). So we set my wife up with an account and used her foreign credit card. At that point like you the account was suspended and the endless process of requesting more and more information started. Finally they wanted When they started  asking for my information because my card had been declined earlier,  it just seemed they were overstepping. When we finally objected that we felt we were exposing ourselves to risk by basically providing them or any body that hacked their system with the keys to our finances.  We finally asked them to stop the process and just refund our account. They told us that they couldn't do that (at least they gave you the 180 day option). I finally told them that I was going to call my bank and start a charge back if they didn't realize the funds. After several more emails of them stalling, I finally called my bank and explained that I had paid for a service that I hadn't received. My money was finally returned, but it was a lot of effort for a $150 deposit. It just makes me wonder how many people they have robbed funds using this technique knowing that many Americans are trying to play poker and keep themselves anonymous.

The killer App for me will be something that will produce a BTC derivitive that would allow consumers to buy bitcoins pegged to a fiat money (i.e USD) for those that want stability and use bitcoins as a currency.  I buy $100BTC, I can spend $100USD on goods no matter what the price does in Bitcoin. It should also apply discounts that vendors receive by bypassing credit card companies to make buying things in BTC cheaper then other methods. Obviously this needs to be seamless and transparent to users.

Think of bitcoin like you would of HTTP.HTTP isn't all that interesting if you don't have applications like a browser and languages like HTML and javascript. But with those you have a platform for moving information, quickly and at almost no cost. Bitcoin offers us a way to move money instantaneously and at almost zero cost. Something our existing financial infrastructure can't really do, especially when we are talking about moving money internationally.  Personally I believe the future of Bitcoin will be more as a protocol where many applications are built upon it, with users having no idea that they are using the protocol to move money. What they will notice is lower fees and faster execution. 
Don't ever bet against a technology that can do something faster, cheaper, and better then the status quo.

I don't quite understand your concern here so I will discuss the two points at which a chargeback could occur and discuss the risk.
1) I make my list on Amazon and the buyer takes my offer and uses their credit card to buy my items.  Let's assume the buyer cancels his payment with credit card company at this point. Then it psoes no risk to me because my BTC hasn't been released. 
2) After I receive my goods and the BTC is transferred the buyer calls his credit card company to issue a chargeback. At this point it is like any other chargeback for Amazon, it will be between the buyer, Amazon (depending on service the vendor), and the bank. I don't see how this would put you (the amazon buyer) at risk. You have the goods. 
Perhaps I am missing some other risk that you or others would like to point out.

The block chain is far more then a historical record. If that was the case then a spreadsheet on Excel spreadsheet sitting on some server would suffice. But we all know why that wouldn't work. My original point is having a system of computers that can perform transaction in a trust-less environment with near 100% confidence has value.  Given the amount of money that companies pay intermediaries to perform this function, nothing to sneeze at by my measure.

Basically you are guilty by default. The bank doesn't want proof they act on suspicion. This is really why I love Bitcoin. No single government or business should be able to restrict or control who has the right to capital. To me this strikes at the heart of capitalism. And that is what we are talking about here.  In today's world if you can't process payments then you don't have a business.  And the list the author has provided just scratches the surface. Try promoting a product that threatens any of the status quo products of Tobacco (electronic cigarettes), Pharmaceuticals (herbs and ethnobotanicals) and see how fast you receive a "Dear John" letter from your bank and merchant account. You are high risk even if you were doing business with them for years without a single chargeback. No chance to defend yourself or file a challenge. You get a letter and then your account is closed. And it doesn't end there, good luck opening another account, you are flagged and it follows you for life with no chance to defend it.

I think that makes a lot of sense. As Pay Pal is a payment gateway and as such has to pay most of their margins to Visa and Mastercard on each transaction.

The exchanges will definitely want two chains as it will increase their trading fees.

Well banks are like any other company. If they can lower costs and gain a competitive advantage they will do so. Current clearing systems are expensive and very slow.

I would also agree. I am all for bitcoin but their is a strong case for consortium's to utilize their own blockchains as a digital ledger. A database by one central party is always at the control of that member. If they alter records it can be very hard to tell even with auditing which is expensive and not very timely. A distributed ledger solves this issue. It's main issue would be from a 51% attack, but this would be very easy to defend in a permissioned ledger.

I think you can't think outside the Bitcoin Blockchain. Multi sig is not something unique to Bitcoin. You can set rules for hashing however you like. There is nothing stopping a private blockchain for limiting hashing power to each miner. One could  set up smart contracts that require multi sig to increase the hashing power for any one miner to keep this decentralized. 
It is more immutable than a database controlled by a single administrator. Nothing is 100% immutable, not even Bitcoin. There is always a risk of a 51% attack. What we are talking about is degrees of immutability. And a private blockchain is far more immutable then a database which is manged by individuals rather than by consensus.
The question posed here was how could banks use a private blockchain. I am simply answering the question. It doesn't mean I agree it is the best course of action. To say that a private blockchain is the same thing as a central database managed by a single administrator is just wrong.

@_date: 2015-07-31 20:14:42
I would disagree with that statement. The whole purpose of the idea of a distributed ledger is that there is no administrator. This is why it is appealing to consortium or groups that don't want to introduce a 3rd party administrator or one of the members to be an administrator. With an administrator you will need an auditor which is neither timely or cheap in their opinions. A private distributed ledger could have a lot of value to a consortium that isn't interested in a currency function but rather are looking for a immutable ledger. In this situation servers could be set up with each consortium member which took the place of miners.  Rules could be set up that no single member could gain 51% of the hashing power. The issue I see with this is a question of economics. Yes consortium will initially go this route.  But I think they will find that setting up this environment and more importantly securing it, will be cost prohibitive when compared to well established and secure blockchains such as Bitcoin. It will take just one hack (51% attack) of a prominent consortium and I think you will see the whole tune change about a private blockchains. At the moment there a host of consulting groups trying to figure out  how to monetize the Blockchain. Obviously there isn't as much consulting fees for taking something already built. Classic build vs buy question. As in most early technologies companies go with a build solution first. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:30:43
Auditing is very expensive because auditors have to physically be present at the facility to audit the accounts. They have to ensure that the administrator or in this case the clearing house is not embezzling money and cooking the books. Or is being influenced by one member of the consortium unfairly.  In this case you have stakeholders from multiple parties that are interested to know if the info the adminsitrator is holding is correct. The banks, their shareholders, government regulators state and federal. Each of these have their own auditors. Believe me it gets expensive real fast. Costs are greatly reduced by the Blockchain because of immutably. Yes the auditor still has to audit the individual banks to ensure the transactions sent by each bank are valid, but the amount of auditing needed to be done on the private blockchain is minimal and can be done anywhere.
In regards to hashing power, it would be very easy to set rules in the private network to not allow any one, two, three, etc. miner to have more than x% of hashing power from a controlled pool. You could take it a step further that even multisig is needed to hash more than x%. You still need to secure the network from an outside hack (51% attack). Something I think most banks will find much more expensive than just using a public blockchain. There are others way to gain privacy in the blockchain besides building your own.

well I applaud your efforts to help promote bitcoin, but I can't understand why you would do anything that interrupts the purchase cycle. Drop off rates are already high enough for most vendors, sending someone off site is only going to increase those. I hope you are watching abandoned carts carefully.

A company that does over 1bn in revenue (mainly through credit cards) who isn't seriously looking at BTC to reduce CC fees, simplify the load and unload process for customers, and protect themselves from fraud, would seriously call into question managements ability.

Or one bad actor can hold you hostage to get your bitcoin without even needing to take you anywhere. For me this is the biggest issue with Bitcoin. It is just too easy to use intimidation to part you from your Bitcoin.

There is also Kraken if he was looking to pay lower fees or obtain a better spread.
