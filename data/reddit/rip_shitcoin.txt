Let's be more generous
Let's say there are 50,000 people like you
Let's say each of these 50,000 people invest their 10% of their yearly salary into Bitcoin, which I'll estimate as $50,000 on the average - so $5,000/year each.
$5,000/year x 50,000 = $250,000,000/year
That's no where near enough to sustain even the current price, because:
25BTC x $230 = $5,750/block
$5,750/block x 6 x 24 hours = $828,000/day
$828,000 x 365 = $302,220,000/year
That's right, at the current price of $230, Bitcoin bagholders are paying out $302 million a year to miners
Bitcoin is a zero-sum game, but with an extra leak to a parasite 3rd party - the miners. Bitcoin doesn't look so crash hot once you realize that overall, a single transaction costs ~$30 just in reward fees (no electricity or miner cost included!) and it's growing over time.

You mean like if large mining outfits like Cex.io announce they'll stop mining? Oh wait.. shit
The price wouldn't need to fall 99%, it would only need to fall below the level where electricity price begins to exceed rewards. This is already happening for Cex.io. No miner in existence can break even on electricity costs at a price of $100/BTC it seems, and most will probably fold at ~$150-$200.


Can you imagine developers and users with bags full of bitcoins agreeing on that? They can't even agree on minor changes, let alone something that could seriously fuck things up for everyone. They certainly wouldn't be able to agree on changes in a short number of days, which is what would be required as confidence in the system won't remain for long.
For instance, say you reset the difficulty to '1'. Those who get in first could get themselves thousands of BTC in less than a *minute* until the difficulty readjusts upwards. The current difficulty retarget time is 2016 blocks, so that's over 50,000 BTC that could be picked up in the blink of an eye. Think the bagholders will be happy about that? And you can't simply reduce the difficulty retarget to 1 block or a handful of blocks, because it creates a 'whipsaw' effect, where you have 1 extremely short block, 1 extremely long, 1 extremely short, and so on.
Altcoins have tried to change the difficulty to solve the problem of a sudden hash rate decline many times before, and the above consequences have happened. A hard fork to try and alter the difficulty has a good chance of being a complete disaster.

I thought you responded to my post initially, but you were actually responding to Elder_Yautja's response (unless it was aimed at me?)
My argument is that the difficulty drop will never come because the time to the difficulty retarget is 2016 blocks. If the hash rate drops by 99%, each block will take 16.5 hours. 16.5 hours x 2016 blocks = nearly 4 years to the difficulty readjustment.


Oh? Name me one miner currently available that can break even on electricity costs even at the price point of $100/BTC. I'm not trying to bullshit you bro, if you don't believe me, just go to [this calculator]( and type in '50' or '100' for 'Rate BTC to USD', click 'submit' and look at the 'Income per day' for all the currently available miners listed.

But the profit margin won't become bigger, that's the point.


Not true; If the price falls to $50, not even the most powerful mining machine in existence right now can avoid a net loss. And there's nothing stopping the price from falling to $50.

No it's not. The network could be running using no electricity at all, and the cost per transaction would still be $30, because it's a reference to the 25BTC reward per block and the price of Bitcoin, not electricity cost.
The cost to mine does not directly affect the price. There's nothing stopping the price from going below the electricity cost to mine; it would just mean that most miners would stop mining. 
The only indirect effect mining would have is that less money would be flowing out of the system if miners all stopped mining *suddenly* before the difficulty retarget because blocks would be found much less frequently, and so that decrease of money flowing out to miners may give some amount of buoyancy to the price.

They have to pay off the purchase cost of their machines and electricity. Most miners have discovered that they are unable to break even, and it's at the point now where even big mining outfits are turning off their machines because electricity cost exceeds rewards (i.e. Cex.io). And you can bet your sorry ass that Mr. Chang Lee isn't operating his warehouse in China because he believes in Bitcoin rather than fiat profit.


How is that relevant? The 25 BTC reward will still be paid out at a rate of once every 10 minutes, which at the current price is $302 million/year


That's if it does. If there's a sudden drop in hash rate of 99%, say due to the electricity cost of mining exceeding rewards, then it will take years for the difficulty to readjust because the difficulty retarget time is 2016 blocks. 99% drop = 16.5 hours/block = Nearly 4 years to next retarget.
