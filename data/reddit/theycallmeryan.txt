Because that’s the majority of these “investors”. I love crypto but believe cryptos to be overvalued currently because they are not good currencies (mainly because they don’t have a stable value). I’m not calling all crypto investors dumb for having a different opinion than me but there’s a bunch of HS or young college students who think that bitcoin/altcoins can “only go up” and that fiat currency is an inferior system.

I’m not brainwashed by the government, I’m just about to graduate with a degree in finance. You guys rightfully complain that people criticize bitcoin/cryptocurrency without knowing anything about it but it’s clear here that you’re criticizing fiat currency without knowing much about it.
A low level of predictable inflation is actually good for an economy because it encourages spending, loaning, and investing. Inflation also is a key indicator for the health of an economy/currency. When inflation (among other things) is too high or low, central banks will adjust the monetary supply to try to get everything back to “normal”. One of the flaws I’ve seen in bitcoin and other cryptos is that monetary policy controls don’t exist and the inflation/appreciation is unpredictable.
If you want to look into history, look at successful currencies in history, look into why the world embraced fiat currency, and look into the characteristics of a bubble. I love cryptocurrency but you’re delusional if you can’t see the bubble that’s formed or the pros of fiat currency.

What’s your evidence for this? Financial institutions have stayed away from bitcoin futures and I believe they aren’t allowed to buy other crypto due to SEC regulations.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:36:54
That’s not true lol if they have no idea how the market works, they’ll have someone pick their stocks or invest in conservative index funds. People on this sub don’t understand how markets work in general, I swear there’s gonna be a top comment blaming (((the Jews))) for the next crash.

Lmao this comment should be all the evidence you need to short bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:16:52
Saying facts isn’t called “being mad” they’re just facts. Look at the futures markets, big money is shorting, small money is long. Banks and other institutions are completely staying away. This isn’t going to work out well for the small investors.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:41:18
Either way, the vast majority of the money in the market is managed by professionals who research this shit (along with their bots).

There’s a lot more that goes into a currency than international trade. The first step for a currency is having a stable value and being accepted in a lot of places. Bitcoin is still not a good currency but it could get to that point.

I love that, according to OP, the only way prices can stay up is if the smart money stays away.

I've read a lot of dumb things but this could be the dumbest. Fiat currency's value is not going to be effectively worth zero. Even in cases of hyperinflation (such as Zimbabwe), central banks often will create a new currency and require the old one to be traded in for it for a fresh start.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:40:03
Yes, stupidity in markets is called a bubble and it’s what crypto is in right now. I’m not some crypto hater, I love the tech but I also think there’s no good valuation for it right now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:24:50
You’re right, there are many crypto focused hedge funds that put about $2 billion into crypto last year according to JP Morgan. This is still small pennies compared to what the massive hedge funds and big financial institutions would put in. Banks have stayed away from crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:10:15
Yup I agree with you. When the bubble pops, it's going to be awful for these Venezuelans and Zimbabweans who have been adopting bitcoin because their country's currency is in the toilet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:48
I know some guy who said he sold 100 BTC at $600. I think he has the right to be a little upset now lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:18
I’ve been trying to give reasonable points about bitcoin being a bubble and been downvoted on a few subreddits. No one wants to hear it. I love crypto but it’s all overvalued right now. Bitcoin is still overvalued at $11k but who knows what the market will decide the price is.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:53:46
Are you really trying to argue that bitcoin is a more stable currency than the dollar?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:52:53
I get what you’re saying but using bitcoin as an example, I think there are way too many speculative bitcoin “investors”. If the price stagnates or falls, it could trigger a massive sell off that would drive the price into the ground. If speculative investors think that bitcoin will not deliver a return on investment, they’ll sell.
But talking in terms of bubbles in general, look at the recent housing bubble. People were buying houses just to sell, there was a great supply of houses because (due to high prices) everyone wanted to sell their house. The bubble only collapsed when homes stopped selling because people collectively realized that they were way overvalued. Potential home buyers decided that they weren’t going to pay these ridiculous prices. Sellers would take out mortgages to buy the house just to flip it. They couldn’t afford these mortgages so they were foreclosed on eventually. The market collapsed basically overnight, just as it does with every bubble.

I don’t think there’s a solid metric to give a numerical value on a cryptocurrency but based on the high transaction fees, the unstable price, and the lack of merchants that accept bitcoin currently show to me that it’s only a speculative investment currently. I also have questions about what will happen to bitcoin once all 21 million coins are mined. I’m assuming there will be another fork but any good currency has to have some inflationary mechanism that can encourage holders of the currency to spend money. Right now I’m not sure if bitcoin could ever be widely used due to the lack of effect that monetary policies would have on it. The market would determine things like interest rates which could cause a lack of lending during a recession.
These are all things far in the future but those are some of the reasons why I think bitcoin in its current state is overvalued. I like that the community did a hard fork with BTC and BCH so hopefully as time goes on, the community can fix a lot of the underlying issues with the currency.

But people on here told me $50k a coin was coming soon

Bitcoin feels like the MySpace or AOL of crypto. It proves the technology has a future but it’s a huge bubble. I don’t know if it’s a controversial opinion here but an extremely volatile commodity that you can’t buy things with is not a good currency.
The more I read into cryptocurrency, the more interesting it becomes but there is definitely a crypto bubble currently.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:40:17
You think without big bad Wall Street this bubble would keep growing forever?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:09:43
This is what I’ve been telling people. Crypto is still so new and there are still a lot of problems with the underlying currencies (transaction fees, transaction times, potential 51% attacks, deflation when mining stops, no one accepting the currencies, the value being unstable, the list goes on). All I’m saying is the technology has massive potential but I don’t know if bitcoin in its current state is worth $10k+. People are treating cryptocurrencies like they are equity instead of a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:11:37
Untag him, this is dumb as hell. Bubbles pop due to demand rapidly falling, not supply increasing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:47:12
Listen I love crypto and I think bitcoin has some problems that need to be worked out but it has some potential (my main problem is that there’s no system of planned inflation in place but that’s a different topic). I would just read this sub and get pissed off at the arrogance of user’s valuations of bitcoin and the fact that they didn’t understand what makes a currency “good”.

Arbitrage is fun
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:51:10
I wonder if the bubble is finally popping. Last drop, it was clear that it would rebound but bitcoin is finally tanking consistently with no signs of recovery. It’ll be interesting to see.
I wanted to short it at $18-19k but I lacked the instrument. Oh well.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:19:12
Yeah you're right, I probably wouldn't have shorted something as volatile as bitcoin because in the short term, it could've costed a fortune.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:07:37
No I’m not, go check my post history if you want. I’ve been VERY clear that bitcoin/crypto is a great technology but it’s a bubble.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:05:22
In theory, the price will immediately rise to account for the anticipation of Ellen's viewers entering the market.
