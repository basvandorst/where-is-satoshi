Dude.. You won't have 10$ in 40 years doing faucets..
Better work an hour and buy btc. Saves you 40 years faucet clicking...
3215$ is the current price :)

You have used an online wallet.. Wtf is wrong with you?
Learn the basics before doing anything related to btc.
If you are not securing your coins, don't expect to still be in possession of them at a later time. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:41:11

No, you missunderstand what 51% hash rate does offer.
You can NOT do something which isn't accepted by the consensus rules.

If you are just redirecting traffic, it doesn't make any difference regarding security.
A LN wallet is as secure as any other wallet connected to the internet (desktop-, mobile-,..).
Except for web wallets.. Those are simply retarded

More seller than buyer = price declines.

You can buy accounts on the forum itself. Inside the digital goods section.
This site most probably is scam.

You can simply run core on an offline machine, or just don't allow it to connect at all.
And yes, this double setup is secure if your pc holding the priv keys is always offline. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:23:42
No, but maybe there are some  which do offer this. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:53:47
Sorry, please explain it again. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 04:34:24
This has to be implemented in the wallet layer. Not on the bitcoim layer itself.
This could exist, but most people aren't retarded enough, so it's not necessary. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 05:05:41
No reason why it shouldn't work.
You may have to code an handler to schedule the block chain access (especially with more than just 2 LN nodes) , but definitely possible.

Because people are retarded. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 07:16:53
They don't have to. But they have to live with the fact that a bank can keep their money in hostage (e.g. Look a t Greece).
So either take responsibility or live with the fact that you can't do shit. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 08:56:15
Yes, you can open multiple channels.
But 100 won't be needed since payments will be routed through any of the possible routes.
I guess 5-10 will be optimal.
And you will be able to rebalance your BTC between your open channels. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:24:40
You got a yearly wage of &lt;40k, right?
Nevermind, never intended to talk to non-educated people like you are. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 05:32:24
But there is no benefit in running 100 nodes.
What you usually want is a big amount of open channels, not nodes.
Plus, you need one IP per node to effectively connect to the network. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 05:33:04
What a shitpost
@_date: 2018-07-17 04:33:05

Are you already earning 0.01$ per day? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 05:35:54
Nothing, because it is not even open beta yet. 
Routing is free currently. No money-hungry monkeys in there yet, they don't understand how to install lnd. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:25:01
Look here: 
For example this one is selling 2 accounts: 
Trusted? Well.. I wouldn't trust people without a high trust score there.
If you buy something, use a reputable escrow on the forum. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 09:35:45
The only trustworthy mixer currently is chipmixer.
If you have used anything else, it most probably was scam.

How can people use shady scammy sites without any research? Being your own bank implies to use your brain..
