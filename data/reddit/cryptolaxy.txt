i chatted with the online support, once i told him about the issue he didnt reply me again.

Thanks you. Your method worked for me. Kindly check your PM. 
I was just wondering why coinbase will generate a compressed private key. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 11:38:06
what effect does that have with respect to importing private keys that starts with 7?
@_date: 2014-09-17 11:14:50
I already did that. But i noticed the private key starts with L while previous private keys that i have used with coinbase start with 5.
Could that mean anything?

I was able to uncomPress the private key using brainwallet.org
Thanks for your assistance. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 09:39:05
mine is a 52 character that starts with L.

Is it possible to have a miner include my transaction in their block? 
@_date: 2016-02-19 06:37:04
I sent the transaction from the blockchain mobile app. And it never gave me the option of including a fee.

Could this Bitcoin core 0.12 help my situation?
@_date: 2016-02-19 06:31:48
I didn't double spend. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 06:54:05
Is there another site you can recommend where I will see the actual priority of my transaction
@_date: 2016-02-19 10:23:24
I am definitely changing my Bitcoin client once this transaction is completed. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 18:01:43
Just an update, I tried checking the network propagation and it says "No inventory information available"
Could it be the transaction is invalid?
@_date: 2016-02-19 06:40:11
Yea. That's what it will seem like. The Estimated Confirmation Time	Very Soon (High Priority), Thought that will make it confirm sooner. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 12:30:20
Maybe I might be better off waiting. Loosing all that coins To a pool rep won't be a smart move. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 11:13:33
Yea. I just wasted a whole lot of my time. Though I am trying to see if I can get a pool miner to include the transaction in their next block then I pay a fee. You think that will work?
@_date: 2016-02-19 07:49:40
Lesson being learnt the hard way. ☹️
@_date: 2016-02-19 06:48:32
Yea. This will be my last transaction with them. Will it be possible to get a miner include the transaction in their block for a fee?
@_date: 2016-02-19 07:15:17
Just keeping my fingers crossed.
