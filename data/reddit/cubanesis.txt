I've never invested in anything, but bitcoin has been interesting to me since at least 2015. I talked my wife into letting me buy in at $15.5. That was about 2 weeks ago. So while I'm bummed that it's down now, I keep saying to myself "It's only been 2 weeks and it's only $300." 
I hope this is the right mentality. Just let it ride for a while. As a first time investor I'm still having fun and thinking "If I make a few buck cool maybe I'll go on a vacation" but if not oh well, that's the risk of investments. 
I put a little into litecoin too and obviously got BTC when the fork happened. So here we go!

So I'm new to this, bit committed to sticking with it. Forks however still confuse me. So, I am using coinbase for buying and selling bitcoin. Recently they had an announcement saying something about bitcoin cash being supported and it had some in my account. But now that I'm reading I'm seeing that there are several other forks that have happened, am I not getting the new for currencies because coinbase doesn't support them or do I not understand forks?

I'm going to do a show on TLC called "The Real Wives of Bitcoin" and it's just going to be all the stressed out husbands because the wives are like "Well I want to make money." 
Why can't they just relax and let it ride.

True Story, I bought $5 worth back in 2015 and totally forgot about it. Went to get more when it got to the $14k mark and everyone was like "It's going to 60K." When I tried to create my coinbase account it told me my email was already in use. A short password recovery later I discovered my $5 was now about $300. 
I put another $300 in around $15,500 when it was on the way up recently, so this week is a major bummer. I'm not cashing out yet though. I can stand to loose $300 in the long run, but I'm hopeful that it'll at least get back up to $20k. It better or my wife will never let me hear the end of it. lol
