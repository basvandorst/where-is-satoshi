I am flying to tokyo this summer. Can I cash out some bit coins to yen here? is that possible?

Am I simply doing something wrong?
Weird. According to this link it's not possible..
When I try to buy bitcoin through coinbase it says:
Sorry! Buy &amp; Sell not available in

Somehow making a new account got it working. Strange.  Thanks!

Dude, look at it from our POV. You're offering us 200$ per BTC. Really? There's a catch here somewhere that we can't understand. Either explain to us how this works and why it's worth your time to do it and maybe it'll help people understand what you're all about

I have 2.9 BTC I'd like to get off my hands. If you're interested can you PM me
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:41:23
Yeah I thought so. I'm at work anyway

He's asking about changing BTC to cash. How does that work? Do they deposit into your bank account or give you some kind of receipt to pick up cash at Walmart or CVS?

Well, I'm in the same boat. I am considering getting out with that got until whatever is going on wraps up. Blockchain does have a withdrawl. Also Coinbase does too. I haven't used any of them so i'd be interested in knowing if it's usable at this point

BTC-e is down i checked earlier
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:27:45
It's a blue button right next to DEPOSIT
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:13:07
Ah, didn't know you were UK. Apologies. I am NA. Try it out. If you do let me know your results

I have all my litecoins in an offline wallet using Litecoin wallet linked at the bottom. All safe. Now all I need is a damn exchange that actually works 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:54:36
There's even an App for Google Authenticator

the Email verification ahs been a problem at BTC-e for a long time. It never sends an email verification. Supposedly they've been told but never got to fixing it.

I have used them before transferring BTC from Block Chain. I bought some light coins. All of it in on an offline wallet. But I've never had a problem I guess recently they've been having problems

I've used Bit Instant Twice this week. once for 50 and then once for 500. Always got it within an hour after depositing money at Wal mart

Saving this information for later. Really interesting thank you
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:41:10
So we need to get 'another' email account to make this work? It never sent me any emails after I signed up. I heard it was broken

I used Blockchain to buy through bit instant. I've never had a problem. I just print the slip from bitinstant. Walk to walmart. Fill out the blue paper and pay the person. 15 Minutes it's in the Block Chain Wallet. The Fees are def high. I live in California and I noticed zipzap is in San Francisco. Maybe it's easier I don't know
