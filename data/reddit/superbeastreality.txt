How would I do that?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:44
It would have to go up first

You might find out who's behind it and get your money back.

Call the police. Don't let that happen to other people.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:23:07
It really did. Thanks for your answer.

Not a lot. Just dipping my toe.

I'm trying to set up a GDax account. I already have a coinbase account. It seemed to fast track me through the setup. It's asking me for an ID but I already uploaded my passport to coinbase. Does it need me to upload another ID? It wont let me select the passport option and I don't have another ID.

Can I ask if you use, or have used Exodus? Take a look at my edit in the original text.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:55:24
It's not working.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:40:05
Coinbase is down again?
