This was just an ELI5.
Look for SegWit vs. Bitcoin Unlimited discussions.
USAF means, "user activated soft fork". Look up soft-forks and hard-forks.
Network stability is stronger when there is consensus. It's unstable when there's contention.

The only thing that really matters is actually pretty simple. Forget disproportionate hashpower debates, forget disproportionate node debates.
If/when the chain splits there will be people who posses Bitcoin, and they will all have two copies of that Bitcoin.
Some will keep both, many will sell one or the other.
Everyone arguing about miners going to the more proof of work chain or the longer chain, and there not being enough hashpower on one of the chains to adjust difficulty fast enough, blah blah blah, it's all irrelevant.
I will be selling my coins on one chain and buying more coins (no matter how cheap they get from "a whale" dumping all their coins to influence adoption) on the other chain
***Adoption and demand from HOLDERS define the value.***
Remind me why there would be such a massive switch to the main proof of work chain?
Let's say in the first couple of hours after the fork, one chain is worth 25% of the original price while the other is worth 75%, why would all miners defer to the "higher priced" chain?
At some point there will be a financial incentive to mine that lesser hashpower chain just to dump the 25% coins, because you make a 10% profit doing that than working the larger hashpower chain.
It won't be this polarizing event and than a massive switch to the new front runner.
It will play out accordingly by the votes of holders who are invested in the longevity of this system.

I'll bite.
I present to you an invention of mine. It is a computerized invention and it is controlled by machine code.
It is designed in such a way that, so long as this code has energy to consume, it will continue to grow.
Let's call this invention a Worm. It's long, and it's skinny like any other worm, and the older it gets the longer and thicker it gets. **It stays rather proportional as it grows because it is most functional this way.**
It has a lot of unique properties, one of which is that it doesn't have a head, so unlike most *other* worms, if *this* worm splits into pieces, those pieces become new worms.
It also has a very cool defense mechanism built in, where if this worm develops a mutation of sorts (let's call it cancer), it automatically splits itself into pieces. The piece with the cancer will grow on its own, and it will consume more energy and grow at a faster rate because, well...that's what cancer cells do! But there's a catch...cancer cells don't abide by form, they are mutations after all, and faulty by nature. 
So as this worm with the cancer grows you start to see something quite odd take shape...the worm keeps getting longer but it never gets thicker! *roll Goosebumps credits*
Need I go on any further?
Now back to your simple question.
Why wouldn't business want to go with the longer chain that's consuming more energy?

You people are really working hard to over analyze my analogy.
Stay autistic The filter analogy isn't grandma bottling and selling water, it's her using cold storage to protect her savings. It just isn't going to happen.
The regulators are regulating Coinbase, not your private keys, ***but grandma won't be using cold storage***, she'll be using Coinbase and or alternative 3rd party "bank", and with that come's the price of regulation.
Whether you like it or not, some government entities are here to assist the people who can't assist themselves in every facet of life. ***How good they are at that or how corrupt they are isn't the subject of this conversation.*** Bitcoin solves that through transparency and lack of inflation and centralized control, ***but third parties will still be regulated.***
Decentralization is nice, but it implies everyone has the ability to store their private keys under their bed.
People want ***easy***. [I'll defer you as well]( and end this because it's futile if you still choose to argue against the inevitable future existence of Bitcoin banks and the demand for them by a large % of the population who don't give a shit about your hopes and dreams of a utopia.
Bitcoin provides the people who want freedom an option they didn't have before, while still allowing them to mingle with the majority who don't give a shit.
I'm on your side, but you're blind.

It seems like my posts are getting misunderstood, I'm not advocating for BU at all.
I'm simply saying the economic majority will decide, not hashpower, not USD bagholders, not BTC bagholders, but the people, and I believe that will result in BU branching off and losing all the velocity it gained.
I try to remain unbiased in my arguments so they can't be attacked in character, only in substance, but anything that isn't "FUCK YEAH SEGWIT / FUCK YOU UNLIMITED" gets instant downvotes on this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:27:41
The argument is that it's ***possible*** to split your hashrate into two separate pools, thus giving the appearance of a more decentralized hashrate, ***regardless of total hashing power*** of the bitcoin network.
I'm not arguing for or against this, but if you're going to to counter peoples responses to your original statement, at least address the counter argument without misconstruing (or intentionally ignoring) their counterpoint.
It ***can*** be faked, and I just explained how it's possible. It's actually pretty easy, especially when you own the main source of production for bitcoin mining hardware.
Align your defense accordingly.

Yes, I am projecting. Yes, I am generalizing. No, I'm not sorry, and no, OP did nothing wrong, I'm just latching to his comment because I realized that now that the gold parity is behind us (although its effects are not in the rear-view just yet) there are plenty of more mile-markers to go with real effects on the horizon.
Most early adopters in anything tend to have a couple of screws loose, it's what separates them from the rest of the hive and it usually causes their attraction in the new tech to begin with, swarming off to create this new hive hoping to grow, or maybe not hoping at all and just enjoying themselves alone in their special corner only to find out some other people have now also taken an interest in this corner and they can't run away from them any longer.
I browse a lot of social communities and you see a good volume of perceived idiots in all of them, but (or just bitcoin communities in general, to avoid any politicizing between here and both at fault...) among a few others have an exceptionally higher rate of autistic responses to certain things that oppose the secular hive-mind of bitcoin early adopters.
I've addressed responses like this previously in regards to the *"bitcoin is freedom, you must hold your private keys and you better hunt for your own food and grow your own plants too!!!!!!!!!!!!"* people...yeah and everyone should stop using Facebook and start using pseudonymous communication channels like IRC again...*"Hey grandma join my IRC channel I made for the family every Sunday at 4PM, we'll all be on after Church! By the way, sweet glock granny! Daddy tells me I can get my own when I start kindergarten!"*
If you're reading this and you ever made a comment that said something along the lines of **"gold parity means nothing, the market caps are completely different"** please...continue to do whatever the fuck you want to do, but I'm going to kindly suggest you take my advice: **You're blind to socioeconomics.**
It's not even something that needs to be broken down, it's a very clear-cut argument: You think gold parity means little-to-nothing, and I think it has a much stronger socioeconomic effect than you would like to think. The news coverage itself from a menial &amp; inaccurate headline is still coverage.
You probably also think Kanye West is a [douchebag]( and should [never]( tweet [again](

Don't take this the wrong way, but does no one look at the log charts?
Does no one realize Bitcoin is **NOT A STOCK**. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)
We are looking at a very very clear technological adoption S-Curve, you see it with all other technologies.
The only real question is, what is the total market cap?
For cell phones it was pretty much every person using it, and realistically, that's where we are at in society for most *major* technologies.
The internet is *still* completing it's S-curve for adoption rates and it will take a very long time to reach a point where growth slows down to being moot.
For bitcoin....we are still in the 1% of the 1%, don't lie to yourself or let your sheltered ecosystem of life make you believe "so many people know about Bitcoin".
What we are looking at in the price charts is a reflection of **real** and **fundamental** demand/interest/growth in this technology and all it's aspects. **People get too lost in the price falsification and original all time high of Mt. Gox**.
Speculators will speculate ***on top*** of the real growth. We may very well see a **huge** spike after this ETF and it may go to 5k give or take a **couple thousand** and then it will crash, it will look volatile, it will look unstable and people will scream "this is the end!!!", but I'll be right here, looking at the straight line the price has been following on the log charts and know we will never see $500 again.

No, BU is a hard fork. These signaling blocks are just that, saying "hey, we're ready to hard fork once enough of us signal", to put it very simply.
Nobody can touch your coins besides you. You have to sign your transactions. Don't touch your coins until separate wallets are established, then there's nothing they can do. Both wallets will be using different protocols.

I'll say it again: ***Implementing an indefinite increase rule sets an unknown precedent.***
If you don't like that go vocalize your opinion and see how many people you can get to follow you.
Then, when you get enough people, form your own group and try and implement your feelings.
Let us know how that works out for you.
This block size debate is a non-issue, do you guys really think the block size is ***never*** going to be increased to 2MBs?
It just doesn't have to be increased right now, ***we have a better scaling solution this time***, and it's not the lightning network (but that may be the next one), it's SegWit. Then, we we reach this "roadblock" again (barely a roadblock right now, price is going up), we either increase the block size, or the devs say "hey guys, we discovered ANOTHER scaling solution that doesn't mess with the integrity of the network, this is how much more throughput it gives us, we're rolling it out in the next distro.
***THEN*** when we reach this "roadblock" again...if we have no scaling solution, we increase the block size to 2MB, by that time, whatever has been implemented will have a compounded effect on throughput size.
It's really not that big of a deal.

Every Friday night my Boy Scout Troop 329 meets together for weekly boy scout meetings.
We go through procedures, follow a set of rules, work on merit badges, and plan camping trips.
One day one of the scout leaders think things should be run his way and voices his opinion. There's a strong objection.
Next week he tries again, this time there's *2 more* scouts who agree with him. The rest object.
The following week they show up and announce they will make their own pack within the troop and go work on things at their own table. Everyone else shrugs them off, every now and then words fly across the room.
This goes on for months, merit badges still get earned, promotions still occur, all the rules are still the same, but now this pack has a plan.
They're going to take their pack and make their own troop, but they are not calling it, for example...Troop 832. They are keeping the original troop name and claiming they are the ***real*** Troop 329.
But the Boy Scouts of America has no rules about this and they need to vote to keep the original troop name.
This vote is getting closer to 51% now.
If this happens, then we will have 2 troops, both claiming to be Troop 329.
*Everyone keeps their old merit badges, but any newly earned badges will only exist within the troop that you earned them in.*
**What this means for bitcoin users:**
**Antpool *may* be switching their vote.**
**If down the line, enough pools vote this way, everyone who has coins now has 2 sets of coins, one on each chain. If you spend set A, you still have Set B. If you buy more from Chain A, you won't have those new coins on Chain B.**

All of this makes sense in theory, but while addressing the altruistic aspect of perception the social forces have on the network, there is another aspect: ***Deception***
Deception, and your the use of the word ***attacker*** is what clouds this entire debate.
Consider a trojan horse, a wolf in sheep's clothing, or a virus that slips by an organism's immune system simply by having something to make that orgasm falsely believe this is safe. Or perhaps a thief wearing a disguise, or a government signing treaties but spying behind the scenes with an ulterior motive. Maybe a wife with the intent to divorce after she secures a couple of kids, knowing the house will be hers too when it's all over.
This is more a form in the universe than it is a possible concept. We see it on all levels of life, and it may be in its infancy, but these decentralized structures we are creating are the embryonic cells of a life form much bigger than us to come, but before I go on a philosophical tangent, back to the subject...
You're implying that the public has the ability (I won't argue whether it does or doesn't) to come to a majority consensus that "this group" is the attacker, and will successfully move away and block them.
I believe many Core fanboys would argue that Bitcoin Unlimited is a small minority, composed of 95% useful idiots and 5% conspiring bad boys who are working with Bitmain/Antpool/"majorhashholder.exe", all of which are being a very ***vocal minority*** giving the ***perception*** that they are a much larger than they really are, and slowly but surely switching more and more hashpower over to BU. This would give the impression of a slowly moving ***"real"*** change in consensus, thus hiding the "attacker" as a legitimate faction.
You may call that ***FUD***...I'm simply saying it's ***possible*** and there is no valid argument against it because it is a logical possibility.
All of this being said, I think the ultimate decider in this whole debate between sides isn't going to come down to hashpower at all. If the network forks the people who assign bitcoin value are the holders, and they will vote with which chain they sell and which chain they buy more coins on.
A bagholder on one side can dump all the coins they want to sway appearances of chain preferences during a split, but ultimately, the power of numbers will just result in many people buying cheap coins on the preferred chain and dumping their coins on the other chain.
We'll see how that all plays out.
No idea why miners would go with the "higher proof of work" chain, if that coin is worth half the price in the first 24 hours of the split. There will economic incentives to mine the less worked chain also, just to dump the coins you mine immediately, since it's easier to get some on a lower hashrate chain.

Regulation isn't just an on/off light switch on a wall. I'll try to elaborate a bit.
Consider Bitcoin a ***resource***, like water.
Water is free and unregulated...but it's also expensive and regulated at the same time.
You could wait for it to rain and collect some, or you could find a river a collect some. You'd be foolish not to boil that water though, do you have a pot? Do you know how to make a fire?
Some people still wouldn't even drink sterilized water, they don't want that dirt and dead bacteria in their system. Do you have a filter, or the resources to make your own filter? That requires a lot of tech...
Reverse osmosis machines can be expensive.
Distilling is an option, evaporate the water and let the condensation collect into a container.
Maybe the only source of water in your area is an ocean and some briny swamps that are salinated and you need to remove the salt first before you can drink it.
Do you know how to desalinate water?
Maybe you live in an area where it does't rain that often. Or maybe you live in an area where it hasn't rained in years and the government has put a restriction on how many gallons you can use a day.
Some places it may even be illegal to water your lawn during a drought.
But what if you're really thirsty and it's a hot day and you don't want to do any of this, AND you just so happen to live in Flint, Michigan? 
That's where Poland Spring comes in. They are regulated by the FDA, because ***selling things*** tend to require regulation.
Bitcoin is water.
Coinbase is Poland Spring.

It can get messy. If you control your wallet, pay attention, don't touch anything and come here, there will probably be a stickied thread explaining how to do it, and you'll end up with 2 wallets. 
You may even see someone make a wallet client that helps you manage both if one doesn't die out soon enough.
BU miners would be running rules that comply with the BU network, they would have no control over the Core chain.
What I would do before is consolidate your coins. They may be split up between multiple wallets, or addresses. Your wallet could say 1 BTC, but it may be split over 20 addresses. Take your total balance and send it to a single address.

If you think Bitcoin will grow to be this massively adopted, highly valued commodity and/or payment system and/or digital gold, without "bitcoin banks", you're a fool.
There will be new players to the game that get an early adopter advantage (like Coinbase), and there will be banks that transfer their systems over and restructure themselves around Bitcoin.
Coinbase gets my grandma and computer illiterate sister online and using Bitcoin.
You and everyone else like you with this mindset are going to slowly realize you're being left in the rear-view mirror.
I'll defer to an [older post of mine]( so I don't have to elaborate on it again.

To be completely honest I'm not that well read on the technicalities of this subject as it may appear. I'd avoid moving any of your coins during that time until the dust settles and there's some clear well constructed instructions put out by the community. Probably within 24 hours of the event.

The concept of scaling is ***not one dimensional**.
Setting code in place to force one aspect of this entity we call Bitcoin to indefinitely grow opens up the door and invites exploitation right in.
Actually...it yells out "EXPLOIT ME!" to the entire neighborhood.
Changing something like that sets a precedent you can never return from.
***Having the size "flex" is exploitable.***
Increasing throughput size too fast knocks the people who can't compete out of play and gives "the wealthy/privileged" more votes. It's the same concept as requiring a test to vote in an election, it skews the voting pool towards wealthy/more educated people, who happen to be a majority of white people.
If you can't grasp that concept then I'm done here, go place your vote, fire up a BU node, it won't end well.
Also, throughput doesn't have to just be increased at its base layer. The protocol can be built into ***layers***.
***OPEN SOURCE LAYERS.***
***LAYERS EVERYONE CAN USE.***
This further diversifies the network, it opens up throughput, it allows further expansion on top of this new layer for more growth and more throughput.
Growth will happen, it doesn't have be me a mandatory linear rule applied at the base layer.

Why 10 years? Why not 9? Or 8? Hey, look, We had it set to 10 at one time, then we changed it to 8 and saw an uptake on recovered bitcoin which "fixed" our economy in the short term (no long term vision), let's just change it to 6 years, everyone uses the internet...it's easy to do, since we already hardforked to set the 10 year rule we have the code in place, we could just back order those old wallets and instantly inject them into the market!
The problem with this is it sets a **precedent**.
This is huge when it comes to supreme court decisions and why many justices get a lot of hate for voting against something and wind up getting labeled many things.
Under-educated feelings and populism can destroy great structures.
When you ultimately decide that you're going to have wallets "auto-clear" their balances, you now open the debate for what that threshold is. **Threshold debates are problems.**
How much of a woman do you have to be to be allowed to use the woman's bathroom? What direction are you coming and going from? Were you once a man, or looking to be a man but still hang with your longtime friends in the girls room?
Do we eliminate separate bathrooms altogether? Or, do we give them a 3rd bathroom to play in? Both issues remove the "threshold" debate, but in turn one creates a new threshold debate...what about a 4th bathroom for who knows what? Or what if the 3rd bathroom gets labeled as "the weirdo bathroom"?
Justices have to think about all of this. Developers have to reciprocate this insight when they develop code, and devs who don't should be effectively "voted out" by users not giving their distro any use and educating other people on why. The ***real*** why.
We already have a huge threshold debate going on right now and I think everyone can attest to how much of a problem it has caused. Fortunately we have enough brilliant minds working on this issue so moving forward there eventually won't be anymore debate about block size once it's figured out, and there will never be a wallet auto-clear feature.
We're at a point where most of you fanboys, including me, really just need to step back and realize this is bigger than us and your simple solutions aren't that simple. This isn't your model train hobby you play with on the weekends anymore.

The incentive to mine and use your own resources to help power the network is a ***reward.***

I don't think this will be an issue long term, and I think every day that goes by decreases the centralization risk.
We could discuss how we get to the end result all day, but I think just looking at the end result vs. the initial configuration (Satoshi and a handful of idealistic early adopters / developers) and seeing the progress we've made so far when looking at pool diversity (even after factoring in "fake separate pools"), we're moving in a pretty linear direction.
END result? We're all robots.
More "short term" end result? Many big entities, including every country's government, corporations, idealistic groups are going to want a hashpower stake. Essentially the incentive will be having a voice and having security in the networks long term stability.
The UN can barely come to real decisions, I don't see there being any huge mass collusion behind the scenes to effect the network. 
Even then, changes to the blockchain "logs" would be detected. Address balances couldn't be edited. Protocol changes would be detected. Worst case, a hard fork scenario and there would be outrage and cries of objection.
Remember, at this point we're assuming it's a global currency. Changes by major parties would be consider an act of sabotage, countries financial futures rest on this stability and it would be considered an act of war.
It seems like a really far fetched idea, but given the circumstances that imply Bitcoins viability in the future, we're likely to see this scenario play out, minus the actual attempts to change consensus.

Of course. On the individual level there will be lots of disappointment, along with many people who come out with double their stash, maybe even more.

I responded to someone yesterday in regards to this and I think you should take a look at what I said as well:


























@_date: 2017-01-21 03:01:37
Let me preface my response with the fact that I don't expect you to change your mind.
Whatever you think Bitcoin is, forget it.
My grandma isn't going to be using multisignature solutions, but that's like saying my grandma isn't going to be using SMTP.
When she emails me on her iPod Touch from her GMail account, she's using it, but she's not hosting her own webserver and telling people to send email to her IP address or telling people to telnet to her server so they can chat it up all night about the weather down in Florida.
My younger sister won't be doing this either.
Bitcoin has some great properties but it's not this magic F.U. to authority with the words FREEDOM painted on the side.
All it does (to say the least) is allow people who want to be *free* the choice to do so without removing them from the system society builds for people who want things to be *easy*.
You're *free* to go hunt for your own food and live off the land all you want, but if you want *easy* food and *easy* shelter, you're gonna end up paying taxes on it. You also can't just find a McDonalds BigMac out in the woods, you're going to have to walk inside a McDonalds. Which is probably alongside a road that was built by the goverment that people travel on with vehicles regulated by the goverment to prevent (arguably) death and other unsafe conditions.
You can agree with the systems in place, or completely and utterly detest them. Chances are if you choose the latter and apply it 100% you won't be able to mingle well with society at all.
Here's the catch to all of this, Bitcoin, from a monetary perspective, allows this. That's what this thing is.
You might not like that, you might think everyone should work off of private keys. Like I said, I never expected to change your mind.
This doesn't change the fact that you need these people and these systems for Bitcoin to become viable. You won't get mass adoption without it because most people just want things to be easy.
The beauty is that Bitcoin allows both mindsets to coexist.
