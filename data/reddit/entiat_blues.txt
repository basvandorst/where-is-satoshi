pascal case is pretty common when it comes to software, not surprising to see it applied to something technical.

that's fine to disagree, what is a bit fucked is you trying to tell me what i said, when i said none of it.

that's a little insane to equate taxation to rape.

wow, you guys have really rung the retard bell on this one. war is a large process with many individuals making many decisions. there's actually no such thing as uncle sam, there's no one person you can point to and say yeah, that was pathological...

so, do we not study history in this sub either? patriotism, chauvinism, nationalism, slavery, ostracization, subsidies, in-kind wages, religion, tradition, and the outright threat of force are all time-tested avenues to power. again, fiat currency is a useful tool in every circumstance, but it's not a necessary element in bending a group of people to a particular action.

the government doesn't create wealth. it prints money. big difference there. are you sure you're cut out for bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:17:06
i'm saying it doesn't take fiat currency to make centralized power work. it's extraordinarily helpful, but there are other ways to accumulate power and exercise your will. ignoring that reality shows just how idealistic and unrealistic the bitcoin community's expectations are for the currency and the protocol.
@_date: 2014-01-18 06:35:55
it's not a non-statement. as it stands, cryptocurrencies are recognized more like foreign currencies, which implies difference legal and tax implications.

there's something pathological about your lack of nuance in your paranoid-fantasy version of Government.
@_date: 2014-01-19 05:27:45
it doesn't take money to do what the government does. it takes power and influence and incentives. fiat currency just happens to transfer and tally those things up in a fluid and effective way. getting rid of currency doesn't solve the problem of the abuse of centralized power.
it's that kind of thinking that makes the bitcoin community kind of a laughing stock.
@_date: 2014-01-19 05:32:48
i never said it was an ant colony. can you see how ridiculous that is? i say it's a process with too many actors to blame one individual singly as the pathological source of the issue. the problem with the kind of catastrophic events we wreak on ourselves is that they're not the culmination of pathological, irrational thinking, but the rational, sensible move given the circumstances and the desired outcome.
i'm getting real sick of the small-mindedness of the community. you would think people passionate about a new form of currency would at least take a moment to think bigger than some anarchic or libertarian talking points.

you and all those posters fail business and databases forever. incorporating with just a single british pounds tells you *nothing* about the parent company or the current state of its finances. and you can't just stop a live web service in its tracks to stop new registrations, unless you enjoy answering to that kind of service disruption to both angry clients and disappointed bosses.
shit like that is known as a career limiting move.
it was poor foresight on their part not having some way to throttle incoming requests for new user accounts, but you still have a long way to go to "treating people like shit."

it's this kind of bullshit attitude that's been chipping away at btc even before the gox scandal.

jesus, you're such a fucking tool. there's many, *many* layers of punishment before guns or even the threat of guns gets involved...it's almost like you have *zero* experience in business or finance.

great series of posts. the way you laid it out it starts to seems like there's certain amount of sense and reason to US economic policy.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:24:19
again, i never said the things you said i was saying. you've effectively decided to argue with a caricature of what i've said. that's pretty sad.
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:53:22
i don't things would change much. even without minting, the government could direct the states to mint and destroy currency. and i think most states would go along with it since a lot of our stability and isolation from the rest of the world is owed to the power of the central government.

so basically you're refusing to see beyond the fantasy you've constructed for yourself, and outed yourself as another bitcoiner who has zero real world experience with money, regulations, and getting along in this society?

the switchover to the 2400-point SAT was after 2006; i took the 1600-point SATs that year and for awhile had to explain that a 1398 wasn't as bad as it sounded.

you didn't get any sense of the nuance in US tax policy? at all? there's clearly some attempt somewhere in there to delineate different types of labor and economic activity and what should be their fair share of the tax burden.
it's interesting and illuminating to read about, but this whole thing about guns and murder does little but play into people's paranoid fantasies.
