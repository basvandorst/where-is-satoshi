My plan to continue buying 1%-2% of a bitcoin every paycheck is getting harder and harder.

Because regardless of the issues that Ebay has, the 15%-20% I pay as a seller is still less overheard than a brick and mortar and I get the benefit of access to millions of potential buyers.
Plus, Ebay has actually started making some improvements to the way they treat sellers. You still shouldn't sell an iPhone there, but for the stuff I sell, Ebay is the best fit.

Exactly. The dot-com bubble was this:
Website owner: Our website is pens.com. If you need a pen, you log into our site and put your address in. Then, we send someone to bring you a pen within 30 minutes or less!
Investor: How do you make money?
Website owner: We're not sure!
Investor: Great! Here's 10 millions dollars. Buy some office space in San Francisco and a bunch of Aeon chairs.

This is the mindset of someone who's 8 hours away from blowing their brains out in an Atlantic City parking lot.

If he waits 100 years imagine the glorious tomb he'll be buried in with all of his bitcoins and mummified cats.

I spent the last 10 years LOLing at bitcoin because it's weirdo libertarian gambling Chuck-E-Cheese tokens.
That said, I decided to buy BitCoins yesterday and bought some today. Getting in is incredibly easy, and if I lose my $25 a week, whoop-de-doo, I used to spend way more than that on smoking which was a far dumber investment.
