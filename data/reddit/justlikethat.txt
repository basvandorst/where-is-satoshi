You are smarter, you understand the value of Bitcoin and own some ;) Maybe you did not buy at the right time, but that was impossible to know. If it get big, you will get a car for one or two coins, look at it longterm.
That someone else will not be able to trust her, she was not single when she met him. He cant trust that not the same will happen to him. Sucker...
You are in the best age range, can date women from 20-50, depending on what you like, there are millions of women all over the world for you.
It cant get much worse, now it can only get better.
Better to happen now before you had kids.
Better to happen now while you are still 30 something.
If you have a kid, thats a perfect chick magnet.

Dont add Satoshi Dice. Blockchain.info will be targeted by authorities since it allows anyone to use Satoshi dice, once Bitcoin is bigger. 
This is reason enough for me to not trust Blockchain.info with any coins. A similar service without SD is needed. 
Also security is of high importance. Twofactor or why not even three factor authentisation for those who want.
Dont only use a .com domain name. Those are easily shut down also use and advertise another kind of domain name.

If you put a buy order or sell order in and wait until it gets filled, you will not move the price you will stabilize it. Currently around 30-50 000 bitcoins gets sold/bought each day, thats a value of  $ 1200 000. An order of $5-10 000 will not move the price that much.

What would happen is that a new different cryptocurrency would take Bitcoins place. Just like bittorrent took the place of napster.
Going after it will just risk making a stronger version.
They will probably not attack it first, thats a waste of taxpayer money but rather just outlaw its use like china outlawed QQ currency.
Most Bitcoin business is based in the US. This means that the US is a bitcoin rich country. If Bitcoin becomes an important internet currency US will have an advantage since it owns most of them. Outlawing it early on will put US at risk of missing the Bitcoin train. 
US lacks the amount of gold that India have. 
So they would probably rather see bitcoin than gold as a alternative currency if they where smart since lots of bitcoin business is based in US.
I think regulation is more in the line of what they would like to try first.
And there is no currency destroyed when you buy a Bitcoin, you are just moving currency from one hand to another. To someone who wants those dollars. Its not like the dollars vanish.

I sometimes play a little black jack on "provable fair" sites with best odds available. I can also play for very small sums which allows me to double down a lot on bitzino.
Since bitcoin dont have chargebacks it allows the casino to accept the payment and send the money back to me in the same day.
This allows me to withdraw my money as soon as I win, at once eliminating the risc of having money at a casino operator.

The "pseudonymity" of Bitcoin will be abused, just like any technology will be abused, cars, fire etc. Better to try and come up with solutions. With cars we made traffic rules, with fire we got firealarms etc. 
I think it boils down to if you believe that most people are good people and that the benefits of a technology outweight the drawbacks. I think most people are good people and one should think carefully before stopping a technology completely because of a few bad eggs. 
We did not stop cars because a few people use them to drive 200 mph.
But if you are unsure of the consequences to society, you can also slow down adoption-rate of a technology so you have time to study the effects.
Ofcourse effects can be different on different scales. 
A technology might mostly be used buy bad guys in the start, but later be used mostly by normal people in the end.
I dont believe there is so much abuse of Bitcoin, its not 100% anonymous after all. Less so than cash.
Its also a question of how much impact a technology have on a problem. Does it make it much worse or is it no big difference?
Will stopping Bitcoin end the problem or will it really not matter? 
Bitcoin decreases many problems, such as creditcard fraud, idtheft and chargeback abuse, bank accounts for poor people, but will also create some new ones.

So you know Pirateat40 real name?
@_date: 2013-02-22 07:57:26
No completely wrong.
On this log scale you see the growth rate back then and the growth rate of the price now. The price have to go way higher to be of similar growth to back then.
There was no even one cellphone client at that time. Today there are atleast three. No porn, no gambling no reddit, no mega, no wordpress, no 4chan, no bitcoinstore, no anything.

The research they reference misstook Mtgox adress which is an adress with coins belonging to hundredthousands of users as a single owner.
Even if there was one person/group Satoshi? Early adopters, who owned many Bitcoins do you think they would dump them on the market? Destroying the value of their own blood and sweat creation?
That would make zero sense. If you want to sell to get fiat, you do want to sell for as high price as possible. 
Anyone who sell lots by pushing the price down is someone who wants to buy more coins cheap so that they own even more when price goes up again.

Lets compare some markets.
There are $593,000,000,000 sent in remittance each year.
The market for virtual goods is valued at $16 billion.
Gambling market have a turnover of around $400 billion.
If Bitcoin becomes as valuable as FB, each BTC will be valued at $4761 each.
The total value of all gold today is $8,487,797,192,499.
If bitcoin gets the same value each coin would be worh $404,180
Bitcoin being the digital gold only reaches a single 1% of the value of gold.
Than each coin is worth $4000.
Now we also have the value of silver.
As for the black market, its valued at $10 000 000 000. If Bitcoin just gets  0,1% of that market value. Each coin will be worth $10.000.
As you can see there are plenty of ways that Bitcoin can reach $4000 and above in the comming 10-20 years.
So you can see that $30 is a bargain.
If you sell at $30 you are certainly selling to cheap.
What could it look like if Bitcoin is going to get more valued?
Facebook/google/skype etc took around 6-10 years to reach their current value.
Bitcoin have been out for 3-4 years that gives us 6 years.
6 x 365 = 2190 days.
Bitcoin prices need to rise at $2 per day! To reach Facebook value in 6 years.
If on the other hand Bitcoin rises with a dollar a week during 6 years it will give
you a price of 312 after 6 years.
If we go from 13 and $1 up every week we end this year at $64.
If you own 100 Btc your value will increase with $600 a week and thats still slow.

Clarkmoody shows you everything. Show the controls. Now you just have to set the "group price" by say 0.1 you might also want to set rows to display to 250.
Now you can also try to group price by 1 to see how many there are from $100 to $1000 there are currently only 7000 bitcoins ;)

I think you would be very wrong. Adresses that could be his have not moved. He probably cant move his/their early coins without revealing his/their identity, everyone would follow them to an exchange.

Get name.com to add Bitcoin. They were close, even had a questionnaire asking if people where interested in adding bitcoin as payment a year ago.

If 1% of all money invested into gold moves into Bitcoins, they will get a value of around $600. If bitcoins became valued as much as FB stocks each coin would be valued around $4000 if both $4600.
There are probably 20 other things that would add a couple of thousands to the value of the coins. But they can ofcourse go down. However there are not that many, only 100.000 can own 210 bitcoins. 
Only a million can own 21 bitcoins.
Get some, and if they double you can sell half of em. Now the rest will only be profit. Dont panic sell at a loss. Invest longterm like Warren Buffet.

Things change. You cant keep reality to a line. If there are lots of positive news such as recently value will go up it will not keep to your line.
