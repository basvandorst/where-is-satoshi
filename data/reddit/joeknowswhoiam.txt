You actually think people in the mainstream media are looking at transaction fees before calling it a Ponzi scheme? They just look at the price charts and see something they cannot explain on a financial level about something they do not understand on a technical level... so there can only be one explanation "it's a scam".
Bitcoin was called a Ponzi scheme way before fees reached the past few months levels, way before last year's influx of newcomers.

Moore's law does not apply to bandwidth **in practice**, the costs of changing/improving the physical infrastructure are way too high to evolve this much every few months. 
So yes even a linear increase can be detrimental to decentralization, which doesn't mean no increase is possible, but it should be done in regards of the current repartition of available bandwidth globally, so that enough locations can still potentially  be used to secure the network without implying mining at loss (which would be against the game theory principles).

@_date: 2018-01-08 12:12:19
Storage or even computing power aren't issues, Internet bandwidth is. It does not follow Moore's law due to the physical constraints imposed by the infrastructure necessary to provide more bandwidth. And bigger block will use a lot more bandwidth, this is why increasing block is a last recourse, it will happen when necessary and possible without decreasing the security of the network. This is when consensus will agree with block increase, last time it was probed no consensus was reached and BCH was created because the minority still wanted to go through with their plan although it did not convince the majority of the community.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:28:44
Yeah I'm using a bit of a slippery slope argument on that last point I admit, only future will tell what BCH's community (active participants in the network) will agree to do.

Maybe be cause they realize that full nodes are essential for a truly decentralized network? If there were only mining full nodes to transmit transactions/blocks and verify that they respect the consensus rules there wouldn't by any "check" in place for them and it would make the system heavily relying on their honesty (collusion is harder to achieve with parties that do not share the same incentives as you).
As for your security concerns, while not really easy (it involves using the console last time I've checked), it is possible to sign your messages offline using Bitcoin Core too, so you can safely store your private keys offline and not use them directly on your full node.

The most hypocritical part is how most of the exchanges blame Bitcoin developers about not being able to scale quickly enough (some by pushing unsustainable scaling solutions for their short term profits) when they petty much all crumbled under the pressure as soon as a lot of new customers requested their services.
Did they even have any scaling plans in place at all? It does not seem like it. For lots of them the current "solution" is to just stop the influx of customers by disabling signups, talk about a way to run a business... I honestly expected better from professionals in the financial sector and I can't wait for the day we have efficient decentralized exchanges (I'm aware of bisq, it's still impractical for new users).

[Here's a complete guide on how to do this in Electrum.](
Note: It is also possible to use the "Segwit wallet" option of Electrum when creating a new wallet, this generates "native" Segwit addresses (bech32), which start with "bc1" instead of "3" (P2SH-P2WPK). This format is not as supported as the P2SH-P2WPK format yet, for example you can't currently withdraw funds from Coinbase to a bech32 addresses (that's a Coinbase problem, not a Bitcoin limitation). But bech32 addresses have other advantages and will most probably become the standard addresses once they become more widely adopted.

At the current scale it will be the cheapest and easiest way to interconnect two networks. Many altcoins are working on LN implementations for this reason with the bonus that it will make them scalable too. You are right, it isn't required to achieve atomic swaps, but it's just a no-brainer to go this way.

If a portion of these returns happened because of a potential scam (USDT) it does not imply that the underlying currency is a scam as you seem to suggest. You do not call the US Dollar a scam because people are able to currently run Ponzi schemes using the US Dollar as their base currency, do you?


Exactly how much do you figure it represents? If you compare the amount of circulating USDT versus the whole Bitcoin market, it looks like a really insignificant share. Sure it would suck if it turns out it is a scam, and it would affect a lot of people, but how would any of this be caused by Bitcoin?

Unfortunately some people will lose some of their asset's value in the process, but it is the only way some people learn.
Plus the open-source and permissionless aspects of Bitcoin makes this a somewhat desirable thing to happen at some point. Bitcoin never had a contentious fork before that, we have been able to see how resilient Bitcoin is during this one, and it is pretty resilient. BCH had many supporters, some decent hash power at its start, well funded *influencers* and a lot of publicity... yet it didn't achieve much in terms of replacing Bitcoin.

I had actually never heard of this one, so I've googled it, thanks. It seems pretty rarely mentioned and just [*coined* by a tech journalist]( it does not seem to have a very bright future ;)
But that is besides the point, theses discoveries are not implemented for general use after few months like integrated circuits. It takes multiple years because they are just too costly to deploy in terms of **infrastructure**.
The larger blocks become before these discoveries and investments in infrastructure are available, the more centralized nodes and mining nodes will become at the cost of a less secure network. You can gloss over this fact and pretend it's not an issue because your main issue is "muh' low fees" in the present, I am more concerned about keeping the system as secure as possible, that is where the value of Bitcoin resides primarily.

Then miners in other jurisdictions will take their place, if the delta in hashpower isn't unbrearable after that the difficulty will adjust at most after 2016 blocks, if it is Bitcoin might need a fork.
Also if the laws attempt to force them to change consensus rules to something that doesn't fit the will of non-mining economically active full nodes, they expose themselves to ending up on a different chain without said economical activity (miners will generally follow the economical activity, this is how they are getting paid, through fees and they need their rewards to keep their value for 100 blocks at least). This is why it's important for people to be able to run nodes without high bandwidth and hardware requirements.
Many other cryptocurrencies neglect this aspect and think what matters is having a "cheap" and "fast" payment method with a lot less censorship-resistance and completely rely on light clients/SPV clients (some even claim non-mining full node are useless). But they are in it for a big surprise when actors like Facebook will arrive with similar "cheap" and "fast" solutions, 2 billions users, thousands of engineers, marketing teams, legal teams and big "associates" (like MasterCard/Visa/Paypal). Their value proposition idea will turn to 0 real quick when faced with such competition.
Meanwhile Bitcoin will still be censorship-resistant and decentralized, two properties projects like Libra are far from ever achieving, even if they fulfill their "paper" promises they will never work toward a system with strong privacy which is what Bitcoin developers have been focusing on for years now. People who do value these fundamental properties (and currently choose Bitcoin over many other currencies for them) will stick around. Bridges between those other solutions and Bitcoin will be built eventually.

It also implies that the ideas at the source of Bitcoin are set in it's code and can only be changed with consensus. Whether they understand/accept them or not is irrelevant, the minute they accept to buy Bitcoin, they promote theses ideas.

bech32 addresses aren't *a new thing*, they have been introduced almost 2 years ago, were well researched/tested before being included in Bitcoin obviously, and have since also been widely implemented/tested by [many similar and larger businesses]( than Bitstamp successfuly.
They are not just *careful*, they are late to the party and it's a shame for them and their customers which are losing out on potential savings when transacting on-chain. They are also missing out on [additional security]( (read the breakdown by address types at the end of the post).

Electricity production and distribution are under heavy influence of governments in most counties, sometimes even completely controlled by it. Without a lot of electricity there is no significant Bitcoin mining happening on the scale we're currently at. So it's easy for governments to monitor/regulate big consumers (large mining farms) and even shut down their operation if they want.
But in the grand scheme of things Bitcoin doesn't really care, it will continue to get mined in other locations/jurisdictions and if it doesn't continue at this scale the difficulty will adjust with less miners. That's why people say they cannot regulate it/ban it. Unless you believe all governments around the world can simultaneously agree on banning this use of electricity on all scales which to me seems politically improbable and technically unenforceable.
If this improbable dystopia ever happens Bitcoin would most likely move on to another security model than Proof-of-Work working under these new constraints. At this point those limitations would also apply to all other cryptocurrencies so the clear advantage PoW has over Proof-of-Stake for example would not exist and it would be more viable... but in my opinion those scenarios are really unlikely.

I had read about the finality of the roadmap item you were talking about, I just failed to see how it would fix transaction malleability.
It clearly does not and I guess Bitcoin Cash will just have to live with it or hope for a "quick fix" that nobody else figured out yet... 
It's a shame because someone could start attacking their network and cause incidents like the one that happened with Blockchain.info and Bither (which resulted in double spend transactions).
Meanwhile people using Segwit addresses on Bitcoin's network are completely safe from these kinds of attacks... I still find it mind-blowing that BCH think it isn't a priority to fix this.
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:37:23
This one is also pretty straightforward: 
You can't tweak the fee itself as it uses very recent transactions to estimate a rate that makes it very likely that you will be included within the next few blocks. It has the advantage that you can simulate the input/outputs to estimate the size of a transaction too.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:13:27
Because a non-contentious hardfork solution could not be found after two years of debate on scaling issues and security issues such as malleability are a priority on Bitcoin's network. Segwit softfork is the compromise that was able to gather a majority and helped us reaching consensus to move forward. It is a security fix to those willing to participate with Segwit addresses and introduces scaling possibilities/solutions. 
FlexTrans was not chosen because it was much younger, less tested and required a hardfork which also implied a lot of code modifications for all the wallets, exchanges, etc. from third-parties.
The optional nature of Segwit make this transition much smoother on a large scale and gives some breathing time to developers of the whole ecosystem. Of course if you look closer the temporarily increased fees and the limited uses cases that arose because of the influx of new users at the same time might confuse people into thinking that the implemented solution does not work, but it would be assuming that Segwit was a solution for the whole scaling issue, which nobody claimed it is, it's a step toward scaling. Just like BCH made a step with their hardfork, increasing blocksize and they plan to make the same step indefinitely even at the cost of making it a centralized system.

Coinbase is most likely the most popular one which does not fully support it, they still have P2PKH (1...) deposit addresses. I know they do send funds from native SegWit addresses sometimes (by experience), no idea if they do it consistently though.
[Most exchanges]( allow you to withdraw to native SegWit addresses nowadays, but it doesn't mean they internally use SegWit all the time.
There's a list of wallets too on the page I've linked. Just note that some might support SegWit transactions with P2SH addresses (3...) but not support native Bech32 addresses (bc1...). But honestly if a wallet pretends to support SegWit by now they should support the native addresses.

I don't know if the general public's opinion of Bitcoin has yet reached the point where it's seen as a refuge, from my experience (and yes it's anecdotal) it's vastly considered as a very risky/too volatile asset for this.

[Here's a good live visualization of how miners handle transactions]( and how fees evolve.
On the left are the transactions currently in the mempool (the transactions that aren't in a block yet but have been propagated on the network). On the right the ones that were mined recently. If you click on blocks you can see the current distribution of fees in them.
Miners will generally choose the transactions with the highest fees first (more profitable for them) and since there is a limited space in each block the offer/demand mechanism at play creates a fee market. So users set the fees for their transactions based on this data according to their needs to get into a block (they might not be in a hurry and pay less, or want to be sure to be in the next one and pay more). It's rather unstable/unpredictable because the demand fluctuates a lot throughout the day and the offer is basically the same over time.
Fee estimation algorithms in wallets attempt to do this job for you and predict the trend of fees within few blocks, but they are subject to the same parameters and can have a bad influence on the fee market. For example interpreting the data of a peak in demand incorrectly can lead to many users overpaying their fees and pushing the trend up although there was not much demand after this peak, so it's really hard to find that sweet spot consistently when you tweak such algorithms.

If you think about it some more you'll realize he most likely holds this controversial/radical view ([based on credible calculations]( because he knows that even if it has low chances to ever gain traction it will still get people's attention on a serious issue threatening Bitcoin's censorship-resistance.

Luke isn't "delusional", his proposition was a provocation to make people aware that there is an issue with IBD and how the effective block size has been increased (with SegWit) ahead of what the technology currently affords us globally (i.e. not just in very affluent areas and in laboratories) for Bitcoin to preserve all its desired properties. Communicating it this way ensures that he won't be ignored, he might be dismissed by shortsighted people but those would have ignored the warning anyways.
This issue will affect the probability/ability of people to run full nodes in a near future if we let it get out of hands. [His recent presentation]( gives enough details and calculations about this for it to be taken seriously.
On the other hands, commenters like AVirtualDuck provide absolutely no data to support the sustainability of their desire for higher limits. They generally speak from privileged positions where they don't have to use Bitcoin in adversarial conditions, with very limited bandwidth, with datacaps, etc.
Those are the kind of conditions which actually test Bitcoin's availability, censorship-resistance and are the ones we must care about above everything if we want Bitcoin to be trustless on a global scale. Until these people provide data and solutions for Bitcoin to work in these conditions at the scale they think they can achieve, their **opinions** can be dismissed. Most of them already switched to some centralized altcoin anyways where if they ever manage to fill blocks they see their full nodes count melt like snow in the sun.

So a 7.5€ (minimum) to 300€ fee for a SEPA transfer from those countries? Maybe I'm understanding this incorrectly? If not, what would justify this additional fee? All the other exchanges with which I've used SEPA transfers didn't have any additional fee up until now.
I've tried to contact their support but they are experiencing high demand right now... Anyone would know the answer to my previous questions?

Nobody guarantees you any return on Bitcoin aside from the financial freedom it provides you. If you decide to speculate on its value in fiat it's your own problem. You can enter and exit Bitcoin anytime you want and you are the only person who can decide it if you own your private keys.

Maybe this is the reason why you find it irrelevant, comparing apples to oranges is a hard thing to do but I was challenged to do it by the person who suggested Ethereum. So I've picked on something that is comparable with facts between both of them, the effects of their network's security practices on their actual users. This feature of Ethereum's network allows insecure code to run, Bitcoin purposefully refuses to include this feature for this exact reason. I do not deny the use cases of Ethereum, but to handle money it is just way more risky than Bitcoin and it has lead to lost money due to its intrinsic features.
But OK, maybe we shouldn't compare them then... So let's look at another coin that has a long and clear record of impeccable security like Bitcoin, can you mention one? I cannot unfortunately, all the altcoins that try to claim this are just making promises currently and I am not going to be their guinea pig when there is a solution that has been thoroughly tested and is still under active development (with envisioned scaling solutions even if they aren't immediately rewarding).

At which point they will collect fees and taxes before you leave.
I honestly don't care about this "taxation is theft" *bullshit*, it makes me cringe every time I read it because they never offer any alternative to build and maintain society, and make it progress. Some of them will offer you to switch to anarchism although every experiment in this area always fails when they scale up and are consistently outperformed by the fucked up system we have now.
But the logic behind their reasoning follows from their point of view... so it's pointless to call them out on this, just ask them for actual solutions without taxation, to which they always come up short. At this point it always feels like they liked the sound of "taxation is theft" so they repeated it, hoping they wouldn't have to pay taxes next year.
If you want to poke fun at them though just tell them it's technically not "theft", it's extortion and you do receive forms of compensation for it (social services, infrastructure, education, healthcare (in some places...)). A thief rarely come around and clean your windows or does the dishes after the fact.

Why do so many people think the current state is the only possible outcome of Bitcoin and that it is a finite state. It's just insane, it is never what developers are going to settle for, they keep trying to improve it in a secure and decentralized way within a programmed and verifiable consensus.
You talk as if there weren't currently hundreds of projects related to Bitcoin which work in its current state and among them many intend to improve the current state to make it scale and transition (again) into a useful currency for small transactions.
But it's never enough, you want it now, on the spot, or else it's not good for anything and should be thrown away... if it's that way then you should do it, dump your Bitcoins and let the people who really try to change the way we use money (among other things) do the work they are already set to do, it will be done with or without you.
Just to be clear, it does not mean people cannot express their discontent, but claiming that it cannot change is really ignorant.

Bitcoin Core is the wallet implementation developed by the core development team of Bitcoin. If he's so annoyed by people not using appropriate terms he should refer to what he called "Bitcoin Core" by it's actual name: Bitcoin.
The consensus has been reached by the parties involved, they "voted" for the Segwit implementation made and tested by the core development team. They cast their vote by running this software and not another one. Whether Roger Ver agrees or not isn't relevant, it's a fact and it is also described in the same whitepaper that he pretends to *defend*, but he and his supporters conveniently ignore this part of the whitepaper as it doesn't fit their narrative.
He thinks he can cherry-pick whatever "makes" Bitcoin in a way that fits his vision, when it's an actual community effort to define this and these decisions are made through consensus.

It's true when the switching cost to another technology does not imply losing the core values you find in the original product. There is a long list of superior technologies that arrived after an original creation which have miserably failed in history. In the hardware world: BetaMax, LaserDisc, MiniDisc, etc. In the software world: BeOS and Lotus Improv come to mind. And it's funny because these superior ideas once they have failed are often deconstructed by the winners and their best traits are implemented in the original idea.
I don't claim to have a crystal ball and that these cases apply to Bitcoin and the numerous existing altcoins, but your affirmation that a superior technology will replace an existing technology is not verified all the time in the digital world.
I have a challenge for you too, can you name one single cryptocurrency that has endured as many attacks as Bitcoin and still proved to be resilient, secure, decentralized and censorship resistent for as much time as Bitcoin has?
This is a core trait of Bitcoin, and any successor will have to reach this level of security to convince me that it has a bright future. The potential contenders like ETH, while still young, do not have a great track record for starters (DAO hack, Parity bug). Most other altcoins are so young that they haven't fought any war yet. Bitcoin Cash has inherited a part of Bitcoin's history after the fork, but it has to prove itself just as much since it claims to be different. It will only be tested if people choose to use it, but the switching cost (risk of being on a young network) gets higher and higher the more money you intend to store on it, and I doubt a majority of the cryptoenthusiasts are willing to take these risks. I can obviously be wrong, maybe people take security way more lightly than I do ;)

1. Fees are high so people holding Bitcoins prefer to wait until they go down to move their coins to Segwit addresses.
2. Lots of people involved in Bitcoin have no earthly idea about the mere existence of Segwit, let alone what the benefits are.
3. Many of the same people keep their Bitcoins on exchanges and popular exchanges like Coinbase currently delay suppoting Segwit to concentrate on badly launching new coins on their platforms instead (that's a bit specific, but it's the most recent event that demonstrate priorities of big players on this market).
4. Moving your coins is never a riskless operation, people delay this operation until it is really necessary for them and prefer to endure potential high fees in the mean time.
All of this make a bad playing field for adoption unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:07:07

@_date: 2017-12-15 16:18:34
I think those are some of the reasons. I do not claim to know all of them, feel free to complete/correct me:
* Moving coins to Segwit address(es) is not a risk-free task:
  * For people who intend to hodl, the risk and current fees outweigh the reward currently, unless they need to move their coins for other reasons.
  * For people with really small balances, the proportion of fees to do that is currently discouraging, especially if they do not want to immobilize their funds for too long.
  * For people who keep their funds on exchanges (notwithstanding the inherent risk of not controlling their own private keys), the risk is handled by these third-parties and only they will decide when they want to support it. The reasons why they'd refuse to invest in updating their software to use Segwit addresses for deposits and withdrawals are not public usually, some of them already support them, larger players (Coinbase for example) claim that it is not a priority according to their customers which isn't really a verifiable statement. It is a business choice and they are free to handle it their way, these fees are reported on their customers ultimately, so until they have competition that supports it, they might just prefer the status quo unfortunately. Mind you it's the same in many other businesses/industries. 
* In addition to the risk, the task is not very user-friendly currently. A limited set of wallets support them, not everyone is willing to change their habits with software on the spot.
* Finally a lot of users do not have any idea at all about this issue and the possible (temporary) solution that is Segwit. They just accept these fees as part of currency... which ultimately is not good for the image of Bitcoin, but educating people on these issues is not an easy task.

You summarized the situation pretty accurately, thank you for being pragmatic in the midst of all these post from panicked *investors*.
I have the same analysis as you and I am also a developer, but I have worked on open-source projects before (not sure if it's your case) and the mentality you describe for tech companies (which I've experienced first-hand too), in my experience, never translates into sustainable *long term* products/solutions in the open-source world. The imperatives of such projects are much different than the ones required to make a startup profitable, developers who give their time in open-source projects often are volunteers or they are paid but could be paid much more doing other projects in more traditional industries.
A globally distributed open-source development team, for a project that is also used globally in production cannot change direction as fast as your usual startup projects. And this situation is also exacerbated because these developers are dealing with their end users money directly, so they have to be even more careful when they take decisions.
While I totally understand that some people want things now because what is described to them sounds really awesome, it is just not possible to deliver it in a hurry. We can't go back and forth continuously on the matter of blocksize for example just because the project is suddenly very popular, it would not increase the incentive to develop second layer solutions quicker (the incentive is already present and implementations are currently in tests). It would also imply hardfork(s) which would increase the workload for the developers of the whole ecosystem (SPV clients, wallets, miners, etc.), not just the core team... This is not a resource the community can waste and expect to renew by throwing more money at them while forcing them to do something they are opposed to in the first place. Finally those hardfork(s), even if they are not contentious, have the potential to split the community even more than it is currently and that wouldn't be productive at all as you can imagine. There is a roadmap, and it is planned to happen at some point, but only when it is considered as safe and useful for all the parties involved, not just when it is convenient for new adopters.
My position is that we have to let time and the market settle this issue (while obviously continuing the development of the currently envisioned solutions). I attribute the recent price decrease to a loss of confidence in cryptocurrencies in general based on the inefficiency of Bitcoin to transact for low fees. But I do not think it is a bad thing. The system is not currently scaled appropriately for all the people who recently put faith in it, not because we do not want to welcome these people but for valid reasons : decentralization/security and sustainability. Since it is a free market everyone was welcomed inside anyways, and unfortunately when they realize that it's not what they expected, they leave the space or move to other coins which can provide them with the instant gratification/services they are looking for because these coins are years away from having the issues Bitcoin currently endure with scaling. We can only hope they will come back when our *house* will be large enough for everyone, but compromising our standards of security/censorship resistance to satisfy them immediately is not and will never be a solution in my opinion.

This "kind of second layer things" happened because Ethereum is turing-complete, something Bitcoin purposefully does not feature, so intrinsically it is a network issue to allow insecure code to run. The fact that they solved the issues with hard and soft forks of the protocol is a testament to this, if it was only the responsibility of third-parties, these thrid-parties could have solved these issues. The fact that people chose to favor Ethereum instead of Ethereum Classic just demonstrate which one is more secure after these forks.
About the block size, 1MB is arbitrary, nobody can deny that and if you step back and follow the development of Bitcoin you'll notice that:
* It's a size at which developers were able to [test the fee market]( and those tests were conclusive. It is possible for miners to earn money through fees along the way even with the halving of rewards. This incentive for miners is important to determine if they can make the necessary infrastructure investments.
* It's a temporary limit and larger blocks are on the roadmap when they will be:
  * Useful : it would be the case right now to lower fees, we can surely agree on this, but as far as I know it would require a hard fork, which if not contentious would certainly take some time to setup.
  * Necessary: it is debatable/subjective right now depending on your short or long term goals.
  * Not hurtful to the protocol's security/decentralization: it currently is hurtful for decentralization when there is already a trend of mining centralization with the current settings and no alternatives that are ready for production (sidechains).
These conditions are not OR-like, they are AND-like and as long as they are not verified it is too risky to steer the project towards a block size increase. Bitcoin had such an influx of users recently but it is not ready to welcome them. This success is due in part to the efforts to maintain it decentralized in my opinion, even if a lot of people do not notice it, it's one of the reason of the longevity of Bitcoin. It is something a lot of other coins consider as a *nice feature* but completely secondary... We will see how secondary it is when governments and central banks are going to take cryptocurrencies seriously and try to eliminate or restrict them, without censorship resistance we are not going to change money.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:31:54
Sure, then we'll keep making blocks bigger and bigger along the way as mass adoption occurs. Until only a few select entites will be able to run nodes and mining nodes due to the size of the blockchain and the bandwidth required to validate transactions...and then we'll have a *great* network of entites which we will have to trust... in our trustless protocol, this sounds like a bad plan.

I'm shaking if it wasn't clear from my previous answers /s
Since we're at the point of giving advice, take a step back and consider that there is rarely one solution for all the problems and that both these technologies are trying to achieve much different things (and some common things). They can co-exist without hindering each others... Like TCP can co-exist with UDP and even rely on it at times (feel free to attack this analogy on technical details if you want to overlook the big picture).

Of course you don't expect companies to publish this on the cover of letters they distribute with postal services, I agree with OP that only scumbags would leak this kind of financial information this way.
But I honestly never have any expectation of privacy if I share this kind of data with any company and nobody should have such expectation. I know too well what happens to them and how it's generally stored, it's bound to get hacked/leaked or sold to the highest bidder.

Electrum 3.x also [supports native Segwit addresses]( (bech32). Be cautious that this format (addresses starting with "bc1") isn't the transitional format (addresses starting with 3) and it might not be supported by your exchange (i.e. Coinbase does not support this kind of addresses yet, although they would be perfectly valid).

I'm also skeptical that this is happening right now on a big scale. On a more local scale though, I have read about people favoring solar power to run their mining equipment and people capturing heat from their mining equipment to heat their house. These moves are motivated by game theory, it's in the best interest of miners to look for the most reliable and cheap energy. While coal might be cheap, relying on governments sponsored power plants will not be in their advantage the day these governments will try shut them down for political reasons for example.
We are also talking about radically changing the way the banking system and hopefully much more work, if it takes "wasting" (I hate using this word, but it's the one most detractors use) energy to bootstrap theses changes I feel that it is not done at pure loss for the humanity.
This might sound a bit idealistic, we are talking about global effects of a global project, its repercussions also apply to this scale. When you choose to transact with Bitcoin you implicitly support these changes as they are very likely to happen due to the principles of game theory.

You're completely right that the OP did not use the right word when he said "steal" and that BCH doesn't "need" Segwit's code, but BCH still [needs to fix malleability to use Lightning Network]( the way the current implementation**s** are done.
So it will either need a soft fork as Bitcoin did in August, or a hard fork if their solution requires it. Those are not innocent changes and imply risks, development and testing time. Unless they invent a miracle solution it will also require adoption.
Finally copying code without understanding it is also pretty risky, BCH purposely chose not to integrate Segwit for undisclosed reasons. Maybe they thought it wasn't necessary to give this option on their network, maybe they did not understand its implications and the possibilities it provides or they did it ideologically because Segwit wasn't planned in the 2008 Bitcoin whitepaper... I've read the last reason few times and to be quite honest for a project of this size, if its author had planned everything (especially in terms of scalability) almost 10 years in advance I think we should call him The Oracle and not by their chosen pseudonym ;)

My argument is not against the new technology though, it's against using this new technology for something it's not good at, or rather not as good as Bitcoin is. The proven track record of security of Bitcoin and its restrictiveness when it comes to smart-contracts made it possible to avoid the problematic cases we've seen happen in Ehtereum. But it also left plenty of space for Ethereum to create a platform where those risks can be taken, it imply that one will eat the other, there's a large spectrum of risk tolerance and plenty of space for both to co-exist.
The person I was originally answering to just does not seem to understand this and prefers to see only the positive sides of the technology and speculate on future events to try to instill FOMO... It's almost like they have vested interests in the success of Ethereum and do not want to present the facts as they are... for some reason ;)

You do realize that if the amount they can buy gets smaller each time it also means that either their dollar is losing value and/or Bitcoin is gaining value? That should not be a source of frustration past your first purchase ;)
For fees, the best solution currently is to make sure to use Segwit addresses for your transactions... and in the future use Lightning Network potentially.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:14:56
If a **technical feature** of Bitcoin enabled such theft, then yes. To the best of my knowledge this hasn't happened yet (since the beginning of Bitcoin). My point is just that Ethereum is inherently more powerful thanks to turing-completeness and less secure. It makes it really useful for certain applications, but much riskier for others.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:44:42
The fee is set in "satoshis per byte", the effect Segwit has is to reduce the number of total bytes of the actual transaction you send.
So the table will be the same, you will still have to pick a value in sat/byte within the range of wait time you're OK with (it's always an average/estimation of course), but you will pay less than you would have for the same transaction without a Segwit address(es).
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:35:41
Yup, it wasn't a feature request. I know that we can't really know this in real-time for fiat money. It's another advantage of Bitcoin over fiat (as if it needed more), when new coins are created we can track them in real-time ;)

Very unlikely.
They have built a custodial platform where you can buy/sell financial products they offer. If a contract is settled in bitcoins they will credit/debit your account on the platform. You should be free to withdraw them to your Bitcoin wallet whenever you want but those conditions aren't clear yet (their documentation mentions "IP address and withdrawal address whitelisting").
The important part is that for you to be able to withdraw them, they actually need to build a bitcoin reserve (i.e. actually buy/sell bitcoins themselves) which means it will actually have an real impact on Bitcoin's price. Other future products were just virtual transactions based on Bitcoin's valuation (various indexes) that never actually required any party to buy/sell bitcoins as they were settled in fiat currencies anyways.

It actually won't have been a failure and it won't end at that if it's ever the case. Their centralized coin will eventually fail once governments or other authorities will decide to take its control because it isn't censorship resistant and undermines their authority.
People should really stop measuring success just with marketcap and hash power, these variables are nothing compared to the power of a system that cannot be stopped.

This is inaccurate, Coinbase/GDAX do not support Segwit only addresses (bech32, starting with bc1) in their Withdrawal form currently. It reports such addresses as "invalid".
I've tried to ask Coinbase support when bech32 addresses would be supported and couldn't get more than a generic answer related to "Segwit support" from them, telling me they have forwarded my request "to the team" (aka we've moved your message to the Trash folder ;)).
~~Furthermore, the Deposit addresses of Coinbase/GDAX are not Segwit addresses (still start with 1), so you will not benefit from having Segwit addresses if you want to transact with them currently.~~ I was wrong on this, thanks ;)
I still suggest anyone interested in this feature to contact their support asking them to support Segwit addresses and to tell them they will lose your patronage if they do not do their best to decrease fees.
On a side note, they do support P2SH addresses (starting with 3) though, but be wary that with certain wallets, such as Electrum, it is harder to get this kind of addresses, there is a [short guide on how to do it here]( The point about their Deposit address still stands, you won't benefit of this if you only plan to transact with their non-Segwit address.

I'm aware that it has a testnet, if that wasn't obvious I was just taking jab at Bitcoin Cash so-called stress tests on their mainnet. They could not fill block with artificially generated transactions due to a bottleneck in Bitcoin ABC that could have easily been detected on testnet if they cared to test it... yet somehow they *had* to do it on mainnet first... for no apparent reason aside from the wave of dishonest posts about the "increasing activity" of their chain the following few days on reddit/Twitter.

Until they demonstrate that it is working and outperforming their top of the line it is total fiction. Let's apply an *old* principle that should be familiar: don't trust, verify.
It would be wise for the same people who were doubting Halong Mining and their hardware to apply the same caution for Bitmain at times... but it seems that some of them must have an interest in Bitmain's success (Hint: the implications on Bitcoin Cash price maybe ;)) when you see the blind faith they are willing to put in their sweet words.

I completely agree that big players like this should be reactive and implement it rather quickly. To play the devil's advocate, Bitcoin Core does not have a GUI out to generate Segwit addresses either, so it is giving ammo to people who are not in a hurry to implement it unfortunately.
I know it's an open source project and that anyone could develop it if they really want it... now that I think about it, all these conspiracy theories about Blockstream pushing Segwit for their own gains without care about Bitcoin's ecosystem are even more ridiculous, if it was the case they'd be the first ones to dedicate devs to make Segwit adoption even easier from Core's wallet... I guess r_btc gloss over this fact as it doesn't fit their narrative ;)

The DAO hack was possible only because Ethereum is turing-complete, this is a feature of the network. We can discuss as long as you want of how it isn't caused by the network directly, but it just couldn't have happened on Bitcoin's network since it purposefully does not allow such code to run.
For the Parity bug, I'm not aware of the related bug in Bitcoin's multi-sig, would you have more information on that please? Or maybe you were talking about other bugs in Bitcoin Core wallet, if so which ones?

Now it might be, but I've signed up on other exchanges about a year ago and it was usually done within few days. Some even provided instant verification through video conferencing.
I know times have changed due to the influx of new customers, but pretending that everyone should boycott an exchange that works for them currently without mentioning the long wait time it can imply isn't very honest. Yes people should move to exchanges which support Segwit addresses, but unfortunately most people cannot do it seamlessly right now.

Furthermore it's most likely only a temporary state and solutions to remediate this are currently developed and tested.
One of the beauty of Bitcoin is its ability to change, even if it takes time to establish consensus sometimes, it's a consensus of all parties involved unlike fiat currencies which rely on backroom consensus heavily influenced by the people owning most of it.

My understanding is that it is one of Bitcoin's goal is to achieve this though. Once mass adoption will have happened, it will remain a decent store of value since inflation is not going to exist due to the limited supply and people are also going to use it to transact on a daily basis, provided that scaling issues are solved. If you want to elaborate on the reasons why this isn't possible according to you, I'd love to hear more about that.
But I admit we are far from this point, and you are completely right that physical assets such as gold cannot achieve this, that's the reason why Bitcoin is disruptive, it's a new form of asset that can overcome the limitations of what existed before it. If it was just as good as gold, it wouldn't be interesting at all.
Until we achieve these goals we are and we will be in transitional states, it's inevitable, it cannot change overnight. Currently it is seen as both a store of value (with potential applications as a currency for small transactions) by some and as a purely speculative product by others. While the current price increase might be caused by the second group, as long as the underlying projects are alive and we tend to solutions for scaling, Bitcoin isn't going to die. I really think it is the way it has to be for it to grow, just like attack/contentious forks/etc. are also necessary to some extent, to prove that it is resilient. It might lose some or a lot of value if speculators become impatient (and I'm sure everyone will call that a bubble burst), but to me it does not matter, most of the alternatives solutions (altcoins, or even going back to the current corrupt financial system) are still not as viable, so I will be patient and do my best to make Bitcoin a success by spending/accepting it whenever possible and holding it.

I messaged them today and they answered rather quickly (few hours later) with the following, which is most likely a generic answer about SegWit:






















@_date: 2017-12-09 16:00:00
Just a clarification, you have to use a limit order with "Post Only" option checked (by default it is checked, it's hidden in the "Advanced" options).
It's easy to play with those options and forget this detail, if you don't do that you can place limit orders with prices above the current trading price and become a Taker which will cause you to pay fees just as if you placed a simple market order.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:32:31
Looking at your really short posting history you might be a concern troll, but I'll bite anyways.
The "use" can be a store of value use currently and evolve to include a small-transactions use *at the current scale* when it is technologically possible (Segwit, Lightning Network, etc.). Without giving away the premise of decentralization in the long run like BCash will eventually do if their plan is to keep increasing blocksize without restriction.
As for Andreas' position, he has clearly stated that blocksize increase is not a long term solution and that he favors more sustainable and secure solutions (more decentralized).
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:00:09


No need to assume anything, [it's planned](
Obviously they never mention that will cause another debate between a set of people who will finally realize that it isn't a sustainable "scaling" method and the miners, which will end most likely in another contentious hard fork.
But sure it's the way to go guys, we're building a stable currency here, contentious hard fork every few months, nothing to see here, move along. /s

How do you determine your extrapolation factors? You have no way to know how most of the other nodes handle their transactions, the average settings they use, etc.
I don't thee see the point in calculating vague averages based on assumptions, you would only end up with pretty uncertain and most likely inaccurate data.

I honestly welcome this kind of tests for Bitcoin. The interesting part is how this will unfold on this scale (Bulgaria is a rather small market). If banks can get away with locking people's assets without a valid reason **indefinitely**, then they might very well completely lose trust from their customers who will look for better ways to store their assets in the future...
I wonder how they could do that �� Surely not by using actual cash to buy magic internet money directly, without banks being able to do anything about it ;)

But if people want to share their experiences with other exchanges on this market I'd love to hear them.

Roger Ver proved multiple times that he does not want to engage in a debate, he is only using appeal to pity (dying babies), fallacious comparisons, and loaded questions. Engaging with dishonest people for discussion is useless and when they are proven to be dishonest in their business practices (advertising Bitcoin Cash as as Bitcoin, lying about actual fees by only using maximum figures) you should just completely ignore them... unless you fancy getting scammed.

How are we supposed to explore and get people interested in cryptocurrencies if we're not allowed to talk/write about them in fear of inciting few fools who will on their own initiative risk their money in them?
I do not think I have ever heard AA recommend to anyone to buy BTC or ETH explicitly, he presents arguments in favor/against each technology, he answers about altcoins when prompted about them and if he knows them... He's really not into giving investment advices publicly as far as I can tell. I have watched/listened to a lot of his content, but if you have links to content proving otherwise, feel free to send them my way. 
So based on this premise, what exactly do you expect from him? A 100% dedication to the Bitcoin maximalist cause? How is it more productive than allowing himself to be open to other technologies and maybe see if they can apply to Bitcoin or who knows maybe replace it (I'm not talking about ETH here, I'm just giving an hypothetical). If the mere idea that something better than Bitcoin can invented is a forbidden thought, you're more into a religion than into a cryptocurrency.

This word really irks me when it is used with Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not need legitimacy, it is sound money by design and the consensus rules enforced on its network concretize it in a decentralized manner.
Banks, governments and other financial institutions need legitimacy, because they need people to trust them for them to be able to function. Stop trying to apply these old concepts to a disruptive and trustless system like Bitcoin. You might think that an easy way to make people adopt Bitcoin is for it to bend/blend itself so it fits in people's old ways, but the whole point is to make people stop using their old ways which have been proven to fail on a global scale and only reinforce their captivity (i.e. financial crises, money devaluation through endless inflation, unchecked debt generation, lack of transparency, etc.). Bitcoin is meant to free people from having to trust the same people who are abusing their trust over and over again.
I can agree with you that those financial solutions will give more publicity and exposure to Bitcoin, that it might benefit the price, but people should really keep focus on the end goals of Bitcoin. 
Nobody likes a salesman who puts their foot in the doorway, be honest with what you are selling and if people are not interested because they are fine being captive of a financial system you will not change their mind by tricking them into the system using promises of ROI. You will only temporarily affect the price this way, until they notice it. And if you actually make them lose money doing this it is most likely the best way to ensure they will forever consider it as a scam, which would ruin the even smallest chance of them understanding the actual goals of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:21:55
That or "store of value" while we fix the issues that make it impractical for every day use and still maintain it decentralized/secure. If people see potential in a technology and figure that even with its imperfections it is still better than other banking solutions, why is it a problem?

I feel like you might be trolling a bit here, but anyways, the difficulty is adjusted algorithmically following consensus rules on Bitcoin's network. All the Bitcoin nodes agree with this DAA (Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm) and the difficulty is automatically adjusted every 2016 blocks (A block every ~10 minutes -&gt; (2016*10)/60/24/7 = ~2 weeks between adjustments) based on the work proven by miners within the last period to ensure that there is roughly 10 minutes between each mined block.

How do you establish that this is what "most users" do? In my experience most wallets now automatically manage your receive and change addresses and to reuse the same address you have to save the address outside of the wallet (in text or QR tag form) manually...

If you have some time for reading you can [dip into the write up of one of the LN dev team's]( on their goals on that matter and what's already working.
It is true that routing is challenging when demand for Lightning transactions increases, the network has to grow at an healthy pace and with a balanced number of *routing nodes*. But the problem with the argument I quoted above is that when someone requires routing to be "perfect" at all the time, that each node should know every possible route and know the cheapest/shortest route on the first try/instantly, they are setting unrealistic expectations (appeal to purity) that they can easily abuse to convince uninformed people that LN is non-functional. The actual goal of LN is to find an affordable and working route, it might not be the cheapest one that exists at a precise point in time, it can take few seconds/automated retries to go through, and all these issues can be/are being worked on.

It might open your eyes on how early it is for this tech's acceptance, a lot of people have no idea about the goals and positive things Bitcoin can bring to this world, they concentrate on what they perceive as negative traits: power consumption, temporary disruption in computer hardware suppliers (mainly GPU's) and their misunderstandings of the technology.

You are right, it is called survior bias and it is prevalent in the technology related space. We have a rather positive attitude towards "failure" though, because ideas which have traction at the start fail in favor of improved versions, the failed technologies are either the base of the successful ones or the learning step necessary to be successful. It does not mean that people will not lose money at some point,  it is an unfortunate side effect of the innovation process.

I think it just shows what many of us knew all along, trusting someone else with your money has consequences. This includes all the centralized exchanges. There is no stepping up for them, they are doing what they want to do by becoming a middlemen, they do it because they are rent-seeking. The only way to "step up" is actually to move away from centralized systems.
It really seems like some users do not understand that they are supposed to be in charge of their money, if they do not intend to be in charge then they are much better off using currently established centralized banking solutions. These have centuries of practice and while far from perfect they work most of the time with much less risk (brought by regulations that work because they are centralized). You just need to be "worth" something for those trusted entities to have access to them... which is also something that Bitcoin solves by being available to anyone.

You are repeating your initial mistake about those grievances when you call them "minor". Bitcoin.org is a community driven website, it has built its reputation on this, so when you unilaterally published changes against the opinion of many of its contributors you've disrespected them and their work... that's everything but "minor". They are (almost all) volunteers, they give their free time to help Bitcoin and with your actions you show them that this represents nothing since you control the DNS and you get to dictate where the website will be going ultimately.
The fact that you've decided (unilaterally again) to not renew the partnership is of little significance, I would say that it is a good thing and would show that you might have understood your mistake... but the breach of trust happened and was never settled, you have never addressed how this would not happen again in your community. I'm not talking about "no sponsorship ever again", I'm talking about a transparent process to make sure enough contributors agree with the specific terms of such deal before it's actually signed.


If this were to happen it would be caused by the reaction of the community to your actions, this means that it's not us who created this situation, we are only reacting to it... the reaction might be sub-optimal for "Bitcoin" in general but as you are the one in control of the website, you have the keys to make things *rights*. Blaming the people who react to your actions doesn't make much sense when it was rather predictable what would happen.
My take would be to own up to the mistakes in the handling this "sponsorship", establish a clear way to not reproduce them, make sure to be active/collaborative in the [recent PR about the domain ownership]( and acknowledge that the concerns of the community are not all meant to strip you from your control but to share it among major contributors to make sure the efforts of this community can't easily slip away from it due to unforeseen events.
Obviously that is just my opinion on how to deal with the situation, I don't mean to tell your what to do, you're the legitimate owner of this website and as I said you are virtually the only one able to take those decisions.

I mean if they do have an incentive to do it, they won't wait for you to explain it here and it needs to be fixed somehow... hoping they won't find out isn't really a secure way to go about it. I see two possiblities:
1. They are not motivated by profit, their intent is to destroy Bitcoin at any cost. Controlling 51% of the hashpower is very costly on such a large network and sustaining this attack for a long time is even more expensive. It will always be time to react to such a massive attack, maybe at the cost of an emergency hardfork (and obviously a massive price dip), but aside from slowing down Bitcoin it would not destroy it as far as I know.
2. They are motivated by profit, and I really do not see what their incentives are since they would be collecting the same rewards by not double spending and they would preserve the value of this money at the same time.
Honestly I don't see how any of this is a new problem, past the infancy of Bitcoin this situation has always been this way... those pretty much always existed... so I'd love it if you could elaborate on what changed and how you think it should be fixed.

**Beware:** If you have used the wallet "Electrum **Pro**" to generate private keys and use them to store Bitcoin you should move these funds to new private keys as soon as possible.
You should obviously generate them with a wallet that is not trying to steal them ;) For example the official Electrum wallet, which can be downloaded from  (and always verify the signature of the file that you have downloaded before installing the software).

I guess morally you already know the answer, keeping money that was paid to you by mistake is not honest. But obviously you could ignore your moral compass and keep it, which leads us to your actual question.


The question you are asking is rather "can I get in trouble legally for keeping it" and it depends on many factors:
1. Will the people affected by the mistake ever discover it? (chances are yes...)
2. Will they be able to identify you? (depends your relation with this exchange, if they have your personal information, if you used anonymous services to access to their plarform, etc.).
3. Will they have access to a jurisdiction that will be able to force you to return the money? (depends on the laws of the country/countries involved, their financial ability to sue you, etc.)
In terms of law I would guess that it falls under the "[unjust enrichment]( category and obviously the way it is handled depends of the jurisdiction. But if the 3 points I've listed above are not in your favor, I would not give you a high chance of keeping this money in the end if it ever gets in the hands of a judge, you might even get charged interest, damages and a fine (considering the sum, certain jurisdictions might even consider it a penal offense).
My advice would be to be honest and contact the exchange about it to see how the issue could be settled, but that is just how I would handle it. I'm not a lawyer and this is just an advice from a stranger on Internet.

Seeing how stale those issues end up on bitcoin . org's GitHub, especially on the owners' end, I suppose this is a good logical first step to be prepared if bitcoin . org ever becomes stale, rogue or dies because nobody planned the case of their owners being unable/unwilling to continue the good things they have done for Bitcoin.
I must say I'm not a big fan of having the commonly used market tricker (BTC) in the URL though, if we are going to talk about Bitcoin it would be better to have the name in the URL. I've checked and few other variations with "bitcoin" in the domain name would still be available... so it's a rather weird first choice, but it's not definitive ;)

You've summed up your problem in this single paragraph, both the company and you have accepted to trust a third party with your transaction. It could have been avoided if the merchant actually accepted Bitcoin directly.
Adoption is seriously hindered by this because it's a complete shift in paradigm for all parties involved and requires more effort from merchants, but their incentive is that they do not have to deal with chargebacks and have access to the funds really quickly compared to other payment solutions.


I do not really see a way to solve your issue in this case, you should ask to see a manager and make clear that the system they have offered for payment clearly has a flaw and that if you are going to suffer losses from it you will certainly not do business with them anymore and discourage other potential customers (leaving them bad reviews, etc.).

I guess you'll have to give more details about who supposedly is a "BTC leader" and how they defamed Satoshi.
I'm pretty sure that there is no such thing as a "BTC leader" and that Bitcoin's consensus protocol was put at work to decide all of this. That's how it was conceived by Satoshi and participants are given the choice by being able to run the software they want (as a matter of fact they can still run older versions if they do not agree with Segwit for example).
Furthermore, I don't think a handful of Ukrainians trying to build a statue qualifies as "we". If they'd enjoy a statue, good for them, it's not relevant to Bitcoin and how it works.

1. Send your first transaction with a low fee with the output being a merchant that will deliver goods/services on 0-conf basis.
2. Issue a second transaction to your own output(s) using the inputs from the first transaction, with a higher fee, to a part of the network that is not aware of the first transaction yet (or that is known to always favor higher fees transactions... it's part of the consensus that miners can make such choice without consequences or rather nothing prevents them from doing so). You could be in control of this part of the network too to make it even easier.
3. If this second transaction gets mined before the first one, the first one will never get mined by other miners as this would render their block invalid and rejected by other nodes that included a transaction spending the same inputs previously.
RBF, on Bitcoin's chain, makes this kind of activity easier to pull off but it is clearly displayed on the transaction itself and it has pretty much always been admitted that nobody should rely on 0-conf, with any kind of transaction (RBF or not). The recent push for 0-conf is only appearing because Bitcoin Cash has no counterpoint to Lightning Network "instantaneous" transactions otherwise, as I said, it is only a marketing "feature".
I am in no way claiming that this can be pulled of by any user very easily, it is just not an unimaginable scenario and it is not just purely theoretical:

Why would they burden themselves with a blockchain data structure when they can achieve transactions faster currently with their current centralized payment systems?
They don't really care about censorship resistance (they are the ones doing the censorship currently, denying people access to their services for arbitrary reasons), so why would they need to decentralize this aspect of their business?
Honestly if they do this now or within the next few years I don't really know what would be their incentives aside from riding the marketing wave of "muh' blockchain".

@_date: 2018-05-29 12:13:50
I'm not sure how it changes the problem concerning your own responsibility. I suppose the exchange might notice even faster if the issue is of a larger scale (i.e. they might audit their recent transactions if suddenly multiple people report problems)... but in the end you are still responsible of not accepting money you know for a fact was not meant to be paid to you.
The fact that Bitcoin isn't as regulated as the banking industry might make you think that the law is different, but honestly in front of a judge if they can prove that you enriched yourself in an "unjust" manner (varies from jurisdiction), you would certainly have trouble explaining how you figured that it was "just"... as a matter of fact you already said it yourself, you feel like you've stolen this money ;)

Not really hard to be better than 0-conf, it's a marketing feature that only exists in practice under specific conditions that the network cannot guarantee to exist at any time.

Custodial solutions are not some kind of *evil* that we should fight at all cost. They have a place for the people who are not ready to manage private keys or don't feel comfortable to do it for various reasons (competence, security, etc.). As long as those solutions do not lock their users in and they still allow them to switch to trustless/non-custodial alternatives, they are useful to Bitcoin in my book.
A complete switch to Bitcoin for everyone is utopic, but imagining that the road to it would consist of only 100% non-custodial solutions is impractical.
I'm not sure under which category Fidelity's custodial solution is going to fall, anyone has more details on the ways out of their platform?

You are a speculator. If "use" was your concern you would just buy it when it is actually useful to you. You want this investment to be worth more and finally be useful at some point through the failure of competitors (or their inability to start). This is the definiton of a zero sum game, which other evidence do you need? There is not much else to debate in this case, your two other points are also linked to your perception of success for Bitcoin.
That is exactly what he describes in the video, with an absolutist/maximalist perspective like yours and a restricted definition of what success is I can understand your point of view... I just don't share it.
Lastly if an attack on Bitcoin with hashrate was to be successful it wouldn't be the attackers' fault, just a demonstration that the security model is not adapted to the actual threats we face. For now it does not seem to be the case, 10 years and counting.

I know it's about verifying your own transactions first and foremost and preserve your sovereignty over your money by choosing the right chain.
I mean sure you can run those nodes using Utreexo but if you just keep those proofs then it's not really a full node, people who are new on Bitcoin network won't be able to rely on you for your initial sync? Or maybe I've missed the point.
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:15:49


Being sure that your transactions are happening on the chain you've chosen to follow (by choosing the software to verify this) should be a good economic incentive, it insures your economic freedom. It also keeps miners in check as they will want to mine the chain where most economic activity is happening (fees).


Many coins have tried "ASIC resistance", as soon as they become somewhat profitable it forces switching because ASIC are developed just for them (Siacoin for example). It's an eternal game of cat and mouse, you frustrate people who invested to mine your chain, it's not viable. If you have better proven ideas just point at a successful altcoin and their novel mining system... I'll just wait here.


If it's not through mining, are you talking about rent seeking for just using the network and not providing any actual **work**?

While I understand the sentiment expressed here, have you ever wondered where Bitcoin would be currently without SPV clients?
Decentralization is a spectrum, trustlessness too. SPV has always been about diluting the trust you put in the full nodes you connect to, I don't think it was ever sold as a replacement to running full nodes. Aside maybe on chains like BCH, where ultimately you are not going to be able to run your own nodes even if you wanted to because it is going to get too expensive for most users (and unavailable in most part of the World just in terms of bandwidth).
If you want complete sovereignty over your money and/or run applications that require it you will run a full node and Bitcoin developers' role is to ensure that this is available/possible for most users around the World. If you are not able (competence, financial means, location, etc.) or do not want to run a full node but you still want/need to use Bitcoin then SPV and Neutrino are viable alternatives. This is why they are needed in this space. As long as they remain alternatives and not a forced standard because it's too expensive/cumbersome to run full nodes, I don't see a problem with this.
Providing those alternatives is not giving up on the ideals we thrive for, it's acknowledging that not everything is black or white. It also increases the accessibility of Bitcoin and might convince users to invest in running their own full node at some point.

Do you keep logs of the phone numbers/addresses used for each transaction?
I mean I ask this but I know you are doing it or you are going to be forced to do it by authorities at some point... and you might even be forced to limit access to the service by the same people.
I'm not trying to discard your efforts, I think this kind of application can find its user base and uses, but it must be clear to everyone that in terms of privacy and censorship resistance this is a downgrade compared to usual Bitcoin transactions (I've understood that the underlying transaction is a Bitcoin transaction, the initial exchange and storage of information about the transaction on your servers is the issue).

Sorry for your loss.
Maybe he had an hardware wallet, it looks like a small USB key/device: [Trezor]( [Ledger]( [KeepKey]( are among the most popular ones.
Theses require a PIN/password before you can access the funds. The existence of such device is usually also going to imply he had a paper with a list of words (his seed) which could be used to access the funds without such PIN/password.
If he didn't have such hardware device or a seed, chances are his wallets are either on his computer or smartphone. There are many applications that can do this, you've mentioned Coinbase which is a custodial exchange, but there are also mobile wallets (Electrum, Samourai Wallet, Wasabi Wallet, Mycelium, etc.).
Finally he might also have left his funds on a custodial exchange (like Coinbase) without using their app, in which case you'll have to find which one, hope you have the credentials to access his account or contact the support to try to resolve the issue and get access to his funds (it would most likely involve proving them that he passed away and that you are his legal heir). Maybe your father was using a password manager of some sort (like Keepass or LastPass) and was storing this kind of information in there.
Hopefully those possibilities will help you, good luck in your searches.

This isn't a good state of mind in my opinion. Let them fail if they have to, but believing that they have to fail for you to succeed is not productive. This is an open source environment, if they find something that works just use it for your own project, that's how you make Bitcoin stronger. Open source and forking makes it possible and desirable.
I don't think any of the current fork approaches are able to preserve the features of Bitcoin I care for the most: decentralization and censorship resistance. But I don't **need** them to fail, their failure has no use to me, we aren't in a zero sum game. The occasions I spend time into arguing with forks proponents is when they use deception and lies to attack Bitcoin, the same mentality I described as counterproductive (i.e. they resort to attacking instead of building because they need Bitcoin to fail, hoping that it might make them relevant).
This is pretty well explained by Andreas Antonopoulos [in his last video]( actually, I've always had this approach and he formulated quite well as usual.

That might be your metric for success,  mine is more focused on preserving the aspects of Bitcoin that make it different from fiat money. This includes among other things privacy and censorship resistance.
But again this wasn't meant as an attack on your service, thanks for the additional information... my point was rather to outline the disadvantages I've perceived in transacting this way.

That's not "intrinsic", that would be "extrinsic" meaning that the value is defined/dictated from outside (by the state).
The paper, ink and metals used to make cash are what would give intrinsic value to it and clearly the goal is for those to be as cheap as possible while still being hard to counterfeit. When it's not true you see people destroying cash to resell its components (i.e. melting coins to resell the precious metal).

Agreed. Security through obscurity doesn't work though, this is why I advocate for a switch to an open source and free software instead of continuing to use proprietary software and formats like RAR and ACE.
It isn't a cure for bugs and security holes, this is why I also recommended to change the behavior of opening anything carelessly, recommended to use better ways to secure your private keys (like an hardware wallet) and keep them updated.
[7-Zip does not support ACE]( so no it should not be affected by this security issue... and I admit it isn't an appropriate replacement for compression/decompression if you require to use ACE. In this case what's recommended by OP is the best course of action.

You do realize that technically Bitcoin is still in beta, it still hasn't had it's first 1.0 release, we're at 0.18.1 ;)


If you're going to do only one LN transaction and close the channel it makes little sense, you're right (unless the merchant only accepts LN payments).
The point is rather to fill your LN wallet with some money you intend to spend, open few channels (might be automatic depending on your LN wallet) and then being able to spend on LN whenever you want with minimal to no additional fees with in as many transaction you want.
Hybrid Bitcoin/LN wallets like Electrum are coming, so if having two apps is your worry you should have a solution in a near future.

Gitlab isn't perfect either, they also have to be kept in check. Just recently they have tried to integrate mandatory first and third-party telemetry in their products (even paid ones) and thanks to the user backlash those measures were reversed for now.
But all of those products are provided by businesses, they have to monetize products and make profits. A free plan is costly for such business so they will always try to please big markets which use their paid plans even if it means making compromises about your privacy or even your freedom of expression.

It may, there's still no correlation to causation link here. He could have used a weak password in such circumstances too. But Todd just uses this speculation to rationalize his belief that the death was not faked when it is not how you can logically determine this (investigators should determine this: verify the death certificate and how it was established, identify the body, etc.).
This is why I say it is post hoc rationalization, he started from his premise that the death was not faked and tried to find something to justify his theory. Adding "if" before such conclusion doesn't exempt you from using logic to reach it.

I think we can agree that the answer is: it's **directly** backed by nothing.
Indirectly though, without this threat of violence the USD wouldn't be nearly as dominant as it is and the USA wouldn't have as much valuable resources and power. The American people still levy this by having access to cheap oil, cheap natural gas, their government has a lot of power over foreign governments, etc. It's just coming back in the form of indirect benefits from this "investment" in violence, and they do choose this investment by voting for politicians who keep financing the tools used to practice this violence internationally (i.e. the most powerful armed forces).
Just to be clear this isn't US bashing, each democratic country that isn't neutral does this to their best ability. The US are just the best at it and have the most power because of it. It allows them to generally dictate a big part of the currency politics in the World.

Because pretty much all the projects branded with "blockchain included" are missing one or most of the propetries of Bitcoin: open/public, borderless, trustless, decentralized/censorship-resistant and neutral. And generally they are sold with this "blockchain" branding just because they want to surf on Bitcoin's name without even requiring the constraints of a blockchain structure, their projects will be centralized anyways so they would profit much more of a general purpose database.

Most of the time they would tax you for this donation to a stranger (in many jurisications there is a limit for tax *free* donations to family members, per year, sometimes per decade, etc. often it doesn't exempt your from declaration anyways).
So they'd even ask you for more taxes ironically if that's the justification you gave.
The boat accident is a better excuse in this regard, but still not perfect... if they have absolutely no way to link some addresses to your identity you should just deny the property of them at any point in time. Inventing stories where you had them at some point is just an admission that a taxable event happened in many jurisdictions.

Average transaction value in USD is not a very meaningful metric, a single multi-million USD worth transaction will skew it a lot and the cost of making one isn't that big provided you have theses funds (and they happen almost organically when exchanges move funds around).
Median is more meaningful, [it's ~$200-300 and it has been around this for some time now](
On the datasource of OP the median is ~$40 for some reason, no idea what's the difference between our datasources.

You'd be in the red, but it's somewhat obvious when you choose the ATH, by definition there has not been a higher value since then.
On the other hand if you has invested in a smarter way for this type of asset, you'd have used a Dollar Cost Average plan and even from that ATH value it gives this:


You'll find examples in which DCA has a negative ROI of course. We can agree that any example will be arbitrary, the question is rather was it realistic to expect people to have made this purchase back then and held on to it. It really depends on the reasons why they have purchased Bitcoin in the first place.
In the context of people buying Gold (as in the OP) it seems like a rather long term investment/value storage. Bitcoin seems to perform well in the long term too but with a lot more volatility along the way so you can't buy/sell in bulk without taking more risks.

Lightning Network relies on transaction maleability to be fixed on chain. Litecoin fixed this by implementing and deploying Segwit (even before Bitcoin). 
Bitcoin Cash has no intention to fix this bug, none of their node implementationns have this fix on their roadmap and if you dare spending some time in their communities and try to suggest fixing it they usually get mad because scalling "must happen on-chain", "LN is a conspiracy by Blockstream", "you are a LN shill", "LN coins create inflation", etc... None of which are true and for the last one isn't even grounded in reality as there is no such thing as "LN coins". Each Bitcoin or Litecoin used on LN is backed by a Hashed Time Lock Contract on their respective blockchain which can be reliably traced back to their creator thanks to the transaction malleability fix.
The fact that they have this approach when it comes to fixing a known bug is a great demonstration of their approach of a "permissionless" system and it is bad, they decided what is allowed... they won't fix a bug that can allow them or other developers to use their chain for non destructive applications... And it is not due a lack of opportunities, they hardforked 2 times and will hardfork again soon... still no fix for a known bug that hinders innovation and has multiple existing solutions (Segwit  being one that has implementations that have been used in prodution for more than a year now).

I'm all for incentive based solutions... but why aren't the incentives of collecting fees and the block reward sufficient now?
Why do miners need new discounts now to participate (and help it by actually helping transactions to happen) in a network that gives actual value to the coin they have chosen to mine?
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:36:35
Great choice!
I hope you understand that as easy as GoUrl was, they were the ones who had ownership and sovereignty of the Bitcoin funds you would have received through them. They would also have asked you a 1.5% fee to process every transactions and just *promised* you to forward payments "automatically" (every 3 payments you'd receive they'd send you one batch if I understood their system correctly). They are also subject to laws that might force them to deny you access to their service... which means you'd be unable to accept transaction until you'd find a replacement.
With BTCPay Server as soon as you receive a payment and after it gets confirmed few times on the network you own and control these funds, no third party can seize them without you revealing them the related private keys, no other fees involved aside from the ones your customer will pay to Bitcoin miners when they send money.
Also by choosing BTCPay Server you are in a good position to accept Lightning Network transactions too if you ever decide to. Those have the benefits of being instant, trustless and with minimal fees (currently few satoshis at most).

I can agree with this, though I'd be iffy with the cloud part... that's one more third-party in the way to your access to Bitcoin, your ISP is already a strong contender for the most easily censorable link.
I still think that there will always be enough economically active nodes online (other than mining nodes) to preserve an acceptable level of decentralization without introducing financial incentives, even if SPV and light clients are used more and more. As long as it is affordable to run nodes (i.e. we don't raise requirement too quickly... or at all) there will be applications and users which are going to need and want to run them for the incentive I've mentioned before (their economical sovereignty/freedom). I doubt that this ideal we are pushing for Bitcoin will just vanish because there are light alternatives, with less requirements... on the contrary this first easier entry might convince some users to want an actual full node.
Considering the relatively long existence of SPV and the growth in full nodes on the network I think it's not just my belief... I doubt Bitcoin would be where it is currently without SPV, but I guess only time will tell. I'm not sure Luke's attitude to fight those alternatives makes sense in this regard.

I'm in cypto because it allows me to do what I want with my money without having someone like you telling me what I can or cannot do. But I know which part you don't understand: permissionlessness. There is no force involved here and you don't get to decide what Bitcoin participants can or cannot build upon it. Sidechains or system making trade-offs are welcome by default on Bitcoin, you are trying to pretend that this should not happen when it's an intrinsic feature of Bitcoin. So you "fuck off" as you're the one trying to imply that Bitcoin should change to avoid this kind of services. I on the other hand want them to be built and let the market decide if they are useful or not.


Good, Bitcoin does this and a sidechain cannot prevent it from happening. If your crazy doomsday theories were to become a reality I would still be in control of my keys and I would still have an exit.


I don't care about their interests, they cannot force me to do anything I don't want to with my money with the code currently running to form Bitcoin's network and it's certainly not a sidechain that will change this fact.
@_date: 2018-10-17 13:50:46


If I could put more emphasis on one of the suggestions FieserKiller has made here it would be this one. The common user will not really be interested in the "sat/byte" value, but rather by the actual total fee incurred by the transaction they are creating. So putting this number in the foreground should be a priority, displaying the "sat/byte" is a nice bonus if you manage to keep it without cluttering the UI (considering the other things suggested by others it might become an issue). Thinking about what the users will ask himself when creating their first transaction should give you the key things to display, the options he would need for his following transactions could easily be moved into an "Advanced" pane.

1. Scammer sets up an online wallet for the victim, backups the BIP39 seed for themselves and ask the victim to change the password of the wallet when they communicate the login info.
2. Unexperienced victim changes the password, **mistakenly** assuming that now they are the only one able to access the wallets.
3. Scammer incites the victim to make more and more deposits on the wallet by promising more ROI (return on investment) and at some point they steal everything using the BIP39 seed.

As far as I know there is no such thing as "destroying" bitcoins (that would be quite damaging) and eventually the cryptography used to protect some of these "lost" funds will become obsolete in the face of the computing power that will be available in the future.

Segwit transactions count for less weight than non-Segwit, he could fit more of them within the block weight limit and thus earn more fees with the same block.

I agree, but I'm of the opinion that it's none of our businesses which transactions his mining operation chooses as long as he complies with the network consensus rules. He can run his business in an badly optimized way if he wants to... who are we really to tell him how to do it?
When he mine a block he earns the right to make these choices, he provides work (time, money and resources) for it. Plus I have no idea how we could force them to make "better" choices, if we could be sure which transactions should be in a block, we wouldn't be asking miners to determine this... it's the whole point of the PoW mechanism after all.
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:06:55
Oh yeah, I should have mentioned that it's certainly not a completely unanimous will of them to not fix it and that there has been work done by talented people in order to fix it (some of this work was even initially planned for Bitcoin but required hard forking and was not seen as a good solution for Bitcoin currently). 
I was mainly trying to point out that it really seems to be a very low (and maybe "won't fix") priority bug for most of their developers and users (miners included) although if it prevent any form of innovation that has to rely on transaction id's to function.
Anecdotally, as a developer myself (not in blockchain related tech, mind you) the thought of being aware of a bug in my software with existing solutions and not implementing any of them is a rather frustrating idea... so I doubt it isn't a conscious choice from developers at least ;)
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:54:18
No it is "Don't trust, verify" on purpose, Bitcoin allows you this when no other system does... and that is the whole point of it.

Have you figured out a way to own anything in your name that the state won't notice (typically for houses deeds are not optional) ... they will come after you sooner or later. Cryptocurrencies won't make their outreach shorter and they will keep using coercive means to make you pay taxes on what they estimate you owe them. They only ask you to declare it in the first place to make everyone's life "easier" but if you don't cooperate they have no issue taking what they deem theirs.

There is, until Bitcoin has scaled up sufficiently to accommodate all kinds of transactions on a global scale while staying decentralized. You don't get to dictate this.
New data can lead to different results for the same question over time, just because block size increase through a hard fork or to the arbitrary value you wanted was rejected by the majority of Bitcoin's users last year does not mean it won't be different in the future.

You were trusting Samourai to retrieve a correct fiat rate too, if you want to pull out the "trustless" card ;)
I agree that they have made it more inconvenient to deal with certain transaction scenarios (i.e. you have to check the fiat value yourself if you are unsure), they justified it and it's really up to users to decide if they need to see fiat **in** their Bitcoin wallet. If so, they should try a wallet for less experienced users... there's a place for every kind of wallet anyways.

Storing value out of the reach of governmental entities is a use case. I don't think OP intended to say everyone was buying goods and services directly with Bitcoin.
You can always hope for banks and/or the government to fix the situation to restore your access to your funds when failures like these happen, but as a matter of fact with Bitcoin you know your funds will be safe and available as soon as you get access to a Bitcoin node (directly or indirectly).

Your closing statement seems to contradict the rest of the points you're making by implying that trust is a binary decision, when in reality it's a spectrum. For various kinds of transactions and circumstances the required level of trust between parties varies. In a federated environments like Liquid the exchanges have a reasonable (and legal) background that allow them to be more trustful of their counter-parties. In the context of LN the risk-reward of trying to abuse a peer is really low due to the nature of the micro-transactions and penalties at stake, etc...
Nobody is going to design a system which makes trade-offs from on-chain transactions without any benefit (low fees, instant transfers, etc.) it just doesn't make any economical sense. And as long as users (i.e. anyone able to create an address on Bitcoin) have the ability to transact on-chain and run a node to verify it themselves, for me "Don't trust, verify" still applies... whether nobody (99% according to your unsourced statistic) chooses to do is irrelevant, what matter is the ability of doing it with reasonable means.

It's not, it's a data structure. How Bitcoin uses it is the relevant part (through PoW and Nakamoto consensus) and software developers who include a blockchain in their products just to pretend that they are comparable to Bitcoin work under the "blockchain, not Bitcoin" delusion.


You've asked for clarification on the "blockchain, not Bitcoin" idea and why it is a delusion, that's what I've answered to. Remove the word "included" if your mind cannot handle the additional context, the sentence keeps its meaning.


Why would I? That's not how people using "blockchain, not Bitcoin" attempt to sell their software solutions.

Not sure which wallet you are using from this screenshot, but according to blockchain explorers the BCH funds are at the address you've mentioned.
If you control the private keys of this address on BTC, you also control the same address on BCH. But your wallet most likely use different keys for each wallet (which would explain why it doesn't show it in your BCH wallet).
To access your funds, you need to find and extract the private key of the address (18QKVHy1CKvoBJriZjq9tUEUtW8SH8iL9q) and add it to your BCH wallet (if this feature exists) or do it any wallet that allows adding private keys manually.
And be sure to not reveal this private key to anyone as it would give them full control of the funds on this address.

They do the work, they get to *choose* their users in a way. If you don't agree, there are many alternatives, that's just want I wanted to point out.
Actually when they are going to release their backend server software (I think by the end of the year) you'll be able to fork it and make it better yourself, there's no need to have such an absolutist perspective on this in my opinion, they do not control all the wallets software, plenty of others offer the feature you seem to crave for.

It's awesome when authors actually make the distinction between the processor and the merchant.
When you have a bad experience like this (BitPay is pretty consistent at giving you a bad experience), be sure to report it to the merchant mentioning the payment processor as the issue. They are usually interested in this kind of feedback and you could even suggest them a solution like BTCPay Server which is open source, easy and cheap to setup so they can actually stop relying on third-parties.

I don't regret it, when I used "oh well" I was just appreciating that if I want to use Bitcoin as a payment method currently I have to accept dealing with its value volatility and if it isn't in my favor in the past it means the project is growing which ultimately is my goal.

Users (miners, businesses and customers) are in control, not software developers. Bitcoin Core can be forked and used at will. It doesn't happen because the software users agree with the current consensus rules. All the minority forks from last year stayed minority and either disappeared or are slowly dying out.
Theses consensus rules make Bitcoin permissionless and allow any business to build upon it and create a sidechain like Liquid. I'm not a fan of such services as they don't directly get any advantage for the kind of transactions I make with Bitcoin but I can figure that certain businesses can have a use for them. Pretending that they have no place in this space is especially close-minded and not compatible with Bitcoin's principles.

    Please take a guess and write the amount in above that you think Bitcoin will be worth on 15 August 2019. Any guess is allowed, even zero. Then have a look at this flyer again in a year to see how close your guess was to the actual price on the day.
    If you truly are interested to learn about the technology behind Bitcoin, you will have to take responsibility for your own education.
    
    DO NOT respond to advertisements about Bitcoin on Facebook or spam emails or Internet popup adverts. There is a high likelihood that those are just scams.
    
    DO NOT trust mainstream media and the banks to tell you the truth about Bitcoin. They have their own agenda and do not have your best interests at heart.
    
    DO your own research. Go onto YouTube and lookup videos by brilliant people like Andreas Antonopoulos, Salfedean Ammous and the World Crypto Network. If someone in your family or circle of friends knows a lot about Bitcoin it might be wise to talk to them because they will likely give you their honest advice without expecting anything in return.
    
    BE VERY CAREFUL of people that try to convince you that some other crypto is better than Bitcoin. There is a lot of want to be coins but there is only one true Bitcoin, BTC.
    
    NEVER put any money into cryptocurrency that you cannot afford to, and are not willing to lose.

I wouldn't be so categoric. Firstly we are talking about hypothetical scenarios but they are quite likely as long as we continue making progress in computing. Secondly Bitcoin would become worthless only if nobody was willing to make it change in the face of such events.
Users have a responsibility to take care of their funds in Bitcoin, manage their wallets, audit their security, etc. Developers are part of this and will adapt their software to make it possible for users to take care of their funds appropriately (for example transfer them to addresses which cannot be cracked in their updated software). The people who aren't willing to adapt might lose funds and it is part of the risks of being in control of your own money... it doesn't have only benefits, especially if you are careless.
I'm not denying that this can have an impact on the value of Bitcoin, but it's inherent of this system, it's not a hidden fact and people can factor it in when they decide to use Bitcoin and give it value.
If you compare it to fiat, people are much more careless and figure that the people in charge of it have their best interest in mind although they have proven time and time again that it isn't the case... many people got ruined because of it, and they couldn't do anything about it even if they wanted. With Bitcoin on the other hand, if the system shows signs of failure they are in full capacity to upgrade or exit it (this include forking and splitting the chain with rules that revert changes/transactions that a majority of users did not agree with... in order to preserve the value of their money).

Who said it was? 


 
Stop assuming my intentions. I pointed out that OP's comparison of nodes count did not have much merit and that there are way better arguments in favor of LN than using this false equivalences. I'm not trying to make anything sound bad about LN.


We agree on this (I've pointed it out in my previous answer). A comparison of users would include all the clients people use ("public and private LN nodes" vs. "SPV and Full Bitcoin Cash nodes", it can't realistically be done (and it is a good thing in terms of privacy), but this does not mean you have to fallback on counting the nodes to which users are connecting to, it's a meaningless metric.


Since you don't seem to be willing to correct your own misinformation about what is a LN node, you will surely be able to tell me which software you run as a LN wallet that is not a LN node implementation?

The fees also act as a *spam* deterrent, the current lower limit makes sure the transactions are at least somewhat financially motivated and not just an attack. They can still be an attack (there is no way around this which would not introduce potential censorship vectors), but at least it comes with a price for the attacker which implies that such an attack cannot be indefinitely sustained.
Other approaches based on tx age as you mention are risky in a time of congestion, a slower propagation of transactions might make it much easier to double spend in certain cases... and without any fees they would still be much more exposed to spamming.

Watching over this and switching to the most profitable pool should be a priority for every miner for sure. And the pools' logical priority should be to maximize profits for theirs users so they don't switch.
So it's good to talk about it, but in my opinion it's not a bad idea to remind people that certain principles of Bitcoin should not change. The freedom of miners to use their hash as they please is quite important in my opinion. My answer wasn't meant as an accusation, I just thought it was a good opportunity to talk about this.

As real as they get, you have a signed transaction to broadcast that confirms that. You just can't use them on-chain until it is settled, but any attempt from your counterparty to claim otherwise with an older signed transaction risks losing all their funds.

To be fair, comparing LN nodes and Bitcoin Cash nodes is not really meaningful. Transacting on LN requires you to have your own node, transacting on Bitcoin Cash can be achieved without your own node (using SPV nodes, which are not counted in statistics... but also trade off a bit of trustlessness that you'd have with your own node).
We should stick to comparisons which are meaningful, such as the bottom-line most people are looking at: the actual fees they pay on average for their transactions. LN makes this relatively unbeatable, once you've allocated a certain sum in one or more channels and paid the on-chain fees for this/theses transactions you can divide these fees by as many transactions as you'd like because they each cost an insignificant amount (often 1 or even 0 sat sometimes)... and you still keep control of this money on-chain at any time (you can close your channels when you want).
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:52:52
And they are not "locked" out of your control either while *in* a channel, you can decide to close your channel at any time by broadcasting the last valid state on Bitcoin network. You restore complete control over these funds as soon as you get few confirmations on that closing transaction.

Changing the blocksize limit isn't "another protocol", it's a change to Bitcoin that did not garner overwhelming consensus for over two year.

If moderators did that they would miss out on good content and I would certainly enjoy reading it on the few other subreddits I frequent.

[Andreas Antonopoulos answers this question in detail in one of his recent video]( To summarize, the level of trust you put in developers and hardware in the case of hardware wallets is really low compared to any solution most of users would come up on their own. So it implies some trust, but far less than other solutions. His answer is much more detailed so it's worth a watch.
One thing he barely mentions is that those manufacturers/developers are also running companies which would be liable if they actually used their product to steal funds. Bitcoin related or not, they still have to operate within the borders of laws as other companies and they put their reputation on the line with every product they sell. When you have an actual product, the incentives of running a successful business are often greater than the ones of scamming everyone and risking to get in a lot of trouble for it.

Hence why I say "try". Being misled or limited in the options they choose do not warrant to dicourage them. Being helpful and finding productive ways for them to actually benefit from all the advantages of Bitcoin without a third-party holding their funds seem like a better approach to me.
Merchants who make a step towards Bitcoin deserve to be welcomed with more than "you are doing everything wrong", you share good resources with them, I just find that you do it in a rather abrupt way, blaming them for something they might not know or had to choose due to a limited budget (i.e. using an available payment option in their e-commerce solution vs. having to change their e-commerce solution or develop the payment integration).
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:01:20
Sure, fortunately people tend to become very unhappy about it and voice their concern about exchanges really fast when they do this. We fallback to a reputation thing on this, but we're already trusting third parties in this context so it's bound to happen one way or an other. On a side note, this is not a concern on truly decentralized exchanges.
If we take some step back we could consider this a transitional phase, not that centralized are anywhere close to disappear, but the more people start holding and using cryptocurrencies, the less relevant the exchanges providing on/off ramps to fiat become relevant and those are the ones which are pressured by government for your private information.

As much as I do not like Roger Ver and the way he intends to confuse people by advertising BCash as "Bitcoin" on bitcoin.com, this wallet is [open-source]( so the tools to prove your allegations are there. The fact that he did not answer your requests for help is not a proof of anything.
EDIT: On a side note, the fact that it is a SPV wallet might be the cause of this required network connection, even if it is not necessary to generate private keys, some other features might trigger a network call to the trusted nodes to verify the related addresses. I have not reviewed the code, I am just purely speculating and as I do not plan to use this product I doubt I will take the time to review it. So I would agree with you OP, for now I would stay away from this software.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:01:38
It also makes running your own non-mining full node less and less accessible (storage and especially bandwidth will become an issue). So the only nodes left on the network able to enforce consensus rules will become the mining nodes.
This is routinely dismissed by proponent of BCH by claiming that non-mining nodes are not useful to the network despite the fact that Satoshi themselves wrote this in the whitepaper they so adamantly defend:

Anyways, you are saying comparable systems already exist to pay for phone services and I just pointed out that it exists only in terms of billing, not settlement. LN solves it at the settlement level because it is instantaneous from the LN point of view and can be achieved shortly on-chain if needed.

This is rich coming from the same people who plan to have to rely on SPV nodes to "verify" in the future. The plan is unlimited blocksize if you want the same throughput of transactions that something like LN, so most users won't be **able** financially and technically (bandwidth and computer processing power) to run their own node to verify as you suggest.

Yes because when I say "alternative", for some reasons (mainly because I'm grounded in reality) I strongly imply solutions that can work and haven't been demonstrated to not be immediately ruined by the current system. You still fail to provide any alternative that can practically be implemented without having some magical switch to change everyone's opinion at the same time.
I've read those books and that's the extent of the applications they suggest in general, "if only everyone was to agree to switch then maybe it could work", so *revolutionary* and so doomed to fail that it's laughable. But keep pretending you have "solutions", and keep never actually describing how we should transition to them or how they would work on a global scale. It really does wonder to your cause, I mean you and your kind have been writing books about it for decades now and not a single one of these *revolutionary* ideas ever materialized, go figure.


No thanks, you've displayed enough self-importance in two messages without even providing any useful answer that I can safely pass on this.


I've already established that it's only a contradiction if you presume that your solutions work and you haven't proven them to work at ANY scale. Many of them actually don't work at all or consistently fail to gather enough traction to even be tested before they get scrapped for the way people behave currently.
So again, come at me with actual solutions and not unproven fantasy scenarios that you and I know are impractical in reality... and if you don't do it for me, do it for the audience you think you're preaching to, I'm sure they'll be interested in those solutions, or you don't care about *enlightening* them either? Or maybe you don't have any? Which one is it?


So much self-righteousness, it's dumfounding... but you're the one making extraordinary claims (pretending the system transition to your ideologies) and you won't back them up by explaining how they would happen in practice. I don't "hate" your solution, we as a society already attempted few of them a various scales and they all failed hard (often causing a lot of harm) and you provide **no practical way** to implement them at a global scale where they **could** have a chance to maybe work.

I'm not a fan of BitPay but I live in a world where everything is not just black or white.
I fair well know that merchants using them or Coinbase Commerce are not actually using Bitcoin in a way that they control their funds at all times, but I also know the imperatives of running a business. So I usually tell them that it's a good first step towards Bitcoin and that they really should push their e-commerce solution developers to support a BTCPay Server integration (their voice as actual merchants is meaningful for developers).
Running a BTCPay Server is not completely a one button push process but any decent *webmaster* can get around setting one up with their tutorials (the docker images are really great for this). As you've pointed out the missing pieces are effectively the e-commerce integration (notably for Shopify... though it is [supposedly currently being developed](

Those nodes can be private and not be listed/discoverable by other LN nodes in certain wallet implementations (yet), but they still are nodes on the network (they can actively send transactions, open/close channels... all of this trustlessly). This is how the peer-to-peer Lightning Network is formed. I don't know what to tell you, you can keep claiming it is misinformation, these additional evidences prove that it is not.
@_date: 2019-08-14 10:23:50
LN does obscure the source of the funds that are going back to your SegWit addresses, so yes it does technically add risks for people who accept them, but you can't know what happened on LN... So in the end businesses do not seem to care (yet) and consider them just as valuable as coins on legacy addresses.
This is similar to what will happen on the new privacy schemes. That's why I drew this parallel, I'm not sure why you ignore it and only evaluate only what happens on chain, LN is much more than "packing multiple transactions into a block".


Yes and? As I've said for each exchange that does this there is an exchange in another jurisdiction that will accept them and compete with them. Which one do you think will survive in the long run?

It's not "my suggestion", it's the law. I've merely described it and illustrated it with an example to counter your argument that having "any caveat" to speech make it not free. It's just not the case, we have them all the time for valid reasons and we still enjoy freedom of speech.


This point makes literally no sense, nobody here claimed that making laws solved issues all the time (that's the second time you point to some nirvana fallacy, careful one might think you're arguing in bad faith). We create laws as a framework to install justice, not as a catch-all solution to solve 100% of the crimes or even do it a priori... although there is an argument on how dissuasive certain laws/penalites can be a priori in specific cases.


The illegality/bans are established a posteriori, nobody argued for them to happen a priori, so I have no idea why you are trying to make this argument here.

The device limitation is most likely due to hardware, these include a physically unclonable function (PUF) to handle encrypted data in complete isolation from the rest of the hardware.
The region limitation might be related to certain countries prohibiting certain type of encryption but that's just a guess on my part.

Just a nitpick, the Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm can change but it would require a hardfork which is unlikely to reach consensus among users/miners.
Typically miners who are seriously invested in Bitcoin factor in this algorithm when building/running their operation and consider it as a constant. Unless the changes to the DAA are uncontroversial (fixing a bug/security issue, etc.) they are very unlikely to happen especially if they affect the economical incentives of miners.

You won't reach the "detailed investigation" stage if you straight up dismiss it because one of its developer was not using your favorite secure OS.


There is this observable behavior that is detrimental to idea sharing and I've suggested that we refrain from doing it to facilitate collaboration. It has nothing to do with appeasing a "need to be offended", I'm not sure where you got that from. I've also qualified it of "toxic" because it does pollute this space with counterproductive tribalism.
When it comes to projection you are the one who seem to have unresolved feelings that make you hate a piece of software so much that you are ready to dismiss/ignore anything close to it (or at least justify doing it) although it can make you miss on good projects (like Bitcoin) and discourage their creators from sharing their ideas in the future.


My suggestion is to do better than relying on luck or more open-minded people to do the discovery by just stopping to use meaningless arbitrary criterion to dismiss developers when they share their ideas/code.
I have no idea why this seems to be so controversial for you, you can still advocate against Windows and promote Linux for its far superior security and the simple fact that it is open source (like I generally do), while keeping an open-mind when it comes to evaluating software or ideas that come from other software ecosystems.


Thanks for making my point, I want it to be easier to find it, and not miss it just because some tribe decided to shutdown the efforts of others developers because they were using the "wrong" OS or their haircut wasn't clean enough or any other meaningless criteria like these.

That sounds pretty cool, but I wonder how the transmission of the initial secret could be done without having to explain it to users and possibly without another app than the LN wallet/node (in the example they suggest exchanging it outside of LN through a messaging app).

What makes you think I fail to understand this?
The argument is that it would have been found and improved (i.e. ported to Linux) earlier if those people weren't so dismissive for meaningless reasons.
In other words if they evaluate software in a more efficient manner, not just based on the OS used, programming language used, the username a developer has chosen, or whatever inanity they have decided to rile up against this time, they would not delay innovation the same way. I've made this point in my first answer to you and I still hold this view:

They exist in terms of billing, not in terms of settled transactions. Your money isn't in the pocket of the merchants using these billing schemes until the banks decide to settle them (in the case of credit cards this effective settlement can be 120-180 days later).
In other words, merchants have to account for the eventual chargebacks, frauds, etc. and factor these in theirs prices or limit their services accordingly.
LN solves this because you instantly provide the merchants with a transaction that they can either settle on-chain relatively quickly (depends on the fee they are willing to pay and the network's congestion) or they can keep it on LN to transact with other peers (their providers, benefits programs for their customers, etc.). In either cases they have access to/control of their money in a much shorter time frame.

And my answer was to someone pointing out how Satoshi ran Windows and you pointing out the reaction he got from his peers when presenting his idea.


I'm pointing out this principle that can be applied to software developers sharing their ideas with their peers and I've used Satoshi as the example since it was the topic of the discussion. No idea why you came to the conclusion that I'm white-knighting Satoshi in particular, I guess it's just an attempt to make fun of me to try to discredit the principle... maybe attack the idea instead if you don't agree with it.


Maybe? Who knows? How is this relevant? This kind of reception from your peers when you present an idea is still not productive.


They didn't just make a "factual observation" according to you, the judged and dismissed the idea based on this. That's the toxic behavior I would prefer people to avoid.

This is a borderline nirvana fallacy. As I've just said, if you are 1 uncensorable transaction away from making your coins fungible, pretty much all the coins that can move are fungible. The ones that can't move don't matter.
Can coins that aren't taking part in this exist? Yes. Will they be less valuable? No, because if you ever have to deal with them, 1 transaction later your next counterparties won't be able to tell them apart from others. And you as the owner of those coins can initiate this transaction whenever you please... so why would you or anyone value those coins differently?
Some businesses might refuse to accept coins from Schnorr signature addresses in the beginning but for each service that might do this you'll find another that will be glad to accept them and compete this way. Just like you found services that were glad to support SegWit really quickly and other that still to this day lag behind and are pretty much irrelevant now.

Hopefully this will shake things up in other pools and make them adopt BetterHash (I suspect it's one of the main goals of Blockstream here... besides mining revenues of course).
As a miner I wouldn't hesitate to switch for a BetterHash pool for too long if conditions (revenue mainly) were roughly the same. It's a nobrainer considering how much it would improve the decentralization (and implicitly the value) of Bitcoin's network. So other pools are going to have to react quickly or they will lose of lot of their miners.

That's your argument and I tend to agree with it.
The argument I've answered to is:


Or in other words "if there is **any** caveat to free speech, it's not free speech". The caveat I've described is justified and legally established (for the reasons you've also mentioned) and we still enjoy free speech despite it (actually thanks to it if you think about it).
What Brokeheadadvice argues in favor of ("not any caveat") is an unrealistic interpretation of freedom of speech, that's why I called it mythical.
I usually try to be charitable when I read blanket statements like this but they are defending a platform that is mainly known for helping white nationalists/supremacists and racists of all kinds to spread calls to violence and hate. Those are clear attacks to actual freedom of speech and are part of the necessary caveats we are talking about. Their intention (I am not including Brokeheadadvice in this, he/she might just defend the platform and not these people) is to suppress the speech ability or even the existence of whole fringes of the population by violent or ostracizing means.

Hopefully nobody. There are awesome people in the Bitcoin ecosystem but none should be given this role.
Looking for leaders in a decentralized system is like implementing an attack vector in it if they have a direct impact on it. What happens when they get compromised/silenced/etc.? In my opinion this is the main reason why the absence of Satoshi is a good thing for Bitcoin.
Look at code (if you can), define the rules you want for your money and choose/build the software to run to enforce them. This doesn't require leaders, it will require collaboration which isn't the same as following someone's directives/influence.

I do, I was referring to you straw-manning me, pretending I was asking you to give up on listening to ideas coming from the Linux ecosystem in your analogy when I never have and then using this figure of speech to push the fallacy even further.


Whether you dismiss ideas coming from Windows developers or not, ideas are still going to be infinite. You use a set of criteria to filter them and "which OS was used to develop it" is a meaningless criteria **when you evaluate the idea**. It can be a meaningful criteria when you evaluate the security of the realization of this idea, or when you have to decide if you can run it on your system or not for example, which both come way after evaluating the idea itself.
The reason why you keep ignoring this simple distinction is beyond me, you must hate having to concede anything or you are actually ready to throw the baby out with the bathwater just to be able to smugly claim you've never had anything to do with Windows. Either way it's a dead-end for any constructive discussion here.

It's not just being "dismissive", it's intolerance, they didn't want Satoshi to contribute with his ideas because of the software he was using. Satoshi was only able to still contribute because they didn't get discouraged by it and those gatekeepers aren't the majority.
I fail to see how you justify the gatekeepers' actions here, my point is to remove those gates and let people collaborate more efficiently, what is your actual point? Just defend the right of people to choose to be intolerant?

You do not need to know the "optimal" route as you say, it is a goal to find it but you can find working routes without knowledge of the entire network.
Many LN detractors use this appeal to purity to claim that until the traveling salesman problem has a perfect resolution for all transactions it cannot work and this is fallacious. The best proof currently is that without such a perfect scenario people already transact successfully on LN and the simulations with enough gateway routing nodes still work.
Just like you can overpay fees for on-chain transactions, you can choose a sub-optimal routes for LN transactions, knowingly or because your current connectivity/channel setup does not allow you to find a better one yet.

And this makes him is a prime target if anyone powerful want change the course of Ethereum again.

With credit cards this settlement is actually definitive only much later, 120-180 days later (the usual period when chargebacks are still possible). While waiting for this the money is advanced by the banks within few days, but they are contractually allowed to take it back if they suspect that the payment is fraudulent.
They usually side with a customer who claims it was fraudulent by default and might allow you to jump through hoops to get the money back by providing evidences that it was effectively their customer who allowed the payment (for online payments it is not always easy at all).

But the facts that there is activity on the network (active nodes, channels with liquidity, etc.), that [thousands businesses do support payments with LN]( (that's one among other payment processors) and finally that you can use it yourself to buy goods/services right now should be enough clues for you to conclude that this isn't "a tech demo".

It's literally some people who thought it would be fun to make dogs race, it's literally some people who thought it would be fun to make horses race, etc. And then make a business out of betting on those... and we invariably see the same results in terms of animal abuse happen stemming from those "literal" *innocent* ideas.
The fact that we both eat meat in a system that was built to make us eat meat and enjoy it isn't a justification to continue creating new ways to exploit other animals in new ways.
Your only justification right now is "because it's fun" and you decide to disregard the actual comfort of other living creatures. If you're fine admitting this, good, if you're not and want to say it's "right" to do it you'll need a better justification to introduce morality in this.

What a very generous way to put it.
They have tested it on 240 people (out of which only 72 even cared to vote... both the sample size and their apathy are laughable), in a stable region (Zug in Switzerland), where identities were issued and verified in physically based on a centralized register (by the Zug authorities). And you just *simply* claim that it is "working" but you are surprised when people think your approach is naive?
Electronic and online voting are NOT solved by far, go learn some more about the actual challenges you are supposed to overcome ([this is a good video outlining them]( before claiming that it's working... and maybe come back when an actual country has provably used such a revolutionary system, transparently, without massive frauds, without exposing each voter's privacy and the anonymity of their vote to huge risks.

You require your own Lightning Network node (your wallet), it's a client you use to participate in this peer-to-peer network. OP is comparing the number of those LN nodes to a number of Bitcoin Cash full nodes. This is why I say the comparison is not meaningful. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough, by no means was I trying to spread "misinformation", maybe I should have been more verbose in my description.
To clarify, you can participate on Lightning Network without your own Bitcoin full node by using an SPV approach which works by connecting to multiple Bitcoin nodes to verify the on-chain transactions for your LN node. This is done in a trustless manner and as you said works for many users. It would still be better if you ran your own Bitcoin node and verified those transactions yourself to preserve a more trustless approach... but for the sums involved in microtransactions the SPV approach isn't that troublesome.

It isn't fungible yet, Bitcoin developers have been working towards solutions to solve this by improving privacy (Schnorr/signature aggregation and Taproot). Then it will be a matter of using those scheme to make sure your coins are not distinguishable from others.
There will still be coins that won't move, people who will not want to use these schemes, don't know how to use them, etc. (just like some people refuse/ignore how to use SegWit and end up paying more fees when they transact...). But at this point fungibility for them would be one transaction away between two addresses they'd own (i.e. nobody could easily prevent them to make their coins fungible).

Comparing existing miners colluding off-chain and then joining force on-chain to control which blocks should be orphaned because they didn't like the transactions they included vs. Enabling and/or using a P2P mechanism for nodes to express their position and ultimately enforcing it by applying the new rules if the majority was reached... sure very potent comparison... if you are in "lala land" I guess. 
No miner was kicked because it wasn't the goal of the UASF, first and foremost it was a way to leverage the potential of non-mining nodes which have weight on the network with their economic activity and then go their own way if the message wasn't clear enough to miners. As you witnessed miners didn't want to take this risk, was it only because of UASF or because of it at all? Who cares, it was a  manifestation of their ability to voice their opinion on the future of Bitcoin's network using this network... it didn't alter the immutability of the blockchain, unlike what miners did on BCH.

No, I've been talking about a developer's choice of software to formalize their ideas and share them from the start, not "people" in general. I haven't suggested anything else, it's on you if you thought this applied to everyone running Bitcoin in production, it clearly doesn't and I have never used this argument.
I'll reformulate the original point if it wasn't clear enough: judge **software developers trying to share their ideas** (in this specific case Satoshi) on their ideas/outputs and not the software used to produce them. Don't be toxic to them just because they didn't pick the software you prefer. This is how you breed a welcoming ground for everyone involved in sharing ideas.
You can criticize them for their choices (very justifiably so in the case of Windows to handle money in production), but ignoring/discarding their ideas because of their initial choice is counterproductive.

You and I hope for this, but you must have figured out by now that Bitcoin wouldn't have gained the same sort of interest if all the developers in this space were like those hacktivists you were talking about and never released any miner, wallets, etc. for Windows. It's still the dominant platform for workstations and having this ostracizing attitude they had back then is useless to their cause. Worse it can be detrimental, it could have made them miss on a good opportunity like Bitcoin to change things if they had successfully discouraged Satoshi.

That's not a slippery slope, at best if you had any argument to show me those industries are disanalogous it would be a false equivalency. Since you have no example of an ethical way to do this kind of gambling without enabling animal abuse at a larger scale I rest my case that with similar motivation in a similar setting the consequences are very likely to be the same. I don't intend to "test" this by promoting this activity because it could cause considerable and additional suffering. So yes I will argue against such practice, it's as simple as this. Being consistent here demand me very little effort, compared to changing eating habits I've acquired by tradition over decades for example. Being conscious of such inconsistencies is a necessary step before being able to act to change them. If you can change them or prevent them before they are normalized or become an habit why wouldn't you do it?


Their level of sentience is a non-sequitur. They are living beings that you purposefully breed hoping to profit from the gambling you'll organize on their back.


An other non-sequitur, it doesn't justify their usage for gambling. But I do agree that in certain contexts (life-saving or suffering-reducing) their sacrifice can be justified, this is so far detached from the "amusement" you find seeing mice racing around that we can safely say it's another debate.


Once less scrupulous owners will join in and push boundaries of this exploitation, as it's the case with every similar gambling operation, they are likely going to be mistreated too. Even with authorities supervising this in other industries it still happens on a regular basis, why would you think that an eventually developed industry of mice racing would be any different? I'm basing it on observations, on what do you base your opinion that it will just be fine this time?


I haven't argued that those specific mice were mistreated, I'm arguing against promoting this concept and making it popular and acceptable. If you can't find a moral justification for this, it's not moral.


Oh man, that's exactly what I've said and admitted... and we're pretty much on a level ground for this. I still don't intend to create new ways to perpetuate even more inconsistencies than the ones I already live with, using those to justify this would be another occasion to not try to change and just repeat the same errors.


I'm absolutely not worked up over this, I'm explaining why you and Bitfriday cannot pretend that it should be normal or "right" to enjoy this activity. Continue doing it if you feel like it, just don't pretend it's moral, just like I don't pretend my eating habits are moral. If it was required to be morally perfect to be able to assess this kind of issue then nothing would ever change and it would be a race to the bottom.


I'm not convince we actually disagree on the morality of exploiting animals for this. There are plenty of other ways to gamble without causing suffering, my point is we should concentrate on those and attempt to stay away from the ones which have pretty predictable results in terms of the additional suffering they can cause.

How come your business which promotes non-custodial usage of Bitcoin (which is awesome) isn't using a solution like BTCPay Server to receive bitcoins as payments for your products?
And if this isn't possible because you want to convert to fiat directly for accounting purposes: why choose Bitpay out of all the other payment gateways that provide the same if not better services?
Bitpay provides the most dreadful experience for users during Bitcoin payments:
* They charge so-called "network fees" in addition to the fees we pay for the Bitcoin transaction.
* They warn people about Bitcoin "slow confirmations" by email for each purchase, even when the mempool is almost empty and 1 sat/vbyte transactions are mined in the next block. No such warning for BCH payments though although they have blocks every 3 hours lately... which demonstrates the clear bias they have against Bitcoin.
* They force users to pay using their **proprietary** payment protocol/URL's which aren't supported by many Bitcoin wallets.
Almost all their competitors do not do any of this and have comparable rates for your business. Please consider those issues and try to improve our user experience in your shop, this payment processor is most likely making you lose many sales.

You can preserve your privacy quite decently if you are careful enough. Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous, unless you link your identity to one of your addresses (doing KYR/AML procedures on exchanges, not using Tor when broadcasting your transactions/using Bitcoin, etc.) someone would be hard pressed to attribute it to you specifically.
But it's not an ideal system, privacy should be an inherent feature of Bitcoin, it should happen by default and not require you to jump through hoops to achieve it. This is why a lot of development happens in this area: Schnorr signatures/signatures aggregation, Confidential Transactions, mixing, second layers solutions like LN (but these last ones would be vastly better with a first layer with strong privacy obviously).
@_date: 2019-06-15 10:43:37


The very first paragraph of the OP ;)
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:38:02


No idea how deep you "investigated" but if you just checked the address balance on BSV and not the transaction that "stole" the fund from you, take a look. I'm not sure if that's what happened to you but you might just have unintentionally broadcasted the BCH transaction on both BSV and BCH (or someone might just replay them to disrupt people who attempt what you were trying for example).
There's no replay protection between BSV and BCH as far as I know so you might just need to check the destination address(es) you've used on your BCH transaction on BSV's chain. Obviously if you sent the funds directly to a an exchange's address they might just tell you your funds are gone (because they kept them and/or don't want to deal with BSV) or may be refunded (depends the policy of exchanges/conversion services and your input(s))... might be worth a second look depending on how much pre-forks BTC you had ;)
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:34:11
I doubt many exchanges allow $1 worth withdrawals. There are some exchanges that will pay the fees for you though.
But if your question is about sending them from your wallet to somebody else and you aren't in a hurry to settle the transaction you can set the lowest fee 1 sat/vB. For a simple SegWit transaction you'd pay about 150-200 sats to move them. The delay before your first confirmation will vary a lot depending on the current demand for block space on Bitcoin (the number of "pending" transactions in the nodes' mempool).
For such low value transactions second layer solutions like Lightning Network are more appropriate. Funding a wallet takes an on-chain transaction (currently), you'd usually do this when fees are low or in advance like you would maintain a certain balance on your checking account and then you'd be able to send bitcoins for about 1 sat per transaction (sometimes even less since it's possible to transact in millisatoshis on LN).

Your example, an abusive child, is a straw man because it is specific and describe only one possible alternative for the fate of these animals with only negative outcomes.
Greed isn't a straw man, it is the motivation behind this gambling, you aren't doing it for the pleasure of these mice.
It also dictate that mice that are not profitable in races because they refuse to race or become too slow when they get old or sick are useless and should be destroyed in favor of more profitable ones.
The abuse and exploitation of animals in the gambling circles aren't "hypothetical" I have just linked two sources documenting them and there are plenty more cases like these. You pretending that they are hypotheticals is just a display of bad faith.

Very nice technical summary, thanks for the write-up.


Schnorr's patent ([US07/484,127]( expired in 2010. More than 9 years after this expiration the discouragement to include this signature scheme in Bitcoin along the way isn't mainly related mainly to this. Unless there's another patent I'm not aware of?
The other part of your explanation is more likely to be the reason for the "slow" progress. It's an active area of research and making sure that the **applications** of the Schnorr signatures scheme will work for Bitcoin in practice how they work in theory/test environments is another story. When it's supposed to secure the largest cryptocurrency in the world (and not ruin an already problematic scaling) you don't take chances and you act conservatively even if they can be implemented using softfork(s). So until they are in a usable state it makes little sense to *push* the signature scheme in production.
If you want an example of why they aren't in Bitcoin yet, look who is using Schnorr signatures in BCH: nobody. They hardforked it more than a month ago by mostly copying Bitcoin's developers work ([without crediting them]( just to be able to say "we were first" and run a marketing campaign on this (hoping it would pump their coin's value I guess). But there's no application for it yet. Sorry for going a bit off-topic but the rush for a new address scheme topic made me think about how this went down recently.

To be honest, it's partially the costs of transacting on Bitcoin's network and consolidating their outputs too, and other operational fees (support, etc.). All of which shouldn't be called just "Network fee".
They aren't transparent as to which part of this total Bitcoin network fee. They are also not transparent about the costs for Bitcoin Cash, even if it's low for the reasons listed in the OP, it's still not free. With about 1 billion dollars worth of transactions handled by Bitpay last year, 95% of which used Bitcoin (and logically 5% BCH) it's certainly not a negligible sum of money they can just ignore/gift to users.
Chances are they just pass those costs on the people using Bitcoin, to make BCH look like a free alternative, they have been very early adopters and promoters of BCH (most likely due to their very close relation with Bitmain). It's within their prerogatives of course, it's their business, but it's one more reason for me not to do business with them and recommend to people to avoid them.

You're ignoring the context of your initial intervention, either on purpose or because you're clueless about its importance. When someone else was saying that "Hardware wallets are just expensive usb sticks.", I've answered it is a stupid idea and you've joined the discussion to praise the merits of using airgapped systems over this, you aren't just pointing out the "technical security between two types of wallets", you are advocating the use of a solution over an other one. Exactly what Andreas denounces in the video, but you seem unable to understand the responsibility you have when giving such advice on public forums.
You can also keep your ad homiems to yourself, if you had actual arguments you wouldn't need that but it's pretty apparent that it's the only thing you have left in your untenable position.
I didn't want to address this earlier because I felt it was pointless since you seem to firmly believe the only way is airgapped, but I guess it might serve to point out how what Andreas says about people overestimating their skills/abilities when it comes to netsec applies to your case:


Unless you have verified the source code and compiled it yourself for the whole chains of open source software used in your "old android phone" (and do this on an existing airgapped system... who knows what can happen on a compromised computer when compiling), when you "disable all comms" you have no idea of what is exactly disabled or not.
There have been instances of phones implementing call-to-home features (i.e. sending data over mobile network and GPS) while powered-off (you'd have to physically remove the battery to prevent it). There are also demonstrated achievable data leaking over NFC (c.f. [NFCdrip]( up to 100m away which is available in many phones. Two very potent ways to leak data while you think you have "disabled all comms".
And lastly your "old android phone" was most likely online at some point, which also implies it never was an airgapped system to being with, unless as I said earlier you wiped it clean and built its software from source in a secured environment... At which point, by the way, you would still be at "mercy that the hardware and firmware is good" to use your own argument against the solution you pretend is good.
You are clearly out of your depth when recommending this to common users, and you seem to be unaware of the effects those bad advice have. The real danger here is you and your overconfidence in your limited skills, I really couldn't care less what it means for you as an individual, from the beginning my point is for people like you to stop inciting others to follow the same path as you, because most users are not competent enough to setup and maintain an airgapped system securely.

One of the effects of creating bitcoins is inflation, it's basic economics ([see the first chart]( the second "cause").
This effect is mitigated by the almost certain fixed supply and mostly eclipsed by the great volatility of Bitcoin. As Swung_and_mist pointed out, it's better to talk about it as a disinflationary asset, there is a base inflation planned in the issuance schedule and it's diminished over time to tend to 0.
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:08:01
The word is "trust", not just believe. And that's the fundamental difference between Bitcoin and all these so-called stablecoins (of course that implies price volatility as long as it will be used mainly speculatively). Those "stablecoins" could be stable enough but they will forever rely on the stability of their underlying assets... most of which are inflation prone ones.
And when the only guarantee you'll have is going to be the word of an association founded and controlled by Facebook that everything is fine and audited, it's a lot of trust. Maybe even more than the trust most people currently put in banks and central banks.
Also their announced goal to help unbanked people will be really short lived as they are going to have to deal with the same KYC/AML procedures than everyone else in traditional banking. They are privately owned entities, they can't just claim it's different because it's a cryptocurrency, they will be held accountable if money is transmitted without supervision using the system they contribute to (financially and with IT resources). This doesn't apply to Bitcoin because anyone can participate on the network in an anonymous manner (if wanted/required), this isn't the case with a federation of companies with legal status and addresses.

Not sure what you mean there, maybe you're just trolling, but I do support Bitcoin and its principles. I just don't need conspiracy theories to explain my desire to be able to use sound money and take back the control we've left exclusively to central banks for way too long.
They are pretty open about their goal of suppressing one of the last form of money you can spend/receive without their consent (cash) and if it was the only reason to support Bitcoin it would be enough in my eyes but there are plenty other reasons too.

It was really not the point you attacked, re-read the message you answered to. I'm pointing out that hardware wallets are more than just expensive USB sticks, you answer by saying "yeah but airgapped is better"... to which I say when it's only better if you really really know what you are doing, which most users are not able to do... so an hardware wallet will be better for them and messing up when trying air gapped... or as Andreas says giving up and going for a custodial solution.
We do agree that airgapped is the best you can do in theory... but you don't seem to be willing to admit it's not a solution most people are able to achieve without messing up at some point (when setting it up or when trying to actually use Bitcoin later).

Just for accuracy, they decide when to spend them after the maturation time which is 100 blocks, before this the coins are not spendable.
Also, those rewards are indeed accounted in the price people are willing to give, their creation is currently inflating Bitcoin's supply and people do account for it in the value they are willing to give/spend for their bitcoins.

I also didn't know about this wallet, the 2 out of 2 signature scheme to integrate fraud protection for payments is interesting. I don't have time to test it now, I read that the second key is also stored on the phone, so is there a way to "skip" the fraud protection by selecting an option if desired when sending a transaction?

Yeah, I agree, it's a pity that the chain stopped so soon, the spirit of the movement was to promote/demonstrate a fun way to use LN to try it out. Even if he donates it now to a charity he somewhat stopped something cool in its track.
On the other hand with human nature involved, sooner or later someone would have done it in his place, some people just have a much lower bar for what is worth 15 minutes of fame (in this case to become infamous).
This kind of greed is at play in the game theory principles that make the balance of power between Bitcoin's participants somewhat predictable. So it's hard to blame anyone for demonstrating that there will always be "this guy". It just proves that the system must work *with* them by using their potentially destructive behavior and leverage it into something virtuous for the system. That's in my opinion one of the most ingenuous way Satoshi designed Bitcoin, all technical details aside.

[Most users are better off using hardware wallets and have a good offline backup plan for their seed(s)](
There are a many occasions to fuck up in the simple procedure you've described. In terms of setup you are already relying on software and hardware that can easily have been compromised by being online at any point. A simple example would be a keylogger, any *decent* one will keep working after you've unplugged your network cable and will just leak your seed/keys next time the computer goes online.
And if you'd recommend a truly airgapped systems to do it, it wouldn't be much better, they are very difficult to setup and maintain, so advocating for common users to rely on them is irresponsible. I don't know your skill level, you might very well be careful and knowledgeable enough to make one, I'm talking about the general message addressed to common users of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-07 18:49:27
Indeed and with a decentralized system there won't really be a way to censor them. If you believe in Bitcoin's fundamental properties should make you happy because it's the same, nazis and incels can freely use it.
This freedom, granted to every user, comes with the cost of having to relentlessly fight those ideas as we won't be able to simply sweep them under the rug as we do on centralized platforms. Up until now it was the way we fought them and clearly it hasn't solved the problem (quite the contrary if you consider the growth of neo-nazis movements in EU for example).
It's also mostly done this way because it allows the owners of those platforms to keep their advertisers paying. If their sponsors were fine with nazis/etc. they'd most certainly fight against governments for these users' "freedom of speech" (read advertisement profits) so leaving this *choice* in the hands of few large companies is also very questionable.
Anyways even if you don't support platforms like Gab you're engaging in a fight against a concept, an idea, not just a company. Ideas like these are pretty much decentralized once they reach a large public once, they propagate quickly, you can't prevent someone to think/remember them and anyone who comes in contact with them can develop the desire to use or create their own.
In those conditions if you actually manage to take one down because it's not decentralized enough you will see few more pop up in a relatively short time, usually improved ones that are much harder to take down... and you can't really stop this, you can adapt to them, just like our societies are currently adapting to Bitcoin.

There are mitigation solutions for this though, lnd has implemented [Static Channel Backups]( for example. It's still additional data compared to just a seed but it's as close to a "way around" it we are now. Hopefully there's more progress done in this area to make it easier, but like you I think it's doubtful we'll ever have just a "seed restore" feature working on its own.

They have issues, their plan towards terabytes blocks/adaptative block size is hypothetical at best. Their lab tests with 1GB blocks are exactly that, limited to a lab environment... They weren't even able to sustainably scale to their current limit of 32MB during their mainnet stresstests.
Their whole plan is based on the hope that technological advancements in computing and bandwidth keep a certain pace and geographical distribution (both of which have shown clear limits in recent years). But you're right, they don't need money to fix those because they aren't limits they, as developers, have any control over. Both are infrastructure issues.
Bitcoin supporters have chosen to deal with limits they actually have control over to preserve the fundamental attributes of the system they want to use. Using the infrastructure we're afforded now and in a close future. Helping them seem to be a much more pragmatic way to use of these funds in this context.

General purpose optical discs also have a relatively limited lifespans if they aren't stored appropriately (no sunlight, not exposed too much heat, no scratches, etc.). You generally shouldn't store unique data you expect to retrieve in decades on them.
Furthermore there's no guarantee to have an easy access the necessary hardware to read them in such a long time (less and less general purpose computers come with optical disc readers). It *shouldn't* be an issue with CD/DVD/Blurays but it's still an additional factor to consider. Imagine if you store it on a format that gets broadly replaced by another one and all readers get discontinued (HDDVD comes to mind, even if it predated Bitcoin, it's an example of how certain formats can virtually completely disappear after being accessible to the consumers).
If you can't conceive not storing it digitally, you should make sure to have multiple proper backups in different secured locations. And please test them regularly (at least yearly would be my personal recommendation). This include a full restore in secured conditions, not just checking if files are still showing up.
Lastly as OP mentioned, physical storage (laminated paper, metal engraving/stamping, etc.) are more durable but still require a lot of care for storage to protect them against natural elements and thieves.
There's no easy solution and many people will most likely still rely on third-parties to help them with this (bank safe deposit box for example). The important part is that with Bitcoin you are given the possibility to do this yourself (and assume those risks) with a bank account you have no other choice than trust said bank ;)

I won't defend the "common" part, I don't have such data and it's not my claim. For the rest, the mere fact that exchanges are centralized entities, that they keep records of all the transactions you do with them, and are forced to enforce KYC procedures is enough to justify the desire for some users to "unlink" their identity from the BTC they were provided by exchanges to preserve their privacy.


The difference is something Bitcoin doesn't have yet: fungibility. Cash money transactions are almost all done privately, without supervision of their serial numbers and the parties involved, while Bitcoin transactions are all public. Authorities obviously don't have certainty for each additional hop funds make between addresses, but with chain analysis and sufficient data from various sources (exchanges, merchants, etc.) they have the ability to trace people which is why work is being done in this area (Confidential Transactions and Mimblewimble for example).

He explains how harmful it can end up to be to advocate this to common users for securing their funds. There are also many good other advices to secure and backup your wallets in this video.
As I've pointed out, hardware wallets might not be as supposedly *perfect* as an airgapped system, but it's a level of security attainable by most users and that's the only position I was defending in my original response.

By giving you sovereignty over you money, allowing you to transact with anyone on this system without any authority having control over this ability.
You can still *mostly* do with cash currently but this ability is attacked and limited by governments all over the world. They want to push everyone to digitized and centralized systems they have complete control over and they aren't doing it just to make your life easier if that's not obvious, it's a matter of control (i.e. to restrict your rights).
It also allows you to choose if you want to be part of this system or an other, you didn't have this choice before Bitcoin and it ought to be a right in my opinion (might not be a right you had before, but it's still a right Bitcoin created).
And lastly, maybe most importantly, Bitcoin changes who is in charge of the supply of the money, removing the use of central banks which currently take arbitrary decisions (often outside of any democratic processes, or under very limited governmental supervision). When you choose to use Bitcoin you "vote" for the specific issuance schedule of bitcoins and their limited supply. Rights that haven't been afforded to you with democratic processes for a long time.

The last version of Bitcoin-Qt was 0.8.2. From version 0.9.0 the software was renamed to Bitcoin Core.
So it's very likely that you run the Bitcoin node implementation called Bitcoin Core. Generally the name of the currency/protocol isn't the one of the node software as there are multiple node implementations (Bitcore, bcoin, etc.). You could say I run a Bitcoin node or a Bitcoin Core node, both would be understood, the latter is more accurate.

A watchtower makes sure your counterparty in a LN channel is not force closing it with a less recent state than the most recent one it knows while you're offline.
It doesn't need to know your balances, who are your counterparties or the content of your transactions up to the current state. They deal with encrypted data about the last state that they can only decrypt if they can detect a fraudulent attempt to steal your funds. That's the only transaction the watchtower will "know" about and it can only be decrypted in case of fraud (the part needed to decrypt it is known only by you and your counterparty and is revealed by them when they attempt the fraud).
At this point it is the watchtower's best interest to act in your best interest since you've paid for their services and they certainly intend to continue providing it and not ruin their reputation. If that part of trust in a service you pay for is too much for you, just run a LN node yourself and make sure it's never offline for more than the duration of the grace period during which you can issue a revocation transaction yourself (varies depending on the size of the channel).
At no point a watchtower has the ability to run away with your funds like banks, and unless they want that nobody use their service they have no interest in not acting in your favor. So no, the trust is not comparable at all.

Oh yeah my bad, I was checking the wrong documentation. I suppose [this the node]( it connects to or maybe another one for production. But the point remains that it should rather be a node that you trust (i.e. your own preferably), right?
Any idea if at some point this process will be made more trustless without having to setup your own full node? Maybe based on multiple random nodes or anything that would dilute the trust and not make the default settings infrastructure a potential single point of failure?

Technically Bitcoin will remain inflationary until the year 2140, so unless you're planning to outlive everyone here you're using an inflationary currency too but it has a set issuance schedule, a fixed total supply, and those won't change unless most participants in the network decide it (which for now sounds very unlikely)... it's not decided by central banks in secret and completely outside of your control.

I've always wonder why people think this would exempt them from taxes... as if any state would take "but I lost all my money" as an excuse. Taxes are due the moment a taxable event happens, if you realized capital gains you owe taxes on them the minute you sell. If you realize losses you can write off some of them up to a certain limit.
If they can reasonably prove that the taxable event happened (i.e. you traded on an exchange which knows your identity and cooperate with your taxer), you owe them this money. No matter your financial standing when they contact you... Aside for filling some form of personal bankruptcy, debts don't vanish this way. And even if you receive a bankruptcy discharge, most taxes will not be eliminated by it either.
As the saying goes, nothing is certain but death and taxes.

I'd love to hear how exactly the payment would be stolen in this case? As far as I know if you re-use an invoice it will just get rejected by most node implementations. The ones which would not reject it would just receive the funds again (i.e. they'd have a valid transaction to claim them if they close the channel)... how is that "stolen" if the payer sent/signed the transaction?

The problem here is you're under the impression there is such thing as a free lunch... if it's free, you are the product (your time for watching ads or your personal data).
There will always be space for an ad-based or personal data resale kind of business model, but offering the option for people who'd want to avoid being the product to pay by the nanosecond instead of buying a full month subscription and only using an hour in that month is a better business model. It would ensure customers wouldn't be frustrated with a service they had to pay for but can't/don't have time to use completely.
It's worth noting too that if a service does not provide the access you want ("free"), you're always free (sic) not to use/purchase it too... if you don't think they provide you with any value it shouldn't be too hard to skip their service/content.

Schnorr signatures on their own aren't very useful, they are a building block which can help improving the efficiency and privacy of Bitcoin.
They could be softforked in Bitcoin relatively easily right now, but just like when you build a house, throwing bricks at the ground won't do much good, you need plans and purpose. Look for signature aggregation, MuSig and Taproot developments, Schnorr will be useful for those. When concrete, reviewed, tested and working use cases like those will exist there will be a reason to have Schnorr in Bitcoin and that's what Bitcoin developers are working on.
The other way is quickly hardforking Schnorr signatures in your currency on their own and have barely no use for them. That's what BCH developers did ([by using a Bitcoin Core developer's code without respecting the open source licence or credit him actually]( It doesn't make any sense except if your goal is to organize a marketing campaign to say "we have done it first". Bitcoin does not work like this, we are building decentralized, sound and secured money, not a marketing based scheme.

@_date: 2019-02-03 15:14:26


From my understanding, yes, you do. Because you are transferring a property according to [IRS's code]( and it is a taxable event.
If the valuation in USD increases between the time you've acquired your BTC and the time you've spent them, it is a form of capital gain. You realize this gain by spending BTC to pay your taxes (or any other goods or services actually).
Even if you pay directly in BTC, and even if the state for some reason didn't convert it, it is the case... As a side note they are going to use Bitpay and auto-convert it, in the hearing for this bill I remember the Commission making it clear that they don't want to deal with BTC's volatility at all and all the speakers were literally selling them Bitpay as the best solution for this.
For the people joking about *recursion*, since this taxable event would happen after your declaration (and its payment), the related taxes will just be collected in the next taxation period (provided that you respect the law and declare them). Those gains are evaluated and taxed in USD, you could pay them in BTC again and apply the same logic.


I don't see how this would be applicable here. Maybe an actual accountant might help.

Or you could refrain from building a gambling industry requiring the breeding and exploitation of these animals for your own profit. You are advocating for these animals' rights to comfortable living conditions so you should be able see how "right" it would be to avoid this as it will inevitably lead to poor living conditions for some of them. Not all the owners will act how you suggest and provide what you suggest as demonstrated by the many cases of abuse that exist in similar industries ([dog]( races) and criminal enterprises where the races are replaced by fights/deathmatches.
You just seem to value the potential profits you can make off of those living creatures more than their comfort. You've just built a straw man (the abusive child) and outlined how much you wouldn't be as abusive that, completely ignoring that such an industry always rests on the exploitation of animals and lead to abuses. You're most likely fine with this, like many people are fine with exploiting animals or even killing them to eat them (I'm one of them actually) but pretending that it's "right" is a moral consideration that isn't really consistent with what you impose on these animals for your profit.
On the other hand by pointing out how this can be problematic is doing something right, they are opening a discussion on it. You have your own conscience and you should act on it like they did.

You, in person, are not using Bitcoin if you initiated the transaction through Coinbase. Coinbase are using Bitcoin and they become the ones who decide if you can transact or not.
But it's as simple as withdrawing your Bitcoin to your own wallet and transacting yourself to solve this. You would also not run the risk of Coinbase running away or confiscating your money then.

Not sure why this would be an unpopular opinion, day traders have been doing this for decades on ForEx markets with variations of few cents on pairs like EURUSD using large leverage for example and many make a living out of it. It's not limited to individual traders, hedge funds and investment banks have teams dedicated to this.
I think what's unpopular though is telling people here that they can easily do it and that Bitcoin makes it even easier because they don't really need much leverage "thanks" to the volatility. It's false because it's a much smaller/riskier market and also mainly because day trading is an actual profession. It takes a lot of knowledge/experience and even with that many day traders fuck up their money management and go broke. All of them still rely on luck, they use TA (technical analysis) or a mix of TA and FA (fundamental analysis) for scalping, none of which have returns even close to 100%. They just use patterns and information that seem the most reliable based on the stats and their experience of each different market and assume the percentage of risk that's left.
So the people who manage to do it on Bitcoin are experienced, disciplined and very lucky at the same time. Those who come here and boast about it are either bullshitting you or are just here to exemplify the [survivorship bias principle]( Unless you intend to make a long term career out of it and have the financial means to do it (i.e. you will lose sometimes, maybe many times, and if you can't take it correctly and remain disciplined, it will go bad really quickly), do not think it is as simple as many people try to make it sound.

This kind of illusion of security is worse than no 2FA scheme at all, if someone attempts to hack you this way you'd have an even harder time to solve it with Coinbase until you can get your mobile operator to first fix their error (i.e. misattributing your number to a new SIM owned by the hacker generally).

They most likely see it as a "feature" and not an issue. They use it to:
1. Prevent customer support complaints if a transaction does get stuck, which can happen during a fee spike.
2. Advertise for the altcoin they'd like to see takeover Bitcoin because their "partner" Bitmain controls it.
They obfuscate any actual fee the altcoin has (even if it's not large currently, it's not null and they don't reveal it transparently like they do for Bitcoin) and thus apparently shift all of them on Bitcoin users.
What's funny is that even after almost 2 years of doing this, they still say [95% of the transactions still use Bitcoin]( (that's Bitpay's CEO) and not the centralized altcoin... Fooling people who use cryptocurrencies isn't as easy as they seem to think.

[He didn't create r\/btc, he likely purchased it from the original owner]( Like he has bought bitcoin\.com and  on Twitter. But you've nailed the common denominator, he uses all of them to promote his business and businesses he's invested in on a daily basis with the team moderators he built that is mainly composed of his own employees.
Their M.O. is to use very simple arguments to tackle complex issues (as most demagogues do). The answers seem simple enough that people who aren't very familiar with the actual problems will intuitively think they are evident solutions (i.e. "not enough capacity? let's just add more!") and accept them... Once you've convinced enough people with those fallacious arguments you have a decent following and you feed them with the same "PSA", "Reminder" and other "I've converted all my money/crypto to BCH" posts every single day (go look at the moderators posts and frontpage for few days). Ah and also don't forget to shit on other projects (mainly Bitcoin) on a daily basis because you foolishly hope that the failure of others will inevitably translate into a success for your businesses.
And that's how you get what r\/btc looks like now, almost nothing to do with Bitcoin, pretty much only to do with BCH... the main difference is that they won't delete posts/comments about Bitcoin in an attempt to pretend they care about free speech, they will just downvote anything positive about it in unison and make it very hard for you to contribute anything if you have a positive outlook on Bitcoin.

If by HSM you mean a secure hardware device (like a hardware wallet), how do you figure this would work?
My understanding is that private keys are required to sign the HTLC's when your peers want to transact with or through your node (or obviously when you want to transact). So they currently need to be available at all times when you're online. Having them stored on an hardware device might be useful when you're not online though, but I don't see the imperative here.

You don't, you have a potential claim for 10 bitcoins at EvilBank, as I've suggested 10 EvilBank-bitcoins (at this point you could have saved yourself the rest of the explanation, but thanks for clarifying). You only "control" them contractually with EvilBank, you don't control your keys.
You've just renounced to your option of not participating in fractional reserve banking by trusting EvilBank. 
Nobody here claimed factional reserve cannot happen, Bitcoin just offers you a way to avoid it for the money you receive (your Bitcoin cannot be taken back from you on-chain because someone didn't honor their EvilBank-Bitcoin debt) and always be able to control and verify that your money wasn't created out of thin air.
In your example, before the bike shop deposited money in EvilBank they were able to do that because they received actual bitcoins, on-chain, with their own node. And they had the same option of not continuing to participate in a fractional reserve system. All these choices are never afforded to you in fiat systems, you have to participate in fractional reserve systems to have access to banking.
Sorry for the misunderstanding if you thought I meant fractional reserve cannot happen, it can, but it's optional on Bitcoin.

I think the 4 dots position encoding you're suggesting is a bit cumbersome to punch in a small space and harder to decode as soon as letters are repeating, but it's pretty ingenious. I guess you could argue that having to keep a list of 2048 words in a specific order is also cumbersome though ;) Although if we ever are in a situation where this list of words is hard to find, I think decoding my seed won't be my main issue... and with the four letters solutions you kinda also need the list to complete the words sometimes.

I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is not synchronized yet".
Each of these transactions would need their own route with enough liquidity to arrive to the destination successfully. Considering the current source routing algorithm you could potentially send two transactions at the same time on the same route but on the first hop the node will make a choice about which transaction they will actually process and pass along first. Then when they process the second transaction if they don't have enough liquidity left to route it further I suspect that this payment would fail.
I've honestly never tested this, I've noticed that concurrency checks are done at multiple stages in LND's code so I'm going to guess they handle it this way (locks are implemented so funds aren't spent when/if the process gets parallelized from my understanding). But maybe someone with a more in-depth knowledge about this will chime in.

Supply will keep inflating thanks to the difficulty adjustment mechanism you've described.
It will stay flat once we (our descendants most likely) reach the end of block rewards near year 2140 (if Bitcoin still exists with the current rules and if we don't account for "lost"/burnt coins). It's a disinflationary process with a fixed limit in the consensus rules.

Mnuchin isn't really against Swiss numbered bank accounts, he's against the idea of people poorer than him having access to them.
Bitcoin changes this, it gives access to the same kind of instruments to everyone. And it will eventually force governments to change laws in order to be able to keep taxing enough people so they can preserve their influence (and uses).
When governments will be forced to enact such huge reforms, they might very well end up taxing many of those rich people too and this is what scares him and his very rich friends a lot.

A system from which they are not excluded.
Bitcoin is open and borderless, you technically just need mathematics to generate a wallet and transactions, and an access to Internet (or other less convenient transmission means) to broadcast your transactions.
Banks on the other hand will often refuse to provide you an account/services if you don't have a physical address, a job, enough money, etc. Depending your location they might even discriminate you based on your origin, race, religion, political opinions, etc. Bitcoin doesn't, it's again open and it's neutral.

Smartphones are meant to be used online most of the time, they include many communication channels: NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi, etc. so any wallet with private keys stored on them should be considered a hot wallet.

Whether they use their reserves to honor certain orders or not isn't really important in this context (they could even justify additional fees because of it). If it's the case they will still have to maintain those reserves, place orders and pass the fees to you in this context. As I said they (over)charge those fees because: 
1. They provide this service of trading for you on the markets when you place your order.
2. They built a business and app to make this accessible to most people, while handling the various banking regulations and the inevitable customer support.
Now don't get me wrong, I don't like Coinbase and usually discourage people using them unless necessary (at least never leave money in their custodial wallets). But no service can be free or it will be abused. Until recently Coinbase Pro allowed a completely fee-less purchase and withdraw of BTC for US and EU customers (SEPA/ACH deposites were free, limit order as a maker were free and withdrawal was also free... now only ACH deposits and the withdrawal are free and they have a 0.1% fee for makers).

In the current situation, if nobody ever sells it for "worthless paper" Bitcoin would be of very limited use. The majority of economical activity in commerce and finance happens using fiat money, this is not a negligible factor.
Behind each of your Sell order, there is a Buy order for Bitcoin, presumably because it has a use for the buyers (might be holding, spending or even just trading). This promotes economical activity in Bitcoin, this is how it becomes a currency, by definition from the latin *currēns* meaning "moving, travelling, proceeding" it has to move/flow.
But this might become true at the tipping of the scales, when Bitcoin will be used much more in commerce/finance, at this point it could be a statement you make to refuse fiat money... when it will be actually worthless to you.
@_date: 2019-12-20 08:45:02
Well if you want to go this way there's always a 0 fee transaction in every block, the coinbase one... but it's pretty meaningless in regards the analysis of this "marketing" image.


It existed to stimulate usage and still wasn't free. The block reward miners receive is inflation of the available supply which means all users are paying this to miners by diminishing the value of their coin. Even if there is a 0 fee on your transaction as long as there is a block reward you are paying miners this way, it's just indirect.
There really ain't no such thing as a free lunch, it's Proof-of-**Work** and miners are justified in wanting to be compensated for their work. It does not mean miners cannot "give" few 0 fee transactions at times (at loss), we are talking about the vast majority of transactions which will inevitably pay fees one way or another, if they don't, Bitcoin mining literally has no purpose and will stop.

There are so many wrong statements in your two sentences here that I don't understand why you've even bothered answering.
There have been intentional and unintentional forks in Bitcoin, some directly the responsibility of Bitcoin Core and didn't produce a new currency, others by minority groups/individuals which gave birth to a slew of altcoin that barely nobody uses now.
There have also been events such as Segwit2X and the USAF that clearly disprove your opinion about both miners and users being NPC's. So go learn about forks, Bitcoin's history and do a service to everyone here: don't answer about things you clearly have no knowledge about.

If I've understood correctly TravelByBit weren't even cautious about 0-conf transactions **with the RBF flag** (which are much easier to replace with a higher fee than non-RBF).
With a trivial automated verification they could advise the merchant to delay the *delivery* and avoid fraud... not ideal but really better than just ignoring this flag. In any case 0-conf should never be considered safe as you said.
It still took a dishonest BCH supporter to actually attempt to scam them. It's funny how these people have no trouble breaking the law to hurt Bitcoin's adoption on one side, and whine about it not being more adopted on the other.

I've found it after reading [Jameson Lopp's tests]( and searching for an alternative to [Blockplate]( 
Instead of encoding the first 4 letters of each seed word (which are unique in BIP39) they use the position of the seed words on the list of BIP39 words (in alphabetical order) to mark the plate.
I'm not sure about the price though, it seems a bit expensive especially considering their shipping prices even within Europe, but I've found the concept of using the word position in the list interesting because it can work with any language/alphabet (provided they use 4 digits for their numerals).
And when it comes to resiliency/durability it seems to be 304 stainless steel which seems equivalent to what the two other methods I've mentioned use.
EDIT: Oh and as a bonus is seems to be more compact than the alternatives, with 12 words per plate side.

The playing field of developers is precisely to make it accessible to people who aren't as qualified as them. They bear the responsibility of preserving the attributes of Bitcoin while making it usable by most people.
Their goal is actually to make it as transparent as possible when you use the protocol, so you don't have to understand it to use it. Just like many people use the Web without understanding TCP/IP, HTTP or even the concept of WWW aside from typing both of the latter when they enter a full URL. As an example of this simplification process, those parts of URL are often assumed when you enter a partial URL in a browser and most people have no idea what they mean.
The ideals of Bitcoin are essential for it to succeed, otherwise we'd just replicate what centralized systems currently do. But we don't require them to be known/understood by every single user of Bitcoin to make it useful for them.

And now you understand why many of us recommend to use hardware wallets in general. The whole process of signing transactions while protecting your private keys is streamlined so that you don't have to spend an afternoon setting this up each time you want to create a transaction.
All of this procedure is also only useful if you have setup your air-gapped computer correctly in the first place which in and of itself is already a task out of the reach of the majority of the potential users. People who argue that anyone is able to do it have never actually worked with novice/experimented users.

It's a financial institution, what did you expect? "Your" money is not your money once you give it to a third-party.
It cannot happen if you keep it in Bitcoin and not on a custodial service like Coinbase though, something to think about. Always try to figure out if the person/company you want to pay would accept Bitcoin for payment first.
If they don't, always withdraw larger fiat money sums progressively from exchanges over days/weeks/months, not all at once. If you have to do it very regularly you might still trigger the same procedures though at some point... and there's no way around this thanks to KYM/AML/bank compliance departments.
But hey, it could be even worse, it could mean your exchange is running out of fiat liquidity at the time which isn't a very healthy situation if they cannot fix it very quickly :S

It became a joke **to use this argument to support a contentious fork**. The deaths of babies are very real and not a joke. Not sure why you attempt to conflate these two distinct notions.
Until you prove that there is a direct causation between Bitcoin's block size limit and the deaths of babies this argument remains an appeal to pity, a clear fallacy, and I won't hesitate to mock anyone using it. I'd even argue that the real despicable person here is the one using the deaths of these babies to push such an agenda. There are plenty of proven advantages of Bitcoin over fiat, we don't need to use unproven and/or fallacious arguments.


It doesn't matter when this solution implies more centralization and the selling out of the most important aspect of Bitcoin which is being uncensorable. The people you want to help the most are the ones who actually **need** this feature, they are the one currently suffering oppression from governments/authorities and censorship. They are the one who should be able to afford running their own nodes and make sure they use the right chain for their transactions trustlessly.
In terms of bandwidth and processing power accessibility for these people raising the block size limit is inevitably implying their exclusion from the network or at best setting up more barriers to entry for them participate on the network. Is that what you want for them?


In no way is it currently limited to a custodial setting. I'm not sure why you seem to imply this.


Yeah, that's why we intend to keep it this way by not making it harder to participate in Bitcoin's network. Running a LN node can easily be done on the same hardware and Internet connection you're using for your Bitcoin node and developers are very mindful of the requirements their improvements imply for both LN and Bitcoin.


That's where you're mistaken, there are actors in this space who do not mind this. 100GB to 1TB blocks are the goal of many BCH/BSV supporters and this includes prominent developers in their communities. 
We're not talking far in the future, but as soon as their nodes in well connected, unmetered datacenters are able to propagate these quickly enough for "their" network, they are perfectly fine with users **having to** rely on SPV nodes and trust their data center nodes.
If you need a demonstration of how carelessly they increase this limit, look at the last BCH "stresstest", a fair share of the nodes were unable to stay synchronized when blocks reached ~22MB (out of the supposed 32MB limit) because they ran out of resources for processing/verifying this amount of transactions in a timely manner. The developers' answer was not to reduce the limit until it gets fixed to ensure the network security doesn't decreases as soon as their chain gets used, it was to keep the limit higher and hope to fix/optimize before their chain actually such a sees real usage. If you can't understand what it means in terms of centralization and how it betrays their attitude toward nodes with limited resources/connectivity I'm not sure I can help you understand.

Meanwhile in France it's illegal to transact for more than 1000€ in cash  (currently ~1100 USD)... and the initial law wanted to limit it at 500€.
Fight against it if you can, but as you said it's pretty much as lost cause. Bankers and governments share the power and want you to transact through them at all times so they can monitor/block you at their whim.
And obviously they won't block themselves when they commit crimes likes the one you've talked about, it's most likely even easier logistically for them to hide those crimes if it's in electronic money.

[Look at what happened when GHash exeeded 51% of the hash power on Bitcoin's network]( Miners moved to other pools and pools pledged to try avoiding this kind of situation in the future. Don't get me wrong, it is a problem and their solution isn't ideal. As you've pointed out there is work done to solve it (like BetterHash), but meanwhile we can observe that miners do take care of changing pool when alerted. Which implies that they aren't NPC's contrary to what you suggest.


Segwit2X was never actually mined (in any meaningful way at least, if I remember correctly there's a mining pool that respected their word and mined it but quickly stopped for obvious reasons).
Other miners gave up on the fork but not due to the off by one error (which could have been fixed if they had any intention to run it), they just did not dare losing the support and economic activity of the users who voiced their disagreement and threatened to fork on their own.
In both Segwit2X and the USAF you have two demonstrations of node owners not acting like NPC's and confronting another group of node owners. You're pretty much making my point.

Reminder that BCH's halving will likely happen at least 1 month before BTC's halving because they can't seem to manage their difficulty correctly (even with after tweaking their buggy EDA multiple times with hardforks).
Normally you shouldn't have to care about this shitcoin, but this fact means that for over a month BTC is going to be invariably more profitable for SHA256 miners. Which means that the BCH miners that work for economical reasons (if you understand Bitcoin's game theory it should mean most of them) are going to migrate to BTC for that period of time.
I let you imagine how secured and functional BCH will be in this context and what will be the attitude of BCH holders in this situation. Now try to figure out which coin they will turn to seeking refuge and the impact it will have on both their prices.
Hint: going back to fiat is almost a guaranteed taxable event for them if we're not talking about actual cash. Trading their BCH for BTC though can be done discreetly without much effort... provided they can find someone dumb enough to buy BCH at that time of course ;)

It's not a zero sum game, it's open source development. If they figure out anything useful Bitcoin can most likely use it too.
For now the only things they seem to have figured out though are:
* 0-conf isn't secure enough and they need "pre-consensus"/~~CTOR/~~Avalanche or in other words trust "random" groups of miners to timestamp things as they expect before they have even mined a block with those transactions.
* How blocks larger than ~20MB in a "stresstest" on their mainnet (out of their current 32MB limit) cause a significant part of their nodes to be unable to sync which leads to more centralization.
* That when almost nobody uses your coin it's *easy* to hardfork (it didn't take geniuses for this one... but still). Well that is until someone comes around and takes this opportunity to create their own version of the so-called "real Bitcoin" and attack the existing chain in a pretty effective manner. Which forced a single actor (Roger Ver, the same guy running bitcoin\.com ... how ironic isn't it?) to divert a lot of hash power to save BCH and pocket out the loss of profit to pay the miners that were forced to mine a less profitable chain. This just displayed how centralized the power is on this chain.
But to their credit one of their devs found a serious bug affecting Bitcoin, so as I said, it's not a zero sum game. They can be useful. In my book they can try whatever they want as long as they don't effectively run businesses using misleading names/tickers to sell their coin as "Bitcoin"... which bitcoin\.com attempted at some point too and got deserved backlash for it. It's almost like the same person is always involved the dirtiest plans, maybe that has something to do with this post ;D

Nice to see the company behind it participating here. Thanks for sharing some back story :)
Yeah I can imagine pricing is rough for smaller production batches. I was mostly discouraged by the shipping for Switzerland though. It's over half the price of the full kit... and I actually couldn't even test the effective shipping cost calculation at checkout as any real Swiss address I've entered didn't work.
If I could suggest two things:
* Add an option for a "minimum kit" with only the plates/encoder (and an optional punch maybe) that you could send in a bubble wrap envelopes to make the shipping costs minimal on those orders. The plates are thin and light, so is the encoder, it should really make a big difference in shipping costs.
* Offer a way to pay with Bitcoin, it really makes sense for your product. Preferably using your own [BTCPay Server]( instance if you want to keep the bitcoins in a non-custodial way. If you can't do it with BTCPay Server or want/need to convert to fiat automatically, at least please use ANYTHING ELSE than BitPay as your payment processor... they have the worst user experience for payments of all the processors (unjustified additional "network" fees, warning about slow payments even when they confirm in the next block for 1 sat/vbyte, they force the use of a non-standard BIP70 implementation, etc.).

You're right, I've edited my comment.


You're not supposed to be surprised, you're supposed to realize how bad it is in terms of decentralization to put up higher barriers to entry for participating on the network and excluding active participants.


I've only stated the following facts in this third point:
* It's easier to fork when almost nobody uses your currency (less people to convince to update, less existing infrastructure/software/wallets to update, less businesses depending on the existing chain, etc.)
* It's an open invitation for people with the will and necessary means to attempt to take over your currency through social and technical means.
* When it requires a single entity to spend more resources/money to defend it against such attacks, it demonstrates centralization of power.
There's nothing to "disagree" about those, it's just a description of reality and if you intend to deny facts I don't see how we're supposed to have a constructive discussion about it... If you actually provided an argument against those maybe, but you seem content with just disagreeing with them without justification.


It's not crying to call out bad faith actors that use deceit to further their agenda and profit with their businesses by misleading customers. That's the point of this OP if you haven't figured it out yet.


Your honest assessment consists of sitting on a fence even when you can witness the consequences of increasing blocksize right now. The same consequences that were clearly announced by "this sub and core", what you apparently deem as "propaganda" is actually happening before your eyes.
Now I fundamentally don't have any issue with your position, as I told you I don't see it as a zero sum game. But in your last sentence you seem to downplay/justify Roger's actions by pretending he's "just a guy". He's not "just a guy", he run a business that tries to deceive their customers, that's the definition of a scam. The fact that he flexed his power to demonstrate who actually runs Bitcoin Cash implies he can direct it where he wants, last time he decided to defend it, next time he might destroy it... if you're fine with that and storing funds on such a chain, do it, be his guest. But defending his actions isn't waiting to see how it unfolds, it's supporting him and his deceitful ways.

Never *buy* bitcoins on a platform that doesn't offer you a way to get your funds out of it in bitcoins. That's a very basic requirement, it doesn't ensure you that they'll have the liquidity to honor all of them (that pretty much only works on reputation, unless the platform has verifiable public audits). But at least you know they are actually trying to let you acquire bitcoins, not just claims for them in some centralized database record.

You're supposed to take note of the results of so-called "stresstests" and make your own conclusions. When it's done on your mainnet you should be concerned that 1. it could have been tested in on the testnet but nobody bothered to actually see if common hardware could sustain full blocks, and 2. that new attack vectors arose when it's became so easy to exclude a significant part of the network by just filling blocks.


A fact is a fact, he has done this, he has admitted to it and it's the only reason BCH is still how it is right now. Next time he might not make the choice that suits you, if you choose to **trust** him on this and leave your funds on such a chain, again, DO IT, by all means, I don't care. I'm only making those points to inform users why such threads exist about Roger Ver. They aren't gratuitous and the grievances I have against him are substantiated.


OK, so even in your warped reality, from your point of view, the majority agreed with those "attackers". Get over it, it's called consensus and it's how Bitcoin works, it's not a system in a vacuum and outside interference in how consensus is then formed when software is ran are part of the system, you don't get to redefine those rules on your own. It's been more than a year an a half now, move on. 


He can claim this wherever he wants aside from his registered business website, where he sells this to **customers**. How hard is this to understand for you?


No, one achieves something by preventing people from actually losing money to a deceitful seller. The other is bitching about moderation of a private forum which isn't ran by a business (unlike r\/btc actually where the owner and most of his moderators are employees of bitcoin\.com). You continue to downplay his actions which have actual legal repercussion if prosecuted, on the other side nobody gets condemned for moderating posts on subreddits... you might dislike it, but it's how reality works.


You can't set a limit, fail to propagate blocks under this limit without increasing drastically the centralization of your network and then pretend that everything was fine up until it failed so it's "successful". You're just arguing in bad faith now.
And Bitcoin is propagating larger blocks than Bitcoin Cash on a daily basis if you want to talk about small blocks, because it gets actually used, there's no point having a limit your can't actually reach without putting your whole network at risk. Too bad you can't seem to be able to grasp such a simple concept, it's quite essential to maintain the security of your network, maybe that's the reason why virtually nobody wants to transact on Bitcoin Cash after all this time.


No that's the legal point of view. You don't need to lie and use misleading/wrong denominations for products on purpose in your store to sell them, it's as simple as that.


The state of LN has absolutely no bearing on what a majority of the people consider to be Bitcoin currently, it's determined by a lot of factors... it's also not defined by just your opinion or mine. There's a form of social agreement users, businesses, exchanges reach for put a name on currencies and attribute tickers to them, it's not the role of any of them to rename one by the name of an EXISTING currency... this is essentially misleading, if you can't comprehend this I can't help you.


I couldn't care less what they do as long as they don't try to use their businesses to scam people as directly and dishonestly as Roger Ver has. I'm also not threatened by the so-called censorship of a private forums, if your favorite altcoin (considering how you suddenly defend BCH... for someone supposedly neutral it's kinda odd honestly) is threatened by moderation maybe it's time to ask yourself if you're really dealing with uncensorable money.

You're quite optimistic if you think a state will order the compensation in BTC.

You can talk about inflation because that's the definition of this word, the available supply of Bitcoin that can be used in the economy is inflated every time new coins are mined.

What kind of work? It's working how it is supposed to be. Users have to be careful about the state they broadcast on the network, it's by design.
It's like saying the Bitcoin protocol needs work since users are losing Bitcoins on a daily basis when they make mistakes handling their private keys. It's not true, it's the responsibility of users to participate in a way that will not punish them, that is how they are kept "honest".

You do not buy "Lightning Network" (LN) and neither does it have its own currency.
The LN uses bitcoins as its currency and the Bitcoin protocol as a base for settlement. So you buy bitcoins on any exchange (or your acquire them through work/selling goods/etc.) and you allocate them on the Lightning Network by putting them in a wallet supporting the LN.
As a brief technical overview, this action will usually open one or more channels on LN with other peers of this network which enables you to transact on LN. Each peer (LN node) is able to route transactions with other peers which makes it possible for you to transact with peers that are not directly connected to you.
It's also important to note that at no point you ever trust other peers with your money, the channel(s) your wallet opens are only a contract between you and a counter party that ensure you all control the funds you pretend to have. The transactions on LN are off-chain transactions (not recorded on Bitcoin's blockchain), LN nodes only exchange valid Bitcoin transactions which are not yet broadcasted and mined, only the channel opening and closing transactions will be mined and incur fees on the Bitcoin network, all the LN transactions in between are either free or very cheap as they do not require mining. Mechanisms are in place to punish (and soon prevent with *eltoo*) users for misbehaving, for example if they try to broadcast an old transaction/state in their favor to try to get back money they have spent and you notice it and close this channel you will get back the funds from this channel.

I agree with the points you've made and I was pondering about this from a strictly pragmatic point of view, even if they were willing to force people to stop this "waste", I don't see how they would enforce it globally. If they can't do it globally they will just hinder their own economy.

Now let's just use ad hominems to seal the deal. You're definitely not willing to have a discussion in good faith. And again, as you said it yourself, "it says it all".


It's funny because you don't know what I use or even what my IT experience is but you assume that since I advocate for common users to use hardware wallets instead of trying to attempt (and most likely fail) creating their own airgapped system I must be using hardware wallets exclusively myself... way to completely miss the point. That's unfortunately what happens when you put bad faith in a discussion like you do.
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:23:32


You can connect one on an online computer but your private keys never leave the hardware wallet.
The main purpose of hardware wallets is to be able to generate your keys in an airgapped environment and then segregate the creation and signing of transaction on the device. The only sensitive elements that travel over USB wire are encrypted with your private keys. You can attempt to do this process on your own with your own hardware/software mix but it's complex and prone to errors (which can end up in you leaking private keys)... that's what hardware wallets attempt to solve.
If you're persuaded that you can maintain the same level of security than their streamlined process with your own solution and it's cheaper, by all means, do it... but advising to everyone else that it's an easy/cheap task is not responsible. Just because it can end up to be cheaper financially than buying an hardware wallet it doesn't mean it was cheap to acquire the necessary knowledge to maintain the same level of security... and you discount the quantity of errors you can do if you actually use your funds and need to create and sign transactions.


You are at the same mercy for any solutions you can come up with on your own... unless you generate everything without using any compute (have fun with that). One of the differences though is that hardware wallets are specialized hardware and if this use case is ruined because they fucked up their whole business is gone... which is a great incentive to not fuck up. If your USB storage keys provider gets outed for people losing Bitcoins when they stored it on their product, their business won't be affected because there are many other use cases.


Sure, you're also unable to use your cryptocurrency without complex operations to create and transfer signed transactions. You're describing the perfect solution for pure cold storage, hardware wallets have other uses that you can choose to take advantage of or not... if you never connect them to anything either they are similar to an always airgapped system.

What makes you say that Warcraft Gold isn't taxable currently exactly?
Reading [IRS's notice about "virtual currencies"]( I wouldn't be so sure it's not taxable... but I'm not a US tax expert and I might read too much into it.
Just know that as a general rule, no matter the country, the absence of tax collection on something is not always due to it not being taxable. It might be taxable but rarely reported, hard to verify, a very low source of tax collection in which cases authorities might not bother trying to collect it until it reaches a profitable "mass" for them.

They are not "needed" if you run a LN node and make sure you don't go offline for extensive periods of time (depending on the period set when opening your channel).

While I agree with the principle, as long as the use of bitcoins as a currency is a taxable event for the customers those 3-5% don't really compensate the administrative (bookkeeping) and financial (additional revenue taxes) burden it causes... 
Unfortunately there isn't  much work done by anyone to solve this because these "taxes" profit the same people who are in charge of potentially changing them. Removing them is not realistic as they are a source of revenue and control for governments, but I wish there was a way to at least simplify those transactions... without that I'm held back from spending bitcoins unless it is a big transaction (more than few USD worth).

Leaving a false premise govern the discussion makes any discussion impossible.

*Some* coins currently rely on SPV for their scaling "solution" to be worth anything. It can explain why they are prone to be content with arguments like "it works in most scenarios" or "with enough full nodes the trust is diluted enough". 
Unfortunately those arguments fall short when there's an actual attack on the network targeting nodes used by SPV clients, it can be just a geographically targeted attack (organized by a government with full control over their network) to censor or lie to SPV clients.
The fact that originally SPV was supposed to have an alert system in place as mentioned in the whitepaper and that nobody ever managed to build a trustless one should be a sufficient indication that in its current form SPV is just "good enough" for very limited applications (small-medium payments) and shouldn't be the main support of your scaling solution.

That's a plausible theory, unfortunately it would be pretty hard to prove it. It could also have been an attack on Bitcoin (lots of low cost transactions that someone who has a lot of hashpower is almost sure to recoup fees from as a miner  to stress the fee market and *bank* on the predicament to sell an altcoin with lower fees... because it's unused and/or centralized), which is also hard to prove.
Anways, anything that can offload transactions from Bitcoin's chain for users who already do not care about the actual ownership of their bitcoins (their funds would be on custodial services anyways to be able to take advantage of time sensitive trading opportunities) is great as long as nobody is forced to use it. Users should always be able to make these choices for their funds. And if Bitcoin was threatened by the existence of such services it would mean it failed at being permissionless, which would be a much bigger problem.

It does few things Bitcoin can't do well currently:
* Instantaneous transactions
* Micro/nano transactions down to 1 **milli**satoshi
* Negligible fee
* Atomic swaps
For transactions that you don't think deserve/need to be stored on chain forever, like the usual "buying coffee" example, it's perfectly suitable as long as you still have access to the first layer when you want/need it (and you do, otherwise you cannot open/close channels).

Your airgapped system can be tampered with too... what's your point?
Again it depends on your usage, if you don't intend to connect your hardware wallet to anything and never use your keys, it's as good as your airgapped solution. And if your usage demands to create and sign transactions, the streamlined process of doing it on hardware wallets is less likely to result in errors than doing all the necessary steps manually (involving even more software/hardware components to transfer your signed transaction around the airgap).

Check the public keys with a non zero balances in your wallet, if they start with "3" (P2SH-P2WPKH) or "bc1" (bech32), you are using Segwit addresses.
P2SH-P2WPKH addresses are compatible with Segwit and widely supported currently, bech32 addresses are native Segwit addresses and their support by services/applications is not as good currently unfortunately. For example Coinbase does not support sending Bitcoins to bech32 addresses yet, it's a limitation on their side though, the protocol itself supports them completely.

Where did I deny this exactly? Feel free to quote me. I said it was a set of circumstances that led to it instead of just adoption/attention as Aztiel suggested. The fact that they used a peak value for fees as an argument led me to look at their history and it didn't miss, they are a regular troll.
Also, what exactly is "the greed of fees" you're talking about? In Bitcoin's case fees serve as a free market regulation tool to allocate space on the blockchain. Users decide of the fees for their transactions. Users who want the space first have to pay more for it when there is high demand, if they can wait they will eventually get in for very low fees. Further more Bitcoin was not created to address the disparity in the repartition of capital. If you were sold this as an economical goal of Bitcoin I think you've been misled.
With this in mind, how does fees in the banking system OP used achieve anything aside from filling banker's pockets? Do you figure the real cost of securing a $3.55 transaction is really $15?
I don't defend OP's ridiculous transaction, it's just a good demonstration of how bad this system can be.

If you are actually concerned by this you should find a metric that include currencies which are effectively comparable. Remove all cryptocurrencies that are pre-mined, inflationist and fundamentally centralized, remove all the coins that clearly have not brought any innovation in the field and which do not have more than a whitepaper or a vague roadmap/website, remove all the coins which are clearly existing as proof of concepts without scale in mind... then it might gain some relevance.
Or if your stance is that all coins are created equal and can be compared, just start including fiat currencies in there to see how actually irrelevant this statistic is ;)

You are right, I was talking about Litecoin and Bitcoin related to fiat when I said "ATH". Fiat is the "way out" for most "investors" and because Litecoin (unlike many altcoins) can be sold without using BTC the comparison with fiat seems appropriate to me.

I'm wondering, if you do trust your phone manufacturer to encrypt your data (as recommended by Andreas Antonopoulos on few occasions if I remember correctly), why would you doubt about their honesty/ability when it comes to an encrypted keystore?
I don't say it would be wise to keep more BTC than you'd be willing to lose on an online device like this anyways, but for the users who are not using encrypted data storage on their device, I'd say an encrypted keystore isn't that bad of an idea. It being open-source would be even better but I doubt Samsung would ever do this.

It is a payment processing platform, it handles the creation, management, tracking of payments. Invoices are created from your e-commerce solution, a Bitcoin address is assigned for each invoice and the platform can signal to your e-commerce solution when the payment has been done or if it failed.

Your new bank (Bitcoin) isn't as lenient as your former banks when it comes to give you access to your money for security reasons. It's a feature. It's not your home insurance's business to cover the risk this creates, they cover tangible objects that you own and store in your home/around it.
A solution would be to have multiple backups of your seed in secured locations (offline), preferably geographically distant of each others. Having one or more additional seed words to secure them in this scenario and not store them together is a good idea too.
I honestly don't think there will ever be insurances that will cover the value linked to private keys like this, it's too easy to generate keys and move around funds without ever giving out your identity, how would you prove that they were lost/destroyed/robbed?
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:12:04
My point was that it was just a temporary state, a time during which we can't use our currency as we please, but the underlying projects (Bitcoin and Litecoin) are not ending, they can't "bankrupt", they aren't stocks. If they "stop" working we would not be looking at a value decreasing like we're seeing right now, it would be worth 0.0. I don't really see any scenario in which this could happen right now, given the censorship resistance of both projects, but who knows.
And this is a given with both projects while they are young/marginally adopted, you can't expect to use your money all the time for various reasons: technical difficulties (causing high fees for example), value temporarily decreasing (for any reason really), etc. It's not like it should be a surprise for anybody, it has happened in the past, and it will happen again until price discovery for the whole market stabilizes... the issue is that this market changes so much every day that this price discovery might take few more years, that's what's the most atypical with cryptocurrencies compared to traditional markets. People who might get hurt in the process are hurt because they are not informed well enough about this and just act as they would on any market. You can try to warn them, lots of them won't listen during a bull run, even less of them will listen in a "crash"... human nature is really too predictable when facing losses. The people who profit from this are the ones applying the chart technical analysis from traditional markets, the trends are amplified with the volatility and so are their profits. Honestly it's sad, but it's how it works, cryptocurrencies won't change this and they can't succeed without going through this phase.

It should tend to this ideal for sure, but unfortunately so-called idiots rely on others to handle complicated things for them (in other words: trust third parties) and if the base protocol of Bitcoin has to cater to them then it would not be a trustless system anymore.
So if something like this has to exist it should not be a dependency of Bitcoin. Right now exchanges play this role and unsurprisingly we cannot say it is a success (hacks, stolen funds, pressure from banks, etc.)... even if some of them are quite "idiot-proof".
If you have an actual idea on how to change Bitcoin in a way that it can become *idiot proof* without trusting third parties you should really share it on the Bitcoin dev mailing list ;)

You are missing the fact that you are not supposed to open a channel for just 1 off-chain transaction, the amount you commit to a channel can and most likely should be used in multiple occasions with different people/businesses. Opening multiple channels with different nodes will mean that you will be more accessible and you will have access to more routes. If everyone does this you obtain a very meshed network with a lot of potential routes. If I any point you want to reclaim your coins you can just close the channel(s) and this way you settle all the off-chain transactions that were signed by the involved parties.
An ideal Lightning Network wallet should do all of this behind the scene, while you would just commit a certain amount that you plan to use as a currency, just like you would with a checking account at a bank, but you don't have to trust many banks to send and receive money,  you don't even have to trust the LN nodes you connect to, they only know the next hop to which they transmit your transaction and they cannot know if the node that sent it was the original issuer of the transaction and if the next one is the last one (onion routing).
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:24:31
Here are [some good reasons to run a full node](


This is mostly an argument from people who mine Bitcoin, they cannot see the value of non-mining full nodes as for them they only play a role in adding more hops before transactions are relayed to them and it can prevent them from mining more efficiently. From their point of view it's a waste of resource and it's understandable, nobody enjoys supervision/checks unfortunately in a truely decentralized system nodes that do not have the same incentives as them is a great addition, they are way less susceptible to collusion, especially in situation where miners are concentrated in a specific area (China for example). Just to be clear, before miners here jump at my throat, this collusion is not necessarily their fault, they can be forced to act this way by a third party (government for example).

I agree with you and the whole point I'm making is that Bitcoin does not care if it's spam or not, if it's hostile or not. And it shouldn't care, otherwise we'd have to start making decisions about what is legitimate or not and this would be a step in the direction of censorship.
The consensus rules on transactions validity are and hopefully will always be neutral in this regard. If people want to waste their money, let them, Bitcoin is way too resilient for any of them having a long term impact. Spending our time improving it to ingest this kind of attacks with even less impact is more profitable than trying to find out who they are and why they do it.

I do not condone spam, but the fee market in place makes sure that only transactions someone is willing to pay for at market price are be mined.
I hate this word, but it makes the spam transactions as "legitimate" as the other transactions. We do not need a form of protection against this because the ones who do this are wasting money and the whole point of Bitcoin is to let people use money as they please.
Even if they mine these transactions themselves they waste computing resources which costs them money. And even more money when you figure out they'd have earned money by mining actual transactions instead of spending money to generate spam.
So chances are, yeah, some spam was generated for a short period of time (1-2 months). But it actually put the fee market to the test and proved that this kind of "attack" cannot be sustained long enough to damage the system on the long term. Even with large pockets full of money, they don't win when they go against game theory principles.

Do not think about what's good for the network, think about what's good for you. 
1. Consider the number of input/outputs you'd have to use to actually move your coins and see how much it would cost now versus how much it would cost at a time when fees are considered high. [Here's a decent too do this]( 
2. Make a decision based on this difference and factor in the probability of you really **having** to move these coins at the worst time.
I see it as a kind of insurance, the few cents I've paid to consolidate many addresses might spare me money in the future, or not... but currently I can afford them and they can only preserve or increase the situation for me in the worst case scenario when it comes to fees.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:13:31
I'd be willing to hear some of those "thousand things" that are actually Bitcoin issues rather than Bitcoin's price related issues...
Price is an interesting aspect of Bitcoin, but it's not the factor that decided me to be involved in this market few years ago. The disruptive nature of the technology on political and financial levels are what made me interested, sure when it gained value lately I was smiling and now that it has lost some of these gains I smile less, but the underlying concepts of this project aren't going away... And we have to deal with speculation just like any new and scarce asset has to, it implies volatility and while on the surface it looks like people will lose confidence because they only look at the price, there will come a time when they'll notice the utility of this (just like it took years for people to see the utility of Internet... it took major developments in terms of hardware and software to accomplish this feat). The unchangeable nature of gold and its limited use cases makes it a rather weak competitor, credit/debit cards provider would have to completely flip the way they are currently making money to survive something like Lightning Network when it reaches their scale... so to me it is only a matter of time.
Maybe I'm too optimistic, and I won't live long enough to see this happen, but the main factor that helps me think this way is that I'm not over exposed and I have alternatives in life, judging by how a lot of people react on forums/social media it seem that I must be in a minority unfortunately... and this somewhat explains the recent correction.

I feel like I'm a parrot these days, but let them waste their money and resources, they are not infinite. 
Even in the context of "altcoin millionaires" that you describe, the system will it get out of breath. For these people to become actual millionaires they still need a lot of fiat injected in their shitcoin (directly for certain coins which have fiat pairs, indirectly and often through BTC/ETH for the others) and while fiat can be printed at will it is done at a relatively fixed rate that they do not control.
People who get burnt out spamming the network with little to no effect on the long term are less likely to come back and try it again, it's a great way to weed out these people. Make them fund their own exit through the fee market, that's game theory based spam protection. And if Bitcoin ever fails because of that it would be a shame, but it would prove that it isn't resilient enough for what we need. For now it has consistently proven the opposite on many occasions.

Can you point me where they have been transparent about the negotiation of your "sponsorship" with their contributors? Or even just an announcement that there would be a sponsorship soon and promote an healthy discussion about it? All I have seen for "transaprency" is the owners posting a Pull Request, mostly ignoring the disagreement from major contributors, committing the related code with only minor tweaks and publishing the changes really quickly. [This can all be witnessed in the Pull Request](
I have nothing against your company and only named it to give context to my complaint. My problem is that a website claimed to be for educational purpose, a nice community of contributors grew based on this premise and managed to keep the site alive and useful, but suddenly and unilaterally the owners decided to turn it into a commercial website without prior discussion with their community... this isn't "transparent" and it isn't how usually FOSS projects treat their contributors.
Thanks for your contributions to this space and charitable endeavors, again this post is by no means an attempt to make you look bad, the owners of bitcoin.org are the ones who acted in a bad way when they forced this on their visitors and disregarded the opinions of their contributors.

And yet miners didn't push through with their plans (S2X) and gave users what they wanted. Most likely because they were reminded that without users, their mining make little to no sense financially in the long run.
So when you say it didn't change "anything", you're discarding the social impact user mobilization had, if it has to be demonstrated through an UASF initiative and users were ready to risk the value of their currency by ending up in a minority chain I would say that it changes something.

bitcoin.org is most likely one of the first website new users visit when they seek information about Bitcoin. Until now the list of businesses allowing them to acquire bitcoins was relatively impartial and the entries in the list of exchanges were vetted by the community according to standards most of them agreed upon. This new "sponsor" was able to go over that process by paying and they also negotiated a spot above every other listed ways to acquire bitcoins.
I'm fully aware that the owners of the website are free to do this and I do not call for them to change it. It is their website even if volunteers help them a lot for content.
I'm merely making people aware of the new turn this website has taken and wondering if this website is still fit to educate new users as impartially as it did in the past. Few of the regular contributors also seem to disagree with this move and already declared that they would not keep helping them. It's quite unfortunate that a project that tried to educate new users is now also trying to sell those users to their new advertiser (sponsor).

Cobra outlines few ideas on how this money could be spent, which honestly is a secondary concern to most of the other contributors, they are more concerned by the fact that the options to acquire Bitcoin are not presented as impartially before.
To be honest the site already had some politically motivated limitations to what was listed, but as far as I know it was never done with commercial motivation (i.e. they removed certain businesses/exchanges that supported S2X in the past), they never tried to favor one particular business in exchange of a "sponsorship"...

Thanks for your feedback.
I'm sorry to hear that your company got some trouble supposedly from this, on the other hand you got linked on the first site that comes up when people search Bitcoin and you became the first clickable option when people click "Buy" so it was inevitably going to drain some attention onto you ;)
Your efforts in the space are commendable and it was never a critique of businesses trying to promote themselves, my main problem was the way the owners of the site treated their contributors in the process. In my experience they always are very careful about what gets published and I've seen contributions delayed for weeks/months until they were perfect (which is great) and suddenly when money is at stake they push this Pull Request in few days, ignored comments/concerns from pillars of the community and published these changes.
When you put your time into something for free and you get rewarded this way it's a bit disappointing, especially when the changes do affect the image of the site. Before this the website was widely considered as a very neutral source of information about Bitcoin, without financial motivations. In terms of UX, visitors have no idea about the details of this sponsorship, even with the detailed page about it, the first thing they are going to see when they try to buy bitcoins is a prominent link to one company, this inevitably will change their view about the source of information... and when you are recommending educational content to someone if there is this kind of advertisement on the site they might think that you are getting a share of the benefits which also undermines your recommendation if you don't make it clear you do not.
Lastly, when it comes to the money and how it will be used, I said it before and I'll say it again, I'm inclined to trust to do good things with it. The point of this post was never to instill doubt about this.

Not liking doesn't mean you have to act on it... The "meh" is more about "I can't do much about it, it will come back up, fundamentals are still present". It's not like you selling it will change the trend (unless we're talking thousands of BTC at the time). Actually it will make it worse if everyone hodling changed their mind right now.

Most forks aren't really that financially interesting unless you held a lot of bitcoins. Anyways, you should be careful about the software (wallets) you have to install to claim these funds on the forks. Unless you know what you are doing it can be a risky operation. In any case you should always have moved your actual bitcoins to new addresses before trying to claim these addresses on another fork, at least if they are stolen your BTC will not be at risk that way :)

* Informing the rest of the Bitcoin community about the situation (this thread and similar posts were made by other people interested in this issue last few days).
* Stopping my contributions to this site until they restore the previous content quality standard (i.e. as neutral and non-commercial as possible) and hopefully be followed by other contributors.
* Not recommending this site to new users to get information. Hence my meta question in my initial comment here but unfortunately I don't think the topic got popular enough to warrant reactions from moderators/owners of this sub. I might message them directly about it.
One thing that I want to make clear is that there is no need to throw the baby with the bath water, as I said previously the owner can change their mind about this issue, make this sponsored content much more neutral or renegotiate the terms of the sponsorship to please the community... but for the moment they were much quicker to change the website than to answer to their contributors' concern unfortunately.

The moment they do this they will also lose a good share of their hashpower because people will bail from their pools. This is so true that usually pools owners themselves are wary of reaching stage where *their* miners can *suspect* that the pool is in position where they can effectively attack the network. For example ghash.io committed to reducing their share of the hashpower when they were nearing 50% of the total hashpower of Bitcoin in the past. Miners also claimed to voluntarily move to another pool in such situations. Obviously Bitmain could also have a majority of the hashrate of all these pools combined, in which case an emergency hardfork will most likely be the next move... the important part as you suggest is that they are not in a position to destroy the network completely.
In any case, starting these kind of attacks will also void any trust they have established with their customers for their hardware/services and for the pools they used. It would certainly mean the end of their business too, justifying this to your shareholders is a bit tricky... Obviously they could be under duress by their government when they do this, but the fate of the company would be the same in the end...and Bitcoin would still survive it. Obviously it would put a serious dent in the price and confidence of people supporting Bitcoin... but resilience is rarely free.

This is very unfortunate. I've been following this discussion and I did not think they would go through with it... but they did.
I have contributed to their project in the past (minor contributions) and this is clearly a deal-breaker for me, I won't help them anymore. I understand that they are trying to raise funds to make the site better, but clearly from the lack of transparency about who/where/how funds are actually allocated to the site and their backroom negotiation of this deal, bitcoin . org is taking a very commercial turn. Their "public service" side has taken a serious hit in my opinion and it's sad.
One thing that made it worse is that they basically just showed up with a Pull Request once the deal was done/almost done without prior discussion about this deal. It shows a clear lack of respect for the opinion of their contributors. To be completely fair to the owners, they did take some remarks into consideration but the general commercial aspect of this "sponsorship" (as they call it) has not budged one bit and clearly most visitors will be lured to this "sponsor" for their first Bitcoin purchases when they should be invited to make an educated choice based on impartial information instead... as was the usual principle on the site before this.
@_date: 2018-07-19 00:10:09


Boycotts are rarely effective and I do believe you're free to do anything you want with the domain/website you own. And hopefully I'm free to inform users on this change and encourage a discussion about them.


That's a loaded question. I want new comers to be informed in a rather neutral manner, where they can make educated choices based on possibly unbiased information. There were sound propositions in the PR to achieve this while accommodating this sponsorship but it seems that the details of the deal with Paxful were not compatible with those and the changes were committed/published with only some minimal tweaks.


I'm sure it could, but how is this relevant here? Calling for volunteers to do SEO, incentivizing them with bounties, using the donations you receive to finance professional SEO sevices... all of those seem like better alternatives than forcing a sponsorship with terms that do not satisfy many of *your* contributors.


I don't think I've said it was malicious, I'm only pointing out the new kind of content put forward by your website, people can judge it for themselves. If you had been much more transparent (before making such a deal) and had respected the collective efforts the contributors put in the content of your site to establish a framework within which such a sponsorship could have been integrated without as much contention you would not be dealing with this negativity.
Anyways, the changes have been done and your site will have to live with that compromise now. You can always improve/change it too... and all I'm asking for is an open discussion on the merits of your website as a gateway for new comers who will click links in the sidebar.

I accepted that before buying Bitcoin few years ago. For me the "it can only go up" attitude is related to functionalities and use cases, price increases are awesome and should naturally follow, but people who think it can do so without volatility are insane... we're dealing with a relatively new intrinsically scarce resource, swings are part of the contract, you can expect a whole market to be "reasonable" all the time.

Coinbase requires identity verification for Bitcoin purchases with fiat money and also when you withdraw large amounts of fiat. OP also linked their checking account to their Coinbase account.
So OP's identity is known by Coinbase and if OP was to take advantage of an error from Coinbase they will most likely hold him accountable for it and just correct it on OP's account, like any financial institution would do.
I am not a lawyer, but if there aren't sufficient funds when the correction happens they might very well sue OP and ask him for interests/damages and might even push for criminal charges as it could very well been interpreted as a theft attempt if OP had no reasons to believe the money was theirs at the time of withdrawal.

There's no such thing as "lightning coins", they are bitcoins for which you own private keys, otherwise you're not able to sign transactions to spend them on LN and you can't close the LN channel(s) either.
If you decide to not control your private keys and use another layer that is custodial over LN (an exchange in your example) it does not change LN's way to operate for everyone else, just for you... like you do when you use exchanges to hold your bitcoins right now.

It is a lot of money to run such a site, even on its own dedicated server with decent DDoS (so-called) protection, unmetered traffic, redundancy (through a CDN for example), etc... you'd be able to host a similar site for much less than $1,000 a month (and I'm ample). Obviously you can choose more costly providers and I don't think there is a transparent list, hosts it as far as I know he'd be able to disclose this information, I'm just estimating from my experience in the field.
The content itself does evolve a lot and is mostly maintained by volunteers which aren't numerous either, which is why they *recently* started using a bounty program to incentivize contributions. But as Cobra pointed out there are ways to spend this money effectively... and this "sponsorship" might not last forever either.


The "sponsored" tag had to be requested by the other contributors,  [the original design did not have it]( Anyhow and I also think it's a great thing, but the fact that this purchasing method comes before any other is a bit much. Paxful could easily be listed as other exchanges (if they comply with the criteria the site had up until now), maybe at the top at worse and still with a tag... that's how a "sponsorship" is supposed to work in my opinion, otherwise it turns into plain and simple advertising and an endorsement from the website.

I have not. I have told you from the start that it is a wallet with more features... which makes it a platform for payments.


It's the documentation, it's complete and informative enough to answer the questions you've asked.




To be honest, your level of entitlement and arrogance is quite annoying. Nobody owes you an explanation for this, simple or complicated. Your interest in this is so limited that you could not take the time to read the first item of the feature list and went on claiming that "BTCPay is literally an intermediary." wrongfully. Then you pretended that you knew the difference all along when you were proven wrong... and now you pretend that you don't know what BTCPay is/does. So yes, this looks like trolling and if it's not, you're lacking the basic social and cognitive skills necessary to learn, so I'm done talking with you as I don't want to waste more time doing this. Have a nice evening.

The owners of the site did not give contributors a chance to be open-minded, when we finally had an occasion to give our opinion it was disregarded by the owners and they only cared about publishing the changes to the website as soon as possible (supposedly because it was the terms of the contract with their "sponsor").


Sure, if they do lose enough contributors over this I'm sure they will be able to buy some with all the money from "sponsors"... This somewhat kills the neutral and community fueled aspect of the website don't your think? That's what I liked about bitcoin . org personally and unfortunately it seems that this is a very secondary goal for its owners now, it's a shame that they had to use volunteers' work to get to this point... and when they reach it they do not care about these people's opinion.

It is and when a website which usually did not do it suddenly change their stance on this I think it's worth reevaluating their contribution to the space when it comes to educational resources. At least make their new objectives clear to everyone. I acknowledge that they still have a lot of useful content and they do make it clear this is basically an ad, I still feel that such a change should be discussed here since the website is linked in the sidebar.


I don't think I'm being hypocritical here, firstly because I don't concentrate on Bitcoin's price very much and the people who actually maintain the content of the website were consulted at the last minute (after the deal was made and without prior discussion) by the owners and their disapproval was mostly ignored. Those acts have consequences and the owners might be ready to take them for the revenue this sponsor provides.  They are well within their rights to do it, but making it known to Bitcoin's community at large sounded appropriate, which is why I've posted it.

This change was committed/published is after owners of the site presented [this Pull Request]( out of the blue (without talking about this deal to the community before making it) and a lot of contributors voiced that they did not want those changes to happen this way.
Unfortunately this clearly gives bitcoin.org a new much more "commercial" taste that makes me uncomfortable. I don't think I will recommend the site anymore to new users and I will guide them to resources such as the [Bitcoin Wiki]( and [Jameson Lopp's website]( for example which will help them to make up their mind on if/where they should acquire Bitcoin much more impartially.

And so do users and miners, they have shown this by not switching to some random altcoins which made compromises in terms of censorship-resistance just to be able to say "look we have low fees". There is more value in Bitcoin than a low-fee payment system, but you don't seem to get it.

Segwit did not "force" them to upgrade. To this day they can still use their older clients and carry on business as they did in the past. They would just lose on opportunities that Segwit offers and potentially lose customers who do adopt Segwit.

Could you explain the relevance of this metric considering the shortcomings you agree with?
I'll add one, the fact that the base of it is marketcap, which once a coin is listed, is relatively easily manipulable for a shitcoin (supply being a feature that shitcoins have no problem increasing all the time).
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:08:17


It isn't. The list of currencies you use is most likely arbitrary (I suppose it's CoinMarketCap like almost every post of this kind), the features of the currencies on this list are way too heterogeneous and the way to measure success of a coin cannot be summarized by it's marketcap because it's an easily inflatable metric in this space.

Are you arguing that until everyone (you'll have to define the limit here :P) is donating on a regular basis to a mostly non-profit/community based website, it's not enough?
You can host a website like bitcoin . org easily for a decade right now with those donations if nobody were to ever donate again. And since bitcoin . org had a mostly impeccable reputation up until now they would surely have kept getting donations. If they did not they could have reached to their community to get funds and most likely to also. If they ever were in a situation where its existence was imperiled, that's really not an issue here. And by experience with other open source projects that's generally how they hold together when their intention isn't to become a for-profit business.


Most likely the same that will happen when this so-called sponsorship ends, so I'm not sure what's your point here is.


You know it's not possible to answer this, but Paxful isn't going to keep "sponsoring" bitcoin . org either if they do not get a ROI (which is why it's hard to call it a sponsorship). Their intentions are made clear because they had a tracking tag added on the links pointing to Paxful's website (another commit that was done against the opinion of other contributors). An actual sponsor would be content with the positive image they gain from a reputable source such as bitcoin . org, an advertiser on the other hand requires this kind of tracking to determine if their campaign is profitable. An actual sponsor could easily track this using the HTTP referrer header to see if it brought them traffic or not... it's way less reliable but also much better in terms of privacy (you can opt-out of it).
So both donations and sponsorships are uncertain sources of revenue. But now that it has been made clear by the owners that the community aspect of the site is very secondary to them (by ignoring their disagreement), I do not think their community will keep contributing as much and this is a pretty good way to ensure that less people will donate to them. These donations were the fruits of the community efforts to bring neutral and non-commercially motivated information to the visitors.
In the end, and sorry if I'm repeating myself, making money is not the issue it's how it's made and how it affects the visitors seeking for educational content.


Well, it's not the case of the community (me included) that worked and helped this website until now. It is obvious that there will always be people who do not care to help and will still complain, but debating about them won't solve the issues at hand and most likely won't convince them to help either... so sure, screw those people who ever they are... and now what?

[More than 10 BTC in total]( were donated recently to the site owners. This should help with server/bandwidth costs don't you think?


I've personally contributed to this site's content and code. I was doing what I could to help. Up until now, the site has always been a collaborative effort to educate users and with these changes it took another turn.
The issue is not that they are trying to make money (I would even be inclined to trust that this money will benefit the website and Bitcoin education in general), it's that they have changed the way the site fundamentally communicates with its visitors. There is a commercial discourse coming before the actual educational content/information. They also pushed these changes despite many of their major contributors have voiced their disagreement. When a site depends heavily on volunteer contributors for its content it's a rather disrespectful way to treat them.

There is no "day 1 of implementation", it is already on mainnet despite all node applications still being at alpha stage and they are still under active development/tests on testnet too.
Nonetheless there are few hundreds LN nodes on mainnet and about 6 BTC in total in channels [at the moment](
The fees "structure" depends on the nodes, anyone running a node can set a fee for the transactions they facilitate but the other incentive of running a node is to be able to use the LN. So it's completely possible that many nodes will not ask for fees at all. Accepting fees might also cause "lambda" users trouble with their governments if they do not declare them as revenue... this area is really grey as most laws written about this relate to actual banks/financial institutions, but it is a whole other debate and LN will not wait on regulations to take place to be used, just like Bitcoin.
I have no idea where the 30% tx fail rate figure comes from, from what I've read for now I haven't seen people claiming they had lost actual money on mainnet.
Finally, it should not cause another fork yet. Segwit was necessary for it to be able to run on Bitcoin's network. Segwit was activated as a softfork which is much different from a hardfork (such as the one that gave birth to BCH). Hardforks of Bitcoin are very probable in the future if there is consensus to change core features of the protocol and as long as they do not become contentious hardforks it is part of the planned lifecycle of Bitcoin so it's not really something to be afraid of.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:18:36
It didn't ruin anything, it proved that Bitcoin is resilient to contentious hardforks, it was followed by other hardforks and all of them are pretty much dead in terms of usage and hashrate.

I wonder where he got the idea there was no consensus... although there was supposedly about 90% of the hashrate supporting S2X... I only see the UASF, do you see another reason why they'd take this decision and miners didn't try to still go through with S2X with another developer?
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:25:38
It should also be noted that the coin you created, let's call it Ripple2.0 for no real reason, might not share any of the fundamental features Bitcoin has (open, public, permissionless, decentralized, not pre-mined, etc.)... and yet your new coin would still "eat" some of Bitcoin's "dominance" because they are put in the same very large bag labeled "cryptocurrencies". On both your premises and this it really is the most useless metric in this space.
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:49:24
Even if it wasn't in the context of censorship, if you can avoid intermediaries/rent seekers for less than the fee they bill you, I still don't understand why you wouldn't do it... aside maybe from laziness/ignorance.
You can run a BTCPay Server and the related nodes (Bitcoin/LN) for few dollars a months, if your business/use case can't afford this you also generally don't need the complexity of such system (accounting, billing, etc.) and you can handle payments manually by issuing new Bitcoin addresses for each order or at worse reuse the same address (knowingly reducing your and your customer's privacy).

It's almost as if this metric doesn't mean much, no matter the website which computes it.

Some of them are actually pretty much the antithesis of Bitcoin and only share the "cryptocurrency" label.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding was that this limit does not make the transaction invalid, it makes it non-standard. A miner can still include such a transaction in a block, with 0 fee, and if they mine that block it will be accepted by other nodes.
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:36:00
Absolute trustlessness does not exist. It has always been a game of calculated risks.
Do you want to trust the close-source software from a company which runs it in the most opaque manner possible (Paypal, e-banking, etc.) or the open source software reviewed by hundreds of contributors which at it's core (consensus rules) is verifiable by yourself just by syncing your own node on the network it forms?
So "trustless" in this context is a comparative qualification, not an absolute one. And in all honesty the word might be a bit of a "marketing" term if you take it literally, but in reality developers do everything in their power to make the development process open and transparent. Even as a non-developer you can read their propositions, their discussions, results of their tests, etc... so they provide the tools necessary for you to be able to verify their work, whether you act on them or not does not change the degree of trustlessness of the system.
About your other concern, you somewhat came to a conclusion by yourself, you already use a computer, an ISP, routers, etc. which you have to turst. Bitcoin does not claim to solve these *issues*, it only offers a verifiable protocol to transact with peers on a network without a central authority.

OP is pointing out that if you use an intermediary (BitPay) which will hold funds for you, you aren't actually holding Bitcoins, you trust a third-party to provide these funds at your request. If this third-party gets hacked, is forced or decides to disappear, gets shutdown by a government, etc. you will not have control of your funds. The title is misleading, because your business does accept Bitcoin, it just does not own them until you withdraw them from that intermediary.
An alternative is [BTCPay]( by running your own server you will be able to skip intermediaries with the benefit of not having to give them a share of your benefits and you will always be in control of your funds. This project follows the API (de facto) standard of BitPay invoices so it is compatible with systems developed around BitPay solutions without relying on BitPay services.

How about nobody gets it and it stays locked from further use?
Bitcoin doesn't need a central representation on social media, it's not a business/company, not an individual and it does not need to communicate with the public as such. Nobody is trying to talk in the name of TCP and it's fine this way. And everyone/every company is still able to start their own account to talk about their business related to Bitcoin if they feel like it.

And contrary to what many cautious posters said here, he didn't seem to mean any harm and just wanted to test/use the network. But what's important is that their fears were unfounded anyways, as his node on LN had no more power/weight than other nodes, he only brought more capacity than others.
Even if you opened a channel with his node and it became unresponsive after you spent some funds, at worse you would have had to wait for the timeout of your LN channel and you'd have gotten back all your funds (including the ones you spent to him)... there is a strong incentive for people running nodes to have a high uptime. Obviously you will also tend to not open channels again with a node that is unreliable... yet you never have to risk funds to "test" a node.

Because dominance means almost nothing in this space when you can create currencies in a matter of minutes and artificially bump their **market** value. If people actually thought they were valuable then their price would be decoupled from BTC after few months but none of the altcoins seem to be able to achieve this. ETH is the one that is the closest of doing this at times because it has proven to have some other use cases (ICO's mostly), which does not mean it is a good or bad altcoin, it's just an observation.

@_date: 2018-04-29 21:53:42


For accuracy, there's is a way to double spend a 0-conf transaction but it is reasonably difficult enough to pull off, so some merchants agree to take this small risk.
To achieve such a double spend you'd have to send a second transaction using the same inputs with a higher fee sent to other outputs (most likely one(s) you control) to a part of the network that is currently not yet aware of the original transaction. If this second transaction gets mined first, the original transaction will be rejected. Even if these miners get the first transaction after the second one (and before they have mined any), they will have an incentive to mine the second one (higher fee). RBF makes this even easier to pull off, this is exactly why it is recommended to wait for 6 confirmations (RBF or not) for any transaction of moderate/high value.
Just to be clear, I consider that advertising 0-conf as a secure feature, like certain Bitcoin Cash supporters do, is deceptive.

It's theoretically possible and realistically improbable considering the amount of work required to do it.

Thanks for sharing your idea, but to answer your doubt [it has been suggested many times before]( (almost every year).
In my opinion Bitcoin is way past the stage where its name has to get out and reach the masses, people know about it and the ones who have a negative outlook about it through the media fabricated FUD they eat usually won't change their mind with a 30 seconds ad.
This kind of marketing campaigns would be more useful for shitcoins to promote their scams and other ICO's nobody ever heard of (and hopefully never will).
Instead I would recommend raising this money to sponsor open source projects related to Bitcoin. You'll do much more good for Bitcoin this way than wasting [5+ millions dollars on a 30 second ad](

You're giving them a lot of credit, just like BCH supporters are giving a high fee peak for few days a lot of credit. I don't find it reasonable to look for post-rationalization this way.
It's was pretty apparent while it was happening that a 200% increase over one month (Nov 2017) was not organic growth and we were due a big correction. A lot of people were warning about it and it happened like it happens in most most markets during such bull runs.
Now the other factors you and I've mentioned might have contributed to some of the movement, but attributing them a strong causation link when all we have is a correlation in timing to try blaming any of them in particular isn't really useful... especially when you can't control those causes easily (forks will happen, fee events will happen by design for good reasons).

Many hardware wallets have their own secure chip which makes it much less likely that their content can be altered, intercepted/decrypted, etc. They also design it in a way that altering it physically makes it pretty obvious that it has been tampered with... when most simple USB sticks can easily be opened and tampered with discreetly.
It will also be quite difficult for you to setup a wallet on a computer which has really never been online these days (short of building one yourself and taking a lot of precautions)... but obviously it's all a matter of how untrustworthy you think your hardware can be. Considering the track record of Intel, AMD, Microsoft, Apple, etc. in terms of security issues I'd say that most hardware should be considered untrustworthy.
Nevertheless the more your hardware is specialized to achieve a certain task the better your chances are to avoid such issues... it's not flawless, but it will prevent you from making many easy mistakes while setting it up and also while using it. It only takes 1 mistake to leak your keys and you'll have much more freedom to make such mistakes on your home-made solution. On hardware wallets they streamline the use cases and make sure your keys never have an occasion to leave the secured device.
Obviously, if you're going to want to secure less than the value of the hardware wallet itself, it might not be a really worthy investment (but who knows, depending on the price action it might become worthy without you having to buy more bitcoins ;))... But in this case you'd still be more secured if you used a mobile phone app instead of your home-made solution. If you secure your phone correctly (PIN+Password, 2FA where applicable, encrypted device, etc.) it will still be much more secure than your usual PC workstation or any random USB stick you'd use on one.

Maybe check the link I've posted in the message you've answered to then? I'll post [the exact timestamp]( and transcript of the video:




A day is a period of 24h on this planet. This was part of the interview you pretend to have watched. Vays asked clarification for the bet that was setup few minutes earlier and Ver answered unequivocally. You must have missed it I guess.
Also, Vays has no control on what outsiders did to this transactions, be it Slushpool directly, or anyone who might have intervened to boost it. He denied on Twitter requesting any help so unless you have evidences of the opposite get out of here with your "spirit of the bet", the terms were clear and met by Vays.
Furthermore, there were [a lot of 1-2 sat/byte transactions that were confirmed up until the end of the bet]( so even without any intervention he would have clearly won this bet.
Ver should have taken the loss to this bet **per his own terms** but he won't. Every time he talks about donating to charities it's to use them for his little debating games instead of actually helping them, that's tells a lot more about his character than any of the win/loss to these stupid "offers" he always make. He's a bad faith actor and that's the reason why a lot of people refuse to debate with him.

 has few pizzerias available in the region for doorstep delivery. Depending on your city/commune availability may vary of course.
The only inconvenient is that they accept bitcoins only through Bitpay currently. So you have to use Bitpay's shitty payment protocol (some proprietary incompatible implementation of BIP70). Electrum supports it last time I've tried. Check Bitpay's FAQ for more info.
In the past you could decrypt the payment address and create the transaction from scratch yourself to pay the right Bitcoin address with the fees you wanted, but now they are enforcing the use of the payment URL in a supported wallet or refuse to process your payment on their platform. I generally avoid Bitpay for this reason among others, but obviously it's up to you... Their only redeeming act is that they do support SegWit transactions so at least you'll spare some money on fees if you do use SegWit addresses with them ;)

1. You're exploiting the work of Amazon's Mechanical Turk workers who are forced to accept their pay in Amazon\.com Gift Certificates that they cannot redeem in their countries otherwise.
2. You're exploiting the inability of certain people to acquire bitcoins without AML/KYC in their country (i.e. the people many Bitcoiners pretend to want to help, who cannot participate in the banking system).
3. You're helping people laundering money from stolen credit cards or other illegal activities.

Either ways many 1 sat/vbyte were confirmed within those 24h, Ver should take the L, make a donation to charity instead of as usual using charities as leverage in his little egotistical games.
But we all know he most likely won't, that's the problem with characters like him, they can never accept being wrong even when the blockchain says they are... even when they were the ones laying the terms of the bet. That's why most people avoid debating him or even answering his "offers".

Because 21MM (or a bit less actually) is the actual limit miners can reach through the current consensus rules. The rest is pure conjecture from journalists and chain analyses which often use it to imply there is an issue with Bitcoin for the long term. There is none in this regard.
Even with the extreme following hypothetical, if there was only 1 bitcoin left in circulation we could divide it further than the 1 million units (satoshis) that it holds. We actually do it already on LN with millisatoshis (1/1000th of a satoshi). And if it ever became an issue on the base layer I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be hard to convince miners to preserve it by agreeing on a change to do it there too. The important feature they seem to agree with is to not inflate the supply, not how much more divisible it should be.

I'm sure you will switch to the next argument that Slushpool prioritized the transactions, which doesn't matter because a lot of other 1 sat/vb transactions cleared within those 24h and Vays has no control on what Slushpool does to his transactions, he denied asking for anything.

You most likely would not reach the same standards of security than hardware wallets.
Some have secured chips, most have teams of software engineers dedicated to securing and streamlining the transaction signing processes in a way that ensures you won't leak your private keys but still allows you to use your money.
Most solutions you'll come up on your own will involve an air-gapped computer and USB... which means your air-gap is one USB WiFi adapter away from not existing, and many other ways to compromise it on your own while you setup and use it.
But sure you could try, if you feel adventurous with your funds. For the vast majority of people tough and considering the average level of competence in IT, it's preferable that they rely on proven solutions in my opinion.
EDIT: Any value under the price of one of these hardware wallet could easily be stored on a mobile phone with a decent password/encryption setup. The problem being that this value can change a lot due to Bitcoin's volatility... so it's always a risk to keep funds like this over a long period of time, statistically you risk more and more value if you zoom the chart out ;)

No thanks, those altcoins all make compromises that lower the censorship resistance of my money.
It also makes no sense, I'd have to at least do a transaction on Bitcoin to sell them (I am using Bitcoin, I'm not leaving my money on custodial exchanges), which means I can do this same transaction to open a channel on LN or spend it on-chain with a merchant.
Lastly all these altcoins have way less adoption with merchants than BTC so I'd also have to limit myself as to where I could spend my money.

Those extremists just have the *unfortunate* position of being so intolerant of other people and especially people in protected groups (it's almost like those protected groups exist because of them and the heinous acts their ideas incited in the past... go figure) that they force society to go back to the good old paradox of tolerance and apply this adage:


I know this won't please the usual libertarian crowd here which often pretends to defend unlimited freedom of speech and think Bitcoin will deliver it, but this is just a description of our current reality. Most people are not willing to accept the consequences of this kind of absolute freedom and are perfectly fine with some limits for it.
If you actually believe unlimited freedom of speech is provided to you (because you're from the USA and "it's in our constitution" for example) I suggest that you go read the [list of exception]( that exist legally, consider why they exist and how our societies would be without them. It's no coincidence that countries across the world share the same disgust and intolerance for most of these transgressions and have similar or even stricter limits.
You might think that Bitcoin can change this, but you should also consider that without their public image the people who are chosen as leaders of such movements are nothing. There's no place for anonymity in this context, you don't see anonymous people leading such movements become popular and preserve their anonymity. So in the end they'd face the same "discriminations" as you called it, you'd just see the consequences elsewhere than in their financial transactions... it might even be possible that the limits might even become tighter causing even harsher consequences to transgressors. After all, the vast majority of people gets appeased when they see those consequences happen, imagine what will happen when their opponents will be out of reach.

According to their FAQ they refund it to the sender's address minus the miner fees they have to spend to send it. 
I let you imagine what happens to your refund if you've paid using a custodial exchange and how difficult it must be to ever get it back. Not that you should use custodial exchanges as your wallet anyways but I suppose many users do this unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:02:14
That's not what the original idea is unfortunately... which makes me suspicious that the promoters just imagine they can plan a low cost socially manufactured attack to disrupt the network. They can't possibly not know the consquences of a massive influx of transactions on the same date.
Your idea is much more reasonable and I hope it's what catches on. An organic and educated use of the network rather than erratic and sudden use is preferable, the fee market of Bitcoin works like all markets with a limited supply and stressing it has very predictable outcomes.

The word "legitimacy" always felt kinda awkward to me in context with Bitcoin. It generally means being according to law, or the existing rules... when Bitcoin is there to break the existing rules of central banking.
But I agree with you, seeing it getting adopted as a common name in households and businesses (including other software) is a nice milestone, people should be happy to see it happening.

This one hit a bit close for me as I used their services last year and was relatively satisfied with them, I have even contacted them directly for support and they were very responsive and professional.
I never keep funds on exchanges longer than needed and if I had I would most likely have lost control of them right now. So I thought I'd share this to reiterate that even if an exchange "looks" serious, professional, reactive, etc. you should always withdraw your funds as quickly as possible and preferably on a secure solution like an hardware wallet.

Most likely because those aren't built to be money/currencies.
It honestly seems like you're trying to use semantic to minimizine the goals and potential of Bitcoin, it's not called a crypto**currency** by virtually everyone in this space, financial institutions, media, etc. for nothing.

It's not a "better" option if in the next few blocks your transaction gets reversed and Bitpay/AT&amp;T come questioning you thinking you're trying to scam them (pulling off a double spend).
You could argue that it's "cheaper" in terms of fees (sometimes)... but you get what you pay for and this collusion and reorg proves that it is pretty risky to transact on a coins with low hashrate.

They have legal and PR teams paid to evaluate if the liability of having these customers is worth it or not. Due to the recent attention these customers got it's not worth it anymore and the potential backlashes outweighed the profits they generate (most likely relatively small compared to other activities).
Don't think for one second that MasterCard (or any other large financial institution) has any other ideology than profit. We're talking about institutions which do not hesitate to take profit from wars, drug trafficking and human trafficking as long as it does not go public... and when it eventually does, they go full damage control and distance themselves from those bad "apples" (their sub entities) which were under their orders.

Hard to predict how it will be settled, but looking a previous exchanges which defaulted like this, there are very few people who get their money back...and if they do it takes a lot of time. It's up to you to know if it's worth your time or not to declare yourself as a creditor... I don't think it implies any fees for you, aside from the postage, but I'm no expert in this.

In which way do you assume that the taxation and justice branches of a state will give any value to such a thread on Internet?
If they can demonstrate that you've made/had money at any point and that it implied a taxable event but you did not pay taxes for it, you'll be found guilty of not paying it and forced to pay it. The fact that you don't have access to the money anymore is not relevant. You are legally bound to pay taxes as soon as a transaction is made, them allowing you to bundle these transactions and "do your taxes" once a year is just a practical arrangement.

Good thing we have already mined [many 2MB blocks on Bitcoin]( and that the theoretical limit is higher and just a matter of people adopting Segwit (which is economically incentivized with a discount).


What's not hard to predict are the consequences of carelessly raising the blocksize. Go look what happens on BCH and BSV chains, as soon as actual usage of this "free" space happens (even in inorganic and relatively controlled "stresstests"), [nodes are dropping left and right]( and you end up with [deep chain reorgs on a regular basis]( That's not how you scale a chain in production, with actual usage, securely.

As much as drawing $100 bills with your crayons on napkins is a threat to the supply control of the Fed over the USD.
It only becomes a problem if you cannot verify Bitcoin transactions yourself and people start trusting systems that are not Bitcoin. But you can't perpetuate the lies you create outside of Bitcoin on Bitcoin's blockchain, so as soon as someone is going to verify, these lies will be revealed.
This is why it is so important to be **able** to run nodes with reasonable/affordable means (i.e. you should not need your own datacenter). It's not a matter of having to run one, it's a matter of always having the ability to make sure that you're still trading with sound money.

@_date: 2019-05-25 16:10:26
1. How do you know them? Even if you're aware of all Kraken's addresses and watch all of them how do you identify the transactions that are salary payments and their recipients?
2. Why does it matter? The few "reasons" people are willing to hide their salary is either pride (because they feel that it is indicative of their worth when it's not, the sooner we change this mentality the better) or because they have to follow their employer's policy that installed them because they cannot justify the disparities and often gross injustices in their distribution among employees/executives... and also to avoid having employees aware of what competitors pay their employees. All of these are just obfuscation of something that should be transparent to provide a more efficient and fluid work marketplace.
3. I don't even think Bitcoin would solve this anyways (unless people voluntarily use it for this), as soon as we'll have improved privacy on the base layer with Schnorr signatures and signature aggregations this wouldn't even be a question. Meanwhile it can even be hidden with the various CoinJoin implementations we have (not perfectly though).

Yes, [Ledger has some proprietary secure chip, with good reasons attached to it, Trezor offers a more open source approach]( it's up to you to decide which proposition fits your philosophy/needs better. In any case you do rely on the business reputation and both have a good reputation in my opinion.


No idea how I could quantify this. The simple fact that those attack vectors exist, have been found in the wild by security experts and considering that most hardware has been connected to Internet (even 10 years old laptops) it's enough to convince me to consider specialized hardware more secure.
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:31:05


That's because you don't seem to understand the purpose of hardware wallets. They are not limited to cold storage, they are used to sign transactions in a separate environment than the computers/devices you use to create transactions in order to never leak your private keys. This makes it possible for you to use them on computers you don't trust at all (you shouldn't trust your own computer to begin with anyways). [A. Antonopoulos explains it, as usual, much better than me](
Even if we consider only cold storage, your solution relying on general purpose hardware (USB stick) would have to be setup on a air-gapped computer (good luck with that nowadays... and no a clean install without an Internet connection isn't an air gapped computer) and it would still have a much wider attack surface than specialized hardware.


What makes "your" hardware yours? And what makes it more trustful than other hardware you'd buy like an hardware wallet?
When you say this you put a lot of trust into something that also has been proven time and time again to be unsecure (see Intel/AMD security issues earlier this year for example). Hardware wallets are not perfect by any means, but they are way more secure than virtually any solution you can come up with when you're improvising on general purpose hardware.
@_date: 2018-12-24 12:59:45
Ranges from things like [HDD firmware reprogramming]( [BIOS reprogramming]( to any hardware with memory which could persist during and after a clean reinstallation of your system. Due to the scale of usage of this general purpose hardware it's a relatively serious risk.
It's really a matter of you not being the one who built and configured "your" hardware... so you should never trust it by default just because you've bought it yourself.

I wish their bankruptcy procedure shows they are not complicit of any crime and that they are insured so you could maybe get back your money somehow but as you said chances are slim to none and it takes a very long time (see Mt. Gox).
Did you receive the open letter from their new Administrator with the form to prove their debt towards you? Even for a relatively small sum I would maybe try this.
I only had "dust" left on their exchange, BTC they would not transfer as it was under their limit... so I doubt I will use this, but for 800€ it might be worth a try. Good luck!

You've asked where they are, I'm just pointing out what projects with this on their roadmap ended up yielding.
I do not imply it won't happen in the future, it's just clear that currently it's not really on the table... as you've just pointed out we've made more room in blocks with Segwit, so why do you figure they will be increased again "soon"?

So basically the one who reads the will first wins it all... if they know how to use Bitcoin. Otherwise it is going to be the person they are going to ask how to use Bitcoin who is going to defraud them by asking them the private keys in order to "help them" ;)
This is a less than ideal solution, it even prevents you from making a notary will, unless you're OK with both the notary and potential witnesses to read the will and know your decryption key.
[Multi-sig solutions are usually recommended by Andreas Antonopoulos]( but he also admits that it is not ideal and that it is one of the current shortcomings of Bitcoin for many reasons.
I don't really have better solutions to offer than the ones Andreas describes and if there was an easy way to solve this without requiring trust, Bitcoin would most likely become much more valuable to a lot of people as it would increase its utility tremendously.

You'd think for any app related to banking, cryptocurrencies and money transactions (outside of Google Play microtransactions which they already monitor) they'd be a bit more careful and use human verification... but I guess it's way more costly to do than just wing it and wait for scam victims to complain ��
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:18:11
"since you'll be dead anyway, don't sweat it too much" isn't a solution. It can be planned better than just in a will and a single decryption key (for example with multi-sig) and that's what I was arguing... so I don't really see your point.
In the case of multi-sig the notary isn't in possession of enough information alone to forge the will and steal money, he'd need do collude with other parties in the multi-sig scheme.

[Vays said he had a day and Ver said yes]( that's roughly 24 hours on this planet. Where is the weaseling  here?

@_date: 2019-05-21 21:54:00
The scam was obvious when he was selling it under the name "Bitcoin (BCH)". Now that he has changed it to "Bitcoin Cash" under the threat of many users suing his business, I can't really see the deceit. Don't get me wrong, I still warn users about this website and tell them to avoid their services at all cost (including companies in which Ver invested).
Ver using a nomenclature no other serious business uses for Bitcoin and calling it "Bitcoin Core" only hinders his sales, he has no obligation to do his best to sell Bitcoin. His "recommendations" only represent his opinion. So I doubt the CFTC would bother with any of this honestly.
Like most scammers (because there is no doubt he was using the initial nomenclature to confuse new customers) he's not completely stupid and will edge towards illegality and rarely cross the line.
So I doubt there is anything "illegal" going on here, which means we're just left informing new users about their behavior when we can. Just like you have to inform them about other bad actors: hacked exchanges, low quality/unmaintained wallets, services which refuse to implement SegWit, etc. ... such is the ecosystem we have to deal with, I doubt any law enforcement will change something about it.
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:00:40


It actually does matter to keep people informed about it though. Not every new user is aware of those particular features, not all wallets they might use support them or promote them by default (many also become unmaintained or feature frozen and will most likely never implement those optional features of Bitcoin).

No, it's strange that you'd expect all the gateways to Bitcoin to have the same attributes as Bitcoin. 
Obviously the ones that do not even let you withdraw bitcoins are not meant for customers who want to use Bitcoin. They most likely do not intend to use it directly and see it as a pure investment vehicle. Is that *bad* or strange? Not really, it happens with most things which are transferable and valuable.

Except that Vays demanded clarification and Roger Ver said exactly how long he was willing to bet for, "Don't I have a day" -&gt; "You do".

It was laid out on the spot, clarified by Ver later, just take the L. Actually just stop defending untenable positions you don't even have to pay anything or accept defeat, Ver has.


It's not what Roger answered, you know better than him the terms of the bet he wanted to accept?

It's for users who are comfortable with a 1:1 pegged federated sidechain, where exchanges compose most of the federation, where there are emergency keys held by a private business, and where (currently) only members can run full nodes.
It's clearly not for the users who craves decentralization, trustlessness and mainly censorship-resistance. But it sure has its applications and it's totally opt-in. Bank/exchanges do rely a lot on trust/reputation among themselves right now and are potentially looking for solutions with near instant settlement (on the side-chain) and features like confidential transactions.
Those actors most likely won't mind making those compromises and still having Bitcoin as a base for the peg to insure their counterparties have the funds they say they have.
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:08:09
Great. But how about we don't do this all at the same time and just educate people to do it organically when fees are low?
Doing it on a specific date seems like a great way to generate a lot of transactions at the same time and hit the current limitations of Bitcoin which would most likely lead to an increase in fees.
I personally don't care much because I already don't give the custody of my funds to third parties unless strictly necessary, but it seems quite obvious what the results of this operation will be if it becomes popular.
