I’m thinking of quitting smoking and adding that money to bitcoin too. Only difference is I wanna go back to smoking after I become a millionaire. Gives me something to root for.

For me it was instant. So instant it was there before I bought it lol. Jk. But really it was instant. And then instant to move to gdax. And instant to buy/sell on gdax. I have not had to wait on one thing since I started using coinbase/gdax for like 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:28:08
I thought that using coinbase was like using Casino chips/money. Basically all the coins and cash are in their exchange. However when u want to send that crypto to an outside wallet that’s when they settle up your account. 
So it should be all instant. There’s no reason if you used a cc/debt that your coins aren’t in ur wallet. 
Am I wrong?

Let’s say zero down with a va backed loan.  
Now let’s say he’s got another home and living life as he has been for the past 20 yrs. paycheck to paycheck, has a retirement account, kids gone (but they still cost money even when they are gone).  
I honestly thought everyone that thinks this currency is gonna go to the moon would have said hell ya to investing it. Again it’s not like that $15k in the bank making .05% in a saving account is gonna change his life. It’s basically gonna pay for 75% of a Cheap new car that will just make them happy for 2 months.

You can do that rn for the low low price of 314bil. But you better hurry up cause this is for a limited time only.

Yes it would be worth it but at this point it would hard to become a millionaire with $100 a month. Just have realistic goals. $100 going up 10x would be $1000. That means btc is at $150k

If someone bought a house at the peak and felt it was being a bum if they walked away and instead paid what they promised to pay, coming out $15k ahead after all the commissions and fees isn’t horrible. 
In addition living paycheck to paycheck is something very common with us lower middle class people. But just cause I say that doesn’t mean I don’t have retirement accounts. 
For the most part it’s just about the straight $15k cash that someone gets that they’ve never had before. Again I don’t believe this is life changing as your talking less then it costs to buy a new cheaper car.

Again as far as the money I’m talking about, it never really existed. It was locked in a house and they were living just fine before this money came along.  
I understand what your saying tho, but given the situation I’m talking about and the possibilities to make money with money (like the rich do to get richer) why would they not take a risk.

It’s called long term or short term

From what I’ve read that would be illegal. The main reason these futures are even coming out is because that then gives them a legal way to invest in bitcoin. They can’t legally invest directly in bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:58:02
If you’ve always lived paycheck to paycheck it’s not like $15k is life changing to let’s say lower middle class people.   $500k would be life changing to some degree.

In gdax when u limit buy and put in the how many coins and price below that it will show you how much that is. No calculator needed. Just adjust your amount of coin or price to what u want/can afford. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:37:23
I’m thinking 15-16 when u wake up
Edit:  11hrs later and what do I wake up to?  $15750. Hopefully u didn’t lose any money

Coinbase is easy and they have an app.   Your dad is awesome for encouraging you getting into investing at such an early age. You should learn some good stuff from this that will follow you thru life.

It’s the 99%(which I’m part of) is so use to giving up all our secrets (id,ssn,etc) because that’s what has been implanted in us since basically day one by the government thru our parents. 
I think slowly if this catches on we will all over time be able to be anonymous. Just rn it’s not in our nature. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:30:50
Cause 99% are either zero or 1mil. Very few in the middle where it’s value is. 
If u don’t believe in it then it’s worthless. If you believe in it then it’s the moon.

You lose nothing till you cashout.

How well does futures manipulate the usd?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:08:32
Well not everyone can be right all the time.

Email the federal reserve. I’m sure they will gladly turn on the printers to help you do that.
