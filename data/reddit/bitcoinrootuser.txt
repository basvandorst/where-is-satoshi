They claim on ~0.5% of customers funds are held in their bitgo multisig hot wallets. That is obviously not the case since more than 0.5% of all bitcoins in existence were just stolen from them.

Are the transactions in these blocks typical of what we will see on the network once segwit is activated and adopted by most of the network? Or are these transactions bloated with signature data to test the limits?
Mainly curious if we will achieve these kinds of results with standard transactions or if the real benefits will come with things like LN and other types of txes offloading non standard data to segwit?
Either way segwit has achieved a 4x increase in block size without a hard fork. Pretty amazing.

~~The files unlocked before the transaction confirmed? I wonder if this would be a good use case for RBF...~~
Nevermind. The transaction did confirm. It seems like this is an issue of transaction malleability. Given that armory has a different txid perhaps the wallet is seeing both the original transaction and the one with the altered txid.
Personally I would import all the keys containing coins to a core wallet then sweep them into your new hardware wallet. I dont know my way around armory enough to help recover it without just importing the keys to a new wallet
@_date: 2016-04-23 20:40:22
Sweeping them directly is safe. I just dont know how to correct the incorrect balance in armory. Bitcoin core is pretty easy to get rid of wallet conflicts. It may be just as easy with armory but I have never used it.
My suggestion was basically import to core to get the correct balance then sweep to your hardware wallet.

You could just run a local wallet and poll the wallet for a new address on every page load. Otherwise as some have mentioned some code to store a collection of addresses in a database and update the one on the web page every time a donation is received would also work.

You cannot use blockchain analysis to prove if an exchange account has a balance or not. They likely couldn't give out information on the account until the process was complete and the account was drained before they froze it. It sucks but use common sense about whom you send bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-08-27 01:06:16
No you cannot. You should research how exchanges process deposits.
Once you send a deposit it is recorded in their database and your account is credited. Whatever happens with that transactions output afterwards is completely unrelated to the account in which it was credited. 
This is how every centralized exchange in existence works.

@_date: 2016-03-17 17:57:45
Bitcoin core as well as most wallets already solve this problem for you. 
The private key is never exposed. Just its signature. That is true with all wallets
Although it is safe to resuse an address because you are never exposing the private key, repeated signatures and a client with with weakened security can result in the private key becoming easy to guess.
To prevent this even though it shouldn't happen under any normal circumstances change addresses are used by almost every wallet provider. In fact I cant think of one that doesnt. 
If he has 10,000 bitcoins in one address and sent 10 to shapeshift to buy some ethereum the 9,990 would go to a new address in his wallet without him ever knowing. Assuming all the 10,000 coins were sitting in a single utxo. 
If they are not then you can always force all the utxo's into a single tx using raw transactions. But they you have to specify an output for the change going back to a new address yourself.
@_date: 2016-03-17 19:52:01
In the case of bitcoin core you do own the private keys. The phrase is mostly used for exchanges and web wallet providers that don't provide the private keys to the end user.
You are trusting that the open source code they have written has no vulnerabilities. But on that front Bitcoin Core is likely your safest option as it is the most peer reviewed
Like said Bitcoin Core can be ran offline greatly reducing any risk of vulnerabilities in the software. Although there are still some rng vulnerabilities that would still be vulnerable in wallets created offline.
@_date: 2016-03-24 14:24:02
1. The lead maintainer of bitcoin core seems to think he does. 
2. Unnamed backup people. Real confidence inspiring.

He had to make a fuss to get coinbase to respond after 4 days of nothing. This isnt about bad actions. Its about bad customer service.

Just mix the coins before you send them to circle to sell. Circle is by far the fastest BTC -&gt; USD usually hitting my bank within 24 hours.

So...... Why was Karpeles in possession of the key?

@_date: 2017-03-21 04:12:58
Very interesting theory that actually seems plausible. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 04:28:54
I am going to assume this is a small operation and they will be mining at a pool.
1. Yes it is possible. Although you would have to be looking for it. You wont instantly know its traffic for bitcoin mining. If they are pool mining you would be able to tell based on the url they are reaching our to and the type of traffic. The url would likely be a dead give away. If you are using that as the discovery method seeing a url with bitcoin in it being hit constantly would be a pretty big giveaway
2. Yes bitcoin miners generate lots of heat and without proper cooling will heat up any room pretty fast. Anywhere from 2-10x that of a similar size server (based on power consumption). Servers can also sit idle and throw off almost no heat. Miners however throw off full heat around the clock.
3. Unlikely unless solo mining. Bitcoin mining itself uses very little bandwith. But keeping synced with the blockchain would. If they are mining at a pool then they do not need to keep a client synced and therefore would be unlikely to slow down the network
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:45:30
Fee means nothing at this point. Any large miner could include their massive transaction in a block they mine with no fees. Thus getting a significant head start on the next block while other nodes process the tx. This is what happened in the tx linked above. This was not malicious. Someone spammed the chain with dust going to keys generated by simple brain wallet passphrases. That miner just sweeped them all up since nobody else could due to the fees. Only a miner could do it.
Also limiting tx size makes little difference even. There is no reason the miner couldnt fill the block with ten 100KB transactions vs one 1 MB transaction
SPV mining helps as they wont gain much of an advantage. But reduces security greatly in my opinion. As we saw with the previous fork of f2pool and others
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:41:03
The biggest thing I took from this is pretty much an admission that he wants bigger blocks so bitmain can get more transaction fees. Seems to me they arent doing it for the best interests of bitcoin but rather their bottom line.

New evidence does state it was purchased by Wrights associates at the demand of Gavin. Still possible they could have been prepared for such a demand. At the time this was written all we had was the above statement which didn't indicate that

Ya just ignore the rebuttle by Mike Hearn
This guy open sourced the bitcoinia source code with a MtGox api key in it allowing the rest of bitcoinia's funds to be stolen. Developers didnt trust someone who makes that big of a mistake and removed him from the security mailing list. He got pissy and bashes gavin and mike any chance he gets.

Did your implementation decrypt the dataset and write it to disk? If it is looking for the encrypted dataset and finds it unencrypted I could see that causing the error.

I was putting together a post on all the references I could find with Craig Wright and Bitcoin before November of 2015 and found this little gem tucked in the corner of the interwebs.
Interesting Bits
* JC: We understand. Craig Wright took the Bitcoins that he had mined offshore. At the time, it
was worth 3-4 cents. The total value of this was around $5000. He then started up W&amp;K Info
Defense LLC (W&amp;K) with Mr Dave Kleiman. W&amp;K was an entity created for the purpose of
mining Bitcoins. Craig Wright is a forensic computer expert. He is constantly updating himself
attending courses, workshops and training sessions. He is also a university lecturer at Charles
Sturt University and conducts courses. He even provides services to some Australian
government agencies including the ATO and the Defence Force. However, this is all done on a
very high level.
 Craig Wright had mined a lot of Bitcoins. Craig then took the Bitcoins and put them into a
Seychelles Trust. A bit of it was also put into Singapore. This was run out of an entity from the
UK. Craig had gotten approximately 1.1 million Bitcoins. There was a point in time, when he had
around 10% of all the Bitcoins out there. Mr Kleiman would have had a similar amount. However,
Mr Kleiman passed away during that time. He was a war veteran; he was wheel chair bound.
The deed between Craig Wright and W&amp;K was created in 2012. W&amp;K gave Craig Wrights rights
to the Bitcoins and he has used the Bitcoins to do all this stuff.
Mr Kleiman and Craig Wright decided to start up W&amp;K because they both wanted to get involved
with Bitcoins. They recognised that this industry was not regulated and they wanted to start up a
regulated Bitcoin bank. They knew they couldn’t do this in the US so they wanted to do this in
* Before engaging in Mark Ferrier’s services, Craig Wright had
conducted lots of checks on him and everything came up clean. So in essence, Craig Wright
wanted the banking software and Mark Ferrier wanted Bitcoins.
Around mid-July/August, Craig Wright released funds from an entity located in the UK to MJF
Consulting. This was all going through a server located in Central West Africa.
Mark Ferrier was then arrested in September 2013.
* AM: We should have all the documents already provided on our systems. I have a question to
ask. Were actual Bitcoins physically paid to MJF Consulting or Mark Ferrier?
JC: Yes. We paid Bitcoins to him. We paid the Bitcoins to where he directed for the Bitcoins to
be paid into.
AM: Just to confirm, was it actual physical Bitcoins that was paid?
JC: Yes.
I titled this undisclosed because they never really seem to mention a figure for the transaction. It could be buried in there but ill have to look again later as I was falling asleep before finding this.

Its a free course that was put online back in 2013. Not sure how this is a scam by him. 
Probably not the greatest idea the university had though.

I still dont understand all the strange fee overseas. It makes it really hard to get a good idea of how many people are actually trading and how much money is just going back and forth.
I traded at an altcoin exchange over there once that had a 10% deposit bonus, 10% withdrawal fee and a 0.5% trade fee.
Worked out for the site owner I guess. 10% more trade fees but where do they come up with these things?

The database is obfuscated due to past issues with antivirus software. If someone would store a virus signature in the block data some AV software would quarantine or delete the block data. Obfuscating it prevents that. I think its just a simple xor with the key stored in the above location

Nobody knows at this point besides Gavin. It's entirely possible he is just a weird guy who didn't want to come out of hiding but "had" to as he states. Hence all the odd antics.
Its also entirely possible its a bluff and he chose Gavin and others as subjects he thought he could fool.

You could start by explaining where you got HIS address from in the first place which seems unlikely. 
That wont prove you own it but may make someone believe you are not completely full of shit and help you prove it is actually yours.
You have not given an explanation as to how it happened and seems like you set yourself up a nice little situation you just cant prove. Stating you were using tor which means nothing about the transaction. 
 So for now I will believe you are full of shit

That's the error you are getting from bitcoind. I was reffering to the error you get from pywallet. Yo uwill get the same error likely with gavins bitcointools. 
The last link I posted ran in a sandbox environment will recover any keys in the wallet that were not corrupted. 
What happened:
Your wallet got corrupted. Buts its likely some if not the majority of the keys are unaffected. Pywallet believes the wallet is open by bitcoind because it cannot read part of the file. The above script goes through the file looking for any string resembling a private key and build them into a new wallet.

Useless in this situation. Are you a bot programmed to post that link every time some asks if their coins are lost?

Gemini offers all of these if they operate in your state. Their customer service is miles ahead of coinbase imo.
@_date: 2016-05-20 22:26:58
I actually have though a lot about this. If the network does move to a new algorithm other than sha256d the old address can still be "secured" using sha-256D. 
It would make for an interesting market where people would mine these old addresses for lost coins and recover them.
This is assuming the algorithm would be switched well in advance before it became too weakened. Giving everyone fair notice to move their coins to a new address protected by the new algorithm.
 It would certainly be more profitable than mining for tx fees i believe. But i doubt it will happen in my lifetime. Or at least early enough for me to take advantage of it. Sha256d is very strong.

You are wrong. Learn a bit more about the situation.

I have had something like this happen once. Turned out it was an old LTC mining pool that I never set a payout threshold for. When the owners decided to close they nicely sent my balance to my accounts payout address for me.
I would guess it is your money you just don't remember where it came from. I only found out because the address the coins came from was associated with the pool via walletexplorer.com

Coinbase has been around more than long enough to be out of its "growing pains"
That excuse cannot be used for coinbase. With its millions of dollars in VC funding there is absolutely no reason they should experience any issues from a sudden surge of users.

The speculation is they are insolvent on ETC not BTC. Although some have taken it a step further to speculate they had to purchase ETC with BTC to become solvent again.
The speculation about ETC insolvency is backed up by the fact they were leaking ETC for some time after the split.
