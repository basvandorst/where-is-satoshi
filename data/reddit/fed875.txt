You can buy any USD value worth of bitcoin...you don't need to purchase "a bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:15:50
Yes, you can invest any amount you want.

It’s a pretty clear double negative. There’s no way this “won’t” or “can’t” go wrong, I.e. it will most definitely go wrong

This is odd, probably highest velocity price movement I've ever seen..like 100 bucks in 10 seconds? damn son!

The value of the currency those words are printed on is less than what a piece of paper of that size would’ve been.

There is no good or bad time....if you like bitcoin and believe in its future, buy it! No one knows what it’s value will be in the future

Well I hope so now it’s too late.

He constantly talks about the price of bitcoin on his podcast. Whenever it fluctuates he says things along the lines of  "we were up 50% today," which tells me he's probably part of the bitcoin community. 
He is correct in identifying it as a bubble in which people are buying into with hopes of an increase in price in the future. As far as I know bitcoin isn't being regularly traded for goods/services and isn't stable enough (yet) to be considered a reliable store of value. It also isn't really an investment since the entity itself is not productive like a business is. It's more of a gamble. 
Some of his criticisms are valid, though he's wrong to say it has no intrinsic value, considering the underlying technology is incredibly valuable.

Bitcoin is cheaper than when you sold at 8000 so yes

Why cash out everything...take out your principal and maybe some profits if you’re in it for the long term.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:13:54
These predictions are wrong 100% of the time
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:18:58
What? He will receive whatever bitcoin quantity he purchased at the 7000 price point. He won't have more btc, though the value of the btc he purchased will be higher

Got it, just wanted to clarify

Resistance at 8900? Interesting!

Given how unpredictable this market it is I still think it's reasonable to "wait" until 2k to buy (though it's unlikely it'll ever dip to that). However it's smarter to buy at pretty much any price point imo. Buy when it's surging, buy when it's crashing, buy when it's sitting there and doing jack shit.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:48:03
I’m even more conservative, maybe sell 5% to take some gains. Depends how much you have I guess too

Is understanding what bitcoin is really critical thinking skills? It's not like they were asked to analyze the pros and cons of a decentralized monetary system. They were given two terms - "dollar" and "bitcoin," and asked which they prefer. If one has never had exposure to bitcoin, which is still not yet mainstream, and did not know what it was, is that the fault of their school system?
Also the only reason the vast majority people who know what bitcoin is would prefer bitcoin to one dollar is because it is valued at 8000 USD, not because of the underlying technology.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:27:03
Not sure how education about cryptocurrency would find its way into a school system. Unless it was part of an economics class or something, which isn’t typically a required subject.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:18:03
Bold claim. I don’t think you have any reason to believe it will never dip below 9k after another ATH. No one’s intuition is ever right about bitcoin. Other than a long term trend upwards.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:13:53
what makes ya say that
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:41:22
With current trends I predict bitcoin will be worth between 1 cent and 40 million dollars by the year 2200
@_date: 2019-05-27 19:29:29
Does the past really predict the future with bitcoin? Especially considering it’s a non correlated asset...do we really know what drives these cycles, and whether they’re actually “cyclical” in nature (I.e. will continue the same trend indefinitely?) 
My only point is that there’s no guarantee bitcoin will stay above/below any price point. Predictions are nothing short of speculation.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:15:10
Why everything? If you truly believe bitcoin will surge in the future why eliminate your position entirely?
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:32:49
I sort of agree with the majority of economists who think this is essentially a bubble, where people are only buying with hopes that someone else will buy at a higher price...
The technology is indeed amazing, however, but by looking at most of the comments here (and I'm guilty of this myself), people are hoping btc skyrockets in value so they can just convert back to USD and be rich! Nothing wrong with that, but it's consistent with what the mainstream characterize bitcoin as: a bubble
Anyways, I'm hodling indefinitely
