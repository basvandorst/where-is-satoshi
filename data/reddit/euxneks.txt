I will bet right now that even without reading the article, the person claimed to be Satoshi is not actually Satoshi.

Here is where you should have elucidated for the clearly uneducated.

I dunno if this fits your criteria, but the physics I would use for it is primarily the electricity use vs the miners, basically getting down into the grit of chip design etc. Though I would have to admit that isn't entirely what bitcoin is about, it would help explain scarcity of the coin :)

I don't get what's edgy about the parent's comment?
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:24:07
That's pretty impressive actually.

Scumbag reporters: Harass someone with the same name as an internet mystery, blame others for that harassment.

If this man was not named Satoshi Nakamoto at birth the links between him and bitcoin Satoshi would be tenuous at best.

Redditor for 2 years at least...  I suspect they know who he is but not what he researches. Frankly I'm not all that familiar with it myself, but I think there is something to do with birds, maybe? :)

A letter "Dorian Nakamoto" wrote about East LA's train service: 
To me, this does not look like the same writing as *the* Satoshi who wrote about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:03:43
That's certainly blown up in their face then.

Japanese men don't necessarily have a lot of facial hair. I've so far gotten about 7 shaves out of an Astra DE blade so far - I mention this because some people claim you can only use a razor blade a couple of times. I think this is not true unless you have steel wool for a beard.

Good on ya, dude! Stick with the original and it will become stronger!

Holy shit. It looks to me like it's at 6K USD already and growing?

We don't know the context of that statement. What was her question?
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:19:23
Satoshi just posted he's not Dorian:

Ah! Quebecois!

That is a damn beautiful vehicle. When they pass by while I'm biking I have to double take. Beautiful car.

He makes this claim with no proof - if it's not ad hominem it's nosing pretty close to it.

My talk with HIB in chat:
→Hello, do you guys accept bitcoins?
Wes: sorry!
Wes: no we do not.
→Is there any particular reason why not?
→Just out of curiosity?
Wes: We like BitCoin and would love to accept it, but after contacting the EFF and a lawyer specializing in this sort of thing, we are not comfortable with the plethora of untested issues and legal traps, which would be a major distraction for us.
Wes: We have been in contact with a number of bitcoin startups, and will be monitoring the landscape carefully.
→Cool thanks for your answers :)

The number of bitcoins minted per block halves around every four years - it's not constant.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:47:29
Soo... all alt-coins will be worth as much as bitcoins?

Essentially, the reason it's annoying to develop for android is the same reason it's annoying to build exploits. :P

As long as it's still used as tender for goods in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:34:36


Not if the demand outstrips the supply of currency. Currently demand is higher than the number of coins being minted on a regular basis.

Also the fact that electronics consistently get better and cheaper, yet people still buy them.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:46:26
There is no such guarantee that bitcoins will rise in the future.

For some reason I imagine you've buried it in a chest on an island.
