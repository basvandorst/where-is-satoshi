Yeah, considering at 50BTC back in Feb it was almost $32k, and yesterday the 50.25 was ~$28.5k.
So basically, there's just the capital loss? The gambling loss doesn't count as anything?
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:06:24
I'm not gonna lie... I am really tempted to do this and roll again to try to win half of it back. That would still be quite a bit of money for me. However, I wouldn't be able to handle another loss, plain and simple. While losing all I had was pretty awful, I only lost what I could afford to lose.
@_date: 2014-05-26 02:11:50
Ha, how do you think I feel? Savings is all gone, fortunately I don't have any debts and I'm financially stable, but there goes my "rainy day" fund.
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:48:01
I'd rather not.
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:17:21
Yeah, I should've gone for a walk or something instead of making decisions while I was butthurt. Nobody to blame but myself on that one.
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:05:41
I did it, man. Should've listened. Went 1.4x payout instead of 50/50, rolled hi and got a 2.

I didn't use TOR... I'm honestly not too sure about the legality, maybe the fact that there is no use of fiat on the site is a loophole?
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:42:15
fine, fine: 
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:53:23
Because anger and greed and stupidity. Not sure what you mean by income, I mean btc was an investment so I never really considered it as part of NY income. I'm not rich, but I consider myself fairly well off for my age (no debt, car paid off, etc.). No SO, so no worries there.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:47:57
Yeah, that's really not something I'd like to dwell on right now.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:21:07
Yeah, I'm trying to stay positive through this - I mean, I'm 23, so while it's a lot to me now, it won't matter much in the long run. Shit, there are plenty of people who go into more debt from student loans. At least I won't have to worry about that.
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:28:27
Plenty of people there in chat, you can go there right now and see for yourself.
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:49:24
Haha yeah, if btc really does skyrocket I'll be kicking myself for years to come.
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:18:14
Isn't that just with capital gains? I don't think this applies to a gambling loss....
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:27:53
How, if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:27:28
Not at all, it was entirely my choice and he doesn't deserve any of the blame.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:56:21
I don't have any debts and car is already paid off. I live very frugally and am used to low standard of living, so I'll probably continue that lifestyle for a few years.
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:04:08
Believe me, I'm well aware. Right now I really need to look on the bright side though, so that's what I'm trying to do.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:24:57
I didn't, I only made (then lost) 20. I bought my initial 50.
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:16:24
I don't think it's a good idea to put any more into bitcoin. I allocated all I was willing to lose already, and it is done. I don't want to make this any worse that it has to be. While $32k was quite a sum for me, being about 3 years of saving, in the long run it won't amount to much. I'll be going to school free of any loans, and once I find a well-paying job (which has been super easy for the other guys who separated from my shop so far, even without a degree - dat security clearance), I'll still be in a good position.
That's what I've been telling myself, anyway. Makes it sting a little less. It only seems like a lot now because I've been making low-tier enlisted pay up to this point. It will be remade in a few months once I get back to working after college, no big deal.
@_date: 2014-05-25 23:31:50
Thought things through over dinner, starting to flip-flop now. I mean, with just-dice there's nothing pushing me to do it now, I could do it at any time, price doesn't matter. Trying to see if there's a safe trade I could still do but the alts are in disarray, other than DRK which just won't stop shooting up. Damn I really wish I had gotten on that train instead of watching from the sidelines thinking, "Bah, too late now." I dunno man, I might just sit on it for now, though that 75/25 split seems too attractive...
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:15:59
**EDIT**: I went through with it. Went for 1.4x payout, rolled for hi and got a 2. Just lost all my savings, just like that. If anyone reads this, don't do what I did. No matter how attractive it might seem.
**EDIT2**: Since someone requested it: 
Really struggling with this right now...
I started with 50 BTC, worked up to 70 by trading DOGE the past couple months (trying to work towards 100 BTC), and this recent crash in DOGE made me cut my losses, now I'm back down to 50.2 BTC. Months of trading out the window, back to square 1. My cost basis at 50 coins is $640, up from $450 when I had 70. I could be huge in the green right now, but I'm far in the red once more.
I'm waiting for confirmations so I can do a double or nothing 50/50 roll on just-dice. 100 BTC or 0. Told myself I would never resort to gambling. Somehow, even though deep down I know I'm doing this out of rage, I can't stop. I'm trying to tell myself how much it will suck if I lose everything, but that 100 BTC goal won't get out of my head.
....maybe I should go all in at 75/25, then I'll have 75 BTC. Better odds, and it will still be like I didn't lose anything.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:22:23
A little bit of greed, and a lot of stupidity.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:24:09
Surprisingly, I didn't vomit after this happened. Didn't eat for a day though, was pretty numb.
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:29:32
I'm the OP, not sure who you mean by "he".
I'm pretty sure none of those dice sites are registered with anything, hence my uncertainty at how this would appear to the IRS...
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:20:21
Technically I started with 50 and ended up with 50.25, so I was still ahead. But yeah, at the time it just felt like I had lost 20 BTC. Bad perspective, bad reaction, bad decision. I've learned from it, and I hope someone else who may be in the same position one day will learn from my mistake.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:46:57
No, I would still feel really stupid, just happier.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:26:40
Was referring to USD amount, obviously. Read the part about my cost per coin.
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:47:50
Everything's in 2014. First bought BTC starting February, started trading soon after.

@_date: 2014-05-27 13:59:20
1. I didn't quite day trade, more like one trade a week or less.
2. Do not gamble.
@_date: 2014-05-27 03:55:28
I estimated my total net worth to be around $60k (including car), so it was a little over half of what I had. I'm separating from the military in a couple months and going to school on the GI Bill, so I basically calculated what I needed to live + emergency fund, and then put everything I was willing to lose into BTC. So fortunately, this loss (while quite huge to me) won't really affect my life going forward - I don't have any debt or anything to pay off, I've always lived frugally, etc.
That's partly why I'm so shocked at this - a gamble like this is so completely unlike my behavior. As I said in the OP, I had never gambled before, and for some reason I was just so dead-set on putting it all on one click.
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:56:30
I mean, I guess the convenience was a factor. Gambling never came up before because I've never been to a casino and I never took the time to look up those sites and register... JD is so easy, just send to the address and click away! I'm not making an excuse though - this was the result of my stupidity alone, nothing else.
@_date: 2014-05-26 02:40:56
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:10:23
True, true. In the beginning I knew the risk I was taking, but after a couple months of slowly working up and not making any bad trades, I guess I thought I had it "figured out". Either way, being able to cut losses is quite different from putting everything on one click of the mouse.
