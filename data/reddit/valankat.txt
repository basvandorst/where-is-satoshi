Good advice. The fact that taxes are this complicated is absolute insanity.

Why is  recommending such a high fee?

I've heard USendHome is just too expensive to be practical.

Since IRS treats Bitcoin as property, consider them closing costs.

Those quick pay systems limit to 2-2.5k per day. This is not a large amount.

Supposedly both are insured. This comes down to how much you trust the insurer.

I never understand this rationale of keeping debt. Let's say you have a 200k 30-year loan at 4% interest. You end up in the long run paying 343k. You are paying 143k to the bank. To me, it is not being debt-free that gives me peace of mind. It is not giving a fucking bank 71% more than the cost of the property that gives me peace of mind. I feel like this should be illegal. We should stop funding these banks.

It's based on code and consensus, which can change at any point. Also, what you consider Bitcoin today may not be considered Bitcoin in the future. Just look at the number of forks we have at such an early stage.

So to overthrow the banking system we still rely on...... a bank?

Who would've thought that people would be paying websites to store a random number for them.

Maybe this reddit should not be using twitter profile pics? I feel like r/bitcoin is filled with profile pics of Jihan Wu.

Can you point to where it says FBAR is required? Searching for "bitcoin fbar" points to articles that say the opposite.

Why the low bank transfer limits? Any plans to increase?

I think people are overdoing it with this advice. Everyone has a different risk profile. Do you store money in a bank? It's the same thing. It comes down to whether you trust your bank or Coinbase. I'm surprised people trust banks that rape everyone with hidden fees, blatant fees, interest, forex, etc.
Keeping money in just one bank I would argue is as risky as having money just in Coinbase. You should look at all of the places you store money and ask: would be ok for me if I lost this money? Spread your money around in different places and accept some risk.
Having money in Coinbase has benefits. For example, using a Shift debit card to use your Bitcoin to pay for things. Yes, I don't like supporting Visa, but these at least help to move Bitcoin towards better usability for currency.
