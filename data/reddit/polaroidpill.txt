You’re right, I assumed the LN would still have fees. Are you sure there won’t be any fees?

Indeed, this is not a “get rich quick” scheme... it’s simply a lifestyle. If you’re not ready to HODL through the rollercoaster that is BTC, this isn’t the coin for you. But the technology is there, it’s innovative, and yet to be surpassed with superior technological mechanics. To the moon brothers!

Are you doubting Bitcoin’s future deflation? Also, carrying about fellow BTCers is crucial to maintain the sense of community and fungibility. Without encouraging buying &amp; hodling, we lose out on some deflation. Plus, even buying bitcoin now is worthwhile because the deflation will continue... and the return difference will be negligible.

Bitcoin was definitely the pioneering crypto currency, but you can’t deny bitcoin staying on top  is tangible, especially with its ability to update itself as needed. Only time will tell.
