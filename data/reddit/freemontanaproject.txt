Agreed with Fiat in banks as well of course... what do you mean "You're a liability."  ???  Meaning me as a human to banks, i'm a financial liability?
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:23:35
Not saying you can't hide it for sure, just trying to make people aware of the risks. I personally would not accept stolen goods, I do find it logically (not religiously) immoral.
If you are going to do it, ideally you should have been using TOR with your Reddit account &amp; of course ran-gen a new BTC wallet key-pair &amp; tumble the coins into an intermediary wallet. 
Just don't forget the humans your helping to steal from though. It's not like your taking back something that was stolen from you (like taking back your taxes or something)... 
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:34:07
Copy, indeed. Doesn't mean Bitfinex, in this case, is not liable for losing one's money. Hold them accountable &amp; ensure they provide full recompense. Regardless Bitfinex stated they were socializing their losses because they expected that all who had a position on the exchange would have hit liquidation. 
While this is highly unlikely, i can at least accept that position as somewhat plausible. However, those who simply had money in their wallet on Bitfinex, were not in a position, clearly do not deserve to be part of the socialized losses. By Bitfinex's own logic, they should not steal from the users who did not have a position on the exchange to be liquidated...
Either way this entire incident is ripe for a class action law-suit.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:02:32
Rational indeed.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:49:06
Just in case you all didn't notice- this is an account claiming to be the alleged Bitfinex Hacker... you'd be receiving stolen goods. Not that I think it will deter anyone, since people follow incentives, just wanted to point that out- in case you didn't notice.

Based on their website their "policing" seem more inline with what used to be / should be called investigative journalism / news &amp; arguably private investigating.
@_date: 2016-04-21 18:26:28
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:53:07
Not that i advise receiving stolen goods, but you also would need to use TOR with your account since it's inception, or you'd be easily traceable... total honeypot action going on :)&gt;

As a wallet: MyCelium: 
To transfer in &amp; out of your bank- Coinbase is probably still the "safest" bet. I use localbitcoins or mycelium's p2p exchange.

Won't be courts but dispute resolution organizations (DROs). People will choose if they want automated algos to decide judgement of facts (which are built by humans anyway) or the parties will have decided human judgment. This is much ado about nothing.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:29:46
Not talking about the wallets independently- but linking the meta data of your Reddit account (thus the IP) to your wallet address, clearly makes it traceable &amp; linkable to you!

Depends on the state, most states in the US, it's legal for medical, 10 states it's recreationaly legal. All the commerce though is highly restrictive to local license :(. So the commerce is illegal, the drugs aren't.
@_date: 2016-04-07 05:33:34
That has most, but not all. Some of the laws for into effect 2016/17. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 05:28:24
Recreational: Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Washington DC, Colarado, Arizona I think, few others. Nearly all 50States in the US allow for medical MJ. Good page here (super somple to google as well):

No that changed when a lot more States followed WA&amp; CO's lead.

How about defense for profit makes a lot of sense. It's called private security, private investigators, bodyguards. The future encompasses all those services in mass, via free market competition. Not sure what value "Policing" specifically would have. It assumes there is a standard by which all follow, outside of NAP- which simply isn't reality- nor valuable.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:59:12
He chose his friends, his career, he chose those words to express an idea... but he's not really a "freedom" user &amp; finds it boring? Ahuh...  Freedom only means two things; opportunity to pursue: choice &amp; competition. Not sure any1 disagrees; simply most people want free stuff or to tell others what to do, but not be told themself what to do (contradiction in logic) creates people like him.

Much simpler to run OB than an Apache web-server &amp; build HTML, etc... Also a lot less risky (vulnerabilities, etc.)

 Schiff just said intrinsic value... ahuh. 
A) econ101: no such thing; all value is upto the individual &amp; changes in an instant. Hence why markets exist to measure &amp; test multiple individuals value indicators for a given "thing."  
B) You can't eat either asset, so even a pragmatic value is out of the question.  
Here is a hint Schiff; diversify your business deeper into cryptos, so you don't have to embarrass yourself by saying things you know are completely illogical.  This is more like a scared CEO, losing his market &amp; some random dude- than a debate. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 20:52:10
It was pretty obvious before...
@_date: 2016-03-18 02:00:21
Not understanding the fascination here, USAA hasn't done anything- they are making a call to the Coinbase API to pull in some very basic info... this is useless.
@_date: 2016-03-12 05:59:44
Indeed, great point.
@_date: 2016-03-22 16:58:17
In an automated way, it may be difficult, however, correlation is easy. BTC address (source) tx &gt; to btc-e wallet id &gt; btc-e trade logs (subpoena, gov may force them to build an API to query) &gt; to destination. Tumbling is much more effective. However, you can still correlate based upon "likely" spends. To stand up in court, you'd likely need corroborating evidence though. 
To be fair, most governments, even the US government, isn't super interested in following the rule of law anyway. So if they catch you doing something suspicious, they'll likely find a way to "fry" you regardless of real evidence or not (Taxes, Court, No-fly lists, Watch lists, DHS's new "snitch" system, etc.).
@_date: 2016-03-13 15:08:03
Not sure there is a difference, however comapies can only achieve the evil (violation of NAP) they do, by leveraging the state. Without a state, corporations as we know them, would never be able to accomplish the evil they do now. By default, in a free market, companies can only do good, or they'd be out of business. Today they are empowered by the state. Hence, the state is the root cause, well that &amp; child abuse anyway (we'd have no violence if people raised their kids with non-violence &amp; self-esteem).
@_date: 2016-03-16 20:54:49
It's the ideal way to go, for sure, since there is so much hashing power to ensure integrity.

Damn might need a bigger blocksize after all...
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:15:14
No, not too late to start, lots of room left in the price. So long as the fundamentals of an asset remain, it's value will constantly grow (not seeing fiat currencies die off anytime soon). The Bitcoin TAM is about 1/3 of the worlds economy with current market interest.
Don't forget about the halvening in July &amp; decide for yourself.

There are plenty of p2p tumblers, you don't have to use a particular service, that is run centrally- further more, lots of money flow through tumblers today without loss or logs.

Indeed, good point.
@_date: 2016-03-20 00:20:27
Nope, it doesn't make you sound like a dick, this is a great approach &amp; I always take the opportunity to enlighten people about Bitcoin. Often, i've also not purchased things, if a business doesn't take Bitcoin so that they were incentivized to look into it. When i say, no thank you, they typically ask more about Bitcoin, as they see not using it- actually drives to a lost sale. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 14:18:02
Tumble your coins always- privacy is appropriate regardless of what your doing. Keep prying eyes guessing. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:50:03
Sounds creepy (stalkerish) to me. No net value to doing this, all they have done is made a call to the coinbase api to display your information, which is now also likely mirrored in their system. Why would someone find this valuable? -serious question, i'm curious.
@_date: 2016-03-22 17:01:28
A real meta coin-mixer would be great, especially if it's ledger was encrypted say DASH over 10 different coins or something. Bottom line- my original point is mixing becomes more obfuscated &amp; ultimately drives towards 100% effectiveness, as more &amp; more tx (transactions flow through), regardless of then given tx's risk level. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 20:06:38
&amp; pay a lot more to host you own website as well...
@_date: 2016-03-23 14:07:02
Still need to spend value via a coin, which can ensure the integrity of the "spend" aka: the blockchain. Doesn't mean the bchain needs to be public. People want privacy &amp; transactional integrity.
@_date: 2016-03-08 00:17:44
Thank you for the reply. Just my personal preference, however i simply look at my BTC wallet to do this...

True, it is a rudimentary counter measure. The more tumbler traffic, the more effective it is- as there is so much noise, it's indistinguishable.

Point is; if an interpreter is Turing Complete, there is no possibility of something being "Smarter." All blockchains run on computers, they all function the same way- hence Tanenbaum... if you actually knew what you were talking about, you'd realize how ridiculous your comments are.

Reddit needs a "Government increasing violence button" so that we can create a real-time threat meter. This is what happens when you build a centralized apparatus with a monopoly on violence &amp; money. Sadness.

The author clearly has an elementary understanding of technology. You can have resilience &amp; primary applications that do not run directly on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. No reason why the consensus functionality (which is driven by the Bitcoin incentive to provide compute / storage) would need to be more extensible.
I do agree that private blockchains have minimal value, outside of secure transactions &amp; ledgers. The p2p communication components of Bitcoin is where the value lives, that Ethereum &amp; other p2p-middleware solutions are building.

Deposit or exchange? There is no limits on Bitcoin wallets, cept 21mil BTC...
Assuming you mean exchange, then local Bitcoins would be ideal. Most bank integrated systems will have limits &amp; if you exchange more than 10k in the US, your withdrawal from your bank will be flagged by the Gov.

@_date: 2016-05-02 17:34:02
You simply need a minimum of two nodes designed to collaborate, that autonomously mirror each others functionality, to be considered- "Decentralized." Lots of people bastardize this term &amp; confuse it with distributed. The value of blockchain is consensus, decentralization is a means to ensure the consensus has integrity, since it's validate from a multitude of discrete parties. Levels of consensus exist in many database technologies previously. The key invention, is decentralized consensus, which dramatically reduces threats &amp; likelihood of manipulation. Hashing further provides an easy means to verify data across decentralized nodes.
To completely eliminate middle-men you need a few major components:
*p2p Message Protocol: means by which you mirror data to N+ nodes
*Functional Protocol (Typeically designed to break up pieces of work between nodes- consensus, tx validation, file assembly, etc.): (mirrored functional of N+ nodes) think "bitcoin" as the application of bchain
*Hashing: to easily verify data via a multitude of nodes - technically optional, but hard to achieve scale w/o it.
*Encryption: ensure data &amp; most meta-data is hidden - optional, but ideal given your scenario of middle-men threats
*Incentive layer: something similar to bitcoin or other value that ensures nodes participate - this one technologically debatable, however, no human does anything without rational self interest.

From the article: “Internally we’ve advanced in several areas of technology and science that leads to higher scalability, higher performance, lower latency, higher security and more flexibility (over Ethereum)."
Ahhh...ok, that's not smarter, thats more "reliable" on the Bitcoin bchain than ETH due to mining. They also seem to externalize lots of functions within roostock to ensure lower latency, higher scale, etc... so it's not likely to be fully decentralized either...
I love Bitcoin, but this is full of marketing fluff.

Let me rephrase for reality: Government starts gathering cronies to support regulation, exchange special favors, so they can attempt to make Encryption useless. Ultimately fail &amp; later create laws &amp; regulations, as an excuse to use violence against people.
