At [12.00]( he sais that HTLCs will never happen, bc somehow they are only a sort of security backup. 
I don't get this. I thought HTLCs were exactly the tool to make the multi-hop case secure. I would have thought that any payment in the lightning network would be a HTLC. How can payments in a multi-hop case be secure without HTLCs? 
@_date: 2016-04-27 06:38:28
Awesome, great work guys! We need much more researchers to look at lightning and bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2016-04-14 22:50:53
The difference between 21.co and many other companies is that 21 is actually building products that could never be built before bitcoin. Many companies in the Bitcoin space just assume that bitcoin use will take off and they will be lifted by the tide. We need companies that give people a reason to use bitcoin.

Ok great, then I get it. Thx for the answer.

[BIP 9]( is a new consensus protocol for deploying soft forks
[BIP 68]( is mostly a technical prerequisite to BIP 112
[BIP 112]( is awesome. It adds a new opcode CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY to the Bitcoin scripting language that expresses stuff like: "This output can only be spent 100 blocks after this transaction was confirmed into the blockchain". Whats cool about this is that the clock only starts ticking once the transaction hits the blockchain. This makes all sorts of new applications possible like time-unlimited payment channels and the lightning network.

same for me. guess in terms of UX a home button would not hurt
@_date: 2016-04-17 13:34:21
ok cool, never clicked on that one. My two cents would be to move that button to the left and call it the home button with an appropriate icon. great project, really hope it will take off...
@_date: 2016-04-17 22:35:52
yup, for example 
There's also the IPFS javascript implementation, not sure how far along that one is though
@_date: 2016-04-24 20:46:36
But still, the transactions that are exchanged between the two parties in a channel are still HTLCs (more precisely the output script is a HTLC), right? Even if they are never broadcast...
@_date: 2016-04-20 13:39:32
the tech is still up for grabs afaik
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:50:13
Yeah, we're all hodling, guess that's why the price is going down...
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:59:16
Except that Bitcoin is for rich people only these days. Transaction fees on the level of a weekly paycheck for hundreds of millions. I'm sure these people are happy to wait for another 18 to get LN. By the time it arrives opening a channel will likely cost a monthly wage for these people...

u/davout-bc, care to explain? The main problem for building the LN without segwit is transaction malleability. How is this problem addressed by running nodes?
@_date: 2017-02-16 12:41:47
The bottom line to me is that Bitcoin has much more potential than people seem to realize. Bitcoin could be huge, it's just being back by political infighting.
We are sitting on a gold mine here, all we need to do is to increase Bitcoins's utility. We should get back to science and reason. To the moon will follow.
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:31:43




That's exactly what most people will do. Not quite sure that's awesome for bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:28:02
It's the only viable compromise at this point imo. People who are religiously against segwit or a hard fork blocksize increase are what is holding bitcoin back atm.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:26:46
I think the discussion is really about whether there should ever be a hard fork or not. Reasonable arguments can be made for both sides. I'm personally in favour of disruption as a force for innovation. Thus not opposed to the occasional hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:54:09
Plus, the LN is not zero cost, it's zero _marginal_ cost. While transactions are (almost) free, every time you open and close a channel you have to pay one transaction fee. It's like a deposit and withdraw fee. If the fee is too high, people will not use it - they will use a cheaper centralized solution instead.
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:57:59
Anything that is higher than fiat. And tx cost for fiat is going to zero for consumers (see venmo)

Anyone know if the applications for any of these patents are publically available?
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:57:51
That's not entirely accurate. The attorney fees alone for filing a software patent are upwards of $15k, so in addition to being able to read and write you must be able to front $750k+, plus you need the confidence that your patents will be worth the money. 
Not saying that Craig is (part of) Satoshi, but I'm always surprised that people seem so certain that he's not.
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:36:22
I'm wondering how many people besides Satoshi there are who can come up with 50+ patents regarding blockchain tech. Just a thought...
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:10:01
Is that true?

Cool, thx
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:08:56
Could not agree more. Bitsquares is a great tool that is punching under it's weight atm. Here is my proposal to make it more useful:
Someone should build something like the Coinbase Buy Widget on top of BitSquare. Allow Bitcoin businesses to easily accept fiat currencies through a web interface. Many Bitcoin businesses could be much bigger if they were to accept fiat, BitSquare could be the tech to enable that.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:36:48

CCS (where this was presented) seems to be an interesting conference for bitcoin stuff, here is a link to the conference proceedings: 
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:46:08
Well, I guess bitcoin businesses kinda care
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:55:29
The question is not what you would pay personally. Basic economics dictates that if you raise the price you get less demand. Every single bitcoin business becomes less competitive in the process. That's not a way to grow bitcoin, that's how you drive consumers back to fiat.
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:57:38
I agree with your last paragraph, but do have a comment on the first two.
The economic principle I am referring to is the demand curve (I'm sure you know this but here is a link for readers how might not:  It says that at a high price a good has limited demand, whereas at a low price it has a lot of demand. According to this theory, we will have  scenario (2) with high transaction fees, but at low transaction fees we will have scenarios (1) *and* (2).
@_date: 2016-11-28 16:00:39
What is a spam transaction?
@_date: 2016-11-24 20:11:23
This argument is like a bank saying: "Sorry, we cannot process your order right now - however we are not worried about that at all, this is just a DDOS that happens regularly". That's not how to build a secure system. A secure system is one that cannot (easily) be DDOSed.
If there is another bank that can process that order, the consumer will take his/her business there. If this keeps happening to Bitcoin, consumers will take their business to either an alt-coin or to fiat.
@_date: 2017-01-27 20:17:50


Agree that this should be corrected to the figure for wired connections. It is a very important point though. Is there a reasonable argument that the blocksize should increase at a lower rate than growth rate of bandwidth?
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:24:59
Thanks for pointing to cashila, looks interesting. Just trying to say that there should be more user friendly services for fiat&lt;-&gt;bitcoin conversion to be used in applications. Building that on top of BitSquare seems appealing to me due to it's decentralized nature. If successful businesses were to use a service like that it would drive liquidity to BitSquare and users could trade at a fair price.
@_date: 2016-11-28 14:37:14
Sorry man, just deleted the comment in the second you replied bc I realized that I was arguing for tying blocksize to hash rate, whereas this thread is about tying blocksize to previous average block fill rate...

I'm happy to hear you say that. So can we actually all agree that we will have to increase the blocksize eventually, we are just discussing timing and terms?

Just so that everybody knows whether to up or downvote this.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:32:17
Interesting, thx for pointing that out.
Of course the second part of my comment is a bit of a joke, but in all seriousness, could flex cap be the starting point for a more constructive debate about the future of Bitcoin? It's been pointed out to me by u/theymos  a couple of days ago and it u/nullc seems to support it as well. Also does not seem to be too far away from the position of the big block fraction.
I strongly feel that the best thing we can all do to increase the value of Bitcoin is to think hard about what unites us rather than on what divides us. We all want to see Bitcoin succeed, we have to work together to get there.
@_date: 2016-11-28 12:58:42
I think it would be hugely beneficial to this discussion if someone familiar with the details here could write up a realistic estimate about how much scaling we will get out of seg wit. This should really not be about two camps fighting, we all have to work together to build the best Bitcoin network we can.
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:35:58
It's a good point. As far as I know I cannot change the question now. Given that the post does not seem to be getting a lot of love I'm not going to post a new one (will def vote if you do).
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:02:13
It does not matter. In it's current state bitcoin is not user friendly. Most Bitcoin users have no idea what the problem is (and don't care I guess), they just have a bad experience.
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:00:17
It's the only one I can think of myself too, but here is why I think it's a bit misguided. It's not like off chain solutions are free, they are just much cheaper than on-chain solutions. 
Take for example the lightning network. Sending money there is not free, there is a cost associated with opening and closing a channel. That cost is the transaction fee. Thus if the transaction fee rises x%, the cost of using the lightning network goes up by x%. The same is basically true for any smart contract. Thus with high fees, some smart contracts will not be economically viable. 
My bottom line is: If we want Bitcoin to take over the world we should work hard to get it as good as at all possible. Price is one point, decentralization is another, both are important.
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:10:31

What you describe is actually the economically best solution imo: one central hub that everybody has a channel open to. That is in fact the topology that minimizes cost. But that is already assumed in my answer. If you have a more complex channel topology the price will even be higher.
As someone else pointed out, hash time locked contracts (htlcs) make is possible to not have to trust the hub.

@_date: 2017-05-13 11:44:02


Yup, assuming channels are unilaterally funded opening a channel costs 1 tx fee (the funding tx), closing it costs 3 (commitment tx and a spending tx for each party). In addition, many channels will be one way in practise. Sender pays 3 out of the 4 fees. That's about $2.70 at todays rates.
Say you open a channel with $20 and send 200 payments at $0.10 each. That's a cost of 1.35 cents per transaction which is 13.5% or about the level of on-chain fees for litecoin today. If tx fees were to rise to say $5.00 the cost per tx would be 7.5 cents which is 75% and way to high for micropayments.
The lightning network is not free, it's cost is proportional to on chain fees. We need low fees for lightning to enable micropayments.
