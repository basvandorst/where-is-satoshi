I am unfamiliar with Japan tax laws, please explain

Japan is anticipating an exodus of money leaving China and are trying to be an intermediary to help the rich get their money out. That's why they are doing negative interest rates and are leading the charge with bitcoin.

This reminds me of that episode of family guy where Peter makes his house his own country

Up until now all I've know about Barry was that little picture icon of him grinning that pops up when people link to stuff about GBTC.  That was pretty refreshing to see him in action and defend his position.

I was thinking more of the Freedom Fighter Remember 9-11 God bless America Market.

An article like this a year ago would have doubled the price. Now it seems stuff like this goes overlooked. I wonder what kind of news is needed to affect the market?

To the Rooooooom!!!

And all my friends called me stupid when I double downed at 410. Thank you bitcoin for proving to them that I am not stupid, but rather lucky.

How many people are waiting for the price to go under 400 until they start buying again?

Where's the committee for all the billions who are not sitting in pointless committees, wasting other people's money?

Honestly they just need to get educated about it.  I get it, but I ain't about to go preaching bitcoin to vendors/suppliers.  Cash has worked since forever and if it ain't broke why fix it.  Capturing the mmj industry would be big for bitcoin though.

Yeah imma take a pass on that. Thanks tho.

Honestly 10k a day is impressive considering no one really gives a shit.. except for you.

I am heavily involved in the cannabis industry here in California and for the most part... no one fucks with bitcoins.  Everyone thinks it's either a scam or it can get hacked and lose it all.  In most peoples eyes it is much safer to store their cash underneath their beds.  Old school mentality.  If bitcoin were to catch on... it would be yuuuge.

IT'S MY MONEY AND I NEED IT NOW!

I'm going to do my part and call 100 hookers on backpage and ask if they accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-17 02:57:09
Alright fess up, which one of you was it?
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:35:17
1. No, havnet heard
2. The 3 hr btc process
3.  To be honest the owners of this exchange look a little young and with all the shadyness going on with past exchanges credibility and professionalism is a huge determining factor on where I store my money.

This is awesome!
