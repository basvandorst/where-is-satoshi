There is a libertarian running for senate in Missouri who is very pro bitcoin. Just read an article that he received the largest bitcoin political donation in us history 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:03:11
So here’s my organization.
We do three thing
1) give new beekeepers and interested people bees and beehives ($250/hive)
2) fund pollinator gardens ($500/Garden )
3) concert land into pollinator habitat ($1000/acre)
There are far greater organizations, in my area the foundation for blindness, girls hope boys hope, and many others.
But you can have a direct impact on honeybees and a lasting impact on pollinators.
For $10,000 you can fund 40 new beehives,
For $50000 you can fund 1000 pollinator gardens
For $100000 you can fund 100 acres of permanent pollinator habitat.
Thank you for changing the world for the better

... the US dollar has literally been the worlds reserve currency forever...
@_date: 2015-06-08 18:15:11
its roughly double the value because our currency has lost half its value.
@_date: 2014-11-18 03:08:15
What do they do with non-legal tender... such as counterfeight money or money from unrecognized governments such as ISIS? Surely they don't sell these seized assets.
@_date: 2014-11-17 23:58:13
I don't understand... why are the bitcoins being auctioned off? 
Would it not make more sense to just destroy them? 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:36:54
so resistance is futile?
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:55:31
I understand what a filibuster is... but won't they just vote on the issue whenever he finishes speaking? Like tomorow?
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:21:50
Sorry for being politically ignorant. Can someone explain to me how  a filibuster actually works? Is there a deadline for the senate to pass the extension? Is Senator Paul planning on talking until after the deadline passes? If he does, can't they just pass a new version of the patriot act tomorow?
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:38:11
I know its the right thing to do... I just can't do it right now.
What if I borrow the money and it doesn't work?
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:04:06
uhh... ok... I didn't really have much invested in these coins... I got them for the equivalent of like $25 in wowgold in 2011... 
I will try but that's going to be expensive as fuck
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:51:11
The bitcoins? I doubt it and I don't know how to explain it to my mom
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:55:28
If you are near jenks ok stop by the aquarium... it's incredible
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:10:54
I didn't know I posted in @_date: 2017-08-03 19:05:25
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:53:33
any suggestions?
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:57:28
ya my mom has insurance.... but she is devastated.... teh money would help temporarily.... The fire started in my computer... how I am not sure.
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:06:14
I'd Tyra anything but how likely is it to work? I'm working with limited money and have to put all my eggs in one basket
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:59:06
I don't really care if you believe me. I got them almost seven years ago for some wow gold. I'm sorry you think I'm a dumbass. 
The only reason I want the btc is to help fix my moms stuff
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:38:52
I've gone back couldn't find any sign of it or usb 
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:39:55
great idea
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:53:13
no I still have 10 toes
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:55:44
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:46:27
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:56:48
ya. I like this.... but I'm finally considering selling if I can salvage them. My mom could really use the money.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:12:23
Thanks... I'll keep my fingers crossed
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:45:14
I'd rather be called a fascist by a socialist then support the communists in the dnc. It's going to be a long 8 years for you both. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:05:58
I had a backup and seed on a usb and written down on paper. Both were lost in the fire.
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:04:07
So I doubt I recover my coins... what happens to them? They just stay in the chain forever? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:15:42
Dig deeper. Find some good stuff. Whether or not you agree with illegal immigration it is one of the main reasons why our president was elected
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:55:54
guarentee I didn't use what? The bitcoins?
I put them away for three years and then looked at them when I bought a new gaming rig in 2014. Until yesterday I hadn't put alot of thought into them. 
Frankly had my moms house not burned down I wouldn't think of selling them. My plan was to hold them until they were worth enough to actually take me to the moon.... or until I had a family and I would give each of my kids a few BTC to pay for college. 
At the end of the day they didn't cost me anything other than some gold on WoW. The equivalent of like $25
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:01:50
Like mt. Gox was?
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:47:24
I mean it was on fire for at least 5-10 minutes before I hit the pic with an extinguisher 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:02:23
Ya on a piece of paper and USB drive both in the desk that burned down
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:04:18
I didn't think I was... but yes.... yes I was
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:46:05
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:02:54
The paper was in case an emp or something that caused the USB to fail 
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:11:58
I got the BTC for like less than $30... I didn't even pay for them with money I paid wow Gold....
I don't have hundreds of dollars laying around to buy a bunch of SSDs.
I will try it though.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:39:52
I had a backup in an external hard drive... but it was next to my computer and is no longer there... like that whole part of the house 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:05:47
I've received offers as high as $10k via pm for the ssd 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:07:16
What is a toe worth? I have ten
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:39:46
Man. You are hilarious
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:39:36
ya I know its alot of money... but the BTC is peanuts to what this has done to my mom
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:07:43
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:18:13
Multiple shooting terrorist attacks in Australia in the last few years...
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:10:59
I'm going to take it to microcenter tonight.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:45:37
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:48:50
It was the equivalent of $20-$30USD AT THE TIME
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:39:45
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:02:00
thanks for that
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:05:01
I am not sure... bad wire ? 
I had it written down and saved on a usb stick on my desk... both were destroyed in the fire.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:49:09
Ya but I feel terrible... I could care less about the coins.  But it would really help my mom I think
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:54:55
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:06:51
I did.... on a USB... that was also burned in the fire.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:47:58
Ya dood
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:01:22
Ya.... but my phone was on my desk.. and is probably just as fucked as this drive.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:00:44
Ya... they didn't really touch on any of the great advice I received in my story thread a few days ago
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:07:16
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:19:34
But what if they can't fix it?
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:01:58
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:00:16
What do you mean? I was just talking about the story being made from my post two days ago
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:54:26
Why not?
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:40:22
Did u bring politics up? No. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:50:26
This is my mom and me for the past 24hours:.. she had like $6000 in the house... I don't have the heart to tell her I had $50k in btc 
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:29:05
No thank you
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:06:37
How does this make your coins more valuable?
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:52:43
Well your welcome I guess
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:06:31
I had it written down and stored on a usb. Both were on/around my desk and lost in the fire.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:46:47
Let me just check out the post history... yup he posted on the_donald and supports our president. Surely he is a racist fascist and his mothers house should burn down.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:00:27
now thats the first solid idea i've heard.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:57:04
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:46:12
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:38:15
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:45:29
It was in a drawer in the room that burned down
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:45:57
ya I'm just concerned they will steal the info I need
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:11:11
Remember when you guys had guns? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:59:56
we don't have many elephants in oklahoma.... but I get your point. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:47:49
Ya I wish I had $3k laying around
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:29:03
Yes... I thought I had a few they didn't factor in my house burning down 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:04:32
Thanks for the advice. If I find a time machine I'll be sure to use it 
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:58:51
I'd store it in a safety deposit box
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:23:00
Like most of the house I'm sure t was
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:38:07
thanks for the positivity
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:47:48
ya I traded wow gold for them the equivalent of ~$25 USD in 2011
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:31:38
OMFG IT ACTUALLY WORKS
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:43:37
This is a ssd that got torched 
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:12:56
Ya we are going to have to move the house is fucked 
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:36:19

@_date: 2017-08-04 15:01:50
I had two... both on the house
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:02:34
Ya my ties are all gone 
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:44:57
Honestly I haven't looked at it in years... all I remember right now is two of them 
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:38:59
? no troll my dood
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:28:26
Unfortunately not. I thought someone could hack that
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:28:10
every few months
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:03:48
I panicked... a side note replace your fire extinguisher frequently. Ours was as old as I am and barely put out my CPU
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:59:04
I wish bro.... I wish
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:23:56
Wow. That sounds great thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:48:21
I had offline backups in my house that burned down 
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:10:41
I had one external harddrive in a drawer that is completely fucked (assuming fire department won't allow us back in the house yet)
I also had my seed written down and on a usb... both were lost.
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:07:42
Others have said this.... my coins didn't disappear I just lost access to them
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:09:24
ya... I had it on a usb drive and written down on paper... both were in/around my desk and were lost in the fire.
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:01:14
No I grabbed it when I sprayed it with an extinguisher... you can read the story on tifu...
I panicked and grabbed the pc before I ran out.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:51:57
I'll give you half of you can fix it 
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:50:01
Thank you
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:32:07
This should be a bumper sticker 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:30:01
But I can't get my btc info
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:27:50
Oh I see... I didn't think they would even cover it
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:05:20
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:23:42
If you'll split the btc with me if u recover I'm down 
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:07:47
hmm... I called microcenter they said they have two options... one being more expensive and they send it offsite. 
But I'll try the link thanks mate.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:31:28
EMP isn't what I was planning on... rather anything that causes electrical malfunction on the usb
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:36:43
thanks for rubbing salt in the wound
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:35:32
Because I didn't think this would happen. I failed to plan 
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:11:33
I'll give it a shot 
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:30:35
I posted the story on tifu.
The CPU started the fire which spread to papers/books. I hit the CPU with a fire extinguisher and grabbed it thinking it was my only shot at saving my coins before running out of the house. 
The fire was to big for the extinguisher at that point 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:03:16
My moms policy has a $2500 cash limit don't know if that applies to btc.
I traded a guy wow gold for the coins like 7 years ago. Would an email chain be proof?
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:00:42
Noone is goign to look for it... The firedepartment told my mom its not structuraly safe... frankly from the looks of it it won't be there... it was on the second story... and there is no second story on that half of the house.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:33:05
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:40:21
Ya the whole half of the house burned I only have this because I took it with me before we ran out the house 
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:00:09
thanks... but no luck
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:39:10
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:38:48
not for a few days... the fire department won't let us back in the house yet
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:49:13
Last night 
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:53:17
Thanks man. My inbox is full of bs from ppl calling me out for being 
2) for posting on the_Donald
3) making this up
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:08:22
()_o yes...
and written down on paper next to it...
and on a usb that got torched as well.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:46:05
Twice. On paper and on a USB both were in my desk and were torched
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:39:46
LETS GO TRUMP!
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:40:42
That’s when you buy the dip
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:08:53
The last block will not be mined
@_date: 2016-09-17 23:19:10
That is how it is designed you just keep halving the block value and ultimately it will raise the price of btc 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:07:29
What happens to people that lose access to a wallet. I had a 4000 btc in 2009. Did they just disappear
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:50:36
half* gypsy
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:30:02
I don't have any of that information. It was all on a thumbdrive. I've moved 7 times since then and haven't been able to find it
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:32:32
I ended up selling the drive as is for $50000. They said it was an easy recovery and got 6 free coins 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:36:58

I don't care what says.... 
At the end of the day, this is the best gif I've seen in a while. Sure it doesn't have meta... there are no fancy animations or words... 
but god damnit it made me laugh
@_date: 2016-07-08 05:42:29
its older than fuel injectors... probably older than both of us let alone btc
@_date: 2013-10-18 05:57:55
I am working on developing a charity based coop..... 
It would be similar to ps3 foldinghome. Instead of allocating CPU processing power to research users could allocate CPU time to any charity they please. 
The client would also make accepting bitcoin donations possible. 
Anyone interested in helping shoot me a pm.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:35:08
Unless you are in the middle of a drought.
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:32:09
I am working on a program called the coin fund. It will be a two program system really. The first will be a wallet that will allow all nonprofits to accept donations of bit coins. The second will be a mining application that allocates the computers resources towards mining the coins. The generated coins will then be donated to the users nonprofit of choice. Think of the PlayStation 2 folding home application. Would you be interested in helping me develop the coin fund?
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:44:58
What about thousands, if not tens of thousands of people mining together?
