oh, so suddenly it is other nodes and not yours anymore that get fucked up by this?
[too bad i have shown that you are a liar because nodes can cope with it when they don't receive a block.](
of course they can cope with it, there could be a network timeout anytime while receiving a block.
stop talking bullshit. 
find a new argument but stop living in denial about this magically fucking up your machine for the reasons you said it would.
btcisgod had some good points. natanael raised the same ones again in more detail.
see if you can find something new or accept the scientific truth.
and most importantly stop upvoting yourself using sockpuppets instead of arguments. it doesn't change anything and makes you look like a douche.

well, not always. the hard part is getting it on the router in the first place, that totally depends on the model.

explain yourself.
if this won't work, why can't any of you name a reason?
this isn't a religion, you know? computers follow instructions and everyone can see those instructions.
[you can see some of them here.](

the index already contains everything, there is no need to update it. actually it is impossible as i already said.
the only case in which the index changes is when a fork occurs. but in that case the index is rolled back and updated using the new blocks. no need for the old ones.
blocks are only needed for a reindex, but that's not part of the discussion yet.
