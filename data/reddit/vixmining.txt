Fan freq: Yes, after installing the latest firmware my S9 now cycles frequency. I am using the new low power features so my fans don’t run that high. Now running almost 9.5TH @ 750W. Freq swings were more severe before I added  at the end of my stratum on NH. Note NH has separate stratum for ASICboost. Check to make sure you are running latest firmware. On the overview page my file system version has a Dec 5 date.

Latest firmware adds a second option “Low Power Enhanced Mode”

I’ve only been mining for about 9 months but as I understand it Nonce is basically a “start mining here” list that your pool sends to your miner. Because the S9s are so fast they exhaust the list very quickly.  By subscribing to Extra Nonce you are telling your pool to keep the list coming while keeping your mining process running. Without it the mining process reboots at the end of original list, Note: not all pools need explicit options added to the stratum address. NH does. I add  to the end of my stratum address string.

See my answer to this question. But, as I said after I upgrade 2 S9s to the latest firmware. I had similar behavior. Note latest firmware gives 2 Low Power options Low Power Mode and Low Power Enhanced Mode. I run with both option on. What do they do? Besides run with less power? Beats me. I was looking for a “ASICboost” selectable option. Does not exist. BTW Subscribing to Extra Nonce,  seems to really help suppress the frequency swings. Using an earlier version of the ASICboost enabled firmware it only gave me one low power option, as yours shows. Using that firmware I was at 14TH using 200W less. Now with the latest firmware I’m running about 9.3TH using 750W.
