People trying to predict and time the market always lose out from what i’ve seen for the past two years in crypto. Trying to analyze and predict crypto is just silly imo.

Bitcoin is a traders market right now. They fluctuate the price. They spread lambo fomos when long and fuds when short. They need the volatility to make money.

@_date: 2018-08-17 20:51:34
Sounds about right
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:55:49
WRONG. They “accepted” the bitcoin at the cash register by “their employees” at “their store” using “their POS system” or whatever. Doesn’t matter if the bitcoin from my wallet isn’t transferred directly into their corporate account, instead converted into usd by BAKKT or whoever and sent to whatever account as whatever currency of their preference. 
From a consumer’s point of view, they don’t give two shits about what the vendors do with the bitcoin as long as they’re able to receive goods or services in return using bitcoin. And that by definition is “accepting bitcoin”.

That’s just the nature of the market tho. We’re in a bear market, bears are everywhere shorting the crap out of btc spreading all sorts of fud and bs. Can’t wait to hear the sound of bears getting rekt like they did 2 weeks ago when btc spiked up to $8,400.

U walk into a starbucks and pay coffee with bitcoin. How is that not accepting bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-04 00:52:36
Should have effected it the moment it came out or even on just rumors or speculations. But nothing seems to effect the price in positive way in this bear market.

Why so bearish?
@_date: 2018-08-04 02:11:29

So many bears everywhere, i guess that makes sense in a bear market. I personally think $50k by 2020 is EXTREMELY bearish. More like $200k by 2020. And yes, i have a crystal ball, hah!

Traders that shorted, and there are lots.
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:29:57
Exchanges don’t care about btc prices. The more transactions volumes, the more money they make, up or down is irrelevant.

WRONG AGAIN. If you walk into a Starbucks and it has "We accept Bitcoin" sticker on their cash register. They are "ACCEPTING" bitcoin despite what goes on behind it how many third person it goes through or it gets converted into a whatever currency. As a consumer, they ARE accepting bitcoin, get it?
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:57:59
Except that guy happens to be a starbucks employee who uses starbucks pos systems to “accept” the bitcoin.

In the beginning of 2017, people that were calling $5,000 bitcoin by the end of the year were ridiculed. Then $10,000, then it hit $20,000 and NOT a single person called it. Anything can happen with bitcoin.

Obviously you're clueless. There are studies done by big institutes(JPM, Goldman Sachs, Charles Schwab) for over decades that show hodlers gain the most and traders trying to ride highs and sell the lows make the least. In fact, 95% of traders lose substantially and every trader reading this will agree. Again, nobody can tell the highs and lows, NOBODY.

You must be a noob... there was a day in bitcoin about 2 months ago before the hard fork when bitcoin went from $2500 to $1800 in a single day and people panic sold like crazy only for it to go right back up to $2,500 the very next day. There was a meme going around here in this sub of a dog melting with: "I sold at $1,800". Anyway, this kind of thing happens pretty often in crypto. People that don't panic sell and hodl gets rewarded heavily.

Bitcoin can drop 30% in a day and shoot up 60% the next. Nobody can tell the bottom or the top, nobody. Ride the highs and the lows and you will be rewarded heavily.

Thank the Blockstream and Core team. Slow confirmation and ridiculously high transaction fees resulted MANY merchants dropping bitcoin as a form of payment. At one point few weeks ago, the fee was $10 on a $30 transaction or something like that.

Although i agree 100% this is far from reality... bitcoin is way too saturated with traders looking to make a quick buck and only way they can achieve this through volatility and they will do whatever means to keep the market volatile.

Highly unlikely to see another dip like this anytime soon. There will always be small pull backs followed by growths but big dips like this done come very often. Ebvery few months at the least. Last dip like this was in July.

You don't have to be an ANALyst or a dev to know over a thousand different coins have tried to out compete bitcoin and guess what, none have succeeded and bitcoin is bigger than ever. Yes, one day there might be a coin that can over take bitcoin's marketshare but not anytime soon and bitcoin will certainly worth way more than $100,000 in not too distayfuture.

Nobody knows because it hasn’t happened yet and Bitcoin is unlike any asset or currency we have ever encountered. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:33:07
Get the fuck out of here fudder. Had a one day off good day in 7 months and still fudders like this pretending to have good intentions. Get the fuck outta here.
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:21:28
You are not the Nostradamus. You don't know shit about what bitcoin price will be, THAT IS A FACT. You're just spreading fud pretending to have good intentions and acting like you're the fucking nostradamus. YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT.

Do the opposite of the news. If news declares bitcoin dead; buy. If news declares bitcoin a new ath; sell and you will be successful af.

Make sense to sell the houses now at the peak of this financial bubble and invest into bitcoin which has seen a major correction which has potential of 10-100X returns.
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:17:34
This is what’s truely important and not the daily fluctuations in price.
@_date: 2018-07-30 03:35:25
Same, this person retarded or what?

Why is that tho?

That's exactly what i mean. Are you saying this is coinbasr limit and not Chase's?
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:51:29
Yep, using coinbase. Thanks for the info!

Bitcoin is huge in South Korea. EVERYONE knows about it. 30% of ETH volume is done by this tiny nation.

@_date: 2017-07-30 03:13:24
Agreed. Don't fall for the trolls trying to spread fud to buy some cheaper bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:42:01
Idiots like u r the reason why bitcoin aint going up. Instead of wanting to go up thousands, your pitty ass wish it to go down so u can make few bucks here and there.
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:23:32
No massive hack... It's a small user acc info breach, not bitcoins. And the hackers were able to steal about $800k worth of bitcoins. No where near "massive". 
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:38:19
Why not just hope for btc to continue rise and everyone gets rich instead of hoping for it to fall morons?
@_date: 2017-07-02 05:28:31
Every body, stfu and sign the damn thing. It'll only help bitcoin to mainstream.
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:49:25
This chart doesn’t make sense. The end of the graph should be showing MUCH lower bitcoin price. Right now it’s showing around $8,000 btc and yet the date is showing end of 2018.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:34:12

Ok, so it’s just your own opinion, got it.
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:09:48
We’ll just wait and see how bitcoin will perform during next crisis won’t we? 
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:56:12
Bitcoin is BETTER than gold and has NEVER been through a financial crisis so YOU or I DON'T KNOW how it's going to play out. Again, everything you say is a "SPECULATION" based on your little head. What don't you understand about this? And if you don't believe that bitcoin is digital gold or yet, better than gold, you have no business owning a bitcoin. Go to this video i posted earlier and educate yourself why Bitcoin is better than gold:
And you keep saying "NOBODY BELIEVES" bitcoin is digital gold. 
Here is thousands of articles that prove you wrong:
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:29:05
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:38:23
But you dont know how bitcoin will play out during the next financial crisis. No one does. You can say your opinions, guesses and assumptions all day long but that doesn’t make it true. 
People are calling bitcoin “digital gold” and  bitcoin was created to prevent financial crisi like back in 2008.

Based on what you're saying, the center of green dot is at $7,000. Still much higher than current $4,000 price. And based on what you're saying, Bitcoin never hit $20,000 in this graph. The ath orange dot is somewhere in the middle of $10,000 and $20,000. This chart doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:26:17
Educate yourself before acting like you know it all with your big head:
@_date: 2018-12-09 02:09:53
It’s the bears trolling for price go down so their shorts won’t get rekt. Thats what bear matket is all about. It will continue until all the panic sellers are completely out of the market and price won’t go any lower. That’s when we’ll hit the bottom and market will flip with a massive short squeeze. When it happens, it’ll happen fast. Can’t wait to see the bears get rekt.
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:38:59
Not necessarily... this chart is showing around $8,000 btc. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:12:57
Again, you don’t know how bitcoin will do during financial crisis because it has never happened yet. Bitcoin has all the attributes of gold and more.
Again, you’re free to speculate all you want doesn’t make it valif. And again, it’s just your personal “speculation”. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:45:16
This guy gets it
@_date: 2018-12-01 23:51:54
How is that $6,000? It’s no where near middle ($5,000).

Traders lose money in the long run. I've seen a few bitcoin hodlers become millionaires over the years but never seen or heard of a trader becoming one.
