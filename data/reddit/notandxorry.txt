Bitcoin does not solve the fundamental human problem of greed. If bitcoin was in the place of the current monetary policy there would still be widespread economic inequality. People who have bitcoin vs. people who don't. 
The good thing about bitcoin is that it is taking some power away from the centralised control. Whether that will work out is a question for the future.

It's not blackjack though, it's it's own thing. No one knows what's going to happen and everybody's doing their own thing.

Why would people 'invest' in crypto? There is no product. It will only be a speculative bet. It shouldn't be considered an investment especially by people who want to see it succeed.

Yes, and they can fine you and they'll make an image anyway. Absolutely crazy.
