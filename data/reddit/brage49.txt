Hey, you guys want to buy some cheap bitcoins? Im about to buy 100$ of BTC so the price will probably crash soon like it always does after i buy
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:56:14
Im a holder no mather what. I wish there where more stupid people to panic sell so i can snatch up more for cheap during the flashsales

it cant? it has litteraly done that since it was first launched... yes, 1m sounds hairy AF but i believe it should be possible given time and if the geoppolitics plays out the right (or wrong) way

Probably a sneaky way to make it seem more legal to give back money for an old price, while they keep the rest

dont you post this. you will jinx it

Someone is buying a fuckton of btc today in bulk. Thats gotta be the reason for it to spike in like one sec
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:14:30
Good luck, for both your and ours sake
@_date: 2019-08-15 21:54:05
For once i actualy bought the dip!
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:09:43
Didn't even flinch when the price crashed yesterday. My only thought was time to buy some sweet sub 10k btc
@_date: 2019-08-29 09:00:31
Everyone in this subreddit is either totally optimistic expecting bitcoins to moon the next day, or awaiting Armageddon tomorrow depending on if the prise swings a couple of bucks either way. There is simply no innbetween here.

Wish my workplace would accept it. Although, i once took payment in btc privately from a customer that forgot his card
@_date: 2019-08-13 23:22:03
I for my part are going to burn them on an BMW E36 M3
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:18:29
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:19:52
One part of me hopes that this is the big push, another part hopes it will crash down again so i can hoard more

Amen brother! The sadest thing that use the enviroment to tax plane seats extra, in norway where there is huge distances between almost everything and rail coverage is a sham. Godt valg!

Im from 18 hours later. Its a carnage/perfect buying time  depending on how you see it. Im in the latter category
@_date: 2019-08-15 05:16:06
Its shopping time...
@_date: 2019-12-19 00:39:31
Hahaha, sucks that i had to withraw some bitcoin yesterday to play rent. Oh well
@_date: 2019-09-22 22:11:53
Basically what i see when other people starts naming the graphs fancy stuff
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:38:04
Nice nice.
@_date: 2019-09-22 23:49:45
I thought it opened 50 mins ago. That explains why the price remained more or less static.
@_date: 2019-09-26 07:17:58
please crash more so i can get even more bang for my buck when buying more btc
