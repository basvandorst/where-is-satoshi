There are deceiving, cheating in this .
Why not warn of deposit after hack and stop deposit and leaving customers deposit more and more ?
I think that was intentional to increase the BTCs deposited at the site .
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:52:30
why they leave the customers deposit BTC after hack? And they blocked withdrawals for the same period!
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:59:49
You do not sleep like me
 what about  bitfinex coin ?
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:20:38
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:14:08
Do you remember what happened in May 2015 when stolen 1500 BTCs?
And then the loss of 0.5% Is this true?
This means that the total of BTC at this time is 300000BTC
This was more than a year 
I think that now you have more than one million BTC and that the loss will not exceed 15%
Why are not explicitly declared total BTC and reassure customers?
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:26:56
How do you know that?
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:44:53
You must be aware that there is a big mistake on your part , No alarm that the deposit is stopped while withdraw stopped at the same time. I went to copy my deposit address from my account after the hack and i did not see any alert message or warning , there is deception , so In fact our BTC did not exist at the time of the hack , The same thing applies to BTC that have been withdraw out successfully before the hack.
It is not logical that the confiscation of funds were not originally existed at the time of theft We also did not know that there are a steal!
Please discuss this and take a fair and logical decision
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:15:46
what about this 
someone ask you 
Can you confirm these funds are being moved under Bitfinex's control?
and your answer is
Yes, we are moving these coins to our control.
your account now has 82414.1146788BTC
I will repeat my calculations again now
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:24:02
How will the settlement BTC balances through other balances?
they definitely will be buying a large number of BTC to compensate for the deficit
This will be done with the USD
And on the sale other coins in the site to buy BTC
certainly This will affect the prices
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:05:43
And why is a good idea if you intend to open the site already today?
It's not in your intention is to open the site in the near future so it is seems a good idea for you
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:46:21
when ?
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:09:31
How a period of 6 hours we have to wait? This idea will like to them If they do not think of open the site today
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:00:38
14BTC and 28000$
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:59:51
According to what I understood it would not be allowed to withdraw and deposit in the beginning
But what will happen to my deposit, which I've done after the hack?
There was no warning when stopped deposit
I log in to my account and copy my deposit  address and deposit my BTC
While the withdrawal of the site was stopped
Is not this fraud? Why did not you tell us to stop the deposit?
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:52:56
how can i know ? if after or before?
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:39:56
Now the loss of 36%
We will get this of bfx token
If bfx token have collapsed by 50% we will get 18% (50% of 36)
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:17:35
I think that they have nearly one million Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:03:09
what you see at your account ? :D
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:19:15
After the hack , I went go into my account and copy my adress deposit and then sent BTC to it.
I did not see any warning that the deposit is stopped or there is a hack.
Is this not deceiving ? Why they not warn customers immediately after the news of the hack and stop the deposit ? why they leave the customers deposit BTC ?
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:21:30
please answer
How do we know that 119K BTC lost was equal to 36% of total deposits?
Can you list the total number of
BTC,LTC,ETH and USD that users had deposited.
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:07:24
i love BFX and Bitfinex :)
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:54:13
I want to answer this question , 
Why not warn us after the hack ?
We've deposit after several hours of the hack and there was enough time for warning through the deposit page or delete the page fully.
But this did not happen until website closing time.
Instead of apologizing to us about this big mistake and indemnify us as well, because what happened was not because of the hack, but because of you.
If you have a warning in deposit page filing this will not happen.
And another question,
How can you just think of the money were not present at the time of the theft just because they are with you now?
Can you request the money that was on the site before hack and their owners succeeded in withdrawal ?
Give priority to the owners of the deposits after the hack before everything because this is their right.
Or at least issue decision to reassured them.
I opened a ticker after the deposit and this was their response
"We are experiencing an issue with our deposits. Our team is working on fixing it as we speak.
Apologies for the inconvenience. We will credit your funds as soon as possible.
Kind regards,
Ninel Bitfinex Support Team support "
In fact, they was not working on fixing deposit , but stopped it and allow us to deposit without any warning to collect the largest possible number of BTC
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:47:03
They can think about the distribution of losses on the BTC balance  existing at the time of the hack
But can not think of the other coin or USD and funds that deposited after the hack
This deception
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:49:47
why they leave the customers deposit BTC after hack? And they blocked withdrawals for the same period!
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:18:45
will your team work tomorrow and Sunday?
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:58:26
You are leaning towards a socialized loss scenario among bitcoin balances and active loans to BTCUSD positions. then look at how to compensate customers And you are leaning towards that you could give people tokens that will be replaced. Is this true?
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:51:53
but you said before hours
"I'm pretty sure we'll get it up today. We made a lot of progress yesterday and our team is quite confident it'll go up today."

We are currently in an ongoing process of restoring limited functionality in a secure environment, with full functionality coming afterwards in progressive stages. The first step is bringing the site online and allowing users to login and view the state of their accounts. Note that initially trading, deposits, withdrawals, and other core site functionality will be disabled. 
To accommodate the relaunch, all withdrawals, open orders, and open funding offers will be canceled. Furthermore, in order to compute losses for relevant parties, settlement must occur in the affected accounts. Margin positions for all pairs will be settled and closed using the following prices, representing the midpoint of the bid and ask on August 2, 2016 at 18:00:00 UTC: 
BTCUSD:	604.06000000 
ETHUSD:	10.19050000 
ETHBTC:	0.01689900 
ETCUSD:	2.83700000 
ETCBTC:	0.00471495 
LTCUSD:	3.75180000 
LTCBTC:	0.00621295 
Further announcements about the next steps of the relaunch will be posted as progress is made. All significant changes to feature availability will be announced in advance. We will strive to keep you as informed as we can.

@_date: 2016-08-07 00:16:28
Common law, which would apply in HK and BVI, states that all equal creditors must be treated equal. Since you signed up to the same terms that I and every one else did, the court will decide that all assets are to be distributed equally. That is exactly what BFX are doing now, only they save us time, hassle and legal fees. But if you want to litigate just for fun, go for it. You are not extra special because you happend to speculate in ETH.
