Free speech =/= censorship. You’re arguing as if they said “this seems like it’s against free speech”, which they didn’t. It’s against the principle of free speech imo, but obviously it’s not against government protected free speech since these are private companies. It is literally censorship though, private company or not, and I’m not a fan of Info Wars or Alex Jones.

I never said private companies weren’t allowed censorship? Did you actually read my comment?

God you’re dense. The first thing you say is “no this isn’t censorship”, I reply “yes it is by definition, censorship”, then  you say “well it is censorship but private companies are allowed to do that!”— which I never said they couldn’t! Just because I understand how the law works and the rights of private companies doesn’t mean I have to agree or disagree with their actions. That’s literally all I said.

This isn’t from the referral program though. This is just for people who used a .edu email to sign up for the site a few years ago. Anyone who did so got a free $10 in bitcoin.

This might be the dumbest conversation I’ve had on the internet. Again, not a fan of infowars, except they are a great meme. Spreading misinformation and abhorrent views is not something I enjoy partaking in personally.

You could argue that letting a net worth like yours just sit there is a stupid waste of money as well. Lambos just look cool and are also probably incredibly fun to drive. If you have wild amounts of money and like awesome cars, why wouldn’t you try one? It’s an experience very few people get to have.

Probably because their net worth is ridiculously more than the cost of a Lamborghini.
