Different alts do different things. Smart contracts are a paradigm shift for how money works. Anonymous alts hide txns better than bitcoin. Some alts are geared for IoT micro transactions. Other alts just have better tech than bitcoin and people buy them to hedge against the possibility that the lightning network never happens/isn’t as fast as people hope. And then there’s a lot of small alts that have highly specific functions, like paying content creators or betting on video games etc. And then there are alts that really have no purpose other than to fund a startup, and those alts boom sometimes but I wouldn’t invest in them

Yup and if I could build a foundation to my house in the clouds, that would be really stabilizing for the second floor

Ethereum handles over 1m txn/day, Bitcoin cash is at 127k/day currently. Just for the record.

Hopefully that ETC is a typo and u meant ETH

Microsoft is interested in it, not sure why you think its a scam. It’s a tangle not a block chain, which is a cool tech. When IoT gets bigger, something like iota will be needed, but it has competitors. I don’t know enough to say if it is overpriced, but my rash impression is that you’re paying a mid-development price for an early-development coin. Not that fundamentals seem to matter these days haha

There's a reason why Argentina has a huge black market for exchanging pesos to US dollars. At times it's literally double the official exchange rate

People buy bitcoin and people buy drugs, but not for the same reasons. You're underthinking it now.

Bank of China is a state owned enterprise, not a regulatory arm of the government. I wouldn't read much into it. If the Swiss government banned a certain type of airplane, a Swiss-government owned airline would have to comply...

Everybody on this sub is an economist and now a lawyer too, I see. The law of insider trading is actually kinda complex. Your post title is about as accurate as saying "if was identifiable, he would be guilty of defamation"

If it were illegal, fewer people in China would buy it. Less demand means a lower price. Don't overthink it.

Venmo has zero fees. Alipay in China pays you interest sometimes, and people actually use it--there are QR codes on food vendor carts owned by old ladies.
Bitcoin's advantage is that it's decentralized? Except... people are working on improving it. Doesn't seem that decentralized...

The cost of building your own blockchain is way cheaper than buying tons of bitcoin, and if you're a bank you have the assets to make a dollar-backed crypto... so this article doesn't make sense.

That's pretty rare in cities, but it happens once in a while in rural areas. To your point about the rule of law: sure, some Chinese people will continue to trade bitcoin regardless, but most probably won't, unless they can find a trustworthy exchange that doesn't require ID. You'd have to use a VPN too, and (idk) but there might a risk of your VPN provider monitoring your traffic and stealing your coins. Then it becomes the classic situation of calling the cops because somebody stole your illegal substance.

why do people use coinbase? fees are so crazy compared to gemini

Sounds like your Spanish teacher was white

There's a very common scam in China where you pay a builder to build a house for you and then they run away. It works because people pay with bags full of paper money. It would also work with bitcoin.
I see bitcoin as gold with extra features. But I wouldn't pay for a house with gold--that's asking for trouble.

ICO ban definitely didn't cause the crash, but I suppose one could make the argument that the comment isn't stupid if you see increased Chinese regulation of crypto as a potentially threatening trend. Not my take on it, but not entirely unreasonable
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:06:47
Hey thanks for the long post but I already knew everything you said. People talk about bitcoin being decentralized in multiple senses.
Btw you use GRE vocab words in a really unnatural way. Good luck getting a date with a female interlocutor.

you might want to google around a bit about price elasticity, demand, and substitute products.

Alipay has been around since 2004 and you've been a redditor for 1 week lol

if you're trying to sell and there are no buyers, your computer says "okay, how about I sell at a slightly lower price". (if you buy/sell at market price rather than limit)

Tether's market cap is:      $391,738,950  
Bitcoin's market cap is: $71,442,290,984
Even if all tether is made out of thin air, I don't see it affecting bitcoin's price much. It's like 5%.
