Is it possible that the dates are off for the coinbase import? E.g. if in my coinbase wallet a buy transaction shows for the 10th than in bitcoin.tax it shows for the 14th (because coinbase needs a few days to execute the ACH?)

Fantastic, thanks I was using it wrong.
I'm a little confused by the different products offered and the pricing. If I buy the 2016 Premium can I import 2014 and 2015 data and download taxact for 2015 ?

Thanks for posting here, really appreciate it. Do you support turbotaxonline.com ? Then you just won a customer ..
When I tried to use your website it would only import transactions from my files for 2015 and ignore 2014 txs. The 2014 txs are important to calculate the cost basis and long term gains / losses. Am I using it wrong?
You support importing coinbase buy, sell and merchant payouts. But what if I made a purchase and bought something for bitcoin? I don't think those txs show up in that file?
Do you support importing the LibraTax csv format so I can move my txs over to you? (That is in case you support turbotaxonline)
Thanks again, really appreciate what you are doing for the bitcoin community.

Thanks I will give TaxACT a try, the website didn't load for me a few days ago but now it does again, what about this issue, it's keeping me from using your service for now:
