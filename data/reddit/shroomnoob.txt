I live in a household with four other people. 
We have a chores rotation, a minimum standard for useful cleanliness, and an understanding that we will either share in the purchase of trash bags and such, or pay whoever buys the trash bags a portion. 
These sorts of situations arise all the time. 
[The commons live in the space of externalities, and will likely not go away in the foreseeable future.](
Granted, the commons has a tendency to expand beyond that space. 
However, as long as externalities remain, we will need some kind of publicly funded activity. 
The high-minded and the virtuous are willing to back those which serve the greater good.
