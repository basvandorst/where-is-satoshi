**HITBC is stealing money from everyone!!!**
What a shame. **This is what HITBC sends me after all that?** What a joke! Why don't you send me back my $12,000 and kick me off your system...BUT IM SURE HITBTC would rather steal my hard earned money, and everyone else's.
**WHAT HITBC IS ASKING IS IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S JUST AN EXCUSE FOR THEM TO STEAL MONEY!**
