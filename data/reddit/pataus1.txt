I have always read that Roger Ver is an eloquent speaker so I went and looked at some of his lectures and I beg to differ.  He is somewhat awkward and nervous.  Not horrible, just not eloquent.

Even the most skilled actors can hide their true nature only for a time.  If they keep talking, the real persona will start to reveal itself.  What has happened to Roger is that people have seen this side of him in the past but he was able to suppress it enough to where it didn't hurt him.  However, now that he is communicating more and more, people are starting to see the real deal.  He is not as careful to hide his true nature but his ego now is totally out of control.  Look at his behavior after he launched BCash as opposed to before.

Andreas is not a prophet but he does have vision and amazing insights.
We gotta calm down on this terminology folks.  It's starting to get silly.

No regulations are needed from any outside entity!  This is what happens in a true marketplace.  Unethical and immoral behavior is exposed and better actors step into the void to create a more ideal exchange, coin or whatever.  This market is still in its infancy so we have to reward the good actors and their platforms and move from the bad actors.  Stop with the "we need regulation" talk.  If you need regulations the banks are there for you.
