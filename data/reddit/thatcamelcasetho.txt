Javascript can satisfy the needs of a web developer, if not a bit clunkier than an alternative could.
Could the same be said for Bitcoin versus Ethereum? The use cases are too different for one to hold out the other from the market.
There will be competition on all fronts. 
How do you think Bitcoin will respond to the added pressure from other coins?

Why does Bitcoin have a higher USD transaction volume than any other coin?

As far as I know, proof of work is condemned for its impact on pollution and more specifically, energy usage. If I recall, Bitcoin mining in 2017 used more energy than the entirety of New Zealand.
It is not sustainable, especially with the hopes of mass adoption. An alternative must be made, and currently, it seems like Proof of Stake is next.

What do you see Bitcoin having that others do not?
When I look at altcoins, I see progress and vision that Nakamoto did not have. Not to blame him at all, but it is silly to think that no one else can improve something.
Bitcoin is far from perfect. In fact, every cryptocurrency has faults.
Why do you hold Bitcoin in higher value than others when they are taking steps to make cryptocurrency more applicable to the real word. As for a specific example, take ethereum. They hold different uses, Bitcoin and Ethereum, but it'd be silly to think that Ethereum can't dethrone Bitcoin in terms of use cases.
What do you think?

How do you mean? If Bitcoin has a higher market capitalization, it holds that it should be transacting higher amounts, no? 
Most people who have heard of cryptocurrency have heard of only Bitcoin which would be what they invest in.
When you have more participants, it would hold that more money is transacted?
Am I misunderstanding?

Why do you think cryptocurrency is being blown to the moon right now?
It is almost entirely because of the promise of usability. No one will spend money on anything with a useful return. What you're talking about is a pyramid scheme, where there is no usable value and only the reliance on more money somehow flowing in. It will not flow in if there are no use cases.

Unhackable, no. In the case of PoS, there is very little a hacker could do. Based upon a system whereby the majority coin holders decide what transactions are verified seems to be an elegant solutions. The verifiers would be motivated to only verify the truly correct transaction or else trigger a hard fork where they would lose their money.
I believe I'm understanding PoS correctly with what I wrote above.
What are the weaknesses that PoS has that PoW does not?

I'm missing the comparison there. I'm sorry. I'm not really familiar with why javascript was chosen.

What the is the difference you are seeing between a digital scarcity and a real world one?
We are all investing in a 'fake' asset, that is largely intangible. How can we value real world scarcity over digital scarcity when they are one in the same concering digital assets?

Bitcoin is not at the forefront when it comes to transaction volume. When other coins are able to handle higher volume with lower wait times and fees, what is the benefit of Bitcoin?
Already Ethereum has crossed over 1 million transactions with almost none in queue.

Linear scaling was only a temporary fix. Sharding and the Raiden network are being developed, and implementable within the near future. Linear scaling will in no way be a permanent solution.
How do you view these solutions versus Segwit?

Bitcoin only sets the curve for others to follow for now. It controls 40% of the market cap of all cryptocurrency, but when the rest catch up (e.g. Ethereum, Ripple, etc.), there will be less weight attached to Bitcoin's price movements. It is only in the early stages where the market is unfairly weighted that one coin can decide for the entire market where the price will go.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:27:21
Absolutely. Within almost every cryptocurrency, there is a finite amount of coins. Do you not view this as a scarce resource?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:31:20
What changes are you referencing? The hard forks have happened with a lot of major coins, Bitcoin included. Change is what allows for stronger, more secure, and versatile crypo assets. 
Can you go into more detail what you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:21:26
With other coins working on their own scaling solutions, do you think that a momentary victory is worth an eventual slide into second or third place?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:19:00
I don't think you're accurately portraying other cryptos. As well, you're not addressing the exceedingly long transaction times and fees that Bitcoin has.
What can you tell me about these issues specifically?

I cannot imagine that electricity prices would remain stable once it reaches such large market. As well, the difficulty of mining would only increase. Mining would lose profitability, and then, who would mine?

How is Ethereum centralized? I'm not sure what you're referencing.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:29:53
Having a higher market capitalization skews the amount of money being transacted in favor of Bitcoin. It will not stay this way for long.
How do you see Bitcoin handling the added competition and eventual relinquishing of almost half the market?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:19:41
As far as I know, Ethereum has handled the highest transaction count over 24 hours with over 1.1 million. Am I misunderstanding what you mean by demand?
