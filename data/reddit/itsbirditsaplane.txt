You've not made any points. Only person who has, I've talked to directly.

Hey, Btcmint, I own a small website that assists people in purchasing bitcoins.
I'm interested in speaking with you about a partnership where we could possible trade links, ect. Dual-Promotion if that makes any sense.
Please shoot me an email at cerviaone (((((((at))))))))) gmail.com

Why not employ more developers and get it done sooner? In the bitcoin world, a lot can happen in 2-3 weeks.
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:20:32
This, is an amazing idea. 
I like it. Time to start developing :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:12:29
I don't think he will, but I think it gives enough people sufficient information to hunt down the lil bitch themselves if they where also victims.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:24:32
That's been a LOONG time ago in the world of internet marketing. lol.

Speaking of MtGox being offline off and on, and them no longer allowing withdrawls via mtgox USD codes, anyone know who can exchange .73 bitcoin to 70$ Liberty reserve, or even an exchange company? wmxchange is low balling their exchange rates right now, and wm-center is offering me 31 bucks. Ugh. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:48:46
Fucking dumbass. 
Maybe include some information about what your order id is? 
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:09:56
Because bitcoin has never moved 200% in 24 hours...
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:26:28
And this is why bitcoin is deflating. No liquidity. Keep hoarding dem bitcoins and you'll end up losing out. Sell now, and bitcoin could stable out. Granted everyone needs to have that mindset...

Site works, unless you're unable to register?
I run all payments through a payment network, which protects me from fraud (up to 5000$ worth anyways).
What kind of details would you like? There's a TON more information on the inside of the site after registration.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:17:13
There's a method, not sure what it's called, but if you've got enough funds, you can win A LOT of money with the 5050 chance one. 
Basically, you double your bid every time you lose, once you win you start over again. If you've only got 1-2 btc, do bids of 0.01
EDIT: Martingale strategy.

If anyone has any question about their service, their email is cerviasoftwaresystems ((AT)))) gmail.com
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:33:17
Cervia isn't malware, infact it's being contracted by Google right now.
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:47:38
It's not like they could do anything about it in the first place. lol. I love how they actually speculated that Bitcoin could be regulated.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:19:52
seems legit
@_date: 2013-04-18 09:15:23
Get something good rolling, and I'll give you a server to run this on.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:03:19
Added information directly on the front page.
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:09:11
ah. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:52:26
I'd never start with 15BTC, lol. Considering that's worth 1500, i dont bet that much.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:03:06
What would you suggest to implement, add, or change that would change your opinion?
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:37:22
Thank you for the feedback :) I'll implement an information page in a couple minutes.

Hey there Paul, 
My name is Kyle Collins, and I am a serial entrepreneur/SEO'r/Developer.
I've been interested in Bitcoin for a long while now, and I'd love for it to stable out and become a viable currency. 
I think you are just the person I've been looking for to support. I'd like to discuss a bit more about what motivates you, and possibly fund your project (along with any other developers you may want to bring on board) and ideas.
Within my business I usually don't back projects with more than 10 thousand, but I've got 70 thousand in reserves, and you may just be getting my support. 
Please shoot me contact request on skype so that we can communicate futher. (CerviaDeveloper)
