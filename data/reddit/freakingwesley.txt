Vertcoin's one-click miner is ridiculously easy to set up and the community will be glad to help you out on their Discord or subreddit.

Isn't 2x literally changing the value of the block size and that's it? At least before the fork.

You could make everyone in this thread a potential millionaire and it wouldn't make a dent to your wallet. (Do it!)
On the off chance that this is legit, congratulations on your pension.

Why do we get continuous 'SegWit transactions are rising' threads, but nobody wants to talk about it crashing?

Thanks for asking the questions I've been carrying with me for weeks. Still trying to grasp this subreddit drama and the underlying 1x-2x discussion. It's difficult when both parties are slinging shit, whether one is warranted or not.

Mt. Gox is definitely an (extreme) example as to why we need to avoid centralization. I think there's a balance that can be stricken in maybe ten years, however.

I'm having difficulty wording my thoughts. I'm thinking of an abstraction layer, similar to the front-end of your online bank account, to allow people to deposit, withdraw and transfer bitcoins with relative ease. There are already similar solutions, though the necessary steps to a full-fledged account and relative difficulty make it non-ideal still.
Another user brings up the concern of decentralization though. I guess I am thinking to easily about this.

I recently purchased something with bitcoin through a service called Mollie. Using it was incredibly easy. Do you consider solutions like this centralization? 
I agree in that bitcoin should stay as decentralized as possible.

How many people know and understand the technology that allows them to make transactions with current currency? All that's missing is a front-end/translation layer for people that aren't into the development of Bitcoin to use it. 
Bitcoin has to be trusted and stable before everyone else will want to use it. I don't doubt that if it takes off, these issues will be handled with relative ease.
