A third party would be nice, only 5% more in the polls and there is a third party in the debates.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:12:04
Then why do they keep calling bcash bitcoin?  You think they would want to distance themselves.  Or maybe they are just so busy with development fixing these issues, judging by the number of commits on their github
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:10:05
Bad math
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:03:44
Absolutely not.  You are connected with multiple nodes.  You are confusing routing with funding.
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:45:38
0 payments fail.  Just those channels are closed.  You need to research how the states work
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:32:01
You are spreading FUD, all your stupid graph is based on false assumptions.  Like i said even if half the nodes go offline NO transactions would fail!  None. Im not going to spend any more time trying to cure you of your ignorance.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:12:32
No. Something that is legacy is outdated and no longer supported.  So bitcoin cash is legacy.  Again core is a group of develpers that has NOTHING to do with bitcoins name. You are a concern troll huh?
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:44:08
WTF is bitcoin core! Are you referring to the desktop client? Bitcoin is bitcoin.  Btrash is just that no bitcoin

@_date: 2018-01-27 17:10:35
Yes and it reroutes to other nodes.  Thats the point it is decentralized so stop spreading FUD

This is a trustless third party.  Have you even researched it at all?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:30:23
So companies use bitcoin too.  Its distributed routing, and proof of stake so if LN rules are broken those companies would lose their capital.  Point is you dont have to trust them
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:05:53
No its not its a fact trezor writes the base software for both
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:28:59
It definitely posted this reply under the wrong comment lol. Someone was shilling a service to put small amounts of money into bitcoin.  Personally i believe bitcoin has the best recipe by far, no one else has the proof of work network or network effect.  The others are important to develop new features but nothing that cant be put on bitcoin eventually.   Its a big gamble to mess with altcoins.  Would not recommend 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:17:30
This! I can’t thank you enough Andreas.  Hopefully a little bitcoin for your stash helps. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:43:30
Interest only applies to fiat. The nodes make money off the fees.  So that would be their motivation right?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:07:05
Donated.  Thank you Andreas love your videos. Truely a brilliant mind. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:44:31
Did you not imply that you need high capital requirements and therefore only companies can use it?  Beacuse thats not how LN works. Those words mean important thingsand are all characteristics of the LN that protect against the type of risk you are describing 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:12:51
Switch to log. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:36:16
There is no such thing as interest in bitcoin.  Its tx fees

People who tend to worry this much about it are generally new to the space itself.  Not saying anything against new people but years of bitcoin desensitizes you quickly. I cant tell you how many “serious threats” have not effected bitcoin in the lomg run. Also, I’d like to see the post focus on technical details about how futures might effect bitcoin not basic price speculation.  We care more about the technology, the price follows.
TL/DR: Don’t worry, or maybe you are over invested?

Yes.  And what im saying is there are other reasons to use bitcoin other than its value at any given time.  No one says you have to use it as savings.  It is a trustless network for sending value directly between people anywhere in the world, almost instantly without a government or company inolvled.

There is a company that is doing this quite well.  They have an excellent iOS wallet called "Pheeva" that I have been using.  They call it "CoinID" and you can send bitcoin with a text addresses in a closed ecosystem, for instance my CoinID is "will".  You can still use normal bitcoin addresses as well.
You can download the wallet for free and reserve your CoinID at

@_date: 2017-05-31 01:38:10
No problem. Its my understanding that the chances of a chain split are very low for the following reasons: 
-USAF/BIP148 only activates after 80% nodes (people running the full software supporting the network) are signaling for it so it eliminates this risk
-If BU ever gets big enough which I find unlikely, if the core chain gets longer again, BU will go back to core consensus rules
It's mostly just fear spreading by one side or another and an excuse used by people/organizations that fear bitcoin to scare them away
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:59:33
They already forked that's pretty split. And if you are a beginner stay far away from altcoins link Ethereum you won't get better returns in the long term. Smart contracts can be integrated even without BIP148 and are automatically available with it.  Once that's integrated bye bye ethereum, hello rootstock

1-Electrum is fine, the important part is to have your private keys in your possession (always important in bitcoin, you want to be your bank, not someone else, and if you have your keys you control your money. If you have a lot consider getting a hardware wallet like Trezor so malware can't steal your coin. Do you really care a lot? Run a full node on your computer signaling BIP148
2-Your coins will remain on both the chains. You can spend either of them using your private keys.  Because now there are twice as many coins, the price will probably go down.  Eventually one one chain will may get longer and win out.
3-if it fails nothing happens. That's one of the great features about bitcoin is that it is really hard to change. The innovation around Segwit (like lightning network) will not be implemented on bitcoin.  A hard fork will only happen if enough people, regardless of BIP148/UASF(user activated soft fork) decide that they want to change the rules of the consensus algorithm (one rule is the 1MB limit) and run software (nodes) that have different rules (previously this has been attempted as Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, etc. but it never seems to work. 
So don't worry too much grab some popcorn and hodl.  It's a fun ride, trust me.   Oh and please please please avoid altcoins unless you like gambling
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:44:57

@_date: 2017-06-09 15:31:01
Sure.  There is an established crypto currency with a majority hash rate.  The hash rate, directly equatable to the security of the coin, does not come close with the others.  At this time this is bitcoin. It has a fixed supply, this is incredibly important, other alts don't have this.    There was no pre-mine of bitcoin so the founders can pump it and get rich. The software developers behind Bitcoin far more in number and have by far the most established and trusted software, whereas alts act as a testbed for new features.  
All I'm saying is that if you don't know a lot about cryptocurrency it is easy to get sucked in to something far less important 
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:54:52
Thanks my buddy made the same offer on the run up to $40 in 2013.  It didn't give great returns. I don't gamble on alts anymore.

None of this is true.  This person is either very misinformed or trying to make you that way.  Altcoins are not nearly as good an investment they are penny stocks and this guy is pumping or dumb money. Research your investments

I'm not going to talk about the particular alt coin you are shilling because this is not r/(insert your alt here).  I don't break the rules.  And yes I've known about it since 2010.
