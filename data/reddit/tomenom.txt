Only way to stop a tax cheat with some bitcoin is with an IRS agent with some bitcoin?  Nah.

Unfortunately, I think Google does release betas - they just call them releases and let their Nexus users do their beta testing.
I'm not suggesting Google is mr. nice guy - the skyhook thing being a good example.
I think that article makes no sense - those that use Android must either sign-on for the whole GApps suite etc., or they must go it their own the way that Amazon and Blackberry have.
Chrome is just another in the GApps suite, except that it is open-source, and is more easily replaceable (Amazon &amp; BB have built their own and Firefox and Opera are quite decent Android browsers).
I think the most insidious thing is still to come - the use of 'Go' in chrome and Android.  It makes no practical technological sense, but it is 'owned' by Google so it could give them greater control.

Arrr, No, that's not what he said.
He said "US", not North America.  They are not the same thing, so he left out Canada too!
Not that I care that he left it out, but if you are going to quibble then quibble correctly.

How can you peg BTC to a local currency given how unstable its value is?
@_date: 2014-08-12 20:42:07
The link is to ibitimes - one of the slimiest link bait, auto-restart video ad, sites around.  
I'm not saying the story isn't true, I'm just suggesting that you shouldn't be surprised that you don't find an external link, and commending you for wanting to see the actual thing rather then trust ibi.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:22:11
That is tragic, but I don't think we should consign people to hell until we know much much more then we do now. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 21:04:02
I think it be better to say that you should make sure to understand the security implications before you root your phone.  If done with some care you can make your phone more secure e.g. keeping it more up to date
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:16:12
Yeah, but most people aren't comfortable initiating payment until the work is complete.  I would love to avoid having the merchant loose 2+% of what I pay, but the transaction needs to complete quickly.
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:09:49
OK, I will check it out.
@_date: 2014-06-08 21:46:26
Is is possible that the "green text URL" which "clearly said  was just an image?  That's what they do for phishing e-mails.
I'm not trying to get google off the hook here, but I think this is an important reminder that we need to teach people to check to make sure the URL is what they are inspecting before they download or enter a password.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:26:37
Getting the word out, as you're doing here, is probably all you can do, unfortunately.
For what its worth, I can say that Canadian bit-coiners recommended QuickBT to me in September 2013.  I checked it out and it appeared to be fully functional at that time.
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:27:39
But the published BTC prices would have to fluctuate with the exchange - my point was that big companies prefer to publish stable prices.  As well, it is not ideal to have to do a currency conversion on all your income - conversion is not free.
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:49:28


I'm guessing they will be hesitant to take BTC for payment of their own services until BTC exchange stabilizes.  Most big businesses want to be able to publish rates, and have those stay fairly stable.
@_date: 2014-01-23 02:36:57
Actually, no I haven't, but I don't see that I need to have used it to understand that its volatility is considered a problem for certain use cases.  I think that your response acknowledges that greater price stability is needed for greater acceptance.  I think there are a lot of potential ways Google could support and use bitcoin where the instability would not be an issue, but if they accept it as payment in places where they currently accept US$, then it becomes an issue.

?? I'm sure that  AOSP browser is still there, and I'm pretty sure that Chrome (other then plug-in functionality) is all open-source, and I thought Chrome for Android was too - was I wrong?
Looking it up, it says it is open-source, but with a bit of ambiguity:
I would also point out that everyone knew this change was coming.
As for the process issues you describe, that does impact upon the degree to which it is open, but not open-source.
I also think it is pretty unrealistic to expect that Google, locked in a nasty battle with Apple and MS (see Rockstar) to actually develop Android in the open.
Most importantly, let's go back to where this started.  You stated that Android is "just slightly less closed then iOS/Windows Phone/Blackberry".
And now we are debating how core the location services are, and Google switching one open-source browser for another - pieces of a massive open-source code base.  
I can see that you were upvoted for that and I was downvoted for strongly disagreeing, but even after this discussion I still strongly disagree.  Further, now I see that know the topic in-depth, so I'm really baffled that you would have said it in the first place.
Finally, I will add that I'm not just reacting because you are attacking Android - it is way too buggy and should be attacked on that basis.

One thing that concerns me about documentaries like this.
For regular news I know how to be very careful and selective about sources and trust.
But with documentaries, they often gloss over the source of the info.  Not saying that about this one - I'm going to watch it but haven't yet - just suggesting a more general issue.
@_date: 2017-01-11 03:08:26
Imagine how much money you could make it you could get advance warning of his tweets (eg. his recent tweet about GM).
I guess that's why most presidents (and others in position to affect the markets) are very careful with what they say/publish.
@_date: 2017-01-18 02:40:48
That's interesting, I didn't see that one.  Can you give me a reference (really, I am interested).
An Economist-YouGov survey showed that about half of Donald voters still believed in pizzagate, even after the high-profile, post election debunking, so nothing about voters will shock me anymore but still interesting to read.  
@_date: 2015-07-30 12:24:37
It's good stuff, but I don't really think 'saviour' is the right word.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:16:54
You think that voluntary taxes will work?  Seriously?
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:16:53


Because citizens don't want to pay for much of anything, so the result will be almost no services.  In your model of gov't operated like any other business, this makes sense, and lots of people love this idea.
But if you go back to my post that started this, it seems to me that we have come full circle and are re-enforcing my original point.  Though lots of poor people rant against taxes and vote for politicians who promise to attack the governments ability to raise them, a working progressive tax system is very good for them.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:58:11
Yeah, that's my point.  People want something for nothing and given the chance there are lots of people who will vote for big spending and then cheat on their taxes - expecting others to pay, just like you said.
If collecting taxes was so super easy as you are suggesting, then why do so many countries have a difficult time of it.  The sting operations you are suggesting are crazy expensive for starters.
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:54:49
The actual processing of the transaction is something that has a very low barrier of entry - so new players will emerge if anyone starts charging too much.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:09:02
Writing 'cue the cries of conflict of interests' does not make the issue go away.  When you become aware that your sources are invalid you don't just put a footnote to that effect, you stop using them.
Your reference to 'specific app stores in certain market subsets' is also disingenuous.  99% of the people reading your scare-mongering happen to be in those little 'segments', and most importantly, those who aren't know it.   China can have its own discussion about security, but we don't have to run away from Android because it is insecure in China.
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:11:37
But other people have a completely different idea about what should be paid for.  Clearly tons of people support the war on drugs, and I support enforcing parking tickets - why should I be the only one who pays for parking?  And that's just one small area of the state's (potential) activities!
Sounds like you might be a Libertarian, but then why would you be arguing against my concern that bitcoin will undermine state revenue - that should be your favorite thing about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:32:24


You are decrying the spreading of misinformation about your preferred platform (iOS), while at the same spreading misinformation about the other!
I thought this had been clarified enough already but, outside of China and very advanced users who know the risks, Android users use the Google Play store (or Amazon app store), where malware is rare and getting rarer - quite the opposite of 'growing by leaps and bounds'.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:09:14
Yeah, that's the good part, but it maybe also rid the world of effective states.
There are many reasons to like bitcoin, but one of them - making tax evasion easier - only makes sense if you are super rich.  So, while I won't defend Krugman's entire article, I think he is right to remind us of that.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:04:50
So, the gov't isn't doing what you want, and that is your excuse for not paying your taxes?  Or paying taxes is inherently bad?
Either way, if you are very rich then yes, undermining the tax system is great, but for the rest of us a progressive tax system is the only hope, so trying to make gov't better makes more sense then trying to destroy it.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:38:24
Okay, so then get rid of them, and then lets see what happens to your beaches, roads, and electricity.  Actually we don't have to wait - it's obvious: those things will only be for rich people living in exclusive communities with private services.
Maybe that's how it already is in your country, but you can hardly expect me to cheer something that will cause that everywhere (you are the one who are promoting it as a means of tax evasion).

Well, Play Services is a bad development, it is true to its name: google services.  It is google ads, google maps, google auth, g+, google wallet.  Location is the most borderline one, but even it is a service of google, not a stand-alone component of  OS.
There isn't anything else is there?  The GApps and Play Services (and drivers, of course, but that has been an issue since the beginning).
For a competitor (e.g. Blackberry and Amazon) to use Android to build an alternative, they have always had to contend with replacing all Google services.  For example, BB has had to turn to openstreetmaps to mimic the maps API's.  
And I think the fact that Google's competitors can and do still build their own Android from AOSP is the best indication that enough of Android is open for it to be considered an open-source OS.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:10:53
With so much written about the potential to warp stats etc., I believe that you shouldn't quote stats from a company with a direct financial interest in them.  And I do not believe that makes me a whiner (I refer to your 'cue the cries of' comment).
Other then that I don't disagree with what you are writing now, but I do still think that your original post was inflammatory.  If you think it is hard fighting mis-info about iOS and BTC, then consider Android &amp; security, where most of the population believes that what you wrote in your first post applies to them.  I'm actually rather puzzled at the success of Android given its reputation.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:55:22
I do believe the Android flagships (most notably, the Galaxy S and Note) are as expensive as iPhone and sell as well.  And personally, I bought an Android because I didn't like Apple's philosophy - and I think that is a common reason.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:27:46
Governments already have a hard time with taxation.  Tax evasion was a big cause of the problems that caused the European crisis (e.g. Greece), and black markets are booming in many countries.
My country, Canada, commonly rates as one of the most law abiding in the world, and yet half the providers of goods &amp; services will offer me a discount if I pay cash so they can avoid paying taxes (you mentioned sales tax).
Bitcoin doesn't make taxation impossible, but it could make it much more difficult.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:59:54
It makes no sense to me - given the efficiencies of digital communication etc. - that a few percentage points of almost every transaction I make must go a 'middleman'.
The financial (esp. credit card) industry needs a serious shake up, and I believe that bitcoin is the only prospect of that happening.
@_date: 2013-12-29 18:10:21
Okay, but I will would have preferred to see respond to his points more substantively and directly.
Don't get me wrong - some people/threads have done that, but the highest rated and most frequent responses have been to attack Krugman rather then his arguments.
The fact that the entire post about his anti-bitcoin article has been eclipsed by a new one dedicated to highlighting his past failures is unfortunate.
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:45:15
I'm assuming that real competition will exist between them, driving their cut down to what it should be.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:44:02


Well, that's ridiculous.  So, if someone uses a bunch of closed source apps on Linux then that makes Linux 'just slightly less closed' then Windows?
The growing tendency of 3rd party apps to depend on closed source components is certainly a concern if you want a pure open-source system, but such details are minor compared to the ridiculously broad mischaracterization you've made.
(And you should have mentioned Ubuntu amongst the alternatives.)
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:51:39
But a lot of the proponents of bitcoin seem to like that part of it the most.  The other thread I'm engaged in below is people advocating bitcoin for that very purpose.
Based on the flat tax link you've provided, I get the impression that you are not a fan of the progressive taxation anyway, so I don't expect you to weep if your state dies for lack of tax revenue?
