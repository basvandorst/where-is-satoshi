Because it's using a currency that banks want controlled. But can't and talking about it in a good light is good news and won't be tolerated by the news stations.

I mean like I'm not giving up on bitcoin it's just I want to use it on steam but they still don't accept bitcoins so I have to resort to something like this.

Good point. But I was never an adopter I've never owned bitcoin or mined it. I have wanted to but always my circumstances have been different or just something I can't afford I've passed it up at every drop crash and increase. All for different reasons.
Just been a bystander to this while phenomenon.

@_date: 2015-08-28 14:20:14
Wait the fuck are you serious. 
Is there a source to that?

Hey whoever manages this domain. I'll redo the entire site for free if you let me. And I'll do it in WordPress and you literally can't go wrong with that.  EDIT: To clarify I'm not going to be using wordpress to do this, it was just an example of what I can do it in.
This is dumb your site looks like absolute shit and half your CSS is broken on mobile and images don't load. Did you make this site for IE7 or something?
@_date: 2015-08-27 13:14:16
Yeah but firechat uses Bluetooth. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:33:07
Yeah I know, WordPress was just an example.
@_date: 2015-08-28 04:28:23
Clearly you haven't sen the edit. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:27:28
Yeah lol

It would run it through a couple hundred different Bitcoin addresses and maybe sometimes a few thousand so it would be extremely difficult to find where it went.

Most apps just randomly pick from a range of ports. Like tor already does.

That's because of the Shitty US banking system. 
They transfer the money from I think their US Reserve's into your bank account. So its not PayPal is a limitation that the US Government is putting on them. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:03:24
That's actually pretty awesome.

Stop keeping all your Bitcoin in exchanges. only leave a small amount.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:33:44
These people are at their own fault for leaving so much in a exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:07:17
Yeah I've already looked at that and all and I'm still a bit skeptical. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:15:32
When would you think it would be a good time? 
In like a week or so?
