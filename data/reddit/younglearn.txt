If core and classic can  accepted this proposal,  each select some  full nodes to test the upper block limits, maybe the data gap is not large, this might facilitate a consensus to move forward.

if fewer miners insist on mining on their blockchain, what will happen? How can we explain this to public?
If there is no consensus，fewer miners will have good reason to split the blockchain.
If there has consensus, any one who split the blockchain is to say they are evil to public.

Central management agencies is inevitable, but selection standards, nodes of the network, hardware and software configuration is open, test data is exposed, which can accept public supervision in the community. If we can eliminate the differences of core and classic, these are worth.

Core and Classic both have  very strong supporters with great passion, if we can find a way can be implemented on the protocol level，Let both sides reach a consensus on one blockchain, that a great mechanism we all want, But we have not find such a mechanism for more than a year. So I  proposed this way outside system Protocol, hoping to find  a  acceptable upper block limit for both sides.

If I sent a tx from A address to B with no fee, and sent another tx from B to C with high fee, what will happen?
