But but in the faq the bitcoin glosses over this sort of stuff.   Therefore its ok.
@_date: 2011-05-26 01:46:10
Its seems all over the map as far as D-wave goes.   Its at the boundary at the least of QC.
Still, the faq is entirely too dismissive.   There seems to be little on potential failure modes and response.  
Like why I take off in a airplane, I roll way past minimum takeoff speed before I rotate.  I do this, and so does every other pilot, in case the engine failure mode happens.   So I have enough kinetic energy to have a few seconds to think before I loose altitude.
BTC and QC - the failure mode is just brushed off.   From your arguments however, I see that some have considered it and have remediation in mind.

It was created by a quantum computer at Dwave who is about to break all the BTC encryption.
@_date: 2011-05-25 23:25:18
Ok thats basically what I thought.   This is why I am leary of using BTC as an inflation proof investment.   For anonymous peer to peer payment, I think its highly valuable.

Never talk to cops!   Goddamn!  When are you going to figure it out?!
@_date: 2011-05-25 00:53:20
I don't think this addresses it at all.
It seems hand wavery to me and I fail to see how you can tell people who used a QC to mine all the remaining coins, to put them back.
@_date: 2011-05-25 23:26:10
I think I really need to read the source code.  :)

TL;DR; People buy bitcoins, see the dollar plummeting, and spend FRNs instead while the last.
@_date: 2011-05-25 03:40:46


Well they could do that.   I suppose one could look for a client doing this and have a shutdown protocol and investigation.   I can see ways to deal with this as it requires peer to peer validation.  Just like the banks will do.  "Shit QC have our keys.  You have to physically show up and get a one time pad on micro sd from us from now on!"


Are you so sure?   Lets imagine an extreme case.   Suppose there are a total of 1000 coins.   2 are legit and people like them.   It spreads and 10 are in use.   Then someone grabs the remaining 990 using a QC.    Do you really think the value of the original 10 would still remain?
It would be one hell of a sucker punch to the first 10 coins.   Of course, suppose further that the QC can't break the new key scheme for existing coins and the 1000 can still be used securely.
Then I would use BTC.  No problem.   Their remaining value as a secure anonymous money would still exist.  If the one dude sits on the 990, this will not be true, but if they eventually make it into circulation, then I would use BTC.   Given a better encryption method(one time pads for example)


Ok.  I wasn't sure if you could change the "problem" that mining represents fundamentally.  I know that it has parameters that scale with the number of BTC "discovered" -- but I am obviously fuzzy on those details. 
Perhaps the BTC2.0 currency would have "problems" that even QC could not break?  Or maybe I simply need to read the source code to see what is really happening...
**TL;DR;  QC may(will?) screw over current BTC owners.  Using a QC proof cryptography, the BTC will still be useful for new users of it.   IMHO. **
/Sadly I feel just like I am a statist arguing for exceptions to the "universal" non aggression principle.   I am not... reason compels me and I hope I am not being trollish and obtuse.

BTC?  Bit Coin?  
Just because the Dollar's value is not set to the BTC, does not mean that none of its exchange rates are set by law.
@_date: 2011-05-25 00:14:01
But every current BTC will be worthless.  Sure you can come up with a new way to generate one time pads other than using prime composite factorization. 
It still remains that the BTC already out there will be worthless.  Until some one can satisfactorily demonstrate that this is a non-issue, then I will stay away from holding on to BTC for longer than a few miliseconds.
Until then, I will buy BTC using fiat money and use the BTC to IMMEDIATELY purchase something.  If someone pays me in BTC, I will immediately convert them to something else.
@_date: 2011-05-25 23:22:46


This doesn't support the premise that QC is a distant threat.  
I also don't buy that BTC will not be attacked because there are other targets.   You are making a mere assertion here that "It won't happen to BTC".  I question that assertion.

What kind of currency do you mean? 
*Do you mean a fractional reserve currency?*
Sure Nixon killed that.    The regulated banks that are allowed to practice fractional reserve banking, stopped backing their FRNs with gold and silver long ago.   All they are backed with are a fraction of the "advertised" FRNs in the bank's reserves.
**Gold is dead** here.
*Do you mean a fiat currency?*
N/A.   By definition this means declaring something that has near zero intrinsic value as legal tender.  Gold, having intrinsic value, can't apply here.  Evar.  Well, barring cheap nuclear transmutation by a type K1 civilization.
*Do you mean a commodity currency?*
Well, since gold is a commodity, if fits by definition.   Gold, guns, whisky, gas, .... etc.   Commodities.
 
I can trade a gold ounce bar for something today.
*Do you mean a receipt currency?*
Well if lets say I have a "guaranteed" warehouse receipt for one ounce of gold.  I can use this receipt to barter that ounce just like above.
So in one of the of the many types of currencies, gold is dead.  You are right in that sense.

Not really.   You are rate limited on sending user names to my systems.  If you get access to my encrypted password files, then you can use a QC to get the passwords easily.  But you have to get access to the files FIRST.   Any hacker who can escalate this sort of privilege, can also try to setuid to root.   It mostly works.   Then install a key sniffer in memory and harvest passwords.    Its not that hard really.
Or your QC can sniff SSL connections and harvest passwords.
Also, Its not like a single QC hack would hack all SSL sessions at once.  It doesn't have infinite bandwidth.   Some target will be hit and the world will be saying, "Damn!  I need to call my bank."  And the bank will say, "All account access is suspend.  Please come to us in person."
But we would quickly switch to QC proof encryption.  One time pads are still beyond ken.  The world would soon switch to one time pads or whatever for the serious stuff, like SSL sockets.  Reddit, with its throwaway accounts will still probably use the old SSL as exchanging onetime pads requires users to meet reddit in person and it will not be worth the effort.
But what if someone mines all the remaining BTC using a QC?  What does this do to the value of the BTC currently held?  Saying the world will collapse first is not a decent answer IMHO.

My quantum computer says to not trust BTC.
@_date: 2011-05-20 17:53:35
I am arguing largely from ignorance here.   From what little I gleaned, the keys to mine more BTC get harder and harder as more and more BTC are found.
This seems to be for Moore's law.   
But, what if quantum computers have arbitrarily large registers?   No matter how large the keys are, these "future" machines, "might" be able to factor ANY composite in a few operations.
Again, I am making this argument from ignorance and I welcome correction.
@_date: 2011-05-20 02:28:03
I fear quantum computers.   Being able to factor large prime composites in a single operation or two, makes BTC worthless. 
Sure its scaled for Moore's famous quip, but what about qBits?
@_date: 2011-06-11 02:21:29


I support this, you provided value with your critiques, then honestly disclosed that you also wanted to plug your value to the world.

Well DWave has a unit that is for sale right now.

Those are big eyes.   Perhaps the natural fur helps protect them from random stuff.   Perhaps the fur keeps the ears from getting bugs and stuff.
Same for the hocks(?right word?).   The fur is padding that keeps them from smashing their tendons into stuff.

You could more correctly call these things fees.
A fee to drive on a private road.  A fee to own a home in a privately owned city.  A fee to purchase goods in a privately owned shop.
Taxes are geographic fees typically connected to no specific activity.
