Damn, what was number 3?

Just saw it, thanks!

I just hit 100 spins, and I think I know what I like about SatoshiCircle.
When you plan SatoshiCircle, you don't play it as a form of income, it's a game!
If you get lucky and manage to make a profit out of it, then that's fantastic for you, but don't let it get you down otherwise.
I like the way that it sympathizes with you for winning or losing, and the reward point system is a great idea.
I've managed to lose a lot of the Satoshis that were granted to me, but I'm really not phased because of how much I simply enjoy the game. It's interesting and entertaining to jump between the 2x and 3x wheel and try work out which one will give you a better chance.
Thanks again to you guys, I've been wanting to give SatoshiCircle a real try and you guys made it possible. Buying BTC in South Africa is a nightmare!
My alias is EnigmaSA, same as my reddit username.

Unless I'm somehow mistaken, he just left.
I saw a post from him in which he stated the above while tipping about 5BTC.

Thanks so much, answered all my questions.

It's June 1st, so I hope I'm not too late!
Thanks, you guys have always been great.

Are litecoins worth mining with a GPU? I thought they were resilient towards that?
@_date: 2013-06-02 20:51:34
Stumped here too.

Fantastic idea!
I'm loving all the alternative names for tipping, it makes it so much more satisfying. I'm hoping to load up some BTC into my wallet soon and get to it.

Congrats to you! Enjoy the BTC :)

Now you've piqued my interest to say the least.
I've been looking for a simple way to buy in SA for a LONG time. 
Looking forward to hearing more from you.

More of the beginning of the end for us mortal miners who can't afford an ASIC miner. Shipping is tough.
Finding it really tough to get hold of any BTC at the moment, and it's going to stay like that until South Africa has a more accessible method of buying them.

That's fantastic, Happy cake Day!
Would donate if I could!

I was on that track when it was found actually. Thanks!
