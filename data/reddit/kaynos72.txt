I have been with Quadriagcx since June and only have good things to say about them.   Btw don't worry if it takes some times for the bitcoin to hit your wallet, currently the transaction are very slow to confirmed on the blockchain unless you pay crazy high fees.

Agreed, this can't continue anymore, each time there is a movement in price the delays and fees go through the roof.  i'm gonna take my business elsewhere, like Litecoin.

Don't touch anything at the moment until the whole drama is over.  There is still over 280,000 unconfirmed transaction in the mempools, the fees are insanely high.   Moving Bitcoin at the moment is not a good idea.

Don't buy blindly, keep your money and buy the dips.

Do you have your software wallet install yet ?  Choose the bitcoin wallet, click the receive tab and copy the address there, it's your bitcoin address.  Go on Quadragcx, click the XBT tab, withdraw, enter the amount you want to withdraw and the bitcoin address of your software wallet.

Jager you should be ashamed of yourself to blatantly tell a customer that's been struggling to contact you for weeks to just fucking use your useless ticket system.

Then you come on Reddit and tell the same person to stop whining.  Shame on you sir.

You short bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:50:43
The only thing you need is your list of words (private key).  No need for backup.  Your bitcoin balance is linked with that key.  If you lose it your done.  You can lose or break your ledger no problem.
@_date: 2018-10-26 11:55:20
I had the same experience about a year ago, they held my money for 4-5 months before finally pay up.   It was not a huge amount but nonetheless it was MY money.   This kind of behavior need to stop, i think it's a major reason why crypto are still not mainstream, too much things like that still happen, it's the wild wild west.

Same for Genesis Mining but it's not surprise from them.  By the way hashflare is on 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:03:21
Then like the first poster said, anything you control your private key is safe.  If you want an easy to use one, try the Jaxx, it can be added to Chrome as an addon.  Be sure to keep the serie of words in a safe place, it's the only way to get your bitcoin back if something happen to your computer.

LOL more like capital losses in my case.  Silver and Gold prices have gone nowhere in the last 5 years.  I bought during the 2012 (i think) run to 50$ silver.  Everyone was saying silver was going to hit 100$, we know what happen.  Been waiting and waiting and waiting for it to take value and now i'm tired and want to get rid of it to get some bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-01 22:10:49
How hard could it be to sell gold and silver for bitcoin directly ?  I don't know any shop that would buy and pay in bitcoin.  And selling for cash is a bad idea when you get to deposit it, it will looks suspicious to a bank.  As for checks i'm afraid of them, anyone can write a check and just get away with my stuff.
@_date: 2019-06-10 22:25:16

Good luck doing business with CONbase.  New account restriction is beyond ridiculous.  Forget about investing 25k on coinbase.   Even if you could deposit anything, the withdraw feature is disabled, so what's the point of buying crypto if they are stuck on coinbase.  I'm not in the US but i heard Kraken is pretty good.  In canada i recommend Shakepay.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:44:52
Because it's a 2 years contract and at the current price i get my ROI in 6 months, so that 1 1/2 year of pure profit after that.  But of course if ETH drop down to 50$ i'm screwed.   But so has you if you buy some at the current price then drop to 50$.  However if it goes to 500$ by the end of the year, i get my ROI even faster and they still pay me for 1 1/2 year.  Nothing is guarantee here.  Buying and holding is the safest way but if the price crash, we are all loser.

I'm using Exodus on my desktop, Jaxx on my Iphone and soon to use Trezor for cold storage.  Coinbase i say ok to buy but don't leave your coins there.

Check the prices now, that's why you hodl.  Both ETH and BTC are back on the + side !

Let's go to 3500 so everyone sell, i want to buy but not at that price.  My prediction back to 2500 by tomorrow night

Just 2 years back, everyone would be milllionaire.

I can understand why because it's Canada.  The volume is just not high enough to compensate for Bitcoin volatility.

Store your bitcoins on a physical wallet like Trezor or Ledger, forget about it for 10 years and you'll be a millionaire.

@_date: 2017-06-06 01:06:55

@_date: 2017-06-11 21:04:22
For canadian go here 
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:54:18
Yep hodling is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:51:48
spikes like that are not healthy, we need slow and constant growth.

@_date: 2017-06-11 20:41:37
because i need it to pay for everything else ?
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:14:06
I'll bite.  Just ordered a Trezor even though i was really looking for a Ledge Nano but they are nowhere to be found. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:56:12
The prices are almost back to what they were yesterday.  BTC is now only -2% and ETH -4%
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:21:57
I'm waiting for the dips but they are not coming.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:48:07
Quelle conne.

I never said it was the only reason.  I imagine that the sale volume difference between the US and CAD must be enormous.  Add to that the tiny fraction of CAD customers paying in Bitcoin.  And like you said, if the Bitpay is being an ass, it a combination of all these factors.

The fees on ATM are ridiculously high, like 10%.   Unless you have a problem getting registered to an exchange, don't use them.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:30:21
as low as possible i want to buy
