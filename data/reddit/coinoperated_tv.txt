If a given activity X is profitable, and if it is possible for actor A to reinvest profits from doing X into more X infrastructure, how can any modification to the process of X prevent A from accumulating an ever-larger share of X-derived profits and infrastructure, i.e. prevent A from becoming a successful agent of "X centralizing pressure"?  
Also, having a limited scarcity cap on X amplifies this feedback loop.

Most of the stories on Reddit are sourced somewhere else anyway.  Coindesk, IRC logs, blog posts, and yes, Twitter.  
If you must use r/bitcoin, skim the new feed to see stories that keep popping up but never get upvote traction, then drill into them at their source until you find something interesting.   Don't neglect the other subs like r/btc, r/bitcoinxt, and even r/buttcoin, these places catch things that this sub misses (or doesn't allow, or doesn't like to talk about).  
You probably have been developing your own network all the while, so Reddit will be well behind your own curve after a few months.

There are one or two threads in buttcoin that are also closing in on similar conclusions.
Everyone's jumping the gun, though the details being unearthed in the process are admittedly quite interesting.

Bitcoin has many "foundations" trying to control its future, the "Bitcoin Foundation" is merely the one that openly declared its aims and activities, which in the context of a nominally decentralized movement is a hindrance to fulfilling them because it paints a target on one's back. This is not even addressing the competence of the group itself, which is another story.
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:37:36
Bitcoin is an attempt to carry the concept of the "rule of law" to its logical conclusion: Where "The Law" doesn't need a separate enforcement apparatus if it can prevent illegal behavior by crafting the rules of material existence such that illegal behavior is rendered fundamentally impossible, like trying to add a new color to the rainbow.
This only works if every possible action that can influence the state of the system is an emergent property of the rules that define that system.
Unfortunately Bitcoin's rules for "consensus" are rather like the mechanically defined rules for solving a Rubik's cube: they work perfectly and fairly if they are followed, but like a Rubik's cube they have no way to resist exogenous forces from the outside breaking them apart and reassembling them arbitrarily to arrive at a politically valid, yet academically "illegal" solution.
For Bitcoin to work as advertised it has to take over every single aspect of human interaction, or else it will be cheated, gamed, and short-circuited over and over by external forces using external channels with the motivation to make it bend to their will.
The political block size fork war is an example of this: Consensus is not determined inside the mining majority framework, but on the outside, through Twitter campaigns, censorship on Reddit, DDOS attacks on nodes, pecking order establishment and reestablishment, Github access privileges, IRC and mailing list flamewars, and a hundred bloggers and pundits all working in the interest of one side or the other. The miners end up following where the demagogic conversation leads, not the other way around. In fact the miners "consensus" is just an official confirmation sideshow here, like the electoral college in the USA presidential election system.
In short, old fashioned group political dynamics determine what happens to Bitcoin. The vaunted consensus mechanism in the PoW mining scheme follows, rather than leads, the REAL consensus-making process that happens in the same old messy political grandstanding and backroom tactics that every other group has ended up relying on since the dawn of human tribalism.

The first with its own semi-autonomous internal economy, yes.  But not the first that specifically tried to be decentralized as a matter of identity. The 17th century Levellers did the same, and it's fair to argue that any group whose individual members attempt to separately pursue a set of shared agendas rather than follow a set of shared leaders and figureheads is just as decentralized as Bitcoin. 
The problem then, as now, is that it never has been able to scale, without power self-organizing into clumps around favorably situated nodes, causing a snowballing effect of centralization. 
An excellent and insightful essay expressing exasperation over this observation is [The Tyranny of Structurelessness](  
The tl;dr  takeaway from that essay is that structurelessness (the term 'decentralized' wasn't yet in vogue) simply masks the real structure which develops anyway, because it has to in order to get concrete tasks done. This structure is informal communication among friends, and this inevitably leads to elitist and exclusive cliques that are in de facto control of the movement.

This was the news item (when it originally happened) that triggered the first significant wave of positive mainstream news exposure for Bitcoin in the USA (and perhaps elsewhere?).  
The November 2013 bubble got a massive boost from this story, it was everywhere for about a week just a little bit prior to the follow-up investment surge as people took time to figure out how to get money into Bitcoin (sadly, that route was mostly Mt. Gox thanks to their high visibility and slick-looking website).

A tradeoff:  Give back comment scores, but change default sort to "Controversial"
*Would ideally prefer to have a hybrid sort algo called "Best Controversial," something similar to Slashdot's "Interesting" moderation category.
Edit 2:  Looks like this thread is now set to sort by "controversial (suggested)" - neato.

This thread is not exactly bringing out the best of r/bitcoin. 
The reasons for why a given thing did or didn't happen won't be coaxed out any faster by being insulting toward people involved.  Even if you have no moral qualms with being an aggressive jerk to get answers, you seldom help your goal by playing those cards right away.  
@_date: 2015-12-08 16:52:14
Controversial is the most interesting (as in least echo chamber-ish) default sort in most subreddits IMHO.  
@_date: 2015-12-09 18:36:43
Except that the creator of Bitcoin and the largest single controlling stakeholder happen to be the same person. If I were assessing risk for a firm interested in making a significant investment in Bitcoin, I would not be that interested in who created it, but I would very much like to know something about an individual who could wreck my investment with little more than a sneeze.
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:40:19
If a comment scores "high" (so to speak) on the controversial sort, then it has been upvoted and downvoted about equally, and frequently vs other comments.  It means that the comment touches on something that is not entirely agreed upon by the majority - but still commands its interest, and this is where the most interesting discussions start.  Common trolling will get downvoted and ignored and won't show up highly ranked in the Controversial sort.

Bukowski's a great writer but he is not the originator of that quote, though maybe the first to use that exact wording.
It goes back at least as far as Yeats in 1920:
    The best lack all conviction, while the worst
    Are full of passionate intensity.
And a short time later (1935), Bertrand Russell reintroduced it in a more familiar form:
    “The fundamental cause of the trouble in the modern world today 
    is that the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.”

This is an extremely informative "how to" that you ended up (perhaps unintentionally) making here, kudos!
How much time do you think you spent on all of these steps, in total?  That is, how much of your own time, not including waiting for confirmation and such from the other parts of the process.

Not that I entirely disagree with the overall slant of what you are saying, but your specific example really doesn't hold true.  


You've quite nearly described places like Sushi Saito and Mizutani in Tokyo, which have reservations booked out for *months*, and never have trouble getting business.  They don't charge $8000 a plate (unless you get drinks...), but it's still way out of the ballpark of what most solidly middle class diners would consider reasonable just for putting bits of flavorful meat in their mouths. And yet, they don't go out of business despite refusing to expand.  They have a niche and they serve it well, and everyone involved is happy. 
On a more general note, Bitcoin can only serve a rather small slice of the total economic pie so it has to be tailored to whichever slice is most likely to be able to sustain it with the most stability.  This fact, based on as yet not fully explored dynamic limits of the system, will not change much even if you have 2MB blocks - it just changes the mixture of people who can participate as peers by excluding others.   It may well be that the most stable customer base are those who are willing to pay the proverbial $8,000/plate.  It may be a wider group, but it's a very limited one regardless.

This has the effect of stinking up the room with ego tripping flatulence and driving out the competent and unassuming thinkers uninterested in having to first play janitor, then contributor.

It's a bit of obscure video gear history, but for those who are familiar with the [Trinity Broadcaster]( (the spiritual successor to the Video Toaster, developed by many of the same people), it was also preceded by a "MVP" of sorts called the Snappy. 
Whereas the Trinity was an over the top large-scale video studio in a box costing $6,000-$20,000, the Snappy was essentially a retail product built around a single ASIC developed as part of a much more complex set of silicon which would later go into the Trinity. 
Snappy was an easy to use, slickly marketed video digitizer with a very advanced GUI for its time. Priced at $199 it had a lot of retail appeal and was essentially a "startup funding" project used to generate cash as well as brand awareness that would be used to develop the vastly more powerful Trinity - the product that Play, Inc.  really wanted to create.

With respect to individual academics, you are right.  But academia as a whole, especially in the hard sciences, is generally quite good at internal self-correction - though the process is often slower than it should be.

This will be a fantastic tool for scholarship in this area.
I found small typo on the focus and scope page, under Other Policies / Digital signatures... there's a "Correspinding" in the para below.
On a more general note - the editorial policy refers to materials which describe "original research in all areas related to cryptocurrency and its intersection with mathematics, computer science, engineering, law and economics." What is your position on works that address uses for blockchain-based time-stamped consensus systems which have non-currency use cases? I.e. voting, issuing tickets, score-keeping, etc. Situations where security of the ledger is not entirely dependent on internal incentive balances so the blockchain need not be secured wholly by proof of (something extrinsically valuable irreversibly swapped for something intrinsically valuable)?

Bear in mind this limits participation to the size of a crowd than can communicate productively in a single room, assuming they can all make it there.  "Getting people together in rooms to talk" has an excellent track record for success, but it's also an explicitly centralized approach to consensus. There is some ideological give and take involved in pragmatic solutions.

The last comment is somewhat relevant, interested in knowing the context of why he thought so, or if there was an "unless" after the last word, preceding additional commentary which is omitted in the quote.  It's hard to believe the guy responsible for Metcalfe's Law would claim that the Internet would collapse and just leave it at that, without further qualification.  
As for the other two, it's important to keep in mind that the definition of "computer" (as well as what it would be used for) they were using when they made those predictions is quite different from what it has become.  Perhaps Bitcoin will find a much wider market in 20 years, but would it still fit the definition of Bitcoin as it is understood today?

He seems to have the unusual combination of a lot of money to burn (lots of oddball startup companies, somewhat high though negative profile in Sydney among technology people as a bizarre person to work for, but someone who nonetheless had a good number of employees), a lot of free time (multiple and redundant certifications, degrees - not counting the fake PhD and the dubious ThD) , and a peculiar disconnected-but-kinda-informed Bitcoin PoV.  Where does his money to play these games, and his free time to (and money) pay for these degrees and certifications come from? I don't think its his companies, unless he's Elon Musk on steroids it sounds like they are all the usual serial entrepreneur parade of fizzles, flops and the rare semi-sustainable success.

All this time I thought he just flubbed his line and mixed up two similar phrases, the first half from an old saying and the second half from the name of a song by The Who.  But in rereading it now after a few years... It occurs to me that he may have done this on purpose as realized mid-sentence that a clip of him saying "shame on me"  would be 100% pure soundbite gold, so he changed it at the last second to something a tad less exploitable.

This was the case with their meetup in Washington DC also.  The claim is that it was for "security reasons."  Been to a hundred different meetups by a dozen different groups in this space, but this was the only one with this bizarre condition for attendance.
