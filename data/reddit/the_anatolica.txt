Sorry if it sounds dumb. Is it still considered as capital gain if you buy (&amp; keep) gold/silver/bitcoin again after selling with profit? 
Let's say, I buy ₿1 at $10000 and sell at $11000 (after fees).  Supposedly I just make $1000. However, the very same day I buy $11000 worth of BTC again at $9000 = ₿1. Am I still supposed to pay tax for $1000 despite the fact that there is no net cash USD gain?

True because Satoshi will do that.
1 Satoshi = $1

I think it'll even be the norm in finance.

I would like to hear more on this if you don't mind.

It doesn't matter if it goes up or down. What matters is how fast you position yourself towards the price. Buy via debit/credit card next time and there will be a next time!

It's never late. The price is not high either. With new developments, 2018 will come with epic ups and downs.

Idk where you get the idea of banks making their clients favor. A business never makes a favor. If it does, that's how it ends up bankrupt. Businesses like publicly traded financial institutions are formed and programmed to make constant, predictable, growing profit.
A credit card customer who pays on time actually costs banks money, because banks cannot charge the customer in this scenario. The opportunity to make great profit margins (via interest, extra fee, etc) to cover regular service expenses is lost if the customer is able to pay. 
Banks are not better than sleazy payday loan businesses. They just have better offices and reputation.

because it's not about Bitcoin. It's about TD Ameritrade that gives zero fuck about Bitcoin and its technology.
