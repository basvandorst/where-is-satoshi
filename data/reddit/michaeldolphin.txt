Thought that might be the case, oh well thanks :)

Dont actually really know anyone else in my area that trades crypto, unfortunately 
It's only a small amount so I'm happy to wait and hope Coinbase adds segwit support

Just be sure to do your research, and also once you've purchased try not to store your coins in an exchange. Transfer them to a wallet that you have the private keys for

I buy with Coinbase, only need 1 form of ID and a mobile number. I think they charge 4% with credit card to purchase. 
But their fees for transferring btc are very high too 
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:32:00
Awesome, thanks so much

I can't confirm my identity in GDAX, ive done driver's license in Coinbase, we don't have "ID Cards" in Australia, I haven't been overseas so I don't have a passport and Im not trading as a business 
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:31:05
I should have mentioned I'm in Australia so I can't use GDAX unfortunately

Someone should make a short film out of this! Perfect horror/thriller material

I wouldn't necessarily say it will definitely crash, but there is a high possibility of it. At the end of the day if the majority of the population is too scared to start using it, it can never become what people seem to think it will become. But all it takes is for a few key players in the game to treat it as a genuine currency (PayPal, eBay, Amazon, apple to name a few) then maybe it will become more mainstream 
I have money in Bitcoin and other alt coins, but I'm not putting my life savings into it. If Bitcoin went bust tomorrow, I wouldn't be happy, but id get over it in a week. 
I love the potential of crypto currency but there's still massive hurdles to overcome

Do you plan on cashing out the profits until you've repaid the 100k then leave the rest? Or are you paying off the 100k with your income?
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:07:55
I would understand that there would be extra fees when purchasing, but for an exchange to show the value at $1,000 more? I'm sure in the past coinbase and btcmarkets are usually close to eachother 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:55:04
I should have been a bit more clear with what I meant sorry. I was referring to corrections after significant growth and patterns related to buying and selling

There is also a lot of trust in crypto as well. We have to assume that the exchanges we are buying from are genuine, and that they have infrastructure in place in case of a security breach or technical failures. I'm surprised that Coinbases crash the other day didn't have a larger impact on the overall value of BTC

Mind me asking what country you're in? I imagine a loan like that in Australia would be a killer haha. Although maybe not on 80k/year

Has anyone successfully signed up to gdax in Australia? My photo ID is my driver's license and they won't accept it twice... i sent a contact request last week with no response 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:13:27
That's so weird! I'll stick to Coinbase haha

Okay, that's a scary thought

Come to Australia, it's already 15k ;) but seriously, that would be awesome. Thinking of giving satoshis as Xmas gifts this year

In case you hadn't noticed, bitcoin (and other alt coins) all follow a similiar pattern to other stock markets, the major difference is the volatility and the rate of growth. Where a share in a bank may go up 0.1%, bitcoin can go up 10%. And vice versa.
Suggesting that these "old crusty grey haired" experts don't know what they're talking about is just plain ignorant. Yes, they may not understand the underlying technology and yes they may not be able to see the potential for growth in the future, but they aren't wrong in telling people to be wary when investing in such a relatively unknown and vastly changing market. If bitcoin ever goes bust (god forbid) they'll be the ones laughing

Just hodl it!

Can't wait until we can actually use GDAX in Australia!

Hodl! But yes, in a nutshell

I clicked buy 3 times thinking it wasn't working, then gave up. 2 hours later got 3 notifications from my banking app saying I had made 3 transactions. Seems like they honoured the value at the purchase time though so it's okay...

I like to live life on the edge ;)
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:19:23
Good news! Did a test with $10 (AUD) and it worked. Took about 2 minutes to confirm. Fees were $0.52. Way better than the $6 it would have cost 2 months ago!
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:30:47
i think people may be manipulating it, but i have no idea who would do that!

Do you think the transaction will actually succeed if I sent it from Coinbase?
