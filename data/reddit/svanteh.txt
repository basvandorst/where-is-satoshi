You're basically using to cry out about something. Is it that surprising that people are getting tired of seeing posts like this every single day? 
"The other night" pretty much means you haven't tried every possible way of contacting and explaing it to them but just hope will magically solve it.
Writing things like you just did is just dumb. Why would you start by insulting the very people you're asking for help?

SMS Gateways seems sadly a tad unreliable but I will look into TechCrunch's list :)

Saw that as well but 100$ limit on sales using bitcoins

I remember some discussion about letting researchers "borrowing" computional power handing out BTC rewards compared to the work done. This solves the problem with having to rework how hashes are generated and could allow older gpu farms to be useful.

Sadly still doesn't work.
Trying with this:

Late as always!
I've used the manual ordering since the Amazon one was having some troubles when I wanted to order something. I got a quick response from one of the people handling the manual orders with a message detailing that I had missed including a shipping fee, together with an attached bitpay bill. A nice touch was the screenshot showing the exact cost which was while not necessary a good way to show the customer what the extra fee was for. After paying the extra I got another quick response with order details from Amazon stating I had purchased it.
5/5 bagels.

I get a "Internal server error :/" when trying to fill out your form, any clue why this is happening?
Using Chrome version 28.0.1500.72 m
Tried latest Internet Explorer as well (woo) and getting "Access denied" message before the "Internal server error :/" pops up

I have to agree on that, if the "black market" can move the price this much, geez.

I have some suggestions:
* The design that you are using is quite pretty much it is also from  I can't find anything about which license the owner has but I would check it out and be ready to at least give him (if that's the real creator) some credit.
* As much as I would love to believe you are using multiple servers to check the uptime of each of these sites I am enclined to believe you are using a simple CURL request to the roots of every website. While this isn't bad, I would love to see you say that instead of "checking it from several locations". Reason why I believe this is that you are hosted on a One.com hosting account (as far as I can see) and they're pretty basic about this so unless you have another service that actually does the uptime checking.. **Sorry if you are in fact checking with several servers.**
* You should check out jQuery and more importantly [jQuery.ajax]( to update your online status every 60 seconds. You could even put it on a 5 minute refresh but so you don't manually have to press refresh yourself. 
* Might just be me but the text "Status checked every 60 seconds, click here to refresh" for me gives the idea that I can refresh the online status whenever I want (compared to "refresh this page")
Other than that, good job, I'm surprised noone thought of this earlier!

PHP example of Mtgox API.
You won't be able to get a live price feed without using 3rd party.

I will allow users to decide how often they can get e-mails (so it doesn't end up with someone getting a new e-mail every 5 minutes).
Smart defaults for new users is something I'm looking into as well, the exact limits etc is something I haven't decided on. The ones I wrote in the first post was just an example where you will be able to change both the percentage and over what time (e.g 5% fluctuation in the last 24h).
Sleep period sounds like a good idea.

Interesting, is there any ideas to add the ability to encrypt the wallet as well so noone can just scan it right off?

I wonder what's causing the sudden rise of ASCIMINER. It's true that they sold off a lot of Eruptor Blades but the price is just skyrocketing the last 12h or so. (yay for me!)

Bought in for 1.25BTC and in about two weeks time it has skyrocketed. Soon closing in to 1BTC profit per share by just holding them.
