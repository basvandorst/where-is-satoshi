Yeah I started out on face to face transaction and I sent him a trade request. He then tells me that he's in Vegas doing some deals there since he's a part of a bitcoin mining group. Me, being oblivious just asked if I can do the deal somehow online and we decided upon a direct wallet to wallet transfer. I sent him the moneypak codes and he told me it was received and from then on, he hasn't responded and I haven't received anything. I'm a newbie to bitcoin though, is there a possible way that it's still processing and I may have missed it?

I was planning on it but since I was excited about the price, he told me escrow would've taken 2 hours and we could just do a wallet to wallet transaction.

Yeah, I'm definitely going to. It's just a lesson learned, thanks for the tips

Yeah I did. I reported a fraud report and I'm just now waiting to file a complaint. I should've definitely read more about bitcoins since I lost a good amount of money in an instant.

He was the first seller I approached and it was very straight forward. I thought it was professional at the time but I'm just a newbie to bitcoins so I fell for his tricks
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:54:56
Yeah I think it was a social engineering scam. I fell for it, hopefully no one else does
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:55:54
That's what my plan is for the future. I'm going to be super cautious on buying bitcoins now
@_date: 2014-09-24 02:06:51
Yeah I was just stupid and didn't really look around for different websites since I thought localbitcoins would surely get me what I paid for. Thank you

Yeah, I started out as in person but the seller told me he wasn't in town and we could do an online trade. It just went downhill from that
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:25:16
He sent me a chainblock starting with a 1 and that the transactions should come from that account to mine
@_date: 2014-09-24 02:18:40
Agreed, I was just eager and stupid enough to commit a large amount for my first time. Definitely learning from this, thank you
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:40:52
Yeah it wasn't escrowed sadly...
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:41:53
Yeah I think that's what happened. I have no doubt in my mind that I'm just a newbie and I got scammed on my first deal
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:36:07
I sent him my LBC address and he told me that the transaction should be coming in from an address that he sent me. Everything looked good since he even gave me a confirmation code but I have yet to receive anything and he hasn't been responding. I checked his bitcoin address that he sent to me and chainblock couldn't find it
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:04:08
Okay sweet, this gives me a little bit of hope. I'm trying to find out about it now!
@_date: 2014-09-24 02:14:40
Yeah they do have an escrow service but I was trying to set up a face to face transaction with him. He told me that he's in my area but was currently somewhere else and we could just do it another day. I was just really anxious on getting a hold of bitcoins today that the idea of just getting bitcoins itself was already a big deal to me. So I asked if I can do a deal with him today and he exclaims that MoneyPaks is the only way he likes to do transactions. I don't even want to share this guys information just because this was my fault and I'd like to just think about it as a lesson and move on. I'll upload some edited screenshots of the convo so other people won't fall for this type of trick
@_date: 2014-09-24 02:09:30
I agree, I bought the bitcoins due to the urgency of thinking it was a good price. I'll definitely take it into account. Thank you so much
