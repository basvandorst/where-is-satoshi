This is something non-tech people will struggle with. Options.

Again, worthless

I mean intrinsic value doesn't really exist.

They're welcome to live in their delusion.

But if not my vote goes towards Wikipedia.

Eyes of and opinions of are subjective notions. We should really be focusing on what we CAN do not what others might not understand.

I wish my government would go ahead and kill me and stop teasing me about it.

I want to take time off work to write a book. Just a story that I want to write nothing technical. I'd love to put "powered by Bitcoin" on the cover though.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:54:26
I'll check out IOTA.
That's not a very good rule. It's just going to discourage people from wanting to participate more in crypto. Bitcoin is the leading brand and to most people crypto/bitcoin is synonymous.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:35:52
To my understanding, since Bitcoin has a limited supply simply looking at a supply/demand graph would show an exponential curve in the usd/btc ratio.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:58:34
I don't know what you're saying.

If you're drowning in debt then there is not much incentive not to take big risks. Nothing to lose already.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:21:44
Then how would we perceive it compared to how we perceive money today?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:05:17
it is so

The idea I had was that if you could make a crypto coin all in one and make the use to payout balanced it could be decentralized and completely self-sustaining.

my dad said it was a drugs thing and he didn't want involved

I hate being right all the time

Make the address public and make it a crowd-funded thing. Let people send BTC to the address after it's sent.
Get NASA/ELON involved to help get it there.

Fucking lol'd at gremlin's ear.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:19:51
I should specify. It's already possible to play it. I don't have the means to obtain the notes needed to play.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:55
This is the market correction, we're falling up.

No what I mean is, I want the action of transferring coins to power transferring coins.

I told him that the USD is used for far more corrupt and awful things and has been for a long time.

Well coinbase/gdax has been going down frequently today. I imagine other exchanges are also at peak capacity. So, what you're seeing on the graph is probably just the technical lull where people physically either had no more money to spend or the website wouldn't let them due to capacity issues.

Did he post any advice on how to live forever? Because, this mortality thing really puts a damper in my ambition.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:53:00
Okay but it doesn't necessarily have to be BTC

I mean I want to believe you, but I'm going to need a more convincing argument.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:08:54
So you're wanting bigger blocks? Why not just lots of little blocks? Isn't a big block essentially the same as just a bunch of little blocks? Doesn't  a smaller blocksize help weaker networks in participating?

*sigh* upvote

The government won't even realize they're playing by the rules
