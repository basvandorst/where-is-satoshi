I left mtgox immediately after seeing how they handled their crash at the time of the first $1000 market price.
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:31:53
MtGox was responsible for the first $1000 crash as well, and they lied about the facts of the matter back then too.

Lol @ 50k for 5% of the company.

It has more of a chance to double compared to something like apple stock, but it also has more of a chance to plummet.

I could be wrong but, I don't think anyone using a proper password and 2 factor auth has had their coins stolen, unless of course it was on the server side, in which case the delay would be negated anyway.
Your delay protocol would still only be as secure as the users themselves make it.  Unless of course you wanted to hardcode the delay making it mandatory for everyone, which I think is a terrible idea;  If i want my money out, I want it out right now.

No, we just have not developed the proper protocols yet.  MtGox trading could be run p2p.  Currently we have to trust MtGox, we do not have to trust the people we are actually trading with; the same could be done p2p.  The initial funding of accounts is the largest obstacle, but is by no means insurmountable.

One could say the same thing about many things.  The USD isn't worth it's current value; we've "printed"(most of it is digital) so many dollars.




This is improving daily, as more people begin to use it.


Some entrepreneurs are getting paid in bitcoins, and  now that more stores are accepting BTC, they can spend bitcoins instead of converting to fiat.


Sorry, there's just no evidence to support this.  It's all speculation either way.


Bitcoin has never claimed to be anonymous.  It is compatible being anonymous if you follow proper protocol, but that's on you, not bitcoin.




Same thing when ecommerce started.


Number of transaction is irrelevant; we need number of BTC transferred, most dice bets are minimal amounts.  There's no way of telling if a wallet transfer was one person, or some sort of commerce/service.


Gonna happen with or without bitcoin.

You can't place orders and have them filled on automatically OTC or localbitcoins.  You have to make individual exchanges; that's obviously not a gox competitor and fills a different need in the market.  
If OTC orders were automatically traded like MtGox that'd be another story, but we shouldn't need to rely on one-to-one deals over irc, or meeting people physically.

I believe that MtGox removed the fees to allow bots to control the market on purpose.  Micro transactions have been controlling the price since gox came back online.
MtGox may be doing this themselves to stabilize the price and protect their own interest in the BTC market.  
No Tx fees is either a move of stupidity or conspiracy, either way MtGox cannot be trusted.
We need p2p exchange protocols.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:15:15
That's what happens you you remove Tx fees.
Remember the last crash?  When they removed Tx fees the bot manipulation of the price was painfully obvious.

The people behind the media are not average joe.  The people behind the media do have an agenda, and they further their agenda by hiring average joes to be their news reporters.  They hire experts that don't know shit, etc.  
There isn't some guy spoon-feeding every line of drivel, because that isn't necessary or efficient.  If they want dumbed down news, they hire dumbed down reporters.

I'm not going to lie, I know I'd look at it for a good minute trying to talk myself into just taking the money before deciding that I just couldn't deal with that on my conscience. 
I once came across a whole production company's worth of A/V equipment, cameras, lenses, everything, just sitting in the driveway of a vacant house.   I sat down and stared at it for a good 15 minutes. 'Man someone's going to take it, might as well be me; this could set me up for life if I put it to good use, or I could just sell it all for a quick 200k, easy; they got to have production insurance on all this...'
Ended up calling every contact I had, and found the dumbass production that left their whole kit behind. 
I'm happy I made the right choice, but sometimes, when times are tough, I do wish that the little devil on my shoulder was a little more convincing.

We didn't pay income tax until 1913. Before then income tax was found to be unconstitutional.  
Even now our taxes do not fund the government. The majority of our taxes get funneled to the Vatican bank, to Israel and to the pockets of the owners of the federal reserve. 
The current tax system is illegal and we the people are not represented by our government.  Our tax dollars do not go towards public services the way they should. 
Our tax dollars are utilized to serve the interest of the wealthiest individuals and corporations.

If you wrote coherent and well cited articles on the short-comings of the current banking system and how bitcoin does and does not address these issues, I think you would do well.

Why would a huge exchange have an infrastructure which doesn't scale?  
Why would they run a service so poorly that they have to cease trading for 12hrs for the market to cool off?
Doesn't sound like they use common sense themselves, why should anyone assume they aren't running the site from a single box in a mother's basement somewhere?  That's the level of service they offer.

First of all, that's quite an assumption.  
Second, if you narrowed your grid to try to counteract bot manipulation, you're confirming that bot manipulation of the price is real as you are trying to account for it.

Would you say, "101111 has done a 180", or "101111 have done a 180"?
Collective nouns are usually treated as a singular entity, much like yourself.

If I had a bankroll like I know some people do, I'd be buying btc up supporting a floor at about 29; prove stability and slowly start selling them off as the market accepts the new value and starts to rise again.  Just dreamin...

I'm not a financial expert so take this with a grain of salt, but this is my take on bitcoin.
The price of bitcoin is tied to the price that it trades for on the markets. Since there are so many different exchanges, the pool of available bitcoins in any particular exchange is relatively small.    If someone goes on an exchange and sells out, the price drops more than it would if all the coins for sale at one exchange.
The sudden dip in price in one exchange causes people to panic in other exchanges. 
This is why I think we need a decentralized exchange protocol.  Current exchanges could still operate using the protocols, and offer services like bankwires, etc.
Edit:  I don't know why I responded to your question with this, sorry i guess.  I must need to sleep.

Ha, what had happened was the director of photography was supposed to be staying in that house, but ended up going to some lady's house.   
 The truck driver went to drop of the gear but no one was there; He waited a while, but received a booty call of his own and unloaded the gear into the driveway thinking someone would be there shortly. 
One of my friends was working as their gaffer and managed to contact the camera crew; they were able to handle it internally with no one getting in trouble.

Yep. I'll calling a high of 321 before the crash.
