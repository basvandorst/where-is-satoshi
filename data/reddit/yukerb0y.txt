A Trump presidency will raise bitcoin's value in the short term as people flock to stores of wealth 
Trump coming out against Bitcoin would also increase its value as people will then see what Bitcoin truly is.  It will demystify Bitcoin for the average Joe.
Trump attempting to ban Bitcoin will skyrocket the value.  As FDR did with the gold ban

If you put all the wealth of the world into Bitcoin, a Bitcoin is worth $400,000,000.

I agree completely.  I was going to tell my friends to hold off until it drops to $860.
Then, I realized we're talking $30 on a commodity that may very well be $10,000 in 2020.
So, my answer to when is a good time to get Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:11:09
These are all good points and show most of the reasons Bitcoin will be nothing more than a store of wealth.
The failure of Bitcoin as a currency is the property that makes it so valuable.  Deflation.
Bread which would go for 0.0025 today will go for 0.00125 next year.  Forward thinking businesses will realize that and cut prices based on their need for cash flow.  The more need for liquidity, the higher their price will be.  The more they can wait for Bitcoin value to mature, the lower the price will be.  
Now, math tells you my example has Bitcoin doubling in value each year.  The risk of Bitcoin value dropping is priced in due to past experience.  We have seen the value climb 6% a month knowing any month can result in a 50% value drop.  If experience hadn't taught that lesson yet, we would be seeing 20% per month growth.
Yet, it is this variation in value that will force Bitcoin to stay a store of wealth rather than a currency adopted by the general populace.  People with Bitcoin will be less willing to exchange it for goods or services knowing they could get double the goods and services next year.  Fiat will continue to be the currency used and converted to bitcoin whenever cash flow is not necessary.
@_date: 2016-11-06 00:59:56

The strength of any currency is only based upon the faith of the people that use it.  Bitcoin is the most accepted crypto and that is why it won't go the way of Atari even when a better crypto (Nintendo) comes along.
This will drive all you techno geeks nuts, but just be happy with the doubling of value each year over the next ten years.
@_date: 2016-12-05 19:00:39

@_date: 2016-09-17 12:06:42
Right now, I buy and hold assuming long term increase in value.  To increase that value, I then try to limit all transactions to just bitcoin.  Completely changed how I use currency.
The swings in value are a huge factor in discouraging the mainstream from accepting bitcoin.  Long term investors and those who want to see the evolution of fiat to cryptocurrency should be kicking day traders in the face.
@_date: 2016-09-19 00:18:10
I think everyone who actually understand Bitcoin thinks it is a revolution in currency, but I don't think everyone understands the consequences.
Interest rates will go up over the value growth rate of Bitcoin.
Long term lending will be no more.  Mortgages, car payments, even leases will be things of the past.
Frivolous spending will not occur.  Transactions will be based on necessity.  Even parting with a satoshi will be painful.  Innovation and marketing will be the only two skills that matter to gain Bitcoin.  As people see what Bitcoin does to value, they will push not only to ban it, but destroy it 
A widely adopted deflationary currency will be infinitely valuable.  If you hold a dollar today that will be worth two next year, how quickly will you spend that dollar?
I am the most bullish on Bitcoin of anyone here.  I believe we'll see 6 figures by 2024 and 7 figures by 2028.  I also know if it becomes more widely adopted, these unintended consequences will be unavoidable.
Tl;dr Bitcoin causes nuclear war.

This Ted Talk will enlighten the masses that I am one of.
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:41:06
Challenge accepted.
As Bitcoin becomes the evolution of global currency, and its fundamental deflationary value due to finite supply and increased demand undermines the current inflation standards of fiat, then one not nearly talked about side effect will be the elimination of long term credit.  Interest rates on revolving credit will have no choice but to climb to over 100% APR.  I believe that when Bitcoin hits the 100,000 USD mark in giving it the value of 1% of the world's wealth is the tipping point for long term loans.  This should be around 2023.
Now, some will think this is disastrous.  I believe this is a great thing.  The US govt will pay debt pennies on the dollar.  People will be forced to pay as they go, being debt free with reduced prices on goods, and yes, no banks.
Tl;dr Borrow now, get Bitcoin, hoard.
@_date: 2016-10-16 01:15:31
A better example.  I lend you $650 or 1 bitcoin.  Give me 1.05 Bitcoin back in 5 years, less than 1% APR.  You cannot pay me back early.
You will give me about $22,000.  You cannot afford it for $650 today.  You will default, so I will not lend.

The biggest issue I can see is the credit lockdown.  If a currency gains value, the interest rates also rise.  If I lend you a Bitcoin that will rise 40% in value each year, the interest you pay must be over 40%.  Mortgages and school loans, even car payments will no longer be an option.
A deflationary currency is viable, but will require a complete paradigm shift few will make willingly.  I invest in Bitcoin only because I feel the shift will be forced upon them.
@_date: 2016-10-15 01:06:25
Because credit.  If Bitcoin continues to double every year, what happens to interest rates?
If Bitcoin succeeds and gains tremendous value, then credit becomes a thing of the past.  No more mortgages, no more car payments.  Heck, no more credit cards.  We have forced debtlessness.  I'll enjoy it, but the people will revolt.
@_date: 2016-10-16 00:53:46
A car costs 20 Bitcoin.  I have 10.  A Bitcoin doubles in value every year.  I give you the ten for the car and agree to pay 2 Bitcoin a year for the next five years.  The interest rate was enormous as I paid 124 Bitcoin value for 10 Bitcoin borrowed at the time of purchase.
As the value of Bitcoin increases, so must interest rates.  In today's dollars, this means I gave you $6000 in Bitcoin, you leant me $6000 in Bitcoin at 0% interest (I only needed to pay the 10 Bitcoin I borrowed back) and doing so cost me $74,400.
Now, I probably default on that, which increases interest rates even more, or you refuse to lend, which end credit as we know it.
That car will only be 10 Bitcoin a year from now.  5 Bitcoin two years from now.  Spending Bitcoin will become painful as today will always be priced higher than tomorrow with Bitcoin always increasing in value.  Bitcoin will change all of us from consumers to savers and thus end credit as we know it.
@_date: 2016-10-09 13:27:43
Adoption needs to more than double every year as inflation is still 4% a year right now.  Saying we have 1% adoption currently, that puts us at 100% in 8 years.  That puts the value of Bitcoin just under 6 figures.

Guy said in a few years we will be talking about passing up on the good old days when bitcoins were $50,000.
@_date: 2016-10-05 11:50:54
If we are still talking about Bitcoin in five years, then interest rates will be over 50%.
Bitcoin as a deflating currency (supply fixed, demand rising) gains value over time.  If Bitcoin acceptance continues to grow, it eventually becomes the world standard.  With that, the rise in value will need to be reflected in interest rates.  If interest rates remain low, money will continue to flock to bitcoin, putting even more pressure on interest rates to rise.
Get mortgages and car loans locked in now.  Credit as we know it is going to lock up due to bitcoin.

If Satoshi decided to dump all his Bitcoin, the market takes a 7% hit, then possibly another 7% in panic sell offs.
The supply is inflating by 4% a year right now and the value stands at $600 for almost all of September.  The demand is matching the inflation rate at the very least and that demand continues to grow.  I see little threat from a Satoshi dump.  He's hodling.
