Someone tried to access my wallet.dat file (that holds all private keys) through my webserver running under the same ip (but on a different host through natting). This attack only would be successful if you run a very misconfigured webserver but it proves that attacks are running against bitcoin nodes.

For everybody with the same problem, it's a known problem of bitcoind, see:

Depends on the Pool. Here is a comparison:

Is there a way to change the receiving address for the local trader? I created a new HD account linked it with the local trader and bought some coins from the virtual trader but i reveived the coins with my old single address

I think a pool will only payout fees from past found blocks, not future ones youre not involved into.
Yes, a solo miner can keep the fees (only if a block is found)
Assuming that you will never find a block with solo mining you wont help the network. You should join p2pool if you want to help.

I am hosting my raspberry for free at the edis datacenter in austria:
 
Tried to run bitcoind but it crashed and caused sd card corruption. Instead of bitcoind i now run rtorrent and seed the blockchain and rise and rise of bitcoin. If youre able to get a hosting slot there, consider to host your pi there. Sadly edis doesn't accept bitcoin yet so i had to donate via paypal :(

This is true. You shold not store bitcoins on a full node. I found this in my apache logs:
[30/Jun/2014:08:16:36 +0200] "HEAD /.bitcoin/wallet.dat HTTP/1.1" 404 154 "-" "-"

Does a bitcoin node that stores only utxo help the network the same way as a normal full node does? If yes, is there a version that can be installed today or is it to unstable?

Same problem here even with firefox. But with firefox there a different message: Forbidden (403) CSRF verification failed. Request aborted. Really strange

Makes sense, thanks

How cool is that, just installed the update. Changelog said there is now trezor support
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:20:27
Thanks. After forgetting and reconnecting, it is now on 1.3.1

Same here
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:28:31
There is no address with more than ~124178 btc

Nice, did you try it? Do you really need to connect the trezor usb cable with another usb otg cable?
