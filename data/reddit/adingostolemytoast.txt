My 77 year old mum who watches the ABC news (that's the Australian public broadcaster,  very different from the American ABC) told me that their finance guy mentioned bitcoin for the first time last Monday and was very confused,  admitting he didn't have a clue what it was.  
As the week progressed he included it in his nightly market report and each day he got more and more into it - she said it was interesting watching his  learning curve.

 Oh we still have plurality. 
But our Senate voting system gives substantial minority parties a seat at the table. 
Each state has the same number of senators.  For simplicity let's call it 10.
Voting is by preference - we vote below the line,  were you have to number individual candidates in order of preference,  or "above the line" for a party,  in which case your party has set a preference order.
All the preference 1 votes are counted.  If there aren't 10 clear winners, the candidates with the lowest number of votes are eliminated and those ballots are recounted based on their second preference.  This is repeated until there are 10 clear winners. 
The result is that a minor party that nonetheless has around 10% support should get a seat. 
Preference deals between the parties are a huge thing and at the last election there were a bunch of essentially fake special interest parties that were only created to funnel votes into one major party or another.  Voter dissatisfaction, however,  meant that a couple of those fake minors managed to collect enough votes to get a seat.  It was pretty clear that the candidates in question had not considered actually becoming senators and were not happy with their success.

 Didn't the sex party change its name recently?
