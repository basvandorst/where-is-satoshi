Why is this guy getting handed bitcoin? What's so special about him? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:49:12
I have 70k satoshi :(

Can't withdraw it to my bitcoin wallet until 500k. That's ages away.

Rich man. You'll all never work again soon.

How do you buy stuff with bitcoin? You can't just go to a shop and buy groceries with it can you?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:30:56
Seeing people who can afford to just spend 10k is making me want to die. Having enough money to never habe to work is all I want and everyone here will achieve that in a few years.

I hate myself. I can bever do anything. I saw bitcoin for 100 once and thought it was too much to spend on some digital coin. Fuck sake.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:08:46
At least you're being friendly about it. Thanks.

Kill me

Will governments ever just fuck off and leave good things alone? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:05:59
Not content with that though I wish I was. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:02:22
Because they didn't work for it they just got lucky.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:28:22
Is that possible? I have 1300 satoshis.

How do ypu buy bitcoin when it costs that much?
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:16:05
How rich are you that you can spend 6000 on crypto?
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:13:09
Anyone who doesn't use it to buy drugs isn't using it properly. The only advantage it has from real money is the sweet illegal stuff you can get online. That's it.
