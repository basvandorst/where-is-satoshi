Yeah, I hooked up my bank card and buy bitcoin immediately! 
Can do the same with bank transfers too (I believe) 
Circle is great for people in the UK who dont want a lengthy process or localBTC!

It does! The money into your bank account takes a few working days.
I strongly advise you to check it out!,

Replying to the important questions here, Zane. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:51:48
Iove Circle for this. Straight into my paper wallet or mobile wallet. It's a great service, especially for the UK where it's a fuck on with SEPA transfers for a lot of exchanges.

Took this opportunity to buy a little bit more, and also to move my money to Copay! 
Good advice, cheers man

Like fuck would he not have the ability to remotely access them.

I mean, they're also trying to create enough energy for the mass population in the North, I mean, who needs heat? amirite?

number 8 is the lucky number in China! (sorry if I missed a reference)

I used Bitcoin to avoid ridiculous exchange rates, and large fees, to move money from China to the UK. 
An example: I paid 1% to sell my bitcoin, which was £500. If I'd used PayPal I'd have paid (8% I think) £4000.
I dread to think what it would have been if I had used an international bank transfer with a Chinese Bank (which I would have exceeded the yearly limit for) or even had to look at the likes of Western Union
EDIT2: I have now put my money back into BTC. GG UK

If you've got a wife and child, I hope you've told them this!
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:52:20
So.... that's a no
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:40:23
If you read the OP, you'd know the answer
@_date: 2016-11-09 07:41:44
As soon as I woke up and saw the news (UK) I went and checked them price thinking 'it's probably shot up' 
Boy was I right.

Good shout out to Copay too. I prefer it over BW personally, but I know a lot of people go for BW

Building societies would be our version, surely? 
@_date: 2016-05-28 12:25:38
I'll join you in that! 
Haven't seen it in donkeys years
@_date: 2016-05-30 14:36:31
It is? News to me.

I live in China and I can shop online with both my Bank of China and Construction Bank cards without a Chinese ID card!
Another option, which you've already said no to, is to use WeChat Wallet on localbitcoins. You can top up your Wechat Wallet with your bank card and then use that to transfer to a seller. (Just giving you an option if you need it)

I'm actually thankful for your clarification.
He's still a fucking creep though
@_date: 2016-05-07 13:29:35
What a cunt
I tend to frown upon things that associate with pedophilia, but that's just my morality kicking in. Also, even when you have it explained, the joke is still shite! 
You're the one who is babbling like a fucking child because people think you're unfunny. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 15:47:40
Yeah, I get that! It's a pain in the arse moving rmb to gbp at the moment because of the spread!
@_date: 2015-11-14 15:37:48
It's a shame I wouldn't be able to get the day off! A day trip to Shenzen would have been great to learn more about bitcoin by talking rather than reading!
@_date: 2016-05-07 08:27:41
Doesn't even make sense you fucking creep
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:00:12
For small amounts go with Circle, but from what OP is talking about Circle may not have a large enough weekly limit? 
I've got a limit of £2.5k a week, just by asking to raise it
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:05:26
I'm gonna go to the Winchester, have a pint, and wait for this all to blow over
@_date: 2015-11-15 12:02:32
I'll be able to arrange that for sure! Cheers, I'll keep my eyes open 
@_date: 2016-07-12 22:14:04
Really? I'm super surprised! 
I had the app for about a day and asked for the increase and that was that
Got any other recommendations with low fees, that's not localBTC? 
@_date: 2016-07-12 20:38:05
Got my limits raised to £2000 by asking, try it yourself 
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:27:27
So edgy
