That's really very interesting...can you point me towards some material so I can look into it further?

Yes. Dear god...keep the freedom from me AT ALL COSTS! You're right...there is no one in the entire world who knows more about macro-economics than anyone else.
Freedom makes my peepee tingle. Help!

That's all I'm saying...there has to be trust. And in the case you just described your are still trusting a pseudonym...maybe it's a username on a forum or a public key...trust requires some kind of identity.
Also, thanks for mentioning the mailing list discussions. I'll check those out.

You cant get away from the fact that...at some point...you have to trust someone. You can't automate the need to establish relationships. That's why, in my opinion, the best you can hope for is psuedonymity...completely anonymous transactions are a kind of intellectual exercise. Even if you are just going by a public key value instead of a username then there is some kind of identifier that can be tied to some kind of reputation...which may vary in degree but has to exist.
