In many parts of the world the US$0.30 VISA transaction fee can buy you a full hot meal. You say "imagine", but it's reality for countries with a weaker currency than the US.

The "price" of a dollar is governed by the law of supply and demand. The supply is of course the money supply, and the demand is from the people wanting the dollar to use in economic transactions.
In normal circumstances, the government will control the money supply in response to economic activity. As the economy grows, so must the money supply grow.
In the case of Zimbabwe, the government printed a lot of money without a proportionate increase in economic activity, so the value of their dollar goes down. But if you print money proportionate the growth of the economy, then you don't get hyperinflation.

Intrinsic value means like gold that can be used as jewelry. 
Notice that that Wikipedia definition doesn't say that there must be a central authority. The community consensus to use bitcoin is considered exactly the same as the government's decree to use a national currency. Bitcoin is fiat.

Can you explain what advantages there are for a currency to hold its value constant? I guess it makes the jobs of historians slightly easier, because they don't have to readjust price numbers, but I can't think of any benefit in terms actually using that currency.
