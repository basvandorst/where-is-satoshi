For an end user, it equates to an ongoing saving of 0.5c every transaction. Since their not being paid anything, its a good incentive to reduce ongoing costs.


thats starts by removing the fee.


and tada, it is already on sourceforge, look all infrastructure completed.


false, it would be MultiBit. All FAQ's would be covered by multibit.

Ive been there buddy. Were your financial situation not so bad id say split and setup a buy around 500 or 400 (for the same amount of btc do not attempt to buy more) and a sell for the remaining btc at 1400.
Unfortunately it is money u cant afford to lose, so imho dont do the buy side of it.
Regarding your tennants, get them out and get new ones in on higher rates with a bond. Hell you could even advertise that you accept bitcoin and perhaps start building again at a rate you are comfortable with.

Either colbert plugs bitcoin and does it for the right reasons that matches his shows platform or he doesnt.  
Smoking bongs and jerking each other off in a drum circle is not going to help bitcoin.  
Its nothing about the war on drugs, but when bitcoins only 2 applications were gambling and illegal drugs - there was not much for him to promote.
And additionally, stop smoking fucking amphetamines - your ridiculously paranoid and you immediately assumed I was attacking your vice when I merely pointed out colbert had nothing positive to promote bitcoin with.

depends on what day you ask.  
Honestly bitcoin is still finding its niche, every time a weakness or inefficiency is found the start proclaiming bitcoin was never intended to be used for X then the next day when a large commercial seller of X wants to use bitcoin we start explaining to them how they can use bitcoin + Y to achieve what they want.
The truth of the matter is, until the network is faster and more efficient (higher bandwidth, cheaper hdds, etc) bitcoin is limited to 7 transactions a second. Bringing it to 14 will double the bandwidth required which people are reluctant to do at this point.
So in honestly, bitcoin itself will never rival visa / mastercard &amp; paypal for small quick payments though it was conceived to do just that, but bitcoin has proven useful for transferring large sums of money around the globe very quickly.
Bitcoin has its uses, but unfortunately the early dream of buying coffee &amp; beer with bitcoin (and only bitcoin) is not feasible with a larger userbase.

signing != encryption.
take pgp for example. I can create a new identify (like a bitcoin address) and sign messages with it.
I contact you the first time saying "hi boldra this is Jack, derpity doo".  
And sign the email message.
Now you dont know its me, but you know each successive message from that signature is from the same identify.
Assuming I let you know ahead of time I was about to send you a signed message you would then know its me and always me without myself having to reveal any identification via email.

look, can we just keep working on bitcoin and leave your shitty politics at the door.
The issue here is yours, you are trying to shoe horn your obvious agenda into a harmless bitcoin promotion.
You complain about the tech industry in general which should immediately let you know that your beef is not infact with this promotion but the world in general.
Bitcoin is decentralized by its very nature, you screaming at the herd to do what you want and admonishing them for not doing what you want is as effective as pissing into the wind.
How about, instead of attacking every red blooded male for going "ooohhh nice titties" (like we are programmed to do), offer an alternative.
If you cant grasp this concept, then you fail to grasp bitcoin.
Now Im not staying STFU or GTFO, Im saying that your bleating is pointless and is likely amusing the real chauvinists out there while the average guy is going "wtf is this chicks problem, she jelly ???".
What I am saying is there is nothing stopping you promoting bitcoin in your own way and hopefully setting the example for the rest of the community to follow.

Would you say someone is blameless for stealing something that was easy to steal in their position ? imho that is very naive.
I do agree on your other points, unfortunately thanks to ghash.io's obscene presence we are fast approaching the point where 1 confirmation is as reliable as a 0 conf used to be. I do expect 6 confirmations to be the absolute minimum in the near future, just need ghash to do a nastier attack and wait for people to say "well derp, you should accept less than 6 confirmations".

The Eligius pool is also famous for abusing its customers hashing power.
LukeJr has effectively doublespent altcoins on exchanges to destroy their value. Terracoin was his best effort where he built a longer chain from waaay back in the blockchain and transfered ownership of about 1/2 of all trc to himself so he could dump on BTC-e and vircurex.
Eligius is possibly the worst pool, following by ghash.io as both has flaunted their abused of power.
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:42:56


still not grasping that decentralization means there is no governing or community unless perceived.
Heres what I suggest, instead of thrashing against the tide, promote bitcoin in your own fashion and (hopefully) attract the more attention thus improving the ignorant public perception of "the bitcoin community" (a misnomer if I ever heard one).
This entire concept as been thrashed out, proven, demonstrated and the opposition defeated soundly if you consider the original silkroad complaints. Despite a very vocal minority and even several devs (ie lukejr) making loud complaints bitcoin, sr and bitcoins many communities carried on business as usual.  
In fact all the complaints achieved were free publicity for SR via the public drama.

People shouldn't buy bitcoin for an investment. Its beta, far to technical and easy to lose all your investment. The average pundit should stay far away from it.

ghash.io has over 50% of the network but its ok.  
ghash.io is abusing their power to double spend, but since its only casinos we dont care (fuck casinos mwhahahaha).  
ghash.io is now using their excess hashing power (anthing over 49%) to force other pools to have lower luck, its cool (dunno why).
ghash.io is a symptom of the greater underlying sickness that bitcoin is suffering.  
Imho they will be the end of bitcoin and the cause for complete loss in confidence.
my solution ? sponsor p2pool or abandon bitcoin in favour of a coin that prioritizes and rewards p2pool above all other pools.

1) you cannot prove your statement it is your personal opinion that you are masquerading as fact.

Some fields did (mainly tech related and of course porn), but many considered a passing fad.  
It took successful companies like amazon (originally just selling books) to start the massive shift where every business wanted in.


not sure what you mean by this, Ive been a Systems Administrator for the last 15 years working in the ISP field for the first ~8. The internet has been plagued by attacks, DDoS, and all sorts of issues, Ive seen company databases wiped (or worse stolen) by hackers, internet bills run up to the thousands for a single month by hackers again etc etc.
IPv4 really only manages to keep working because of all the extra help the protocol gets (cant wait for IPv6), without the special improvements offered by companies like cisco for their backbone routers we simply couldnt use the internet in standard IPv4 config without being overwhelmed by malicious third parties (and we still see mass traffic hijacking occurring occasionally).

the core concept of bitcoin is a decentralized trusted public ledger secured by proof of work that can be trusted absolutely but any peer connected to the network.
Nowhere is there "bitcoin should be used for charity"
do not confuse core concept with your ideals. That being said, there is nothing stopping you using bitcoin in the fashion you choose because it is a decentralized public ledger.
Id love to see a dedicated community/ sub-community in bitcoin that focuses on personal fund raising, if it would ever work is another matter (got your money for your cause ? sweet by community and so on till it dies is my prediction).


Wrong, the point of bitcoin is I dont need to trust you when confirming my transaction or relaying a confirmed tx. 
Im going to call you out right now, your all about money and not much else.


just amazing isnt it, you really do not grasp bitcoin. Bitcoin solves the lack of trust humans have for each other via proof of work and using greed + common interest (invested greed) as the motivator.

Indeed, its been my gut feeling for a while now that they manufactured and produced enough ASIC's to crush all the competition and ruin any ROI for their competitors (by driving difficulty up despite the cost to themselves).
I hope for a brighter future but atm Im seeing a trust less decentralized system centralized and requiring a large amount of good faith in the largest pool. Being a pesimist I believe ghash.io is actually a symptom of an inherent weakness in bitcoin that appears to have no immediate solution.

@_date: 2014-02-13 06:26:56
It will likely be included in the next solved block but this depends greatly on the miners/ mining pool software.
A good miner would do a first in first out queue for txids but we already know that higher fees = higher prioritization. So its quite likely that a mining pool even if it knew of the double spend would still permit it if the second txid had a higher fee simply due to the way the queuing system works.
edit: by permit i mean the pool would knowingly process the 2nd txid before the first even though they could see the same inputs being respent. If both txids are unconfirmed they are going to pick the higher fee one. With this in mind, the txmall issue/ attack could not benefit from this as it can only change the txid and not the fee or destination addresses.

@_date: 2014-02-16 05:29:19
Worth noting is the graph only tracks successfully rebroadcasts where they beat the race condition, there were many more that were invalidated after a couple of relays.
Im interested to see if we hard fork or not for a permanent resolution or we get an api upgrade ie all *txid* RPC calls are made redundant by *realtxid* RPC calls using the patch provided by mtgox.
My best example of why this was a rather serious oversight is still the:  
     bitcoind sendtoaddress 1XXXXX 
RPC method which returns a txid, with the current issue there is a tiny ( tiny^tiny^tiny ) race condition where if the transaction ID is mutated before you to a getrawtransaction on the returned txid you no longer have a usable reference to get the inputs spent, you could still however dig this information up by looking @ the destination address and seeing what payments were made at the same time you sent your payment.
As much as the devs squirmed on the issue there is no escaping the fact that what they called a txid was referenced and treated as such by their own reference client and documentation.
Im glad its been bought to light instead of being ignored (and silly blame placing games) because we need a permanent solution and I was thrilled to see blockchain.info add it so quickly. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:30:09
Hacker&gt; nope dont want you guys seeing where I sent my funds.
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:18:07


I disagree.


And thats why, bitcoind in the recent situation would return the payout txid then later fail to find it. If their support monkeys were careless they could have done several double payouts before becoming suspicious. bitcoind will kick out any invalid txid from the mempool (eg the txid has spent inputs from a txid included in the block chain). So they would of been in a perfect situation to be hit by this.


Not at all, its exactly the same - the only difference being how much if any they were duped out of.  
The bitcoin devs blaming mtgox's implementation was a red herring - the issue they reported was a real issue that should have either been resolved earlier or documented much MUCH better
     gavin&gt; lol derp, txid != txid until 6 confirmations so the txid returned bitcoind returns from its sendtoaddress rpc call is completely useless.
It does make me wonder though how bad the mtgox situation was, did their support staff just keep reissuing payments for 100's and 1000's of requests a day not thinking "gee this is a bit unusual, we are lucky to get 1 of these a day".

which is the very common attack, your 1st payment is made with 0 fees and if you have the skill as large as possible byte wise. The second includes just 1 of the inputs used in your first tx a generous fee (ideally the tx is as small as possible).
The first is bloaty and slow to relay while the second will rip through the network and be prioritized by the miners because of the fee.

hrmm I dont see the difference, p2pool users can set their own difficulty and the pool can enforce a higher minimum if required.
so generating 1000 shares vs generating 999 and withholding 1, im not seeing a large advantage at all, and it definitely does not make it any cheaper (still need to crunch your hashes).
pools could counter this by raising the min difficultly, it would make earnings more sporadic for smaller miners but reduce bandwidth.

\* 1) Not providing a correct and usable TXID.  
\* 2) Slinging shit @ mtgox in an attempt to deflect blame.  
\* 3) Referencing the txid all throughout the wiki and rpc calls as an actual usable txid.  
\* 4) Failure to provide a reference implementation for looking up txids (real txids).

ASIC's have put the network in the hands of about ~20 people Id estimate.
I honestly dont see a way out of this either, I think cryptocurrencies are currently doomed to centralization (which removes a lot of their value but not all), I hope to be proven wrong but Ive yet to see any solid work done to alleviate this issue.
Not counting PPC's PoS as its yet to demonstrate its effectiveness, there is supposedly a new altcoin that does implement a robust PoS coming out soon.
Sometimes the world needs a monumental failure so it gets pointed in the right direction again, I hope  that doesnt happen to bitcoin but, if it does Im positive we will see a better blockchain come out of it.

Completely False, the wiki clearly documents and uses the txid as the example unique reference, its only on a single page is transaction malleability highlighted as an outstanding issue.
Nice attempt to spin the story, but here is a tip - when spinning a story you need to stick to the facts and not fabricate your own.
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:15:15


And thats why you would suck at hosting and resolving bets. Your opinion Im afraid has no place here when defining absolute proof and outcomes.


You still fail to grasp that the outcome is unprovable.


Sorry if I have not made it abundantly clear already here is the scenario as I see it.
\* All but a very few bitcoin services relied on the txid as a transaction ID.  
\* mtgox was definitely hit and hit hard, Id assume all hot wallets emptied (lets pray they only kept 10% online).  
\* All bitcoin services that relied on the txid as a payment tracker (pretty much every service I can conceivably thing of apart from 1 or 2) would have been vulerable to the social engineering part of the attack.  
\* It makes poor business sense to admit you had funds stolen due to incompetence, especially with people like yourself leading active with hunts to discredit businesses with unfounded accusations.  
Mtgox got hit the hardest as they are the biggest target.  
For the other exchanges I cannot prove they were attacked any more than you cant.  
As there was a organized and planned attack to extract as much bitcoin as possible from vulnerable businesses it logic follows they attempted this on all exchanges and not just mtgox (the only exchange/ business to alert us of the issue in its current context).

Sorry if im coming across as a blunt dick in my replies but...
You shouldn't invest or gamble in anything if all it takes is a 25% downturn after a 25% spike makes you clueless regarding what to do.
So that being said, here is my 2c
Pick a split and do it asap.
Give notice to your tenants and explain politely (with the least amount of detail needed) your reasons.
A split is when you decide to reduce your exposure by selling say 1/2 or 2/3rds if your stock. You do this when you are unsure to reduce your risk snd exposure, trust me you will sleep better at night after doing it.

Id disagree there from my own experience of running a p2pool node.  
The cost of generating shares is the same, they simply with hold any high shares ie ( greater than 4 zeros). they still need to submit hashes with the minimum amount of 0's on the end thus requiring to churn electricity.
Please correct me if Im wrong, its been nearly a year since Ive mined seriously.

Sure you and qarl keep preaching that idea as its the only one that will shelter the bitcoin devs from some well deserved scorn.
The cold reality is they referenced a txhash everywhere as a txid, the reference implementation uses the txhash as a txid (it sendtoaddress returns a txid to reference the payment).

Agree 100%, and it seems fortunate enough no one apart from "silkroad 2.0" was stupid enough to setup an automatic repayment if the payout txid was no longer present in the mempool and the blockchain.


Well its possible Im right, I sincerely hope no one suffered losses and hope mtgox is still solvent "enough".  
Its been a pleasure discussing this topic further with you.
@_date: 2014-06-13 06:36:05


The only fuck up would be your own if you did something stupid like enter a wrong address.
Atm Ghash actually stands a good chance of reversing 1 confirmation and just over  3% chance of reversing a txid with 6 confirmations.
So Im not sure if your suggesting that ghash being able to reverse txids with a high success count is good or bad. If you want reversible  transactions you have the old fashioned banking system.
@_date: 2014-06-25 10:34:05
Agreed bitcoins theoretical dencentralized trust imho has been proven to be unsustainable
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:35:33


It does require it for security reasons if it is to be an effective P2P PoW system. The most popular system must be the most secure else it fails and becomes the least popular.
PoW fails when your P2P network has less power than the attacker, you use altcoins as an example, so then look at the attack on terracoin by lukejr. He brutally sodomized that altcoin while their devs cried in the shower.

You speak of a community, but the cold reality is bitcoin is made up of a multitude of communities. You attempt to alienate those that do not conform to your ideals and not simply ignore/ compete.


Bullshit, you were desperately toting around your investment, else figures would have nothing to do with it.


Whats this reasonable request, that they dont sponsor kickboxing ?
Or is it the simple fact an attractive girl in a bitcoin show outfit set you off.
You suggest they "framed" the post, but all I see in framing is yourself. 
Where is this inherit evil ?, is it because she is female ? gifted in the chest area ?, attractive ?, odd futuristic costume ?
Or is it because the fighters are not displayed yet because they are still setting up the tournament so they took the obviously popular photo op chance with the bitcoin show girl ?

Thats fine, when your exploiting something your happy if it works 1% of the time, because you script it and let it run.


Yes that seems very reasonable, mtgox had an additional problem that magnified their issue.


Yes due to their code specifically they were spending spent inputs due to the txid confusion. Bitcoind suffered a less critical issue where it would misreport the users balance (but not as drastic as mtgox's issue).
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:37:56
Yes who would have thought transaction ids could not be used to id transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:03:09
Yes I can though I have been told my LI5 part is not so good.... anyway.
When I send you some bitcoins I need a unique transaction ID to show that I have indeed paid you. The bitcoin ~~derps~~ devs incorrectly called a useless bit of information a transction ID and then proceeded to reference it as a unique ID in every page of the bitcoin wiki, source code and RPC Calls (how coders interact with bitcoind) all pointing to use of the txid as a txid.
2 years go by with this issue lurking and it becomes an issue due to people correctly assuming a transaction ID is a way to ID a transaction and referencing the bitcoins wiki's examples.
As it turns out, what is called the txid is actually useless and not a way to ID transactions.
So what happens is 99% of all services were coded referencing the bitcoin wiki and  they assumed (because they were shown so in demonstrations) that to confirm a clients payment you look up  the transaction ID and see how many confirmations it has.
What is happening now is nodes are changing the txid before rebroadcasting it to the network (and the network is flooded with bad nodes atm).
So mtgox pays your withdrawal and gives you a txid, you recieve the coins but the txid they claimed is your payment cannot be found in the blockchain so it looks like you were not paid. So people request you to reissue the payment.
For silkroad it seems they had an automatic system where if the txid is rejected from the mempool it is not counted as valid, so each time the txid was malformed silkroad would reissue the payment automatically thinking that their send had failed.
The rest is just noise from developers trying to shirk blame onto mtgox / every other service that referenced their client implementation and wiki. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:58:22


yes of course, thats what is a 2 year old bug the devs still have not come up with a solution for :P

The rest is just from a sinking feeling I have due to how several events have lined up.
My wild theory is bitfury practised scorched earth tactics previously not seen in the bitcoin mining community when they came online. I believe in addition to their double spending for business profit they drove the bitcoin hashrate through the roof to crush their competition who had yet to get to the chip density they had achieved. They did this to cut off all future revenue and cripple 2nd and 3rd round asic developments. They did this by distributing excess hashing power to other popular pools and their own private &amp; hidden (dynamic IP, not advertised) pools.
I was concerned enough when watching this unfold + the rapid centralization. I became more so when it was obvious not only do they practice extremely aggressive business tactics but they also decided to start robbing other bitcoin businesses.
As pessimistic as I am, I do hold hope. Bitcoin the idea is to valuable in its use to ever go away so I predict one of the following scenarios tacking place.
* Bitcoin adapts  
* Bitcoin devs &amp; community decide bitcoin network being controlled by 10-20 individuals is perfectly fine and "A new challenger appears" with a solution to bitcoins issue and the public votes with their wallets.

the issue with this noble idea is moores law, within 1-2 years asics will be 2-4-8x more powerful and private mining farms that are making a profit will be able to reinvest. They could even practice a scorched earth mining policy (which luke jr operator of eligius is famous for) where they drive the difficulty up despite already owning over 1/2 the network to force out the competition (bitfury and ghash.io did this to ASICMINER (my theory, unproven)).
So while good natured people like yourself a putting away with 1 unit, farms of those units are being deployed and refreshed at a rate faster than an individual can afford.

lol. Lets pretend you dont have a history and reputation for forking altcoins and bombing exchanges with the ill gotten gains ok :P 


The rules like bitcoin are unlikely to change unless a majority of the network agrees. I doubt users would update to support a forked rule change that put them at a disadvantage.


Have not seen that discussed myself, I'll look it up shortly.
My question stands though and I think you have already answered it. Bitcoin cannot defend against a selfish miner who has sufficient power to dominate the network.
Given that everything profitable will eventually be reduced to the most power efficient ASIC possible mining centralization is a forgone conclusion.
I think we will soon see a time come when anything under 6 confirmations is as reliable as a 0 conf transaction due to the centralization of mining power.

As frustrating as it was taking a 10% hit like I did (even more so with their support trying to pretend the was not an issue with $ withdrawals due to legal issues) I was able to shift my AUD out of there at a 10% loss by buying and reselling locally.

nah not at all brah.


Its a demonstrated concept with many examples inside and outside of bitcoin.


For the first 2 years bitcoin was a brilliant new product that many people failed to understand or comprehend. (I personally watched it for 1 year before dipping into it, sceptical but amazed).
Litecoin solved some peoples concerns regarding the simplicity of sha256 asics.
PPCoin attempted to solve the power consumption requirements (debatable if they really achieved the original goal).
I could go on if you want.


The technical benefits that a "no trust required distributed ledger" provides will far outlive bitcoin Im certain. 
You seem to fail to appreciate the very grand underlying technology and the extremely difficult task it solved.

@_date: 2014-06-13 06:56:51


well actually there is. Luke Jr famously attacked altcoins by building longer blockchains in private then releasing to reverse previously confirmed deposits on exchanges &amp; create havoc.


Its not "wrong" its simply not accurate, its a measure of luck more  than raw power, but number of blocks found / total blocks per day is not a bad indication of a pools performance when there is no better one available.
They could easily have 70% of the networks power and simply be having bad luck today, similarly they could only have 40% and be having a great day.

Sorry :) and to be fair I was actually thinking of distributed (admission of guilt !!!). When I was working back on ISP's in the late 90's early 00's DoS was our biggest worry and DDoS was a fairly new (and very difficult) problem to tackle.
Dynamic &amp; Distrubuted were both tossed around as terms before the industry (evidently) settled on Distributed for botnet brute style attacks.
For myself who had to tackle these attacks on an cisco as5200 dynamic seemed correct, for every block of IP's we/ telstra would shunt off a whole wave of new IP's would fire up and attack us.

He was the one that gave us an early alert to the DDoS attack using the same flaw, up until then it was just a "not an issue if you do XYZ" where now its a case of:
\* TXID's are useless and should not be trusted.... period, still waiting on the "official and real" transaction ID to be disclosed and updated in bitcoind so when a user runs:  *bitcoind gettransaction 1xhjihi9h0whatever* they can reliably get the transaction information instead of "oh well, that was never really an ID anyway".
\* Users payments can be lost if the recipient is using a common address due to the txid they see not being the actual txid used. This can be tracked by tracing the used inputs so its not the end of the world but 0 confirmation transactions are now completely useless for common busy addresses (say if Mc Donalds wanted to accept bitcoin and used 1 address per store).
The current situation is less than ideal, but I am thrilled to hear that they already have a "non forking" solution to non-mutable txids/ properly signed txids.

ok mr semantics, I work in IT and regularly deal with DoS and DDoS'es educate me.


To be specific Dynamic means constantly rotating IP's so blocking at an IP level is useless then yes it is a DDoS. It can be done with a single node but more effective with a group.
As I was helping several businesses deal with this over the last week I can definitely confirm it was Dynamic and not a static attack.


No, not at all. DDoS describes a Dynamic Denial of Service as opposed to the usual static method (single node). Yes it is common that DDoS and bandwidth flooding usually go hand in hand but it is not the bandwidth that makes it a dynamic attack.


In this case it was multiple nodes, it looked to me like a popular botnet was deployed with a lightweight bitcoin node to do specifically this attack. This is not and never has been a case of a single node broadcasting malformed txids, but mass amounts of nodes doing so.
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:57:05

as I said I really suck at ELI5 buuuut:  
The mempool (memory pool) is where all unconfirmed transactions reside, for example a bitcoin miner will grab all txids in its mempool and include them on the block they are working on solving. For clients like you and me its used to help detect double spends.
Once a txid is committed to the blockchain (think database) we dont need to track it anymore inside the mempool as now every node has a record of it. Unconfirmed double spends in the mempool are discarded as the blockchain now shows those inputs as being spent making the double spend invalid.

Irrelevant honestly considering she is a show girl. I haven't been to a convention yet where the show girls had name badges.
Yes it would be nice, but I think its a bit much to zero in on a single company because of it.


Now, here you do your own implication.
You assume they were refering to her as "this" and not:
* the outfit.  
* the promotion of bitcoin via show girls/ booth babes.  
* branding (A striking girl wearing a bitcoin logo).  
* promotion via event sponsorship (what I assumed).

**BITCOIN** and not "please give generously, we need money".


Now I have trouble taking you seriously, but I'll explain the difference.
Dorian was unfortunately made a public spectacle of due to bitcoin and him sharing a last name with the creators pseudonym. As a way of the community saying sorry for the unwanted attention that perhaps several key members (ie gavin) contributed to.
You are an individual asking for donations for yourself and your family.  
A noble thing certainly but a far cry from being relevant to bitcoin in anyway. How well do you think would receive a "help my family needs money but we will also accept silver" post ?
Im not trying to discourage individual efforts on charity as often its how new charities are started, what I trying to illustrate to you is:
\* you are breaking the subreddit rules.  
\* the rules are in place to prevent scammers copying and pasting your story (with a few name changes).  
\* we ask for proper charities because they are readily identified and we know how the fund will be handled. Lets be frank, perhaps you get all the funding you need and then some and decide to spend the excess on party... mean while another girl fighting for her life lacking funds dies....  
\* To support your style of charity run, would be over run entirely by posts soliciting donations and very rarely would we see discussion that related to bitcoin itself but posts like yours that are only concerned with bitcoin because it has value.
In addition to all this I have personally seen good people get conned into donating to a false charity and its all to often done exactly how you are doing yours (not accusing you of running a scam but how was I supposed to confirm in the first place).

People have the right to be offended, thats where it ends.  
Bitcoin is one of the best examples of free speech in action, sometimes it may get ugly, sometimes it gets fucking preachy (lukejr embedding bible verses in the blockchain) and sometimes it gets downright offensive (the links to child pornography).
But if we wish to have true an distributed public ledger that requires no trust to verify anything and everything in said ledger then politics must be left at the door.

IIRC with current block size limitations we can do a theoretical 28/s transactions.
The plan is to encourage of chain transactions (ie use of exchanges and services like coinbase) with imho is not a bad thing. I think until we have a better solution for transactions/ second scalable transactions and queueing will serve its purpose. For example, if your tx is so damn important include the current network recommended fee, else be a cheapskate and wait hours / days for a confirmation.

Cool but the article does not actually explain anything, just seems like a fluff piece for bitpay.
I'll take a look @ the mycelium source code, but here is my guess.
When you recieve a 0 conf txid you query each node you are connected to.
Say 2/10 nodes respond saying yes we have seen this txid and so far it seems valid, that becomes a 20% confidence.
Now the issue is, if the attackers work out your IP they can become the majority of the nodes you are connected to and give a false confidence. Still its a drastic improvement over simply accepting 0 conf txids.
If you had a list of trusted nodes, you could do this very securely but then you are centralizing your security on those nodes and if they become corrupted then its all over.

ok my simpleton here is the issue.
X is a payment company.
X decides to employ bitcon, that are very busy handling up to 1 client a second.
X pays clients and uses the provided txid as a reference to prove payment.  
Busy client gets coins but the txid provided does not match any in his wallet.
Client complains to X saying your txid never processed you have not payed me.  
X has MANUALLY by time stamps to match their broken txid to the now malformed one.
Its a flaw, fortunately not a breaking flaw but enough to make paying in bitcoin useless when using the reference client unless you patched it with mtgox's **real**tixd patch.

@_date: 2014-06-09 08:06:57
you are describing chains of unconfirmed txids which do happen (blockchain.info creates them regularly).
And yes, as you described because your 2nd txid uses the unspent change from the first txid and has a fee it attracts more attention. Miners cannot include your 2nd transaction without the first being confirmed as the 2nd depends on it.
That being said Im pretty sure the latest bitcoind's dont rebroadcast unconfirmed chains due to the spammy nature of it (or it is being tested at least).

Reduce, not solve but still I agree. Why they dont have at least a small team of devs that constantly review approved git commits in the bitcoind code base and heavily review its changelogs is a bit puzzling to say the least.


Not a publicly listed company, they have no requirements to do so until they receive a court order for not ordering client funds and even then its the court that sees it not the public. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:13:21
you really do not understand bitcoin do you Ilsound.
Let me educate your stupid ass on some key points you are missing terribly.
* Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no governing body only a set of protocol rules.  
* While fools like to think bitcoin is one giant community its not, it a large group of individuals and groups working together in a trustless fashion thanks to bitcoins blockchain.  
* Bitcoin works because people with differing views (and in your case political agendas) can use the system without needing to trust that some crazy feminist is going to refuse to process their transaction because its paying for a stripper.  
* You do not represent anyone but yourself, you certainly do not represent the imagined bitcoin community.  
* Bitcoin, money and commodties are a-political. A lump of gold does not care about your beliefs, neither does a bitcoin. It works just as well for evil as it does for good.
As I pointed out to you many times, your arguing based on a perceived slight against women and trying to argue as if bitcoin is a coherent community and you are someone a voice of reason in your imaginary community.
Instead of screaming at others for not doing what you want, how about you act like a mature adult and get back on with your own goal and please, dont let your goal be forcing bitcoin users to conform to your ideals, do something that has value.

Hi luke, nice of you to take a break from abusing altcoins to weigh in ;) 
So, what would the possible issue be for p2pool being the only pool ?  
from my limited understanding due to its nature of working on its own separate block chain it is in theory as robust as bitcoin is.
Would perhaps a solid 33% allocated to p2pool be sufficient (with the option to balloon to more ?
say for every 3 blocks (A, B, C) - A can only be mined by p2pool, B can be mined by any pool and C must be mined by a non p2pool node ?
Im keen to hear your thoughts because while I am a long time bitcoin supporter the recent rise of private asic farms coupled with selfish mining pools has me fairly convinced bitcoin is soon to be at the mercy of selfish miners.
You in particular demonstrated how nasty a selfish miner can be when they have sufficient power to overwhelm the network (terracoin) so Im curious to see how/ if bitcoin could really handle the same influx of power, my honest guess is that it cant with the current rules.

well its not part of any of the principles in the whitepaper.
Best to leave generosity to humans and not a protocol. Clearly the moderators disagree with you on your fundraising (again note the rules).


Then you are a wilful idiot which I have been suspecting you of for a while now.
This girl fighting for her life has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin, in fact you are being selfish to put her needs above the many others in a similar position. You are selfishly motivated to save someone you care about and are not driven by a "greater good motive".


because for some reason you refuse to read and follow the subreddit rules.

not any time soon my friend, here are my possible outcomes:
\* Liquidation, you get $100 per BTC as that was the price when mtgox filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy.    
\* Shared loss, mtgox has lost at least ~75% of client funds - they will reopen but all clients balances will be adjusted.   
\* Nothing happens for the next 2-8 years while mtgox is slowly dragged through international courts.

@_date: 2014-06-09 07:55:49


I dont like this argument which is "casinos deserve it" when people then make the argument for 0 conf being reliable.
Given they have demonstrated to abuse their power against the easiest social target and have had no negative impacts what is to stop them scaling up just a little more, why not hit several business with a 1 conf limit ?
Then finally why not try and own X countries exchange because we dont like X with a complete 51% attack on the blockchain (going back 6 confirmations).
Im sure your thinking "right, will never happen" and yet the above has happened (and worse) to smaller altcoins by mining pools that temporarily overwhelmed the smaller network and rewrote the blockchain.
There is nothing at all that prevents a bigger player coming onto the bitcoin scene and doing the same, if its not already happening with ghash.io who I think are testing the waters in what they can do with crushing confidence entirely in bitcoin.
Personally I believe ghash.io and other selfish miners (lukejr when he attacks altcoins) are a symptom and not the core issue.... that being distributed mining is not currently encouraged as it should be.
There is positive news on this front though, at least one business understands bitcoin enough to be attempting to donate to p2pool miners a % of their revenue thus providing incentive for distributed mining. I sincerely hope this becomes a strong trend and believe its one of the best ways to sponsor bitcoin in a healthy fashion.
@_date: 2014-01-11 13:23:12


in short, yes. To elaborate p2pool is designed that each person can be their own full node (just like bitcoin) the downside unfortunately is it requires bandwidth, CPU, storage and its also reasonably IO heavy.
p2pool does encourage heavy competition though due the relative ease of setting up a shared node to earn fees :)
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:38:33
LukeJr, Gmaxwell and the rest would carry on.
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:53:53
obviously GHASH.io is finally concerned enough about their bottom line to make the minimum effort to be seen doing something.

@_date: 2014-02-13 07:55:55


Prior to the block being solved and 1 of the 2 txids included they are both valid as 0 conf transactions.
Once included in a block only 1 can be valid and yes it is the pools choice which one to include, as pools a profit driven you can expect the higher fee to be included regardless of how well the other txid has been propagated.
The short answer: yes the pool gets to pick which 0 conf txid to inlcude.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:46:08

speaking of newcomers you must be one yourself.  
Yes we have seen this before, I was there to watch people screaming about deepbit exceeding 50%.  
The difference with this time and the previous is most of the hashing power aimed at ghash.io comes directly from a single private asic farm (bitfury).
We have about 4-8 people in control of over 50% of the networks hashing power.
Saying "every body swap" is hilarious because individual miners are fast becoming an insignificant part of the network.

hello qarl, Id like to address your argument here if I may. The issue that you are missing is the reference client used the txid as a unique ID.
The following RPC procedures all rely on the txid not changing:
     sendtoaddress  1ADDRESS AMOUNT
          \^ returns a txid for referencing the payout later.  
     gentransaction TXID
     getrawtransaction TXID 1 
Its a protocol flaw / reference client implementation flaw.  
You sound like a SDM trying to explain away a PR disaster but Im a tech engineer :P

Your not really clear at all mr semantics.
First, you lampoon a quote because it refers to busybox + linux as a OS, which together they most definitely can be.
Then you argue it is not an entire userland ? exactly what is. busybox is capable of driving iptables, managing disks, kernel modules and file operations. I can name many operating systems that have the same limited feature set.
If you want to get all semantically about it the OS could be called "Busybox Linux" in the same fashion that we have "GNU Linux", but Id question ANYONE faulting a reporter for calling linux+busybox a slimmed down OS which is exactly what it is.

false, for example large txids with a 0 fee may never meet rebroadcast requirements to get sufficiently broadcasted for a non discriminating pool like p2pool to pick it up and include it.
@_date: 2013-09-23 01:21:35


Ive seen new casinos make this fatal mistake as well.
Instead of:
     max bet = balance /100
they should be doing
     max payout = balance /100
for safety and imho 1% is still not a safe operating area. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:25:51


That is 1 method, another is to do an extremely complex tx with the minimum fee. Broadcast it poorly, then reuse the same inputs in a simple tx with a large tx fee, the miners do the work for you by prioritizing the simple tx with the high fee over the complex low fee tx.
As an additional benefit, the complex fee takes significantly longer to broadcast increasing the likelihood that it will be beaten by the simple tx in getting confirmed and broadcasted.

**Many many many times**, in fact the blockchain spam from SDice enabled secondary attacks against many other bitcoin services - the most noticeable one being crackdice.


IMO your opinion is bullshit, there is a good discussion thread on this in the forums if you really want to share your 2c.
SDice needlessly put insane levels of stress on the network resulting in:
* Hurried patches.  
* An epic blockchain fork due to the hurried patch to address the SDice issue.  
* Removal of ability to send under 0.00005 BTC (not a bad thing honestly atm).  
* mining pools and now even bitcoin clients running blacklists against SDice addresses.

honestly as an semi old timer I did have misgivings about this as well, then I read his business plan (parts that have been disclosed) and observed his performance over the last ~10 months.
The conclusion is, BTC is nuclear arms race indeed, except Friedcat is America 2013 vs the rest of the world working in the 50's. I am committed to BTC for the long haul so despite my unease about this situation i am a realist and I know which team I want to be on.

This has been true for as long as bitcoin was traded for money.
If sort of thing really does concern you then I think PPCoin is the coin of your dreams.  
Gavin and all the other bitcoin devs were pretty much giant dicks towards Sunny King while he was working out his new PoS concept. LukeJr and others made several attempts to hack it, That unstable idiot smoothie when on a massive disinformation campaign.
And yet, here we are - approx 1 year later as the only successfully sha256 based altcoin that handles with ease massive swings in hash rates.
It could be that your concerns do come to see the light of day and bitcoin (and all PoW based crypto currencies) fail. 
I always thought PoS was an excellent innovation and felt that the vocal detractors who apparently couldn't read Sunny King's own code but happily combed through Satoshi's code had obvious agendas.

Wait another 4-6 weeks.

S) Sorry new buyers have a limit of 10.  
B) Oh, ok what is the max I can buy off you.  
S) 10.......  
B) Oh, ok. Can you meet me here (location of dodgy place I have never been before, usually out of site from main roads etc).   
S) Sorry, as the advert says I work at X and can meet you at the pub across the road called Y.   
B) Oh.... ok. What do you look like, when can I meet you.   
S) I look like X, wearing Y and will be accompanied from 1 of my co-workers for security. Meet us at the bar and we can have a beer while we do the exchange.  
B) never responds after realizing I wont go to his preferred location and that I will be in a public location that has security and be accompanied by a friend + witness.

Forced lower than default via the feature in the java bitcoin lib, the lib has now updated as well due to its lowest possible txfee no longer being accepted.


Incorrection, this is merely your assumption.


chains of unconfirmed txids relying on SDice bets being processed with the final link in the chain being targeted at crackdice. A fault of crackdice as much as sdice though, sdice just happened to enable this exploit (accept your risks when accepting 0 conf txids).


Gavin is entitled to his opinion - its not unanimous even among core developers.


Yes, Im not arguing businesses put money first, specifically Im arguing that is his motivation above all else.


Entirely disagree as many others do.
Now, kindly un-knot your frilly panties and accept there is a difference of opinion on these topics and WHOOP DE FUCKING DO - GAVIN SPOKE, unlike many I hold him in no higher regard than any other individual - except when specifically dealing with the code of bitcoin.
Bitcoin IS a democracy. Hence the 'spam' filtering patches and the lack of universal agreement on all topics. 
Well done on Erik for making a ludicrous profit via a well timed investment and very smart business tactics, I cant argue or fault any move he has made as business man, infact I think its quite admirable from a financial risk vs reward perspective.
For the longest time I was a defender of "sdice spam" until it became obvious the network in its current stage would not support the business at its current growth. Many options were available for SDICE to reduce traffic without changing the business model and they certainly could have afforded it. Instead they chose to do nothing and see what the system could bare, its for this reason I do not consider sdice a good bitcoin citizen. Of course all this is relative, what I consider a good bitcoin citizen others do not.
Fortunately it seems as bitcoin matures, so has its gaming platforms with most if not all the latest games offering provably fair "off the blockchain" betting.

what you are ignoring is the fact with the amount of power they have they can successfully double spend one 1-2 confirmations by building a longer chain and submitting it.
Even now with their 37% they have an extremely unhealthy amount of power considering their reputation.
    conf  chance of success
     1     37%
     2     13.69%
     3     5.065%
     4     1.874%
     5     0.693%
     6     0.257%
So my core concern is thus:
ghash.io is run by crooks, who have no interest in bitcoin besides squeezing every last drop of profit out of it before collapsing the market.
They already have enough power to achieve these attacks.
imho a sha256 based crypto coin cannot survive in this environment, I hope ghash.io and every one of their workers are hit by a metorite.
I despise the selfish parasitic actions of these assholes.

It would require a hard fork which I cannot see surviving in the current climate or future climates.
Why would you ever want to print more of something if you already have the market conquered (eg the FBI's ~0.6 mill BTC).
Think of it this way, you have 6 of 210 original Superman  comics.
You want more money, do you ask everyone holding a comic to duplicate it and sell as the original ? Knowing that it would do more than halve the value of your original comic as buyers have now lost faith in the number in circulation ?
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:43:39


actually no, its the clients not the miners. Im certain with the right support it would receive heavy adoption and many litecoin miners would "come a running" to mine some bitcoins again with their GPU's.
If the client is updated, any pools that do not fall in line create their own fork of the blockchain. If most the users (not the miners) are on the new chain they lose profit and will swap.
@_date: 2013-09-23 01:13:19

Its true you are very ignorant.
@_date: 2013-09-06 00:08:10
it just works :)
All this talk about "bitcoin debit card" etc etc and one has existed for over 2 years. 
They even used to accept direct btc deposits until someone thought he had managed a double spend during the big 0.7x and 0.8x split and made a massive circle jerk out of it. Turned out his double spend was unsuccesful and it also prompted okpay to drop btc.
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:44:20


No, what has likely happened is you have used a common dictionary word or phrase and your brainwallet was guessed via bruteforce.
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:14:01
mind still firing off ideas despite desperate need of sleep, anyway this solution would require 2 difficulties due to the difference in nature of the 2 algos but imho it would be a trivial addition.

Are you seriously telling me you do not have cash / bank account ?
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:40:01


No, it is not a warning. It is a law, bitcoin cannot be used as a payment method.


yes and the same for America, Australia, United Kingdom etc etc etc.


They will not be able to advertise accepting bitcoin, but they could discretely still do so but the question then becomes is it worth their time and effort.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:44:36
I had the "pleasure" of talking to a coinlab rep on the forums when they were floating their original idea.
Here it is: Pay gamers to use their GPU, take a 50% commission on bitcoins earned and sell the other 50% and send to the players paypal account.
I queried why any gamer would do this as they would likely google bitcoin themselves and realize they could make more money themselves by mining on a pool. They argued that the average user would be happy to pay the 50% for the convenience of not tweaking mining software and going through the trouble of selling the bitcoins (it was a lot more difficult back then).
They never even finished the software and it seems paypal was not going to deal with them anyway despite their claims. Despite those 2 glaring issues I think the idea was sound but the planned fee was outrageous. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:12:06
its how I ended up going :)
It went from 1 of my co-workers investing nearly a year ago to me becoming the go to guy to buy bitcoins off or get USD into btc-e.
Worked out great, zero stress and I was able to help my friends get started, and as an added bonus as you said I ended up sitting on a large amount until recently when the price sky rocketed and I decided to cash out :)
@_date: 2013-07-08 08:21:42
there is no such thing as bad publicity my friend :)
@_date: 2013-07-08 07:37:01
oh I do acknowledge this.
What made me decide to invest was realizing how much money friedcat makes by simply doing what he told people he would do.
Its similar to BTC-e, they make an excellent income being honest and they have continued to do so for over 1 year.
It still is a calculated risk, but at this point far better than an unknown.
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:36:32


indeed, the only thing effected is the distribution of mining power and pools due to the different hardware requirements.
and yes, as you said, the idea is scalable, we could add more algos if the need arose in the future.
@_date: 2013-09-06 11:18:44
If i were the head of paypal and planning on making a pro btc announcement I would let my inner circle of investors know ahead of time.

Im intimately familiar with the topic Erik.
SDice only started paying fees and adjusted their min send AFTER the network forced the situation, right up until that point you were content to watch the network be loaded until breaking point provided your profits kept rolling in.
Now as a business man I admire this move, being selfish and putting profits above all else is what its all about after all, but as a bitcoiner I think you were nothing but a parasite who gave nothing back.

Its true, I bought into ASICMINER after yifu was complaining concerned customers waking him up in the middle of the night.
Friedcat has it so easy, we have :
* Yifu who is turning into BFL_Josh  
* BFL which imho is about to have a critical meltdown any day now.
All he has to do is
* not rip people off   
* not be an arrogant asshat   
* Deliver within weeks in target date and not Months/ years.
and he comes out smelling like roses 'mmmm friedcat fresh'.

It will, and people holding large amounts will have to take the extra steps required to secure their asset. Just like how mints dont use a cheap safe, they invest heavily in their safe and security.
For smaller amounts (say under 10 btc) I think a strong password + 2FA + all automatic backups disabled is good enough.
@_date: 2013-07-04 12:04:42


yes, as many times as you want :)


yes, but I do recommend at least using a password protected zip file (ie 7zip) with a very strong password.
I believe blockchain.info will let you import an elecutrum wallet, so that could be a good 2nd option.


It still pays to be very careful, many malware now sweeps your drive for btc wallets, I know OSX has a far better reputation for this but even linux gets the occasional virus.
the bitcoin wiki is quite helpful on many of these topics, not that I mind answering them.

@_date: 2013-11-13 16:43:53
Now, ignoring your little cry I shall explain further.  
Bitcoin transactions are non reversible by design of the protocol, the fact that you can occasionally (rarely) with the right circumstances double spend a tx and beat the first is not by design and not a checkbox you can tick or anything so simple.
So what you are asking for is a 0 confirmation doublespend script OR you really do not understand the concept of bitcoin.

I have a similar sentiment, I saw the price soar up to 5+ btc a share and thought "this is fucking crazy".
3.5 BTC is an optimistic price if you believe in the future of ASICMINER and understand reward halving. Anything under 3 id be happy half spending my dividends on.
It is for these reasons I expect the price to hover about 3.5 btc ea (the universe is spiteful and does not want me to buy more).

@_date: 2013-11-15 02:07:25


He spends enough time in China... and runs a chinese business. Its only going to take 1 well connected person in china to call up their local corrupt govt official and Yifu will likely disappear along with all the equipment and bitcoins. 
If he is american then this is very good news, he is only 1-2 years away from a class action law suite which will likely end with his company being ordered to repay bitcoins he mined on investors equipment. 


Regretfully that is the world in general.
I remember SCREAMING at forum users regarding pirates ponzi, BFL Preorders and even your own BFL bet. 
Nope, people throw common sense, decency and honsety out the window when they see $$$. This is how most scams operate, you are relying on greed to overwhelm common sense.
The real issue I see is pricks like Yifu and (previously) Pirate thumbing their nose at the law and their clients/ investors as they assume "its bitcoin, I can do whatever I want".
My guess is in another 1-2 years Yifu will be in a cell right next to Pirate getting his ass rammed by Bubba. When this does happen I plan to set up Bubba with a QR code tattoo so we can tip him for "looking after" yifu.

OK buys and sellers you need to beware.
In this situation where the customer will be buying there is little risk. Get your btc and send the paypal.

no, the issue here is private asic farms not pools.
@_date: 2013-10-21 03:10:04
Who will buy them when they can only mine back 0.25 btc ?
I still own 50 shares in AM, I was able to sell all near the top and rebuy on the way down making these 50 shares pure profit so Im a long term speculator still.
Pretty sure friedcat screwed the pooch on this though, his first success was due to the absolute incompetence of the competition. Now that he is lagging and facing very hard competition I dont predict he can catch up.
tinfoil hat time - This epic leap in hashing power is 1 or more unknown entities that are hashing up to 40-70% of the network with their asic farms distributing the power amongst pools. They are playing scorched earth here, the goal is to ensure (which they have) that AM and other mining companies cannot operate their farms at a profit anymore ensuring they cannot afford to reinvest, all the while the build up an epic supply of bitcoins and create an artificial shortage.
Accusation time - Yifu the latest scam artist has a farm running of avalon chips funded by pre-orders, use of clients mining equipment and made up delays. Investors boot strapped avalon, it made some crazy profits and the cunt in charge took it all in house and shafted his investors.

Its also about catering to your clients as a whole and not a single entity.  
Back when you bought SatoshiDice 250 BTC was not worth what 100 BTC today is.
There will be less and less whales stepping up for those 100+ BTC bets, this another cause for the increase in variance (less frequent whaling).

heh heh heh, the issue with this popular theory is that it assumes they are holding the bitcoins they mine.
They are making the bet that people will support bitcoin despite abuse.
Really they can push the limit as hard as they want provided they cash out profits regularly.
With this in mind and Im certain that their business is already in the green they will simply scale up their attacks testing what the market will bear. ATM its "hey so what if their exploiting gambling sites, they are stupid to use 0 conf" while ignoring the very real issue that the largest miner in bitcoin is all to happy to abuse their power.

he and his group did create the scrypt miner (ltc) and apparently it was no mean technical feat doing so. His code does seem to be "solid", but like many coders he seems to lack PR skills in managing his coin releases.
You can catch him on the chat doing admin support, he is quite regular.  
I wouldn't buy into any of his coins or many of the other dubious altcoins but so far I do like the exchange.

actually in this specific scenario it does, ghash.io's power comes from ~~KnCminer's~~ BitFurys private farms, imho they are likely one and the same company.
Prior to dedicated asic farms we had a much more even and dynamic distribution of hashing power, now we have static consildation.
So to steer the topic back to my point, im not arguing about pools I am all for them, they enable small miners to contribute in a meaningful way.
the issue is when one small company can fart out stupidly cheap hashing power and overwhelm the network.
sha256 in particular is a very simple algo to convert to a scalable asic thanks to its 0 memory requirements (all the work can be done via registers).

Im going to stop you right there my immature friend. Consider this a free tip in life, one that you really need to consider.
When you find yourself, defending your stupid fucking claims / questions and have to resort to "assumed authority by age" you lose all credibility.


I was mining back when the coins were less than $5 and ASIC's were just a dream - I have no need of any advice from a twat who wonders about the morality of "priced to what the market bears".

@_date: 2013-12-21 15:12:06
Im sad to say that I sincerely think private ASIC farms like KnC + Ghash.io &amp; BTCGuild will be the nail in the coffin for bitcoins confidence.
Reading the thread, it does not just look true - it is provably true.  
A major mining pool has (by lax security or design) exploited another bitcoin service by taking advantage of their network share.
This does reaffirm the need for a minimum of 1 confirmation and ideal 6 for absolute security but I fear if and when the  main stream media catches wind of this it will be enough to scare away new adopters.
IMHO its never been a better time to be hedging your bets with Litecoin, for no other reason than so it seems litecoin is still currently asic resistant despite its **very weak** scrypt parameters.
People are saying that the mining farms would not do this as it would damage their own investment, I think we are underestimating human greed and foolishness (in the old meaning of the word fool). With enough power behind you and a clever plan you are unlikely to get caught (at least this is what they will assume) then by rationalizing the idea that you wont get caught + MORE BTC...... its actually very easy to see this happening.
More so when you consider they are likely making a similar bet "people wont abandon bitcoin even if I am caught because they are to heavily invested".
The logic may not sound reasonable to a even headed fair person but alas, the world is made up of many types.

I will say that the bitcoin foundation organize the refunds from the last blockchain split and funded a few other useful legal inquiries etc.
The issue I have is that the foundation is that its run as an "Old boys club", you pay to get in, some very dubious people are already members and it basically operates in secrecy.
It strikes me as a self serving group that aim to make bitcoin their political platform, bitcoin will likely benefit from their actions (most the time) but only because they have calculated their is a net gain for themselves personally.

So your new scenario involves bitcoin being fatally flawed, are you going to keep adding conditions until you get the answer you want ?
Anyway........If all cryptography is suddenly broken resulting in bitcoin being unable to be forked to a secure algo then to be honest the world will have far larger issues than bitcoins value plummeting.
Assuming just something as simple like a sha256 weakness is discovered difficulty just increases rapidly. sha256 broken ? we fork from the last good block.
ESCADA Broken ? Bitcoin was fun while it lasted, rush to mine the next coin using a new public + private key encyrption algo.

Thanks for the stats, much better than my rough estimates.
Getting ~80% of that total will take ~10 years (2-3 more halvings).
And yes, then there is of course hardware sales and txfees. It is why I bought a large chunk at 1.6 and again at 2.2 and plan to hold for ~10 years. At this value its a reasonably safe investment with high liquidity. I couldn't make the same argument for the current price though.

Just be patient and 1 of 2 things will happen.
1) Your wallet will rebroadcast the tx after ~30min and it will get picked up and confirmed.
2) The network will reject your tx for whatever reason and your wallet balance will correct.

that aaand the simplicity of sha256, you simply cannot build 37% of the network so easily given the complex circuit requirements. Its non feasible in todays climate.  
Sure that could change in the future, but it would be a solution for today.


I agree, I think bitcoin/ whatever its successor is must be an adaptive technology. imho sha256 is to simple and cheap to mass produce, we should have seen this issue with ASICMINER but friedcat is a bitcoin believer and runs a decent well behaved company so we were lulled (I was at least) into a false sense of security.

Spendbitcoins is also good, but their premium is fairly high.
Also localbitcoins.com
For selling I use 
mtgox + bank wire as they still have the best rates but slow.
or  
BTC-e and okpay (sign up and get a debit card), its much quicker but the rates are so so.
Im also considering simply swapping to silver as a cash out mechanism as I work fairly close to the perth mint :)

long story short, because I did not add his new site to the gambling list within a week he went on a campaign against me stating that I had unfairly rejected his site.
All this while Im out sick and dealing with many other things.  
Every other casino operator has been good, this guy tries to bully his way to the front of the line, then when ignored (or enough time simply has passed for the other party to respond) he starts spreading lies.
The site itself does look good imho, but for a new casino operator to be sending PM threats and then making up lies about someone who maintains the gambling list off his own back is unacceptable.
edit: also if thats the way he handles getting listed on a free service Id hate to see how he resolves any issues a client may have.

So each time you turn on the system your vulnerable to infected lan PC's and its a race to see if you get exploited before you catch up with windows updates.
Dont do this, you do have the right concept but pick an OS family that doesn't have new exploits found every other day.

Here is the thing about SA, as someone that has observed it from the start.  
SA, was relevant at one point on the internet. Now its just a slowly dwindling forum of angry psuedo neckbeards that are pissed that their glory was small and fleeting. 
IF SA is angry at you, then you can pretty much relax knowing that the worst social network on the internet has taken issue with you, its kind of like a compliment (Its like WBC saying they dont like you). SA has a habbit of going from rampage to butt hurt rampage when they realize no one outside their forum gives a fuck what they think.

actually the paramters for litecoins scrypt implementation were extremely weak and many guessed (including myself) that they were chosen by litecoins creator so he to mine on GPU's while everyone else was busy cpu mining.

For me it was a small but not insignificant amount, the issue was my 2 friends who were just dipping their toes into bitcoin mining got screwed and kept getting screwed.
You dont really want to see 2 good friends take the plunge and get fucked over royally and then continue to get fucked over for 4 months while being fed various BS excuses for fake delays.

Ive been watching that with some interest myself, I do expect there to be some heavy fines because of this regardless if the cause was ignorance, but not jail time. He is not even a US citizen, he is a French expat residing in Japan and the business is a Japanese business.
The worst the US can do is throw a tantrum and be as obstructive as possible by seizing assests - definitely seems to be their chosen course of action so far.
The real question everyone is asking is exactly how much money was seized and was it enough to impact their business.
mtgox and another BTC individual have made statements that they are solvent and the current limitations are due to their new banking partners being overwhelmed by the sheer volume they wish to process.

I asked my better half this same question (she is from South China).  
In her and her friends opinion, the bitcoin loophole worked best for the goverment (where most the corruption is). It served as an ideal way for corrupt politicians to shift money out of the country.
Her guess was they would let it run wild so they could move their ill gotten fortunes to another country then clamp down on the exhanges..... which is exactly what happened.

police report all to often count for jack shit. Anyone can go in and tell them a story - if they can't prove your lying you are fine.  
Now with that considered, the sms's can be verified by the police - if the buyer has gone and made a false statement they will catch it.
So the question is, is the buyer really dumb enough to give a police statement with provably false information which will get him a conviction all for $700 worth of bitcoins ?
My suggestion would be to contact the buyer and the police. State you would like an audit from his telco provider for the messages in question (the telco can do this on a clients request). If the buyer refuses to comply then you do have a red flag for him. Otherwise you get the sms'ed verified and prove the seller is a scammer.

I like how you think this excuses your selfish exploitation of the network.  
That being said, charitable donations are a good time (tm) regardless of the source of funds.
As for myself, an individual that has not profited via exploitation - I have donated ~100 btc from my own personal funds. Still as I said, I was not busy raping the network and ignoring the developers and greater community due to my own personal greed.

why ?
Why would anyone rush to buy an unstable commodity that has gone from $1000 to $200 in one week.
Anyway, the reason I think it is possible is because china originally pushed use past the last ATH. Regardless it seems the news is not as bad as people make out though, you can still buy and sell BTC in china, but only through the countries official bank.

Hi stephen :), I to have been doing the maths and believe there is a hard limit on the stock price when valued in BTC.
Lets use your 2.6 mill and ignore hardware earnings and assume AM has a flawless run maintaining 20%:
20% of 2'600'000 = 520,000 BTC mined in 2 years.  
520,000 BTC / 400'000 shares  = 1.3 BTC per share
2 years = 1.3 btc / share.
next 3.5 years = 0.65 btc / share
next 3.5 years = 0.325 btc / share
next 3.5 years = 0.1625 btc / share
approx 2.4375 BTC can be earned per share over the next ~12 years from mining only.
Which is a ~50% return and still quite good imho.
Now, at this point though what would be the value of AM shares given the drastically reduced ROI ? Could a person who bought at 5 btc and held for 12 years hope to sell at 5 btc ? I dont think so myself unless BTC has reached what I call "critical liquidity".
Add income earned from selling hardware sales though and the valuation at 5 btc is not that outrageous if they can maintain that 2nd income revenue.
