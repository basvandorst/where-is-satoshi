Trading fees go to miners?

I just can’t believe we’re still stuck at 15k. What the hell is going on...we should be at 20k by now.

It’s because transaction times are too long to arbitrage the difference. It would be nearly impossible to buy BTC on one exchange and send it to another exchange fast enough to remove the risk of the price changing. 
This causes buyers and sellers to be stuck on the exchange they hold the BTC. If more people on an exchange want to sell than buy, the price will drop quicker than an exchange that has buyers. 
You can sell your BTC for a quicker transaction crypto like ETH, LTC, or BCH but that causes those  prices to go up. Also the ratio between BTC and other cryptos stays relatively the same between exchanges so there isn’t much arbitrage opportunity.
Hope that helps!

�� ahh shit this ones gold, $26 and they emailed support for help. 
In the future, read up on what you’re buying. As for now, it sounds like you need to deposit more money to get to the minimum limit. 
Cex.io also trades Ethereum, look into that.

You can’t 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:35:06
Yes, the world will stop.

Ive been waiting for posts like this and here they come! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:58:21
Congrats friend. Glad you didn’t toss it!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:58
It’s erased. 200B hasn’t been traded. This market isn’t a zero sum game. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:51:32
You just discovered $11k...you tell me how you feel. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:42:33
This is normal behavior in times of large price movement. Just stop looking at it and relax. It’ll show up within the next couple of days I’m sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:48:51
Ahh yea, free limit orders. Add “free” transfers out of GDAX and you have a formula to lose money. Interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:35:23
Yea, Eth is known for its massive pump and dumps. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:53:31
Maybe not rational. Emotion definitely played a part in both selling and buying back in. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:54:23
That's why prospectus exist. It's a legal document explaining the risk of investing prior to buying. Who is the SEC to say an investment is too risky when they allow ETFs that state in their prospectus they will lose money if held long term. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:17:09
Haha you can't really say risk is a problem when 3x leveraged inverse ETFs exist. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 00:04:33
Cool, I'm just saying it'll be bullshit if the SEC claims risk was a deciding factor in its decision to not approve. Hopefully we don't even need to worry about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:41:04
Exactly thank you for the clarification :) 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:34:12
Why is it impossible to sell?  Bittrex seems to be selling just fine? 
NVM, found the answer. Exchanges aren't accepting new transfers in and trading is only occurring on the limited amount of BCH that forked on the exchange. 
Doesn't stop selling if you had BTC on an exchange and got BCH as well. Just wouldn't want to be in BCH when the exchanges start taking transfers in.

There was plenty of mainstream media last time as well.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:41:09
Did you buy again at 6.2k? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:32:34
“Bitcoin will be the base layer on which future applications are built, which include super low fees, smart contracts, and private chains.”
I think there is already a much better chain than bitcoin that does this already; Ethereum. Bitcoin is behind the times in that market.

Like the manufactured euphoria that enticed others into buying? We call them bag holders. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:03:15
Correct, but it will be tough to hold this. This BTC dump will scare a lot of new comers from buying and anyone new who bought over 6k will probably be selling. With BCH almost impossible for newbies to buy, the  total of BTC and BCH could tank. 
Also, if BCH does indeed take over, odds of CME opening futures by year end is slim to none. Hell, after the BX2 future fiasco and this dump, it might already be called off.

Another day, another fuck me Jesus moment.

Gotcha. Yea, the 1099 really doesn’t mean anything except telling the IRS you were trading. If they get the 1099 and then see that the individual didn’t provide any additional tax info on the trades, I’m sure the big ole red audit flag gets waived. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:15:31
Any trade from crypto to fiat is taxable. Did you trade BTC to ETH or vise versa at all? If so, did those transactions show up? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:07:27
Trust me, 100% any trade from crypto to fiat is a taxable event in the United States. You only pay taxes on gains, and can deduct loses if you have them. The deduction amount is capped at $3k a year though. It’s the same as selling a stock. 
The cost basis is based on FIFO, LIFO, or average cost. FIFO is the default for the IRS. It is the traders responsibility to pay the correct taxes. 
The only gray area in 2017 and before that was crypto to crypto exchanges and if they were “like kind”. Like kind means you don’t pay taxes until you sell to fiat. 
That gray area is gone now in 2018. The IRS has now said any crypto to crypto trade is a taxable event. That means all alt trading is taxable the minute you sell to BTC or ETH. The minute you buy an alt, you’re selling BTC or ETH and that’s now taxable as well. It’s going to be a nightmare. 
Because the IRS said this was starting in 2018, I take that to mean it wasn’t taxable in 2017 so I am not reporting crypto to crypto trades. I also never sold to fiat in 2017.
Basically, it’s on us to provide to correct documentation to the IRS. Any crypto to fiat transaction ever has always been taxable. On Jan 1, 2018, any crypto trade at all is a taxable event so keep track of every single trade. Fun stuff.

He saying any O (zero, or uppercase O) you have is a lowercase o. Any I (lowercase L or uppercase i) you have is a 1 (number 1). Good luck
