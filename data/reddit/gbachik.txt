You hit the mark right on the head!
I've considered lowering fees but at this point its just not in the cards :/
Maybe in the future!

Sorry! I reposted this because I was able to substantially lower the fee! It's only 5% if you invite a friend! Perfect if you don't have a bank etc.

Understandable and you shouldn't since an exchange requires a valid bank and holding time. While we offer an exchange type service we are not an exchange.

Thanks! ^.^
I'm doing my best to lower the fee too!
It's just not possible right now.

I didn't understand what caveat emptor meant at first and fixed my response. There's no reason for me to reply to flame posts. If you don't believe my service is real don't use it. Nobody forcing you. There's no need to get all upset and use fowl language. -thanks

Currency exchangers commonly charge 15-20% to exchange bit coin to things such as paypal. Why is this any different? It's what they're already doing but better!

If you have a decent amount of cash yes!
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:02:21
Hahaha! I guess you'd always win that way ;P
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:29:57
Its mainly for people who don't have a bank account or don't wish to wait for days to have their coins transferred

You are entitled to your own opinion
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:47:48
You can't chargeback bit coin so its no problem :P
Any debit card issues are dealt with by the third party provider issuing the cards.

Perfectly understandable but I can assure you this is 100% real.

I agree :]
