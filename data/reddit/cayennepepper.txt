Last july i thought the dame. £600 felt a lot. I wanted to wait for a dip. Maybr back to 500. Do i spent 100 only for the time being for 0.2btc.
Now im kicking myself. In fkr a penny in for a pound.
Point is you will regret it if it rises. Just dont invest what you arent willing to lose. Every time it rises that gets harder.

Because they have the idea of traditional fiat cash in their head still, where full “dollars” or “pounds” are solid reference points of value.
If bitcoins were denominated in a lesser sub value more commonly it would change. But there is really no need.

i dont have time, i would be writing for over an hour and i dont owe him anything. 
The information is out there, that was my point.  dont personally attack me because i have better things to do and still wanted to give a small lead.  
btw that was a super lame one liner even for reddit standards. jesus. If you are that upset i didnt elaborate may i jsut ask why you even care about a strangers opinion? if you struggle to get the bigger picture too just DYOR, its the only way you will ever understand blockchain and the ecosystems governing it, not from one reddit person explaining
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:50:49
the technology behind bitcin really isn't that difficutl to understand unless you are computer literate. but i guess most people are.  
that said they do not need to understand that to make use of it. and it can be explained in basic form without having to tell them how the tech works
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:01:47
im not interested in deconstructing the intimate details of all of this. its 4AM and you are a reddit stranger.  
you can have ur opinion, its fine. me having an opposite one really shouldn't upset you or make you question your own in such a way.  
But this is a bigger picture thing, the direction society is going in technology, financially, the past trends and economics and their similarities and parallels, along with the very technology of blockchain itself, and crypto currencies independently of them. its very big, and this is infancy. it might be unrecognizable soon, like internet in 1985. you need to see the bigger picture and try to link it together, and then you see potential, as i said. potential.    
your life as you know it today, will seem prehistoric in 20 years from now. realise this. in terms of money(as a small mundane part of the massively different world you will live in), cash is not even likely to exist
like i said, no time or energy to spend hours debating and explaining all of these with reddit strangers. DYOR and thinking.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:54:27
you need to learn more about economics, the history of money, how loans and debts work globally, and then learn how blockchain works more intimately and what exactly BTC has behind it that no other cryptos do despite its ancient tech by todays standards.
once you know it becoems cleary why it could reach such value.
@_date: 2018-04-22 09:05:56
Lol this is the problem with reddit and why its a shitty site.  Tou have a different opinion and people either attack you or censor it with down votes. Im not even invalidating anyone with my posts at all, im not gate keeping what so ever.
If you are virwing me this way its because you think i have some knowledge you want and might value but i cba to open I dialogue so hes baiting it out of me
In an immature way.
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:53:59
Im bad at simplifying information lol, it would be long winded and hard to follow. Google is full of good resources 
@_date: 2018-04-22 08:52:24
You cant handle someone who has a different opinion to yourself. I think the only child here is you.
I worked in app design and building for a long time and now am shifting towards blockchain solutions as a layer to traditional problems because of how revolutionary it is. 
Like i said, this is my job, and ive seem how tech has moved and understand how blockchain or similar technology is going to be a base level of society in years to come
Without the average person even knowing they use it.  Im not going to explain intimate details because it would take fucking hours and unless you are an OS or App developer would probably be a waste of time.
Once again you are free to have your own opinion. Why are you attacking me because mine is different? Thats really childish or maybe shows you want me to change your mind but arent mature enough to ask me relevent questions.

what makes you think so?
So far from my research it is not really that worthwhile, especially as a UK based trader.
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:14:05
you must understand that it is very confusing for a newbie lol.
Even one that understands how cryptography works.
Right now my issue is digesting all the information so i can create my own cold storage options, addresses and hotwallets.
For now i wanted to buy some just so i can own them while i figure it out. coinbase was mentioned on the guide i was reading as an example, like blockchain.info.
however it appears coinbase sucks for UK customers...

This isn't a problem though...
Mining is just ONE way that a blockchain ledger can work.
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:12:10
LTC does all of that and supports all the features BTC hopes to use in second layer solutions. in simple terms LTC always has an advantage being so similar in infrastructure to BTC. Its newer generation and more advanced. And it handles similar numbers of transactions without any crippling at its peak volume.  
Stop defending it!

people are not using BTC for trading pairs as much now. there is a huge shift towards ETH. Its probably why it went past 1k usd. The long bank holiday stopped people getting fiat into crypto market to buy alts. when a surge came in, everyone was buying ETH from exchanges with fiat to transfer to other exchanges and trade alts with.
When i want to buy alts with fiat, BTC isnt even an idea anymore. I buy ETH from GDAX with my fiat and then get alts.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:35:05
simply more profits in alts. dont delude yourself.

@_date: 2018-01-04 15:26:31
So you're entire investment method is to rely on the idea that uninformed people might buy it?
hope you are at least somewhat diversified.
TRX released an actually working product yesterday. so its doing well now. not many crypto can say that. It also has good potential.
BTC is not looking optimistic atm with third generation blockchains coming. The only hope it does have is the brand name and  "dumb money".

@_date: 2017-12-28 01:33:15
you miss the point. a daily 5% change in something that is 300 dollars equals to around + or - 15 dollars.
When its 20,000, that becomes 1000 dollars.
Nobody providing services wants that bulllshit. and its evident in how so many places that used to accept it dont anymore all for the same reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:29:46
Uk exchanges already require this due to current banking related laws. Without uploading a debit card, id form and such you cannot use the services.
This is also why buying in gbp is super awkward.

yes, but what difference does it make? they Sotashi doesn't hold any magical keys to stop btc or make it greater. He just provided the first working model and then the decentralized public ledger lives on. he has nothing to do with it at all.

TRX could be a good long term prospect. but generally anything that dickhead Mcafee pumps should be avoided, he seeks out a few shitcoins and dumps straight after. A few people made a nice profit riding the wave. but its all too obvious now and mcafee is catching heat for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:52:08
this is so predictable now i have no idea why everyone doesn't sell their btc for another stable cryptocurrency or one that is on a slight rise and then swap back at the bottom of the dip.

same. I was planning on selling tonight predicting it would get to about 13.5k and then crash down again tomorrow to about 12.6k where i'd by back in.... Which would be fairly consistent with recent trends and past performance when milestones are reached (tonight was 10kgbp)...
but this shit is mental. Like unmatched lol... it's up 2k GBP in one day and it's all ATH. I'm not brave enough to predict an imediate dip tomorrow anymore.  
It could go crazy high from here, but who knows what wall street are up to. all i know is that a lot of investors are buying up early now before futures, without a doubt.

what is so hard to understand about people cashing out at 10,000? its nothing to do with weak hands. many people in for a long time just decided that 10,000 was their eventual cash out.
in USD, the volume is way more than 10x higher. that means the market is larger too. When it hit 10,000 usd, it rose to 11 in 15 minutes. FOMO drove it up like mad.
Only then people cashed out, after seeing it was still rising. when 200,000 orders are set to sell at once it takes a LONG time to fill them so the market will dip.  
same happened with EURO except the volume is lower so immediately it happened, and the orders were filled a lot faster.  
This happens like a clock work a miles stones... people should understand what is happening by now. in the future when wales cash out at like 50k expect it to drop down to like 30k potentially.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:06:17

Every significant crypto is down. Money is leaving the market along with BTC. 
This either shows how much they all depend on BTC (and how trying to trigger a death spiral in it like the BCH shills want is retarded as it only serves to harm them too) or it shows that the entire market was bubble, not just btc.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:33:16
yeah ive noticed this. someone (dont know if its wallstreet or not) is testing how they can manipulate the market. 
It seems they are just seeing how it reacts atm. Once they determine their power, it's probably gonna spell some real bad things tbh. Its very easy to manipulate it as of now.

You're acting like it only increases in value. Vendors and service providers don't want to accept a payment that will be worth 20% less tomorrow.
I'll share my thoughts on what this sub thinks about spending btc.  
Everyone here is starting to realising that BTC is facing its biggest crisis ever. they are pulling heads out of the sand. We have good solutions  the way thankfully but not for a while.  Everyone here is concerned with the fiat value of BTC, or perhaps a few with what they can exchange with BTC in the future. how wealthy it can make them whether they use fiat or not. 
People seek any argument possible to support this notion.
"people will accept it as payment more, and it will fuel its adoption and value increase" is usually said, or words to the effect of. Its wishful thinking. I know A LOT of vendors who operate online that no longer accept BTC. they used to for a while. They all tell me that it's WAY too volatile, and the normal 1-5% range was fine with them but when it reaches such a high price, those 1-5% is too much now, let alone the big dips and increases we see lately that far exceed 5%. They dont want to be paid with something worth less tomorrow, and customers don't want to spend it either. nobody wins here. 
This problem wont go away if "vendors increase adoption". it will make it worse. So its a fallacy to assume that vendors will accept it more and customers will spend it more, further increasing adoption. if that happened, the value would only get more volatile. 
It basically boils down to the fact that everyone in this sub now and the majority of holders are only concerned with it rising in value and wealth.  using it as a currency which is decentralized comes second. This is the next biggest threat to BTC after the current scaling issues. 
Best case scenario, is that BTC does become digital gold, and another coin will be used for payments. but, then when we look at the alt market, its all so very linked to BTC that its going to be very hard to remove the volatility that BTC bleeds into everything else. If that does happen, BTC may lose value to something better. hopefully we all get the heads up. Diversify your portfolios. 
So much has happened since September, that it is definitely not business as usual with BTC payments anymore. We will see the effects of this soon enough.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:41:06

Its a good reason to sell. When stupid money starts investing in things with more than they can afford(bad financial skills), its when a bubble really starts and catastrophic crashes become a reality.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:25:30
You will have to do it NOW. Roger  and Jihan have already reduced mining hash on BCH for the last hour so nothings confirming properly. They are desperately trying to avoid this inevitable crash. probably doing some back end things to avoid losing money with their coinbase cronies . Just proves how centralized the mining is for BHC.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:14:35
if it goes up by 2k a week for an entire year, it's the definition of a bubble.  
people will have no reason not to invest into it. everyone and their grandmother will. This will cause it to get more expensive. It will have to pop eventually. whether thats 50k, 100kg, or 1million is anyones guess
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:58:58
As on, people say they are hodlers, but they change their mind when it starts to look like they will lose money. some people have weaker hands than others. never underestimate market psychology. Greed can get the best of a lot of people too.
They aim to shake those weaker hands free of their coins. Stagnation of price for a month or a decline can do just that. then when whoever is in control has bought out hundreds of thousands to millions of btc, they pump the price all the way to the moon.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:50:16
Its becoming a feature to be clogged up.  
I'm just getting malefic visions of a perfect storm.  
Mempool clogged as hell.  
some forked version of btc gets a good pump and is 20%+ more profitible to mine.  
Lots of hashrate suddenly moves to a forked coin.  
Mempool is even more clogged up.  
An exchange goes down due to tether being unable to pay people out.  
People cant even get their btc on an exchange to cash out before the price tanks even more due to clogged   mempool, with a difficulty adjustment still a few days away.    
Lightning network needs to get here asap. But even then, will lightning network handle bigger transactions? It doesnt seem looking at the blockchain that most transactions are negligible amounts, most are medium to large sized transactions. I hope LN handles them appropriately or nothings going to change till we get forced intoo sme hard fork,
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:14:35
Yes, but the climate is different.
Its hard to say if it jus got sudden momentum or bubble. I really think bubbles are more caused by money entering which cannot stay. Money being spent which doesn’t belong. Ie stupid money.
We’ll see. Im not optimistic about the moon by dec 2018. We have a new hurdle.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:21:28
all transactions are public. its how blockcain works. reusing an address makes you less anonymous. its bad etiquette for the person you are trading with as well as yourself.  
So if two transactions are made on the same adress its easier to determine who it belongs to.  
with 20 dollars worth i dont think you need to worry. there would be higher priority "targets". also, some of the richest wallets in the world have "topped up" and the are still fine. but its just good practice anyway.

its extremely difficult to trade btc in sterling. Even for people living in the UK.
The easiest way will be to cash out in EUR and then exchange it to GBP. no exchanges reliably or easily allow deposits to UK banks in GBP. The only option is to send in EUR and lose a fee fro mthe bank, or exchange it yourself and then send it to the bank after as GBP. 
Most UK residents use an app called "revolut" which allows free market rate exchanges up to 5k gbp a month and then a fee of 1% is taken.  It acts like a current account. send EUR from an exchange to the app, exchange to GBP then bank transfer it from the app to their bank account (any highstreet bank will be fine).
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:04:10

trading is more profitable  that holding in crypto market because its very volatile, and is not regulated, and its not mature. 
You just have to know which waves to ride, and what is shit and what is shit but profitable due to obvious pumps.  obvious pump and dumps like mcafee announcing coins should be steered away form unless you know you can sell it off again before it reaches its peak. (reads: within 10 seconds of the tweets)

Wish people would realize that LN wont solve much. Look at blockchain, most transactions are medium to large sized. It wont clear them mempool much now let alone in 1 year with more adoption. 
The trouble is not enough people are looking into the tech and greed is getting the better of adopters and even providers of services.  
Segwit is a GREAT start and buys us time. But in the future, a hard fork is necessary.

bury your head in the sand. Why don't you go actually learn how BTC, blockchain, mining works. and while your at it go look into the details fo what Lightning network is and you might realise why it's not going to solve the underlying problem.
Hurts too much to have your get rich easy dreams popped. 
Now if the community and service providers were not so greedy it could be fixed faster but that is a pipe dream too. 
Since march, this sub has changed a lot. no criticism allowed. I think a flood of speculators looking to get rich has joined, and it just became a lot of people with no clue how the tech works. that is why nobody wants to listen.

the blockchain or equivalent in an alt has to "confirm" or "verify" that the transaction happened.  I used it in context of blockchain rather than trading specifically.

If i were all of you i would be using shapeshift or Changelly to get some alt which confims reasonable fast with your BCH from  coinbase. That is if you want to make something out of it.  
Second trading goes live it will plummet and almost none of the sell orders are going to fill at current value.
however mass dumping together will also help to kill bhc beyond recovery so its quite noble. A step further would be everyone dumping it for $1 dollar. Total annihilation.

its easy.
find a coin that is undervalued. Look at market cap. only 300 million?  if it got to only 1 billion cap that is triple your money. this is happening to many coins daily right now. some are pump and dumps though. but its easy to tell when a shitcoin wich is not undervalued suddenly gets overvalued.
BTC getting to 45K USD from here is a HUGE wall. some small undervalued coin going from 10 cents to 1 dollar isn't at all.

except LN doesnt fix this. It only reduces it. by a small fraction. LN aims to handle "coffee" amounts of btc transactions. most transactions now are in the thousands. The best LN can do is reduce that 200k to 150k.

Doesn't take a genius to replace my literal example of "wrench"  and abstract it with any other possible means of forcing something out of you violence or non violence. Even some kind of social snakery. THAT was the point of this post. didn't realise so many people were this literal.  
Also, isnt the first line of defence and the main thing Americans say about guns is that they are a last resort? only to defend? the best line of defence is to prevent the situation ever occurring, so what is wrong with simply not telling people how much BTC you have, lest you are looking to invite opportunity to show someone you have a gun.

Same could be said about Bitcoin in comparison to many alt coins right now though. doesn't always mean the markets reflect it. 
However LTC does everything better, and scales better even without off chain second layer solutions. LTC can have Lightning network the same day BTC gets it, which would only make LTC better still.

Its going to kill it. The community is too blinded by the dollar symbols. Very sad. I was excited by btc for a long time but now i dont even want to tell people to buy it when asked. I regret getting my family into it. I'm not confident in it begin worth much for much longer. Let alone going to the moon. We've reached the height of its peak now if nothing changes. By the time LN comes around it will be too late, and even when LN arrives a bigger block size will STILL be necessary in the future no matter what...

yes but thats the long game for them. they obviously want to buy as many as possible while its low. If they can shake out the mass of weak hands buy being able to manipulate the market for a few months, they can force them to sell of their coins at around the current value. Then once they obtain million+btc they can start pumping it up like crazy..  
Basically, they want to accumulate a lot at this price without the price going up due to them buying. shake out the weak hands. then take it to the moon.

They tried to trigger what they call a death spiral. It needs a clogged mempool, a difficulty increase and a big pump from an alt like bcash, finalized with a dramatic flash crash on btc.
They also need miners to swap to bcash and gain 50% of the hash but doesnt seem to have worked.
They played every card they had last night and failed.  Coinbase let it happen at 5pm hoping most people would be active and available to react to market and panic. Roger even sacrificed a big portion of his btc at a loss to pump it(all those trades like 3btc for 1 bhc, and usd8500 offers).It may not be over yet as he might still pump dead money into it. I think coinbase saw the huggee sell walls of bhc and shit the bed so they froze trading to evaluate their next move.
If they are in deep enough they probably wont allow selling of bcash at 8am to delay the crash on it. But people will just dump on other exchanges so they delay the inevitable

risk? in crypto? this is the wild west right now. there is SO much money to be made with even a little bit of know how.  Pick a decent under valued coin and double your money. even 20x it. find something that is just started to rally and get off it before it peaks and corrects. 
as long as you stay away form obvious pump and dumps like mcafee its fine. Start with a low amount so you get the gist of it. 
I really wish i did this months ago.  it say the risk to reward is heavily skewered to reward. Risk goes up the mroe day trading you do however. If you play the mid term game its the best. 
Most people could turn 1bt into 2 btc extremely easy if they wanted.

Revolut is subject to the same laws and scrutiny as banks in the UK at least. it has insurance too. wtf are you talking about? they just wont close your account for dealing with btc or block transactions as they benefit from it.
Banks(here in the UK) have been closing down accounts of people who purchase from conbaise or cash-out from btc often. If you mention crypto in references it will flag you. 
maybe other countries have more btc friendly banks and governments, but here at least its not smart to use your bank account for constant btc transactions directly.

i'm with you. It's such an obvious money grab by that dickhead and his scum comrades. However, In our current dire situation, it is undeniably solution. One that will run into the same and then even WORSE problems in the long term(which will be harder if not impossible to fix imo), but it works now none the less.  
That said, with all the uncertainty atm, If coinbase did support it and somehow the mighty dump of 01.01.18 doesn't make it tank completely, people might get on board with it. having it on such a powerful front end service does wonders for it.

Because technically Both do the exact same thing, but the new one is improved objectively. 
A lot of people question if the improvement is really necessary and some believe its giving room for abuse by miners. its quite complicated. 
all you need to know as a buyer or holder is that whatever one PEOPLE like yourself decide is best will continue and the other will likely die out. The value will probably completely swap over to the newer coin eventually but i cant say that for sure. 
all you need to know is that the winner will be clear and you will just be trading and storing that version instead after the dust settles like nothing happened.

This dip was predictable. It hovers at 9.8k for days with resistence and as soon as it crosses the 10k line it goes mental to 11k due to the mass fear of missing out by the weak hands. Then it continues to rise a bit before dipping back down to around 10.5k where it should be once people come to their senses.
I made quite a nice little bit of pocket change from this.
All you had to do was view a few exchanges to see a HUGE shear rise in buy orders at exactly 10k... was predictable.

SEPA to coinbase with some EUR from your UK based bank account once you have linked it. Just dont forge the unique reference or it bounces after a week.  you can use debit card too but fee is ridiculous. 
I believe Barclays have free Swift transfers with the app or online banking atm.
Once the funds arrive withing 3 working days, you can use your EUR wallet on coinbase to buy some. I recommend sending them over to GDAX(coinbase own it so its easy) first for lower fees but if your starting try that later.
If your bank charges you a lot for SEPA and has an ass GBP to EUR rate, you can install the Revolut app on  your phone, create an account and deposit money into it. It has its own IBAN for SEPA unique to your account. you can exchange GBP to any currency instantly at market rate for free then send it to coinbase. This is the lowest fee but it takes longer as you have to wait for it to arrive in the app, then send it to coinbase.  
word of warning about Revolut though, i have heard people say they stopped supporting SEPA to bit exchanges for new users today, because they want to set up native crypto support at the end of the month.
another app you can try if it doesnt work is FIRE.
Just remember to get Coinbase to really work your gonna need to verify your account which takes a few days with  an  initial bank deposit, passport verification and driving license verification. In the mean time you can just eat the high fees and use debit card.
If you dont want to use coinbase there are other exchanges but i think you should get a bit of experience first.
Basically its awkward to buy bits for UK citizens with GBP, but not impossible by any means jsut takes a bit longer to ge ta good deal.

loads of info out there. If you udnerstand the basics of bitcoin and how it works you will be able to make informed decisions.  
If not.. in very basic terms...
a fork is when a "bitcoin" splits into different types of bitcoin each with the same history up to the split. this is why its called forking.
Now miners and traders have to chose which one the prefer. it can leave the other one to die a slow death while it is repalced, or they can potentially coexist.
The controversy is in the split attention from the entire community which can do bad things.
thats as basic as i can make it anyone hopefully someone linkes to a good video.

Nothing i haven't done before. Nothing different. trading habits had not changed.  I don't quite understand. I made a trade last night on GDAX then this morning it was locked without reasoning or confirmation. my phone, number and and authentication app havent changed either.

i completely disagree with it being seen as "digital gold". personally i always wanted BTC to become a currency, something to spend, something to easily use worldwide. decentralized and out of banks controls. That is where the value is to me. however, it doesn't seem like its going to be viewed like that by most people, or a the very least, people have chosen it to become a digital gold instead. maybe it can be both. who knows.  
my point was that ETH is much better at being all of those things than BTC in its current form, so it may just end up being that BTC is the gold while ETH is the spend.
remember, if BTC does end up as the "storage" of value, other cryptos can be where the value in spending and use lies. crypto has evolved into an entire ecosystem now. there is no reason why BTC can't be what other cryptos will be valued against in the future, rather than USD or GBP or Renminbi

How? Bank transfer? Debit cards take money instantly.
Does your usd wallet get funds credited instantly while it actually takes weeks to come out of your bank account?

Coinbase has awful customer service. The time frame they take is alos unacceptable(weeks to months). 
Take it to legal levels and they respond faster.
I would never advise anyone to use it. It became popular because its easy to use but just because sometimes something is popular doesnt mean its good. Especially in a infant stage market like this where a service can rapidly grow beyond its means.
bitstamp is a lot better.
My advice to anyone uaing coinbase: never store any funds on it. With draw all crypto to your wallet straight away and spend any fiat as soon as you can. That goes for gdax too.
People think coinbase is great and others are juat whining til they get hit with a problem themselves, like a locked account with thousands inside, no communication and access for months.

I will try but as my account is frozen I cannot do anything like that. Just gotta wait potentially months for an email reply. 
Though I would be careful saying things like its' mostly people outside of the US. I've done research and plenty of people in US have had the same problem, many ended up taking legal action.

calling it a pyramid scheme is just a complete demonstration of not knowing anything about  it or understanding anything to do with it. its the equivalent of saying "i dont understand it and im scared of it so its not to be trusted"  
sad thing is i know some smart people even in tech sector who think about it like that still.  
the only ponzi schemes are the bitcoin support groups popping to help people invest without knowing anthing about it or ever explain it to them. big scam.

I think this is where the forking controversy comes from. Some people viewing the forks as positive and a step towards infrastructure for mas adoption. Others viewing it as a threat to their stored wealth.
Of course the exact mechanism used for individual forks are also a point of debate but in general i think the above is the main divider.  
This is why im unsure if this version of bitcoin will be the one that is used for everyday payments in years to come. maybe it will be, who knows.

I thought that, but realised that when prices rise FOMO kicks in and that can be the rest if the world.

yes, and they will drive a real crash further down worse than it needs to be once one begins. that is reality though, and it cant be stopped.
we had a real dip a few days ago back down to £4400 or so.  
first to buy at an ATH and first to sell at a real dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:54:39
yes its way too early. however, if people keeping viewing it like gold and without the end goal of spending... will we every get the infrastructure we need to spend it easily and mass adopted?  
what if a fork is the way for it to be easier? Im not saying im pro segwit2x, but what if another fork sets the foundation for mass adoption but people shun it simply because its perceived as a threat to their stored wealth? they dont view it as an eventual currency.

Sounds like you are complaining about the 2-5% daily fluctuations. Are you serious?
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:59:06
i like dollar cost averageing but for some reason i've never felt its adequate for bitcoin. bitcoin being as volatile as it has always been.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:40:00
Would you think people wanting it to be a storage forever would prohibit its growth as a currency?if the masses dont want to spend it or pay with it these systems may be very slow to build. then its real potential wont be realised as quick and it may be worth less than it could be.  Also the people using it as storage and forgetting about it may lose it all when they arent keeping track of cryto. if a new one with way better utility catches on, they may not notice till its too late because they are just storing and forgetting about it like Gold. or their lack of understanding stops them ever knowing about an altcoin rising to the top.

never understood ignoring people who arent either racist or spamming. it screams an inability to discuss things and view wider perspectives. its like you cannot handle a disagreement maturely or perspectives/opinions other than your own.

that wasn't a dip. normal fluctuation. espcailly for a Friday.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:17:59
becase they handled the last fork a bit strange. people still haven't got their Bcash.
they have been A LOT clearer on their intentions and course of action this time around so it boils down to if you trust they wont be hacked or not. doubt they will.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:35:31
Hard to say.
Correction is likely.
Also there was a MASSIVE number of people buying for the first time this weekend. People with little knowledge on bitcoin.
May have got cold feet and sold. Some
Newbies upon seeing a  value drop have had all the tiny doubt they need to panic sell. Others seen it continue down and sell too.
Its just a natural result of the  massive upward trend especially when newbies get involved.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:55:48
this is why forking is healthy for its long term future. not that every iteration of a fork is good. we will continue to see many poorly done forks like segwit2x. lets hope the eventual good one isnt shunned.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:15:39
the value in bitcoin is sending *your* money wherever the fuck you want instantly. without stupid bank fees, waiting days for it to clear, regulation, bull shit, interference, government or banking sector.
Now if you can eventually spend them without converting to fiat thats the icing on the cake.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:33:04
interesting way to view it actually. this may not be the crypto we use for daily transactions but it will be the one backing them up. kind of like the gold standard again. very interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:55:42
ETH is more useful but markets dont always work that way.
BTC may end up as storage of value, while ETH is more versatile usable.

It's an unregulated market. what groun does this lawsuit really have? Its shitty but thats what you get for investing into the wild west. you get wild west action. Lol.  
can't believe people are this stupid. No. you take a high risk investing into crypto with no consumer rights or protection. Dont cry when it doesn't work out for you.
