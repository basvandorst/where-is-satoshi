See my post [here]( on how we work. But yea if you pay with cash there's nothing we can do as there's no paper trail. Currently we only work with transactions that show up in your bank statements.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:29:31
Who do you bank with in the UK?
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:28:10
I'll have to initiate an API request later to see if your bank is supported. I'll keep you posted.
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:59:46
Depends on how detailed you want me to go, haha. Flattered that you consider it magic! We're leveraging a couple of APIs to do this:
- Intuit customer data api: let's us look at your transactions. They basically are an interface to like 20000 online banking systems. So we don't have to worry about the intricacies of individual banks.
- Blockchain.info: Let's us create a wallet for people who are entering the app with no bitcoin experience. We also use Blockchain to transfer bitcoin to users' accounts after we receive their USD, and to grab exchange rate info.
- Braintree for usd while we still have waived transaction fees
We're standing on the shoulders of giants! If you have any more questions I'd be happy to answer.
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:06:32
Cool idea! I think for now we are just going to focus on account transactions for the exact reason you stated: it would probably be difficult to push merchants to incorporate that system, at least for now.
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:45:22
Inspired by [this song]( Haha nah, but really I figured mowing the lawn = lawn clippings which are kind symbolic of the tiny change investments made. Won't lie, easy domain name was also a factor for sure.

How is the onboarding process for new users for coinbase or circle? Can I have them register for these services from within our app? Or do they need an existing account?
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:19:19
Stay tuned! We're working on our API situation. We'll be back in the harbor.
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:28:55
Unfortunately, for now, yes. We JUST launched though so don't take it as us not prioritizing those outside of the US! 
How fast we can onboard those not from the U.S. depends on what the intuit customer data api supports. If they support your bank, we just have to add it as an option when you first register your account. If they don't we need to explore other API options for getting transaction data. 
Who is your bank, if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:05:00
I am the guy! As far as acorns: definitely crossed our minds. It was obviously an inspiration for us in developing Lawnmower. However, I think their vision is different enough from ours. I don't see them wanting to mix crypto investment with traditional stock market investing -this is just speculation, but I think their whole image is the "growing tree from a planted acorn". Stability, etc. Crypto investing is of course a less stable arena. 
Then again, I do so the point you seem to be making - for someone who wants to invest in stocks and crypto in the roundups-style, it would be convenient to have just one app. 
I could envision a spin-off of their main app - like if we were under the same umbrella as them, just branded as a different app.
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:03:03
Do you let the user know that they're secretly registering for a coinbase account when they sign up for your site? Do you store the user's coinbase username and password in your database? 
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:52:17
See my comment [here]( for the word on non US bank accounts.
The fee situation is still very much up in the air. We are going to batch convert roundups to BTC definitely, because as you say converting on such small transactions is just a waste. We are pretty much in fee-parity with [acorns]( besides our bitcoin component. However, I'm sure they have other fees to worry about give that they are investing in actual stocks. And they are able to make it work.
In short, we're still working on it, but I think there's definitely a viable fee structure, and we're not going to work with one that doesn't make sense (why invest if you are getting owned by fees). For now, since intuit's APi basically forced us into a closed beta, we are just eating the cost.
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:04:27
If it's through a major US bank, then yes, that should work as well. Any account whose activity can be checked online should work.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:13:16
Intuit has paid plan for customer data api and we are in the process of upgrading. You in the SF area by any chance? I like the fire you're bringing
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:31:57
Thanks man!
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:58:48
Let's be in touch, I'll shoot you a message tomorrow
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:08:08
I do not think they should rely on it now. In the future it will be more suitable.
@_date: 2016-03-16 01:27:34
Not just yet - we're working with Coinbase as fast as we can to expand to all of the countries they support ( UK and the rest of Europe is next!
@_date: 2016-03-16 21:12:59
Nice overview + pretty inline with how I feel.
@_date: 2016-03-17 03:34:12
Just wanted to say that I really enjoy your blog. Thank you for writing. You've inspired many of my ideas.
@_date: 2016-03-15 23:21:56
Great question - first, note that we don't charge any fee on top of Coinbase's fee.
As mentioned above, we're currently expanding into portfolios of many crypto-assets. Coinbase doesn't offer anything beyond BTC.
We're an investment platform first and foremost. Right now (with the version that's publicly available), the major advantage of LM3.0 vs. recurring buys on Coinbase is our approach to analytics. Lawnmower makes it easy to see your gains / losses, track performance of buys &amp; sells, and get insights into your investment strategy. This information is not really available on Coinbase - it either requires generating reports or calculating it on your own.
Hope that clears things up! We're looking to be the crypto-investment app of the future.
@_date: 2016-03-16 00:21:06
No problem! Essentially, here's how the fees work for bitcoin buys and sells through Coinbase (when using your bank account, which is the Lawnmower default):
- for buys/sells under $15, it's a flat 15 cent fee.
- for buys/sells $15 and over, it's a 1% fee.
For more detailed fee information, see Coinbase's support articles [here]( and [here]( Hope this helps.
@_date: 2016-03-16 00:05:56
I hear you. Unfortunately the "spare change" aspect of Lawnmower was not a viable business model going forward and after long consideration we had to remove it from the platform. It wasn't an easy move to make, and we knew we'd catch some flak for it. If there is a weedeater out there, I wish them best of luck.
With the new Lawnmower we're focusing on the analytics side of the the bitcoin purchasing experience as well as working on adding additional blockchain assets to the platform with handcrafted "portfolios" that users can decide to invest in.
We know that some users will be disappointed by the change in direction but we think that the new additional features as well as things coming down the road this year will more than make up for the change. We're working on some really cool stuff here.
@_date: 2016-01-22 17:39:57
awesome idea
@_date: 2016-01-22 17:41:14
I also feel that password should be a requirement, it's a great solution
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:59:00
Is this complementary to Ethereum or attempting to replace it?
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:53:51
So how's it looking?
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:32:55
My impression is that it's not so much the (formerly low) exchange rate that makes bitcoin conducive for micro transactions; rather, it's the divisibility &amp; low transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-08-01 21:07:37
He's joking 
@_date: 2015-08-04 03:17:27

Everyone on here assuming this is an alt...can't it be the name of some asset traded on the BTC blockchain via counterparty or open assets? We don't know enough yet. Personally I think this is awesome news.
@_date: 2015-07-24 18:28:37
Did he/she present a calculation behind this figure?

Why do you feel sidechains would be better? Just curious.

@_date: 2015-09-09 00:41:39
It's quick but at the same time why REQUIRE registration? Make it optional.
@_date: 2015-04-16 04:12:54
The Coinbase API allows application developers to request specific permissions depending on what the application needs to do. In Lawnmower's case, the only permissions requested are:
- buy: so that LM can buy bitcoin for you
- user: so LM knows your email address and can communicate with you
- balance: so LM can show you your balance within the app
- transfers: so LM can check the status of buy orders it has placed
Lawnmower cannot send nor sell your bitcoin at any time.
@_date: 2015-09-12 02:54:10


Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that big exchanges do this? Usually what's meant by "off-chain" is just that balances are held in a database - similar to how existing banks work. Instead of moving money between wallets, a database just keeps tracks of balances. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:48:24
coinbae caught me slippin
@_date: 2015-09-10 08:13:01
If they are using the bitcoin blockchain it's possible that Chain takes care of abstracting away transaction fees etc...like Chain pays for them and it just ends up in the bank's monthly bill. Just a guess.
@_date: 2015-09-08 12:04:42
this is a really strange question
@_date: 2015-09-08 12:02:25
time to work on my bot...
EDIT: this could do for a better video tbh, its a solid idea
@_date: 2015-09-23 01:20:25
venmo has an absolutely gigantic userbase that are likely not eager to migrate their contacts/payment information to a new app. pretty ambitious to try and overtake them - and with not really any extra value prop for the average american venmo user (global payments being the one advantage i see, but really how often does the *average* american pay someone outside of america?). they can't win this battle with just marketing capital either: venmo/paypal are huge, have well-developed brands, and virtually limitless marketing budgets.
hoping they have an ace up their sleeve we just haven't seen yet.
@_date: 2015-09-12 07:10:26
Exactly. It needs to be between different parties for it to be impactful. At least as far as I see it.
@_date: 2015-09-12 06:12:35
I really don't know the figures on these. What's larger at the moment: the volume at the (relatively) unknown colored coin exchanges or the volume on the (relatively) unused decentralized exchanges?
@_date: 2015-09-10 08:13:41
their landing page does say "using the open bitcoin protocol" though. why can't they just be less cryptic about the whole thing? They're really taking the whole "generic blockchain tech" thing too far
@_date: 2015-09-11 20:47:14
Why isn't there a large colored coins exchange? I like that Omni + Counterparty have decentralized exchanges built in.
@_date: 2015-09-09 02:13:12
Yea, that's useful, but still doesn't need to be mandatory.

They want their bitcoin investment to be worth a lot. I do too. However, I can totally see the utility of a private blockchain. I don't think the advent of private blockchains spells the end for bitcoin. I think both solutions can happily coexist and serve their own purposes.
@_date: 2015-11-03 12:00:16
Can't it be decentralized without being public?

When you sign up through Lawnmower we only ask for permission to a specific wallet that we create called "Lawnmower". Coinbase allows us to use their Oauth login system to specify permissions to single wallets.
This means that we can only Buy / Sell into, or out of, that single wallet. We do not take any permission to Send funds on your behalf at all, so it is impossible for us to move any of your Bitcoin once purchased.
If you would like to move your Bitcoin out of your Lawnmower wallet you can do so at any time by just doing so on your Coinbase account. That way if you do not want to keep it inside the wallet you can.
Let me know if you have any other questions about how we handle your Coinbase account or details about the implementation. At Lawnmower security is our top priority.

We were actually looking to post something on Reddit ourselves today but seems you beat us to it :)
Really appreciate the kind words! We have been pretty hard at work the past 4 months trying to get out this new update to users. We’ve heard a ton of feedback during this time and have tried to implement as much of it as possible, and we think that the end product has turned out pretty great.
This update was the first step towards building out an application that we believe is extremely needed for adoption in the Crypto space. Just as Robinhood made it easy for retail investors to get involved in the Stock Market, here at Lawnmower we are trying to ease users into this complex scene that we all know and love.
Hope you all can check out our blog post that we just pushed this morning that talks about all of this in more detail.

Any feedback or questions anyone has we would be more than happy to answer.
