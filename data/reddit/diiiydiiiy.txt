Totally inaccurate. Take your arrogance somewhere else and educate yourself. 1,000 USD is not equal to 1,000 AUD. It does not have the same purchasing power thus you wouldn't buy the same amount of BTC with 1,000 of each local currency.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:43:14
Fact is the IRS gets a cut of everything. Literally everything. And they tax the same dollar several times minimum. 
Crypto is no exception and the IRS will certainly make an example of some to get the rest to fall in line. 
It's laughable how many people still consider crypto private when in fact there's very little privacy from those with the right capabilities.
No use in hiding your buys and sells now because when you go to liquidate your BTC later on the exchanges will be required to report to the IRS and you'll have no cost basis to report from. You'll have an official notice within months and years of problems, headaches, lost sleep, penalties and more. It's not worth it.

Can you elaborate on the economy needing 0% or close to it? With sources, please. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:23:39
Please see my other comment, it should help. In short, 1,000 USD is worth more than 1,000 AUD. The number "1,000" is the same but the purchasing power is different. To compensate for that, you'll likely earn more AUD doing the same exact job at the same company than if they were to pay you in USD. The exchange rate is used to determine the difference and there's a ton of variables that influence the exchange rate.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:14:54
To be fair, by law we're supposed to report crypto trades to the IRS. So by unlucky you mean those who committed a crime?
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:15:36
This is why I've always declared and paid my crypto tax liability. I value my sleep and mental health.

People are creatures of habit, history repeats itself and market cycles are the result. 
Personally im not worried about a few of my bags that are down 50% YTD relative to btc as they're up 100%+ YTD relative to USD.
As long as you're buying up something with a strong record and that still has potential, not some shady coin that pops up with a plagiarized white paper, then you'll probably end up doing just fine.
Be cautious, critical, do your own research and don't overextend yourself to any one coin. Best of luck to us all!

Exactly. This fraud is actively trying to gain access to the real Satoshi keys I'm sure but so far hasn't been able to.
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:17:23
What you're having trouble understanding is that the price, or value, of bitcoin is theoretically the same regardless of which currency you use.
The value of your local currency is less than the US dollar which is why you need more of your local currency to buy a bitcoin as compared to the USD. One Australian dollar is worth 0.70 US dollar. This is the exchange rate. Please Google how exchange rates work to learn more.
The 1,672 AUD example equals about 1,170 USD (1672 x 0.7 = 1170) The price, or value, is the same once the exchange rate of the currency is factored. Again, you need to better understand exchange rates and why they're used. 
Pretending all else is equal, if we were paid the same 1 bitcoin then wanted to sell for local currency, then using your example 1 BTC is worth $1,170 USD or 1,672 AUD. Regardless of the number, it's the same exact purchasing power (the value of one bitcoin is the same once converted). 
Hope this helps and please ignore the hate and use that to fuel further educating yourself on exchange rates. Good luck.

@_date: 2019-02-01 12:25:03
Be careful, I think coinbase and other exchanges have rules involving betting in their tos. I seem to remember seeing posts complaining about account freezes due to gambling and such.
To answer your question I think you would have to report all winnings, not just what you cash out to fiat.

Any confirmation that game changing institutional money is actually buying or is this just the narrative we've been fed the past year? 
Has any legit source (predating bitcoin) confirmed institutional purchases? Have any large asset managers confirmed BTC holdings in their fund prospectives, etc? I'm not talking about some small funds like gbtc (3b market cap) , I'm asking about big money.

It won't fail because Facebook has marketplace, ads and other ways of incorporating crypto into a business with a billion or more users. In fact, I think Facebook crypto will be the most widely used crypto in short order due to scale. They have so many possibilities it's kind of ridiculous. FB will bridge gaps and add perceived legitimacy to crypto. 
Also, I'm no FB fan boy. In fact I hardly use my account and deleted my old account due to lack of privacy. The app is not on my phone and I log on maybe weekly. I do, however, understand how damn successful FB is at what it does which is using our data to make money.

Coinbase pro (formerly gdax) is what I use. There are so many options but look for high volume, trusted exchanges such as coinbase, Binance, etc.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:20:13
Agree about the April fools stuff being dangerous. 
Also, $100M worth of buy orders spread over 3 exchanges certainly could/did cause a massive price increase at it eats up a good chunk of the sell orders. Then short sells may need to cover thus amplifying the momentum. Simultaneously bots and fomo kick in. Fact is, $100M is a massive order current state. Don't kid yourself about such an order not moving the price even 0.01%.
Edit: take a look at the order books on Binance or Coinbase for example. Consider how much BTC is trading, the 24H volume and compare it to the roughly 7,000 btc traded per exchange in this whale order. It's quite sizeable.

While I understand your sentiment I have to say on the surface posts like this are dangerous because basically you're supporting a movement which likely leads to global financial meltdown, unemployment, poverty, crime and so on. 
Anyone that thinks crypto is ready to take the lead has a lot to learn and a short memory. How easily we all forget of the insane network fees and confirmation delays just to simply send BTC from one exchange to another. Amplify December 2017 100x to get just a taste of how unprepared crypto is to take the lead. Crypto at its peak was a drop in the bucket.
Blockchain and the associated crypto community has made major progress which needs to be commended, highlighted and supported but we're so far away from the solution that promoting a run on the banks is, in my opinion, dangerous at this point in time.
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:25:56

Price might not be a good target as crypto wealth depends on quantity x price. Perhaps a better target is when total portfolio value reaches a certain value.
The idea you're referencing is some of the world's richest elites pledging half their wealth... Pretty "easy" to do when you have several billions leftover. Not as easy when you're left with thousands (or hell, even millions).

@_date: 2019-01-14 19:20:06
No one really knows but my guess is BTC remains crypto gold for investment and speculative purposes and other coins are better used for transactions and such. For example, some coins and their related technology help settle global payments in seconds whereas BTC we have to wait for confirmations which takes anywhere from several minutes to hours in my experience. Several coins are excellent and are here to stay whereas many will die out. Good luck to all. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:50:04
Go ahead and panic sell for institutional adoption. Sounds like we're inching closer to the "despair" phase so I'm accumulating and trading. I appreciate the discounts! 
If you want to sell to realize capital loss for the IRS or because you want to buy cheaper and believe the price will decline then go ahead. Selling just to "speed up" a wishful process is uneducated and desperate.

Yeah man. I highly doubt your credit union would accept crypto for liabilities. If they do please provide a link. Crypto is a ways out from being a viable alternative for fiat and it starts with adoption. I live outside a major US city and can't say I've ever come across a business accepting crypto other than a pizza shop or similar. That's not a viable alternative, nor are wallet addresses. One day it will be much better but we're in the early stages. Too early to ignorantly support a run on the banks...

I think you're on the right track but any seed words stored electronically are vulnerable to a degree. 
You could take it next level by hiding the seed words in a file such as a report or paper you wrote for school. �� Something like using the first verb/noun/etc of each paragraph. This way even if a hacker was to gain access to your file he/she would then have to interpret said file.
Also, your password better be something legit. For example, one of my passwords is an old CD key to a software I used to install/uninstall regularly like 20 years ago. I decided to simply remember the key and it's over 15 characters long. The case sensitive collection of letters and numbers is pretty much as good as it gets and would be difficult to brute. Granted, if something happens to you then you'll need to ensure this password is accessible to someone, somewhere (safe deposit box, etc.)

Btc price action is controlled by only a few players, essentially the 1% of crypto if you will. Nothing new here. It will take years and years for whale positions to dilute and volitility would decrease in lock step. Expect more inorganic price movements and try to be on the right side of the trade. 
I'm long and think we're in the denial stage of a market cycle so I'm buying even though it's so ridiculously high compared to months ago.

If I was to use a bitcoin ATM, which I won't because of the extremely high fees, I would cancel my transaction at the first notion of requiring an ID.

Mass? Or the few whales that dictate price direction?

Lol I would love a drop to $1800!!
I bought at $4300 after the drop from $6k stabilized and then waited months thinking $1800 would come. A lot of long term TA suggested $1800 as a bottom, even if it was only a flash. As tempting as $3500 range was I sat and waited on a limit buy order that obviously never filled. Of course we all know how fast it catapulted back up and now I'm debating how much it will correct, if at all, before a resumption of a parabolic uptrend. My sights are now set on $5800 but I'm not sure we'll even see that again in this environment. 
My point is to embrace (buy) the declines as long term benefits to your portfolio rather than losing sleep and panicking on the notion of a drop in value. If you believe in the value proposition, technology and such then the price has only one direction in the big picture and that's up.
