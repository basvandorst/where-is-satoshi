I'm smart enough to understand Bitcoin, I think Bitcoin's brilliant, and by-and-large, I stay away.
But not for the reason you say.
The reasons are twofolder:  As an investment, I don't have enough money to risk losing on a high-risk investment like Bitcoin.  I know a lot of folks here are absolutely 100% convinced of Bitcoin's long-term success.  I'm not completely convinced of that, and as an investor, the success bracket is even narrower: for example, if a similar crypto currency unseats Bitcoin (in a myspace vs facebook kind of way), crypto still wins but the individual investor loses, unless they see it coming.  If I had a lot of disposable money, you bet I'd be putting some as a speculation on BTC!  
On the other hand, as a spender, the process of buying and then using BTC adds too much overhead for the relatively minimal savings.  For example, I'll pay up to 5% (or maybe more) more to buy from Amazon instead of RetailerX.com.  Why?  Because I trust Amazon, have a fully set up account, and it's very easy.  You might mention Gyft and its 3%, and that is attractive, but the risk is bank accounts have been closed occasionally for doing business with BTC businesses.  Can I risk having my bank account closed?  Not really.  Not at all!  So now I'd have to have a separate account with a separate bank to make all this work.  For 3%.  Nah.
Edit: Specifically, I don't have a "moral" objection (I think people can invest in whatever they want, regardless of risk), and I don't care about Satoshi's bitcoins. Even if he appeared and proved he had active control of them, or the opposite, it wouldn't change anything. I think the cryptocurrency system is awesome, but by definition, most people aren't "early adopters" (myself included).
