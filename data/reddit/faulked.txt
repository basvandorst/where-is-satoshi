Anyone been scammed on OpenBazaar yet? 
The stamps listing doesn't use escrow, avoid it.

Yeah, he has a necessity for a big wheel chair to move his fat ass around! And here he is inventing file-sharing software.

Bitcoin will be worth 9999,99,999 $$ after the fork
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:32:21
Ether classic became worthless. And the same will happen to the Bitcoin fork that is used the least, which may very well be Bitcoin Core with its high fees and staggering confirmation times.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:49:09
Even better, we now have Milocoin™
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:42:17
Is this hardfork really habbening?
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:48:04
Compelling argument.
@_date: 2017-03-16 08:54:28
Where to buy gold with bitcoin? Explain.

Alright, show of hands. Which one of you is defrauding the IRS? Have you no shame? Paying taxes is your CIVIC DUTY!
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:29:53
So CHYNA is Bitcoin's enemy! Glad I voted for Trump.
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:26:03
Throw all your money in the bitcoin basket, I like your thinking. Are you related to Warren Buffet by any chance?
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:56:36
Doge will replace Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-01 07:25:51
will you not grant me that open source software is more ~~secure~~ buggy than non open source?

"Nevermind, false alarm. Bitcoin is heading back to $600!"
Gentlemen. In times like these we must *hodl*
@_date: 2016-12-31 15:54:14
Bitcoin is here to stay, gentlemen. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 14:06:49
Pfffft, some freedom we have. "What? I see you have $80,000 in your account! Where did you get that money, hm???"
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:19:30
You're almost ready to break even after waiting for years. Not a bad investment. :)
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:09:29
Thank you, Hugo Chavez. :)
@_date: 2016-12-12 08:51:29
5 BTC just vanished from my wallet when I synced up. I'm not even mad. :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:24:44


The network should be designed to accommodate any and all traffic. If it can't do that, it will be replaced by something better.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:20:20
Hope those solve BTCs current scaling problems. If it doesn't, an altcoin will take the lead in fixing crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:46:31
Why would you wait? BTC could very well crash after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:08:30
Does it not worry you that any number of whales with countless 1000s of BTCs can crash the market at any second?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:23:26
Like most things, this is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:13:36
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:59:05


What makes you say Bitcoin is "real money"?
@_date: 2017-04-03 06:48:26


Well, I have seen these bitcoins casinos. Most (especially the shady ones) operate from China. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:31:29
That's not how coinbase works... 
@_date: 2017-04-03 22:29:20
Coins are in my account now. 
@_date: 2016-02-13 22:47:13
Just send an email to Satoshi and he will restore your private key. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:30:41
My freedom is worth $25,000, any takers?
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:51:30
The police can do -nothing- to help this person. What is the point?
@_date: 2017-04-01 23:05:58
There is no chance to have Justice done when an obscure internet casino steals your bitcoins, sorry. Buyer beware. If the OP wants to gamble with his BTCs he should try margin trading on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-04-02 06:58:40
Eh... I know how it works. Coinbase -tells- you the day you're going to get your coins. Except that day came and went and I still don't have my BTCs. Why shouldn't I complain?
@_date: 2016-02-01 07:00:04
if I held an assload of ethers, I'd be pumping them right now...
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:24:59
My coinbase order is also late. 'Course when I posted a thread about it I was mocked and downvoted to oblivion. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:53:58
GDAX is not coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:34:08
$100 won't even buy you a Walmart tier bike, sad
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:26:19
Did you lose any money? How much did you deposit into this casino before they disabled the account? If they simply stole your "winnings" consider yourself... LUCKY xD
@_date: 2017-04-01 23:48:43
Testnet hardforking bitcoin. Wouldn't that be ironic. :p
@_date: 2016-02-01 08:17:43
@_date: 2017-04-01 23:03:30
Coins were due yesterday, though
@_date: 2016-05-11 18:41:18
You have inspired me to Greatness, how many BTCs should I send you?
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:14:52
Who's going to double spend 6 dollars for a whopper?
