It's theft.  The timing of their shutting down with BTC going nuclear in its expansion and worth is not a coincidence.  Just because they can lean on some verbiage in the terms and conditions and gaslight everyone to their not understanding why this is an issue doesn't make it less of a theft.  It just makes it legal.  In many ways, their actions make this a worse theft.  At least the guy holding you up with a gun has the decency not to act like he has no idea why you are upset at his taking your wallet.

You are seeing the whole thing backwards, though.  The jackpot isn't gone because they sold the site.  They sold the site so they could make the jackpot money THEIR money.  
I'd be shocked if the new owners or whatever the fuck this is about DON'T have very close ties to the "previous" owners.

If Dorian isn't the creator of Bitcoin I'll eat my fucking shoe.  Did you not see the twinkle in his eye?  It shocks me... the inability of most people to read other people.  If he were a murderer being questioned by the average cop, the guy would be in huuuuge shit just by way of his body language alone.
There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that he is the real guy.

My theory:  Dorian is the email hacker AND Satoshi and this is all an attempt to throw us off.  He is right in front of us, like Keyser Soze, yet we have no idea.

Don't you condescend me, boy.  I know how to read people...  I'm sorry you do not have this power.

I will go to my grave claiming that he is actually the real guy.  My reasoning for this is purely based on the twinkle in his eye when they first publically questioned him.  There is a part of him that wants to take credit for this, but knows it can't because his entire life will be ruined.  
Call me crazy, but I have a gift for this sort of thing and although it's not 100% accurate, it's accurate enough for me to stick to my guns on this.  
I also think the bitcoin community has fostered the concept that it isn't him out of respect (EITHER WAY) and that is wonderful.  Publically, I would say "pfft, can't be him" because I know anyone who rocks the boat on a global level like this will be screwed.  But privately, on the internet, I know this dude is satoshi.  I have never seen one bit of evidence that tells me otherwise.

What's her opinion on the stock market?  Should I get out?

Yes... read your statement like a robot.  I fully believe in the sincerity of your words, robot man.
