Just a rough translation:
"Users of Mt. Gox, members of the public, and to all those present my name is Mark Karpeles the CEO of Mt. Gox...
This is the first and last suit I will ever wear in my life...
I will be leaving this world of freedom, udon noodle sets, frappes, and manga...
Soonish, I will be going back to my passion trading cards...
I am sorry, so sorry. Good luck everyone. "

I can already see a host of issues with BTC and Washington DC corruption. Lobbyists armed with BTC may just break democracy a new one.  
Cash is hard enough for the Federal Election Commission to track, how can we have them scanning the blockchain, which by the way, is anonymous.

And here in America, we say "5%". That five percent owns you most likely. Think about it.

Very true, I realize my inference is not perfect. The quote by L3 Communications president refers to what the company did, not what its employees did. For all we know Dorian Nakamoto engineered on/off switches.  
On the other hand, lots of believers will try to make a connection with the coincidence that L3 Communications works heavily with NSA-level crypto.  Just look at this job description from a LinkedIn systems engineer job:  
"Have knowledge of **cryptographic technology, algorithms, and secure protocols. This includes Suite A and Suite B encryption algorithms defined by NSA, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI)**."  
That's awful close!
