If anyone wants to loan me bitcoins I would be willing to accept your loans! I will pay -100% (won't pay u back)
Or, if u just want to donate btc to me that would be great.  I'm in some debt that I could use a hand with :)

Cause its totally normal to delete all your twitter posts and stop your website from loading without actually announcing an outage or revamp before hand.. especially with all the shit going on with your company..

Such sadness, so tired, amazed such cute doge.
Meh. Its funny. Accept it for what is is.   I mined it for a month and converted to .95 btc.   It's noob friendly and everyone tries to help anyone who asks.   A lot more open to new people and the repeated questions

if  270 000 btc are forever lost that should drive the price of btc up though you would think as the supply will be dimished a bit more.. but then again the price could fall as people freak out and sell their coins before some third party can lose them :)

I bailed on Apple to go back to a blackberry so I could, you know, use my phone to make calls.   Went to s3 for a zero and got a new blackberry z10 to test for a week.    Well it's been 10 months now and I'm on a z30.   The phone and os rock.  And u get the android 4.2.2 runtime built in.   
I know. I'm in the minority.
The only apple product is use is the ipad mini.  It's got the perfect screen size vs my nexus 7

BTC CHina's BTC price is also 863$ Canadian.. or roughly 150$ more per btc then you can get at the other exchanges so if you can transfer the yen out to a bank account and rebuy from another exchange you would be set.. But Fiat goign to exchanges seems to take along time.
mt gox had the most traffic previously as the price was normally higher because of withdrawing issues.

No worries. Bitcoin is using the stair master now to get a jump on New Years resolutions!
