I recommend the Cancer Research Group at University of New South Wales:
They have made a game changing breakthrough for creating new generation cancer cures and will keep on making quantum leaps.
They are a small lab, so one bitcoin will make a significant difference. Not sure if they are set up to accept bitcoin though

BCH adoption is not a threat to bitcoin
It is the resources bitcoin founders are using to attack BTC that is a threat to all coins.
Promote BCH but stop slandering BTC because the mud you are slinging is hurting all coins including your own one

BCH is not trying to be collaborative and win - win like LTC
BCH is being competitive and trying to win by chopping others down
Well divided we fall- including BCH

You are not reading my comments
I quite clearly stated it is not about adoption or positive campaigns to promote BCH.
It is about how BCH is promoting itself by a vicious attack on Bitcoin that is hurting all coins including BCH
Think about the wise mottos
Divided we fall and united we stand
Do not kill the goose that laid the golden egg

BTC crowd don’t boycott LTC or any other alt coin. They have reacted reasonably to being aggressively attacked by BCH

Bitcoin is not a take over the world get rich quick scheme.  It was designed to stop power trippers from taking over the world by decentralising money. There have been bad people jump on the band wagon but the core is still good.
I take your point about the mining process though. That should be fixed

Your rant would be very interesting if you included evidence/examples so the reader could decide if they should believe you or not

By the way
What does your user name mean
Are you cheering the BTC crash even though it is pulling your BCH down with it. You need to understand that if BTC falls so go all cryptos

If you want to boycott bitcoin then do it
But BCH founders needed to stop slandering Bitcoin. Nobody wins a war. You have created an ill wind
