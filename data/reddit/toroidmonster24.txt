You chose the worst possible fee of 7%. There are plenty of prepaid cards another user described that has lower fees.

true. it's easy for me to run a live CD if needed, but a bit more difficult for me to get a separate printer. Plus, the reason I ask is because work printers are nice and there's some high quality paper at work. If I was to print this thing, it should be a high quality master copy

I suppose that's doable. My work laptop more likely has keyloggers than my home computer.

I think the issue is security right now. It's not hard to send money and receive money, but it's an issue for security. I guess Blockchain is decently easy to use though.

Password? Pretty good, but your vulnerability in releasing something encrypted is the exact same vulnerability for all your other accounts. Bitaddress.org generages public and private keys with BIP38 encryption for the private key, so yes, it is ready to print.
I'm not advocating to show off my encrypted private key to the world, but at the same time it shouldn't be an issue if its encrypted. But at the same time do we really need to jump through hoops to buy an offline netbook, buy a 1 time use printer, set it on fire, etc? Maybe a bit overboard don't you think?

I'm using 5 years as a very conservative figure. It will last just fine for many years, but people on are in some fantasy-land where they think BTC is the only reality and that if you don't accept bitcoins, you're behind the times. I mean seriously, how many people are not buying on Amazon right now because they don't accept BTC. I think the bigger issue is that they don't serve every country in the world currently rather than accepting Bitcoins.

Publishing an encrypted key is not the same a shouting out your password....

I just find it hard for the average Joe to have a whole spare computer lying around. Even for me its difficult because I don't have one that's not connected to the internet.

And if you have your tinfoil hat on you can save the Bitaddress page so you can run it offline or on another computer.

Okay, computer is out of the question, but I happen to have an extra Android phone. It's easy to install CyanogenMod on a Nexus S and install Electrum.
Is the Android electrum client just as capable of generating a 12 word seed wallet like I would be able to on a computer?

How insecure is Blockchain? They claim to have no storage of your passphrase, so isn't that pretty solid? Essentially you're relying on them only for storage of the wallet. You can still keep an offline copy yourself.
The reason I ask is because with cold wallets, how many freak out incidents do you have with users here? People misplacing encrypted wallets or using old computers that could potentially croak any moment? What about paper wallets and misplacement? These are genuine concerns.

Right, that's something totally different... a deterministic wallet. What I'm saying is a Bitaddress random seed that encrypts the private key with BIP38. It's not that I want to flash it to the whole world, just that I don't have to go total tinfoil on it.
I guess the equivalent would be if you encrypted the 12 words in a strong format with scrypt. It wouldn't be the end of the world if you accidentally left a post-it on your desk with the encrypted version. It **would be terrible though** if you left the unencrypted version lying around for the public.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:40:20
But isn't the private key in its encrypted form still locked? That's like saying we can't store an encrypted private key.

You're getting downvoted because this is where everyone thinks the USD is doomed and ANY other payment system like Paypal will die. The reality is that probably in the next 5 years, fiat will do just fine, even if Bitcoin continues to grow.
