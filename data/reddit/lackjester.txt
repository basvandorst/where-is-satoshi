Try restarting Electrum or - if that doesn't work - connecting to a different server manually.

I'm seeing [75 confirmations and an adequate fee of 0.0001152 BTC]( so the problem lies in your Electrum wallet not displaying the transaction correctly.

That's usually because people can chargeback payments. You won't need to provide ID for cash/in-person transactions. 
Besides, even if your identity is known, you can still mix your coins and whatnot. Anonymity isn't 'the point' in any case.

I've never used Helix, but I assume it takes time to tumble your coins. Their wiki lists a wait time of 30 mins to 2 hrs after 3 confirmations.

More blockspace means lower/no fees which means more room for inefficient/spam transactions. Blockchain data can't be erased, so it shouldn't be filled with useless data. Also, setting up a large 'harddrive' requires centralization. 
A blocksize increase is the worst-case scenario for scaling, because it's just a shifting of its properties/resources. (i.e. it doesn't improve the network, it just increases usability by sacrificing some of its value and trustlessness.

Wish I would've had that much money to work with when I got into crypto. It sucks being young and poor. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:24:19
From what I've gathered, unlike a blocksize increase, LN adds complexity to the system and allows for the emergence of new properties, and it's fully modular/opt-in. 
I'm not sure what the downsides to this are, but expert consensus tilts that way so I'll just tag along.

I'd be more likely to kick that can down the road if it wasn't for the fact that doing so: requires a hardfork, centralizes nodes through increased bandwidth usage, doesn't get rid of ASICBoost and transaction malleability, doesn't open the door to a plethora of more advanced technologies, and isn't even necessary in the first place.

Day trading incurs fees, requires time and effort, is generally perceived as stressful, and opens one up to the value depreciation of fiat. It should be done with moderation unless one enjoys it or has some significant edge over others. 
It's a form of gambling.

There's Localbitcoins also. Many sellers accept bank transfers, in-person cash exchanges, PayPal, etc...
You can also mine altcoins and convert them into Bitcoin. That doesn't require KYC.

1) It'd cost a lot more to purchase 10 million GPUs, especially since they'll require harddrives, RAM, motherboard, etc... 
2) The average person owns at least one PC/GPU and can't afford ASICs. There's already a wide distribution of computing power.
3) Energy is cheap (&lt;0.06 per Kw/h) in Canada. 
It may not be a permanent solution, but it'd be a massive improvement nonetheless.

Just a small correction. I'm not even kidding. It went from 2700 to 1800 what like a month ago? It then recovered quickly and even set a new all-time high. Welcome to Bitcoin.
People are understandably antsy and tend to overreact to meaningless news. The fundamentals haven't changed. Things may get rough but miners and/or devs will eventually realize they're shitting on the value of their coins/investments and adapt accordingly. 
Sell if you want or need to. There's a lot of money to be made shorting the market with all this FUD. Just don't forget to rebuy when the time comes or you'll be left out for good.

Localbitcoins.com, but most sellers don't accept PayPal or credit cards since those can be charged back.
