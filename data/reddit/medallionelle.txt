- Are you saying Ethereum has no merit? All the EEA members are fools to even endorse its usability as the DLT with the potential of trust-less smart contracts? You are not even giving things time to evolve and go through its growing pains. You are the person who would reject Google at its initiation, when 17 established companies rejected it. The ICO space is crazy in its valuation, admitted. But why did the ICO space actually kick-off in Ethereum only? Aren't other Blockchain protocols attractive? The fact that the ICO mechanism is thriving on this network shows that it leads innovation in that space. Note that I said the "ICO Mechanism" not the "ICO hype". Will disasters happen? Yes. DAO happened. But do they have the grit to go forward and solve the problems as they come? They solved the DAO. Was everyone happy? No, a fork exists for a reason. The fact that this platform is taking risks and having features already that others don't makes it more valuable now and for speculation. If you respect Vlad Zamfir as a responsible developer, you think he is an oxymoron to waste his time as an Ethereum Core developer? And not a Bitcoin or SiaCoin developer? 
- Let's not be stupid, the EEA members have to experiment with their private chain fork of Ethereum first before they interact with the public chain. And any interaction on the public chain will cost ETH. That's what people are speculatively investing for in regards to EEA. You don't expect these Corporations to go headlong immediately into using the public Blockchain, you want them to experiment on their own first. And if Ethereum is the protocol being widely tested by the corporations in contrast to other Blockchain protocols, then it will obviously garner more speculative interest.
- Have the grit to help something grow through its pains to reach its potential. You like Siacoin because it's simple, effective and works. Ethereum is exponentially more ambitious and its leading the innovation in this space. Prism of ShapeShift is being built on this network and not on anything else for a reason. Storj transported themselves to this network instead of Counterparty for a reason. Vladimir Putin meets Vitalik for a reason. A reason that they cannot find in other Blockchain protocols. So please sell your ETH soon, and in fact sell anything that dares to be ambitious and takes failure head on.
