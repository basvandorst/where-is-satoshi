Same, I’ve stopped recommending cryptocurrency to my friends. Slowly pulling out some profit and starting to keep more on an exchange for easy escape. Bitcoin has only gotten less viable and this rise is super strange, no real consolidation. 
 I can’t wait for the crash so it can go back to normal. 
Does anyone remember Fidget spinners? There’s a guy who was selling off pallets of the things for a small % of what he paid to get them made.

I’m not invested in btc but another cryptocurrency that I’m not going to shill. I cashed out my initial deposit after it 10x and now I’m sweet. It can crash any time but it will be no real loss to me. Think of the rest of it as play money.

Your Australian too. July 1st Australia acknowledged bitcoin as a currency removing capital gains taxt. Both parties are all over it. If transactions are made with bitcoin they can still tax it the same as aud. 
China gov are backing NEO.
Japan's doing the same thing.
Russia, India and other are relaxing laws.
Governments are starting to understand that they need to get on board or be left in the past.

Goldman Sachs will have the most to gain by shorting bitcoin. 
The fact that they're right about price predictions is a self fulfilling prophecy. 
Some traders may be right in following them and make some money but they know little more then us, the only edge they have is to influence the market and their goal is to sell high, create fud, buy low, create fomo, take profit high, rinse and repeat. 
Last week it was fomo, now comes the fud.

My boss has been pretty into investing in stocks and pulling out before he could make any profit. 
I told him to look into bitcoin and crypto currencies. Told him as much as he would listen and told him how to get involved. 
I asked him if he'd looked into it, he said he had read a few articles. He then pulled out a pen and drew a big triangle circled two spots and said you bought in here and expect me to buy in here. Seriously fuck that normie.

1st rule of bitcoin, only buy what you're willing to lose, 2nd rule, never sell for a loss. If it drops lower than you bought it, put it away, pretend it's worth zero and forget about it. Yes bitcoins made many people rich but it's also lost a lot of people a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:48:19
If you're worried about losing money now there's no way you would have invested then when it's risk was ridiculous and a fraction or people believed it would ever get to this point. Yeah there is a risk of it dropping and sitting at &lt;1000 for another year. But that's up to each person to manage their own risk vs reward. 
You can still be an early investor in a lot of other cool technologies, but again, high risk. No ones going to get rich without putting it on the line.

I like the way you think. I'm not completely convinced that this will be the lowest price well see. However I bought in the last of my trading fiat at about 4K.

I'm getting so tired, it's been a big quarter. I wish I didn't try to play stockbroker and just held. I've gained 1 additional bitcoin during this period but I can honestly say it hasn't been worth it. Even when I've pulled out and the market dropped and a managed to buy back lower. It would have been less stressful to get a second job and invested everything from that and just held.

I like you guys and your innovation, I can put up with it being slow sometimes and I know you're working on it. 
However I'm kind of forced to use 3 different exchanges to trade altcoins I want in my portfolio, not obscure ones, just top 20s. I know you were the first to trade etherium and it's a feather in your cap but it's slowed since then.
I hate trading between exchanges, fees are eating my stash and it feels less secure. 
I don't understand the work to add trading pairs but I have considered dropping kraken as it doesn't offer anything that I want and others can't offer.
What coins do you have in the works? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:44:26
No worries mate, if I was a trader I'd buy back soon though.

Yup, at least consider buying one, I'll live on the street before I let my wallet drop below 1btc. I'm sure there's a lot of people with the same mentality.
There's only ~16m coins mined, by the time 21m coins are out the population will maybe be &gt;10b.
1m is locked away forever and up to 4m is lost forever. It will become more scarce as people pass away without passing their keys on and as people lose hardware and paper wallets or send them into the abyss.

True I don't get that. I bought 5, sold and bought again when that money could buy 7. Sold again, hopefully I can get 8. I was fairly confident of the swings but if I'm wrong I knew the risks.
At the end of it all having more of something you believe in is better than having less.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:51:02

2000 if we're lucky
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:08:09
I'll try. 
Think of the bitcoin block chain as an account book. One that keeps track or everyone's money as an example I'll say a small town off 100 people. 
As bob purchase groceries from bill for $50 at the store they would go to this account book and both sign the transaction saying bob to bill $50. 
Now an accountant comes to town and says that he wants to change the account book to a new (maybe better) one. So he will take all transactions from the old book and write them on the new one, now there are two account books with the same history. If everyone in town agrees to use the new account book then the old one will disappear and nothing will happen to anyone's money (softfork). 
If 70 people want to use the new book and 30 people want to use the old one and both groups start recording transactions on different books then both account books will have to stay (hardfork). 
Now transactions recorded in this town are either going to be on the new book of the old one, each one not recorded on the other. 
Bob and bill will have to decide what account book they want to record their transactions on. The old book on has 30 people using it and the new one has 70 so the new one has more worth than the old.
Bob can buy  his groceries from bill on one account book, he pays $50, they both go and sign the NEW account book. Then bob can go spend that $50 again with Julie at her flower shop and they both go sign the OLD account book.
So basically, after a hardfork, you will have coins on both block chains. The same amount of coins on each at the time of the split. 
Leave them for a few days to make sure you aren't accidentally spending on both chains.
Now that you have coins on each chain you can spend them independently of each other. 
One chain may become useless as people stop using it.

No he's saying that btc will lose some value as you can't just create value. If bcc is worth anything at all btc value will have to drop to accommodate that. 
It won't be half though, I imagine 95/5 or 90/10 at most to start.

I like to see the future of bitcoin as an unregulated bank; a store of wealth. Is secure, sometimes slow, and fees won't be viable if you want to buy a coffee. Other altcoins are better for fast, cheap transactions, or executing contracts.
Moving botcoins to litecoin will be like taking cash out of an ATM.

I don't prefer bcc, in fact, very little people do. I don't know everything about it but it seems like people think that it it keeps in line with the ideals of the bitcoin vision.  I think bcc (the new coin)  will be worth very little. 
Btc will always have value, even as just a store of value. It's actually becoming more useful. After November it will have more utility then ever before making a lot of alt coins obsolete.
These are my views but no one truly knows what will happen.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:17:27
Could be. May not be.
What do you think will affect this price drop further?
What will be the end of it and initiate a recovery?
At what price will you buy back in?
If it raised to 3000 again tomorrow will you fomo buy and take a loss or wait it out?

Really it's not a huge deal, it's like giving your cousin $3000 and trusting that he will give it back when you ask. You trust him, it'll ruin his reputation if he doesn't give it back, he's using it for his own purpose now but when you ask you can get it. Unless he's sick, or bankrupt, or the currency suddenly splits in to two and he gives you back only one portion of the 3k.
Ya know what, YouTube will teach you more than us. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:53:30
I don't get why everyone's so excited for "free coins"
You can't create value from nothing. If free coins are worth anything they are borrowing that value from something else. 
That something else is bitcoin, I speculate a drop in the price of bitcoin. In fact I'm betting on it.
Edit: I also don't think it will stay down. Just a dip in price. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:10:08
Thank you
Yeah some members are elitists. Think that if you can't find information yourself you don't deserve to know. 
The fact is that no one could have learnt without help and the easier it is to learn the faster bitcoin will be adopted.
I've had a few downvotes on my explanation so I think it could have been done better. 
Also maybe some people just need to be pointed in the right direction to find answers themselves, but they ask the same question here because they think we know better. (And didn't think of the search bar)

Umm, I would love this. I like gambling, but hate betting against casinos and Sportsbet companies. Better be quick or I'll do it myself.

You will support it by keeping it. If everyone sells iit will be worth nothing.
Correct me if I'm wrong?

Look at altcoins compared to bitcoin instead of USD. They follow it's trend. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:15:05
Now that's an outrageous prediction, you're saying bitcoin will drop to the equivalent of 200usd today again?

Oh I have some guesses. Just want to know how many blocks are left.

According to this subreddit everyone who fuds or sells out bought bitcoin under $100. 
Just stop.

Is this the end of bitcoin?

Coinbase is an online exchange, like a bank. They may not honour a coin split and you may only have bitcoin after the split. 
Bitcoin cash happening on the 1st isn't a real split. It's forced by people upset they couldn't get their own way but will copy your coin holdings onto their Altcoin.
YouTube electrum wallet and send all your bitcoins to your electrum wallet address is the best way.
Exodus is another option, it's waaay more user friendly. Could take you 15 minutes.
If you have issues I can step you through it if you PM me.
You need to do this today to guarantee it will go smoothly for you.

I will hold but also hope it crashes.

I love the last line.
FIND OUT WHY!

..But they have differences in opinion and they split up.
If you side with mummy Btc you can't see daddy btc anymore, and if you side with daddy btc you can't see mummy btc anymore.
If you stay out of it you can still have both bts when they split.

I use CoinJar as I'm Australian. No issues yet. Haven't heard of any except for processing time which seems to be people not understanding. Still waiting for a fiat payment to clear in that account but that's my fault as it's over the max limit so it will take longer to approve. Whoops.

Omg he want a nobel prize. That's why he's doing this!
