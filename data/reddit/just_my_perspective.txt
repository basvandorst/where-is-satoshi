Some people could draw similarities between Bitcoin and a ponzi from the fact that for the price to continue rising, new money needs to continue flowing into the system. So really the profits of those who get in early and sell are coming directly from the investment of those who get in later (exactly how a ponzi works). If Bitcoin was to fail, it pretty much would've been a ponzi from an investment perspective. 
However, the difference is that the bitcoin value is sustainable without new money always entering and its purpose is not to be an investment - that's only due to speculation and price discovery. Eventually it will stabilise in value when an appropriate currency conversion rate is established (assuming other currencies retain their value).

When I was being verified, they said my documents weren't sufficient enough... I just said, "Why not? That's exactly what you asked for..." And they replied with some bullshit like "We just reviewed your documents again and they are sufficient now"
