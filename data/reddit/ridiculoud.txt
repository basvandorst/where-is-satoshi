Hmmm when did the fork happen?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:07:49
Thanks, yea that's the thing...I didn't have any in august....but I somehow have bitcoin cash now 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:14:03
I think I figured it out, I bought some bitcoin back in May, I think it was part of that fork just getting to my account now 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:41:06
Thanks man, it's very little but up is up
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:17:20
Yea, I think we are good....definitely spooked on some of the weird stuff happening with coinbase lately....but I think over night we should see a massive buy of the on-sale bitcoin right now...Asia is just waking up...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:49:00
I'm super confused why I suddenly own bitcoin cash in my coinbase wallet...did I lose some bitcoin?

Fuck Belfort and his cocaine eyes
@_date: 2019-11-14 06:28:31
You mean more of this?lol.....shit has been fucked for a lonnnnnnnng time.
It’s all propped up by companies buying their own stock and foreign money.  Has been for a while.  America was sold out a while ago

Well thats the hard thing about it.
To really “win big” you have buy when it looks like certain doom (blood everywhere) and then sell when people seem to be overconfident ($20,000)
Its hard because people want to dump when losing (who can blame them) and want to hold on to stocks when they blow up (for fear they could get even BIGGER gains if they held for a bit longer)
Its all emotional.  Buffet is saying the right thing, he just is speaking from someone who can use massive capital to buy “pork bellies” or some old school metric when it makes sense to him.
He is not in the bitcoin sphere (or at least says he is not)
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:16:11
Crazy right?
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:56:37
I have no idea why people preach HODL, because when it’s plummeting, it makes no sense to just keep your skin in the game getting torn to shreds.
Pull the money out to keep it safe and buy back when you feel confident it is going up.
We have been in a months long cycle of, stabilization, dump, then stabilization at a lower price, repeated 6 times or so, let someone else get beat up, most people need real money for christmas presents and paying bills.

Lol, “when people stop trusting the BANKS”
The BANKS should stop trusting PEOPLE with lines of credit.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:19:14
Now see, oh you.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:36:39
Look at the fucking stock market and you will see why bitcoin is down.
EVERYTHING IS FUCKING DOWN
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:36:44
No.  The intersection of supply and demand is the equilibrium PRICE.
It has nothing to do with inflation or deflation.

Pussy

To the M.O.ON ok I'm getting out of bed now 
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:27:16
Definitely encouraging the price has held steady.
To the moon!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:17:36
I did as well.  Felt dumb the next day when it went up a bit, but felt vindicated the next day when it started it's current fall and feel even better when it's crashing below $6,000.  
I got out just in time and like you, cannot afford to lose.
Ugh.  I feel bad I didn't sell at $19,000 but I did feel like it was going to go nuclear and hit $50,000 by this time in 2018.  
At this point I may buy back in when it goes lower.
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:44:09
Great detective work! 
It's surely a solid pattern!
See if it works with other denominations!
Oh wait....

Gonna be a bloody Monday
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:46:17
Projecting what?
@_date: 2019-05-25 18:24:33
Lol, I think you are right

Hmmmmmm....resin is usually for making molds, not sure what you mean here.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:02:00
This shit looks so much stupider now

Your gambling example breaks completely down when you are talking about casinos.  They take a percentage off the top of each game regardless of winners and losers and the players are not directly playing against each other.  Throw in the casino leverage and their inherent house advantage and it is very much NOT a zero sum game.
A true zero sum game is between a set number of players, for example a 5 person game of poker where its $100 to buy in.
So, $100 x 5 = $500
Someone is going to win all the money, or people are going to quit with there losses, but at the end of the day, it’s still $500.  There is no external money is being added or subracted, casinos AND bitcoin do not operate at all like that, players join and leave the game constantly and the money itself gets manipulated into different values.
It really comes down to the players entering and leaving the game, we do not keep track of that in bitcoin and most casino games, that is where the suckers get raked.
You saying there is “no risk in bitcoin and only significant gains to be had” shows me you are a clown (or likely a shill) and have no real understanding of investing.
Babe Ruth would be ashamed.

You are seriously delusional if you think Bitcoin is any real “threat” to Buffet or the world banking system.
He is not in the least affected even if bitcoin moons.  It is just another bucket to exploit for the big guys.  
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:31:46
Ya think?

Bro, leave the big-words to people that actually understand how to use them.
