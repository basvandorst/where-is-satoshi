It isn't 4pm London time.
It's 3pm Central Time, as in Chicago, Illinois where the Chicago Mercantile Exchange operates.

So any form of competition is considered an attack?

You just walked into a crowded auditorium and yelled, "What's the difference between Democrats and Republicans?"  :D
I can hear Red Foreman saying "Dumb ass!"   :D

You tell me.  If they're not competition, how can they be considered an attack?

I figured out a while back that I control the crypto prices.  If I sell, they go up.
If I buy, they go down.  :D
I've become a hodler.

In addition to what some of the others have rightly stated, I would also include that Google likely has little interest in blockchain because blockchain is immutable.  Google has no problem with manipulating or deleting any information they need changed in order to maximize profits or further their political bias.  Google is a politically connected company primarily motivated by greed, power and control. 
They are absolutely Establishment in every sense of the word.

So you have anxiety that it may drop, but you know if you cash out the taxes and your family are going to spend all the money...
Think about the logic (lack of) in that.
If you have anxiety, sell just enough to get yourself into a different hobby.  Something that will fill your time and attention.  Forget about your bitcoins.  
A few years from now, when you are an adult, they will be there waiting for you.
Then you can buy a house or car or whatever.
They're not going away.
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, but up.

Well, I would expect the price would go through the roof at first, and many would be selling but the buyers would be those few. (even the Fed could do this secretly with printed money)
But then once the available to trade coins were bought up, trade volumes would fall to very low levels.  At that point, would the lack of market liquidity cause the price to fall also?  If so, then I can see why it would not be wise on their part. (Although I can think of other reasons why it would also not be wise)
Most of it's long term value comes from it's usability, and if it were not fluid, there would be no usability.  So I guess maybe I've answered my own question.
Too much time on my hands this morning I guess.  My mind tends to wonder.

Anyone who thinks they can keep pushing for division, and keep damaging the brand without eventually hurting themselves is a fool.  Money has poured into Bitcoin because we believe in it.
When it's no longer trustable, and we (the masses) collectively stop believing in it, it will collapse like the twin towers on 9-11.  The same money that has flowed in like a river, will flow out like a dam-break.  I hope people will get their heads out of their asses, swallow their pride and come together to save it.

I don't know much about the Bitcoin argument, just what I've been reading over the last few months.
What I do know is this...
Whether it's BTC, BCH, Ether, Democrats, Republicans, Tories, Labor, Catholics, Protestants, IRA,  Jews, Palestinians, Muslims, Communists, Socialists, Christians or Anarchists, as long as people keep being selfish, demanding their way, hateful, spiteful, bitter, divisive, conniving, greedy,  deceitful, dishonest, unyielding and evil, NOTHING WILL EVER BE SOLVED, CHANGED FOR THE BETTER, OR WORLD PEACE ACHIEVED.  EVER.
We reap what we sow.
What goes around, eventually comes around.
That's my two cents.

A dip or slight drop is not a crash.
A crash is a major drop.

I guess it all depends on what a person wants to do with their life.  Find something you enjoy doing which also allows a lot of tax deductions, or be prepared to bend over for Uncle Sam. :)

It may be that the weak link in Satoshi's vision was the need and dependence on massive amounts of electricity, and how much cheaper and controllable that resource is in certain countries.  
I guess time will tell.

Bitcoin may go on to hit $1 million plus, but I don't blame you at all.  There are few things as gratifying as being completely debt-free.  Kudos!

Cash out in January and buy a farm in a Midwest state.  Missouri is a good choice.  Everything you do on a farm is a tax write-off.  You can operate a farm at a loss and still have all the fresh steak and veges you can eat.  Use solar and wind for your power, with battery backup.  Build a large barn, and live in the upstairs.  My sister had a beautiful home which was entirely inside of a barn.  All a tax write-off.

BCH claims faster transaction times with lower fees.  But so do dozens of other crypto currencies, so... 
I don't know what else it can do other than say "we are following Satoshi's white paper more accurately than Bitcoin".   I really don't see how that makes it worth $1500, but apparently someone is willing to pay it.
It seems to me that there are lots of cryptos that are better than both of them.  Just my opinion.

"We" did little to affect this.
There are a whole lotta folks in China.
They are the ones who did most of this.
The rumors came out, they panicked and sold.  Price fell.  By the time the China bank authorities confirmed what was actually going on, many of "us" were buying in at discounted prices.

He's telling you all 3 years in advance and you're acting like he's saying wait till it's about to happen and then buy.
Why are there so many rude, acid-tongued people here?  This isn't high school.  Even if you disagree with his premise, it's still a good idea to buy and hold bitcoin, regardless.  So why all the hate?  This forum seems to have a lot of toxic people in it.  Makes me want to spend less time here.

Because most of us are not able to acquire Bitcoin without buying it with fiat.  Because we buy with fiat we don't want to trade and miss out on future gains.  If we were being paid bitcoin from our regular employers, it would be much easier to trade or spend it.
