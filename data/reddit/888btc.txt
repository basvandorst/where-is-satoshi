Maybe they are just trying to understand how Bitcoin works.  Its very common for this to happen when there are a lot of inputs and people don't realize a higher fee is needed.  Also if we had less block-filling pressure then those fees would be less.

Dr. Craig Wright advocating for privacy here. Seems grey market is right up his alley:

It was right around the holidays and he was moving to another country and under assault by the australian tax agency the day the story leaked. Maybe he needed time to think everything out and decide if he would come out of the closet, and the process to do so. It seems he is going about a very specific process to prove he is Satoshi cryptographically with some big names in the community. It was reported that John Matonis is involved but could not speak on it because he is under a non-disclosure agreement.
Cryptographically proving it may be simple. But then you have issues of witnesses and verifications. There is a human element to it as well. If not done properly or if not well thought out, it could lead to doubts, and then a firestorm in the community. It is best to plan it out to minimize that firestorm. Also there is the security of the keys at hand. They need to be kept secured and not subject to hacking, including side channel attacks. We are talking 1.1 million bitcoin at stake here. Every precaution needs to be made to prove there were no tricks involved.
There are also lawyers and things involved as well, and non-disclosure agreements according to the article.  So its not a simple process.

Welcome to communism.  Everyone needs permission to conduct human activities.  My advice would be to forget the licenses and permits and just go rogue agorist style.  Trying to comply just puts a target on your back anyways.  Look what happened to Charlie Shrem when he tried cozying up to regulators meeting with them once a week in New York.  Now he has been in jail for 1 year.  Sad, but true story.
@_date: 2016-04-17 07:29:02
You are right but people will misconstrue what you said to say that Capitalism is bad and leads to tyranny.  Its not capitalism that leads to tyranny, its absence of Capitalism that leads to tyranny.
@_date: 2016-04-01 18:18:16
Everyone breaks simple laws every day. [Everything is illegal](  So to say Shrem simply broke laws is wrong.  He cuddled up with regulators meeting them every week.  It was the fact that he tried obeying the laws and licking boots that got him in trouble.  If he was just a rogue guy flying under the radar he would probably be free today.  In fact I remember criticizing him at one point before he got in trouble for cozying up to regulators and predicted it would bite him back and it did.
You are right communism and authoritarianism do go hand and hand.  More accurately it is called totalitarianism.  Like that described in the dystopian novel 1984 by George Orwell.  Also technocracy is a new word used to describe it and is what GMaxwell and BlockStream Core want for Bitcoin, they want technocracy where they are the Lords over us.  Socialism and communism may sound good on paper but it turns into facism the marriage of corporations and government.  Corruption takes hold when you have a big government.  That is why communism is so bad and can never work.  Capitalism does not really couple with authoritarianism.  Only crony capitalism can do so, which is not true free market capitalism.  Socialists and Marxists will blame capitalism and say capitalism turns to facism.  But its government that creates the facism as capitalism slips away due to regulation and corruption of people who use the government to enforce their monopolies and oligopolies.

Sounds like a bit of cognitive dissonance.  Everyone has wanted to follow Satoshi's vision for a long time.  It was censorship, and usurpers who stopped that.  Its more like all the losers who have been attacking his vision and usurping Bitcoin for their own ends will be forced to adapt to Satoshi's vision or quit Bitcoin like some such as Gmaxwell have said they would do if Satoshi is indeed Wright and Bitcoin goes for bigger blocks.
@_date: 2016-04-01 01:02:31
Well I think you are very wrong and will be proven wrong soon.  We will find out.
@_date: 2016-04-01 03:06:53
Well its based on historical happenings when people got SWATed after using purse: 
 Then purse offered 10,000 dollar in insurance to anyone who got wrongly SWATed, which for me is not enough.  I understand purse is trying to combat such things, but if you think its not going on a % of the time, then you really must have bought into the story that the huge discounts are all from people getting rid of their old amazon gift cards.  These are facts, so don't imply that I am a liar.
@_date: 2016-04-01 02:56:54
Plus the added risk of getting SWATed because the guy who fulfilled your purse order was using stolen CC info.  But could be worth the risk for some people.

Government is not your friend. Would you jump into an alligator pit for $23 or $200?
@_date: 2016-03-23 23:18:32
No it has not been implemented.  Actually I am worried it will never be implemented due to the politics involved with making changes to the Bitcoin protocol.  Even a simple blocksize increase has become very painful, nevermind something controversial like anonymity or privacy.
@_date: 2016-03-31 21:46:51
That was a lie that it never existed by the way.
@_date: 2016-03-31 20:53:36
This could be good if he is really Satoshi, although some of the Core people might not like it because it seems Dr. Wright is for a blocksize increase and is working on scaling research for Bitcoin with his supercomputer named "tulip".
Also he claims to have 1,100,111 BTC in his [Tulip Trust]( which could be used for "enhancing the position and value of Bitcoin" according to the document.  
So what do you guys think this could do to the price if it is true?  Another interesting dynamic that may come into play is even with cryptographic evidence, there still may be some doubt.  Egos are very strong in this community and some may become "deniers" not ready to admit that Dr. Wright is Satoshi.  Then again it could actually be a hoax in the end.  Anyways it is sure to be another exciting month in Bitcoin Land.
@_date: 2016-03-31 23:37:23
Seems its been going on behind scenes a bit.  John Matonis said he signed a non-disclosure agreement.  Something big is going on.  For the ones denying it all, I wonder why Matonis would mention such a thing, he must be a trollcow too? I wonder if you will continue denying once faced with cryptographic evidence of the Satoshi?  My guess is you will go down with the Core ship with Gmax and BlockStream at the helm.
@_date: 2016-03-22 21:32:26
Yeah he is already in the pit, lol.  We are all in it I guess for even using Bitcoin.  But I am going to swim in the opposite direction of the alligators any chance I get instead of swimming towards them.
@_date: 2016-03-31 23:27:17
I see a lot of evidence.  For one Wright seems to agree and promote Satoshi's vision.  He also uses similar linguistic style as Satoshi, and the Tulip Trust seems to be a real thing.  Also he has not denied he is Satoshi.  Only other explanation is a hoax which would be a lot less likely, and extremely crazy and difficult to ever pull off.
@_date: 2016-03-31 21:24:29
Some claimed to prove it.  I think Greg Maxwell went to great lengths to discredit Dr. Wright as Satoshi.  It was very complicated explanation and I don't think most people took the time to understand it and just kind of took his word for it. I read through it deeply and carefully and I was not convinced. I could see a lot of explanations that countered some of Maxwell's points.
Edit: As I remember even Maxwell had his doubts about his own findings.  He said my findings are what they are, and he said "hey maybe the dude is indeed satoshi anyways".  He was just noting some discrepancies in the keys, which could have several explanations.
@_date: 2016-03-22 21:42:23
Here is a good talk by Greg Maxwell on Confidential Transactions: 
Starts around 35 minute mark.

It seems Craig is a libertarian, he wouldn't be afraid of such "grey market" activities.  Everything is a grey market these days, you can't function in society anymore without breaking some laws and rules and regulations.  Some people are not cowards and they are going to live their life and not get permission all the time.  Is it illegal to buy or own a super computer?  Why would such a thing being bought in the grey or black market be illegal? Maybe Craig just wanted privacy, ya know Satoshi was a pretty private guy after all.
There could be many reasons why the SGI would deny something.  Maybe they are scared of some regulation they may have violated.  Maybe they want to protect their own privacy.  Maybe they contacted some associate of Craig Wright and not Wright himself.  There are millions of explanations, and anyone could take one fact and twist into something completely different calling Dr. Wright a liar with no definitive proof.
@_date: 2016-03-31 22:10:38
Its a lie.  Even in that link you sent it suggests that he did likely purchase the computer on the grey market and that some company simply "did not have the record" of it.  So people are twisting words to make lies that suit their agenda, what else is knew.

I love Coinbase.  Only people in censored forums seem to hate coinbase.  They are actually really awesome and trustworthy company.  If it were not for Coinbase Bitcoin would not be where it is today.
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:30:21
Sorry for this mistake.  My guess is that you sent the Bitcoin to some type of service or website.  That is why the wallet was emptied so fast.  Many exchanges and websites will do this and empty the wallet immediately into cold storage or other wallet when they receive funds to their addresses.  Think hard about which services you have sent Bitcoin to.  Then contact the service and tell them your mistake, and there is good chance they will send you the money back.
@_date: 2016-05-04 07:03:24
Satoshi must have got his recent blog post title from you.  He seems to agree ;)
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:03:14
Prediction...Satoshi will move some coins, people will claim they are only "loosely" tied to Satoshi, so he will move yet more coins, and provide more proof, and more and more proof.  Then some people will still try to make claims that he is a scammer.  But reasonable people who do not live in delusion will know the truth.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:16:27
I also believe beyond reasonable doubt that Craig is Satoshi, and I would like to thank Dr. Craig Wright, Satoshi for inventing Bitcoin.  It has changed and improved my life in ways that you could not imagine. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:43:18
Well this is going to be another good piece of evidence.  A lot of evidence piling up soon.  Maybe a lot of people will start accepting that he is truly Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:27:22
It is also possible that those 1.1 million bitcoins will be used to enhance the value and position of Bitcoin: 
Craig has said he is working on scaling solutions with his supercomputers.  Could be very good for the Bitcoin network if the funds are used to enhance Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-27 18:35:35
Coinbase is pretty cool I think.  They were not wrong about blocksize but just supporting Satoshi's vision and common sense.  That being said I would recommend to not use 3rd party hosted wallets for spending wallets.  You are trusting them to hold your coins and you will need their permission to spend them.  Use your own wallet like Electrum, Multi-bit, Mycelium, etc... Then you control your own coins and do not need permission to spend them, and nobody can take them away from you.  For best security for a spending wallet I would highly suggest a hardware wallet like Trezor, Ledger, or KeepKey, so it can be in your posession and also completely safe from hackers and easily spendable as well.
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:29:52
Everyone will laugh at you in a few days as more evidence comes out proving Wright as Satoshi, and you can no longer deny it.

Still think its an April fools joke?

Even if the ECDSA was weak, it would only affect things when you spend coins.  When you sign a transaction you are using the ECDSA algorithm.  This signed transaction is broadcast to the public network.  Since it is secure cryptography nobody is able to determine the private key from the signature.  But if the crypto was weak or broken, or subject to quantum attack, then they could use the signature to determine the key.  
So perhaps this is why maybe Satoshi did not want the signed transaction public.  Although this is a security concern for Bitcoin, it only effects things if you use the same address twice.  Because once the coins are moved, you no longer need to worry about the security of that private key associated with that address.
There are ways to possibly update the type of signatures used in Bitcoin to be more secure against things like quantum attacks.  I believe Lamport signatures are one that some people like Vitalik Buterin have proposed which would be quantum resistant.
Also Satoshi does not own all 21 million coins.  He only owns about 1.1 million or so according to the [Tulip trust document](  And if he signed transactions it would only be one key that is vulnerable to ECDSA weakness, not all of his keys since his coins reside in many different addresses.  Hope that helps clarify things a bit.  Sorry people here are bit cold to newbies.  You could try some other subs as well as the bitcoinbeginner sub as well for more friendly atmosphere.

I believe his motive is that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.  And a bunch of people are calling him a fraud and a scammer.  So he needs to uphold his name and prove he is really the man.  He preferred to stay anonymous, but hackers and media outed him last summer.  Since then people have been lying about him saying he is a scammer and fraud.  So he is saving his reputation and he seems to have no choice.  This is also what Craig said in his video interview.  Also Gavin says the same thing in this interview: 
@_date: 2016-05-04 04:07:09
There were at least two supercomputers spoken of by Satoshi.  One called Coin and another called Tulip I believe.  Some people tried making a fake story that the computers did not exist but I looked into it and it was a complete hogwash FUD story.
@_date: 2016-05-04 06:49:21
Getting worried that you made an idiot of yourself yet?  Proof keeps coming that you were completely wrong and a liar.  I guess my prediction was accurate.  But I bet lowly people like you will not apologize at all for the lies that you spread about Satoshi the man who gave us Bitcoin, will you?

I don't use i-phone, but I believe Mycelium works well on both Android and i-phone.  Also I have heard good things about Bread Wallet on i-phone as well.  Just remember to back up your wallet.  Most wallets are hierarchical deterministic wallets or HD wallets now so you only need to back them up one time.  Most wallets will now give a word list and you just write down the word list as your backup, which I think is the easiest and safest way.
Also one cool thing about hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger, is you can use them to interface with Mycelium wallet on smart phones by just plugging them in with an OTG cable into your phone.  So you got the best of both worlds, convenience in spending and also top security.
