Why would anyone give you a "deal" when they can just sell on an exchange at market rate and not risk getting scammed?
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:24:55


Hm, you did something wrong every step of the way? You broke rule 1: don't invest more than you can afford to lose. You broke rule number 2: don't sell at a loss. As for putting your rent money into this, I suggest you get out of this market right now.

Don't suppose you know how competitive they are compared to credit cards, inclusive of companies that process over 1 mil? Plus, even though they don't have "fees", they can still manipulate the price and take a profit by modifying their exchange rate of BTC &gt; USD right?

The cost still affects the merchant. Their end-clients end up paying more. If they were willing to charge their clients more, they might as well keep the profits for themselves.

Ok, I was originally going to downvote this for a misleading title and what was most likely spam. But I found your post mildly amusing. +1 to you good sir.

I don't think it is malware. I opened the PDF but it does look fake as hell. They say bitcoins were"stoled" from customer accounts. :/

Yes, they ban for people spamming illegible nonsense to try and raise the standard of chat. I'm sure the community, unlike yourself, is happy to see stuff like "QUARK ON GOX" removed.

When I say "stupid", perhaps I mean "simplistic". There were so many signs that mtgox situation was not looking good, so if they were smart they would have pulled out earlier. It's almost like they could set up a bot to autotrade based off an RSS reader fed from [cant remember name of the coin news site] and sell based off keywords. But it means that they have no balls to support the currency and want to jump ship asap. I don't see how this is the kinda thing people support. I sure don't like it when the price drops and surges dramatically and I know others don't either. It just adds fuel to the fire that it is caused by a news article.
As for the Russia thing, it is semi related but I'd say this is mainly mtgox related. Consider the fact that $300 was knocked off gox to a point where btc-e was actually trading more than them for once (aka mtgox took the major blow over the rest of the market).

I don't even know what your post is about. But them's fighting words.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:40:13
Dude you should take up this offer, are you won't be "making out" with anything from gox in a while. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 12:36:29
Won't avoid they fees. They go through bitpay or coinbase anyway, which charge fees.
@_date: 2014-01-21 13:19:41
Well I was simply asking the question rather than implying anything. As for your example, that's not a great argument. If someone wants to pay for a $20 product, who is to say the processor couldn't charge $40 worth of the market value in BTC? They come up with the rates after all. 
A lot of the industry in currency conversion works like this and if I walk down the street in my city, many currency conversion places will advertise $0 fees but make their commission by offering poor conversion rates. 
In the example you have made, I could click "buy" on a $20 item and pay with BTC, in which case it asks me for 1000 BTC to complete purchase. This is purely an example, but shows how they could. 
Anyway, I would be surprised if they didn't charge a commission under $1mil. How are they supposed to support so many payments (and provide support to the vendor) for free? They aren't a charity.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:39:11
Oui, je would like to regarde it as well. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:08:26
If it was about doge, it most likely was. People have been spamming doge crap for a while so as an exchange that doesn't even support doge, why the hell would they want their chat box filled with discussion like this? 
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:00:53
Besides the fact that people have pointed out that you're an 18 year old kid with a company that does $0 in revenue and cannot technically be a CEO, you don't have what it takes to be a CEO even if you were qualified. Being a CEO means you are in charge of peoples lives; you manage revenue so you can pay your employees and they can buy their groceries, whilst keeping the business afloat and profitable. What you are proposing is extremely risky and also doesn't make any sense. How are you going to going to not "spend any of the bitcoin", when you can't pay your vendors and other stake holders with this currency? Misleading title and thread is misleading.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:19:39
Downvote for being the big bang theory.

In a market that gained... 5000% ROI last year? I think it's safe to say that panic selling after the market appears to crash is not a great idea (as OP discovered). You are free to trade however you want.

They are operating pretty alright if you ask me and are doing a lot better than many other mainstream exchanges out there. Besides, I'm not the idiot who just got scammed by a random malicious party on skype and then makes a post on reddit that you still haven't chosen to take down, despite being false and defamatory. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:50:49
I take it you didn't read the replies to your own thread telling you that it wasn't actually BTC-E you were talking to on skype? And people aren't always allowed to voice their opinion. If you made those defamatory comments about an established business, they could take you to court for defaming them with your conversation with a random party that you falsely claim is a BTC-E representative. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:27:27
The guy in that thread seems like an idiot.

Unfortunately, this is a bit above my level. I'd love to be able to do stuff like this in Python but can't really code anything useful yet.

You lost $410k. Get out now and never invest again. You might you want to seek advice in the same way that a problem gambler would.

Jesus dude. The guy didn't even seem EXTREMELY PLEASED that you were willing to send them back a massive amount of cash that was irreversible.

I like how you just made a post about how bitcoins are lost forever compared to fiat, where the post above you discusses a potential solution to get them back.
@_date: 2013-12-30 07:10:50
I hope this is all true. Pump pump pump!
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:41:22
In general I would say the bigger the exchange, the quicker the buy/sell, as there are more people out there to either buy or sell you coins. This is assuming that the website backend is competent and speedy as well.
I use btc-e.com and I would say that is a good option. Having never used mtgox, I would assume that is good as well.
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:31:16
As someone who bought in relatively high and rode the crash all the way to the crash bottom, I wouldn't mind it. But yes, obviously long term stability and steady growth is preferable.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:21:08
Ahhh, thanks! I had been clicking that button and similar ones before but I had mistakenly misinterpreted the buy and sell functionality on it. Hmm... so this means you can convert BTC to USD directly on btc-e as well?
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:57:07
This site has been pretty bad for me. They never filled a buy order I put in a few weeks ago. Their site is horrible. Now when I try to make any transaction, it tells me I have insufficient funds. I'd avoid it as there are much better alternatives out there.

The single line doesn't represent one person, it represents a single price (at which multiple people could be buying/selling at) afaik? Also your other points prove absolutely nothing at all.
All this speculative pricing will indeed indeed to a crash once the bubble pops. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:36:28
It looks like people are debating the percentages but your main point is very clear and I agree with it. I'm kinda surprised that the OP wants to not withdraw any of it.  Consider your scenario of bitcoin crashing tomorrow and going to $0 (which is very possible), how absolutely horribly butthurt would OP feel at not even getting a cent out of this opportunity? Now.. if he was able to take out a few grand (whether it be $20-75k etc.), and then bitcoin crashes to $0, he can still feel pretty awesome that he made that cash. If it doesn't crash, well hey, at least you have the rest of the coins to maintain that investment.
