A:  That's not what dunning-kruger means
B:  I also missed out by not investing on any number of stocks that went off.  Asset speculation is just that.

Bitcoin is essentially speculation that everyone is dumber than you are.  It has no fundamental value beyond being a useful transaction tool for those seeking anonymity (and even then its efficacy is limited), and a safe harbour for those seeking to minimise tail risk, which has ballooned prices of many assets since the GFC, such as gold.  But there are far superior tools, all it has going for it is first movers advantage and network effects.
It will crash, the only question is when.  Making money on speculation is simple if everyone is doing it.  Anyone can look smart if the market just keeps going up.  But it never does.

The blockchain is far more useful than Bitcoin itself

It is a fraud, consistent price movements that show no respect for fundamentals (which bitcoin doesn't have) should make that obvious.

Madoff was brilliant!


Sometimes I wonder whether or not I'm knowledgeable enough to make trades.
And then I remember people like you exist.

Bitcoin isn't a currency.
