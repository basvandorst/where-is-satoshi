How does this influence the price of Bitcoin and the transaction volume on the blockchain?
@_date: 2016-08-30 22:21:09
At localbitcoins the weekly need for Bitcoins is around 15 Mio USD.  This is about 2 Millions USD in Bitcoins needed daily.
This is actually more then the current supply of 1800 Bitcoins/day. The only question is how big are the stocks Bitcoin sellers are holding.
At current price (575 USD) the dialy output is 1 Mio USD. If we calculate this with the daily need at localbitcoins we see that we are short 1 Mio USD  (2mio demand - 1mio supply)
My best guess is that we continue to see a triangle pattern  in the next few month until the markets gets dried out and rises to a new highs.
To meet the demand at localbitcoins the fair price would be around 1100 USD

Not sure how it works technically but I assume it works like this:
1) Everyperson gets a certain bitcoin address loaded with 1 microbitcoin.
2) If the person votes Yes he/she sends the bitcoin to YES bitcon address via versa.
Since the blockchain is open to everybody votes are absolutely transparent. If one party does not agrees with the voting the can analyze the bitcoin transaction.
ps:The bitcoins can be later reused for another vote...smart smart.
 that  they send some small amount of bitcoins to for a VOTE YES to a bitcoin address and vote NO to another bitcoinaddress

I have stopped accepting Litcoins for my web business because
1) I has only 3 LC payments in one year (I have 3 BC payment daily)
2) It has nothing to offer new which Bitcoin already has.
3) All the Ecosystem and venture capital flowing into Bitcoin not Litecoin.
Litcoin dies a slow painful dead!!!

I will most likely run a one month test-run and check if I am loosing business with this approach.
We have to start sensibilize customers and show them that there are better systems out there. If I take a minor hit (less buying customers) thats OK with me. Somebody has to start with it anyway. Hope some of my follow Bitcoiners will follow suit.

I consider the ETF/Wall Street involvment is way more critical than the last "Chinese Bubble" we had.
Once that ETF is out we could see a rally way over 1000USD. We have overwhelmingly good news these days. More and more people will start trusting the network and they will use Bitcoin not only for transaction but also as store of value. 
I am with Bitcoin for over 3 years now and never have been more bullish.

200'000'000 USD could buy right now around 350'000 coins.
The higher the price the more willing are people to sell. I roughly estimate the price would go 500 USD up. Maybe more if we see another panic buying.

Yes, it is absolutely possible.
Right now we are creating the infrastructure for Bitcoin. This will take a while because existing businesses (Banks, Western Union, etc) do not support us. We have to build up everything from scratch. 
It is absolutely possible that we hit first 100USD before we hit 1000 and above!

Most likely it has to do with this
In short, they will pay anybody who runs devices to support their network in Bitcoin. This will increase the demand, but dont know how many bitcoins they need to purchase monthly to keep the system running.
If the project would be a success and the payout daily would be 1 million USD, they would absorb easly the daily created 3600 Bitcoins
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:23:18

I guess with Rakutens 30% discount any Bitcoin purchases over 100USD...hey thats a great bargain!!!!!! The number will eventually come down a bit, but rest assured that in one year we are looking at around 300'000 transaction at least.
Also FACTCOM had its initial selling of its coin which only could be purchased via Bitcoin.

Is there any test client application website I can have a look at? 
I mean when my clients send Bitcoins, they must be presented with a QR Code or BTC Address.

I guess it wont be Bitcoin. Banks want have control over their systems. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 00:30:47
Higher Bitcoin price! 
Lets say they are holding 100'000 Bitcoins and the price of Bitcoin in 5 years is 10'000USD then it would be worth 1 billion USD.
@_date: 2015-04-13 17:44:53
Let's face the fact that we are scared that IBM, Samsung, etc would come up with a better idea and the Bitcoin price would fall into a black hole!

@_date: 2015-04-30 15:36:28
We are still in the "building infrastructure" phase. I do not see a real demand which bitcoin could rise new price levels right now. The demand we see right now is only speculative. (ETF, GBTC, Sweden's Nasdaq exchange )
During the last two years  we have seen tons of those "positive news" but with price declining. We might see 150USD before we see 1000USD
Once the news titles show up like "bitcoin overseas remittance is taking up steam"...at this point we will have a real SUSTAINABLE demand.
We will eventually fly much futher then to the moon! More like flying through a black hole into a new dimension.

According to  we would need an additional 16%- 20% more hashing power (currently at 35%) to form the longest chain.
I am willing to take on this risk! Lets snowball UASF!!

@_date: 2015-11-04 02:58:07
How does it work? Using Electrum 2.5.2.
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:08:15
Hey Luke, what is your strategy after 1st of August. Will you sell the coins on on the NON SEGWIT chain? I am seriously wondering how we can get the economic majority against those very filthy rich Big Blocker.

The only place where you could hide your cash would be Bitcoin!

No question about it. It is technically superior but money is still the root of all evil. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:07:53
I guess it going to be the first "smart communication device" running on blockchain technology. The only thing I am wondering is whay ASCI involvement? The only thing ASCI does is hashing.
My guess is that this device is not mining bitcoin itself but it is mining something different, something that is not that hard to mine like Bitcoins.
So clearly they are trying to build a network which consist of your phone which you always carry arround and this new ASCI device.

Once Bitcoin becomes an accepted store of value, drug cartels will gladly accept Bitcoins since they cant be stolen from them like cash.
In 5 years from now Street Dealers wont  accept only Bitcoin, eliminating the need of changing fiat to bitcoin.
So in the end, the Drug Lord will receive its full 5 Million!
Jeffery Robinson, can't think around the corner.

Thanks for the info. 
Please correct me if I am wrong. Ver and Jhian are extremely rich, they could easily sell the SEGWIT chain for hundreds of million dollars. I assume miners will mine the most valuable chain to boost profits. Is that correct?

Even if you do not own big portions of Bitcoins you still can us it as a payment system. I save monthly more then 600 USD on commission by using Bitcoin instead of PayPal. This number would be even higher if all my customers would use Bitcoin.
Remember, Bitcoin is much more then just a plain currency.

I just made my calculation by saying that the money would stay at least 1 day in the wallet before changed to paper money.

As long China will buy US Treasury nothing will happen, but once the shit hits the fan (treasuries) Could be this year 2014.
Banksters abandon the sinking ship before the public will know and therefore Bitcoin will increase in value before the epic crash will happen.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:36:41
It could be a scenario but not likely to happen. The banksters know that the system (stock market, bonds) will collapse eventually (2014). With a 10 year treasury yield of 3% and raising... GOD BLESS AMERICA! Banksters buying Bitcoin instead to be on the save side .....abandon ship!
