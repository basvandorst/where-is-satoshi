I've always thought about publishing news onto the blockchain. Good luck censoring something that's just metadata attached to a global financial system.

From the whitepaper itself, only trusted partners will be allowed to run "verification nodes".

So an oligarchy of wealthy people instead of just one? Not an improvement imo.


For now. But the currency is controlled by less than 100 companies, that probably have a huge vested interest in inflating the currency and fractional reserve banking...
I absolutely do not trust it.

To who though? They own the codebase and the nodes and all the assets represented on the blockchain. It's a closed system.

Yeah, so China is processing several _trillion_ dollars a year on mobile payments. WeChat Payments is like Visa big over there.

If you made money on it, it wasn't a bad investment.
You can always "what if", but it's not helpful.

There is an actual Transaction Fee (TX), which varies but it's currently quite low. You can pay more to have a better chance of getting into the next block, but you can also pay a lower TX fee and just sit in the pool for a few extra blocks. For a withdrawal transaction that you're performing maybe once a month, you can be cheap and wait an extra hour :P
