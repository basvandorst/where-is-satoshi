Since this app works p2p, what happens when some people are not online when a transaction has to be signed? How will they receive the transaction hex? Does someone of the group has to stay online all the time until everyone has downloaded the transaction hex?

Legalizing corruption (lobbying) is even worse. However, I'm not talking about the EU. The EU is way too undemocratic and untransparent, what caues (indeed) a lot of corruption.

nah, integrity and transparency are the key words. Extrending favours is something completely different than the stuff is gaining power for Montesanto the USA and in the EU. That stuff is called money and backdoor politics. A good politician should be integer and be able to explain all his decisions while he's in the center of the public intrest. When the people of a country are educated enough, they will understand the descisions the politcian has made. Populism will be reduced when you invest in education.

Saving is not good. While many people in the bitcoin community say saving is good since it's better for the environment to consume less, this also withholds market-driven innovation in markets in other green markets. Innovation and the future of our societiy is slowed down by deflation. If you want a more ecological sustainable economy, you should buy co2-neutral products, solar panels, etc. Anything to stimulate innovation within these markets.

I thought Hive iOS was decentralized since it runs the complete backend of HiveJS on the phone itself using Apache Cordova. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I'm right Coindesk might tone down a bit. This isn't their first time they're wrong.

That's not because of progessives. It's mainly because lobbying is legal and normal in your country. This creates legal oligopoly or monopoly (for example the interior designers in Washtington). The Netherlands is a socialist en progessive country, however lobbying is not legal here (ofc it still happens  but not on the foreground) and starting a business is easy as fuck. People even get certain tax reductions here when you start your own business.

I agree with the fact that not all innovation is good. However, the way the economy works in this day is not sustainable and can't flourish for centuries. All I'm trying to say is that people should not sit on their money but spend it on things that are the future, such as fair-trade products and green power, in order to create a more sustainable future.

I understand your point. People should always have something for a rainy day. However, I'm tackling the argument that the deflationary aspect of bitcoin is a good thing (something that's also suggested in the OP) and that people should consume less.
Nevertheless, some money in your backpocket is never wrong.
