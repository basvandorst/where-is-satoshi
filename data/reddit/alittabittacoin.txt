A little dramatic to pronounce BTC's demise. But yes, the protracted (and extremely childish / unprofessional) discussion isn't good for BTC's image.

Wrong. You sell high and you buy back low. And when there are clearly issues like there are now, you need to tinker routinely to a) increase your holdings of BTC b) maintain / increase the fiat value of your holdings. Anyone who bought at $1275 or $1175 or $1075 should have sold and should be looking to buy back in when BTC reaches a price which actually reflects the confidence and stability of the market.
Anyone who simply recommends to HODL at all cost, no matter what, is simply wrong.

Yes, but the trading volume doesn't come close to comparing with BitStamp and BitFinex. Are you saying that Kraken is the smart place to buy, and the others are better to sell on? I guess I'm wondering if the trends I've noticed, and what I've deduced from them, are common-knowledge :)
edit: comparing

"The news coverage itself from a menial &amp; inaccurate headline is still coverage."
Yes, terribly inaccurate and misleading coverage, which actually SCARES the masses AWAY from BTC, perpetuating the negative image BTC so desperately needs to shed. Or it attracts a whole bunch of speculators to the currency, perpetuating violent swings, which in turn perpetuate negative stories of volatility, underpinning the mainstream argument that BTC is not a safe investment for the vast majority of people.

Yes, but the masses do not.

The biggest issues right now are all related to fear and lack of confidence due to a) the BU fiasco b) price of BTC remained near all-time-highs even after the ETF was denied, indicating a price which isn't in sync with actual market value.
The debate on scaling has simmered to a boil, and now, punches are being thrown. Not good for stability, or confidence at all. I see a bear market in the weeks ahead.

thanks for the lead, makes sense :)

Study up on BTC like a book worm before buying. But yes, the cryptocurrency space is a very interesting one indeed, with huge potential upsides, and solid fundamentals.

Yes, anonymity is a vital and attractive feature of BTC today. So is its decentralized nature, etc... However, I would argue that 99% of the population are already resigned to living in a surveyed world, with a flawed and massively inflated currency, so why would THEY care? It's precisely this lack of 'currency oversight' or 'control' that scares the general population away from embracing BTC (rightly or wrongly, and irrespective of their understanding of the fundamentals of currency valuation, or of the legitimacy of said 'control', or 'oversight')
When governments unveil / transition to their own cryptocurrencies, who will / can even stand up for the value of anonymity? 
The shift towards a govt backed crypto would be so swift, there would never even be a chance to discuss it. Very similar to how much pushback there was to the news that the NSA was engaged in a public massive surveillance operation a few years ago, or when the UK gradually built up 'big brother'; hardly any.
So BTC remains valuable only as long as governments haven't all legislated to make it nearly impossible to use BTC for the average person (ie: retail). And BTC becomes REALLY valuable if fiat currency-based economies implode in a dramatic fashion.

meanwhile, in Greece, 1 bitcoin = 5000 gyros
