Why isn't anybody stating the obvious... let miners point their cex.io ghs to the pool of their choice.
I read cex said they'd allow/enable it the last time they approached 50%, but they haven't. Until they do, cex is every bit as shitty as any US cell network or ISP - building "loyalty" through vendor lock-in.

Yes, but if they are BIP38 encrypted with a good password it would be difficult for him or her to crack. Cold storage you didn't print yourself is not for the paranoid. For the super paranoid you basically need to chisel your own cold storage which you generated on an air gapped computer using software you wrote and compiled with your own compiler on silicon you made.

A man with a plan... +1 internets I'm curious, did you just give them a letter to open in the event, or is it something formal, like attached to your will?

Hilarious that you won't mine with eligius on principle, because it's run by a religious fanatic, but you have no principles when it comes to sticking with a pool that doesn't seem to have any regard for Bitcoin.
I'm curious, would you reconsider mining at GHash if it emerged that they were perpetrating withholding attacks against the other pools to reduce those pools' luck?

Woot! I sent my first tip! ...this is the way we ball

I meant 17 partners in total and calculated $2250 for the S2, because I didn't know you could get a discount through a group buy. I also priced in $1230 for hosting and power 24/7 for the 6 months.

Would you like to be one of the 17? See my reply to todu.

Fanaticism is generally a bad thing, but that includes being fanatically anti-fanatic. It's a fallacy to assume that just because somebody is wrong about one subject (religion) that they can't be right about another (bitcoin/btc-mining).

I thought you said it was in French. \*Québécois slam\*

If we can get 17 people to make the same pledge, I'll buy an S2 and get it running for 6 months and we can share the profits (see: losses)

FTFY. 
On a side note: I was just wondering the same thing about "lost" coins the other day. $1 verify

Thanks for creating those threads. It's a shame that having honest and open discussion has become practically impossible.
Having reread your thread, I'm curious how you came to the conclusion that "Segwit is CLEARLY the better option". In the end, only two arguments remained. 1) The dev team is larger and 2) it fixes the malleability issue. The first isn't an argument for as much as it is an argument against the other option.
Not that this should matter, but I feel I'll be downvoted into oblivion if I don't say it. I think segwit is a good idea, but the core team made an absolute mess of things by not pushing a quick fix for the issue we are facing right now before moving on to the "elegant solution" of segwit.

Does SegWit change the way signatures are calculated too? Because otherwise, how does separating the signature from the data used the generate it prevent transaction malleability, since you would still be able to create collisions?
u/smidge, one bit of feedback on the graphic. When I read


I completely missed the mention of BIP 68 &amp; 112, so I thought that was referring to SegWit and libsecp256k1 and I was very confused.
