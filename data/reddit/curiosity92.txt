don't put all your eggs in one basket I say. I have mine split with 50% bitcoin and 50% alts, you will be a winner regardless what goes up and what goes down. Competition is good as it brings more confidence in the market, more companies join ultimately increasing the overall value.

despite what everyone says with transaction fees I don't think the last bitcoin will be ever fully mined, it will continue to half however there will be a change in the code to allow halving beyond  0.00000001. That would mean we could never outrightly mine total 21000000 bitcoins but rather slowly approach it.   We could have further halvings at 0.000000005, 0.0000000025, 0.00000000125

hahahaha, i did the exact same thing and the price dropped. I am also going to buy tomorrow as well.

nah you must be a bit off here, i did an excel sheet as well back in October and was within range. $100000 in 2020 seems more correct. happy to share my excel sheet to compare

I have faith that by 2030 we will hit at-least 20million
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:39:24
it will hit $60000 but will retreat to $40-50k

it's no different to what we have now and we are not increasing the number of bitcoins. It's breaking it into even smaller parts

The long term effect more companies will follow suit like vias/mastercard and big banks in each country whereby the average person won't be able to buy a bitcoin to reduce reliance on their deflationary currency.   This is exactly every government's motive is at the moment. But at the same time, corporations will use it to their benefit, though it won't be on the open web but on the deep web to further increase the difficulty.

nice, I sold at 9k after the big dump (small loss though)  bought back at 5k after convincing myself 4k was the bottom. I'm a FOMO person, I'm looking to buy 1 more for cold storage waiting for the pull back soon

damn, I remember when I was in highschool we were talking about wiki leaks and assange in either 2009/2010 and the donations they were getting. Faintly remember bitcoin being spoken off but none of us fully understood it let alone obtain it.
