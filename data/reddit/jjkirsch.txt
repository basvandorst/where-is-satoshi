So good words. I have read it with pleasure actually. I can only as that btc is my future, btc is our future!

I don't know about Singapore or Hong Kong. As Bitcoin grows it will increasingly pose a threat to fiat. I would expect the governments there to be less accommodating in the future.
Tokyo is interesting because they thrive in the technology sector. Bitcoin will bring a lot of new, lucrative business to the city.

They have nothing to say until bankruptcy procedure will be completed, nothing surprising

I think that transaction time is a crictical issue that must be solved

The Triad mafia based in Hong Kong's wet dream. When they see this video, they will realize some of their problems are solved lol.

A very basic way to set up a voting system would be to log IPs to the DB that have voted and only allow them to vote once. Most of the time this is sufficient, but if you make a member's area and allow members to vote only once and you have to be logged in to vote, then you're good to go. Also, be sure to check your boundaries. Be sure people can't edit any JS you might use and change how many stars they give or do other garbage.

I think the CIA have vest interested in bitcoin, if anything, the craziest theory was that it would eventually lead to having SHA -256 cracked. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:32:40
Very strange way to promote btc doing like this, this guy looks ridiculous
@_date: 2014-08-04 11:40:06
Anyhow, through BTC we found that the random generation is a MAJOR factor when it comes to generating the asymmetric keys.
@_date: 2014-08-25 05:58:57
It's all about infrastructure.
Once the infrastructure is in place for retailers to easily receive the payment and for consumers to pay with BTC the two parties of the transaction will join in the happy BTC dance! I look forward to seeing it mature. 
It would be great to have a BTC debit card that links to whatever address I select - like Coin but with a BTC option.
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:05:59
True, but I also make deals with the guys with good reputatuon from another one forum about bitcoin. They have a rate of reputatuon so you can make a deal with someone overseas and be sure about it 
@_date: 2014-07-13 12:13:27
That's a good argument, in case you're right.
@_date: 2014-07-28 04:41:15
I think what franky1 was saying is that these sites can't monitor the entire bitcoin network, they can only monitor a very small amount of listening nodes so you're not getting the full picture. Additionally these sites can't easily monitor nodes that don't listen (unless those nodes happen to connect to them) which is about 95% of them.
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:37:11
Holy shit! You guys can't be fucking serious....can you?? I sure hope not at least!

I won't be surpirsed to find out some people in Hollywood start making a movie about MtGox anytime soon.

Nope, haven never  think about Yahoo being dead! It's cool and it is my favorite mail.
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:02:17
great news. now that will help push those small independant retailers to accept bitcoin, because they can restock their shelves with dell computers and pay dell with bitcoins, without converting
we need more suppliers to do this
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:01:01
These machines will spread word about BTC more than the people using them..
@_date: 2014-09-14 21:28:03
Annual remittances from the US to Mexico amounts in 10s of billions of $$$. Even if just 1% is done using BTC, the value can skyrocket.

MIT is too overrated on just about everything. And global laming warming is a scam on epic proportion.

Whatever the origins of the OP, thanks for the news, there are some sites  I haven't checked out yet.
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:55:19
Well, better late than never. 
I have been using it for a long time. I remember once it took a month to get money from overseas

Did St. Peterburg have a choice?
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:31:52
WOw! Seriously? Can't believe that someone bet on it cause the forecast doesn't seem that BTC will reach 10K

I always wanted to use BTC to pay for iTunes! great news!
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:21:42
Thats' a good idea! That could be our future, our nearest future! But to make it come true we must solve the problems of nodes.
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:00:11
Only in theory.
It is highly unlikely speculators have access to other traders position to force a margin call. And even if they do, they can not possibly know the full cost of pushing down price certain level and at what price they need to buy to recoup the expense.
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:27:03
This article is retarded.  Demand for bitcoin can never go unmet because it's divisible. Duhh. It just deflates (appreciates) in value.  there is no need for central banks or for fractional reserves.
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:00:45
even if they define bitcoin as money, it would be hard to tax it for peer to peer, they just better focus on businesses.   But if a bueiness is overseas or is using an off shore bank account they wont be able to tax it either.
@_date: 2014-08-25 05:58:05
There was a topic about this already I guess.
Isn't this the wrong section?
This theory is just bad. It's like someone didn't even try too much, just tried spreading some FUD.

Myth: Bitcoins stored locally are less safe than those on exchange wallets.

15 btc, it was for online game money, but I will learn this lesson for sure!
@_date: 2014-07-28 04:41:20
I'd say 40% is about accurate. This is mostly due to the low cost of VPS/Dedi servers in the US compared to the rest of the world. I have 6 nodes in the US for this reason.

I doubt any currency will ever be a one world currency but it has the potential to be a widespread currency and possibly even a reserve currency. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:31:33
The article doesn't clarify if it will be a real crypto like those we have on this forum, similar to bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-28 04:41:25
About the 2 million IP's, keep in mind that figure includes recycled IP's, if you're on a dynamic IP it'll keep changing and you'll keep adding onto that. It's not easy to tell exactly how many unique nodes there are. One node could have many IP's or it's IP could regularly change.

i agree contracts can be powerful tools. yet the way EVERYONE explains it seems very wishy-washy,

There was no official statement, their twitter account looks untouched, no tweets at all. How can they do it?!
