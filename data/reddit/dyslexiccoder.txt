Actually there is. Keeping the public key hidden is absolutely crucial in protecting the network against any flaws in elliptic curve cryptography.
If a flaw was found that allowed an attacker to derive a private key from a public key and everyone's public keys were known then Bitcoin would be completely compromised. It would be trivial for anyone to spend anyone else's funds. With Satoshi's implementation of hashing the public keys, as long as you follow best practices and use a new address for each payment the same vulnerability would have basically no impact.
Assuming it would take a few hours for an attacker to derive the private keys you could continue to make transactions knowing they would be mined before anyone has the chance to derive your private keys. Even if attackers could derive the keys much quicker, users would be able to protect their funds by not making payments until Bitcoin get's updated.

I'm not saying it's likely to happen any time soon, just saying your statement that "There is no point in protecting public key" is not true. It's not a one way cipher, it's totally possibly that it could be reversed. It's incredibly easy and cheap to protect against this via hashing so it would be pretty silly not to.


If a flaw was found it's unlikely key derivation would be trivial, just more feasible than it is currently. For example if a much more efficient DLog algorithm was discovered it might be possible to derive keys in "a few hours" like I previously mentioned.


I'm not quite sure what you mean about moving to fresh wallets, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. As long as you haven't reused addresses in the past then you wouldn't need to do anything to remain protected.

Yes, like all software in existence Bitcoin has had bugs in the past and there are almost certainly more bugs that are yet to be discovered.
Most of the previously discovered bugs were fairly small but there have been some pretty bad ones. Most are just DoS attack vectors against Bitcoin nodes, however other exploits allowed people to create Bitcoin out of thin air ([CVE-2010-5139]( or even spend other peoples coins ([CVE-2010-5141](

About being able to derive ECDSA keys from RNG source + public key + signature?

It's pretty simple, just keep generating addresses until you find the prefix you want. This will do it in Node.js:
    const bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib');
    
    while (true) {
        const keyPair = bitcoin.ECPair.makeRandom();
        const {address} = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPair.publicKey});
    
        if (address.startsWith('1andreas')) {
                console.log(address);
                console.log(keyPair.toWIF());
                break;
        }

Built on the brilliant  API, with a simple algorithm to derive bias from user influence across cryptocurrency communities.
There are lots of people voicing their opinions on Crypto Twitter, however it's often hard to work out if Tweets are genuinely informative, or if the person has an ulterior motive.
This browser extension helps you get quick insights into user biases.
Bias information is displayed inside the users profile card that pops up when you hover over their avatar.
It's also displayed under a users bio on their profile.
The data isn't perfect, there's definitely ways I can improve it. But I think it's accurate enough to be helpful.
It's 100% open source like all of my work. If you don't trust my releases with your precious Twitter session, that's ok, you don't have to!
You can build the extension from source yourself and load it into Firefox/Chrome locally. Build instructions are on GitHub.
Also, a little bit about me, I've been working full time on open source software since 2016. I work for free, and fund myself by cutting down my living costs and doing occasional freelance work to keep myself afloat.

I would never suggest someone store a serious amount of money in a custodial wallet like tippin.me.
But I think they are great for things like tipping, just like reddit tip bots are also custodial.
Have you tried tippin.me? The UX is incredible. It's tightly integrated with Twitter, you can go to their site and be up and running on LN in literally under a minute.
They also have a cool Chrome extension that injects a tip button to all Tweets. So you can tip a Tweet via LN and the recipient gets a notification about which Tweet they received the tip for.
* Is it good for privacy? No.
* Is it good for censorship resistance? No.
* Is it good for economic sovereignty? No.
Is it a cool little tool to raise awareness of LN and help onboard and give new users a little taste who wouldn't otherwise be able to? Yes.
LN is amazing but it's not ready for the average user yet. If custodial services can bridge the gap in the meantime, I see no problem with that.

For more info and for those that don't want to click through to twitter:
Demo video: 
When you enter your seed phrase to recover a new wallet, the Coinomi app makes a request to Google's spellcheck api to spellcheck the seed phrase. Yup, I know. The plain text seed phrase is accessible to Google (although transport uses SSL so it's encrypted over the wire). However this does mean that if you're using Coinomi your seed phrase is likely sitting in plain text logfiles at Google, accessible to a large number of employees.
I'd recommend if you use Coinomi wallet to immediately move all of your funds to a different wallet. I'd suggest something open source and well known or ideally a hardware wallet.
Full credit goes to  for finding the vuln. He's also claimed he's lost about $70k of funds from his wallet and Coinomi are avoiding the question of whether they'll reimburse him. This is why he's now decided to go public.

Yep, and to make it more bizarre, just the fact that a seed contains only the words from the BIP39 wordlist, doesn't mean it's a valid seed.

Brute forcing a private key gives an attacker access to a single address.
Brute forcing a seed gives an attacker access to all private keys for all addresses for all accounts for all cryptocurrencies derived from that seed.
The expected reward for successfully brute forcing a seed is much higher.
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:58:43


Which the **seed** key space is, so it's harder to brute force a 24 words **seed** than a 12 word **seed**.
A private key is still a private, it's still the same difficulty to brute force a single private key no matter what entropy your seed phrase is.
But to brute force the **seed**, which is much worse because it would give an attacker access to all of your private keys, is harder the more entropy you have.
What you're saying would make sense if a mnemonic only derived a single address (single private key). But it doesn't, it derives multiple addresses (multiple private keys).
The relevant key space to attack in the context of brute forcing a seed is 512 bits, not 128 bits.
@_date: 2019-04-29 13:04:41
Yeah you're right, I clarify all these points in the readme: 
@_date: 2019-04-30 04:38:02
Yeah, I guess it depends on whether you interpret "just as safe" to mean "equally as safe" or "just as likely to be broken in the near future".
Just trying to clarify to make sure people don't misunderstand.
@_date: 2019-04-30 11:33:54
You're thinking about it backwards, you don't "encode the seed with words".
You generate entropy, that entropy can be expressed as a mnemonic phrase, the higher the entropy the more words you need to express it as a mnemonic.
128 bits of entropy needs 12 words, 256 bits of entropy needs 24 words.
Neither of those values are the actual seed, they are the entropy and the mnemonic phrase.
When you import your mnemonic phrase into a wallet, it derives your seed from the phrase. This seed is 512 bits.
For each private key for each account is derived from this seed which is 256 bits.
@_date: 2019-04-30 10:00:15
You're confusing a private key and a BIP39 seed. And also the difference between size/security/entropy all measured in bits.
A single private key is always 256 bits in size (128 bits of security).
A BIP39 seed is always 512 bits in size (can vary in entropy).
BIP39 seeds can have different amounts of entropy, 128 bits for 12 words or 256 bits for 24 words, but they are always 512 bits in length.
@_date: 2019-04-29 14:37:28
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:10:25


They aren't just as safe, the comment you linked to says a 12-word seed is "ok", not that it's equivalent to 24-words:










A single private key is 128 bits.
A 12-word seed that can derive all of your private keys is 128 bits.
A 24-word seed that can derive all of your private keys is 256 bits.
By using a 12-word seed it means an attacker able to break 128 bits can steal your entire wallet funds. With 24-word seed the same attacker would only have enough resources to steal funds from a single address.
It also increases the amount the can expect to profit from an attack (they get the entire wallet not a single address) so can justify spending more resources on it.
I understand what you mean, at the rate of current technology both 128 bits and 256 bits are considered unbreakable for the foreseeable future, a 12-word seed is definitely not insecure. But saying they are "just as safe" is incorrect.
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:50:13
You're confusing length (key space) and entropy again.
The length is 512 bits. The entropy is 128 bits (assuming 12 words).
You only need to brute force the 128 bits of entropy to get every possible 12 word seed, not the full 512 bit key space.
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:28:06
Yes, that's what I've said multiple times and completely contradicts what you've been saying.
12 words = 128 bits of entropy.
24 words = 256 bits of entropy.
Both are hashed into a 512 bit seed. That doesn't change the entropy.
24 words is more secure that 12 words due to he higher entropy, it takes longer to brute force 128 bits than to brute force 256 bits.
The fact they are hashed into 512 bits is irrelevant.

@_date: 2017-09-28 09:09:08
The thing is that's completely irrelevant, I haven't once stated people's wallets are getting "hacked" (whatever that means), the issue is they're leaking all their users addresses in plain text over the internet every time they open the app.
They're avoiding commenting on anything to do with the actual issue.
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:07:15
I would argue that in that case this is still a valid vulnerability. Stepping down non SSL traffic to a non SSL server may be ok in some scenarios, for example a brochure website, but not for a financial application. That completely defeats the purpose of SSL.
It means I can still run a MITM attack. Electrum servers should not accept non SSL traffic.
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:18:42
Yeah, but these are all Coinomi's own private Electrum servers which are hardcoded into the app. None of which are using SSL.
I create the issue over a week ago and have reached out to them on Twitter but had no reply. Now I'm posting it here to hopefully pressure them into actually doing something.
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:14:12
Somebody already has: 
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:59:01
Well they're using electrum servers which means that your private keys are kept on your device. So there's little chance your keys will be stolen. It does however mean that anyone on the same WiFi network as you can see all the communication between you and the electrum servers.
This has privacy issues, meaning I can view all of your addresses and see how many coins you have, which addresses you're sending them to and which addresses you received them from.
It could also potentially open you up to a replay attack. e.g I ask you to pay me 1 BTC. I run a man in the middle attack meaning all your requests go through a computer I control before getting to Coinomi (this is possible because they aren't using SSL). I can then choose to stop the payment getting through. I say, I didn't get the payment. You can verify on the blockchain and in your client that the payment really hasn't gone through. You send it again and I receive the payment. Then at a later date I can re-send the original payment I captured which is still a valid transaction and I will receive another payment of 1BTC.
The main issue though is that this is a very basic security feature that should be enabled by default. The fact that they haven't enabled SSL (it's supported by default in electrum, all you have to do is generate a certificate) and that they have been ignoring my questions about it should raise questions about their competence and what other vulnerabilities may exist in their code.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:05:21
Agreed. "They're definitely not requiring SSL" would've been more accurate.
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:21:03

This is the source code hardcoding all their electrum servers: 
They're definitely not using SSL because you can pick any one and connect to them via fucking telnet ��

I'll paste my findings here from the GitHub issue in case it gets taken down. Please go thumbsup the issue on GitHub to put more pressure on Coinomi to fix this.
Ok, so dug into this a little bit further, I monitored all network traffic while opening the Coinomi app on my phone. I did a search on the captured packets for `6a 73 6f 6e 72 70 63` which is `jsonrpc` in hex. It ended matching a packet, you can see the match on line 0030:

So basically opening the Coinomi app is broadcasting all of my Bitcoin addresses in plain text over the network.
This is a major privacy issue and needs addressing. ElectrumX supports SSL out of the box, all Coinomi need to do is generate a certificate.
pcap file for anyone who wants to look at the network activity for themselves: [coinomi_plaintext.pcap.zip](
**TLDR: Opening the Coinomi app leaks all of your Bitcoin addresses over the internet in plain text.**
**Edit: They've now locked the GitHub issue and are deleting comments:** 
**Double Edit: They've also now blocked me on twitter:**

That link doesn't work for me. I took snapshots on archive.org when it was all kicking off:

Wow, that's an awesome idea.

I did initially have it sorted by "difference", but I found I kept having to scroll all over the place to find the currencies I was interested in.
Sorting by market cap is a familiar order so I found I could locate currencies much easier.
I the columns sortable though so if it bothers you, you can sort by "difference".

Definitely. If we're bringing computation power into the equation then deriving the seed from the mnemonic will be the most intensive part.
BIP39 requires 2,048 rounds of HMAC-SHA512 (4,096 SHA512 hashes) to derive the seed from the mnemonic. And that's required before you can even start deriving addresses and looking up balances.
So that's 4,096 SHA512 hashes + address derivation + balance lookup for 1 guess!
So it would probably be somewhere in the region of \~4,000 times faster to skip a mnemonic with an invalid checksum than to go through address derivation.

Web developer calling in here, nice idea.
By the way, you've missed the closing H2 tag off the sub heading:
