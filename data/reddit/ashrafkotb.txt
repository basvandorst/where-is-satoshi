Good strategy, although I would prefer going in lots rather than DCA. I believe, however, that the bear market will end soon. The market price momentum and volume are showing Bitcoin going into a wedge, which I expect will break during Sept/Oct to reach another ATH by December before the next bearish cycle. This is what has exactly happened last year between October and December.

I'm quite sure that the below can help someone who has time to complete the puzzle and look for more relationships, also worth looking at the \(Qs\). Chose the nearest word with the same font size, and excluded the verb tenses or adjectives that we normally don't see in seeds! Might not be accurate, or might not be working at all but worth a try!
z=0		Order
z=1		Tie / Free
z=2		Suffers
z=3		Routine
z=4		Anonymous
z=5		Sent
z=6		Cutting
z=7		Flow
z=8		Leave
z=9		Current
z=10	Given
z=11	Agree \(Might be Next as well\)
z=24	Drop / Express
z=25	Stock / Services
z=30	Internet
z=35	Uncertainties
z=40 	Exists
z=41	Thin
z=45	Hardware
Follow Zs and Qs, and possibly some other equations in the image, they are there for a reason for sure.
