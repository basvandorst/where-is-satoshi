sounds nice but it does not change the fact that i do not like nestle because they plan to privatize water from all over the world

a small correction would be enough and the sellorders would go through. that chance for small correction on 10k is big, i hope!

dont get me wrong BUT i think:
1. you should not use the name cryptopia because its the name of an exchange since 2014 in the netherlands
2. you should use a facecam and communicate with your watchers
3. you should not use as many memes as you did in the 3 minutes is watched a video.
4. you should not be bullish on XRP.
5. you should never using Rockets oder to-the-moon Emotes this makes you look unserious
6. ...
7. ...
8. ... if you think about to make money with youtube you should know the youtube algorithm prefers videos with a length of 10 minutes or more
i wish you good luck but all i have seen isnt realy informative, satisfactory or anything new. you will have no chance among all the others if you do not add a personal note or at least are realy good in your chart analytics, but all i've seen in your Video "Long term Bitcoin Investing", "Are Altcoins dying?...." is the same as others like cryptozombie or another whose name i would not like to call here.
*\*\*I'm sorry if I'm too direct but I've always been that way but it's better someone is telling you now than if you're doing tons of work and wondering why nothing happens and nobody watches your videos.*

Sure you can do it that way if you are a HODLer but I would like to increase my number of BTC by trading on a exchange.
Started trading with \~300$ (\~0,09BTC) playmoney about 2 years ago. while learning to trade i lost about 50% in just 4 weeks. reading indicators and chartanalytics was something new for me but i was interested in the whole crypto and trading szene. After some research, reading books, watching videos etc. im proud to say i am the owner of 1,88 BTC - all started with 300$. (inkl. all payed taxes and fees)
