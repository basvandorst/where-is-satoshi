Obviously you have not seen "The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin".  It's a good flick, I suggest it.  At one point in the film, the Bitcoiners go to a Libertarian convention.  They are humored by the signs that say "End the Fed".  They respond by saying something along the lines of "End the Fed?  More like TranscEND the FED!"
Pro Tip:  Try not to come off so abrasive and condescending.  You do a disservice not only to yourself, but also to the ideas you represent.  You'll catch more flies with honey.

Think whatever you want.  I don't even know how to use Photoshop, nor do I even own the program.  MS Paint is the extent of my knowledge.
