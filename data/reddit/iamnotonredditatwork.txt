It certainly has the potential to be a quite useful currency some day way out in the future. In it's current state though I feel like it's price is 95% held up by hype/bullshitting, and 5% by the chance of it actually being useful someday.

Instead of dividends you get profits off of forks.

Might as well be. It's not much of a currency at this point.

True, except cyrpto currencies actually have potential to have an actual use some day. That potential was never there for beanie babies or special vhs tapes.

The difference is gold actually has practical uses outside of just being a token of value. It's important in many electronics. 


Bitcoin is in beta! Curb your enthusiasm. Think long term.
I agree. I'm not a bitcoin or crypto hater by any means. Crypto currency is an awesome idea and will almost certainly be quite useful in the future. It's just that in my opinion bitcoins price is massively inflated by hype and misinformation.

There will be very useful crypto currencies in the future. There's no garauntee bitcoin will be it though, and it has absolutely no intrinsic value to fall back on if it's not the best. If there is another technology in the future that does it better there's no reason to use bitcoin over said new coin.
