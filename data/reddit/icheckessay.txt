Yeah, a military coup is not happening anytime soon. (Although i can never rescind some hope that it may happen, but then we're stuck with more of the same 90% of the time)

Yes, that's what most Venezuelans who study Computer Engineering or such do.
Among my classmates i know only a few that don't work for an external company for less than 50$ a  month.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:59:35
i dont think you understand what 4$/month means.
If you have the skillset to be hired for 50$ish a month in a company outside venezuela, you're not going to want to spend those dollars in a vpn.
Honestly, i disagree with a crowdfund campaign being the option, but maybe im just sick of the attitude of some venezuelans where everything has to come to them for free.
PD: Im a venezuelan, i know the problems that most people face, but there's no way we're going to get out of this shithole as a country without fixing the mindfuck this government has made.

Probablemente te vaya mucho mejor si encuentras a alguien que compren $, conozco a varias personas que hacen eso y les llega el dinero por transferencia (Es muy facil encontrarlos en paises tipo panama, pero si estas mas lejos pregunta a otros venezolanos, siempre hay uno que sabe).
Los fees de bitcoin ahorita simplemente no valen la pena.

There are numerous "tip bots" for most of the cryptocurrencies, you can deposit your bitcoins/dogecoins/Robocopcoins ect in this bot and use it on the fly to "tip" an user for a good comment (or for whatever reason you want really) thus giving him some coins from your wallet with these bots which they can then retrieve and either tip someone else or hoard them in their cave until they swim in them*.
You can click on the two links from the bot to learn more, but it really isnt that complicated.
*I dont think you can actually swim in bits.
@_date: 2014-11-18 21:45:04


No, not entirely.
1) someone who paid less gets into the pile and grabs more (early adopters much?)
2) someone who just noticed they were all just throwing their money in a pile decided he wanted to get his money back, so he goes to get as much of it back as possible.
once the money pile starts getting smaller more and more people try to get theirs out of desperation.
I mean, even if you disagree with the analogy, you're being intentionally dumb here.


they're called opinions, you are entitled to yours, and he is entitled to his.
I for one, am happy to watch from an spectator seat how this all comes out, if it turns out bitcoin solves literally everything, cool, if it doesnt, oh well, but calling anyone who disagrees with you a person who "doesnt understand bitcoin" is on par with most of the circlejerk subs.

You're assuming the dollar getting massive inflation and a great portion of the people knowing and being "good" enough at computers to get bitcoin.

The thing is, RT is just as biased (or worse) than most western media, but because it's confirming your view points you just ignore it. The strategy for these sites is just saying everything "bad" or "good" about something while completely omitting any context.
Hell, if you listened to RT, Venezuela is a fucking paradise.

I dont even have to open that link to see that it is the same socialism BS that's all my "edgy" friends try to parade around facebook.
So, let's go with the chair based explanation:
When you make a chair, the chair wasn't made out of nothingness, there had to be wood, and the person who chopped that wood needed to be paid so does the guy who made the axe, and the guy who delivered the wood. Once these guys are paid, you need to pay the person who will deliver the chair, and (if applicable) the persons who market the chair, and even in some cases some people to track all of these people and get them together. Now, since this is not doable in a grand scale for a single person, you need managers ("Evil music plays") Sometimes the scale goes so big you need persons to manage these persons ("Evil Music plays again").
Now, i dont need to tell you that the people who are skilled enough to manage the managers of the managers in a way that everything goes fine need a pay too, and since their job involves more than putting part A into part B for a few hours on end, they want to be paid more.
Now, you got a whole emporium of chair makers, good for you, but who started it? Someone had to buy the first bunch of wood, and hire some people to help him make chairs, then sell those chairs to cover the cost of the wood and what the people were asking for placing slot A into slot B. Surely this guy wanted to make some money, and so he risked his money (and a good chunk of his life in occassions) first into this business, i think he deserves a share of every chair made with his wood, any worker would agree. When he finally gets to having workers make 100000000 chairs for him, he gets a good chunk of money, which most of it is reinvested but you can't expect him to just live off nothingness, he needs chairs too.
TL;DR: Inversion value, worker demand, etc.
Also, nobody is using force to get these workers in there, there's actually laws against that.
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:22:10
I think you're confusing cause and effect.
Capital controls are the most retarded option possible when your currency is losing value, which is also why they're applied in countries that are retarded enough to cause the economic downfall in the first place.
(Venezuelan here, saying that anything our government does is "standard operating procedure" is simply retarded, about argentina, they're literally copying our government so not much surprise there.)

How does Bitcoin have more use than gold?

Oh... Sorry, is the internet a bad thing? How about Industralization? Iron Processing? 99% of the achievements throughout history have been made without this "Freedom" you speak off. Organization has proven to be way more efficient than total freedoom.
Of course, i imagine Freedom still has Fire and maybe some spears or hunting weapons with it. Still quite a big exageration.
To reiterate, i don't mean we should all give up our freedoms because reasons, i'm saying that like everything, freedom is a gradient and if you take it to either extreme you're going to have problems.


I actually had to google the guy, not from USA here.
But yeah, There's a big difference between giving up liberty and giving up essential liberty. I would say giving up the liberty to freely trade drugs in order to avoid someone getting killed is a pretty good tradeoff.

if you think one part is overfunded or underfunded right now, imagine what would happen if it became a popularity contest between institutions to receive tax money (Decreasing efficiency). Not to mention the thousands of categories there'd have to be to effectively cover everything. with the current public in the USA, welfare would be the first to go.

When you need to import almost everything to produce (Because as i said in another post a bunch of stuff got taken by the government "for the people" and then left for rot) then you need to get dollars to import, when you cant get dollars, you're kinda screwed.

@_date: 2014-09-26 21:42:45
The thing you all dont realize is, however bad you guys have it in the USA, there are places much worse (AKA, you actually got a pretty good deal going).
Think Venezuela, 63% inflation within a year, crime rates are just through the roof with the 2nd highest murder per capita in the world, dollars are restricted and everything is corrupted to hell (to the point where you dont really need "leaks" to see it) not to mention our government acting like cuba's puppet state.
In Venezuela, a good 50% of the population actually agree with the government, and less than 20% are protesting about it.
What im saying is, for people to go out on mass protests, it takes a LOT more than you think.

@_date: 2014-09-25 02:52:07


Honestly, this part is what's missing the most, opening up a wallet on bitcoin.org (iirc, the first site that is on google) it's basically a choice on downloading 20 GB of data or using sites that the own bitcoin site throws way too many warnings at.
Sure, once you find online wallets then it all changes, but people will ask, what's the difference between this and my bank, why should i use this?
I dont think an hyperinflation event is coming anytime soon, call me naive, but i trust that the USA's government is not THAT incompetent to make people literally want to move away from USD in hordes, so waiting for such an event to happen to step your game up is out of the question
TL;DR: Just random ramblings really.

Im not a libertarian, i consider the government to be very usefull in a number of ways (while inefficient in others of course) but ultimately necessary.
I personally believe border control to be necessary in order to stop the culture from a certain place from being completely destroyed. And by culture i mean the general status quo of a population.
My opinion is probably affected by the fact that i live in a third world country where every family has someone who's been robbed if they're lucky, and murdered if they were not. I'd have a hard time believing these are the kind of people who wouldnt move to a first world country just to have an "easier life". And i honestly wouldnt wish that upon anyone.

To be fair, the quote is mainly an opinion (That may or may not be shared by other people, hint: It's the circlejerk here).
The opinion holds no ground because:
1) Doesnt provide any evidence.
2) Doesnt come out of any recognized authorities on the subject.
3) Claims some of the best economists in the world to not know what they're doing while they manage one of the strongest economies in the world via a strawman (Printing money for their rich pals).
He's right in attaching the messenger, although it doesnt make the argument false by default, it does discredit the "coming out of a recognized authority" part.

What im saying is, if you have a bank account, you can already make payments via credit card or bank transfer instead of going to the office directly. You go to the office ONCE (1) and fill the paperwork neccesary, then do the transfers via bank account or credit card, once you've done the paperwork that says you're sending money to X from Y bank or Z card you can't chargeback (They have proof you meant to do it).
Now, what you're proposing is simply replacing this with bitcoin somehow? it seems like it just adds an additional 4th party in there, as you need to coordinate with exchanges and hope to sell the bitcoins for as much as the price as the sender bought them from. either way, the sender ends up paying much higher fees thanks to the buying/selling of bitcoins.
It seems you missunderstood what i wrote, if the sender has a bank account or credit card there are EASIER methods than working through bitcoin (namely bank transfers and credit cards) that do EXACTLY the same as you're proposing.

How is that the main  reason for anyone that isnt a libertarian?
I cant recall the last time someone said "oh man, i hate having to use cash, it's censoring my true motives" (i had to write that several times because everything didnt even sound natural).
A pretty good percentage of people dont give a shit about central banks or being "censored" (whatever that's supposed to mean). but lower the costs for something and suddenly you got their attention.

I hope you do not take this the wrong way, but i live in a third world country (not any third world country, freaking venezuela) so the idea of even thinking the dollar is volatile just makes me laugh incontrollably.
There are plenty of people that will support bitcoin the way it is, but it is still a long way to go before it's anything near universal, and i consider that stability is one of the goals that needs to be met before that happens. Although, hearing about the Circle thing, it does seem to be a good step in the right direction.
Anything that happens, it'll be a good show to watch in the following years.
@_date: 2014-10-03 03:24:24

@_date: 2014-10-25 06:59:28
No, it can't.
Same reason as Venezuela, nobody's going to sell their "precious" bitcoins for unstable, inflationary currency unless they get much more of said unstable currency than converting to USD and dealing with USD.
Basically, you end with very few sellers that will sell VERY overpriced coins. These coins are then wasted because places like Argentina arent precisely the pinnacle of innovation (if 30% inflation didnt tip you on that) so the only things they are usefull for is trading for actual USD, which has general value in the world and is VERY stable relative to our currency.
Surely, a small community can form, but it'll never be any close to "convenient" in a third world country if it isnt at least close to the USD in "popularity".
PD: The reason for few real state transactions is not the lack of USD, is the lack of a stable currency or good inversions, making real state one of the best ways to "save" and invest your money.
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:19:04

Yes, there are actually several rates, 6.35 Bs F is the old CADIVI rate which iirc, you can get for importing medicines and some special products, there's the SICAD (I? II? I cant fucking remember) rate which is 10 Bs, which you can get for traveling and you get for internet purchases (amount depends on where you're going if for traveling and for internet is 300$ a year) and then there's SICAD III which you place bids for at certain times of the year and the government basically hand picks who gets it and who doesnt (no, you didnt missunderstanding, the highest bid DOESNT get the dollars, the bids around a certain value do.)

Nothing would ever get done, have you ever worked with said public?


This is just the biggest lie you'll ever tell. Why do you think the 1% exist, because they're all corrupt? let me open your eyes a bit, they have money because they own the production, not because they own the currency.
Apple wouldnt suddenly bankrupt in an hypothethical bitcoin economy, it's hard to see any big companies that would be hit hard.
In fact, i believe we would actually have a few people becoming part of "the 1%" just for being an early adopter.
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:15:17
wouldnt this become a legal problem?
if bitcoin isnt recognized as a currency, then he's technically working for free and being paid in commodities, which i'd assume is illegal (would be basically slavery).
I'd advice anyone to avoid getting paid in bitcoins in the present, opens up a massive legal can of worms (Would you even have to pay taxes on it? if caught not paying taxes this would be a good case of tax avoidance). Plus as much as you believe in bitcoin, having the stability of dollars is a pretty good benefit.
OP, if you're reading this, please think this throughly before doing it, is it really worth it?.
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:13:41


This is where your plans fall off, if you got no bank account or credit/debit card to give the money to WU online (which im guessing can be done already) then how are you getting the bitcoins?
If you can get bitcoins, why wouldnt you use the same payment service that you're using for bitcoins with WU?
now, you can mention localbitcoins, but is it really better to give X guy some cash for bitcoins and then send those to WU than to just go to WU directly?


The thing is, paying by credit doesnt mean you dont fill any forms, you still need to fill them (Im not aware of the specifics, but i'll jump and say that you need to get your account verified first before making payments via credit card) and those forms are used for fraud prevention anyway. These forms are EXACTLY the same you would have to sign with bitcoin, due to banking regulations not changing magically, so there's no real benefit in there.
Ill concede that there may be a little less fraud with bitcoin since you can't just chargeback, but apart from that i dont see any other real benefit to doing this.
TL;DR: You need a bank account to get bitcoins (and thus are not part of their main market which is UNBANKED people), not enough benefit over credit cards and bank transfers to make it worth it.
@_date: 2014-10-30 00:03:25
Basically Josh, is it true that you cannot "technically" ban bitcoin. But i think you'd agree that banning it's use as a currency is not really that far from it.
if bitcoin cant be used by any business or any big seller, then it's essentially banning bitcoin.
The analogy is not true because while you can't ban people from accepting gravity, or being influenced by it, you CAN ban business from accepting bitcoin.

well, i guess you could always sell them somewhere else, but there are people who will deposit into your bank account in USA or Europe or whatever with the dollars, so again, not really that much of an issue to move the dollars.
The problem with BTC in venezuela is that there is very few people who want bolivares and thus other currencies are overvalued, BTC is not an exception and due to it's little community it is MORE expensive to buy BTC with bolivares than to buy dollars and THEN buy BTC with those dollars.
@_date: 2015-01-24 07:15:02


You simply can't.
which is why localbitcoins or any other site will have the dollar even more expensive per bolivar than the black market for dollars.
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:55:27


Yep, and there's a reason they cost about 10x what they would cost in BLACK market dollars.

Not worthless (yet), while we can't freely trade to and from other currencies, the government does give a "stipend" of currency you can buy at the "official" rate ( of course up to 15 times lower than black market), you can get up to 300$ for internet purchases and depending on your destination you can take up to 2000$ iirc for purchases.


Now first of all, traveling is also a problem, right now it is VERY VERY expensive to find a plane ticket because the government promised the airlines to pay them for their bs at the official rate of USD and of course didnt pay, so a lot of airlines plainly left or heavily reduced flights to reduce costs.
About taking cash and trading there, sure, you could do it, but why would you want Bs outside of Venezuela? you can probably find someone willing to sell Dollars inside Venezuela so it seems like the travel is an unnecesary step.
@_date: 2015-01-24 07:12:05

that should be able to cover it for 2 years, and then it falls down because you just chased all the money away from the country, GG :D. Not to mention you just sold 6 trillion USD worth of assets in 2 years, that really can't be good for the economy or the worth of said assets.


... Yeah, i could hire a clown to give 1000$ to everyone who buys X and claim administration costs are cheaper than a marketing department, doesnt mean that it's a better idea.
Right now welfare spending is cheaper (and probably better organized and spent) than a basic income, instead of making bs excuses, you should probably think of how your idea could be applied to welfare without being 2x as expensive and not nearly as usefull. 
if 2.4 trillions sounds reasonable to you, you should probably look at the damn budget for your country, googled it since you clearly havent seen it. For this year Obama requested about 3.9 Trillion while the Republicans proposed about 3.1 Trillion, so 2.4 trillion would be either more than half of the federal budget or way more than 2/3rds of it, either way a fuckload of the budget.

Let's say for a moment that you get the 1000+ dollars for the rig somehow, it is better value to just keep buying dollars instead of trying to get into bitcoin.
Also, you're proposing driving to colombia or brazil to pick it up? afaik these countries arent precisely tech havens either, and the drive to brazil would be the most dangerous drive you'd ever do (if there is even a road connecting the places).

Didnt one guy calculate exactly the contrary a few weeks ago?
Basic income of 10.000$ a year for the entire population of the USA (320,064,285 minus people below 20 (because they had stats for that in wikipedia, like 25%) gives us about 240 million peoples)
so 240m x10.000 = 2.400.000.000.000, that's 2.4Trillion dollars a year if i didnt epicly fail at maths (it's pretty late so i probably did, please do correct)
from [here]( i got this quote


so yeah, if we just fired everyone and wired up one machine to magically give everyone in the country 10k a year. it would cost more than double the welfare spending (according to wikipedia).
And im really not sure if i'd like everything classified as welfare spending to be over, certainly many hospitals (clinics? i can't remember which is the name for public one, english is not my main language sorry.) would close and let's just not talk about the logistics of giving everyone 10k a year.
TL;DR: Nope.

Gold is also relatively easy to refine, and it's also usefull in that it doesnt require advanced tech to transport it (since it can't be corroded as easily as iron, doesnt react with other metals unless you somehow manage to get chlorine into it.), hence it was once used as a currency, not sure how being an integral part of your phone and probably computer make gold useless tho.
Im not saying gold is the ultimate store of value, it is most certainly dated, but to call it useless is to ignore half of its properties.

About the 2% number, it was just an example. The point being, whichever that % number is, you don't want all ideas that belong to the less than that number to be ignored, that causes stagnation.
By stagnation i mean lack of liquidity, which stops entrepreneurs and people without big chunks of capital from starting new companies. You stop competition, you stop innovation unless it can happen at an established company already, and you kill any market that doesn't have margins big enough to offset this %. We can all agree this is negative.
The average person is not going to move tomorrow to a deflationary currency, the only known ones right now are crypto and are WAY too complicated and risky for the average person to get into. As an aside to this, just because the average person thinks something better doesn't make it better for them, the average person is retarded economically and will fully take 1000$ now without noticing that will stop their employment in the near future.
As for your ideas of "thinking of ways to deal with it", well, there are none so far that dont include "say fuck you to anything that isnt profitable enough to keep up with the deflationary rate" currently, if you can think of some that dont end up looking like inflation V2 you should propose them in a formal thesis.

uh, there IS a reason to single out bitcoin mining over Google Databases.
Google Databases are efficiently run as to use the minimum energy per byte stored. Bitcoin's energy is used to maintain security, but even this makes it REALLY inefficient, as most of the energy is literally just wasted on calculating meaningless numbers as opposed to storing and transacting with the blockchain.
With that said i dont see a solution to this with bitcoin.

having internet does not mean having food. most internet plans are extremely cheap here (Like, less than 6 eggs worth a month) so it's not really a wonder people have internet.
He probably means a month of minimum salary, which is about 3 dollars a month last i checked.
If you're making Bolivares and dont have some source of income in dollars, things are THAT bad. If you're making dollars, depending on the amount you will be able to pay for food but it'll be hard (not impossible) to find it.
Overall the only food i'd say is easy to find is vegetables, but they're pretty expensive.

The assumption here is that they would work with a majority of the mining pools big enough so that they can spam the network without losing a ridiculous amount of money.
The mining pools benefit from this because increased fees (and literally lose money if they bring BTC down with it for BCH, so that's clearly not the point), but if a % that big of the hashrate wanted the fees to go up they dont need ASICBOOST or a third conspirator anymore, they could literally take over bitcoin at any moment (and make it require a hard fork to work again). 
As you can already see this is boiling to obscure reasons for the parties to even work with each other.
We can either assume those reasons exist and EVERY party has bad intent or we can assume that "More people made transactions as the price was going up and bitcoins was all over the news".


your assumption was implied literally after that.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:54:14
You're massively misunderstanding the stagnation comment. People will still buy things, of course, however deflation highly hurts any innovation.
if you could keep your cash and make it appreciate in real value 2% a year with 0 risk, nobody would invest in something that might turn less of a profit than that (Maybe out of passion, but i think everyone will agree that depending on people's passion to do things is a shitty idea).
In inflationary currencies, holding your cash makes you LOSE real value, so you're pushed to either invest it or at least loan it to others who will.
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:23:12


You missed the point, anyone who had enough money to somehow buy a miner was already well off.


Read the article, he flew to colombia. there are a LOT of people that sell USD in cash or via wire (If you have a bank account outside the country of course) here. All he needed was a bank account outside the country or one person that would accept his USD to fly to colombia in the first place (Where he could exchange them freely).
Hell, he didnt even need USD to fly to colombia, you can buy tickets with Bolivares easily.
