I use Gyft to buy things with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:22:44
What will happen though? Will people be pushed to more anonymous crypto’s like Monero?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:27:35
Yeah that’s true too! Thanks for your input
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:27
The Ledger Nano S is a good investment. Can’t seem to find a Trezor anywhere for less than $160 and you can get 2 Ledger Nano S’s for less than the price of one Trezor

Minnesota. We have a dumb governor so maybe he had something to do with it 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:58:08
!RemindMe 2 months
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:21:40
NO ONE WAS PREPARED ‼️
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:31:37
Yeah I agree!
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:48:46
Not available in my state
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:46:05
If you’re in it for short term gains of USD you’re in it for all the wrong reasons
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:37:37
Whoa! That’s definitely something to consider thinking about. It never crossed my mind that it might violate a few of the amendments. Thank you for bringing this up!
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:17:59
 Just recently starting running a node too. Feels good to be helping

Could be. They are out to make a profit on the USD I believe and that would be a way to do it 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:53:33
Gdax isn't available in all 50 states. I'm from MN and gdax isn't usable in my state for anything other than watching the price go up and down 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:43:08
The fees are terrible ��  someone said to me earlier “why are there fees?? I can send you money via PayPal for no fees at all” 
It’s making Bitcoin look inferior to PayPal to many people.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:56:05
Some states do not support GDAX yet, such as mine. I can’t use GDAX or have a GDAX wallet. So I have to deal with every fee. :p 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:22:42
CoinManager lets you set up time frames to send you notification updates (ex: 1min, 5min, 30min increments etc)
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:26:13
Yeah, true
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:08
From what I’ve researched it is pretty reliable as long as you remember to keep the phrase passcode it gives you when you set it up. And yes I’ve heard it actually accepts more coins than Trezor. I wanted a Trezor personally but it’s price is just crazy right now compared to the Ledger

My mom had the same problem earlier today

My dads old high school friend Doug who’s been helping us invest this past year owns somewhere in the ballpark of $36 million. If you still have contact with those gentlemen stay in touch!! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:07:02
Long term invest
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:21
I got in at 4k and make weekly buys 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:39:49
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:32:46
Not peer-to-peer. No fees. My mom just sent me $500 over PayPal so I could buy her some bitcoin. No fees.
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:23:13
I use the “Cash App” from Square and it is pretty quick 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:38:54
Hell yeah! Love the enthusiasm. I’ve got about .5 bitcoin saved up so far and my goal is to someday own 1 full bitcoin. I can’t afford buying it outright right now so I’m investing weekly payments of what I can afford. I love Bitcoin and believe it is the future!
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:23:55
It takes 8 days to go through but it locks you in at the price you bought it at
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:58:51
I’m having the same issue, just contacted support and waiting for them to get back to me now. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 11:52:50
CashApp is fantastic for buying bitcoin. No fees at all and it’s such a clean layout
@_date: 2019-03-31 08:31:31
You can’t at this point in time, it is something they are working on though. But it’s downright the easiest way to buy bitcoin from a debit card I’ve found, which answered your original question lol
@_date: 2019-03-23 18:51:09
What application u use to mine? I used nicehash for a while but then they changed a bunch of things
@_date: 2019-03-31 06:36:59
CashApp is good — just be sure to pay close attention to their TOS so your account stays in good standing
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:16:00
It varies, sometimes it’s 5-10 mins and other times it can take hours depending on where you are transferring to and from. Also how high prioritized your mining fee is etc. 
I don’t really worry about any of that stuff anymore tho since I use Cash App. I just hit buy and then the Btc is in my wallet instantly lol. I can’t wait until I can transfer my cash app wallet to my cold storage though. That will be awesome.
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:23:31
I still hold true to the belief that the only one you can trust is if you yourself put it on cold storage and you and only you have control of the private keys, but for the easy of purchasing and selling I have found cash app as really convenient. It’s owned by Square Inc (same people who own Twitter) so at least it has a fairly large force behind it. Definitely do research and decide if it’s what you would like :)
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:23:44
I buy through cash app and it’s super easy. Just make sure your password is super strong and you should be good. Cash app allows buying and selling as of now and has stated they will allow transfers in a future update
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:15:56
Use Cash App. You can link your debit card up to it and transfer money from your debit card to the cash app and then buy bitcoin through there
@_date: 2019-03-31 08:36:56
Oh I see. Yeah I read it as you’re trying to buy more bitcoin. I don’t know the answer to your question then! Hope you find your answer! :)
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:18:27
Bank of America?
@_date: 2019-02-21 10:55:36
HODL Especially now that Jack on Twitter is promoting Tippin bitcoin payments on his platform. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:49:03
Oh don’t worry, neither do I. Just something I thought of when pondering what could be an impact of the overall decision.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:01:30
If it’s worth even 15k at some point, you won’t be mad at yourself for throwing in $200 as it just hit $10k
There may be a dip soon. But the market is unpredictable because the new mass of users joining into the economy. I’d say go for it. But I’m just a lonely dude who owns half of a bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:17:30
Maybe got moved while someone was cleaning? I know my mom does that some times 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:53:48
I’ll mine your mom’s Bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:45:25
If it goes down to $7.5k you bet your ass I’m buying more xD just gonna HODL even if it does drop too
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:14:48
Coinbase seems to be pretty stable but who knows
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:10:19
Great idea
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:05:46
Potential loss of net neutrality could lead to govt imposing laws against bitcoin so ISP’s could block crypto currency traffic. Not sure on this one but it’s just a theory 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:02:54
HODL STRONG
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:35:21
If you got in before 10K I’d consider you an early adopter. I’ve just heard 10K was a milestone before some mass adoption 
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:49:21
I use Cash app
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:39:22
Will you have any for the Pixel phones any time soon?
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:26:31
Yes you can! I've done multiple times. I'd screenshot the spot but apparently on Android you can't take screenshots in the app.
