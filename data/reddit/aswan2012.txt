Don't see that on the linked page.

Not your keys, not your crypto.

Plus you get leveraging. Increasing the block size eventually will be multiplicative across lightning etc.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:32:50
Pretty much, unless you have some other guarantee that you'll get it back.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:24:48
If they're paying ~$5 to return the payment why don't they just top up your donataion to about that difference (here it would have saved them $4.74!

Sure, I'm extremely sympathetic to the people who bought crypto on this exchange moments before it was hacked.
A decentralized exchange with some kind of working escrow would definitely go a long way to solving this problem.

What? Why would you close a channel immediately? After an initial wave of channel creation the number of channels you'd need isn't that large (since you can use them many times).
This will reduce the number of txs that happen which should reduce the on-chain fees to an equilibrium.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:40:43
But if over time everyone opens channels isn't the money going to cycle?
 I.e. you may end up never or only very infrequently settling to the block chain.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:20:40
Almost. You could employ the services of a high availability anti-cheat service which can publish the penalty transaction for you (for a fee) if the other side tries to cheat you.
I'd argue that, for the reasons you describe, keeping a large channel open without employing redundant anti-cheat service(s) is a risk.

Your capital gain completes on sale. You put in 1000$ in 2016 and sold half of the bitcoin you got in 2017 then you've completed a 500$ -&gt; XXX$ gain and owe tax (or lose and can offset other gains) on that as pertains to your circumstance.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:54:55
To be clear, they earn BTC not USD!

That's right, they used blockchain technology so each shirt is immutable and forever part of the shirtchain

Cleared a transaction yesterday with 0sat/byte &lt;3 segwit.

This is pretty much my plan, I think the risk of the bottom dropping out before I manage to offload my original purchase is pretty low. Once I've done that I can HODL tight with no fear!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:44:34
That was incredibly sad to read.

I'm finally in the million club!
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:22:38
That seems fucked up. What's your parent's leverage?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:54:53
Yeah the material/pattern of the shirt is the most popular one that they print designs on to.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:06:49
Not if they charge for it!
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:34:52
Yeah? That's cool. And if his mother is bed ridden and otherwise well cared for and wishes she has her iPad from 2016 back so that she can enjoy the myriad of entertainment that it offers?
I don't agree with OPs decision to unilaterally liquidate and use his mother's bitcoin *but* you shouldn't be so quick to denounce other people's assesment of the best way to use the resources available to them when you know none of the particulars.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:35:21
So pragmatically I agree with you, the money is a "waste", if it were me I wouldn't buy myself an iPad unless I had budgeted for a frivolous luxury purchase. 
But you've missed some value here that might make OPs calculus add up. The iPad should hold its value pretty well, so ultimately that expenditure might be largely recovered (allbeit in inflationary fiat). If the user of an iPad receives a new iPad all their apps, games, save files etc will be restored *and* they can get the full use of it because you're not asking them to learn some new paradigm. (I frequently find myself stumped with how to do basic tasks on friends iPhones because I'm not familiar with the paradigm and I'm sure that they experience this in reverse.)

If everyone agrees then there isn't a fork (nobody would mine the old chain)

You predict 16k by Christmas? I've seen 10k by 2018 called optimistic

@_date: 2017-11-24 20:00:59
Well, I'll be a happy man if that happens 
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:57:12
no because the BTC wasn't his at the time of the fork, when it goes into his balance then he'll be able to get coinbase to send some of "their" BTC which is earmarked for him to a different wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:57:14
It comes with risk but I think selling it on localbitcoins will fetch you an above market price pretty consistently (though obviously you need to have enough that somebody wants to buy it)
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:46:41
I bought at &lt;8000 :-)
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:37:33
Why run your own node?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:46:34
I sold half so I could HODL the rest, I believe in BTC, I think it'll be the future so I want to keep my meager holdings ^^
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:29:06
I liked it, I didn't do a lot of trading though.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:16:23
bitstamp at least allows you to have multiple sub-accounts for different investment strategies
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:13:33
If nobody sells the price will increase until we find someone's price.
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:38:30
You are paying interest. It's often described as 0% in real terms because the interest is approximately inflation.
It's a great loan, probably the best terms you'll ever get (especially that you only pay it back when you can and gets written off at 50 years old).
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:13:46
Do you mine BTC directly or do you mine BCH and convert?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:35:26
Hah, I sold half at 2X of buy, I'm enjoying myself just fine :-)
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:14:44
"these are strong hands" love it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:29:14
What? you could buy almost double the BTC back with the capital you gained, how are you worse off than the stressed person?
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:17:55
Seems like this site only takes fiat...
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:47:56


Apparently not.
