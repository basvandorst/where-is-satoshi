Do these not have the highest transaction fees or something?
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:12:21
Well, yeah. A coffee shop is the standard I'd assume.

How does this work exactly? Can you explain it to me as if you were trying to sell us a product, and also what are the guarantees and flaws?

If the vast majority of farm land is owned by whites, who the fuck else do you think is going to be killed on the farm lands?

Just giving the poor guy the benefit of the doubt haha I know I'm reaching hard with that one xD

Probably yeah, but I'm assuming he means it has value because of it's properties and potential industrial applications and not only because it looks pretty. Whereas bitcoin is simply a convenient form of money. The idea of gold being replaced in any form at all is absurd even to the biggest crypto enthusiasts I'm sure. Unless of course we figure a way to turn something as worthless as lead into gold at virtually no cost, or something like that.

My thoughts: Bitcoin on a roller coaster? What is this guy talking about, its been stable as fuck. 10 seconds into the video waiting for something - *click* oh... for fuck sakes

I don't know much about Bitcoin and still really new to it, but from my understanding of it that wouldn't work too well. I think with your method of slowly adding in new Bitcoins would mean that the operating costs of the Bitcoin mining computers would outweigh the worth of the Bitcoin since there would be fewer blocks to mine. But then wouldn't that happen anyway when it gets halved again a couple times? Great, now I'm more confused.

Ye I just used it because it seems to be the most popular currency for exchange rate comparisons.
So if the currency in my country starts to fall down, owning bitcoin is literally the same as owning a stronger foreign currency and should be worth more of my own? Thanks. This was bugging me
