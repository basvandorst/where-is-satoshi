I don't jump from alt to alt. I just added to my long positions and added a few new ones, because I want to diversify more. I still support bitcoin and it's my biggest holding, but you have to be realistic. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:20:24
Is this a bug?
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:49:44
I don't see that happening super fast, liquidity is bouncing back and forth between btc and alt coins. We need some serious bullish news to stop that trend.
I never thought I would have less than 50% in bitcoin of total portfolio, but current market has me let to do that. I don't think I only speak for myself...
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:16:12
For me it was 100% btc first, then added some Eth and utility tokens like OmiseGo and Golem. Then added more specific coins out of the top 100 and now sitting at 40% btc.

Any updates on segwit implementation for coinbase?
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:42:05
Well I've seen many leading figures making the case for a $50k bitcoin end of 2018, I hope it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. It's not even that unlikely if you just look at the past and potential. 
The problem is that there are little chances things go horribly wrong. Also considerable chances things go kinda wrong, which causes the price to stall (like happening now). That makes me believe that a $100k bitcoin this year is a little too ambitious. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:48:55
Probably not, but using cpu/gpu is not going to work anyway. You'd make like $0.20 a day when you mine a few hours with an average computer, while it runs slow. Unless you can justify placing an antminer s9 at your work or college (which you can't), only then it would make sense.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:25:28
Current mempool is giving me an erection right now.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:09:33
Some 2mb blocks were mined by Antpool, ViaBtc and slushpool in the last 12 hours. I can't come up with a reason why they are just doing that now? 
They had the capability to consolidate/batch transactions for a longer time I imagine. Or is this some new innovative way to fill blocks, which requires specific technical skills?
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:07:10
Mempool cleared up considerably since like 10 days ago. I know it's the weekend but it didn't went this low since new years day. Did coinbase finally stop spamming the network or is the tx volume just lower?

In that case you need a whole cartel of people both going long and shorting. Pretty impractical and illegal. They can't just dump via shorting contracts, as I stated they can't liquidate enough and would be better off on exchanges (:

Relax, it's the software. It shows only a certain amount of transaction. The mempool only got more empty, so now the graph is showing the transactions with 1-2 sat/byte fees. 
Do you the 0-1 sat/byte in the graph? No, but there is a ton of them. Once certain amount of the upper layers get eaten they will show up. Not spam (:

With tier 4 on Kraken you can wire large amounts to my knowledge.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:35:12
They are probably too busy upgrading their server to review your deposit. I would be angry too, but you shouldn't be in fear. Kraken is one of the most "regulated" exchanges and you have enough proof to start a legal case if needed. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:47:30
To add to that, you can see the 140-200 sat/byte layer got cleared compared to yesterday. Miners don't include these &lt;50 sat fees anyway so they can't even spam the network.

I hodl as much as I can miss, if I need some fiat I only cash out a tiny amount (preferably during peaks). I also have some savings in cash for large unexpected expenses.
I will try to hodl most of my portfolio (I have several kind of cryptos). Ofcourse I can't look into the future but for I'm still a student so I don't really have the incentive to cash out. I'm okay driving my older car for 3 or more years for large future gains. (:

Last 2 weeks have been pretty painful btc-wise. 3th time below $12k. Looking at the 3 month chart gives some perspective though. Much more upside to come in the upcoming months!

What has the $20k price to do with you calling the top? People said the same at $1k, $3k, $5k and $10k. Yet the price went multiple times higher each time. 
The marketcap is still low compared to all other marketcaps. If crypto is going to take up only 5% of the whole investing marketcap, we are talking about a 5 trillion $ market cap. A big (but smaller than now) fraction of that is going to belong to bitcoin, raising the price to atleast $100k.
Now this isn’t going to happen overnight and only the strongest people are going to persist and realise big profits. Bitcoin might seem like a bubble and easy money machine, yet most people are scared to death and won’t buy in big. They are all going to be reminded in 5 years time when crypto has become an unthinkable part of their life.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:31:10
Got a transcation through overnight at 125 sat/byte. Mempool is about the same right now and will get more empty this day and tomorrow. Take your chance to send $4 btc transactions now it's possible.

In fact 99% of the alts are copies of the btc/eth chain, with some technological improvements on the surface... but yet to be proven in the real world and they have very low adoption/no infrastructure. Bitcoin can and will have the developments any of those other alts have. Except for a few outliers like monero and stellar/ripple, I see amost no other alt coins with real fundamentals and use cases. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:40:05
Hodling for that long but can't hold this dip? What was your plan anyway if you have to cash out now? Not that you didn't made profit, but selling in a huge dip is never the way to go. I'll wake you up probably in a few weeks from now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:01:37
Multiple support levels between where we are and $10.4K (previous low, on Bitfinex). We are staying around the MACD. Volume isn't really there so don't expect anything substantial.

Mining attack is still going on, hashrate for Bcash is going up while profitability for bitcoin is actually a lot higher. While normally only 5% would mine at a loss, that's now 20% and going up last hours.

@_date: 2017-12-26 15:25:00
It's not on purpose, certainly BTC.top isn't purposely mining empty blocks. 
It's a technical reason; it happens when a block gets mined just after the previous block. You can see that there is little time between that block and the last block. I don't remember the specifics of why exactly.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:53:15

The good days of online poker are over, I grinded last years during college  trying to make it. Now invested money from poker in crypto and I’m happy with that.

Really useful in trading and especially in crypto with all its volatility. I still like the game though, I hope a decentralized poker platform will be coming.

I bought in 2013, 2015 and this year in June. Before this year I never hodled for long periods, there was just so much uncertainty back then and less content to learn from and even more FUD. Buying and holding bitcoin is a learning process, which takes time. Before you are in the position that you made such significant gains that no correction scares you, there is always the risk of panic selling.

Use it as a reference experience for future investments. Don't fall into the trap to still buy when prices are skyrocketing as people are doing. It is easier to buy when prices rise and when you only hear success stories. It's harder when prices are dropping and mainstream media is telling you not to buy.

You shouldn't base your research on r/btc as it has become a real cult. R/bitcoin is biased aswell in some way, I don't base my research just on this subreddit, while I'm rooting for bitcoin core to succeed. 
One shouldn't neglect the impact that BCH has though. Take a look at:  
BCH price is being pumped while difficulty goes down this weekend by about 50%, while the btc price is quite stable now under $4300. 
For more than a week till difficulty of bch will readjust profitability of the coin might be greater than bitcoin. A lot of miners care about pure profit and will start mining the BCH chain. A lot of developers like Jimmy Song are pointing this out, this weekend is a really important one.
I'm hoping for btc to keep rising, while bch crashes. In that case btc will surely be more profitable.

If you're in need of money I would sell 50% of your btc in about 2 weeks, when the segwit2x anticipated dip comes. If you want to be super sure you can sell right at $5000.

Btc and bch are just dropping a bit together. Lots of money pumped into alt coins, especially eth at the moment. It's logical bitcoin is stalling. Two weeks ago all alts were down, but bitcoin was up massively. It's a trend to look out for to find your position for both alts and btc.
We've tested 4000 now 5 times this week, everytime found huge support just below.
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:58:57
If you need cash, I would sell only a part. If you are worried about losing the initial investment, cover that up first. 4k$ per btc looks like a lot, but we are still in the very early days of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

Version 2.9 from July 27th had various upgrades related to multiple chain validation and bugfixes/improvements. 
You need to update Electrum manually and it's something most people forget. I think it's self explanatory that it's optimal to have the latest upgraded version - if working well.
I think Electrum is still very safe and up to date, anyone can check  their release notes on github by the way:

I would say not the worst time. You get a certain amount of certainty. The hardfork debate is partly over, segwit is locked in. It's less risky to buy now than at $2000 last time for example, it's always easy to look back. Don't do that and look forward. 
The price could go down a few hundred but I see no reason for a $500+ drop. We have higher support levels now.

Clearly unsustainable rise, as it would be for any coin. This is a pump incentivized by bigger players like Roger Ver. Now people are speculating and buying heaps, mainly on Asian exchanges. 
I think we won't see it succeed unless a large amount of BTC holders does sell or convert to BCH. A lot have both coins and will just hodl both ur dump BCH when a first downtrend appears.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:05:21
You should only invest a minority of the initial investment into alts, success rates are low and ROI's are high. You can make up to or higher than 50x your investment if one of those succeeds. 
Bitcoin is slightly overvalued now against alts, we are close to the bottem of the altcoin dip. Converting back to BTC now is not the right option for most coins. 
Wait till prices stabilize and then consider swapping a decent chunk to bitcoin. Sell of some completely and hodl on to a few. I personally have 90% bitcoin and 10% alts (most in ETH). You can also go 80/20, but that's up to you.
Last but not least: Do your own research. When you search for information on crypto's you hear a lot of contradictions. A lot of biased opions on various platforms INCLUDING this subreddit.

1. Yes
2. No those are not your public keys but probably your adresses. Public/private keys are used to "sign" transactions. Adressess are derived from those. You can receive btc on any of your adresses.
3. Always better to sweep than importing (safer).
4. Use the seed phrase, for example in Breadwallet.

6. Nope, private keys will always be part of bitcoin. Just keep them safe.
7. Scaling will provide options, for example the Lightning Network, which allow instant transactions. Other cryptos can be used for instant transactions too.
8. Explained in video I mentioned.
9. Yes, takes longer than the age of the universe to solve. &gt; 
10. Not sure what you mean, you can only store on paper wallet. You need internet and software (wallets) to send and receive BTC.

"This means that in as little as 11 days and most probably earlier the BCH chain will overtake the BTC chain to become the longer chain. Will we then call BCH Bitcoin?"
No, this is pure nonsense. The lenght of the chain has nothing to do with the viability of the coin. It's the proof of work that matters.
Right now it's multiple times easier to mine a BCH block. You need about 3-4x less computational power. 
Right now more than 85% of all the hashrate is still allocated towards bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:07:06
Breadwallet on an Iphone whitout jailbreak is very safe in my opinion. Even if they hack or steal your Iphone they need  your PIN +touch ID to make any transactions. Only remember to keep your seed offline on paper.
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:26:11
Individuals not so much, but large mining pools do care about their integrity. 
In the case that pools stated they would only support segwit and segwit2x in the future, it would be against their values to mine on the BCH chain for pure profits. They might lose potential customers (hashrate) if they do so, and ultimately it damages their integrity.
However, most pools claimed neutrality regarding the scaling issues. Saying they support both segwit2x and Bcash. Really it is just a profit incentive, they are able to mine the most profitable coin if they like to do so. This is what Roger Ver refers to as the "economic code" that led to the success of bitcoin. 
In my opinion we are at a stage where the economic code plays less of a role short term, because ongoing developments and adoption. Miners might chose to support core in hindsight of segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:16:44
You can always load your seed in any other BIP39 compatible wallet like Electrum anyway, in case the app is down/not functioning and you want to access your btc.
The Segwit activation is not hard fork btw... that actually happened already. Breadwallet supports BCH withdrawal. If you're meaning the upcoming fork segwit2x, that's in november.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:29:42
If that's true BCH should drop half in value too. Mining the BCH chain would become too profitable at a BTC price of $3500 and a BCH price of $600 and decreased difficulty. 
Obviously it would be the best scenario if BCH crashes in the coming days. BTC is taking all alts down too..
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:57:12
We've gone up $450 in 3 days whitout a correction, which might come soon and will come inevitably in the future. Bitcoin price isn't really underrated right now. Especially if you compare to other crypto's. Buying the dip is always better than buying when everyone is. 
Personally i'm hodling most of my btc  and converting a bit to some alt coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:46:40
They are probably correlated, at the exact timing the news came out the price dropped. It's also people selling anticipating a crash to buy in lower again. Saw some really big sells/orders on Bitfinex.

So btc was transferred out of Electrum 10 hours ago? When did the bitcoin cash transaction happen exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:44:48
Regulation and converting to currencies is something to overcome, banks are showing interest though and many countries like Japan, China, Australia and Switzerland accept digital currency. Even banks in Switzerland are now managing multiple cryptos. 
As the marketcap of bitcoin grows bigger, banks are incentivized to step in. To make bitcoin fail almost every government/bank in the world would have to be against bitcoin, which well never be the case. Countries not legalizing bitcoin would miss out on a big part of liquidity.
Anonomity plays a big role too, the goverment can't easily trace someones adresses. This makes it very impractible to seize any funds.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:34:44

I'ts still 700 sat/byte if you want to be sure that a transaction is included into the next block. 
350 sat/byte for a certainty of 90% that it is included in the next 1-5 blocks. 
If you use 40 sat/byte, it might take up to half a day to get confirmed if a bit unlucky. Ofcourse this might not be a huge problem, but some people just need very fast or instant transactions for services. Most wallets take the upper limit just to be sure.

Might rebounce some now on a shorter time frame, but the upcoming death cross and G20 FUD has become a self-fulfilling prophecy already. 
Hence, I might sell some. I'd rather sell some now and buy back in at $9k+ than to see it drop to $5k, unable to buy back in. That's really the equation right now in my head.
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:47:05
We didn't close lower than the  200h MA, going up right now.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:13:52
Well we will see, imo we are in a no trade zone. We aren't bullish but not bearish either. We colorflipped on the daily now, bouncing of a perfected TD 9 on the 4hr which was on the 200h MA. I'd say we're going up in the next days. Resistance then can be at the cross level or the upper line of this channel. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:59:00
Good thing is $6k did hold yesterday, we are now at $7100 and on a (daily!) TD 9. If we gain some momentum we are out of the danger zone atleast, which is $5k. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:31:04
Fees have been low the last weeks already, can't go much lower. $0.10 transactions is already dirt cheap. Also, fees are not the biggest burden for people to buy bitcoin. 
In the case for using it as a currency, sure it is, but that demand is not high otherwise the amount of transactions would rise. Adoption is a slow process.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:14:34
Well, we went from $8.3k to $11.3k within 5 days. That's a $3k move, and the biggest correction yet was only a $600 dollar dip. 
If you want fast sustained growth, you need these kind of corrections. Basically making higher lows so new people or whales can buy again. Otherwise the majority of people are just buying at all time highs all the time, which is unsustainable. 
You see the logic?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:10:02
Actually good news just came out, up to $4k+ in the next days!
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:17:48
Number of users will be far higher if bitcoin survives till than. Network fees will make up for all of the rewards I suspect. 
Miners will be economically incentivized to mine. Because smoother running network means for users, more users means scarcity in coins which will keep the price high. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:16:15
Really selling the dip, should have bought more imo. 
Every analyst predicted $3k and said it would be perfect for bitcoin to hit that number again to prepare setup for several weeks of upside. Don't trust your stomach but trust Montly, Weekly and daily graphs that are available. 
Even if you follow 5 mins of Tone Vays analysis on WCN you might get the clue.

Less likely we will see drops like that IMO because:
-Relatively higher market cap, big players have less impact on the price in general. Less price manipulation. 
-Lots of positive reference experiences with hurdles like a fork, hacks and regulation. 
-There is a lot more adoption in general. Think of legalisation in several countries like China and Japan.
-We've had several crashes now and recovered everytime, people will likely hold more or buy when prices are relatively low.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:30:18
Considerable chance we drop lower than $3000, if we do hit $2950 we will probably bounce back.
There is almost no buy support now, especially on Chinese exchanges where everyone is liquidating their btc.
Frankly, the market knows this and is anticipating a lower buy-in point.

I hope next daily candle in a few hours will be a nice push up. If we can get above $8K tomorrow, we got some room to move up before and of the week and hopely close this higher than it opened. $9k would be ideal, with 8k as closest support. 
We can only bottom lower if we touch the support lines multiple times. Now we are are higher again $5k is less likely than it was this morning at $6k for example. 
You can only look a certain amount of time ahead with TA, people see TA as useless but all it does is predicting scenarios at a given time.

Stuck below this 50 day moving average resistance line. We've been stabbing this resistance level for a total of 7 days in a month since june. Good thing is we went above the moving average, but didn't close on the daily. 
Good thing is it will be open air till $7.6k, then till $8.3k.
I bought some yesterday, which says something because I haven't been buying for months. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 07:54:46
Around $8250 at the 50 week MA, this was also a prior resistance line in the last week of may and the first week of june.  I wouldn't sell all, but certainly take profit. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:39:13
Closing the weekly on top of the candle and golden cross upcoming on 4h, the last time we had that was 3 months ago where from we made a $2k move up. Ofcourse there are a dozen arguments against this logic but the sentiment last weeks seems there is less potential for downside. 
If next week manages to break through this $6.8K-$7k resistance we can test the 50 week MA again.
In other words, next week will be quite interesting.
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:49:40
I see ascending/symmetric triangle and pennant formations on every timeframe up till the daily.
Almost certain we will test the 50D MA around $8500. After that probably a correction down, $5000 is a good possibility. 
So best to get in fiat/tether up when we go up another 500, $9k area is a big resistance cluster anyway, so you're not missing the boat. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:02:33
Haha guys, I'm just giving my perspective, we've had multiple of this bumps on the way down and I got caught in one of them too. Just zoom out.
And well, at least I got this short term forecast right. Let's see how we do now.
$5k is not some random number I came up with, it's just the last round number we broke through and never retested yet, therefore I consider it strong support. It's just that I don't see $6-$7k as support anymore, IF we get down there again.

Price is kind of stalling now around $2750. Positive news is more likely to happen than negative news. There could be some rumor in the coming months about the next steps in the scaling debate. This however, is highly unpredictable. 
No one can tell you when to buy exactly it depends mainly on the amount invested, risk you want to take and strategy. If you want to hold longterm, expect that the next few months can show lots of resistance around the $3000 mark. We need more support for that. If you are not willing to hold to end of the year, you might be better of not buying or buying the dip when everyone is selling.
Price is kind of high right now relatively, so it isn't ideal to buy anyway.

Very likely that it has a connection to BTC-e going down. The timeframe fits perfectly. BTC-e management might be deleting traces and what not. I don't believe the site is seized by the police or government.
An anonymous crypto exchange has to be one of the best options to launder money and bitcoins. This is one of the biggest bitcoin laundering arrests since the start and btc-e is one of the bigger exchanges. They even mention the date 2011, coincidently that's when btc-e was founded.

Low electricity costs are a must to turn a considerable profit, it's best to buy an ASIC system. Something like the Avalon6 or Antminer S9 is far more efficient and less energy consuming than any GPU.

I assume you mean Electrum wallet.
A simple google search will get you the answer.
Here is the most important instruction:
How to redeem my BCC?
BCC wallets will require you to import your seed or your private keys,
which can be exported from Electrum. Doing so will expose all your
Bitcoin funds associated with that seed to the BCC wallet you decide
to use.
Therefore, *after* the BCC fork, but *before* you enter a seed or
private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new
Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the
old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay
protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin
wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This
will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software.
So Electrum itself doesn't support BCC, as most other wallets. Since Electrum uses seedphrase recovery and lets you export private keys it's very easy to acclaim your BCC after august 1.

Yes that was my first idea. But from my understanding there are different derivation paths for seeds? In other words, you can't just simply recover the mnemonic in another wallet randomly?
 
It seems you can export your private key manually using:    
In that way I can derive the private key and import it into another wallet?

After august one you will need to send your btc to another Electrum btc wallet as stated. This wallet will have its own new seed and keys. 
Your bcc will still be on your old keys, Electrum doesn't support so you load your old seed phrase/keys in a compatible wallet.

The price of cryptocurrencies is more volatile as the value of cryptos is determined purely by valuation of the people that are buying/selling and partly by supply and demand (there is and will be a finite amount of bitcoin). 
Regular stocks can have underlying value because companies possess assets. These always represent a portion of the value of the stock. 
I would say cryptos are more comparable to start up stocks like Snapchat, Tesla, uber for example. But even more volatile because cryptos are built on a new technology. So more comparable to the early 2000's when the internet was new and a lot of companies were coming up. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:39:27
One of the better wallets to keep it on if you want to keep your btc on a wallet. Electrum has been testing and simulating fork scenarios for over a month. 
Ofcourse a hardware or paper wallet is always the safest.
By the way, if you have your wallet protected by a seed phrase you can ALWAYS derive private keys manually or automatically by restoring in other wallets.
It is not the loss of bitcoins that scares most people, but the distrust in developers to handle fork scenarios.

Lost bitcoins make up for less demand, I don't know how much are "lost" though. But even if it is like 5%, it does have a considerable effect on the price.

Electrum for pc, breadwallet for phone.

You probably set a way too low fee. Multibit doesn't have an automated fee option, so you have to set it yourself. If you didn't adjust it is set at 0,1 mB /KB, way too low to get confirmed. (although it might eventually after some weeks)
Try this viabtc accelerator, post your transaction ID here to have a higher chance of being included in a next block:
Than wait for a day or so, if that still doesn't work try their paid accelerator service. That costs like 7$ but will certainly confirm. 
I know this because I had the exact same problem.

Have the same problem, my wallet doesn't let me add any fee. Viabtc isn't working for me at the moment. 
Pushtx.btc charges like 9$ for what is a 24$ transaction.

Yeah I think the best line is to hold when you bought in relatively high. Maybe buy some more if there is a panic crash. Eventually bitcoin will overcome the obstacles. - Might take some months though

Yes probably, don't cry and don't sell. Many are in the same boat as you, me aswell.

Who on earth would give their recovery words to a 3rd party to let them control their wallet. Looks fishy.

Bought 3 days ago at $2,5k when I thought the correction was over.  Turns out it's not. Keep in mind that people are a little overskeptical at the moment and especially about august 1. Just hold no matter what.

I would wait a little bit till its clear which wallet is safe and can be trusted. There will be a lot of fraudulent wallets and services up in the next week.

Just not enough buyer support last weeks around the higher levels and people selling because of uncertainty around the scaling debate.

GPU's might be so fast en efficient by then that it requires little power and time to process transactions. 
Also there might be a spectrum of used cryptocurrencies by then, which are way more technological advanced.

No it's not, he paid 426.265 sat/B. 70.000-80.000 should be fine for a &lt;30min confirmation.
You paid way too high fees, and yes the amount of $ doesn't influence the fee, you pay per byte.

No one knows, there is no perfect answer. The price could go up, but could also go down. Truth is though that btc price has been up every month since April. 
Nothing really new has happened, only increased volume by more coverage and interest and the rise of ETH. If you buy you must be able to hold if there is another correction in the next months. 
If there is enough adoption and a clear solution around the scaling issue, there is no reason to not have an all-time-high again.

$50M worth of bitcoins in just 1 wallet? wow
