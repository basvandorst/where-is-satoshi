ITT: Wary investors being wary. People already invested defending their investments tooth and nail.

I think the petrodollar had a lot to do with it.

I was born in '92 my man, I think you're projecting.
Just because it's "revolutionary", doesn't make it immune to inflation and crashing. If anything, it's making it more prone to inflation when tech-fascinated investors swarm to "revolutionary" technologies that *they* don't fully understand. I just try to maintain a practical, real world position, not an ideological extreme "the future is now" stance.
After all, if it's adopted as a standard, specifically if it can get enough buying/selling power behind it, it could be a lasting staple. Decentralization is the future I want to believe in, but **practically**, there are many hurdles before we can get there. And, as with any market, you are still going to find yourselves at the whims of more savvy investors wielding much bigger sticks. This makes **investors wary**. Pointing this out seems to make the invested very defensive (example: you)
But it could also fail out the gate. If you're getting pissed because I think it could fail (something never stated in what you replied to), you're proudly displaying your ignorance here. Even a soft admission that it's not impossible to fail, I would accept.

Imagine an EMP.
Good luck sleeping...

I'm just waiting for universal Credits, like from Star Wars.
I considered bitcoin the next step towards that. Far from it, though, as it's little more than a bubble with wings at this point.

It's a bubble. But from the looks of some of the commenters here, they're willing to cling to it, so as long as they're willing to buy it, it's "stable".
I imagine it's great for all sorts of shady enterprises, though. Dark net transactions, tax loopholes, currency manipulation/hedging, etc...
Also, they have marketed it very well. Powered by people who get to "earn money" by "running a program in the background of their computer" (the reason why the market is as big as it is, that sentence tends to draw in a lot of kids/moneygrubbers)
If you're not in already, I'd be careful stepping in to the daytime trading arena. If you are in, best of luck at jumping ship at the most profitable point in time, and *before* any crash, where it becomes near impossible to sell.
