Thanks for the advice

This is not all my savings just an account I haven't been able to touch until I turned 18. I'm also finishing up an engineering degree and have a couple prospects lined up from previous short term jobs I've had, I was just wondering if Bitcoin was the best thing I could be investing in. Is the risk worth the reward compared to other options

But if I'm buying it slowly, and paying more and more for the same amount every day as it climbs, aren't I in a worse position if it drops suddenly? Thanks for the advice, might have to bear with me a bit.

So is the idea to buy slowly as it increases and slightly quicker as it decreases? I see your point now, thanks again

Treating the money they've saved for me with respect is why I'm here asking questions about how to make it grow and not cashing it out and spending it on shite I'll forget about in a year. I do appreciate the advice

I'm in a position where I'm extremely comfortable investing all of the money. I'm not reliant on this money at all in any way. I'm just trying to figure out the smartest thing to do with it. My dad is very smart and will give me solid advice but I want to go to him with a pretty good idea of what I should and shouldn't do. Another commenter suggested buying BTC and gambling on a couple smaller coins. Does that seem like a good idea to you? Thanks for all the help it's hugely appreciated

2017 seems like it has been particularly volatile, do you think it will decrease again in the near future? If you were in my position would you think now is a good time to buy?

Think it may be a good idea to maybe split it into 3, and buy Bitcoin and two other smaller coins? Get the relatively safe investment with BTC and maybe get lucky with one of the other two?

This is essentially birthday money I haven't been able to touch for 18 years. I'm comfortable playing with all of it as I have pretty good prospects lined up for the near future and have other savings besides. Still a bad idea to sink all?
