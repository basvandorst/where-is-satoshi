The current systems are under the plain sight of corruption. From the major fake news in India where a draft bill proposes a jail term of 10y for holding, issuing and mining cryptocurrencies.
**It impounds the lackey power that centralized authorities and structures can show.** 
The whole philosophy of decentralization through bitcoin and blockchain has to overpower these centralized processes: As it better demonstrates that power should never be held by one or a majority, but by everybody.

Well said but don't think that's how the significant majority think. The institutions and HNIs aren't buying because they worry about inflation, which favours them.

This was inevitable. Also, with more surveillance and regulation, it is likely that more people will adopt crypto and bring more utility, which should be net positive in the long term. I think it is evolution of the cryptosphere. 
To beat the system, one first needs to be part of the system :)

So they want to enter at high prices when there could again be a pull back? More prudent approach will be to accumulate in small quantities at different prices, to average it out, and hold on to it for at least a couple of years.

Maybe the B stands for Brexit, so the dysfunctional machine makes sense!

I just find it ironic that we are hell bent on getting institutional adoption for bitcoin which I think defeats the purpose...
