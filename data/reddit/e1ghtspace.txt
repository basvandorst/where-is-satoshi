Are you able to find the bank transaction for when you sent the aud  to the exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:08:57
The 4th should be red, though it is still possible to be green. The 5th one seems right to me though.

Did you buy it? We're up more than 800 usd on bitfinex since then. (It was at 13300 usd when I made the comment)
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:41:51
Ah yes, I didnt think of the tip bot moving completely over to the LN.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:51:48
Maybe. :)

Throw away wallets? What do you mean? You could just send the btc to each person's address... right?

Profit that outpaces inflation?

And you can only text/call people who also have an apple unlimited device.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:26:16

You can search for the address where you moved the coins into and get the date that happened. But it wont be helpful if you moved them into the new wallet long after buying them.
 Use the search on this site.

30K I think.

Won't transfers to the lightning network cost normal fees?
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:07:09
I would love to see a link to this.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:55:02
Yes but dont you need to move your coins onto the lightning network and that would be a bitcoin transaction (not lightning)?

He's saying two of the things on the list aren't investments. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:45:09
I read your comment and then looked at the chart and saw it was dipping right then, so I said now. :) Nice job buying!
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:40:24
mmm. If the 4th candle was red it would look better.
@_date: 2018-10-31 06:52:20
I would have been rich af from bitcoin but unfortunately I was drowning in pussy and literally had no free time.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:20:43
They edited it to say "Steepest drop" instead. Wow I wouldn't trust a news website that can't even research properly.
@_date: 2017-01-06 09:39:59
Sorry, I didn't see the actual original but just assumed that they edited it.
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:26:41
Nice! This is real comedy gold. Amazing.
@_date: 2017-01-10 04:13:46
Homeless, but with $1,000,000... sure...
Edit: Oh right, there is so much inflation that 1 mil is worthless.
@_date: 2017-01-10 04:25:21
This isn't working lol
@_date: 2019-06-03 04:20:23
Gotta press F11
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:49:07
But they wont each have one?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:00:54
$4000 is what I was thinking when it was at 18k.
@_date: 2018-03-05 08:26:10
