It's not only coinbase. Every big company is scared of social media and needs to react immediately. Just mafia companies like Btc-E just don't care.

In the article it's not about math. Russia is scared people start exchanging russian rubles into other currencies. Basically hurting the economy even more.
In this case bitcoin is especially good for money laundering and nobody can deny that.
I see where Russia is coming from with that.
**Is it right ?** No
**Are they corrupt ?** Probably
**Are they scared ?** Definitely
I like it when we make whole countries nervous. We are on the right path.
**This is actually good news. If we don't rattle the cages we ain't going nowhere.**
Every enemy is forcing us to keep going. It doesn't matter who we against at, Goverment, Altcoins, Spammer. Right now I suppose we are doing a great job even with all these discussions about the core.

Adoption of big companies. You dislike MS products ? Million of people love them. This is a big loss here.

BTC-E is extremely shady. I deposited 500€, sent all documents and stuff. They still withold the money. I have proofs nobody cares.

Blockchain.info is a dangerous site and in my opinion not good for bitcoin.

Once you are past the reserved proxy ip it's too late. There are a lot of ways to cross it.

You are right. This is what bitcoin needs, smart solutions with a nice usability.
edit: Or Let me say it in a different way: This is what I need and what I like.

You can mix it. Once you passed at least 20-30 wallets it's impossible to proof who they belong to.
That's the thing about bitcoin, there is no identification required for having an address. So people might guess but you can *never* proof.
They'll probably hold the coins instead of cashing them out instantly anyway.
