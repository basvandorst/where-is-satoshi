Itbit and Gdax, but those are not European exchanges... btw. Kraken is US.
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:58:35
Hm works for me...
Try this one: 
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:03:49
Yep, still big!
 
@_date: 2016-08-24 17:49:27
@_date: 2016-08-11 09:25:49
I think that okcoin USD is HK, while CNY is Beijing? 
@_date: 2016-08-13 22:08:59
If .cn goes down .com will follow, since .com futures taking liquidity from .cn...
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:49:55
Why would they buy Finex? All Stamp needs to do is add leverage which is only waiting for regulatory approval... Everything else is ready (according to Bitstamp CEO).
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:08:07
Gemini, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Itbit... I think they are all insured.
@_date: 2016-08-13 17:48:34
So... Okcasino about to close down? Chinese gov. does not like if someone else (beside them) is doing money laundering :)
@_date: 2016-08-24 21:19:16
If I were you, I would start running local bitcoin exchange service. Clearly a golden opportunity :)
@_date: 2016-08-22 09:09:18
It's hard to buy xmr without btc ;)
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:57:24
Thanks! Will donate 200btc to charity.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:52:22
I use Bitstamp. But you also have Xapo, Bitpay.... Or simply one of those two you wrote ;)
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:35:14
Get yourself one of btc credit cards! You won't regret it ;)
@_date: 2016-08-23 12:09:08
Nicely written! Looking forward to see what is coming :)
@_date: 2016-08-26 18:13:44
Well this was expected... Fact that they didn't disapprove after first period is positive! 
@_date: 2016-08-26 11:06:14
Buy on Korbit and sell on Gdax/Itbit/Bitstamp at limit price you want? We have 5$ volatility on daily basis so your limit order should be hit ;)
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:42:36
People will continue using this and finex just like they used MtGox after June 2013. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:44:03
Like they can do this :D 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:48:57
Sell all :)
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:39:48
In US use Gemini, EU Bitstamp, Korea Korbit, Japan Bitflyer and you should be fine... (for other countries you can also use Bitstamp) :) 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:44:38
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:31:05
They don't do neither of what is written?
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:00:36
Bitstamp is the best exchange around. Using it since 2013 and never had a problem with. Anyone saying otherwise... simply play by their rules.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:00:32
Back in 2013 one guy from bitcointalk bought Lambo with btc... Probably first such buy trough official car dealer.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:12:03
Don't use stop loss orders... exchanges are not reliable and liquidity is a joke.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:52:10
Drop in transactions... People not using btc atm as much as  they use to.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:08:24
They are.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:40:22
It's just greed... People hopping to buy more lower.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:53:34
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:23:24
Took long enough!
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:03:49
Send one to F2Pool also.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:58:18
Using them since 2013. Best in the business!
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:58:05
Bitstamp (they use MasterCard).
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:51:52
Use Bitstamp.
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:52:04
Coinbase, Bitpay, Bitfinex, Gemini, Bitmex, Blockchain.info are major idiots in this game.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:28:24
Can you paste tx? It's easy to check...
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:00:50
We need to push on Bitfinex and Gemini...
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:22:14
Way to do it... Probably most transparent exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:00:00
Their founders are early adopters (2011)... 20k btc is/was nothing for them.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:27:55
You buy them for him? You two can start selling on LocalBitcoins also :)
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:44:21
This. Spot traders need to stop pushing this down. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:50:55
Bitwala wallet added SW also.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:12:39
Trezor is what you need.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:16:45
You will get it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:12:09
Bitwala, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Bitpay, Bitmex, Blockchain.info... Those are biggest service providers that need to activate SW.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:46:36
They need to get educated... I suppose bitcoiners in Greece could start some good businesses in case of capital controls :)
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:31:37
Capital controls... Greeks just need to find out that bitcoin can be perfect solution to go around.
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:08:53
Everyone owns computers and smart phones. Making a secure online or offline wallet isn't that hard.
People just need to educate. After that, one tells another and so on...
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:30:06
People need to stop looking at those Chinese exchanges. Worst thing ever that happened to bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:14:49
It's more like spot shorting... not Futures market. Google?
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:03:36
It also can be Bitmex  alone changing cold wallets? Maybe they are upgrading to SW?
@_date: 2018-08-21 10:06:34
What about SW?
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:22:39
Looks like it was removed? Can't find it anymore... And yes under payment option.
@_date: 2018-08-21 10:16:16
I mean for deposits and withdraws. Bitmex promised that a while ago but there was no announcement from their side later... 
@_date: 2018-08-21 11:14:10
If deposit address starts with 3 doesn't mean it automatically SW address.
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:37:07
Interesting. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:14:04
No idea, but shorts are paying longs on bitmex for few days now.
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:14:29
They are batching for 2\-3 years.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:00:23
I usually book all hotels with expedia... but it is true that sometimes some hotels are not possible to book with btc. No idea why. Same goes for plane tickets. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:00:38
Get ready! :)
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:26:58
Because CORE...
@_date: 2017-02-03 13:44:52
Maybe ask core and miners why the fuck they can't find consensus?
@_date: 2017-02-09 12:32:49
They probably hold a lot more as 100k... but yeah completely agree with you:)
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:23:06
On the other hand... Core is not doing much to solve the problem. Some shady ideas for which even they don't know results and so. 
Satoshi you're needed! :) 
@_date: 2017-02-15 23:12:55
He has other more interesting things to do, but I bet he will buy one of btc or blockchain start ups in the future.
@_date: 2017-02-12 13:24:44
Will do the same, only that amount will be smaller :)
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:23:25
Core, miners and other community are not worth of this. Is it really so hard to bring up 2MB blocks?
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:29:25
Simply don't use them, look at them, think about them? Chinese exchanges are done.
@_date: 2016-03-04 15:38:50
Anyone trading here?
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:41:03
Who cares?
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:37:09
Gemini and Itbit.
@_date: 2017-02-19 18:05:56
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:09:12
I did mention all actors and I believe 2MB would easily get consensus.
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:16:44
Right... because paying high fees is what bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:52:09
Ask Core, they have all the answers.
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:48:41
Will be the same with all exchanges. Gemini, Bitstamp, Itbit and Bitflyer will probably work the best.
@_date: 2016-03-04 00:26:38
This! 
@_date: 2016-01-04 22:28:43
When there is price movement they usually have more volume than Coinbase, Kraken and Itbit combined. Bitfinex has that volume only because of leverage... When Bitstamp adds leverage they will be on the first place ($) in less than a week ;) 
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:11:07
Gemini, Itbit or Bitstamp are for you.
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:01:03
Bitstamp uses Bitgo hot wallet... so it will be ready when BitGo will be.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:09:06
@_date: 2017-03-06 11:37:10
And why does Africa deserve 0 fees/costs? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:08:50
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:22:06
Actually core didn't do what they have promised...
@_date: 2016-01-15 10:30:05
Why do you guys care so much what he does? Ignore him and world will be better. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 13:57:04
Use Gemini, Itbit or Bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:59:34
2mb+sw was original plan from HK... miners agreed with that.
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:41:07
I think this is cold storage from one of exchanges...
@_date: 2016-01-04 19:14:24
1. Costumers funds were not effected.
2. They were on all other conferences later.
3. In AMA Bitstamp CEO said that they did an audit in December because of Bitlicens (will be available soon). 
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:11:17
Now this is something... 
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:36:42
This is why Bitstamp is the best and industry leader despite they don't have the highest volume. Once they add leverage they will dominate the market. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:01:25
Even better, since this solution will solve this problem for next 4 years then? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:46:15
I bet this would would get 100% support... Core? 
Bitcoin doesn't need enemies until it has egos (on both sides) with such power!
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:45:04
Core would not agree... :)
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:28:34
2mb+sw would solve this problem for next 3 years... then lightening.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:43:26
2MB+SW was original plan... then someone decided to change the plan.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:56:08
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:45:15
Thought: egos on both sides will destroy this. Who needs bankers to fuck this up when... ?
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:19:36
Unless you buy back lower and get more btc... those who are pushing down, win.
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:31:29
2MB would get instant approval from every mining pool. SW + 2MB was the agreement.
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:22:09
This is what happens when you use unregulated exchange. I stopped trading there back in 2015 when their trading engine collapsed. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 11:43:40

@_date: 2016-06-07 13:37:10
Bitcoin Investment Trust: GBTC (OTC trading) 
Global advisors: GABI 
XBT Provider: ETN (closes to etf) 
@_date: 2016-06-28 12:43:19
hah :D
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:45:38
Long 50x.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:25:00
Or ask Core for 2MB blocks?
@_date: 2016-06-22 15:06:01
I would rather advise you to simply provide liquidity (loaning) for btc swaps on different (to avoid risk) exchanges... mangr, bitfinex, poloniex.
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:35:38
You clearly don't know how margin trading works... go google it.
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:09:00
Can we make a blacklist of businesses which did not implement SW yet? 
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:21:32
I did write "usually" :)
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:16:10
It will be approved. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:09:21
Can we make a blacklist of businesses which did not implement SW yet? 
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:17:14
Or they simply stop fucking with the price and volumes? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:16:37
Would help if you tell your location.
@_date: 2018-10-09 17:19:08
Buy one more phone sim card just for that (one not on your name)?
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:14:01
This is fucking huge step for real btc usage.
@_date: 2017-01-07 13:04:38
They only support UK.
@_date: 2016-06-20 12:10:02
And people are still selling :)
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:16:11
Finally! Next step for PBOC is to shut down OKcoin futures! 
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:32:12
It's fake volume.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:47:44
Bitstamp, Gemini, Itbit.
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:12:56
Localbitcoins, bitcoin ATMs...
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:19:06
Gemini, Itbit, Bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:37:01
Fully agree! I hope for consensus and that this will happen in 2018.
@_date: 2017-01-15 11:56:00
Use localbitcoins to find buyers/sellers and fees won't be that high.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:52:11
Needs to hit 4800$+ first.
@_date: 2018-10-23 09:58:41
We need a blacklist of companies which did not implement SW yet.
@_date: 2017-01-15 19:50:37
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:18:31
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:36:56
Waiting for okscam to do the same... Huoni already limited it to 100k CNY. So no more credit bubbles, which is good.
@_date: 2016-11-08 21:57:10
Well, it's a bit late for this to go live this year since it usually takes few months after approval... 
@_date: 2018-10-27 12:17:41
Buy more and maybe price will move up :) 
@_date: 2016-11-08 19:53:44
Just wow!
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:38:13
Depends on the exchange...
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:04:39
Finally!!! cnLedger is usually a reliable source.
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:52:50
@_date: 2016-11-08 21:55:54
As said, just a small % (sub 1%) of that money needs to find it's way into btc. And someone here calculated amount of that money is 300bil$+... So, really small % needed :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:45:28
No worries... Putin and Bitfury will take this opportunity with open arms :)
@_date: 2016-11-14 08:54:38
You did right. Bitstamp is the best for spot buying/selling.
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:55:41
They have also invested in eth sub 7$... They said in one interview that they are major holder of eth also. Winklevoss Capital portfolio also looks amazing!
They really know where to put their money.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:58:20
But you can confirm Core has a plan to increase block limit in 2018/2019? I mean you all could find a consensus and increase it in Q1 I suppose... that way everyone would be happy, or?
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:03:52
He made up whole list with his imaginary friends... What else to say?
@_date: 2016-11-06 10:13:24
Btc ATM?
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:13:12
Please stop... 
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:07:28
Since Core has on its road map to increase blocksize limit in the future... SW2x is probably as close we can get to consensus?
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:40:20
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:10:41
Maybe... 
@_date: 2016-11-02 23:22:26
I believe you want to hold for few months more... :)
@_date: 2016-11-13 21:29:53
Bitstamp, Kraken, Itbit, Gemini
@_date: 2017-01-23 12:12:24
This is just a start... OKcoin.com will get hit also, sooner or later.
@_date: 2016-11-03 15:17:05
From all options above, go with Xapo. But check also Bitpay and Bitstamp... 
@_date: 2016-11-02 09:13:29
People still think they need to buy whole btc to own some... Is it really so hard to read something on internet? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:45:47
Sell it on LocalBitcoins or OTC.
@_date: 2016-11-14 13:51:16
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:12:04
I bet fees are not that big issue when you want to hide how much do you own. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 19:21:14
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:16:04
Yeah, "poor" people:) Np.
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:09:37
Use Gemini or Itbit. Can't get more regulated as that.

If you get 1mil people to buy 0.03 btc today and you all hold until 2024.
@_date: 2016-12-15 16:59:02
Bitstamp, Itbit, Kraken, Gemini. You can't go wrong with those.
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:34:49
Where are you from? It is possible to buy btc very easily in some EU countries... Also, try to find btc ATM.
@_date: 2016-11-04 09:33:20
Well Bitstamp has that EU licence and Xapo is from US... both from highly regulated countries ;) 
@_date: 2019-08-21 18:00:35
Bitmex still without batching and SW support...
@_date: 2018-10-05 11:34:47
You can not have a debate with Roger since he is constantly interrupting everyone.
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:57:00
Well Xapo and Bitstamp are both industry leaders, a bit expensive but highly regulated. Both cards are a bit different so you should check which one is the best for you ;) Btw. Coinbase has its own card also I think.
@_date: 2019-10-16 13:44:08
Gemini, Coinbase, Itbit, Bitstamp.
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:08:45
If small % of that money finds it's way to btc, moon. We're talking about India grey economy here! Billions $ economy.
@_date: 2016-11-08 15:47:06
If only someone would explain how btc works to those "poor"  people :)
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:09:18
Maybe also take advantage of that market and buy some btc?
@_date: 2019-10-21 18:35:13
Bitstamp, and it is cheaper.
@_date: 2016-11-02 16:00:55
Question is, why there is not already 5mil people (would be awesome) using this? 5mil of new active users would probably turn this ecosystem upside down (in good way) :)
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:56:59
Question how far is Bitfury 100MW project. There are also Mcafee and others...
@_date: 2019-10-18 09:08:11

@_date: 2019-08-06 11:34:50
We need to get SW adoption above 60%...
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:03:57
Don't day trade. Free advice.
@_date: 2019-10-06 22:04:02
Bitmex. And yes.
@_date: 2019-10-03 17:53:31
Learn from history.
@_date: 2016-12-12 16:31:28
Bitstamp, Gemini, Itbit, Coinfloor (buying directly with GBP).
@_date: 2019-10-08 07:57:00
Finally SW adoption is staying above 55%! Still community needs to push Bitmex, Binance, [Blockchain.info]( and others to implement it before the end of 2019!
@_date: 2019-10-18 09:18:55

You don't need confirmation... Transaction just needs to seen on blockchain (0 confirmation needed).
@_date: 2015-08-08 15:22:57
Bitcoin needs less price manipulation. After that, people will actually start to use it... because they won't be loosing 4% in a day. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:47:31
True... But if traders would leave them they could only do inside trading with themselves.

I also doubt it is so much. On the other hand in 1.5mil btc was "destroyed" by Satoshi and a lot was lost in early days (when they had low value and people didn't care much if they lost 5k or more... Well 1btc can get split on 8 decimals. Final number of coins can be changed with fork, but this won't happen. At least not until all coins are mined. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:17:32
Does btc really need such twits? 
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:37:29
This looks big.
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:48:06
Made by Bitpay.
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:30:31
Don't know... those wallets are from their pool.
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:46:15
There are some bitcoin ATMs in NY... 
@_date: 2015-08-26 21:27:10
1. Use Bitstamp for trading (enough liquidity).
2. For cold storage make a paper wallet. If you want to store bitcoins online use Bitgo or Coinbase vault.
3. Copay is an opensource wallet made by Bitpay (trusted bitcoin company). I use it on my phone... Works good!
4. Check coinmap.org and start spending your bitcoins ;)
@_date: 2015-08-28 09:28:05
Another black mark for Bitfinex! In that case they should identify the "owner" of those coins.
@_date: 2015-08-24 22:12:49
Didn't one of OKcoin employers said that the volume is fake? 
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:27:30
Yep. When this happened during the flash crash they should stop the trading and reverse all the traders before the flash crash. Even if they would go offline for one or two days because of upgrade traders would understand this (Bitstamp was down offline for 5 days and everything was ok). But we know why Bitfinex didn't do this... Their market maker wanted those coins from margin calls!! I really did a lot of trading on bitfinex, but now I'm not trading there even if they are the last exchange on the world. 
@_date: 2015-08-08 15:11:02
If you want to buy: Localbitcoins, Cavirtex, Bitstamp, Bitcoin ATMs ( 
To understand how it works: bitcoin.org, bitcointalk.org.
@_date: 2015-08-27 23:07:39
Continue buying. There is a halving in less than a year... Expect a hype as soon as this fork saga ends. Also i guess it is better to hold bitcoin as your national currency.
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:18:41
For now they are mining (and holding) coins... 
@_date: 2015-08-25 02:35:24
Would also like to know that! Bitfinex is the source of market manipulation...
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:20:11
He did not lose it because he did not sell btc. He can afford to hold them for many years. So...
@_date: 2015-08-10 21:30:11
... and on the end they join you. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:59:53
Panties with QR code (address from wallet)? :) 
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:55:15
True... but coins can be tracked. Because those coins were stolen one should expect Bitfinex will mark them and call the authorities. Every fair exchange would do that. I guess that new owner of those coins must be near Bitfinex owners? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:31:20
Maybe you're being naive?
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:34:51
Never used it... Barry Silbert is connected with them, so I guess they are good. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:10:43
I'm actually surprised this didn't go to at least 6500$ already... Buying pressure is here.
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:21:12
Everyone should ask them that on twitter. Same goes for Bitmex!
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:46:58
Bitwala adding soon.
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:10:37
Not available in your country... ble.

Stock bubble already started to burst... DOW is already in bear correction.  
@_date: 2015-08-27 23:00:31
MtGox took only coins from exchange. Hah, they sure will! Price after the halving will surprise even the biggest bulls! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:27:13
Bitfinex is cancer.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:44:56
Copay, Mycelium, Bitwala (adding SW soon)...
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:53:59
Understand. Personally I will keep using Bitstamp... This decision doesn't really concerns me. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:43:49
When they get license they will probably get bigger costumers from NY that you can imagen. They are the best in the business and if you personally haven't had problems with their service you aren't doing a favour to yourself. 
@_date: 2015-08-08 10:38:25
How do you know this is Bitfinex cold storage? I suppose It would be used more often if it would be... It is only second transaction out (first bigger than 0.1btc) since wallet was created (December 2014).

@_date: 2019-10-07 15:05:21
I don't know where you're from, but where I live people are able to change the bank in a day. Pretty sure you can find "crypto friendly" bank. Best way to do it is that you have bank account in the same bank as you exchange has.
@_date: 2015-08-06 09:11:19
You don't really need a bank account to deposit money on exchanges... OP should do a direct deposit on their account (from any bank). He would need bank account in case he would like to withdraw fiat.
@_date: 2015-08-15 12:39:40
Bitstamp, Itbit, Coinbase and other serious exchanges applied for Bitlicense.
Kraken, Bitfinex, Poloniex didn't because of extra regulations for lending money. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:47:10
C'mon... don't say that you really believe this story? There are rules in NY if you want to have margin trading and those rules are harsh.
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:12:58
They took the blame on themselves yes, but they should know how much their platform can take it. Fact that they still don't have the solution for this screams for moving the funds out until they don't fix it. Also all those answers from their CFO are not really useful. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 18:05:07
What is the catch here? 
@_date: 2015-08-06 09:19:14
Itbit, Bitstamp...
Also you can try 
@_date: 2015-08-28 10:46:03
Not sure if we speak about the same halving? Block reward halving is what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2015-08-18 14:10:46
Great project! But first they should educate people (especially young ones) what bitcoin and blockchain actually means.
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:45:13
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:46:19
+1. Bitfinex is also the main exchange where the current price manipulation is happening. 
Community should stop them! 
@_date: 2015-08-28 09:24:21
Not worth it. Better buy bitcoins with that money.
@_date: 2015-08-30 09:36:45
Copay! Open source, multi-sig, build by bitpay...
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:25:19
Bitstamp, Gdax, Gemini, Itbit... Others are just pure gamble.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:51:41
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:16:56
It is possible. Well Stamp has EU license... For me it's better as Gdax, despite fees.
@_date: 2015-08-15 12:37:40
With their fake volume and fractional reserve trading? 
If Gemini order book will be hit with institutional money they will be the most liquid exchange. Real big traders are looking for liquidity not leverage. 
@_date: 2019-12-17 12:43:40
Finex has max 3x leverage. So longing 7100-7400$ levels seems safe for big players...
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:39:42
Regulations, AML/KYC policy.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:15:02
Use Bitstamp.

@_date: 2015-08-28 19:56:41
It was a robbery.... As part of the community they should freeze that account and call the authorities.  
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:36:49
Can't say I'm surprised... I took my coins out right after the flash crash.
@_date: 2015-08-18 07:55:34
Buy bitcoins on localbitcoins or on ATMs.
@_date: 2015-08-06 23:47:20
I'm using Copay on my windows phone for paying small amounts. Works great!
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:27:43
Also this one (for EU)! cubits.com
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:23:25
No... QR code would only represent an address... Bitcoins are stored in a wallet (online or offline), which has that address. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 09:28:17
Coinbase, GoCoin, Bitpay, Coinfiy, Safello, BitPagos, Stripe, Braintree (paypal company)...

Exchange: Bitstamp  
Mobile wallet: Blockstream Green  
Cold wallet: Trezor
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:01:45

Rather use localbitcoins, ATMs or mycelium trader. 
@_date: 2019-12-17 12:46:14

I'm posting links about bitcoin on my facebook wall almost every 3 days and must say that many already bought bitcoin. Two friends actually started business after I told them for bitcoin a year ago. All we need is to educate them. Also I don't think this is spamming, more posting interesting facts. If you have 1k friends on facebook or 1k followers on twitter I'm sure few people will find those posts useful.

You should start using other services.

Pantera invested in Bitstamp... can't say this is a surprise. Bitstamp simply wants share of a NY cake, so it isn't hard to understand them. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:33:27
Well... we don't have much to lose if we promote bitcoin/blockchain a bit? 
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:36:50
Interesting... maybe some wrong deposits or? Not much tx actually... Because I'm kinda sure Bitstamp won't support USDT anytime soon.  
Nah. Just following this for my own record ;)
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:28:43
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:30:29
Thanks. I think that bitcoiners should do more for bitcoin promotion rather than just complain how people are "stupid" because they don't use that technology and waiting for magical mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:05:18
Nice!

You can not go much wrong with buying btc when daily RSI is sub 30. If you want to buy more often then 6h.

Same here.

Price is up 100% from the bottom. If you would say to me back in January 2016 that price will be around 7000$ 4 months before 2020 reward drop I would call you crazy.

@_date: 2019-12-02 14:54:50
Bitstamp does not support USDT.  
Bitstamp holding only 29k eth? If you check only ethusd orderbook on their site you can see there is 27k eth on ask side alone. Then you have 2 more pairs and what is not placed in orderbook.  
Bitstamp cold wallet  [ ... I highly doubt they have another 100k+ in other wallets.  
Coinbase holds so many because it took over Xapo.
I think you have some errors there.
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:49:27
Gemini and Itbit?

Also Bitstamp is holding way more eth as 26k. EthUsd pair alone has 30k on ask side.
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:48:35
Move to btc/usd on Stamp.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:57:07
Gemini or Itbit.
@_date: 2016-09-05 08:56:27
Localbitcoins.

@_date: 2016-09-13 15:32:04
I'm in btc since early 2013 and yes I saw that many times... Problem is that people still find this shit as "normal behaviour"! Market should mature if we want to see btc adoption.
@_date: 2016-09-06 12:21:02
Bitstamp, Itbit, Gemini, Kraken.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:28:56
Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Bitmex, (Bitflyer?). Those are major players that aren't batch atm.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:24:06

@_date: 2016-09-05 12:34:54
Easy solution: 
@_date: 2016-09-12 09:44:50
I would use Bitstamp, Itbit or Gemini (last two are US based). You can forget about privacy since you will make a wire.

Bitstamp, Gdax, Gemini, Bitflyer.

@_date: 2019-09-19 10:24:17
@_date: 2015-09-25 09:39:47
If you don't need the money urgently... wait for the halving. Nothing will get you bigger profit than that ;) 
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:36:19
Avg is normal...
@_date: 2015-09-01 11:19:47
For buying you can use: Igot, LocalBitcoins, Myceliumtrader or ATMs (coinatmradar.com)... If you want to store bitcoins for long term create offline wallet. If you will use them regular use one of the wallets: bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet . Personally I'm using Copay. 
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:15:41
Fidor bank from Germany.

This is why I'm not selling a satoshi in next 12 months... and because of halving of course :)

Way to do it! You just need to do some good publicity now... Also convince local businesses to start accepting bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:08:03
@_date: 2015-09-21 14:05:23
It is an ETN.

@_date: 2015-09-13 13:37:21
Bitstamp has applied for Bitlicense... Also they are under UK regulators. 
Bitstamp, Itbit, Coinbase, Coinsetter, Kraken, Bitcoin.de... Those are fine :) I wouldn't trade on other exchanges. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 20:55:52
If you're not PRO forex trader then buying bitcoin is much better idea. If you're doing that as 5 year investment you need to know that two halvings will happen in that time... So yes, buy and hold for next 5 years. If you buy btc now you will probably make some nice profits in 5 years.
@_date: 2015-09-30 15:40:03
Btw. I sure would keep some bitcoins... After all, halving is only 43 weeks away ;) 
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:19:00
Yep. Also if you do it right you can even make some profit... 
@_date: 2015-09-02 16:29:36
True... But I still believe that the industry could do more.
@_date: 2015-09-30 15:26:43
Community is on the lowest level atm. Currently Bitcoin is not interesting to many because the price is low. Because the price is low Bitcoin spending is low and because the spending is low startups can't grow.

With current community... No where. 
 - devs are acting like children
 - miners are only milking out the $
 - exchanges are manipulating the market
 - greedy traders are willing to short this to 0$ just to get more btc
 - (black) markets are dying because they get hacked or owners run away with btc
 - startups are only looking how to get funding to survive for for a year or two and milk VC
 - early adopters are enjoying on their yachts and slowly cashing this out
Bitcoin ecosystem is without any plan how to push this thing forward, because community is not working together. There is a lot of meetings, conferences and so... But we haven't seen any progress in last two years. And with progress I don't mean the price. 
Bitcoin community use to be something, but now...
@_date: 2015-09-04 08:03:55
I have a crypto start up yes... working on automated trading. Also we ordered one ATM.
@_date: 2015-09-23 07:47:06
Because the price is low. Many bought btc well above 300$ and they are waiting. Say thanks to manipulator who get us so low. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 13:11:36
You forgot on something... Bitcoin difficulty is going up so it is much harder to mine new bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:35:31
Then find 2 exchanges... one in Brasil and one in Europe with GBP withdraw option.
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:48:25
Maybe this: 
@_date: 2015-09-25 21:33:18
Hah, true :) 
@_date: 2015-09-01 11:25:56
Buy 0.96 btc and store that 1 btc for next 5 years... 
@_date: 2016-10-10 20:44:35
She can try to connect with bitcoin community near the city she lives and where she wants to send money? I'm sure she can find some on social media, etc. Also look for bitcoin ATMs or simply create account on one of bitcoin exchanges.
Check also localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2016-10-20 23:12:33
Bitstamp, Itbit, Gemini...
@_date: 2015-09-29 13:39:07
Coinfloor, CoinCoirner, Kraken (low volume, but it has low fees if you set a limit order). Check them all. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:20:41
 (or simply use Itbit exchange... or Gemini - which has daily auctions also).
Edit: I'm sure bitcoiners in NY have some weekly meetups, maybe some will be willing to sell... LocalBitcoins is also an option.
@_date: 2016-10-18 10:49:58
Coinbase vault? 
@_date: 2015-09-25 21:40:46
If you look at: blockchain.info/pools you can see miners. We know that KNC sells themevery two weeks (or something), Bitfury also something similar, 21 inc is holding them, BTCC is packing them in 1000 btc per wallet (all coins are still in those new wallets - probably holding as well)... Can't tell much for other pools/miners. 
Price will go up because: more people/institutions will use bitcoin and the supply will reduce. You don't need to be a genius to find out that (it was the same at first halving). 
@_date: 2016-10-04 12:56:07
Yep, shit gets real when B. Gross starts talking about it :)
Btw. Next SEC decisions on bitcoin ETFs: Coin 12.10, SolidX 31.10... 
@_date: 2015-09-25 16:39:24
Funny... they said the same for first halving. If you were around at that time then you should know what I'm talking about, if not then I think you should google about it.
@_date: 2016-10-06 10:56:58
@_date: 2016-10-05 16:20:11
Unless you have free or very cheap electricity I doubt it is worth mining... Rather buy bitcoin and wait. For wallets: bitcoin.org
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:15:46
Finally... All big companies are only sucking out $ from bitcoin system for now. Those companies should do more for promoting and developing bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-03 17:51:06
Maybe you can start the same business? ;)
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:37:22
They are the biggest for BTC/€ pair and not what you wrote.
@_date: 2016-10-27 18:18:58
I'm waiting for 6h now... just because some exchange in cheap on fees (0.0003btc),
@_date: 2015-09-13 13:38:12
Localbitcoins maybe? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:21:53
Buy as much btc as you can now and use them later for OTC trading. Profit.
@_date: 2015-09-21 19:48:11
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:54:07
Yeah! Cashila was the best, then I was also forces to check Bitwala. Was using them until they suspended that service, was waiting for them to get back with that but somehow they don't :) So alternative needed... Bitbill looks solid? Are they reliable for 1000€+ transactions? 
@_date: 2016-10-02 23:07:53
Anyone, if you use bitcoin credit card :)
@_date: 2016-10-18 10:42:15
Circle or Bitstamp. Both has credit card option... But I would go with Bitstamp for bigger buys with international/SEPA deposit. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 06:58:14
This is big.
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:32:46
29MB mpool... This will take few days to clear up! Devs?
@_date: 2016-10-03 15:38:33
Question if they will be selling those btc anytime soon.
@_date: 2016-10-18 12:50:14
What? Standard KYC and you can buy with credit cards if you can't wait 1 day for SEPA deposit.
@_date: 2016-10-10 18:49:39
30k now...
@_date: 2016-10-27 21:25:05
Circle. Bitstamp... both have credit card option.
@_date: 2016-10-20 23:17:57
They sure know where to put their money! But approval...
@_date: 2015-09-03 19:53:03
Stress test... Those transaction has really low fees so they are not on priority list. If you pay normal fees your transaction won't have any delays.  
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:07:56

If you have a stop loss placed on one solid exchange (Bitstamp, Itbit, Coinbase, Kraken...) then there was not such big risk. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 09:24:26
This... Some are willing to drive this so far that industry will turn away from btc.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:49:30
That amount of open shorts... Market about to punished them.

If Core doesn't go with that, ecosystem should do it on its own. So... Core?

Kraken is US :)
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:17:29
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:58:32
Market is obviously willing to sell more so he will be able to buy in low. 
@_date: 2015-11-01 17:19:48
Must be because of low IQ.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:37:20
If industry agree this will happen. With or without Core.
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:18:46
If anyone, then Barry can get both parts to the consensus. Can we do this without Core?
@_date: 2015-10-11 12:25:36
Btc China is the best, oldest and currently the only Chinese exchange who is not faking the volume. Other exchanges are for gamblers.

Deposits/withdraws (for SEPA) takes 1-2 days. I use Bitstamp and Kraken... never had any problems with them! Also Bitstamp is highly regulated and this is a big +.
If you want to buy without KYC, use bitcoin ATMs or LocalBitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:09:38
According to comments, Bitfury is on board. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 14:29:01
Same problem here... u/jespow

Something similar here... People just need to find out that you don't get rich overnight with bitcoin, but it is a really good long term investment! If you trade the cycles, then it is even better.
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:52:03
I can say that trades are real because I trade on Bitstamp and my orders were filled by that bot for few times now. If the volume is fake then orders shouldn't get filled. Can't say the same for OKcoin because I don't trade there... 
I think that someone is crating himself the volume and the spread for arbitrage trading. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:36:40
If Core would do as they have promised, blocksize debate would be a history right now. They have promised SW+2MB in HK.
@_date: 2015-10-02 15:49:27
I just gave an example. To be fair, when people learn about btc one of the things comes on every ones mind is: let's hold some btc, maybe the value will go up.
Don't get me wrong, I hope they will use it and not hold it. But I'm sure many will put some in cold storage.  
@_date: 2015-10-10 17:44:55
New ATH before the halving. Hype is already starting! 
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:11:58
"This means that all blocks earlier than  or so were probably mined to an unencrypted wallet."
Why unencrypted and how easily can those wallets be hacked with some super computer?

Tell them to get more users so the price hits 1000$ :)

@_date: 2017-05-23 19:15:02
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:34:12
Finally! 
@_date: 2015-10-01 14:00:18
I found it more interesting that the group has 6000+ members! This is actually huge number. Would be interesting to see how many members own at least 1 btc. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 15:25:12
If 1mil of those users decide to hold only 0.1btc, 100k btc would be taken off the market. 
I hope that at least 100k of those users start using btc in everyday life. If that happens then we can start talking about adoption (yes it is a small number but in a year or two this number would go up 10 times). 
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:04:27
SW+2Mb was a consensus... :)
@_date: 2015-10-01 12:35:46
Hold for next 43 weeks (halving)!

To bad. Maybe Stripe or Braintree? 
@_date: 2015-10-01 14:26:44
Even better. Actually the real use of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:16:32
Looking forward! Finally something similar to fx standers? :)
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:44:37
Just wait and try to get some more. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 21:31:39
From 40mil users 1% would be 400k... But as said if only 100k or even only 50k of those users start using btc this would be really good. 
I think this number is realistic if site owners make a good pr. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 07:40:21
Still the volume isn't fake. Fake volume means orders that are not in the orderbooks.

Every crypto veteran can tell you why.
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:41:00
If you will not margin trade then better use Gemini, Gdax or Itbit (all US based).
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:43:27
@_date: 2015-10-10 11:53:07
Why not go with Bitstamp? Volume, reliable, relatively low fees, operating more or less everywhere. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:24:53
You can. But I think the fastes and easiest way to buy btc in Germany is Bitcoin.de.
You can also try localbitcoins.com.
@_date: 2015-10-01 15:49:44
Volume is not fake because other users orders are actually get executed... and for now no one report about btc withdraw problems. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 22:54:14
Exchanges: Bitstamp, Kraken. 
Wallet: Copay.
@_date: 2016-07-29 11:11:46
Localbitcoins. Bitstamp has also buy with credit card option. Gemini exchange offers fast deposits (ACH), but not sure if those works on Sunday...
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:23:25
Best in the business.
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:11:00
Coinbase? Only SW for now.
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:54:50
Way to do it...
@_date: 2019-05-16 09:40:29
VeriBlock is spamming network with non SW tx.
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:48:38

@_date: 2016-07-12 13:50:26
Isn't Stockholm ETN better solution if you're in Europe?
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:55:03
Yeah, really bullish months coming! I will probably bought few btc more, just in case :)
@_date: 2015-10-01 12:34:15
This is gonna be interesting... XBT Provider currently holds more than 15 100 btc. Question here is. Will those two trackers (SEC and EUR) have separated notes (btc funds) or will they need to add new notes for EUR tracker? 
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:51:53

Well... BTC/JPY volume is rising really fast. At least it is real and not fake as BTC/CNY.
@_date: 2015-10-01 13:38:35
They said the same for first halving... 
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:26:46
Countless :)
@_date: 2016-07-12 18:29:33
Winkle etf has 100k btc or 65mil$ ;)
@_date: 2016-07-12 14:00:55
That is true, but XBT Provider ETN is highly regulated... After all it is in under Sweden regulators.
@_date: 2016-07-14 14:54:33
There is more millionaires on the world as current bitcoins in circulation... One way of looking at that. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:23:03

There are always two sides of the medal... We know what industry wants, if they won't get that money will go elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:03:01
Luckily bitcoin is not the only option.
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:51:35
Try Itbit... They probably don't have such backlog.
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:34:59
There was a lot of posts how many business started using other cryptos. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 14:50:46
So this is more or less the same as XBT Provider ETN?
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:54:24
 
Contact them... maybe you will get the deal without physical coins ;)

SW adoption is stagnating... This has to change before new bullrun otherwise fees will skyrocket again.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:33:58
Because they think they know what is best for bitcoin... 100$ fee is ok, according to some.

@_date: 2017-06-12 15:47:53
To hard for core I guess... 100$ fee is ok for them.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:43:11
For spot usd trading I would rather advise Bitstamp or Itbit. Both highly regulated and have better stop orders. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:54:32

@_date: 2017-06-12 14:59:10
Kraken, Bitfinex, Bitmex, OKcoin futures, 1broker and hopefully Bitstamp in 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:27:56
SW+2MB would solve everything for next 2-3 years and give time to find right solutions. SW solves problems only for 1 year maybe. We will have same stupid problems in next years.

Bitstamp, Gdax, Gemini, Itbit.
@_date: 2016-07-13 13:03:21
There is still a big difference between OKcoin and Huobi wash volume and real volume (BTCC for example). 
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:04:43
