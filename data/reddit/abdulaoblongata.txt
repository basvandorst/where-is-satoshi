That works great. But would still like an address book to use with non-pheeva users.  Also have you thought about allowing other wallets to implement your coin ID

We have several Reeds Jewelers here in southern NC.  So I wouldn't say it's only northeast.

Thanks for the reply but I don't understand.  Why can't the local wallet detect and use a standard address?  I'm not a developer but for a wallet to succeed it seems to me that it to work with other bitcoin apps.

Do you guys have plans on implementing a saved contacts list so that the users don't have to enter an address or scan a QR code for every transaction?

This is the exactly why I want Bitcoin.  Take control away from the government, not give them more.  The government has no authority to tell a company that they have to give paid vacations to employees.  All this is going to do is force prices to go up to cover the extra business' expenses hurting the poorest consumers first.
Edit:  No obviously it isn't as simple as a 3 sentence reply.  Wages should be paid at market price and increasing the minimum wage pushes up prices, causing inflation and hurting poor people even more.  There will always be people who are less fortunate than others but the government can't fix this.  Only real free trade where it's not profitable for businesses to buy off politicians will allow the poor to prosper.  Bitcoin has a real shot at ending the government monopoly on currency which could make this possible.  If the government doesn't have the  power to steal from its citizens then the people will truly have control over their country.  This cronyism that we see today is not rule by the people but rule by the banks.

Just to be clear, if i have the app installed already can I go download the Apple Store version and keep my same wallet.  I don't want to lose my funds as this is my primary hot wallet

What OS are you referring too?  All of the other wallet applications understand a simple address fine, however they do not understand the URI.

I'm trying to scan the address QR code with another app and it says "please provide a valid bitcoin address."  I assume this is because in Green Address the QR code is generated off of "bitcoin:" then the address.  Any suggestions on how to transact between other wallets and Green Address?
Edit*  The QR code is for the Bitcoin URI not simply the address.  What exactly does the URI do?

I am not sure if I can run it, but I'll look into running this on Linux.  I'm new to Linux and I am not a programer so I will have to research this more.  Thanks

This needs to be higher up.  Dodd-Frank needs to be thrown in the trash and banks don't need to be bailed out.  Part of the subprime lending bubble was due to equal housing lender requirements making it hard to deny risky loans out of fear of discrimination suits.  I'm not sure why people are complaining about removal of regulation if they like Bitcoin since non of these regulations apply.

Not the point of Bitcoin.  This just reinforces all the naysayers who claim its a ponzi scheme
