Thank you for the clear, concise introduction to bitcoin. Everytime I bring it up, my family members give me blank stares. I don't have the btc-related competency to give such an explanation myself (definitely new to the game - I had the option of a payout from an online transaction in bitcoin aw while back and thought "why not!"....similar to your story but only about 1/100th the amount). I am going to share this to my facebook to give friends/family an idea of what it is when I bring it up.
I recently diversified a little bit opting to take a small amount of LTC. One thing is for certain: I am now concentrating on obtaining more crypto rather than selling it off when I "need" fiat currency.  I hold about a fifth of what I once owned in btc and it is worth now about twice as much as that original amount. Your lottery analogy is apt. Now I have to take act on the premise of the tree analogy :)
Thank you for your time and effort, young sir.

This post is wrong in so many ways. You really think Peterson is in need of money?  The guy has a bestselling book, sells out large auditoriums for talks, has enormously popular Youtube channel, etc etc etc. In addition to having been very successful in the world of academia (prof with tenure a top university) and a successful private psychology practice.
And even if he were in need of money, why be so prude and unwelcoming? Bitcoin/crypto can definitely use more public figures like this.
