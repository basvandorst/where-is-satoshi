And now I just refreshed it and a new transaction showed up of somebody sending me the approx same amount of BTC again. I emailed the company so maybe the cancelled and redid the transaction? didnt know you could do that

maybe it's just a blockchain glitch because it's been pending so long though because another transaction i had that's been blocked up cause of this fiasco also did the same thing

I assume it's probably got something to do with fast-rising BTC exchange rates? probably alot of server activity or something. Anyways this is getting really irritating. And I checked and the BTC ATM used a pretty high fee which makes it weird that the transfer is still pending
EDIT: Now that I'm looking back, the fee is actually about half of the fees blockchain uses when sending money to another wallet and much much lower than the fees other ATMs use which may have something to do with it. Any way I can raise the fees retroactively?

ah. yeah im pretty sure its a problem with the fees the machine used, which were only like 38.88 sat/B oddly, when it seems most machines are using closer to the 65-70 range or even higher sometimes. Idk how i can get the fees to raise retroactively tho (probably can't) but im worried that the transaction will stay in limbo forever or until it expires, at which point I'll probably lose my money because I put it into the machine.
sorry I'm just anxious rn cause its been over 26 hours and idk how long blockchain lets the transaction remain in limbo for

were you using blockchain also? thats comforting i guess, hopefully it'll get resolved before the transaction times out or something. I guess it's just a waiting game now (deposited it yesterday at around 3pm and its almost 2:30 now)

Well, this isn't good. and very strange. So i've been checking the wallet pretty religiously and the transaction was still pending up till a few hours ago this afternoon (about 2 full days after visiting the ATM). Then about 30 minutes ago I logged back into blockchain to check what the transaction's status was, and i was excited because it said the transaction had been confirmed. Then I realized that the amount was off, and the date said Feb. 1st not 20th, so it was just showing me my most recent BTC purchase. The transaction where I was buying 450$ worth of BTC seems to have disappeared off my blockchain wallet? I'm very worried now
