Mining has generally become not worth of anybody's time unless you are able to fab your own chips.
I would save the grief of your mining contracts losing value and do something else worthwhile.

This was because mtgox.com/?dead was posted to Hacker News late last night (and a very popular post). The ?dead was appended to prevent HN from recognizing it as a duplicate link (much like reddit does) and redirecting you to a 2-year old post.
The post on HN was originally "Mtgox is dead", but later changed to "Mtgox is offline." Google had indexed it when it was on its original title.

No one is asking for $150 less than the market price. The people holding these positions are forced to sell at market price.

The channel is 
\ usually signifies an official channel. In this case, mtgox-chat is not an official channel of mtgox, unlike  which is closed for the time being.

No, because once you transfer funds to an address MtGox gives you, those funds are used to pay the withdrawals of other customers.
This is called fungibility.

This will not happen.

Well, MtGox was the largest exchange for many years. I don't understand what's conflicting?

Coinbase is ridiculously easy to setup.
BitPay requires you to "apply" for an account; Coinbase does not.
You can get setup within a few minutes.

You need to stop being an idiot. midnightmagic and him were trying to have a discussion while you interjected garbage.
Message him privately or change your hostname.

You should realize that humans are inherently stupid. Calling this individual out is naive; many others will make similar mistakes.
Bitcoin makes these mistakes incredibly easy to make, and incredibly costly.
When such a mistake is incredibly easy to make, soon enough it becomes an issue against Bitcoin itself.

You've just described the reason why most of are into Bitcoin.
You're afraid you won't make any money in _USD_, when in fact Bitcoin will be perfectly be fine and work the same if it is worth $100 USD or $1000.

I want to know your thought process when you posted this.
There is nothing that can directly do to help you regain access to your account.
What you could do is contact Kraken support and see how they can help resolve your issue.

It wasn't a short amount of time. MtGox said it was over the course of several years.
Where many people are disinterested is that transaction malleability was not limited to MtGox's implementation of Bitcoin. The reference client (Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind) was also affected, however its reliability on txids were not as much to cause loss of funds.
It's certain that they did lose some funds to this, but the figures they give are just insane. I'll explain the technical details.
When MtGox sends a tx to an address, it keeps check on it to make sure it's accepted by the network.
However, transaction malleability allows for an attacker to immediately send the same tx, but with a different id. If the attacker does it fast enough, he can get his tx accepted into the network.
MtGox's tx appears to be a double spend to the network (using the same inputs), so MtGox detects this and resends the same amount to the address using new inputs.
Rinse and repeat until you're out of funds. Bitcoin-Qt did not have this problem because it used the same inputs to send the transaction. If the attacker's tx goes through, the inputs used would make the resent tx invalid.

Well that sure gives some insight of the type of "exchanges" that appear in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
