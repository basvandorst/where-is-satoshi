Gotta lock in profit somehow...
In a way I don't mind, because they might be buyers at a higher price later down the track when *you* want to sell.

Pretty much. Everytime I see a facebook or youtube ad for an ICO it pretty much tells me to never invest in that ICO.
A good project will speak for itself and doesn't need shitty facebook ads to bring in dumb money

It's about (a) the practicality of FIAT and the notion that you know what you are worth.
When I look at my savings I see 1k. 
Five days later it's 1k.
Two months later it's still 1k...
When I look at my bitcoin it might be 1k...
Next week it's $700.
Next week it's $1500
Next week it's $1100
Next week it might be $900.
Holding bitcoin instead of FIAT is something for the financially secure/already well off person. 
An ordinary person has no reason to do this. Imagine if you had bills to pay and you could afford them three days ago, but today bitcoin dipped and now you can't? 
Or you put your pay into bitcoin one week and the next week it drops, meaning you essentially got paid less for your time at work.  
etc 
etc

I don't even understand why people are buying it on bittrex in the first place. It's significantly cheaper on many other exchanges. If people really wanted it they would go elsewhere.
Price of BCC as I post this:
Bittrex - $889
Kraken - $577
Bitfinex - $434
Sell your BCC on Bittrex, Move your BTC to Bitfinex or Kraken and but your BCC there. Why somebody would pay so much for BCC right now is beyond me.

Strange I've never seen tax where you pay a lump sum +  a percentage. Speaking as an Australian. 
Why not just raise the percentages of the brackets?

You sound so reasonable 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:37:55
Yes. I feel like I'm going mad here sometimes.

actually I know for a fact that he had an enormous beard. *enormous*

Not really. Bittrex includes fees when you buy so if you buy 10,000 of something you get 10,000. All my holdings are nice round numbers it's nothing unusual

Sorry but the age of the account tells you nothing about the person commenting. 
There's plenty of knowledgeable people with throwaway accounts and there's plenty of shitkickers that spam everywhere.

geez man when I was in school me and my mates were lucky to have $20 to throw at something like this.
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:50:03
Yeah this thread honestly panics me

Buying bitcoin isn't something people do when they need money to buy commodities.
Buying bitcoin is something for people who have spare money to invest.
At the moment we don't have Mr average Joe Bloe being paid with bitcoin to buy commodities with bitcoin.

The only comparison here would be the investing subreddit

Total in circulation will actually be significantly less than 21 million. I think when all is said and done probably 20% of BTC is forever lost to the void of lost passwords and destroyed hardware.

A lot of alt coins aren't even "currencies" they are utilities in new business models. They can be traded as a currency but that's not the primary intention.

You wont use HODL meme but 'to the moom' meme is ok lol

There's a lot of delusion, or perhaps it's just a misunderstanding, about the actual usefulness of bitcoin. 
It's very frustrating and it's not healthy for the community.
