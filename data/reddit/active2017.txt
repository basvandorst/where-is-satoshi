We get it, you're smarter than us.
@_date: 2016-06-23 14:15:33
I'm not freaking out. Bought some at $250 and $650. Only down $30.
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:23:05
Just sent an email. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:31:04
Is this the correct link to do that? 
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:10:57
No

Tesla doesn't make SRTs ;) 
But no I'm too poor for that shit):
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:13:28
My 300 is definitely a step up in terms of quality from a Tesla. It's obviously not as luxurious as a bimmer or Mercedes, but it's still above average.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:54:13
Tesla can't beat me if it's on a tow truck ;)
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:52:26
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:42:24
Lol not even close. I like Tesla, but the interior feels like a Ford Focus.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:33:59

How is the sky the limit when Bitcoin is on the moon?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:11:29
guys someone help my autopilot isn't working
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:47:25
I'd wager that anyone who parades their quality has never actually driven one. In terms of being such a young company, sure their quality is good, but compared to other car manufacturers it's not. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:40:39
No it was literally as an option. They used the same battery in higher capacity models to cut costs. Kinda agree with it, kinda on the fence.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:13:50
Less car = more btc to hodl 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:51:22
Allow me to introduce you to my friend. They shit on Bitcoin, but it's a great place for financial advice.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:53:06
My parents had an '06 300 and the interior was absolute shit. I like mine though.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:46:27
But most people already discredit them because of those years so their current products are under appreciated
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:18:42
Just remember, people were waiting for a dip at $1,200... and $4500... and $6600 etc.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:38:02
Assuming this story isn't fake, I think the first thing you guys need is some heavy financial education. No savings, making $55-75k a year and you're looking to buy a $350k house?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:11:19
Deleted, my bad
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:15:52
You're trying too hard 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:04:54
It's the only way I know
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:41:26
'Murica 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:24:59
Yeah they made like a 70 kw/h battery and limited the capacity to like 60 kw/h or something like that. Numbers are probably wrong
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:36:09
I named this hard fork the Tesla model 300
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:02:16
You're commenting on that post haha...ha
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:32:24
If you can't afford to lose $200, you probably shouldn't be investing yet
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:31:29
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Elon the Wise?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:39:10
is that a party hat

How was the coffee?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:12:06
Jesus Christ the thought of EA making a car terrifies me
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:23:40
Arguably the only true good product they make. Especially for the value. Price of a 328i with twice the features? Don't mind if I do.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:17:32
post, shit quality 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:17:18
Not yet.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:04:25
Now post a picture of your Tesla with a drawn Chrysler logo... double the karma if you paint it on the steering wheel
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:39:47
Huh TIL. I'm a Chrysler fanboy and I didn't know Fiat owned Ferrari. Or maybe I did and I forgot ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:22:52
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:23:57
Oh well uh... I didn't think the big three would tell you that one
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:40:33
I hear the delivery of this model will be sped up and you should have one in only 2 years!
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:05:46
I thought of it and kinda blew air out my nose and called myself a retard
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:12:41
Fiat doesn't own Tesla? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:13:01
Yes sir! 2013 w/ a hemi
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:50:43
I guess you're right about the features. Really it's just that you're getting a bigger car for the same price and (in my opinion) nearly the same quality. In terms of drive quality, the bmw wins against the majority of cars. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:14:30
A base 328i vs a base 300 is what I was talking about. And if you spend $50k on a 300, you could've gotten the SRT a couple years back which kicks the fuck out of any 328
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:05:01
Oh yeah? Well I remember when Bitcoin was $-1,000 and I laughed at anyone who bought it
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:52:49
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:03:49
My car isn't actually a Tesla
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:43:22
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:12:48
I'm also in the dark
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:45:28
Might wanna reload those prices...
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:51:53
I didn't downvote, I agree it's definitely unusual, still holding

@_date: 2017-10-13 02:46:42
HODL... seriously don't try to time it. I sold two bitcoins at the "high" of like 1,000 and bought back in when it dipped to $3,800
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:37:51
I'm constantly tempted to drain my Roth and just put it into Bitcoin. Not that it'd be that much but still
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:34:37
Lemme go get my crystal ball real quick and I'll do that.

Gold is dropping at the same time bitcoin is going up ��
