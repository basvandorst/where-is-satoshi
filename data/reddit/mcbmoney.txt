Apologies for the link, I'm on a mobile

Yeah, that's really weird. I'm not sure what the issue is. If I follow the link it re-directs me, if I type it in by hand it gets me there. I dunno man, sorry.

This is probably a dumb question, but was the deal with the 51% controversy a while back. From what I could glean if 51% of transactions passed through a single processor the block chain was susceptible to manipulation. Was that the case, and if so how was that possible?

You've got PayPal Payments Pro, you're not going to see Bitcoin as an option there (as of now). Bitcoin is an option for you if you're using the PayPal Payments Hub. I submitted a link above which has a walk through of getting set up for the hub. Weirdly you can't click it, but if you type in the link in a new tab it should pop up for you, hope this helps.

Thanks for the tips. Is there a darkside to coinbase I haven't heard of?

I also got this email, very cool. What do the other comments mean by chosen four?

Ah, haha. There are dozens of us, dozens!

You can call in and see if they can waive them. I work for $PaymentProcessor and waive them all the time. It for sure sucks, if memory serves, credit card companies charge them and the cost is passed on. Hope this helps!
