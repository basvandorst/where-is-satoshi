In the bitcoin space, name them.  I'm not lying at all.  Just list what they currently do for a bitcoin exchange.  Maybe I'm not seeing something.  Please also site sources so I can investigate.  Thank you.

People actually don't.  They don't want to see the early adopters do so well.  They have no clue how rigged the system is now.  
They don't care as long as it's not people like themselves that did really well while they didn't have as much success.

Read scenario below.  The whole point of this mental exercise is to show that bitcoin will NEVER reach zero.  You cannot do what you just said hypothetically.  Most people now would pay the dollar I believe and this is why it will never get to zero again and ultimately why it will continue to grow.  People will always be willing to pay incrementally higher amounts over time.

I actually like those guys.  They created Facebook, it was stolen and then they get in early on bitcoin.  Plus they competed in the olympics and could kick 99% of everyone's asses here.  
I think we've bought into media hype about those guys being sorta lame but the truth is they keep getting real damn close to incredible success and most people would be very happy with the success they have had.
It's funny how we cheer a fucking criminal like Zuckerberg.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:05:43
I'll go ahead and key you in on the point too because I'm CERTAIN that will slip by you as well.  Most people now, in this situation would absolutely pay 1 dollar for 1 bitcoin if that's all they could get regardless of how low it was for others.  This perception of innate value now is why bitcoin will NEVER drop to zero and will work as a currency in the long run.  It now has innate mass psychological value based on past performance.

This really is a good article.  The comparison of backers that are movers and shakers to detractors that stand to lose if bitcoin succeeds is apt.

I ABSOLUTELY do not respect their degrees or their experience.  I loathe it.  The fractional reserve system we have is the biggest scam known to man and is holding humanity itself back.  It creates a class system that can be maintained forever just by printing money and giving it to their friends.  
Running software??  Many of these people were coding and experimenting with the software they ran.  Do you know how to write and compile c++ code.  Do you know how to optimize it using opencl on video cards that aren't standardized?  I'm just curious.
You are embarrassing yourself.

What don't you understand?  **Your** only option is to buy it at 1 dollar.  Plenty of people can buy it for less but **you** cannot.  Would you or would you not?

IT IS FEAR.  Regulators are creating an environment of fear.  The banks fear being penalized.  They don't care about bitcoin.
Why do you think the regulators are creating this environment?  It has NOTHING to do with regulation, which should be things like proper cold storage reserves, 2FA, etc, etc.   Regulators really don't give a shit about regulating.  Most government workers are this way.  They want a paycheck.  Their strings are being pulled by central banks.  That is the bottom line.  Otherwise, they wouldn't even act.  The citizens certainly aren't telling them to act and I can tell you they would in no way act on their own.
Money talks and someone is motivating them with that or the lack of that.

Also your characterization of one group as being "professional" and another group having "ran a computer for a couple hours in 2009" is what I'm basing my jealousy statement on.
In 2009 the tools to mine were nowhere near as easy to use as they are now and there was very little help.  Personally I'd say that group was far more skilled than the ones you call professionals.

I don't think average users should use bitcoin-qt.  There's no need to download the entire blockchain.  Wouldn't it be best to just get electrum and send your coins to a receive address there, backup the wallet file and seed and be done?

They should change their FAQ immediately.  They left out a prefix:  (in)secure servers  
Q: Where will my bitcoins go?  
A: Bitcoins deposited with flexcoin will be stored on our ~~secure~~ servers. They will remain in your account, and your account only, unless you authorize a transaction with them.

Dude...you're so jealous.  I hope they do have trillions personally.  I think they deserve it.  It is still FAR more fair than having a system where one group of "professionals" can print as much as they like and spend it in the way they like based on policies they create.  
I think the common thought is one group may hold 1% of all bitcoins.  I'll take that ANY DAY!

Let me attempt to clear this up for people having trouble.  Let's assume the price of bitcoin is zero.  People freely give it to one another for an unknown to you duration because you are locked up in a prison with no communication to the outside world besides one guard.  This guard offers to give you 100 bitcoins for 100 dollars.  You feel confident the price has gone to zero because the guard also shows you a newspaper with the headline Bitcoin drops to Zero!

Looks like I need to shut my big mouth.  Thanks for the info.  
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:42:41
I would be all for that if what you are saying were true.  It is not.  These "regulators" are not interested in ensuring people get their money back under various circumstances. They are only interested in having people pay for bitlicenses and other such non-sense.  If you've read ANY language to the contrary then please post it here so we know the specifics.
Also, saying the government is not involved in greasing palms is naive.  This happens on a continuous basis and is pretty much what the American government is all about.  Sure, at the individual regulator level this wouldn't be the case--middle management.   At the top though, I'm pretty sure folks are only acting on bitcoin because there is a LOT of money at stake.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:28:26
Someone should ask him if the intent with regulation is to protect the consumer why don't they aim for compliance of best practices rather than making folks pay millions for licenses.  
It seems more like they are trying to slow the flow of value into bitcoin instead of protect consumers.

It impacts the whole system.  It impacts fractional reserve banking itself.  It impacts the value central banks have in creating money to pay for government securities and loans to other banks.
When you no longer need or want fiat, it becomes a useless system.  The "mirage" is the belief that a central organization can create money forever at will and that money retain it's value--especially when confronted by something as equitable as bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:26:28
The point is even if it dropped to zero, people would still pay 1 dollar for it if that were there only option.  This is why it will never drop to zero and this is why bitcoin will become a world wide currency.
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:09:06
Not at all.  I am happy for them.  Let's see them create more as they spend what they have and DESERVE now.

Personally I think you may be right.  I'm not saying bitcoin is perfect.  However, the truth is, when the early adopters spend their bitcoins, they can't just create more as easily.  It is FAR more fair than our current system.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:16:05
It's called speculation there goober.  Do you think the price of bitcoin started at 700 bucks?  It started at zero.  So many of those idiots paying for something "worthless" are now quite well off.  Just as today, folks paying 700 bucks will be well off in 10 years.

Only the ones that didn't prepare for it.  Also, they didn't blame the bitcoin protocol.   I tell you what, if it was such a big deal to them and they didn't want to implement the protections the core devs recommended, why not submit patches to the github source code?  Don't complain about a solution offered when you don't want to either a)implement the proposed solution b)create a solution yourself.
In short, they want to scapegoat in an attempt to prolong their company and they don't mind attempting to tarnish the reputation of bitcoin itself while they're at it.

@_date: 2014-03-01 13:45:37
Unfortunately this simply is NOT TRUE.  If this were the case, "regulators" would require cold storage audits, 2FA and other emerging industry best practices.  As it is, they just require you to send in a FAT CHECK that a lot in this space can't afford and pick up your "bitlicense" for just your local state.  
Regulation in the US is currently just extortion.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:00:56
Sure they can.  The price to 99.999% of people is zero.  They get it for nothing.  Not you.

In either of those cases, it wouldn't matter because the blockchain is what matters and the blockchain is pretty well backed up.  You'd have a fork and we'd carry on with business as usual.  This already occurred once and has occurred many times with many alts.  
Any outstanding feature of another alt can easily be incorporated in bitcoin.  Also, bitcoin already has the most and best programmers.  It's like comparing linux to minix or the hurd.

When the government talks about regulation, they aren't talking about ensuring you properly coded for transaction malleability, 2FA, or percentage of cold storage.  The governments version of regulation just means greasing someone's palms.

Perhaps you love Putin as well or that criminal Zuckerburg.  I'm so tired of people idolizing others just because they "win".
If you like that kind of thing, you should just get out of bitcoin.  It's too fair for people.  Instead cheer the Federal Reserve and big banks.
