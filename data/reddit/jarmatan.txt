My sale order has been stuck for almost 3 hours now. After I entered it, I noticed that the order's book was frozen. I can't cancel the order, I can't transfer my bitcoins out, I can do NOTHING. As bad as Kraken, or even worse.
Edit: My order has just been cancelled by itself. Now I don't know If it's safe to enter new orders!

I think you understand money pretty well, as every word you type is basically true. May be you are just not focussing on the details that make the money work. Doing so should be enough to clear your doubds.
As you know, money market price depends on its demand and offer equilibrium. Since it's demanded, it must be for some reason. It must have some kind of utility that gives its value, keeping in mind that any value is subjetive. I mean, if you personaly want to have money, it's because it has an utility for you.
So, what are the utilities of money? Basically three:
1) Reserve of value.
2) Medium to allow the exchange of different goods in a better way than bartering.
3) Measuring the market prices of everything.
Any good that serves correctly those three purposes can be used as money, and anyone can discover its utilities. Then, the more people using it, the better it will serve its purpose as money.
As you have understood by yourself, the "intrinsic" value of the money is a innecesary fantasy. The true value of the money depends on how good is to acomplish it's three main characteristics, no mater if it's a paper, a piece of metal, a shell, or a piece of sheep shit.
In some way, regarding its intrisic value, Bitcoin is even less than any piece of shit, since it even has no fisical existence. It's just some silly numbers in some nerds' computers (rich nerds, nowadays). But it acomplishes very well at least some of the characteristics of good money, and that's more than enough when USD or EUR are becoming so similar to real shit.
