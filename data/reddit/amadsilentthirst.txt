Thanks, but I think you skipped to the end and just read that 
Other question, Hiding in Plain Sight academic Question.
Still it was a long post, so I don't blame you. :), have formatted a bit to help

Good idea, that will give me the entropy security I "think" is needed. (don't like to trust programs to generate own, even if they are using enough - possible infected exe, highly unlikley I know, but money.)
(I didn't put down "all" my storage solutions, I will use paper, and another, but wanted to specifically know if **lastpass secure note would be an online option**, obviously not in plain txt in case of fire burglary etc.)
I did look at BIP's but I don't like encryption for the keys for two reasons, first I'd be more lax about how many paper copies I had about, secondly I really would forget the password, or even die and not have my family be able to recover it.
But yes totally agree it's a great option to have and most should.
(I didn't know about Special passphrase in Bib39 thats kind of neat, like an encrypted volume in your encrypted volume.) - Thanks

I know what you're getting at, but I have a few ideas like that, and intend to use them for playing, ie hiding small bits of coin as a game/reward for family members, and also to better understand what is truly random. As well as that stealing under stress thing. 
Probably should not have put that in the same post as bitcoin security question, now I think about it.
Absolutely agree with the simple approach, and thought I was going far down that route by bypassing wallets for cold storage.
It seems your main concerns are BIP39 and the Quantum Mechanics Prediction of fluctiation in a vacuum, the later of which I'm more likely accept than CSPRNG which is only a **pseudo** -random number not a TRNG  Papers.
I know it was only published recently. 
TRN was going to be casino dice and a wordlist This Quantum thing seemed much better.
I realise pseudo numbers may be kinda random, but when basing the entirety of no one else ever causing a collision, as well as trusting the exe and browser etc. I'd just prefer to go with a TRNG. (was hoping the using several blocks of that randomness and then altering it, it was 100% random and also secure from any browser captures or clipboard hacks etc)
Anyway, thanks for the chat, my funds are still in Armory Offline and paperbackup for that at present, but the space is needed, and really hate that program now, so got to move soon. 
Will take what you said and do some more research  if there is a way to incorporate encrypted keys into my procedure, without it causing more issue than it solves I will.
Hrm maybe a zen garden where the space between the sand groves is the number of words in a self made ebook where the seed key starts....or half a key inlayed into the top of my Teabox only readable in a mirror under uv light.....

Oh in that case I apologise.
Just looked through your previous..
So you'd probably recommend Trezor or other hardware wallet, for storage.
Yep, don't really want to use hardware wallets, or any wallets for offline storage really, as that just makes it more points of failure and trust avenues. 
Wallets come and go and you are dependant on them to a certain degree, look at Armory for instance, which I use at present. I had to find a valid exe, hope it was fine, couldn't get keys out of it without creating an online watching version, which meant 20hours and 130GB data. Despite it being continued, forked whatever if I had waited another 5 years who knows if I could even get the Btc out.
Was going to use Electrum offline with online watching, but didn't like the entropy they used, or the risk of a developer going rouge. didn't see a way to add my own randomness to the key generation, although seems there is, but still other concerns.
You have to be aware of how wallets work, how change address work sweeping and importing differences etc.  
At it's base level it's just a keyPair the more complexity you add, while gaining convenience, you lose accountability and security.
My goal is for 10+ years storage of keys, with difficult but secure access at that time, without worrying about wallets and developers.
If there is a safer way to generate a key pair offline, by all means let me know and Arigatōgozaimashita for the advice, but your other posts don't come across well.
