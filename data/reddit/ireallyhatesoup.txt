Did you just lose the hard drive? Misplace it?

All my BTC are held on my Ledger Nano in a normal Bitcoin address. I don't really plan on moving them from there, at all. Is there much point In me setting up a and transferring to a segwit address?
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:38:11
Ok thanks. Is there any possible problem if it is the legacy wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:27:43
Is there a way I can browse the app before I purchase it? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:48:14
ok thanks
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:01:56
I’ll probably give it a miss then. Knowing my luck I’d somehow manage to mess it up and be left with nothing ��
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:42:03
My BTC are on my ledger nano. When I set it up it asked what wallet id prefer, I just clicked "I don't know". Does anyone know what the default one is?
@_date: 2019-07-01 01:52:05
What chart you looking at?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:22:53
Oh yeah. Ok thanks

Surprised Preev isn't listed here. Is it not a respected site?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:41:30
Ah I see, gotcha. Do you know where Preev get their price from? It seems to vary quite a lot compared to other sites
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:29:21
My understanding is that coinbase and gdax are the same company, there are no fees on gdax and you can transfer from your coinbase wallet to your gdax one for free too. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:46:43
Give up. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:55:25
So theoretically this could still be manipulated?? I was under the impression it stopped for the day.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:57:27
"some reason" seems a bit vague. What is it theyre asking for ID wise?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:58:48
Dress up like a chick, then head to Girls Gone Bitcoin.

I never wiped and restored when I got mine. Am I right in saying the purpose is purely to make sure you have the recovery seed words written down correctly?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:46:18
If you follow the DCA method, how do you work out what your average rate is?
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:52:23
Interesting. Thanks for the links, look forward to reading up on this!

I’m on my mobile and never realised how big the paragraph was. Thankfully I gave up about a quarter of the way when I read the OP state that he had “started to recognise patterns” 3 months ago and since then he has been able “accurately” predict the markets. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:53:46
Great to see more and more places accepting Bitcoin. Excuse my ignorance here now, but why would they offer a 20% discount for bitcoin purchased? What benefits are there that make up for a deduction of  FIFTH of what would normally be received?
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:14:59
Yeah, what the fuck? I'm pretty sure I would have seen that when I was researching what wallet to buy. 
How could this affect our security?
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:55:34
So where would they go to sell?
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:34:37
I bought at ATH ������
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:52:16
Care to share? Or maybe provide a link? 
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:32:22
Not entirely true. This market for example, its quite obscure and I doubt any other bookie offers it. Once betway (the bookie in question here) put it up they would have priced it up on their own belief. Only then could public opinion (ie what they bet on) affect the odds
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:22:00
If yo believed the bookies are never wrong, then the 20/1 on it being less than a dollar any point this year should be terrifying you. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 11:02:05
By scrolling through all your previous posts. There will be some Redditors that have maybe posted slight bits of info here and there that, without realising it, could help someone with sinister motives to identify you.
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:05:37
ok well could you give me an idea as to what you were going to advise? All im trying to do is add a bitcoin address to my portfolio app, however im not sure where to find it! Any address ive used in the past to receive a transaction is empty and im not sure how to get one address that shows my full balance.
@_date: 2018-11-13 01:39:16
u/adriskoah How do you think they got your number? Would be interesting to find out how someone involved in crypto’s telephone number ended up in the wrong hands 
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:23:42
Yes mate, I guess I didn’t explain it properly. So how would I go about finding this address? Thanks 
@_date: 2018-11-13 04:12:35
Doesn’t worry you cause you’re smart enough to recognise it being bogus....it should worry you how they got it. Imo of course. It’s not like they called a random number hoping for a gullible grandma to give out her bank details....they specially targeted you because you are involved in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 00:48:55
it was from ledger nano
@_date: 2018-11-19 00:44:18
How can I find a single wallet address (and therefore a balance) that incorporates all address' connected to a pub key? 
@_date: 2018-11-13 01:55:23
Could you explain “rehashing” please?
@_date: 2019-01-16 12:57:18
You must be the first person I’ve heard of that actually pays the ransom. So what happened once you paid? They just left and let you be? 
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:52:02
Can confirm. Since discovering crypto I’m now always looking for more way to get rekt

What position will he play for this team called Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:13:35
Hi could you explain that to me please? How does that work?
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:49:58
Looking forward to your technical analysis. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:50:03
Very well done. 
Ive been saving for years for a deposit on a house, have roughly £20,000. I actually hate myself for not using the whole lot to buy Bitcoin. What makes it worse is that I'm not new to the currency, ive been purchasing small amounts (without holding) for over a year now. 
If I was you though, my recommendation would be to cash out the full initial investment. You've then basically got $10,000 FREE Bitcoin. No matter what happens after that, you've not lost anything. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:16:40
Agreed. I’d ditch bread wallet.....I’m not using it again 
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:36:00
I’m guessing very, if he’s still hurting over it after 2 years.
