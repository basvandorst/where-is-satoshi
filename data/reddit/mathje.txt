Have they solved your issue already?
My latest deposit has been put "On Hold" too, also Tier 3. Deposited many times before from the same bank account without any problems (and definitely not over any limit).
My guess is that they put it "On Hold" for depositing the same amount a couple of times (as their FAQ states that could trigger On Hold), but what the heck? I never expected I could not transfer the same amount to them multiple times...
(This just happened, so they might still solve it quickly, but since I have been victim to the Bittrex account downgrade drama recently, I am terrified...)

Sorry to hear that. Although the kraken website has had issues for quite some time now, I believe support usually is still good at Kraken.
Meanwhile my "On Hold" issue was solved (not sure if that happened in reply to the support ticket or not).
Hopefully Kraken fixes your issue soon too. Good luck!

I had the same issue, but got a reply, and enhanched verification, after about three weeks. So there is still hope for you too, I guess.
I currently still don't use their service though, as the name mismatch problem is not solved, and I am afraid they will freeze my funds again at some point... I think I give it another shot when their support is back on track, if that ever happens.
It's a sad story, I have been quite happy with Bittrex for years.
Have you already visited r/bittrex ? There are many posts by Bittrex victims there with similar issues.

Lol, exactly what I was thinking.
