I have 3 wallet, the one I am using the most actually is Blockchain, but some services for some reason do not integrate with Blockchain wallet so I had to use bitcoin

Watch second video, it explains, the video are made daily and I did not had the capacity to upload it all. I bumped into a lady that had bitcoin. She said the same as you that I wouldn’t be able but that she would happily  accept that I pay her in bitcoin to come with me and let me pass, she did not download a wallet she already had it. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:48:16
Just go to a bar that accept it 
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:11:39
Haha yes, but people do not accept bitcoindirectly :) 
@_date: 2018-03-26 07:24:34
Thanks for your feedback, this is just a compilation of people saying go Team Bitcoin, each them have been asked questions around bitcoin and crypto :) 
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:06:34
Probably, although in Asia some places might not accept card.. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:14:29
Haha no money at stake which payment method would you think has a better chance in Asia ? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 07:42:57
Not in Bangkok anymore but send me the name I will definitely go back again :)

Yes very cheap right! We can now buy coffee again without the transaction fee cost being more than the actual coffee price! 
Thank you glad you like it, I’ll share the experience of crypto use in Asia started from Saturday :)

Thank you, the next one coming is Vietnam, but that was a different story and experience than Hong Kong ...

Master... failed you I have... bitcoin did not win this battle, strong was the dark force in Asia.. but not lost is the war... gathering more force I shall for the next race in Europe ��

This trip cost me 0.12584801 spreader in 9 transactions. I’ll re-read this Reddit post in a few years and cry possibly

No sorry, 0.08 pounds, very cheap transaction fee compared to what it has been.

Yes, from Hong Kong to Singapore, starting on March 10th. The payments method competing are: gold, mobile payments, crypto, plastic cards, and cash.

No hotel and flights are the easiest to purchase with bitcoin! Using cheapair, future.travel, you can get it easily, businesses I used Cocotte in Bangkok, the rest were pretty much individuals willing to accept bitcoin in exchanges of various services 
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:28:55
I used the blockchain wallet, no light coin available on it yet, only ether and bitcoin on the mobile one, bitcoin cash on the desktop version. 
Glad you like it :) 
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:40:53
Yes right :) 
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:31:34
I had many many like that, funny was, before he said no, I asked him the question have you heard about bitcoin? And he said yes, and that he wish he had bought some because he would be a millionaire... but when being offered to have some in exchange of buying me a sandwich, he doesn’t take the opportunity... 
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:18:36
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:45:24
No English is not my first language, but it has been a talking point actually. But English or not explaining what bitcoin is to someone who never heard of it is difficult 
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:26:06
Glad you enjoy the video :) 
I did not figure out how to add a description, a link to video and the video on the app. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:18:37
Just use bitcoin, as part of the race, the rule is that I don't touch any other form of payment, so I can't convert it into cash
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:55:55
Haha thank you, if /when I am involved in next races of this type, ( Now i really want to check differences travelling only on bitcoin around every country of the world) I will try this line. 
 I live in Chichester in England, maybe that is what is doing it ? 
Final day today ! No matter if I win or not, I am the first person to cross America only using bitcoin! 
Challenging but not impossible ! 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:18:30
It is not racing at expenses of other, I pay in bitcoin people who will pay in their turn in whatever is accepted by others 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:59:35
Ok so I need, in that order:
- ride from Las Vegas to airport to the helicopter ride
- someone to pay for the ride and accept my bitcoin in exchange, 
- ride to Las Vegas Money 2020 expo once the tour is finished.
Thanks ! 
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:58:34
Agree ! 
I believe BTC's destiny is as a main stream payment system. But for that, education is needed as it had its bad press moment. 
Cryptocurrencies are the future, so we need to start the education now. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:33:52
Thanks ! I am in Denver at the moment, next stop Vegas my competitors are already on their ways I am slightly behind but taking my time to meet bitcoin communities :) 
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:21:31
So everyday, we were given challenges, 
1st one was to travel to Columbus, obtain an Ohio hat and a souvenir from the Jack Nicklaus museum and take a selfie. 
One each day was given
Last one was to take a selfie with the Grand Canyon at the back. 
All these challenges had to be complete to be given points, then when all completed it was a matter of getting to the finishing line first, 
It worked on a point basis, so we get a certain amount of points for each challenges and then points for arrive first, second etc 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:19:34
Fair enough, where about do you live to do this? 
Because even trying privacy not a soul would accept bitcoin unless they had been involved in it before. I am not looking for clickbait here, I am trying to win a race that is organised by Fintech Finance and Money 2020. We are 5 racers with each only one payment method to travel from Toronto to Las Vegas  in 7 days with daily challenges to complete and we document all our experiences. 
The community of people accepting and involved in  bitcoin have been really supportive and this my experience of it. 
If you want bitcoin to become something everyone use, as people I have met want, then communication and communities are necessary. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:23:27
Actually it does not work I have been stuck in Chicago, in a hotel room for the last 20 hours! People here seems to have a very very bad opinion of Bitcoin, even explaining what I do, and that it is part of a race does not work 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:13:16
France ���� 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:30:00
I had someone is Chicago refusing to speak to me because they thought bitcoin is for criminals and how dodgy it... 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:49:52
Expedia, do not accept bitcoin. I have records of the travel agent denying they accept it. Cheapair they do, unfortunately, there are issues with bitcoin that need to be solved and this include the time to process a transaction. What happened on that day and reason why I asked this lady to buy me a flight is that by the time the payment was processed in bitcoin, the fare had increased, and it was too late for me to buy a second one. Similarly for hotel. You have to plan it ahead as you cannot buy a night in the hotel in bitcoin for same day. Which in that race, I had  to. 
The gift cards, they are great, but you essentially load them in bitcoin and pay in dollars. This exercise was to spend directly in bitcoin for a good or service. Making people realise that it is an accepted as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:03:57
Because you mention using ATM and cards etc. I travelled without touching any cash or a card only paying people directly with bitcoin. 
Otherwise I agree with new technology it would have been easy. But if you think about it, it would have been essentially putting $US in the economy. This week it has been $BTC injected into economy. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:46:11

@_date: 2017-10-27 11:03:48
It will and this is just the start. From this race there is many points, advantages and issues with the payment method that I want to address and broadcast to educate people. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:28:43
Not bad timing congratulations !!!! Enjoy every moment ! 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:19:02
Hence why all transactions were made only in bitcoin. No use of cash :) 
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:21:23

@_date: 2017-10-22 23:04:31
I am in Denver, I have a flight now for Vegas tomorrow morning early, so should land at 8 in Vegas, but I need someone to go from airport to the Grand Canyon by helicopter, I have got 0.06752 left atm  is that enough? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:10:34
With time high it will make it easier! I am keen to meet any bitcoin communities on my journey so be in touch ! 
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:58:21
You can get the full race here if you like  
There is both the experience in the US and in Asia, I am currently traveling through SE Asia and recording the experience, to say the least I had some surprise in Vietnam ! 
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:49:32
Contactless, chip and pin, 1$ bills ��, bitcoin and gold 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:31:41
This is where I need someone to buy it in any form of payment they accept for me and i will pay back the person in BTC
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:05:31
I get your point but disagree with it. The market speculate, and we know which people are the most likely to hold it as an asset, because of the the threat it represent to the banks. It is the speculation and holding that threaten its viability as a currency. The people I have met along the way, certainly do not speculate and simply use it for transactions and some even live on it. Does that mean they are fools? No they transact with it because bitcoin is not something to hold contrarily to a share in Apple for example. It is a currency that is spent, and earned, and spent and earned again. 
And yes I have made my way around banks, I have taken out some money out of an economy, powered and controlled by third party to inject it into an economy in which the people have the control. 
Next up, I will certainly do more video touching on what you mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:58:25

Thank you, the race actually ends in Vegas on Tuesday, but I will be back and definitely think of you! 
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:03:33
Ah ok will be careful in future :) 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:57:54
Thanks Xenodata, I have managed to find someone to help me out with an early helicopter tour so I can make my way to the Venetian in Las Vegas ready for the finishing line as early as possible :) 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:44:11
The larger, established markets do not want to see it work, and I can guarantee that from talking to C-levels at Sibos and Money 20/20. To them, they are loosing on it as they do not have control. Bitcoin is the money of the people and until all people are aware of it and recognise it as a genuine currency. A merchant is also essentially a person, by being aware  and seeing people transacting in it, they will eventually accept it themselves, if hundreds of  people were going day after day asking you if you accept bitcoin. Would you not check it out and consider accepting it ? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:47:31
I have not got anything planned, but I am hoping to do the next race from Shanghai to Singapore. If you come by London let me know and we could get a coffee :) 
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:08:53
Just replying to that, the whole point was that I paid for everything and did not rely on the generosity. Same as a you pay your carpenter to undertake work for you on your house, I paid people in exchanges of services. In one of my video I ask for help to the bitcoin community, the same way as you would go on "check a trade" for your carpenter. If that makes sense ? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:59:46
Yes we did it !! 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:59:23
I am unsure, I definitely transferred it for exchange rate that was on my blockchain app. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:52:32
Yes it was, which one is the most secure would you say? 
I used the easiest one to set up personally. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:51:31
For everyone to own it, they need to be educated on it. In America, it was very hard for people to understand that it is not tangible or physical. Hence they really struggle with understanding the concept. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:50:09
The OP? If I pull this out I'll be first person to travel only using directly bitcoin, and this is only possible because of the bitcoin and the community and vision it was built on 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:35:48
The whole purpose of this was to pay directly in bitcoin. She accepted my payment in bitcoin in exchange of a service, the same way your carpenter accept your dollar in exchange of his work and time to build something. 
By accepting my bitcoin, she recognised it as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:25:26
Sorry gone there already, maybe next year for next race �� 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:45:00
Got you ! I will change my line ! Do something for me and by paying you in Bitcoin you'll thank me for being a millionaire in a few years. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:13:57
Thank you &lt;3
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:50:14
There were contactless, chip and pin, gold cash and bitcoin. 
The guy who had gold had more success, people see the value in it. He even exchanges the rest of his gold on the last day after race was finished 
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:31:33
Thanks I will spread the word. The man I met yesterday actually talked about Andrea today I must check out his videos 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:18:41
Thanks ! 
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:02:08
A small race like that is not the finish, but the start of something. Just acknowledging Bitcoin as a payment method is a power in itself. 
There is a huge education to be made everywhere around the world 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:19:01
Thank you ! 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:54:42
Ok, I hope the click bait as you said was worth it. I am trying to upload the rest of the adventure but struggle with wifi. Chicago ended up being an amazing discovery in terms of merchant acceptance 
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:55:37
More with payment method than currencies, traveling with only one payment method is a challenge. And these challenges are different from a country to another. 
However, with bitcoin, I expect challenges to be fairly similar anywhere until merchants accept it
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:58:15
Totally agree, if you push enough, you would even be surprised of how many would genuinely start accepting it :) 
What is the most ridiculous excuse you got for not accepting it? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:29:36
True the challenge has really been to find middle man who would be willing to accept the bitcoin. It is so hard for people to understand what exactly it is and see value into it. 
So far so good, I found a shop that accepted bitcoin, in Evanston, directly which I went to and interview them. Amazing people who have been a great help. 
I hope with this people will realise that one day, there won't be a middle man, people will be able to accept payments anytime anywhere from anyone and make payment the same way. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:48:02
Yes ! I am and the community is what makes it works. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:38:27
That is actually very interesting, I will definitely check it out for next travels.
