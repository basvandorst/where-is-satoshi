I mean sure, they might be able to sell a bitcoin here and there with LBC.

Its a bit complex, and i don't know exactly, but it would probably work something like this.
Run all chess game moves into a chess engine (stockfish or similar)
Do some basic probability calculations based on how frequently a user plays a move that is what stockfish considered the best move in that scenario.
If that user is way outside of 2 std deviations, or whatever (my stats knowledge sucks) then you know they are cheating.
The basic idea is that even the best players out there, like carlson, topolav, annand, etc. don't play perfect moves every time.
 stockfish has a linux version of its engine, likely you could send stuff to it via command line shell from whatever scripting language runs your site.
And to answer your second question, that is what we are talking about, cheating.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:24:47
I hate to jump on the hate parade but i just don't see this working.  Modern chess sites have very complex anti cheating algo's to prevent cheating with chess engines.  You would need to implement something like that.  But even then, people could just cheat once every couple moves or something, which would be next to impossible to detect.

Not sure who down voted you.  But it wasn't me.  Anyway, to answer your question: No i don't think corporations that make lots of international transactions can benefit from bitcoin at this time.  Maybe some day in the future, but the international remittance structure for bitcoin is still very much in its infancy.  For example i wanted to pay some indian employees recently with bitcoin, and it is simply not possible without them incurring massive fees, far greater than paypal/WU.  And this doesn't even include my costs of acquiring the bitcoin in the first place.  Or the risks involved due to volatility in the time between when i acquire it to the moment they cash it out.

Despite a great run in the Micromillions Main Event on PokerStars that saw him finish with a third-place result for $59,480.98, 29-year-old Italian player "RuiDeck" has not yet been able to cash his winnings yet because his bank simply won't let him.
"I had only $11 on my account at PokerStars," the player told Italy's ItaliaPokerClub, explaining that he eventually managed to win a ticket to the $22 buy-in Micromillions Main Event through a 10 FPP buy-in satellite.
Once in the Main Event, the player scored the best result in his poker career with a third-place finish worth almost $60,000 in a tournament that attracted 20,000 entries and crushed the guarantee.
"It has been an incredible joy," he said about his remarkable result, even if he then added that he also have some regrets for not bringing home the title.
"RuiDeck," who is based in Dresden, Germany, where he works as a waiter in a restaurant, also confessed that his dream victory pushed him to make some decisions that turned out to be much riskier than he had imagined.
"As soon as I won, I booked a flight to go home to Sicily to celebrate with my friends," he said. "Then, in the following days, I also resigned from my job to start a new adventure as a poker player."
Unfortunately for the player, however, cashing the sum he won in the Micromillions proved to be much more complicated than he had expected, as both the European norms against money laundering and the German legislation on gambling pushed his bank not to let him access the money.
"Initially, I have been told that my withdrawal would take approximately one week, as the policies against money laundering impose strict control on withdrawals of a sum bigger than €10,000," he explained to ItaliaPokerClub. "Then, my bank told me that my request could not be processed because poker is illegal in Saxony, the federal State where I reside."
Considerably worried about his situation, the player then contacted PokerStars. The poker room replied via email, stating that it could confirm "the full legitimacy of his winnings" and offered "RuiDeck" a letter of explanation for his bank that should solve all the concerns related to money-laundering issues.
"RuiDeck," who is now exploring the possibility of legal action, called the situation he found himself in "absurd."
"I have a regular account and, as a customer, I feel cheated," he said. "I don't understand if my bank, PokerStars, or Saxony's legislation are responsible for what has happened to me, but right know I can't cash the money I have regularly won and I don't even have a job anymore."

And it would take ages to get confirmed.  Perfect way to leave a sour taste in someones mouth.  If you're going to bother you might as well give him something reasonable like $5.  A 386 bit tip is a joke.  but maybe you're just trolling, and i got trolled.

I can charge credit cards without CVV or postal code through my payment processor. All i need is card number and expiry. It would actually be pretty trivial to charge this card. most expiry dates only go forward about 2 years, maybe three. so we're talking max 36 combination attempts to successfully charge this card.  You should cancel this card right away.  Unless this is a bank account number and not a credit card?
Edit: looks like its a visa. you should definitely cancel this card immediately.

Right, so right now, it still doesn't make any sense financially. You're just incurring unnecessary costs to be some sort of "trailblazer".  If you walked into a bank and they offered you two debit cards. one that would cost 3% on every transaction, and one with 0 fees.  which would you pick?  Why does this simple level of logic go out the window for bitcoiners?

Tell you what.  I've got $5 with your name on it. If you can tell me in a **few simple steps** how i can send it to you in the next hour (assuming i've never used bitcoin before).  And you have to actually receive it in the next hour.  Not 24 hours from now, etc.

@_date: 2015-03-22 06:30:29
I'm getting the feeling you didn't read my first comment because the only possible reply to this is repeating my first comment.  The $0.10 is trapped within change tip.  Once you actually manage to get it out to a bitcoin wallet it is useless because you cannot send it due to minimum transaction fees.  If you choose to waive the fee, you are stuck waiting for possibly 24-48 hours (possibly less, but i have had 0 fee transactions get stuck this long).  My original point was that this is a formula for creating a bad first impression of bitcoin to this first time user.  The $0.10 tip does not serve the purpose for context in which it was presented.

Its still actors, acting.  It will never be more real and authentic than home made porn, with real people, who actually are enjoying each other.  To each their own i guess.  But fake acting, and fake tits just don't do it for me.  The steak / burger analogy doesn't really fit.  You are implicitly assuming that that professionally produced porn is better than home made porn.  I guess if that is the industry you are in, that it is hard to see the truth here because you've got the blinders on.

You need to understand the difference between a market buy and a limit order to understand this.  Their buyback isn't a market buy, its a limit order, placed $5 below where they sold.  The big sell causes panic.  Other users start selling, the selling causes more selling, the market keeps selling, right into their lower limit order.  Their order eventually gets filled.  And they have made a profit, and have all their BTC back again.
edit:Lol what? why the downvotes? are you people seriously that confused about how a market works? at least tell me why you disagree.

Take a look at some of the others that have tried and failed and ask yourself, why did they fail? do i really want to put myself through this? is this really the most creative project i could be working on?  Will this ever be a positive return, or just a sinkhole?
For example, look at Vault of Satoshi.  Excellent exchange, loyal userbase, never got hacked, did everything right.  Still closed.
Its a tough market. you'll get attacked constantly, you'll need at least 3 people working full time on security.  You'll need a marketing team, tons of shills to pump your exchange.  You'll need startup capitol an bots to inject liquidity into your exchange.  The list goes on.  Get ready to drop about $250,000 that you'll never see again.
Best of luck!

Nah, most bitcoin exchanges have better security that the vast majority of the websites on the net.  The fact is, there is 0day vulnerabilities that come out all the time.  And if you are holding 2 million dollars that can be easily transferred away from you, you are a huge target, and a very large amount of people will constantly be trying new 0day vulns against you until one day, you get pwned.

So, let me get this straight.  You take a hit on your wages to convert them to bitcoin with bitwage.  Then you take another 0.45% hit from bitreserve to spend them.  Then you take another hit from the fees associated with the conversion from BTC-&gt;Fiat when purchasing something.
How is this better than just holding fiat and spending it when you need to with visa or debit, with zero fees.
