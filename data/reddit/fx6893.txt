Exactly. Schiff was making an argument against himself there.

You are using words like "willingness" and "intentionally" as if these were easy to prove in a court. The suspect in this case claims he doesn't remember the passwords. The judge doesn't believe him, and has put him in jail until he "produces the drives in an unencrypted state."
I personally own an encrypted hard drive with an old password that I don't remember. I can imagine if I was being investigated for some tax crime or whatever, and the government had a search warrant for my files, a judge might not believe me. Jail forever with no charges?
*"Forcing the custodian to testify orally as to the whereabouts of nonproduced records requires him to disclose the contents of his own mind. He might be compelled to convict himself out of his own mouth. That is contrary to the spirit and letter of the Fifth Amendment."* [Curcio v. United States, 1957](

Since it is such a small amount, here is what I would suggest:
First, find someone who a) you trust, b) uses both bitcoin and amazon, and c) is willing to help you out to get a new person started with cryptocurrency.
Then, ask him or her to trade. You'll just need a wallet to accept the bitcoins.

This makes the seed much less secure. First, because it is much easier to guess only 8 words rather than the full set of 24. (Like a billion times easier.) And second, because you now have three sets of mostly-solved seeds lying around, two off them out of your control.
I don't have a better solution, because this was my plan until when I realized recently that it was a bad idea.

And YOU forgot to mention that government immediately appealed that ruling, and last year [the 3rd Circuit ruled in the Mint's favor]( again affirming the forfeiture/seizure. Neither did you mention that this year the US Supreme Court declined to hear the Langford's case, [effectively ending the legal battle]( The government wins in the end, my friend.
