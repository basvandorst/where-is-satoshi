@_date: 2017-11-10 22:33:20
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:31:51
So monday the price wil drop even more cause of the bank wire transfers?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:11:48
Let's hope
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:58:00
Release your inhibitions
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:34:34
I am..
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:11:20
Thanks dude, if you're not being sarcastic like the most of em
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:18:28
What does FUDing mean?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:19:51
So you think it's a bad time to buy and it will drop way more?
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:38:35
Why do you think it will drop?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:55:10
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:48:50
I guess i learned my lesson..  
But i don't think it will be soon untill another drop, and buying now is a pretty dumb idea to buy at ATH
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:45:12
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:17:47
Waiting on next drop which might come when bitcoin silver comes out and will buy when low
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:33:53
So you think it will be around $5600 at the end of this year?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:07:38
5600-6400 In around a month or so?
Many believe it will be @ 10k in begin 2018
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:29:55
If you look at the other comment in this post from that solution will only make me not pay a fee of just 3 usd?
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:35:04
Yeah and i only have a passport and i need 2 types of vertification which i don't have, would you recommand for me to buy it on anycoin instead?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:50:57
I bought when they rised, then litterally seconds after i bought it they went down like $700
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:41:16
So buy now is better than monday, correct?
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:38:56
Cause i'm retarded
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:19:51
I hope not atm.  
Just bought BTC very fast to transfer it from bitfinex to coinbase. bought them at 6690 cus i had to act fast
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:14:14
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:56:05
I invested €3000 which is worth around €2200 atm
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:24:18
Does this mean another rise followed by a drop in price in BTC
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:49:14
Does the chirstmas season bring a pump?
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:27:06
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:21:36
Bought @ 7500
Sold @ 6700
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:06:55
Can you look into anycoin, if i buy it there and use my bitcoin address from blockchain i get a big fee
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:17:25
I don't wanna talk about it.. sold it all @ around €5400
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:09:26
Yeah wish i knew this before.. i fcked up
EDIT: always unlucky 
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:44:12
Could you maybe add the EUR option to your portfolio?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:10:23
I break even when it hits like $7700..
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:40:36
So it will rise again?
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:25:57
So if i buy €2000 from anycoin and send to to my blockchain i just pay 4 usd? i don't really think so tbh
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:39:39
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:06:48
Does this mean BTC will rise?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:41:28
So buy now is better than monday, correct?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:59:50
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:36:23
So, if i buy €2000,- worth it's still a $4 fee?
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:41:45
Do these site accept payments like PayPal or iDeal?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:23:19
tbh im panicing
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:43:44
I litterally bought @ 7600ish and sold @ 6700.  
I'm great at this
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:37:36
The fee of buying it on anycoin is not a problem.
The problem is transfering it to blockchain
