Seems like Bitcoin has reached a permanently high plateau.Thats what my shoe shine boy was saying anyway.

2018 year of truth.Always have some physical gold/silver in case of dire emergency.

Gold hasn't increased parabolic this year and thats an alternative to fiat?

Bitcoin Cash is the future.Accept it dinosaurs.

By the time lightning network is fully functional an altcoin will have surpassed bitcoin, most likely that will be bitcoin cash.The rot has set in.

How are your XBY holdings going?

True, the fees are too high.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:30:15
Bitcoin is killing itself with high fees and slow transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:47:59
Abandon ship!
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:39:09
Ethereum will overtake bitcoin in marketcap very soon.

Gold is up a few bucks.Real gold that is, not "digital gold".

Get the 6000 ones ready
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:51:26
Fuck off with your 28+ hour transaction times shill
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:00:38
I agree i was stupid.For not buying bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin core.
Lower transaction fees and faster transaction times with BCH.Way more viable as an actual currency to buy stuff....
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:27:37
I'll justbuy bitcoin cash next time.Core is not a viable currency at this time.
