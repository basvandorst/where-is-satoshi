I think the consensus is that all transactions that do not transfer value to BlockStream are spam.

As Bitcoin doesn't use a lot of bandwidth and isn't very time critical, it will probably be fine even without net neutrality. The biggest problem is that it might take longer to broadcast blocks, which could lead to increased mining centralization. But there are many applications other than Bitcoin that will suffer greatly without net neutrality.

Why do you even need trackers when you've got DHT?
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:41:09
Because of their domain i guess. Some people are probably tthinking it is the official blockchain page.
@_date: 2014-07-15 23:31:17
And make sure it's a BITcoin
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:56:37
I only think the ban is on converting ISK into other currencies (crypto or fiat). So it is probably legal to sell your AUR for BTC. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 03:14:32
No. If it was, an attacker could just find a compressed key instead of your uncompressed one, as it doesn't matter if they find your key or find another one that is also valid.

I just noticed Mastercoin also crashed around 30%. Is that somehow related?

The article claims that B⃦ (U+0042, U+020E6) is not recognized as a symbol. Some fonts may have problems displaying B⃦ correctly, but this has absolutely nothing to do with unicode. Both B⃦ and Ƀ are letters. Neither of them is a symbol according to unicode. It find it weird that the article does not discuss using ฿ or simply BTC as the currency symbol as these are probably the most widely used ones.

Nice! but it seems very similar to the Pirate Party. They should probably join forces. And who wouldn't vote for Kim DotCom.

Create an exchange that actually proves it is holding all user funds. Not like all the others where you can't really tell if they are insolvent.

Why not simply transfer bitcoins instead of using your own altcoin? You should be able to do exactly the same with bitcoins or have I missed something.
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:50:14
There should be an extension to the payment protocol that supports multiple payment addresses. That way you can avoid combining any of your outputs. The merchant will still be able to link the addresses, but at least it won't become public knowledge.

Don't worry! They can just sue coinbase for launching it first...
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:51:05
There is no official one. The blockchain itself is distributed over the bitcoin network and anybody can set up a web site to display it.

Incidentally the order was signed at Satoshi Nakamoto's birthday (April 5). Or maybe it's the other way around.

It is quite illogical, but this is how it is. If you don't trust me see the [Bitcoin wiki]( which clearly states that millibitcoin is the same as millibit.
@_date: 2016-06-25 14:29:32


No. 1 bit is 0.000001 bitcoin which is 100 satoshi.


1 millibit (aka millibitcoin) is 0.001 bitcoin which is 100,000 satoshi

Taking the arithmetic or geometric mean wouldn't be good either, as someone could just vote for a very high/low value forcing the value up/down. I think the best solution would be to take the median.

While it is not terribly complicated it is still simpler just to use bitcoin.

If they create a new currency it will only complicate things, as  people need to convert their bitcoins into this currency.
@_date: 2015-04-24 20:49:41
Which one?

Adding a new signature algorithm has nothing to do with SegWit. It can easily be done as a softfork, with or without SegWit.
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:33:53
116 characters long. Starts with "PM".
Something like this: PM92LjNLynHEswFYfhMXSGisPY9PudKs8mfhp7taHcRhWHo52ZMGAbdZ7dPd9eEjaf1r6bv2znV9B1ynQt9jFExqAin7n8wS7VqBTH3rzM44o8aUzTpa

BIP 101 is a proposal to raise the maximum blocksize from 1MB to 8MB (and later more). It will only activate if a majority of miners support it (750 out of last 1000 blocks), and under no circumstances before Jan 11, 2016.
@_date: 2015-11-15 16:15:44
This is old news. According to [Google Trends]( (same link at bottom of article) bitcoin has been googled more than yuan since March 2013.
@_date: 2016-10-19 00:19:13
No, it can just be a new address format (similar to P2SH). And you could require both an ECDSA signature and a quantum resistant one, so even if the new algorithm was totally broken the funds will still be secure against normal computers.
I have no idea how Core will spin it, but in my opinion it is a lot safer than some of the things currently being supported by Core (like SegWit and lightning network).
@_date: 2015-11-30 13:17:11
Yes, but please note that Bitstamp (and others) will only switch when a clear majority of the miners support BIP 101, meaning that this will probably be the mainstream fork. But if you're using an exchange that doesn't support BIP 101 your could very well end up on the non-mainstream fork (unless they choose to switch).

@_date: 2015-11-27 20:24:48
Thank you Peter! My first tip :D
@_date: 2015-11-19 03:11:18
It needs to encode both a public key (33 bytes) and a chain code (32 bytes). However it also includes some unnecessary data that could be removed, yielding a total length of 96 characters. I don't know why they haven't done that though.
@_date: 2015-11-30 16:15:10
BIP 100 hasn't been implemented yet. If it is implemented however, Bitstamp could support BIP 100 and BIP 101 simultaneously, and then follow whichever activates first. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 14:05:07
No, not currently. But BIP 101 will not activate unless a majority of the miners support it. So until a majority of miners support it, everyone stays on the same fork, whether or not they support BIP 101.
@_date: 2016-05-12 23:38:55
Classic is not perfect, but at least it supports BIP 109, which Core still doesn't support. So Classic is still the better choice.
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:24:05
Then you will be able to spend your coins on both forks.

Why wouldn't he run classic? Classic ensures that you're always on the longest chain, so there is absolutely no reason not to.
