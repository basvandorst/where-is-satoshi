Nope. But at least the iOS-Version is really great. 
I really do like the concepts and the guys behind Threema are nice and willing to answer your questions / concerns via email.
What would you like to check in the trial? It's basicly a messenger with text, short video and imagesupport. The performance is great, the UI really sleek and easy to handle.
The only thing that may be annoying is that push-notifications don't contain the messages text. That is because only you can decrypt the message and the push comes directly from a server

I don't get your logic because 1. every cent provision does help those guys who played tricks on you and 2. trading with money means that you did not even request a payout yet

Exporting DB-Records to CSV is quite common. Does not mean at all that Mark did it or that this is the way he stored the data. It's just a dump
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:16:38
It's elegant AND includes the mesh-idea. Great work!
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:08:23
That is no reason to actively continue to use it there.. Do you want them to get your provision just for keeping you in jail?
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:28:17
Thats true but some libs make it harder to fail then others.  offers only a very few methods which is a good thing.. Keeps the complex parts inside the lib

And before of that he regulary pointed out what a great job they are doing. They were fishy right from the beginning.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:39:03
They know best that you should not trust anybody out there..

And all the people are still / again using MtGox? What the fuck is wrong with you? Just switch to bitstamp or bitcoin.de or any other merchant.. I really don't get it. That was not the first thing Gox did wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:01:31
Yes I bet they must have some form of correlation-feature.
If not you are maybe able to share the data? You did a great thing, but I think there is more to gain then those bar-charts
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:01:51
that's fine as long as there is a significant 700-wall and a big gap before it
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:33:50
Yeah, without chatpartners a messenger is quite pointless.
To the price-thingy: The more money they earn from the app themself, the lower the risk of them feeling in need to earn money from ther users data or via adds. Servers and development can be really expensive. Considering you need to temporally store all the texts, videos and pics thats quite some data you need to process. Offering a free first year which would mean that they had to pay everything on their own currently, sound quite tough and bad.

I smell BS... PHP has nothing to do with HTML. If you want to change the layout / look and feel of your website, PHP gives you nothing (unless you are using a template-engine which still requires you to understand HTML). And PHP itself does not define the sec-level of a website.

I think he is a really clever guy but from what I 'learned' of him from his talks/interviews/keynotes he sometimes seems to have quite preconceived/strict opinions.. I remember him ranting about the terminology "wallet" and how unbelievable stupid its name is, since it is only a keychain (yeah he is right.. But would any random dude understand this?). Maybe there were just a few people with the 'wrong' opninions
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:03:44
By the way, for bitcoin.de-discussions head to: 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:03:43
Even then it is BS. Although I would never tend to use a CMS for that use-case, it is still legit for many others. And by all the shit Gox did in the past (and I fully agree on the fact that Mark often showed proved himself of having no clue at all about what he is doing) you still have to consider that it grew quite fast. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:53:56
It turns around and..... ruuuuuuuns!
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:05:32
By the way.. If you want to switch to/inform yourself about bitcoin.de, sea this reddit 
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:07:09
TBH I don't like the idea of trading for profit at all and think traditional stock-exchanges are nothing but a pita.
Bitcoin-Exchanges are needed to get the stone rolling, I get that, but things like gox harm the exchangerate artificially too. I picked 700 as that seemed like a quite stable thing before the recent issues.. currently there are some big players dropping the prices with aimed walls. That is also quite fucked up. But agreeing in public is the more fair alternative in my opinion

To track funds you don't need the private key.. Does blockchain have every users private key?

Just posted it ;) Using Burnbit first was good to prove the torrents source is the same as the blog
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:08:01
Then what is the new bottleneck? Indexing? You could provide an indexed version as DL right?
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:01:16
But if 51% of the people making transactions decide they don't want to pay TX-fees, the miners have to react some way. Doesn't matter how much hashing power they have.
And if 1000 miners which have only 1% hashing-power are pissed about the one with 99%, they could decide to use clients which ignore blocks from the one mighty miner ;)

Do you need to encourage yourself?
To bubble, or not to bubble.. Time will tell. If you can't stand the risk, don't take it. If you can.. just watch :P

How valuable is a glass of water to you? And how valuable do you think it is for somebody who walked in the desert, with the sun burning on his neck?
How much is the production-cost of an iPhone5 / Samsung Galaxy S3?
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:54:01
Cool! Didn't know that. Is it updated regulary?

Many here argue that fees are needed ant that Bitcoin, by design, is not meant to be a system for micropayments. In the end I don't believe this statement is true considering that you can send amounts like 1 Satoshi.
Also: If the forced fee was 0.0005 when the BTC was ~ 3$ and still is now, there has to be a problem.
I think that faucets and other services are a great thing to get newbies started with bitcoins. But if you I imagine that a user collected many many bitcoins with transactions &lt; 0.00008 then he will be really pissed to see how much he has to pay if he wants to send some of those hard earned coins.

if it is just verifying, you can skip that if it comes from a trusted source; If it is the indexing that takes so long, you can also skip that by downloading a indexed version
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:53:14
Downloading the blockchain as whole p2p is not the same as downloading one block after another (from an untrusted p2p-source), validating and indexing it

Actually I voted the video up because I found it very informative and well-explained.
I just wanted to make clear that psonik made a valid point

Ha! Nice april fool!

If there would be any way around this, I would not trust Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:56:36
They say that because if you have the main hashing power on the net, others have less time to catch up before you create blocks all over and over again.
On blockchain you can search for detected double spends.. Does not seem that this happened so often with bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:46:12
I'm quite sure I am not the first one to do something like that and there might be much better implementations then that out there, but I still wanted to give it a try ;)
Any feedback is very welcome.
I also think that this reddit might be a good place to see which other exchanges you want to see in that widget.
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:48:18
Works for me. Does it not accept your OTPs?
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:47:34
How do you mean that? They only Trade Bitcoin. You can deposit as many btc as you want, generate deposit-addresses as you wish and withdraw at any time. Some people use bitcoin.de as an online-wallet but I wouldn't recommend it, although it is possible.

For me Multi-Wallets is a nice feature. Many others like the one-time-paper-backups.
Regarding your other question: If you would just use another hard drive and plug it to a computer with internet-connection, that wouldn't be cold storage. Cold means that the client is running / the wallet is stored on a computer without any internet-connection:  
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:02:22
You buy the bitcoins from other users.. You pay them the money, they confirm they got the money, you get the BTC to your bitcoin.de-account and are able to withdraw
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:25:26
Do you use bitcoin-qt and downloaded a precompiled version / did not have a look at the source-code? Then you already do trust them much more
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:20:09
If you are using the current client you download the single block from any random person. It needs just that single person to manipulate it, thats why validating the received block is a must.
In the scenario I described you exactly know that the blocks are coming from the same people as the client you are using. Thats why you don't need to validate it (or maybe validate the whole download once with the provided MD5), as long as you trust bitcoin.org

Thanks (: I understand the controversy around Java and why many people decide to not install any JRE at all, although all of the recent security-gaps only mattered if you used Java-Applets or Webstart-Applications in your browser. Still, thank you for your feedback!
