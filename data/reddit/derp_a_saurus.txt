Good luck, all! Thanks, OP!

Or in the words of some other guy, "like qwop doing a tax return"
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:28:34
Kinda irritated. I'm already a member with my .edu, which happened to be part of that leak a few weeks back. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:02:04
You're a funny one.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:25:23
It's unfortunate, but I've found it to be reliable. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:42:17
Not sure if that last part is reccomendable--Distortion of the key and the like. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:44:33
That's how pools work, yes. However, your hashrate will be pitiful compared to the big guns. You'll make pennies, if that.

Between this sub i'm sure there's more than enough funding to do it. I'd be willing to provide production services to make the video happen, then we'd just need to pay to air. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:11:19
Good on you for  helping, but please please post these things in @_date: 2013-11-19 06:04:27
The shit's been growing exponentially on a logarithmic scale, predictably. Will it happen? Maybe. Is it definitely a reasonable possibility at this point? I'd say so.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:02:50
Welcome to the future!
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:51:47
Banking regulations! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:25:21
You're going to lose money. The electricity you use is more expensive than the return. The other big problem is the ASIC miners(the only ones that make any sense to use at this point) don't ship for months after you order them, and they're far obsolete when you do get them. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:53:27
The problem is sometimes there's a delay in withdrawing coins or cash out of certain exchanges--Mtgox most famously. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:49:36
This is unfortunate. Get this to the top. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:35:08
Bitcoins are divided into 100 million units--Satoshis. It may divide further in the future. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:09:23
You really do make a good point. It's the type of thing where you need a good amount of effort and research to get it. Ultimately though, it's if you think it's worth the effort for the long term investment. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:24:50
No evidence on this side but gox and btctalk seem to be under attack. Might just be really high volume with the corrections. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:48:17
Just me, or does this look heavily shopped?
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:25:00
Yep.  lists off some. It's a every half hour fountain. Slow but reliable. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:42:44
How about just giving it to @_date: 2013-12-01 21:08:52
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:56:44
You'd make a few pennies a day, max. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:16:47
To the best of my knowledge, yes. You're using an unregulated decentralized currency to gamble. Then you're going to an exchange that so far has not been regulated to sell your coins for fiat. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:22:12
Most stress inducing gif ever? I think so. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:17:44
Due to banking regulations,  is the closest I can think of. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:37:15
Since there's no direct integration now, that's your option. Giving a specific wallet adress allows for tracking of payments and the like. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:20:14
Post this in this is not the place. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:23:56
I try my best to do it already. I like the idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:45:04
I know the feeling well, man. More for us is the way I see it. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:14:33
I'd give, but unfortunately i'm a starving college student with 0 in my wallet. Best of luck reaching that 10 and beyond, i'm proud of being at least here to see all this great stuff happening with BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:00:41
Man, I'm a starving college student. Any help is appreciated. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:43:43
Eh, about 10 gills. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:36:17
This whole thread makes me proud of being a coiner.

Tag your shop items with 'bitcoin' so they appear in the search results: 
How to Accept Bitcoins on Etsy:
-Edit your Shop Announcement page so that it says 'Bitcoin Accepted.'
-Go to Your Shop &gt; Shipping &amp; Payment &gt; Payment Methods. Select "Other" as a method.
-After the buyer has purchased an item using "Other," you can contact them with instructions so they can send payment to your bitcoin address.
Here is a 'Bitcoin Accepted Here' img to put on your website if you have one: 
I recommend coinbase.com for an online bitcoin wallet to get started with.
Let me know if you have any questions.
