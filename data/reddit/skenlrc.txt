is going to be the HF core is forced to do after they lose all the hash power. And i can bet right now, that you and all the no2xer goons will accept it without saying anything

you are everything that is wrong with the crypto space

1) already out there, prove to be insufficient
2) Unlike ECSDA, There is no standard for this, and theres the "cancelation problem" that hasnt been resolved yet
3, 4) Is not in beta stage yet, who knows how much time it will take for release, and adoption

it at least makes it harder for fakers to fake. the number of nodes is irrelevant after certain number, and that number is pretty low. what matters is who is controlling the most active nodes. in short, having your full node and not doing anything except forwading and validating data is useless.

dude, i think you are a bit confused about networks, consensus, and the value of bitcoin. not going to bother with you since clearly you are pretty ignorant on the subject, and are talking without knowing.

yeah because you want to be happy in your little safe space LOL

reddit is trash, i have opened like 20 accounts.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:19:27
how exactly does it "represent" x amount of coin? by the amount it broadcasts? i'm pretty sure nodes that broadcasts 100k in BTC TXs/day are not going to use Raspberry PIs. They are going to use 3.5 BTC nodes lol. the whole Raspberry PI thing is nonsense

if been in reddit for longer makes me as stupid as you. then boy im quitting!
metcalf law refers to users, ppl putting good money, you know like miners, investors or companies, not idiots in raspberry pi's. you go and believe whatever fantastical nonsense you choose to believe and pay the consequences for it.

why you dont understand, what matters is the quality of the node, not how many are there. not all nodes are created equal. nodes are just gateways to the network. if they are just there not broadcasting new transactions like exchanges or online wallets, or not broadcasting appended blocks like miners do, they ARE IRRELEVANT. get that through your head dummy.
yeah miners are your "bitches" they just invested BILLIONS of dollars, unlike devs, they actually get paid on BTC, they have everything on the line, they secure the network. What does it take to spin a node? nothing, then it means nothing
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:18:01
"easy to spot" so we are going to trust exactly who to determine that, you? what you and lopp are saying that a node in bitfinex has the same weight as a raspberry PI node on my basement. Which is ridiculous

enjoy your sybil attacks LOL. anyone with a couple of hundred bucks can spin full nodes in AWS
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:03:08
nodes are pretty much worthless
