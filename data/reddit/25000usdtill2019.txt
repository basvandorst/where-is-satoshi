I was stressing out a few days ago (Dec 19) because I missed the low prices of the coins I like. My eyes were glued to the screen, hoping the price drops again. I chose cnd and xlm as my first two coins! (I cursed myself for not choosing xvg and xrp! because I liked them as well) Binance also took about 6 hours to process my second deposit (I cursed them, as well) Lol I didn't use that for a day as prices were soaring. Then come yesterday I woke up with btc at 15.2k! I bought immediately (from a local app) And it just kept on plunging from there. I tried buying other coins when all the prices were dropping. But the fuck, they just kept on on falling...(fck,fck) I bought in increments to see how far they can go down but it just won't stop, fuck! Everytime I buy a coin at its steady lowest price (it is steady because I watched its movement lol) its price just fell big time. I was thinking wow my judgment is cursed, I triggered all of it and I was sure that binance was on me. 
I am so freaking tired and stressed out. Lol, I actually don't care if I lose my money all together anymore. Bye, bye lofty dreams, I have accepted my fate to be an ass-kisser to bunch of ass-kissers to raise money. 
Thing is, I think I've learned a huge thing or two from less than a week of trading on exchanges. I actually don't learn from merely reading and taking advices, I have to live it for me to learn. Lol What a warm welcome, cryptoworld!

Yes! What else do you do if you bought at 15k. Damn! Lots of lessons learned though. Don't get carried away by FOMO. Know what real dip is. Real dip doesn't last for a couple minutes. Okay?
