Bitcoin has failed to deliver on its promise of fast and cheap transactions. Unless it gets fixed, and soon, I hope it fails too.

Do the research. It will not make any alt obsolete.

Imagine it kind of like a stock. An ICO is basically a Kickstarter for a project. Hopefully the project addresses an issue currently faced in some way, whether it be distribution, sending money,  publishing/licensing digital content, etc. 
People invest in the idea of a new tech by purchasing the coin associated with it. 
Most of these are new networks that utilize the coins as a method of payment for using the network. Everything right now is very speculative, which explains why it can be considered "gambling". No one knows which projects will last, but if you do some research you will quickly find out there are at least 5 that are absolutely here to stay. The rest?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Ahem, BCH
Been there. Done that. Works great.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:25:34
No it will not.

Oh I agree. Like I said, I'm excited about the concept of decentralized currency. May the best win. Or maybe there are multiple winners!
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:20:50
My point still stands. We're on our way to becoming a global society. How neat would it be if Bitcoin or monero or a coin/chain that hasn't even been made yet takes over as a world currency? 
Either way. I'm just way excited about crypto possibilities in general. I just started understanding the more intricate details about ethereum and sia. The dapp concept and decentralization in general gets me giddy. What a time to be alive. Crypto and the technology behind it are very much needed lights in a dark world of financial inequality, and what has seemed to me at least, a stagnation in the progress of socially integrated technology since the advent of the internet.

But.... What if it does???
This is revolutionary tech... It's fun to think about.

Tickle on the ear?
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:34:08
You're okay.... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:03:27
Yes. That's what has caused this huge increase. There is a finite supply of bitcoin too. 
And yes. You can buy as little or as much as you want 24 hours a day, all over the world.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:39:42
You all blow my mind.

Depending on what your cost would be, I would pay upwards of 40 bucks. 
I'll not familiar with the cost of everything needed though, li ke the 3d printer material and the mechanisms for the incline and such.
I say do it! This is a really fun/great idea!
You could even rig up a little speaker to play a "Woooo!" noise or something when it goes up every x amount of dollars or so. And a scream for when it goes down. 
Maybe that's overkill.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:52:20
Yup. We'll be ok. What's a bummer is that this dip allows for some dipshits (i.e. billionaires and banks) to buy up a lot.
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:42:57
Fucking genius. I would buy multiple. Naturally with bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:02:09
The big part is that it's trust-less. You don't have to put your faith into a third party.
Inefficient? Hardly. Outside of BTC, there are transactions that complete within seconds. The only cost being electricity, which is drastically cheaper than the average hourly wage of someone handling the regulation/oversight of transactions and asset movement.
This really is revolutionary tech that will change how the entire world operates economically and socially.

According to [this]( Bitcoin eats up $2 billion a year in energy cost.
A quick Google search for bankers salary gives me an average of 38k/yr. 
Google again said there are 6800 bank branches in the US.
38k x 2 (2 bankers per branch) x 6800 = $516,800,000
Half a billion dollars and that's not counting any investment/private bankers, brokers, traders etc. ONLY in branch bankers from places like Wells Fargo.
With digital assets like mortgages and such you could include the salaries for anyone working in those industries who are responsible for executing or overseeing the transactions.
But all of that doesn't matter because of your point on global adoption... 
You're right. There is no sustainability if widespread adoption happens. PoW can only work if huge breakthroughs in solar power efficiency/storage happen, to help support the power consumption. But even then there are better alternatives already available. I'm a fan of proof of stake personally.

I remember the last post with this idea! So excited to see it!

STOP! *My penis can only get so erect*
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:22:10
Yup. I'm digging right now to see what's up
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:35:57
I feel ya. I'm in the exact same boat, but I'm playing the long game so I don't feel too concerned.
