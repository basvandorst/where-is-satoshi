Many coins are centralised. The current success or xrp is beyond me.

I have never had any problem with them aswell and tranfered over 600 usd in canadian dollars (arround 780). Good luck to you hopefully this will be settled very soon. Cheers

Idk about you but my energy is 100% hydro electricity. Y'all need to stop voting for dumb fucks that think coal is clean and we won't have a problem.

As i said, I was hanging at arround 17 18 degrees. Its most likely not as efficient
However, considering i reduced the ambient temp AND i mined, it was cheaper.

Hell yeah. I live in quebec canada in an small appartment block and i did not heat the whole winter. Granted i can live very well at 17-18 degree celcius. Saved up to 30 bucks a month on electricity lmao

I saved money by not turning on my buildings 30 years old heating system, wich is electric. The heat from my rigs was sufficient enough to my liking. I checked both my bills from this year and the last and i spent arround 30$ less per month in 2018, and the average temp was also colder. So indeed i saved on heat using my rigs, and on top of that i profitted with the coins. ( like 300-400$ worth at the time? )

Funny he doesnt seems to know what consensus is. Also back at the drug dealer and terrorism bullahit argument. Nothing new to see here, boys.
