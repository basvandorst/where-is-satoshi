This better be cheap, China should be able to mass produce these for pennies on the dollar.

If I recall a 7950 gets ~550 MHash/s. At current difficulty using this calculator:
That's ~4.38 BTC a month ($737 at current market price). Paying the hardware off in like a little under 2 months? 
This is all just going by this calculator and the current Newegg price of 7950, in my opinion mining is going to be getting a lot more difficult soon with so much new attention towards bitcoin. Your call.

Inadequate servers made a currency drop 40% in a day, impressive. Hopefully after the upgrade Bitcoin's largest exchange won't be running off a toaster.
EDIT: Mt. Gox you really screwed the pooch on this one. One could easily say it was your greed that kept the trading platform online, you very well knew that your servers couldn't handle the stress. By turning off the trading platform until that issue was resolved you could very well have avoided this "speculated pop" and let the other exchanges split the load for a while. I know hindsight is 20/20, but as a big influence in bitcoins growth, you should know better.

It's only $3.99, I gave it because I thought the whole ordeal was hilarious. :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:13:41
Still much higher than it was last week, as a quote to a post I saw earlier.
"Two steps forward and one step back is still a step in the right direction"
Something like that. We'll recover, as long as the people that (sadly) have this much influence in Bitcoin make better decisions from here on in.

He was an early adopter and of course everyone wants to catch his attention, for a lot of us every single one of those tips could be life changing. I know it would be for me. Five whole bitcoins? Shit man I have 0.59 and that's all I could afford, but at least I got in at like $140/BTC. So it has increased.

Admittedly though, I'll buy at single digit no problem.

Not everyone who goes on Mt. Gox will check their Facebook page. However everyone who goes to Mt. Gox... goes to Mt. Gox. So it's only logical to make it very clear on their site about this maintenance. Bitcoin is sensitive today, had a wild ride.

I can see how you could get cheated outta money by sending BTC and never getting paid, but the other way around sounds like you can do something about it. What did you use to pay?
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:21:20
I understand that ideas like this to meet peoples' needs for simplicity is very tempting to create into a paid service. But you've gotta look at it this way, if you build a service that people love, you'll be very properly rewarded for doing so. The bitcoin community is very generous and if you're up to the challenge of creating the next best thing in keeping track of our beloved currency then go right ahead.
My suggestion, make it happen, make it freely accessible to anyone, watch you receive good fortune for doing so. Many services live and even thrive off of the donations of good people who like what you've provided.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:48:21
Need to get this more attention so Mt. Gox sees it and doesn't cause more unnecessary panic. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:04:48
It gives me faith in the Bitcoin as a whole, with people like this who are big players in Bitcoin, we're heading in the right direction! Now cmon bitcoin be worth $1000 so my measly 0.59 can be worth something good! &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:44:39
Used PayPal for 3 years for internet marketing -- just recently I did very well in a month, so well that they decided that my account was too risky and they would apply a 20% rolling reserve for 180 days. Meaning for 6 months they would hold 20% of everything I earn to cover their ass.
PayPal is bullshit, they only finally released my funds when I complained with the DFI.

See now this here is an idea, I personally was playing around with the market of LTC on BTC-E today. It was very fun and I made a pretty penny. A lot more forgiving to play around with a currency that fluctuates between $2.50 ~ $5
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:39:10
Since you can predict the future, what will BTC prices be a week from now? I'd like to take advantage of your skills.
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:42:21
300 SLL is about $1.15, not too much you can do with it considering fee's for transferring typically exceed that.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:49:15
Single digit and I'll score a couple coin for funsies.

It was a good try buddy.

That's perfectly fine to get the news out about other communities related to Bitcoin. But asking for tips would be a no-no. Takes away the point of a tip right?
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:16:54
Therein lies your call. Play it safe and invest into something a little less intense or risk it to get the biscuit.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:57:00
Oh cool my first bitcointip! Thanks :)

What a shame it bases off of Gox.

Seems really unnecessary that there's a different website and layout for each category. Not to mention they honestly don't look that great -- i'd have a lot of trouble trusting a website that looks like this. Just my 2 bitcents.

The new Redbull flavors are pretty tasty, picked up a few to stick it out and see this unfold.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:21:29
Who knows. A Dozen? Maybe more maybe less, maybe Satoshi and his pals were the only ones mining for a while before anyone even knew about it. Nobody knows how active it was at the start, but clearly there weren't many.
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:56:26

Have you ever begged someone for $156 because you "just wanted to own $156". Because that's exactly what you're doing right now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:15:20
It was new, there wasn't many people around not to mention people dedicating hardware to push out enough power to increase the difficulty. It was virtually unknown besides the small circle it existed in. I mean think about the guy who bought the pizzas for 10,000 BTC. The stuff was easy back then like with anything new. Not surprised.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:11:56
Yeah I'm not sure exactly how much more power you get from tri or quad, all I did was calculate it as if there were 4 7950's with that right there so I did 2,200 MHash/s. That's stock, so whatever more you can squeeze outta them of course is better, just not sure what the power cost will be and if you'll see enough ROI to even bother. Tough call really.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:52:37
I'm not a pro in any way so don't quote me on this, but GPU mining as far as I'm aware is already becoming obsolete. People aren't sure how far off the ASIC miners really are. There's a ton of speculation around them right now, people think they aren't even going to get shipped and the whole thing is a scam.
My two bitcents, unless you can get some serious power to mine, it isn't worth it, the difficulty is just so high now, hard to have much of an influence.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:06:58
The sentiment I'm sure is appreciated but I'd advise against it. There will be 1000's of people who will try to exploit this tragedy to profit from it. There will be many people who will set-up fake charities/places to raise money for the Boston people and make out like bandits.
I don't know you or your intentions but I advise ANYONE against donating to any charity that isn't extremely trusted(including this one) and instead donate to either redcross or other "official" charities.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:07:21
I believe the consensus is you'll just about always break even or  end up in the hole.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:32:53
Someone needs to edit this picture to be dropping bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:30:04
Good intentions aside, BTC can be converted to cash. If someone wants to donate that badly they can convert their BTC to cash and donate to the proper charities that are set-up by the state or redcross.
Nobody is stopping you from starting yours, I'm just here to advise people against donating to unofficial charities. Good sentiment though, it's well appreciated.

~$2,500,000,000 market value at the time and $13,000 crashed it. Yeah the fuck right.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:09:49
Oh yeah definitely, no one entity should have that significant of an impact on Bitcoin as a whole. That's the reason for that one post on Reddit recently about switching from BTCGuild for mining to another pool so that BTCGuild didn't have such a vast control over the network.
Likewise with Mt. Gox. Sure their service is easy and accessible, I just hope after this whole ordeal other exchanges gain some popularity and the load is divided. Last thing Bitcoin needs is someone in charge.
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:14:54
Really?! Hey guys did you hear the Winklevii have money in bitcoins. I bet nobody here saw the other 5,396 posts about it.

Upgraded from a toaster to a microwave.
