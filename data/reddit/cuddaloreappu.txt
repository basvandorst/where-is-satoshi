what is wrong if one comes with a nice innovative feature in an altcoin which will revolutionize the way we deal with cryptos.
u will say that is possible in bitcoin too, but is it really? the process right now is so tedious going through all the bitcoin core developers getting consensus..
thus altcoin are real test beds for innovations

i read that satoshi himself said some 20 super nodes is enough and others can be a light clients...
so why can't we all quit complaining and let Google Facebook amazon PayPal build server farms and become supernodes to handle those 1gb or 1tb block size and let bitcoin handle transactions like 30000tps and become currency of the world and go to moon

Litecoin  was nothing but a fork of bitcoin with some rules changed. but ethereum is a whole new game , a turing complete stuff from which smart contracts can be done. comparing litecoin with bitcoin is like comparing apples and oranges..
Moreover after the flippening, bitcoin may take a second place and there are chances that it could correct upto 95%  since it will occupy the position that litecoin has occupied so far.
