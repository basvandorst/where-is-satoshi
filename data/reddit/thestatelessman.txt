It depends how you look at it. As noted, half of those transactions came in 2015 alone — and I don't see any other alternative currency competing with it.

My understanding is that regulation of currencies is already within the bank's legislated power, but let me confirm.

Thanks for sharing, mate. Will have a listen right now.

Understood, and I appreciate your respectful engagement — at least towards me. :)

Evil is another matter. He knows the status quo and has the arrogance to want to just outright ban anything that interrupts it.

Perhaps in some areas of study, but not when it comes to bitcoin.

You might want to read the article, since his assertion is that it need not be either or.

Point to the section please.
I saw that article too, and the guy is incorrect.
If you read the article from the attorney, she states that the law gives a monopoly to the release of digital currency, in the hands of the state. That is a ban on bitcoin, because all other digital currencies are illegal.

Have you read the law? Point to the section that you refer to.
The author of the original article, [here]( is an Ecuadorian attorney who did read the law.

Did I say anything about a network? Did she? No. You are playing word games for no good reason.
Bitcoin is not illegal in the United States, and there has been no law declaring a state monopoly on digital currency.
Evidently you are just recalling a rough memory from years ago of what may or may not have been a correct translation. Best of luck to you.

False equivalence. The Ecuadorian law specifically stated a monopoly on the release/provision of digital money.
There was no digital currency in 1913. Further, thus far courts have held that bitcoin in the United States is property and taxable on all gains/transactions. That means that bitcoin users are, de facto, in violation of tax laws for not declaring and paying for gains realized on holding the cryptocurrency.

This is the state broadcaster, TVNZ, and people should know that it remains the dominant channel and source of news in New Zealand. The thinking they offer is so common down under, it brings back many memories.

TVNZ is the state broadcaster and most dominant media outlet in the country. The lady leading that show has been prominent in New Zealand media for decades, and this kind of panel is the status quo.
When I was a child in the 1980s, New Zealand only had two channels, and TVNZ's Channel One was the main one. Only in 1990 did Channel 3 arrive, and it only in the mid-1990s did any competitive channels really gain a foothold. TVNZ still dominates though.
