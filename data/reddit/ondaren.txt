It won't be long before all these "good" democratic governments crack down on Bitcoin if it actually manages to start accomplishing what it's supposed to accomplish. You'll be in for a rude awakening.

Sometimes the requirements can be a pain but it's well worth the switch if you can achieve it.

How am I generalizing? There have been numerous cries for campaign finance reform ever since citizens united. I still haven't heard why I should get behind the idea of telling people what they can or cannot do with their own money. I don't see how limiting people's ability to spend money is somehow equated to a more equal and free democratic society.
It's the same thing as saying "sure, you can practice your religion but you can't spend any money on it!", it's nonsensical.
This situation of rent-seeking is a byproduct of a government that has too much say and too much power. Not to say there isn't "dark money" in politics but do you honestly believe that campaign finance reform will ever be able to stop that?
Honestly, I'm not even sure what you could do as an alternative to fix this besides limiting the government but your sentence here:


Isn't quite as clear and dry as you make it sound.

What if campaign finance reform simply leads to more corrupt incumbents staying in power. Since they are the ones who, just like before, write all the laws. People need to stop looking at the government to fix the problems in government for everything.
