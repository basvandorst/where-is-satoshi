There's no changes that would impact the behaviour like this. If it worked before, it wasn't running the code in this repo at all.

19Be6qFfQnM4e4azZXZ8vsA5eABN7J3YHM is the destination of a shared coin transaction, find the origin.

"Open source" is fairly pointless too. Not one piece of the code in their repo can be run by somebody external. Shared Coin is meant to be I suspect, but given it's full of binary blobs and hardcoded variables so I would bet against it happening. Their blog says that there's open source projects to contribute to, but I'm not seeing them.

Not at all. 
Shared Coin doesn't use or force like size inputs, it makes a list of random sized outputs and makes transactions on your behalf from blockchain.info's own wallet. 
What you end up with in the end is a chain of transactions in which every input is unspent except for the one owned by the initiator of the coinjoin, which is spent all the way until the last transaction. The size of the input is identical to the size of the output, and none of the other sizes will match from start to finish. It's completely, painfully obvious what is going on. 
You can expose these transactions by eye. Every single prior mix with this service has been exposed.

Sadly it does not. There's no deniability at all, the path through the fake coinjoin is very clear for anybody to see. Anybody can search through all past Shared Coin transaction and find the real origin and destination with nothing more than their eyes.

**Yes, you found my original addresses through the Shared Coin spend**. 
It really is that easy!
Great job.

It'll still affect confirmation times. Your transactions can likely skip a block ghash makes because it is too full.

No, you'll end up at an address with a normal spend as it's only other transaction. You're on the right track, look a little further back in time.

The orphans page is also broken, the block by day pages are broken, as are all the graphs. Who knows what they do all day.

Another user in the thread did.

The number of mixes doesn't matter at all, the result is still the same. It's a massive waste of money to do that. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 22:36:28
That downplays it as being just a toy and can only be broken by professionals. We all know it was promoted as the super secure mixer from the stars and not as a toy. It can be broken manually.

Well no. The same number of blocks are going to be mined one way or the other. If half of them are artificially 1/3 the size then the ultimate rate of transactions is going to be limited. Most blocks are above 300KB on average so they are  affecting the confirmation time to a noticeable degree by doing so.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:47:36
That's bollocks. 


You can do it by eye.
