Yes, will try, thank you. Sure the buy button finger will itch. Hard. But fingers crossed.

What gravity? We've all been waiting for gravity. Just bailed on us the whole year.

Y’all didn’t sell yet? ��

No, I bought this year. Yet, reading about all this TA (which I don’t truly believe in but causes herd effects) saying 4.2k was either the final OR just a temporary resistance line on the way to 1.5k, I figured why watch my coins loose so much if I can just sell them and rebuy double the amount back in a few days or weeks. Was painful but so far it seems to have worked. (Will never try to time the market again tho)

That's actually REALLY funny.

Yes, exactly my POV as well. Something is not fitting with this story. I do have trouble trusting Binance fully myself, but I have even more trouble believing you would just let  $5Mio Dollar sit with Binance, writing Reddit-Posts instead of sending them your whole gang of lawyers over. 
This guy must either be:
a) not sh\*t-rich and the luckiest and smartest trader of all time (having managed to hold on to his BTC through like 4 Bull runs some way -&gt; hence cheap buy in price years ago) and by that not able to afford good lawyers or
b) a scam trying to shy away from direct confrontation w/ Binance for good reason. 
I am gravitating towards b).

Exac my thought. Why not sharing the TXid(s)?
