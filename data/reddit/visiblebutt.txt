Yes, I mean the latter and have edited the original post to make it clearer.  If a person properly secures their private keys, there is no way a hacker can steal them.  For example, I've properly put my bitcoin in cold storage, so there is no way someone can discover my private keys.
That's why I think hacking to discover private keys should be legal.  It separates the weak from their bitcoin.

Don't sweat it.  We've had a rather large runup and are currently in a consolidation phase.  Is normal. 
Soon the moonshot will restart in earnest.

Ha ha ha!  It's time to get long and strong.  This is just a mild pullback that will be forgotten long before bitcoin reaches $1,000 again on its way to $10,000.

This basically mean that bitcoin is going to the moon.  Be strong and go long.

Yes, social engineering and spyware fall under 'hacking'.  Now, let me clarify.  This is not something I would do.  I've never tried to hack before.  I'm just saying that if someone in the bitcoin community falls victim to one of these hacks they shouldn't go to the authorities.  Just recognize that you made a mistake and move on.  We don't need anymore government heat on bitcoin than what we already have.


In such a case, I would not go to the authorities because my loss of bitcoins was due to my own carelessness.  My computers are password-protected and no one can get on them unless I am either careless or let them get on.  In either case, a true libertarian would not go to the authorities for his own mistake.

I think when people start to understand all the multitude of applications for bitcoin the value will explode.  Once people begin to understand that people in China will start buying bitcoin just so they can publish secure messages in the blockchain there is really no limit to how high bitcoin can go.  The demand is just going to be phenomenal.

Which companies pay salary in bitcoin?  That would be my dream job as I would no longer need to convert from worthless fiat to bitcoin.

That baby is forever in your debt.  His or her's college will easily be funded by the growth of that .1 bitcoin over 18 years.

Just another reason to use bitcoin -- the soundest and most secure form of money in the universe.

Every successful phishing attack that I've heard of occurred because the phishee made some kind of mistake.  Most phishing attempts are very lame and you have to be really careless to fall for them.  However, if you lose your identity you pretty much have to go to the authorities to get it straightened out.  
If you allow your bitcoin private info to be phished you don't have to go to the authorities.  Just chalk it up as a learning experience and move on.  No need to get the government involved. 


Shady banks and stock exchanges need to be regulated because there is no alternative.  With bitcoin, you can be your own bank and use localbitcoins.


Credit cards are heavily regulated.  We can keep bitcoin from succumbing to that fate if we just take the time to learn proper security techniques.


2FA costs nothing.  There is no reason not to use it and if you get hacked while not using 2FA, then it is entirely on you.

My guess is that they are going to build a system that revolves around trusted addresses.  This system will allow for an entity (JP Morgan for instance) to advertise its addresses.  Once you do that, you can absract all of the complexity of bitcoin and build systems that allow for the transferring of bitcoin from one entity to another instead of from one untrusted address to another untrusted address.
A system like this would basically allow for ACH- or wire-like transfers using bitcoin.
Edit: Such a system would also allow people to purchase from retailers like Amazon using bitcoin.

You shouldn't be running to the police if you can't figure out how to secure your own home; after all its survival of the fittest.
No, there is a difference.  There is no way that one can make their house 100% secure.  There will always be someone that can break through the defenses.
On the other hand, bitcoin is 100% secure if done properly.  Every bitcoin hack that we hear about is due to some mistake in security.  The number one threat to bitcoin is regulation.  I'm afraid that if people keep running to the police when they get hacked, bitcoin will eventually become over-regulated and useless.  
Let's keep bitcoin free by properly securing our bitcoin and not running to the police or the FBI if we get hacked due to our own mistakes.

I see it differently.  If a person's private keys are not properly secured, then they are free for the taking.  This is in keeping with the spirit of true libertarianism.
