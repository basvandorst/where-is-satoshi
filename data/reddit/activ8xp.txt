Hehe... glad it was him.

Why is this not for IOS?? Quit whining.

I love Goldman eating dicks on this! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:09:03
Everytime I sell .04 the market goes down, I blame that on my sell.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:14:45
I think your joke is going over a lot of people's heads.
You get a hug and a +1 from me!
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:38:13
when BTC hits $10 I'll get you one. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:51:15
I made use of selling @ 17k buying back in   tis a good time to strategic HODL
Got BTC for 25% off, better than the Steam winter sale.
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:06:08
So you take $40 out of the bank and mark down: Crazy ca$h my wife/gf doesn't know about
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:06:49
If you have to remember where your bitcoins went you don't have enough
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:18:26
I gave you a downvote and it FELT good
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:31:38
fuck it have an upvote !
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:21:02
true I'm desperately holding on to my BTC's , surely what goes down must come up. right... right ??
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:09:50
I think he's mindfreaking us all. Fuck it have an up vote 
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:15:29
+1 for the Winklevosses baby. It's been just as easy for me, plus the fees are reasonable.
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:50:30
Total loser, it's true. Sad!
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:51:23
I think there is big time manipulation going on in the market. However no different from the stock market where manipulation and inside tracks reign supreme.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:16:59
Have USD stored on the exchange
@_date: 2017-03-09 00:48:07
Sitting tight while the price drops, where you can sell and reap profits to buy more back. Yeah I'm a noob and you're an idiot. Keep hodling
@_date: 2017-03-01 00:30:14
I don't think the ETF is the make or break thing. It might add more people into the world, but even without the ETF bitcoin will grow.
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:00:34
Sell high, buy low, it makes sense. Just make sure you HODL when it's lift off time.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:49:53
I've been trying to set up limits on Gemini, but so far that has never worked for me.
Like for example. SELL if it drops below $1100 then REBUY if it hits $1000
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:59:33
There's ways to clone a phones 2FA. Just saying.

Redditor for two months, we have a seasoned vet here.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:02:50
I'm using gemini, 0.25% fee. You'll earn that back quickly in a market like this.
Also a great way to strengthen your position. Sell at a higher price, wait for the drop and buy more BTC back, rinse and repeat.
Meanwhile you hodl some too on cold storage like a legder nano.
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:54:36
Like somehow that gives you "cred". Grow up son.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:52:54
I still have 1 ETH left ! Suckers!
@_date: 2017-03-13 02:20:07
I stand corrected. Good practice about the multisig.
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:28:16
Depending on how much the user trades, but normally 0.25%
$3925  a complete joke.
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:55:10
Actual rocket science my friend.
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:52:26
Tell them to go to gemini. Way better option.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:49:40
I think you are right if you look at history.
@_date: 2017-03-06 03:49:18
in long about way you can with Kraken.
Easiest would be to just use your CC at a local ATM in Paris and get Euros out, that's what I do.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:16:23
Yeah Gemini is different, I went back and looked and got conpuzzled again. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:39:33
Thanks. I'll give it another try.. Even better to pick up @ $1000 :D
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:36:05
Chad Rigsby certainly does.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:57:15
you mean he shoudl
@_date: 2017-01-07 15:00:17
Love to make fun of newbies, when you run around all high and mighty with a 5 year "attendance" ! Yay fake internet points.
@_date: 2017-01-08 04:19:41
Hop on board, we're going to the MOON .
@_date: 2017-01-14 00:01:06
Right, I did a cursory google search, cool stuff. Also I like Gemini coming from Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-01-08 04:21:46
I find your enthusiasm contagious ! Let's go to the moon.
 
@_date: 2017-01-08 01:03:31
I signed up for an account on [ today after reading on here it was better than coinbase.
I think coinbase is expensive.
However, I am still in the "Verifying" stage on Gemini since you have to upload an ID and bill with current address.
Have you tried using coinbase in different browsers, always the first step I take. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:20:24
You silly goober, 160 million don't fit on a stick
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:25:05
There's a reason when you watch commercials for stock brokers they state: "May lose money, not guaranteed" Bitcoin ain't no different.
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:10:43
Yeah been reading up on it. Pretty interesting. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 23:31:39
My account was approved in hours, it helps doing crap above board once in a while.
Now, of course, the IRS will be informed about my vast BTC wealth.
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:04:30
If you want guaranteed results bitcoin is not for you. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 04:23:11
I agree wit the annoyance of the price up/down posts. But I've learned to ignore them.
Very glad you're over it, life's too short to be worried about that, don't even click on them anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:41:43
I propose you sell all the BTC you got, life is a gamble. Everything you do all day is a gamble.  if you need to win, you need to quit.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:39:47
Too late was yesterday.
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:19:44
I have tested with *gasp* 0.00025 BTC  activ8xp don't play.
@_date: 2017-01-08 01:01:02
First step in Bitcoin, take it not so serious.  Buy some and cringe when it goes down. Smirk when it goes UP. 
TBH I planned on selling when it hit 1100, However, greedy me... didn't. Ugh. Well that's ok. We're going to the moon regardless.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:22:05
I was mining for bitcoin, had NO clue what the hell it was. Way back in 2010.
Boy, wish I could jump into the DeLorean and fix that.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:12:11
I bought a google wifi access point and some other computer stuff from Newegg, it tickles my fancy to know I paid it with BTC.  Not worried that I paid toooooo much when BTC increases.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:43:33
It just got to 4k. The moon is next.
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:11:11
Yeah what a total loser.
@_date: 2017-04-29 00:16:24
I started mining in 2013. But had no clue really what I was doing. I don't even know where the BTC went I mined. I didn't really care. 
I later bought $200.

Ja, size M here as well. But activ8xp's luck is always to fish behind the net.  Boo hiss.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:16:05
check out Blockfolio app for your phone, it'll give warnings on price slides or preferably hikes ! 
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:11:58
Proper response ! Never too late to jump on, whereas I really hope it goes to 2.5k then 3k and on ! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:09:21
You must be a shitty Ganja farmer.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:06:18
Goodbye coins, what happens with and old fashioned wallet ?
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:14:16
Don't you totally hate you didn't jump in with lets say $1000 4 years ago ?
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:17:41
Yeah it's called the blockchain !
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:41:53
Exactly, I think part of the fun, and heck why not fun, is they can also buy .25 btc and see it go UP. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:06:51
Very true words, I think the majority here didn't get in on the groundfloor and from where we are we cannot even see the top.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:05:19
This is almost heresy on where the Gospel is to HODL
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:09:29
I take offense, I love ETH, been like a second chance at making some serious money. (it was sitting at $10 beginning of year, $200 now.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:57:08
I think I'm selling every BTC I hodl  a day before this alphabet soup starts. Then repurchase after the dust settles.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:11:36
He was asking about the one Trezor.
I have a nano ledge and mycellium on an android phone. I get it.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:43:24
Also, I've stored 5 bitcoin on a Nano Ledger that's in a bankvault, this way I'm not tempted to sell it... or at least it takes effort to do so.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:14:13
Coinbase now has control of your coin, the two factor is to keep "other people" than you out. But not coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:15:00
If you have some money to spend, get a nano ledger S, it holds multiple currencies.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:33:30
No problem.. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:15:29
Ahh... my friend, I was in that same boat.. itchy trigger finger to sell with a 20% raise.
I bought a hardware bitcoin wallet. The nano ledger, it stores BTC as well as ETH (I hold both). 
I don't think any exchange that lets you not have access to your coins for a set time.
So on my nano ledger I have 5 BTC and 25 ETH.  I already had a bank vault, but you could also buy something like this:
 
The trick is to keep you from easily getting to coins and sell them.
    
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:36:46
You are right. I forgot about that. If you hold the "key" the passphrase you can access those. 
I stand corrected.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:19:34
Gemini is slow as molasses to me. Been like that all morning, almost like they don't want you to do anything.
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:38:30
Better to be in Paris than in Detroit, which is more fucked up than Fallujah.
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:18:15
I remember doing something like that on darknet markets.
Blending or tumbling.
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:41:07
Yeah, Bitcoin is supposed to be HODLed. So it never becomes an actually usable currency, because fuck the banks.
How about your motherfuckers do that with your creditcards and carloans, morgages and homeloans. HODL my ass. 
Edit from back to the future in 2036. I can't believe I paid 10k for some beer.
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:39:29
When it comes to beer. Fuck the transaction fee.
