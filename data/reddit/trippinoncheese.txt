So I guess it means that they log how much you own and then transfer the actual coins to another address. 
Is there a way to tell that address pub key? How many of these addresses are there?

Another, maybe simpler solution would be to present the user with some kind of identifying data, before he/she enters the 2FA. 
For example, show the user his/her balance, real name, or a special phrase they used when registering. 
That way, if the hackers do not have access to the website database (which they probably don't), they wouldn't be able to present this data before 2FA.

You mention abstute users and then suggest installing a browser extention (which can be an attack vector by itself).
My offer requires a very simple change from server side: users are required to upload any picture they want, then they know not to login unless they see this picture on the 2FA login screen.

That's a whole other virus you are talking about. 
I was referring to the phishing/DNS override virus OP was suffering from. 
My suggestion would render phishing useless if 2FA is being used. 
edit: But I would love to hear more thoughts about this suggestion.

Can't argue with that. Although I worry every time I enter my username and password, more so after reading OP's problem. 
I would be happy to have a pre-set word that I have made up written on the screen before I enter my 2FA. 
Users can also upload a "Security Picture" when registering. This picture will show every time before 2FA phrase is being entered. It would be pretty obvious if a picture you choose before is not presented on your screen.

You just refuse to understand what people are saying to you. 
Even if only 1 bitcoin remains in the market, it will be worth billions of USD and people will use/trade very (very) small fractions of it.
