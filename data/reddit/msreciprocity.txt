Musicrising.org and The Tipitinas Foundation makes grants to New Orleans schools to purchase musical instruments for low income students...pretty cool.

I'll comment again seeing as we have a ways to go. u/BRAIN thanks for your generosity but you've formatted all your tips wrong. Other users have already added instructions. No coins can flow without using the changetip bot or sending directly to an address posted by a commenter. Still, nice of you, thanks again.

Thanks! That was unexpected :)

Heifer international ( United Cerebral Palsy (ucp.org) Foundation and Magdalene House at Thistle Farms (thistlefarms.org) are my favorite charities. Have yet to actually receive a tip in one of these threads but will pass it on if I do.
