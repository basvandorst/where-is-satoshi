Bisq is excellent.  I have never used an exchange again since I first used Bisq and I never will.
With Lightning it would be even more amazing.

Use Bisq it's much better than localbitcoins or any centralised exchange.

Just place an offer with no markup and it is up to others if they choose to take it or not.  Any time that I have used Bisq I have 0% markup and my offer has been taken fairly quickly.

Can they not use a decentralized exchange like Bisq?    I have used it a few times and never had any problems so I don't see why it could not work for people in China.  I think there could be more decentralized exchanges like this popping up in the future now to cater for people in countries who try to ban crypto.

Yes it uses multisig.  Read up on it.  It is a very good platform for buying and selling crypto.  Like I have said earlier, I have used it a few times now without any issues.  If I can help it I will not use centralized exchanges again.

China had a much bigger effect on the price drop than Dimon.
Bitcoiners don't hate him, they think he is a clown.
They laugh at him.

Yeah don't worry about it. 
It happens to other guys too.

It,s kinda like arguing with a child and when they run out of things to say and finally see that they are wrong then they reply with.....  "yeah well you're stupid"

Just forget about exchanges and go p2p.
I use Bisq 
I am not sure if you can use credit card as I use sepa bank transfer but I have used bisq a few times now and I would never use an exchange again.

Yeah but Apple have been around since 1976.  That's 41 years.  Imagine what Bitcoin will be worth when it is 41 years old. :-)
