yeah, btc really needs more baghodlers. btc isnt a currency do for the price to rise we need more people to buy-in at higher price than we did!

why does get to talk about ltc and other shitcoins, side-channels, off-chain "solutions" but not other versions of bitcoin?

Great rebuttal. Spoken like a true authoritarian. Bitcoiners tend to appreciate free markets, free of regulation and central planning. I mistook you for such a person.

Blockstream not doing so well. Samson, Greg and other devs gone. I wonder if Adam got a part-time job and this is his ad?

bcash? the erc20 token for gambling? 
But your claim that BCH is "traitorous" is not supported by objective considerations. Bitcoin (cash) is a version of Bitcoin just like Bitcoin (segwit) is a  version. The former is useful as a currency while the latter is not (drastically higher fees that "leaders" pop champagne to celebrate). 
Use the one you want. For p2p electronic cash there is a cheaper, faster version. Up to you!

Who are you you tell people what to do with their money or which pool to use!

That' the stupidest thing I've read here..and there is a lot of stupid things. You obviously have no economic sense. CB and RV continue to do great things for Bitcoin. Are news stories about them that triggering to you?
