I'm glad you like it!

Fair point, I probably wrote it in Swedish notation :D
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:28:09
Thanks! I see, I might be able to get some functionality inspiration there. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:16:17
Thanks, that's the direction I went for with the design!
I've actually designed my code to allow for multiple currencies, it could easily adapt to different sites/exchanges as well. Given that they publish their data that is. Could you elaborate which sites you're looking for?

I'm hacking on a cool Bitcoin widget for Android as a hobby project (no ads or so), hopefully someone will find it useful here. It updates itself every 15 minutes during your active hours, so it doesn't drain your battery. I just updated it with some stuff that got suggested by fellow redditors last week.
If you'd like to try it and leave some feedback:  - please drop a comment or a review if you got any suggestions, cheers me up to see your reactions.
I got my first ~50 users from Reddit last week that tried it out, and 80% of them are still using the app, so I believe they like it.

Hey thanks! I hope you like it! 
Could you easily understand the configuration options when adding a widget? Hopefully it makes sense to others than me haha

I coded an Android BTC widget app (that doesn't suck). Started out as a personal hack, but it might come in good use to someone else here: It shows the daily/weekly rate change, current rate, and optionally your investments if you add them. There are no ads or anything, would be cool if someone likes it: 
It's better than many of the other widget tickers imho. Try it out and give some feedback.

Thanks happy you like it! Google has free Android courses if your in for a challenge 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:38:14
Gotcha, I'll try to not overdo it ;) thx!

You earned this! Live the moment

It's the limit for updating widgets in Android, so you can also tap the widget any time to instantly update it

I just tried posting about my bitcoin widget for the first time, got instantly downvoted.. I guess other redditors view similar posts as promotion if there isn't a "I'm 16" or "am I going to get downvoted?" in the title :/
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:34:25
That's the limit in android, widgets are limited to updating about every 15 mins! So, as a fallback, you can just tap the widget to instantly update whenever you want ;)

Awesome!

Unfortunately not, people tend to reupload my stuff when I do which I find mildly frustrating :/ It's written in Kotlin and I use Lottie for the animations so it's a pretty fun code base to work with. I usually open source when I move toward my next projects, you can sub to my Github

Thanks for you feedback, I started outlining a design for the medium widget in a 2x1 grid earlier today actually. Thought about adding a little graph to illustrate the change in the chosen timespan (I have the data available so why not draw it). 
What additional info would be useful to you?
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:05:06
USD, EUR so far
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:21:44
Awesome that was my goal! Could you elaborate on what customization options you'd find useful?
