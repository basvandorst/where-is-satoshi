Gold is also largely useless as a currency. Who is talking about Gold?
BTC is largely pointless and failed as a currency.  The blockchain is exciting stuff that will live on.  But the currency use of BTC is tiny compared to its use as a speculative token.

Awesome anecdote!

All crypto is just fiat on a blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:01:48
Fiat just means that the currency is called into exiatence with no asset backing it.  Crypto is called into existence by often a single person and is not backed by any assett.  
What finite resource backs BTC?  Energy?  LOL
BTC was created by Satoshi's command (fiat).

Deflationary currency wont ever work.  BTC isnt working as a currency.  It is a speculative token.  Look at the pathetically small amount of commerce happening relative to per-unit value.

True, but this is the kinda thing that limits BTC to a very small number of people.
And I am seeing hundrds of unconfirmed transactions at greater than 300 s/b here:
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:23:01
Look at those transactions fees lately.  Brutal.  More than 150,000 unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:21:28
Same boat for me, Ive got 1.5 BTC waiting to confirm.  
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:01:30
Sure, but that doesnt mean that it isnt failing as a currency.  It is making a fine speculative token though.

The bigger issue is built in deflation.  There can be little commerce and no credit market denominated in BTC.

If our wallet is still broadcasting the unconfirmed transction, does this extend the 2 week limit in the mempool?
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:21:13
From the outside perspective, nobody cares whose fault it is.  BTC is not functioning well and the process is extremely opaque for many users.
Over 1 million unconfirmed transactions currently, with hundreds over 300 s/b
Edit: 150k, not 1 million
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:01:50


Why can't we trust our wallets to suggest the correct fee?
