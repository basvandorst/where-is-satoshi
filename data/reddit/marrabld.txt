You have 100 but with 50x leverage, you are actually putting in 100/50 so your investing $2 of your own money.  So 30% gain is about 60¢
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:57:14
Nope. Read my comment above. Xbt is a contract worth $1 USD. That you purchase with your BTC.  If you buy 100xbt with 50x leverage, you are buying 100 contracts for $2 and borrowing $98.

I was up 200%. Then I got drunk and greedy. Chased my losses and failed.  It wasn't a huge sum of money but a huge lesson learned.  Taking some time away now until the market starts to trend again.  Next time I'll be more disciplined.

Good on you for taking the plunge.  I would argue Reddit isn't the best place to ask for advice.   Start here [  Lots of content, free course and lots of videos that can help you.
@_date: 2019-02-02 11:19:42
You can only question something if you're informed. This video doesn't say what you think it does troll.  I'm a scientist, I question everything after collecting data and knowledge.

You're a fool. I'm not suggesting you blindly follow him. I'm saying you can't have an informed opinion without seeing his content. If you don't want to watch it, don't. But don't jump to conclusions.  Alex has one of the most informative and thoroughly researched channels on YouTube. It's a shame you'll never never know why.  This community would be better off with constructive criticism and discussion rather that you're toxic drivel. I'll say no more.

If you have no idea what you're doing, don't get your advice from Reddit.  Invest in your education first. Try[someone like this]( But don't take my advice from me either, take the time to find an educator you like. Take your time and don't FOMO.
