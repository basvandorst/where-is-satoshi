I understand what you're saying. If you're not concerned with the return on your investment then it makes sense to prioritize the less tangible aspects of bitcoin. 
Full disclosure - I have a finance background, and ROI is more important to me than the theoretical mass adoption of bitcoin.

Just because you're not a fancypants investor with a portfolio doesn't mean you should disregard rational thought when you're buying into something that appreciates/depreciates in value. If you own bitcoin, you're an investor. It also doesn't mean you should disregard investing fundamentals like diversification and having a realistic exit strategy. 
It's exactly like trading equities. It's easy to buy stock. The tough part is knowing when to sell. If you're lucky enough to see a significant return on a bitcoin investment, considering its ridiculous volatility, you should be thrilled in the first place. Take your profits and run. If you're still in the game because of greed/idealism rather than sensible analysis and strategy, I won't have any sympathy when the next big crash inevitably comes.

I'm a bit of both - I'm a finance student who follows tech news quite closely. I'm not a professional trader by any means, but that's the line of work I'd like to get into. Disclosure - I currently don't own any bitcoin, as it's far too volatile for my liking at the moment, as the most recent crash so clearly demonstrated.

One of the first rules of trading is to never let a loser get out of hand. Don't try to make a profit on a bad trade, just find the best place to get out.

It's the kind of lesson that most people typically learn the hard way. It can be extremely difficult to separate emotion from objective thinking when you're watching a large position hemorrhage value.
