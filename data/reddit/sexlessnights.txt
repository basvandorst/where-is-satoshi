Work. 
We rent out hotel rooms by the year so I have rigs set up there. Also back at the office in dead/ low traffic spaces.

With a 24/7 set up and free electricity + internet you can break even in 6 months. For me this includes a fancy rig frame, several 1080s, dual power supplies and dedicated mobo, aux fans etc... 
Personally I use day trading gains to pay for hardware and then I hold the profits from mining.

Edited comment. I see the similarities to our current financial system. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:35:14
This still pertains to a checking account. 
I can close it whenever I want. If I owe money it remains open. If the bank goes under the government guarantees the money.

This sounds cheap. 
Can we get a market analysis for Houston, TX. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:03:13
So we are opening tabs with everyone. Got it. 
On a serious note this is no different than having a checking account with a debit card. The safe is your checking account and you can spend with the debit card. A bank verifies the current balance and transaction during a swipe. So a bank like entity will probably House this “bitcoin safe” l think we just came full circle.

Look at the correlation between the bar graphs and line graph.

And fuck up their data
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:38:18
That’s pretty much it. You keep your piece as proof of purchase and they get the tab which is then traded for a different bill.  
When you sell the cow you’ll then get that smaller piece again (from the new buyer) which means you’ll have a complete trillion dollar bill.
