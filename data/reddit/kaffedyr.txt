Thus far in 2018 we have been holding bags. New and greater fools are required to turn the table.

IMO taking out profits to cover your initial investment is a great idea at this point, especially if you bought under 10k. You now have lost nothing and future HODLing through the rollercoaster should be mentally easier; it's all bonuses from here on out. Sleep well at night and truly enjoy the ride. I wish you a good trip and remember to buy the dips to come:)

I wasn't being offending:P It takes time to do the homework. Also don't take investment advice from Reddit seriously; I assume you care about your money.

But the true HOLDORS never take out profit no matter new ATH level. This cult sub has gone too radical with this concept. You are effectively bagholders and your money will soon enough change hands to institutional players and whales. Don't feed the suits

A lot of weak hands (including myself) holding Bitcoin right now. By 'weak hands' I mean people not fully indoctrinated in the HODL religion and who will attempt to take profit off of dips ahead by selling high (on the way down; reinforcing the dip) and buying low (on the way up; reinforcing upwards price action). Empirically, this will not serve them well but it's human nature. Add to that, we're basically at the mercy of enormous whales that can obliterate buy walls down to 10k easily if they push the issue and decide to cash out instantly. I expect bipolar RSI-measures and severe but short-lived dips in the weeks ahead: we will probably bounce back up immediately since investors just see it as major discount and buy more:) 
TLDR; demand for Bitcoin is still real and growing, just more speculation in the game

Uhh I was under impression that Coinbase will only be liable to refund fiat (not crypto) you may have stored on their exchange if they are hacked. You may want to read over terms of service again

Do your own resarch (DYOR). Investing in crypto is the deepest rabbit hole I've ever ventured down into. Requires a lot of research if you're going to succeed. Start here. Read white papers, road maps, dev team names, project niche, competitors. Diversify based on your own ROI projections and risk profile.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:30:29
Yes it never leaves your wallet. Wait 2 weeks

Keep calm and take profits at 9.9k. Remain calm and buy the reversal. HODL = bagholding nowadays

The color of mass adoption is green? I'm bearish on this subreddit, keep seeing lower lows

Main argument: The lagging indicator Google trends "Bitcoin" -- that actually corresponds better to hyperbolic bubble climax -- just isn't there yet. Congrats if you're buying now before the general public imo.

Everyone is free to pay their pizza or Steam games with BTC. Burn the receipts so it doesn't sting so much when you look back some years from now and BTC is potentially 500k.

ASIC only, or would it significantly matter if all the average Joes in the community threw their high-end cpus (or gpus) at it? As I understand it, the Chinese miners pretty much have us by the balls and we're banking on keeping BTC mining more profitable than BCH, appealing to their greed. If their political motives prevail BTC is screwed. Current PoW solution is not viable long-term. All hands on deck? Would 1 million gaming rigs and desktop computers make a difference? Just curious

Volume candles for the latest rally since early February (Tradingview, BTC/USD, Coinbase, Daily) are now MASSIVELY bigger than when I checked earlier this week. 
Previously, the biggest candle in the pack was the February 6th bottoming. Today when I check Tradingview, February 6th is an *average volume* candle in the current rally. WTF!!
Edit: put you tinfoil hats on if you want to believe this is organized market manipulation by Coinbase, suspiciously coinciding with release of their [Custody institutional buyer platform]( Give the suits two weeks head start?

Revolution was called off in favor of *when moon/lambo* memes. Don't expect too much cypherpunk shills from this subreddit nowadays:)

I've seen some interesting points last few days hinting towards a bullish sentiment developing:
1. Volume candles (Tradingview, Coinbase BTC/USD, daily) were "updated" yesterday. I was worried about the lack of volume on the current reversal but now it looks actually pretty solid.
2. News cycle: Coinbase opened up the Custody institutional investor platform. Establishment of the SEC-compliant Circle trading platform, opening up for big money into crypto. No FUD about crypto regulations on the news anymore; the issue seems mostly resolved for China, USA and South-Korea.
3. Reverse head-and-shoulders pattern symmetrical around February 6th IF we can get up over 12k real soon.
4. We are well over EMA9 and MA100 on the daily. Different length moving averages crossing bullishly.
5. If Elliot waves apply to this run, we may be in wave 3 currently and should crush upwards this week. Long-term iterative (year-over-year) Elliot waves have price target 25k or something in 2018.
6. Fundamentals are even stronger than last year now with Segwit implementation and Lightning network being figured out. This is important because what is now the point with Bcash, Nano, Litecoin et al?
7. Bitcoin dominance percentage of total crypto marketcap has increased to 41% 
Watch a lot of youtube technical analysis, follow news + your guts and decide for yourself:)
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:32:26
So true
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:14:21
What do you make of the current BTC/USD chart? New bull-run from current retrace level Fib 0.382 (~9,5k) or bounce off 0.618 (~8.1k)? We are so far under the daily EMA9 I have a feeling the latter one, or somewhere in between.
@_date: 2018-03-04 09:48:43
I would certainly read up on [Andreas Antonopoulos]( and his essays on the subject of Bitcoin. No one explains it better imo. Edit: the man wrote a book that you probably want to read
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:35:35
I guess somebody just pressed Market buy and shoved us up over daily EMA9 :P This should be interesting
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:15:34
Get a notion on what the RSI (Tradingview overlay indicator; relative strength index) should look like for a true reversal to happen during oversold conditions in crash. Decide beforehand a cutoff for daily, 1hr and 15min RSI and commit to that trade if it plays out. Is what I'm gonna do, I ain't chasing falling knives:)

Checks out. Aligns with moving average MA314, the cyclical market herald indicator theorized by the great Arab mathematician Ten-x Pi.
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:45:35
No volume and RSI (&lt;2h) at oversold roof before we even got going up. Now seeing a repeat of the fractal meme from ~2 weeks ago and the exact same head&amp;shoulders formation leading up to the proceeding dump. I could be wrong but I don't see this going anywhere unless whale pump comes out of nowhere. The dead cat bounces on down for now.
