i hesitated ever since knowing about bitcoin in 2010, bought in at the start of the boom this year for a reasonably good price, cashed out in april crash.
Having considered things a bit more, I have just bought in a small amount again, along with even smaller amounts of litecoin and ripple just to keep my fingers in the pies. 
The main thing i've learned is that it's going to be a long game. I am buying in now without even considering the option of cashing out in the forseeable future. Money that goes in is money lost in my mind, not to be worried about (which is why it's such a small amount!) No more gambling - this is now endorsement.

I think it possibly has has something to do with the widely accepted notion that younger people are more interested in revolutionary ideas by and large. 
They are not so set in their ways, are interested in how their generation is going to change the social landscape and of course have less invested in the current systems.
Furthermore, younger people tend to have have a greater understanding and interest in new technology in general. I would not be surprised if the overall average age of a bitcoin trader is about 10-20 years younger than that of forex.

Bitcoin is worth what people believe it is worth. Part of the reason i assume we are all so interested in it is because this is new territory with very little in the way of precise predictions. The best you can honestly guess is when it goes up in value sharply, people jump on the gravy train. When it goes down, people jump off, thus "bubbles".
Anyway, I, for one shall be buying the shit out of bitcoin if the price stays low until my next payday as i believe it to have a future. Believe being the word. No one knows.

- 4chan - often purposefully misleading for the benefit of "lulz"
- most Newscorp publications and publications - often purposefully misleading for the benefit of "sensationalism"
The comment was referring to the point that 4chan is not a reliable source. To expand my point, I was responding by saying that much of the gutter newspapers and channels are often no better. Newscorp are the most prolific in this field.
The Sun, for instance, has been caught in the last few months (and this is since the NotW scandal) simply making up news stories with absolutely no source. This has happened for decades and newscorp clearly aren't too interested in preventing such cases, which undermines the whole group's credibility (which regularly shows its colours!).
The (thowaway) joke was - why not believe something said on 4chan, the accepted news is often just as made up. Exaggeration? Yes. A stereotype. Stereotypes are a staple of satire.
I think you took this all a little too seriously. As have I now. Boo.

"Hyperbolically ridiculous" - since when is it wrong to hyperbolise? Hyperbole is not the inherently bad thing you are implying.

I think you need to stop. You have currently lost less than you could do. Gambling is not something to do if you need the money you're hoping to win or planning on spending. It sounds dangerous.
If you're going to do it whatever happens, do it yourself, but be clever. You're safest to shove it on satoshidice 50% with a [roulette system]( of some sort. Look at all of them down the left on that page and figure out how much risk you're willing to take.

There are two reasons to have bitcoins:
- To spend readily, in which case, buy as you need them or risk losing out.
- For long term interest - years rather than months.
