You will either lose or gain money.

Nice try.

Hold On for Dear Life.

Or, buy a suit with bitcoin worth $1k today, tomorrow it's worth $500. You just ripped off the suit seller. Shame on you.

Tracking serials on bills for common exchanges would be a monstrous task and waste of labor.

I'm sure banks do, but I don't think they can track transactions, just what bank the bills originated from.

If bitcoin hits $100k, everyone thinks they will be rich. This is an impossibility. The price of a cheeseburger at McDonald's would skyrocket to $1000 a piece. Sure you'd have more "money", but your wealth would be the same, and your financial situation would not change. 
Tl;dr. Bitcoin will not make millionaires out of low to middle class citizens. It's impossible.

I can check for errors. What's the recovery phrase?

Just put your bitcoins in a dark place, give them some alcohol, put on Marvin Gaye and let them do their thang. You should see more bitcoin roughly 9 months later.

"Leaked, unconfirmed, planning on." 
Nothing to see here, move along.

My thoughts exactly...

Wrong. It will either cost more, or less.

Exactly. You could never buy from a merchant/store with bitcoin without being taxed. You would have to buy from an individual to get around the taxes.
