Yeah, it would be helpful UX wise. But its also interesting you could sort of have a private channel with someone. 
Let's say person A and B have a private channel and no other open channels. Person B then opens a new channel to a hub with thousands of channels open. If person C is also connected to that hub, and wanted to send money to person A, would it route through person B then?

With supply and demand. Anarchism, free association. The whole tax system should be blockchain based and voluntary. Don't want to pay tax? Pay retail price for public services. And, you fund the parts of society you want to support by paying tax to those projects. The entire tax system will obviously be decentralized and use smart contracts for maximum transparency and minimizing the chances of government corruption. I am totally for pooling money together to accomplish something (modern taxation). I am totally against pooling money together and hoping self-serving politicians will use it wisely while coercing us to keep funding them (medieval taxation).

In the case of crypto, no one would see the potential until they understand the technology. It's like showing a cowboy a car. "What, you need to build roads to use it? You need to drill for oil and refine it? Steel production? I have a horse that eats grass and takes me anywhere, a car is useless." The beauty is that those who take their time to understand crypto end up going long, which validates the technology and potential. It's just like how peer review validates scientific propositions which eventually make it into everyday society in the form of contraptions and whatnot.

@_date: 2018-01-13 17:05:07
The thing about crypto is that governments can try all they want to ban it, but they can't enforce that ban. If holders of crypto fully understood this and were willing and eager to ditch the government, it wouldn't affect prices. But since most holders are speculating I'm sure it would hugely affect the prices. Bitcoin is still in early price discovery mode, eventually no news will affect its price.

I don't think usage is shrinking. I think speculation is shrinking due to the market contraction. What you see now is the actual usage while exchange related transactions are down, which probably were the bulk to begin with. This is the case for all cryptos since there is yet any large scale real world implementation of POS (point of sale) for crypto. When most people talk about transaction fees they aren't really transacting besides moving between exchange and wallet. Remove the speculation and you see what the real world usage for crypto looks like today.

You solve this with tax rules. Just create a blockchain of taxation contracts. Let's say you have a virtual country and a real small town (countries are always a form of illusion, a town is not, you can live in it). The town is located within the proposed vritual country. The local tax contracts will vary depending on the local needs. If your city needs schools and you want your kids to go in them, you allocate the towns required tax rate to that. If your town wants to benefit from what the virtual country offers, perhaps protection , your town also pays tax into that. The point isn't that in anarchism you can't have governments, assemblies and so forth. The point is for this to be voluntary, and for people who live together to agree to terms without coercing those who don't want to participate.
I have visited several anarchist towns and studied how they operate. You can go an live there without interacting with anyone and won't be hassled. You can keep to yourself. But, humans also like to collaborate. If you want to participate in collaboratory efforts or benefit from them, the people will ask you to contribute. If there's free food within the society and you want some, perhaps you have to pay for it or help with harvesting. It just puts much more emphasis on human beings' natural attraction to collaboration and lets them organize this freely without relying on a centralized coercive power structure that forces people to participate.

And when you sell Bitcoin on Bisq, you just wait for the wire deposit then release the coins. Then, your bank calls you saying the funds have been fraudulently sent to you from someone's hijacked internet bank and freezes the funds. You'll then have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that you transacted in good faith. The lack of ID verification and comparing the sender's bank account name with a photo ID or similar will not make recovering your frozen funds easy. Wire fraud scams are really common today.

Upset at a protocol? Bitcoin has hit a scaling limit and there are multiple solutions being worked on, perhaps too technical for you but Lightning, Segwit and Schnorr signs are going to change this. Bitcoin's primary utility isn't low fees, it's decentralization and censorship resistance. Now that we have hit a bottleneck there are fixes being developed to address them. Most alts are cheap because no one is using them. Hitting a scaling limit means you have proved your utility and now you need to work on improving scaling.

You need to learn about supply and demand. Do you want a bitcoin? Try getting one. You can't afford to mine it, and they can't be had "out of thin digital air". Demand for Bitcoin is huge and supply is limited and scarce. Math ensures that. Demand is up which is why it's expensive.

Everybody doesn't hold. A percentage of all bitcoin owners are holders however. Most of the recent price increase was due to speculators buying in. Holders might not have bought since they could spot it was non-organic growth. When the market crashed and all those speculators sold out, the holders waited for the price to drop until they deemed it good to buy more. So, the people with hold mentality bought cheap coins from the panic sellers, thus lifting the price yet again but the coins are now held by strong hands (hodlers) instead of weak hands (speculators).

So if I buy a future for 1 Bitcoin for January 31, and I pick it up for $16,000. On January 31, Bitcoin is worth $27,000. I first pay up the remainder 50-70% of the future to total $16,000. The future seller then credits me $27,000 (since it's cash settled and not Bitcoin settled) and I make $11,000, so far so good. 
My question then is, who is the typical seller of a future? The seller can in theory never hold the underlying asset? And even if they did, Bitcoin rewards long positions / hodlers. 
So it seems you could hodl Bitcoin and still play on the futures market as a seller. If you end up having to fill a 1 BTC order for $16,000 and the coin is worth $27,000, you might not even sell your underlying asset and just pay from your cash reserves, since Bitcoin is posed to keep rising due to the network effect.
What I'm getting at is even the futures market encourages hodling since a seller would be better off holding his Bitcoin and settling in cash, rather than selling his Bitcoin and then settling in cash.

If you peg fiat to Bitcoin, it isn't Bitcoin that's going up in value, it is fiat that is going down in value. The more people move into Bitcoin the less the need for banks and traditional financial institutions. 3rd world countries are great examples of where the government might be inclined to ban bitcoin as they loose control. Governments enforce bans with prisons and pistols. Yes it would be a good time to buy but such and event would scare lots of hands to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:12:44
If you look at the history of Bitcoin, it always crashed following a confidence test. When no tests of confidence came, it kept on rising. The last real test was the SEC declining the ETF at the beginning of the year. It dipped, then turned around and has been growing ever since. There will be news sooner or later that causes a major correction and then it will keep going up. I expect the next test of confidence will be when the government starts cracking down.

All you need to do is keep hodling and buy the dips. The more it crashes the more I will buy and so will lots of others. Again, remember and focus on the fundamentals (long term strengths) of Bitcoin and ignore the FUD (short term weakness). If you do this, downward price movements will be buying opportunities instead of panic selling opportunities.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:40:05

I think the shorting futures for fast buck only would work with Cboe and Gemini (and I could be wrong about that too). But from my understanding Cboe only relies on Gemini for pricing Bitcoin. If you sell enough Bitcoin on Gemini (only one exchange) causing the price to drop, it will also drop the Cboe futures price, since it is based on Gemini's price. You make money on the sell, and you make money on the short sell. It only works if the hedge fund already has sufficient amount of Bitcoin to move the market, but I read that several funds have been accumulating Bitcoin since the start of the year. But, the price drop might be arbitraged away quickly if all other exchanges are unaffected, so I'm not sure if this would work in practice.

If you create the charity yourself then its a great idea. I am however opposed to donations to charities such as the Red Cross as the money never reaches those who need it and you offload the responsibility of making the world better by giving the money to others and trusting them to do it for you. Lots of charities just operate on other people's guilt and have no real interest in making the world better. But it sounds like you guys are actively participating which is good!

Bitcoin needs shit like Bitcoin Cash, shilling, FUD, etc to get battle tested. If it can't withstand such forces it is indeed worthless. Don't fear these things, it can only make Bitcoin stronger if it truly is what it purports (and I believe) to be (look at fundamentals). However, I highly doubt crashing the entire crypto market could have something to do with Roger Ver at al. And if it does, then again, the market needs these tests to become fully censorship resistant and tamper proof.

Your next moves should be hodling. Time in the market beats timing the market, ESPECIALLY if you are a noob.

Buy it and say fuck it. Just buy what you can afford. If it goes down, just hold and remember that you said "fuck it". There's no other way. Unless you're a professional day trader, but it sounds like you are trying to hold for the long term so just get on in. I waited for a long time to buy Monero. I was looking at it around $90, then $130, $160, $200. I didn't buy, waiting for the dip. Finally I said "fuck it" and bought at $280. If it dips or crashes, so be it. I wanted to own some, and now I do. We'll see how it goes later on, but obviously if you believe in the fundamentals of the instrument (and your strategy) just go for it.

I offered these little metal pieces to a vendor in order to buy food. I offered 50% more by exchange rate. The vendor had no interest in these metal pieces, to him they were useless since he didn't plan on going to Country B to spend them. A chunk of cheese for a fraction of the cost would have been more useful to him since he could've used it to make and sell more food for example. In the end I was gifted a pancake. True story.

Things are going amazingly well. The internet pretend money BTC is still  costs over $6,000 and does what it always did and nothing else; ensures the integrity of it's ledger without fault. It's worth $6,000 (up from 0) because people are recognizing it sticks and keeps on keeping. 
Take something like ETH on the other hand. It was inflated because of heavy ICO spending. Its value proposition is complicated and has mostly just resulted in ERC20 tokens. 
Bitcoin is a clear winner because it never tried to be more than what it is, and it does what it is supposed to do extremely well. I'm bullish on its future.

Yes, I did the same yesterday. I moved it to Coinomi and had some pleasant Shapeshift experience instead. The only thing I liked with Kraken was the ability to hold, deposit and withdraw Fiat. But their website has been unusable for a very long time. I lost a big amount of money on their absolutely shitty platform last year when the SEC decided against a Bitcoin ETF. Since then their exchange has been crippled. I don't know if Kraken will turn into some type of exit scam but I would be very careful as they have CONSTANT errors, cloudflare 502/504/540 errors and so forth. All I got for my losses was useless Kraken credits that don't even seem to work. I would advise people to stay far away from them as trading there can cost you a literal fortune.

They are a bit more expensive, but it depends on what you are trying to do. Since I am a hodlr I am willing to pay for the convenience and not having to move back and forth to an exchange. If I was day trading I would absolutely not use either Shapeshift or Changelly. But if all I wanted was to buy some Vert coin to hold for a few years, it would be worth not involving the exchange.

BCH is pointless as it's a cetralized scam by a few billionaires. If you want low fees and ultra fast transactions, use Ethereum! It is way faster AND cheaper than BOTH BTC and BCH. BCH is nothing but a hostile takeover attempt and I am not surprised (if true) that China backs it.

BTC is the most basic use case for crypto. It's the most decentralized and longest running blockchain with the brightest people working on it. If Bitcoin, which is the most bare bones crypto with very strong fundamentals legitimizing the use case for a blockchain in the first place, goes to 0, the experiment has failed. ETH is Bitcoin and then some. Bitcoin is the proof of concept that gives alt coins a baseline value. If bitcoin fails, the crypto fundamentals have failed.

Blockchain isn't a useful technology without the underpinnings as embodied by bitcoin. The point is for it to be trustless, censorship resistant and decentralized. The blockchain was invented to enable this. It's not a technology race. It's a trust in the protocol race. If people don't trust the bitcoin protocol, why would they trust any other protocol? The technology isn't what gives it value, it is the human trust in the incorruptibility of the protocol.
Finally, there is no lack of innovation in Bitcoin, quite the contrary. Such a statement makes you seem like a troll. If you know what goes on in bitcoin you know it is innovating A LOT.

It lets merchants tap into crypto asset holders. What merchants do with the crypto has no bearing on the fact it makes the crypto economy more viable as all the crypto holders can now use their coins for purchases. Once merchants can pay their distributors with crypto the need to convert to fiat becomes lower. Once manufacturers accept crypto for payment the distributors no longer need to change into fiat. There's nothing wrong with this proposal and is a natural step towards more utility for crypto assets besides trading them.

How to regulate Bitcoin
1. KYC/AML required for authorized exchanges
2. KYC/AML required for authorized banking solutions
3. KYC/AML required for authorized merchant solutions
1. Official exchanges have federal protections and insurance
2. Bangking solutions have federal protections and insurance
3. Merchant solutions have federal protections and insurance
To benefit from federal regulation and guarantees by becoming authorized, exchanges, banking solutions and merchant solutions need regulatory compliance such as reserves, security, audits and other methods currently enforced on regular financial institutions.
Users are thus *incentivized* to use authorized players because they will benfit from regulation and safety and insurance. Users can still use their own wallet, transact on Local Bitcoins or directly with merchants (just like they can keep cash in a safe, trade with indiviudals or buy items with cash). 
Regulation thus becomes an incentive rather than a hindrance, and a compliment to the Bitcoin economy rather than a suffocating force.

In the beginning that means pricing goods and services in USD (like today) with a floating bitcoin price. The incentive to accept bitcoin for payment is to tap into the wealth of crypto holders. Eventually suppliers will accept BTC and merchants can then make purchases without converting to USD. The desire to hold sales made in BTC as BTC will also go up thanks to the scarcity of the asset. Bitcoin will stabilize some day, and this is the road to get there. A price in the hundreds of thousands per bitcoin will reflect this change.

Yeah, very true. USDT can never be equal to 1 USD unless the US Government / Mint / Treasury officially backs it. The purchasing power of 1 USD is greater than 1 USDT. However, on the flipside, the purchasing power of 1 USDT is greater than 1 USD in the crypto space, since liquidity in crypto is so restricted these days. However, I guess that restriction is be discounted in the overall price of crypto (the price is low because new money can't easily flow in), so... First assumption still holds true.

If the censorship resistance depends on people being ethical and loyal, Bitcoin is a total failure. Nothing in Bitcoin was designed to rely on goodwill, quite the opposite.
