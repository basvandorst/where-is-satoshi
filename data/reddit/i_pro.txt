Stand alone. Be brave.  Maybe lose it all, on your terms.  You have the choice.

Sorry pal, I'm not taking responsibility for your decisions.  Whatever you decide to do, own it and be prepared if it goes to zero.

Your mobile phone wallet is off of the exchange that facilitates trading the bitcoin for USD. 
The amount of bitcoin is static in your wallet.  To sell/use the bitcoin you need to find a goods purvayor or service provider that accepts X bitcoin for the goods or service.  
Or, you need to send it back to any exchange to exchange it for USD.

It is supposed to do both on the same day. up down up down up down. It gives the down (bear) a market to play with so there is more push pull.  Basically it means people can make money when the price of bitcoin drops.  Which means it is going to go bananas.  
Hopefully, with proper adoption, eventually, price will trend up.
Your question is not a bitcoin question fundamentally.  Go learn about derivatives markets

Bitcoin is not anti-age. So immature of you to feel like it is. 
Be grateful the other people around you demonstrate the right way to act  in the world.   
Respect your elders
Yeet Yeet.

I have a qnap server I could use auto ssh on my physical server and avoid the $5 per month vps correct?
On the other hand, constant uptime is worth $5 a month and also, setting it up is easy on zap ⚡️ wallet website.

Dr. Peterson has a fresh take on responsibility fleshed out in his book maps of meaning that meshes well with the responsibility of managing your private keys in the bitcoin-o-sphere.
I always felt like I take on the role of banker when I move my coins off exchange.  I’m responsible, it’s empowering.
Fight back against the centralized bank system, the HSBCs and Patreons of the world.
Distribute the load to the nodes. If everyone does the hard work of pressing adoption up the hill we have unbounded potential to progress. 
Dr. Peterson is taking on the burden, willingly, to help move the needle on adoption. 
What will you do?
