This is a millionaires house not a billionaires.

fezzuk please stop embarrassing yourself dude. I'm British and can safely say 1 Billion equals 1000 millions or 9 zero's. And yes millionaires do buy houses worth tens of millions. Lots of celebrities are worth significantly more than a 10 million pound house but are still no where close to being billionaires.

Very unlikely to be owned by a billionaire. There are thousand of houses like this in London and very few billionaires.

i feel like if i buy now and it falls in a week i'll be pissed off but i'm going to be equally pissed of if it keeps on rising and doesn't stop

I have £100 to spend.

I did that before BTG and didn't get any free Bitcoin gold.

Broke but have about $200 per month disposable income which i'm currently saving up to buy a car. I figure i may as well throw it into bitcoin if it's just going to be collecting no interest in a bank anyway...

i honestly dont know if theirs going to be another one... this thing seems like it's left earths atmosphere already

Seems like they missed the boat with Primecoin.

Never going to happen.

Doesn't seem to have hurt the price.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:16:19
Your rant is bullocks because clearly you don't own any Bitcoin you mug.
