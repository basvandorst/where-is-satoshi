Cult preaching about cult is not a cult at all but a way of life?

I haven't seen proof other than a lot of hot air. Person who wishes to remain anonymous uses his real name...Does not add up but media is mediastupid and will feed this info everywhere. And "pseudo confirming" their findings you're not helping this person.

One word COPS. Use them that reads like a threat and there are logs they can get to that you cannot. Regardless if it reads that someone with amoeba skill level wrote it.

Haven't been on ZH for over a year so I read over an article about gold vs btc and then looked at the comment section. Doomers one and all there and very hateful people. They talk about zealotry of BTC yet can't see their own fervor when defending gold because it is physical. Ugh.. I used to like that site.
