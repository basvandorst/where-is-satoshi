If they close registration because of overwhelming volume of new sign ups, how is that not an indication that there is significant interest? This evidence here shows that people have been googling bitcoin less which should be expected in a bear month like this. When it hit 20k many people were googling it, many of thos people are also not investors so this means nothing. 
If you search crypto, you will see much different results.

Don't expect this to continue long term. All you need is 1 bad trade and you're wrecked.

I'm going on a limb and say this story is bullshit. You don't understand trading really. Even if you made the worst trade possible you wouldn't have lost your investment, just cut it by a percentage.
"Lost it trading" = Feel bad for me so you give me money.

This is not going to work and you will most likely end up losing money by mistiming the market.
"Time in the market is better than timing the market" as the saying goes. Everyone gets the idea 'hey, I'll just day trade to make extra profit'. Not worth trying unless you are a professional trader. Just hold that long term.
Also there are higher taxes on short term gains. Every time you sell you will have to record your gain and pay up at tax time.

Selling in a bull market 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:11:21
It's not easy money. There is no guarantee the price will dip again after you pull your 1k 'profit' and you could end up with your only option to buy in at a higher price. Also you are assuming it will keep rising and dip exactly when you want it to. What if the market goes bear and you don't see gains for months?
Many people get this naive idea that they will time the market and squeeze out extra profit. Unless you are a professional (it's your real job) don't go trying to time this thinking you will succeed. You are just as likely to make a bad trade as a good one.
The other thing you arent considering is taxes. Every time you sell you create a taxable event so this will eat into your profits as well as fees you pay when trading/transferring with bitcoin, especially for short term trades.
Go with the old advice: Time in the market is better than timing the market.

I disagree. Electricity is not "destroyed" it is simply transferred from one place to another. Also the way we generate energy is inefficient, it could change to allow for more energy from more sources (solar, wind, hydro etc.) This combined with the world possibly using less electricity everyday in large banks would mean that bitcoin electricity consumption probably won't be as destructive as you think.

I think its more a momentary lapse where the fees are going to be high until the proper solutions are sorted out to allow ease of transactions, and micro payments.
I have a small phone app wallet and tried to send a few dollars to a friend and thought: "This is definitely not for small transactions."
Also in it's current state I would not buy something with a currency I belive could go up 10x in value  So with the HODL mentality the only transactions you make are usually large ones into your wallet.
One day it will be at that point but its still very new. Imagine early phone/internet networks.
Good luck!

No because there will always be someone selling. Not everyone has the HODL mentality and some are trying to profit in the short term.  Many organizations professionally trade it as well so they need to turn a profit. The only way you can make money is by selling/trading it for someone else so even the most diehard hodlers will sell some eventually.
Not only that but the people who use it for quick transfers around the world will quickly convert it in and out of fiat and couldn't care less about the long term price.

A pyramid scheme involves a faux company with a "product" which can be workout supplements, vacation packages, pretty much anything to avoid the obvious. They use the "product" to cover the fact that most of the income is made through recruiting others to join.
You pay money for the ability to sell the "product" except most of the time you are not selling the product itself, but you are selling the right to sell the product to others much like you purchased.
Many include monthly fees, which are taken away of you recruit a number of new "sellers" into the company, say 4. Also they can get their monthly fee removed if they too recruit 4 people under them.
This soon forms "downlines" of people below you who you make commissions off of. The lucky ducks, or early birds, drive around in new cars enticing new people to join the business, and to the average person it seems very easy to make a lot of money in these schemes.
The sad part is many people fall for this because of the psychological manipulation and tricks the company plays on people, who are usually in desperate sitiations. The numbers don't lie, more than 75% of people in these pyramids do not make a single dime while "working" sometimes wasting many months and losing many friends because their life revolves around recruiting people into a doomed-to-fail business model. Sad really.
The reason bitcoin is not even remotely close to this in the slightest is that it HAS NO COMPANY THAT ISSUES IT. It is created through the original coding that ensures nobody can duplicate a bitcoin through cryptographic proof. 
It relies on math and can not be manipulated by a centralized authority. If you buy a bitcoin and the price goes down  You still have a bitcoin. If you forget about it for 20 years and find your wallet key, you still have a bitcoin. The only people who have lost money are those who panic sold when the price dropped and they make emotional decisions.
Points to tell your mom:
-No centralized authority
-Backed by a massive computer network
-Can not be duplicated
-Finite in nature
-investors are taking it seriously, not the case with ponzi/pyramid schemes.

That is why it's not for every day purchase. It's called digital gold for a reason. Right now  a great store of value is it's  use. If you hold in the wallet it's currently in you won't have to worry about fees unless you plan on moving it a lot which doesn't make sense.

Possibilities:

Private keys physically stolen/copied.
Be extremely paranoid with your wallet. Disconnect from the internet when generating private keys, or typing them into a wallet application. Keep a physical copy of the private key written down, then remove the wallet application from your computer. If done properly the only place the keys exist is on your paper backup.

Not even close its just getting started. Go ask 100 people about bitcoin, maybe 10 of them have heard of it. Maybe 1 out of those 10 even owns any.
Now what I would agree with is the days are gone of investing  $100 and becoming a millionaire, but a $10,000 investment could still reach 1mil in the future considering Bitcoin takes on a much larger cap.
Also consider that many people invested early, cashed out for a few thousand, or lost their coins. A small percentage actually held until today.

1 bitcoin is an arbitrary amount since it can be divided so much. 
Think about how much money you are willing to invest. 1k? 5k? 10k? Then do a ton of research and pick a few entry dates. Split the amount into 2 to 3 purchase points so you can minimize volatility. If you want to invest don't wait to make the first purchase, just get your foot in the door.
After you are finished investing for the moment, make a note of the average dollar cost you purchased at. Then forget about FIAT entirely and start thinking of your bitcoin as your wallet balance and not a dollar amount. 
This is to avoid thoughts of "Oh my god I have $10,000 today." Next day. "Oh my god I have $8,700! I'm LOSING money!"
Instead think "I have 2.7638 bitcoin"
The price is not important short term if you belive it has long term upward potential.

After fees and conversion it's not abnormal to pay 20% for some services. Many simply include the fee in the rate so it's difficult to see exactly how much you are being charged.
When reading your post I immediately thought of one of those "Spend X get Y bitcoin" sites. Not that they are bad, but like bitcoin ATMs they have a fixed rate. Upon further research cex.io is a legit exchange but they only allow you to purchase set amounts for a fixed price.
Look up which exchanges operate in your country. Where you can deposit from your bank account and trade for ~0.15%.
At least you have bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:44:47
I would not advise that at all because most countries have laws on false identity and fraud. What you could do is have one of those trusted friends sign up for the exchange and have them buy bitcoin which they could sell to you for cash.
Or use an alternate method to purchase them like local bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-09-22 14:46:53
Dollar is imaginary made up money. Research the *federal reserve* and *fractional reserve banking*. Bitcoin is based on a mathmetically secured universal digital ledger.
What's better is that no government issues it. Your friend might see that as a bad thing but in reality it can not be controlled by a single authority. It is only created by contributing computing power to solving hash functions which process transactions on the blockchain.
Look at the bills in your wallet. How can something be "backed" by an entity that is $19 trillion dollars in debt? 
When you get a loan the money is created from nothing, and it loses value by design. When you buy bitcoin you are buying actual bitcoin from someone whether that be an exchange or someone's personal bitcoin.
If you realize that goverment issued money, since we dropped the gold standard, quite literally is believed to have value simply because we are told it does. It can and has been created to boost the economy, which in turn devalues the money in your pocket. 
Bitcoin and blockchain are freeing to mankind who now can store value easily, without a bank, free from the problems of a central issuing authority. It's great.

No they don't choose the difficulty. Think of the difficulty like a test at school. The teacher (bitcoin code) decides how difficult the test should be based on the ability (hash power) of the students (miners). Only this test has one question(Hash to find), and the first to find the answer wins (seals the block).
If you go into the test with inferior hashpower, you will fail every time. Now imagine that this school (bitcoin network) has been going on for a while, and the test is extremely difficult now. You won't stand a chance trying to compete with the geniuses (industrial mining farms) who have put time and money to be the best. 
The bar is consistently raised higher as time goes on.

Ah, I understand as I was skeptical of exchanges at first. The main danger of exchanges is not them running off with the coins, it's hackers stealing their coins. As long as you do not keep bitcoin there the saftey of the exchange does not effect you. Get verified, deposit fiat, buy bitcoin, move to wallet you own, done.

Anyone who tells you a price movement with certainty is an idiot. Dollar cost average if you want to avoid volatility in both directions. The best way to make the most (and lose the most) is putting all 7k in right now. Shorter investment windows are riskier.
The longer you stretch out the buy orders the less the price movements affect your investment. That goes both ways however, if it skyrockets you miss out on that increase. On the contrary, if it plummets while you are still making preset buy in amounts you will take advantage of that drop.
My personal opinion, and I'm no expert by any means, is to not delay your investment for very long. There's the classic "I'll buy at the dip" skeleton meme. However, definitely don't put in one buy order for 7k, even if you are eager break it up into 2-4 increments over a week or two. I would most certainly have made my full investment before November, if it was me.
The other reason to break up the buy orders is, it's enjoyable to make the purchases when you have a solid plan. You can put in a 1k buy order at a price that is attractive to you, and put in more 1k buy orders in $100 descending increments. If the price pulls back your orders will pop and the falling price will lower your average. Whatever you do, don't buy at an all time high. Think long term also.
The main point is it's YOUR money so do a bunch of research and don't rely on people from reddit. 
I'll leave you with a price prediction. The upcoming event might cause people to buy in to take advantage of a possible fork and possible new coin. OR people may sell out of fear of the impending fork. So there you go, the price might go up, or it might go down.
TL:DR - Shorter investment windows are riskier. DCA reduces the effect of price movements on your investment. Everyone has unique situations, do what is best for you and research plenty.

You have a point, especially in times of large trade volume. They also recieve fees in FIAT as well, who is to say they turn around and sell the fees right away?

Use a physical copy of the keys. A USB stick seems to be a good idea but it can fail. You can also use a safe deposit box at the bank which will be given to next of kin. This way they cant lose it but will still have access to it in the case of your demise.
Edit: Don't just write the keys on a post-it note and deposit. Come up with some way to hide the keys in an item or scramble the code. Tell next of kin about the importance of the item in the box. Always keep multiple backups in a few locations.

Chill out! As others have said this is unhealthy and emotional investing. You shouldn't be trying to cut your losses and buy back in. A lot of people have made the mistake of buying near the all time high only to see it drop and sell in panic. 
The market is manipulated by whales and these dips shake out the "weak" hands. I'm sorry to put it bluntly but you are a weak hand if you've sold at a loss and made minimal amounts back. Also you had a 25% loss? Try a 50-90% loss. Do you have the strength to hold then? The more solid your plan the less you will buckle at the dips.
Stop selling! Buy what you're going to buy and hold on to it. If it hits 10k you will feel silly for trying to time this dip to 3.6k.

Haven't had experience with them but they seem reliable. I ended up with Kraken, but there are many good ones. Spend a few hours reading reviews on the best ones, not many take US bank deposits.
Be prepared for an extensive vetting process, most require an ID, some require proof of residence, pictures of you holding your ID, etc. They are serious about AML regulations, and fraud prevention. Choose one you trust.
Best way to deposit IMO is transfers made from your local bank branch. Places like coinbase will lock your coins for 7 days (at the purchase price luckliy) when using debit cards because bitcoin is immutable, banks are not. Chargebacks can, and do happen.
Good luck.

*grabs popcorn*
My opinion would be to not cash out BTC right now as anyone holding bitcoin will have that same amount in Bcash when the fork occurs. It's not "free money" but you could benefit from this, which is why I believe the BTC price is rising at the moment from people buying in. 
What to do next is up to you. I personally think the "dump Bcash for BTC" mentality will drive the price of Bcash down in the beginning but it may rebound, so I myself am going to wait before selling.
Things to keep in mind:
1) You can be lazy and have the exchange split your BTC, but this could be dangerous.
2) Hold your private keys, after August 1st transfer your BTC to another wallet under your control, then use the old private key to claim Bcash with a Bcash client. 
The private key to your old wallet will have 0 BTC on it, but will have Bcash due to containing a BTC balance on August 1st.
Make sure you do your due diligence, use extreme caution using exchanges, and new "Bcash clients." This is not trading advice, just my opinions.
