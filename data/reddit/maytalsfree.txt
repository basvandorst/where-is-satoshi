And if the key is controlled by a respected third party (if thats how online or third party cryptowallets work). I think the use of smart contracts for properties is far morr complex, since the variable of cotroliing the key still means that the property is recorded under your name and can be viewed by others. Or am i missinformed again :P im just trying to debate a bit in order to learn something new, to build an understanding... No ill intent

Thats good reasoning :) like you answer

I get all of that, but isnt there more potential in other blockchain applications, IoT, voting, education, or are cryptos just the basis for further developments.
Edit: and can't cryptos also be artificialy inflated. They don't just work on supply and demand right?

Correct me if I am wrong, but cryptocurrencies creation transaction and everything encompassing it is recorded on a blockchain. And all of that is done with the use of smart contracts. In the case of bitcoin thats bitcoin script (turing incomplete), and of course a lot of other stuff, while in some others is turing complete languages. Isn't all that the underlying technology. Plus the model of privacy and security like hawk (and others that are based on ZKP and non interactive ZKP)

So what actually determines the value of a cryptocurrency. And if I want to pull funds I still have to get it as a currency, so there is big intrerplay between economics and cryptoeconomics. I guess bitcoin is like money before 1971 and Nixon.

So blockchains are just used for recording stuff being a backup?

I was thinkg about smart contracts. They can't just be used for crypto creation and p2p transfers and everything else revolving around crypto. And in regards to bc and btc i dont think one works without the other. My point was that i don' understand why the main focus is on cryptos and not on other uses of blockchain and smart contracts.

Well I was thinking of blockchains used for particular purposes, i dont know recording who wrote which piece of music, which car has which plates so basic record stuff. I think such chains aren't of the same size and scale as the ones used for financial transactions. Plus if you would use it in a working enviornment eg a company or university it doesnt have to be decentralized on an infinite amount, but shared between, maybe 100-200 points.

Can't I be disinformed :D 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:10:17
Would you be kind and elaborate on that. What am i missing?
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:39:05
And smart contracts? 
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:24:20
Enlighten me. Im here to learn :)
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:23:19
We will see where it goes :). Tnx for the response
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:12:55
Thank you for the response. This helped a lot. Very constructive.

Never thought of it that way. Good argument. But doesn't the problem of blockchain size then arrise, or is that another debate
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:28:47
This looks interesting. Will research more about it.
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:27:37
Correct me if i am wrong, but can't blockchain be created on a smaller scale, like ibm is doing on their new mainframes (for sc application) or am I just disinformed.

In switzerland and i think haiti (not sure about the second one) they are using bc and smart contracts as a eay to write down landowners and buying and selling of land. In haiti in particular since they have problems with corruption and selling of land to multiple buyers. So they plan to prevent that with bc. Crytocurrencies ofc. And IBM started producing mainframes that work using smartcontracts. They kind of build their own chain using docker and some other stuff. They plan on using it to track manufacturing parts that are to be used in further production + a lot of other stuff like payments, logistics etc.
