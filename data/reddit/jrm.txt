meet at a public place. allot of people meet at coffee shop, mcdonalds, even the parking lots of banks sometimes. That way theres witnesses. Make sure you have bitcoin before you give him the cash or atleast have them in your BTC wallet before your done.

I do agree there are some stuff i disagree about alex jones most of his stuff is overpriced and sometimes he doesnt let people talk and get tot there point, like when he was debating david duke. but i said his name because allot of the stuff he says is true and does happen he has even mentioned bitcoin in past videos but ill look up luke thanks.

yes about anyone who post on this thread will be pm'd about ethereum, they want people to buy into ethereum in hopes the price will double triple and sell make a few bucks.

Thanks for all the replies the only reason i ask is allot of people including me are anticipating a big year for bitcoin and have allot of money invested in it. But with everything going on right now in the world i think something big is about to happen and hopefully bitcoin will rise through it all. Theres a guy named Alex Jones he is the host of InfoWars they talk about everything in the world going on how corrupt the government is and things like that, now allot of people call him crazy and a conspiracy theorist but almost everything he says happens. If you guys have a min go watch him, He doesn't talk about bitcoin but potentially things that could effect bitcoin.

Fuck out here with your ethereum shit you just want people to buy so you can make fast cash.

to my understanding circle you can only sell $300 a week unless your account is built up and alloud $3000. so circle might not be your best bet. Coinbase is i believe $10000 so that should easily cover that. It will take a couple days for it to show up in your bank account though.

The main reason i say global collapse is because believe it or not the world leaders want a one world government. I may sound crazy but theres actually people that have came out and said that. If that happens it will be worse then the great depression.

Im not talking about a doing a gambling site maybe just a site literally called something like bitcoin lottery. lets you buy tickets at lets say 2 bucks in bitcoin every friday they draw the winners. winners get like 90% of the profit the rest goes to the website.
In my opinion it wouldnt be hard to put together but it would only work if it had a good amount of supporters.

Putting all your money in Bitcoin would be stupid only put what your willing to loose. Same goes with gold, silver while there prices will probably go up you don't want to loose it all.
