WE'RE WEALTHY INVESTORS, i guess.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:02:13
Exactly; and these people are teaching others to be *just as stupid*.
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:25:58
Definitely for *receiving payments*.  For getting some fiat though from those bitcoin is what I mean.
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:04:55
If everyone did what you did, it would be immensely helpful.  You are helping.
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:27:52
No.  You choose to read them.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:15:01
Yep, same here.  That's why "wealthy investors" threw me off.

Plato was a student of Socrates.  Aristotle was a student of Plato.  Dumbass.

Watch out, 
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:39:27
Gotcha.  *Fiat* is the difference here.
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:36:14
It isn't, but isn't it the *exact same* system where people can borrow with funds they don't own, or am I missing something?
What's to stop the Chinese from using Polo?

SHHHH, no one's supposed to know.
@_date: 2017-01-05 09:16:02
I mean top 1% of bitcoin owners.  Only 100 people could own 210,000 and I think there are millions of bitcoin owners.

What a crash!  ¥7700 now and falling.

How many bitcoins would it take to become a one-percenter?  100?

Excellent answer; thanks.

[Isn't Polo doing the same thing?  What stops the Chinese from using them?](
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:22:15
Good for you.  I have had an issue.  I'm warning other users that it's not 99.9999% safe like some writers have said.  If you haven't had an issue, great.  But other people may want a warning and this is a warning.
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:49:14
¥7000 now.
You were saying?

Should limit rapid rises to make the market more balanced.
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:20:47
Nope, not FUD.  This isn't on bitcoin at all, this is on *Poloniex*.  Bitcoin is strong.  I'm trying to prevent people from losing like I did.  I read all kinds of sites saying it was 99.9999% safe.  Well a 0.19 bitcoin loess on 1 bitcoin isn't 99.9999% safe.
Again, NO FUD.  Bitcoin is strong.

Is everything above Satoshi:0.13.1 SegWit?  That looks like about 44% adoption if so (Satoshi:0.13.1 and Satoshi:0.13.2).
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:51:15
I have most funds on paper.  However, I wanted to use GDAX to place a limit sell.
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:23:42
Yes, I have outstanding loans and some pending (that I cancelled due to losses), but the total amount of all pending, outstanding and cancelled (overall lending balance) is 0.81 bitcoins.
I started with 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-19 12:29:35
Yep, will update.
You've been warned.

We can't make this shit up if we tried!
@_date: 2016-12-02 12:43:56
This is a lie.
If you transfer bitcoins to another exchange to trade, that is not a sale, unless you swap to another currency immediately.
Troll site; ignore.
Coinbase is reporting the purchase point and the amount transferred out.  It's up to us to report whether the "transfer out" was to buy an item (sell of bitcoin) or to move to a different wallet.  If I bought items, then the transfer out is a sell and I need to report that; if I moved money to a Trezor wallet, I need to simply state that to the IRS, like:
BTC 3.0   In     Bitcoin purchase;
BTC 1.5   Out   Purchased Hardware;
BTC 1.0   Out   Transfer to Trezor;
In this example, I would need to report the cost basis of the buy-sell of the 1.5 BTC since I used it for a purchase.
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:31:31
When I hear back from Polo; yes.  
I have cancelled all pending offers and turned off auto-renew on the current ones.  I want to first stop everything, hear their response, then I'll go from there.
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:19:57
2017 my friend.  2017.

Keynesian economists *despise* bitcoin because they hate monetary freedom.
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:37:29
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:22:28
So, a hacker could compromise the address on the Trezor/Ledger screen, or just the address on the browser screen?
In theory, shouldn't I be able to write down the BTC address from the Trezor/Ledger, then log into an exchange, and do the transfer (assuming I enter the address right)?
@_date: 2016-12-02 13:47:34
No, they don't.  You're lying.  If you transfer out of the account to a wallet, other exchange, etc, it is not a sale.  You are a fucking liar if you think otherwise; read the IRS on it.  They do not treat it as a sale at all.
@_date: 2016-12-31 21:26:56
So scary and true.  No one really cares what money is until it stops working.  Then everyone cares.  By then, it's too late.

What's the underlying currency the shares sell in?  Dollars, bitcoin?  Anyone know?
@_date: 2016-12-07 18:55:19
So you were right.  Interesting.
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:55:18
I get that you can create an account offline, and then you can send bitcoins to that address.  However, how can you pull up an offline account that has *NEVER* touched the network and send bitcoins away from that address.  If it never touches the network to verify that the user did send the transaction (private key), I don't see how that can happen.
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2016-12-19 09:33:47
That's why I'm not answering their questions, lol.  They can do their own due diligence!
@_date: 2016-12-07 18:38:06
In other words, it doesn't exist! LMAO.
Nice try on the FUD.
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:09:03
I couldn't find it.  Again, where is the link to this?  Sounds like you're throwing out an assertion without evidence.  Love to see it!

Yep.  still in the shock phase tho
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:56:49


Thanks for this; so it sounds like a hardware wallet that displays the wallet on its screen cannot be compromised, while the wallet address on the browser could be hacked/spoofed by a hacker.  For these wallets, though, one could make sure that the physical wallet address and the browser address match.
@_date: 2016-12-10 22:08:08


LMAO!  Somewhere in the world Karl Marx is saying *oh shit, didn't think of that* in his grave, lol.
