My friends are kicking themselves in the ass rn for selling back in 2014

1. I initially invested because I had intended on using the crypto currency for darknet transactions (something I never followed through with), but also because of the potential it had when I bought some in 2016.
2. I’m not deep in the knowledge of bitcoin enough to speculate properly but one thing I feel is an impending issue is the independence of it and government sanctions being placed on it in the future. I feel like many governments worldwide are making efforts to limit the invisibility and “darkness” of it in turn limiting casual investors. I feel like the entire culture of it so to speak has changed a lot in the less than two years I’ve spent involved and I just feel as if it’s a lot more controlled now. I don’t really know how this can be fixed just given the representation of bitcoin in the media and how it is no longer an underground industry rather now a recognizable currency and household topic. I mean shit, the vape store in my small town is seeking coins and accepting them as payment.
3. I honestly have no idea what the price may be in 5-10 years. I do have a lot of faith and hope for the growth of bitcoin so I could see it easily being at 20,000 again and staying around there comfortably, but the unpredictability of bitcoin could leave it as low as it was in 2014 again. Who knows?
4. Realistically, cryptocurrency could never, and shouldn’t, replace physical currency just because of how intricate and complex the system is, I can’t see the entire country using crypto as currency. And it’s so new compared to the monetary system we’ve had established for centuries, I don’t think it will transcend to that level. I do feel that it will become more prevalent as you see more stores and websites accepting bitcoin as payment, some European countries even having bitcoin atms so I do believe it will become more prevalent in everyday life but not as a complete replacement.
