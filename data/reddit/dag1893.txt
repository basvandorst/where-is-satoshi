Agreed! Despite the craziness, I'm still a believer and will continue to offer my dating services for Bitcoin.
Can I ask what you were searching for?

Thanks for sharing! This is my blog. Yes, I'm a big believer in Bitcoin and I'm excited to do my part in promoting it. I imagine my blog audience isn't the typical Bitcoin enthusiast, haha. I'm currently working on a system to offer phone coaching sessions, and of course I'll accept Bitcoin for those as well.

That makes a car dealership in Dallas and a real estate company in Houston. Texas is on its way!

I can't comment on how useful/effective that machine is, but I'm sure it would be a huge improvement from a basic mac.

I love this so much.

Mac user here. From what I've read - getting into mining would not be a good use of your time. Most miners have very powerful machines that allow them to get a reasonable rate of return on their machine's work. Mining would simply use up all of your mac's computing power and would take a VERY long time before you see any profit.

That's the dream!
