To be pedantic, you have missed something. Just not everything.

Maybe he is tempting the gods because he has a lot of dry powder ready for a big buy

This is so cliche... But saving for future reference.

Just did. From my (very brief) reading I suspect a imminent drop, but this buy is more symbolic. It's just $100. And I vow to drop $1000 of it goes below 7k in the next few months. But the point being I am sold, this is legit. 
This is how skeptics turn long termers. It all begins with one purchase. Plus some dude tipped me basically nothing on reddit years ago, now it's worth $17! Sweat it was $0.25 when they did it

I'm not trying to be offensive but I don't believe you. This being the internet, anyone can say they are anything, so trying to make a point based on your sexual orientation or really any other unverifiable item is pointless, and it's anecodtal if true anyway. I just look at what he says, and what the logical implications are.

If you can't get the point you are being obtuse.

Problem I see in the long run is it is still traceable. But being censor proof is huge and shouldn't be discounted

This one always cracked me up. I kinda get why Democrats say it (climate change denial), but is there some specific topic or anything that got Republicans to say this to Democrats? Seems like Democrats have a reputation for too literally filling facts or proof rather than religion, self reliance, or tradition.  Or is this just an attempt to over use a phrase so much it loses meaning?
