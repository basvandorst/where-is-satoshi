after hitting 1000 usd you will say it was few years ago 1000 usd and everyone was celebrating
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:19:32
I dont believe. I sold my bitcoins at 19.900 . I am here to make profit. I will buy when it will be profitable again.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:15:12
I sold my btc at 19k. I will buy again if I see lighning network working
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:57:17
you transfer it when you eventually want to cashout. thats all...
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:47:25
bitcoin is for storing value. dont transfer it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:51:16
I go there sometimes to hear news abbout bcash but only thing I see is btc ded, btc high fee, btc no future. they are right sometimes but we are here to make profit. bcash may have better tech or something but I am not using cryptos as payment I use them to make short-long term profit. why would I use bcash while it drops day by day. if I want to use a payment option there is ethereum also.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:15:55
I sold half of my btc at 19.900 and never buy until fees are fixed. I still hold half of it in case some miracle happens... I don't know.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:31:16
you guys buy 50k$ worth btc and you sell it tomorrow for 52k$ and buy a car then say "I bought a car thanks to btc!"
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:05:19
if you waited 1 more month you would buy 2 houses
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:52:11
rip your money. happy new year
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:14:59
I bought other alt coins at the dip and doubled my money already. I dont stick to one coin like hodlers do :) people here may downvote me but when btc was 19k I also bought some bcrash by selling some btc and bcrash also doubled after I bought. I am here to make profit not just hodl or sell high buy dip. I jump from coin to coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:13
it shows false info it seems. try to refresh page.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:16:39

@_date: 2017-11-15 13:06:15
I sold my btc at 5600 :( r/btc told me btc will drop much more.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:32:41
looks like people are buying bcash with bitcoin. but why? I try to ask this question but my messages keep removed by mods.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:14:32
I am scared :( I sell all my bitcoins from 7800$ pls buy
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:23:07
   I simply asked is that the reason and if its why. and my post removed.  if you check this link you will see half of the posts are removed before anyone else sees. reason is title includes bcash, bitcoin cash, bch.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:03:16

@_date: 2017-11-29 11:37:22
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:19:29
I panicked there and sold all my btc too :D and bought back at 4800 again. after I bought it dropped to 2900 thanks to china. I buy at ATH sell at dip. that's how I work. I still make profit tho
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:14:38
haha nope :D I meant US dollar, not AUD. I am from Turkey. but it is $6800 now here :S
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:17:09

@_date: 2017-11-21 16:27:43

@_date: 2017-11-26 20:08:24

@_date: 2017-11-11 15:01:08

@_date: 2017-11-13 21:08:07
I sold my btc when btc hit 5600 yesterday, was thinking it will go to 5000. it bounced back to 6000+ after 5600. How am I succeeding everytime selling dip...
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:23:40
I dont want to ruin bitcoin by buying now :D its going well. I dont want to stop it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:53:01
You mean today?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:22:35
go to r/btc and say "bcash is dead buy btc".
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:45:05
It's nonsense using bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:40:07
so nobody knows why people buy bcash by selling bitcoin and other altcoins. everybody do this but they have no idea why they are doing. okay cool.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:38:37
that's why we dont trust bitcoin and split our savings :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:50:19
Should I buy bitcoin cash? is it too late?
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:49:20
wait for fork. there maybe a dip
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:41:16
Down to 4000 :(
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:15:04
it's not the best. its only most popular. I still dont trust bitcoin. btc will gain my trust again if fee becomes lower than 5$. My savings are 60/40 btc/eth
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:35:56
P A S H A
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:25:46
Because there is an alternative this time. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:07:42
I am not selling my bitcoins dont freak out. I am just asking if I should buy bitcoin cash right now?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:13:03
what is normal? $5 ? I hope it's lower than that.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:01:01
you already made profit
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:04:48
I was checking gdax. after 8600$ dip, it went up to 10500$ and dropped again. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:09:57
I sold half of my bitcoins at 5600
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:09:19
I watched graph it dropped from 7800 to 5600 so I couldnt watch it drop anymore and sold half of my btc. as soon as I sold, it bounced back to 6000 and kept going to 7000+ :( 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:00
dropped again to 9600 :sigh:
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:37:06
from now on we should post every 5k rise. because 1k is so small now.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:10:57
but it worked. bitcoin price increasing now
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:19:06
I dont think we will see 7800 again for looong time :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:23:32
I dont remember sorry :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:39
btc 11k again :D edit: almost hit 11k but dropped again
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:58:24
is bitcoin dead :(
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:34:54
it hit to 7900 for a moment at gdax
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:26:04
use exchanges where you live. you will already pay much more while searching and wasting time. so it doesnt matter how cheap you buy. biggest discount was yesterday and 1 btc was 5600 dollar.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:56:15

@_date: 2017-09-14 22:51:56
I bought 700 dollar worth btc when btc was 4300$ :(
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:57:23
RemindMe! 5 seconds
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:44:55
I was planning to buy bitcoin since it was $700 and I bought some and sold at first ATH then never bought until $4800 again. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:15:18
thanksx you
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:51:10

@_date: 2017-10-29 20:10:49
what is ATH?
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:38:24
so if I want to buy something small with btc I will pay 0.00000000000000000001 btc
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:47:21
I bought at 6150
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:52:39
my strategy is if I have money I buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:18:30
dropped to 6100 :(
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:06:28
so should I sell my bitcoins? or buy more when dip?
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:23:16
I actually first time laughed at a shit post on r/bitcoin
