In some scenarios the woman is the responsible one. You might get a guy who buys a lot of toys and racks up credit card debt, wife didn't realize she was getting someone irresponsible, he should not buy crypto.   
  
Depends on the situation. In my marriage I'm the responsible one with $$ so I can just buy crypto or whatever else investments without having to tell her about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:25:23
Um, then you definitely tell her...

If anything it will go up when all coins are mined

Maybe start with $50 to see how it works and get used to the technology. Then you'll feel better about putting $1,000 in.

Probably has not exceeded the significance of Credit Cards.

Lucky bastard. I tried doing that today and they shut down my account with money in it.
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:24:44
Why are so many bitcoin addresses holding less than a transaction charge worth of bc? 
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:54:13
Is there a better way to acquire? Or is it just a big shitshow and your lucky if you don't get screwed over?
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:16:14
That's how people who buy and sell the same product make money.
@_date: 2016-06-19 16:45:35
Is this a spam post? I had just initiated my first attempt to buy bitcoin from coinbase last week. The money hasn't come out of my bank yet so this is freaking me out and making me want to freeze my bank account until my coinbase trx fails. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:32:32
I don't see why I would be. I don't do shady things
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:33:53
Signed up sunday. Bought bc twice. Seemed fine. I tried to buy more this morning and they locked my account. The amounts were around $100 each time, all on a debit card.
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:37:26
I'm going to try going through Kraken with my other checking account/debit card
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:43:09
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:18:12
trying to figure that out. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:54:16
11% charge fees though.
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:44:39
Does Kraken have a wallet or something or do you bc just sit in an account?
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:42:15
They didn't require an ID.
@_date: 2016-06-24 00:40:49
I'm glad at least one person agrees. Makes me feel less crazy.
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:38:31
I don't expect circle or coinbase to resolve anything. Sounds like they just think I'm doing something shady. If I were doing something shady I wouldn't be here complaining, because I would know why.
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:56:39
I've never had trouble with banks. Why would I be blacklisted?. I was also very respectful in my communications with circle. Finally, I don't see why my accounts would look like suspicious money. All I do is get my paycheck deposited into my bank account and pay bills. If I was doing shady things, I would know I was blacklisted and wouldn't be on here complaining right? I'm going to try Kraken with a different checking account... See if it was my personal id or my account that was the issue. I've just never dealt with companies like this before. Bitcoin is going nowhere unless these companies customer handling can get as good as banks. I could open 5 new checking accounts and 3 new credit cards today if I wanted and none of the fiat institutions would bat an eye. This is probably mostly to do with me being a dog person and apparently bc is for cat people.

The ATMs cost way more? Yeah looks like it my local one says 11% buy fee?
@_date: 2016-06-24 00:05:00
So when bit coins are in an account like that are there actual bitcoins there with my "name" on them? Or is it like a banker where the number in your account is just backed by reserves?
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:18:05
Just like a retailer. Meijer might buy snickers bars for .25 apiece then sell them for .75 apiece. Call it a markup, spread, whatever. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 22:56:01
Bitcoin is high risk but ironically it's almost high risk not to. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:17:50
Yeah that would be tough I work a salaried job. I would have thought it would be easy to acquire.
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:44:42
All real info. Didn't send any bitcoin. My Debit card did flag today. I had to call my bank and tell them to let the purchase through. They did, and I tried one more debit card purchase in Circle and it didn't flag my card but minutes later the lock happened. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 00:01:57
Seriously? I'm so baffled by this whole situation. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:19:15
Deposit $, withdrawal BC? Is it like the others where you put a bank account and debit card on there then they have to but BC with it? 
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:37:21
Localbitcoins, you can sell above market price. Coinbase/circle are shady for some people. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 13:37:06
It would never happen. Holders would start selling long before a Satoshi could buy an island. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:43:53
If that were the case I wouldn't be stupified as to what the problem is? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:43:03
I cannot access my account. They said they are deleting my account. They also won't give a reason why. I called customer service and the person literally knew nothing more than what I knew (read the email back to me, told me my account was shut down). 
"We have carefully reviewed the information you provided us and unfortunately we will not be able to offer you service. We made this decision in order to comply with federal regulations and protect our customers from fraud.
We cannot go into specific details about what led us to our decision. Thank you for understanding."

Is Coinbase safe? There are people on here acting like its a totally fine place to do exchanges. There are others saying they are basically going under as we speak (link below). Is that just normal spam that you here all the time?

Transfer your Bitcoin out, then restore to coinomi. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:46:22
No it didn't.
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:20:10
I would have to use coinbase wallet to buy my trezor (only purchaseable in bc), leaving them on coinbase for a few days until it arrives...is that a major risk or do you think I'd be ok?   
@_date: 2017-01-08 13:35:00
Depends what your IQ is.

When you can use bitcoin wherever you want to shop, and make it easier to use, and start giving women bitcoin, they will use it as much as credit cards.

You mean a brockchain?

How do you verify someone didn't give you bullshit bitcoins then? Nothing like that is in place.
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:20:29
They are shit. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 03:58:55
Circle has the right to not tell you why they locked your account, and they won't tell me why they locked mine. They changed my btc into USD without my permission and then told me to move the usd out of my circle account. They have no clue what they are doing, and have shitty, incompetent service. Unless your one of the lucky 50% of people who continue to claim circle is fine.
@_date: 2016-07-05 00:30:49
I have nothing to hide and Coinbase froze my account and won't explain what's going on. It's not because you don't have anything to hide, your just one of the lucky people who they don't f*ck up your account. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 06:40:28
Liberals don't use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-10 03:44:55
Once the volatility becomes comparable to the usd's current volatility, you'll see more of this. If I part 155 bits for a new bicycle today, then 75 bits for a new bicycle in August, I might think I'm getting a good deal but maybe the purchasing power has just changed.
@_date: 2016-07-09 02:03:52
Circle can convert your "BTC" to USD without permission and make you transfer it back to your usd bank account. They did it to me. You shouldn't store anything with them long term, they aren't trustworthy. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 04:01:23
More like $0 or $10,000
@_date: 2016-07-07 12:26:25
Consumer adoption matters...if it bitcoin never makes it as a widely accepted currency it has a limited intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:10:42
You need it spelled out more. Gold has value for holding because it has intrinsic value as a physical substance. So everyone the world could hold and the price might go up. If everyone holds bitcoin, it has no function, and the price would drop. Miners would quit if there are no trx to verify. You don't want everyone to hold.
@_date: 2016-07-05 23:00:11
Circle is the same.
@_date: 2016-07-12 22:32:52
Ah... This is the answer I was looking for!
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:07:10
Stocks are discrete units and you can are the different buckets of stock from each time you bought. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:46:34
Can't make teeth out of bitcoin
@_date: 2016-07-07 12:27:44
If the market cap goes so low that bitcoins are $1 again, then bitcoin will be over and go to $0. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:18:47
They are worse than a bank.
@_date: 2016-07-11 16:12:38
I thought it was miners who wouldn't be able to keep up with large blocks that were opposed. They are directly affected. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:20:44
Trading as a commodity helps it because traders end up learning about it well others wouldn't. In fact, just by trading it, they've learned how to use it as currency. People who are more likely to invest future BTC technology might initially be attracted to it as an investment.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:43:36
Before this happens, the global limit of 7 trx per second needs to be addressed. Once the scaling problem is solved, then the evangelization should happen. If all retailers switched now, bitcoin would be fucked anyway. IMO the best way is to get your friend and family to download them a wallet and send them a small about of BTC so they have the basics of the technology. And explain to them the awesomeness of bitcoin to whatever extent they are capable of understanding.
@_date: 2016-07-11 16:11:48
Wasnt the halving mainly just hype on this subreddit and some other forums? Your assumption is that this is entirely trading on halving news. And also that there can only be one pump each year? 
@_date: 2016-07-10 12:17:21
You are the most interesting person I've seen on Reddit. I read this entire thread.
@_date: 2016-07-05 14:45:39
Right...I know how bitcoin transactions take place. I was moreso interested in how you were able to work it out for groceries because I don't know of any grocery stores that take bitcoin as a norm. It sounds like you had to approach the owner and make a deal with him to accept bitcoin? Was he already savvy to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:40:27
That very small window where Fiat has crashed but the power grid and the internet are still up and you haven't been murdered yet.

@_date: 2016-07-05 05:07:17
How do you buy groceries with bitcoin
@_date: 2016-07-12 22:33:50
Well available as an investment. Not as a currency.
@_date: 2016-07-10 17:13:55
It's that you have a vision and are implementing something epic on a large scale and from the sound of it making money too. It's also an idea that every aspect of is in touch with future needs. Sustainable energy and more efficient food production. I have a bunch of small children and a full time job and not a lot of excess capital, so I can't really take a risk and try to execute a vision like that. But I've always wanted solar and farming, but more so just to feed my family and be off grid when the shit hits the fan. And yeah, irl you seem like someone I could talk to for hours. Anyway, very inspiring stuff, at least to me. Don't sweat the downvoters, there's a lot of negative nancies on reddit, and inspiring one person is worth a million downvotes.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:40:30
If you just want to use a debit card for smaller amounts circle might work. However as soon as you trade get your coins off the exchange and to a private wallet. Local bitcoins is more expensive but more trustworthy than either coinbase or circle. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 08:32:23
Maybe a smidge better but not really. They also disabled my account and won't explain anything.

So every time the bags tighten on the graph the price goes up. Why does this particular instance indicate it moving down?
