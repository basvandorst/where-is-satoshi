I hope you lost a lot of coin. You're a jackass! What did you prove or set out to do by saying that? DO you run into the middle of the bank and yell " Everyone down this is a robbery" and expect the tellers to be helpful and not call the cops? People like you damage the community.... FUCKING IDIOT!

Totally agree which is why I asked why he was a moron because he was basically saying and did say, non of your regulations would have done anything against the loss at Gox.

I am starting to think mining is really for those who are willing to keep up with the Hardware race and willing to drop serious loot into their systems (at the current point). A 2.5GH/s or a 5g/h ASIC isn't going to get you anywhere even if you get a bunch how do you compete with people who hash @ ~30,000+ GH/s? I would have to spend a lot (well a lot to a poor guy like me) to grab a 100GH/s rig and it still doesn't seem like it would make a dent in producing a return on investment. With prices crashing it's making it less and less attractive leaving it to a certain few :/ so I think you raise a great question.

That is a ridiculous hypothesis! If that were the case people would be at knife point all day everyday and we would all bitch on how we were just held up and how this is a shitty technology.... I think your being overly dramatic / simplistic in your viewpoint.

But that is what you commented on. Not the message but way it was delivered. Which was very benign.

I should have said one of the beneficial features, not the purpose. Forgive me. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:38:25
Also with the blockchain growing as big as it has and will that will push more and more individuals out again leaving it to the big guys who have the resources others don't.

I'm sorry but I think that is incorrect, I have never gotten the sentiment that the community wanted "Wall Street" as part of bitcoin. I thought that was the purpose was to get away from all the greedy, fraudulent activity that happens on Wall Street. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:16:45
And that is a good thing? Like it or not Gox was good in a lot of ways for Bitcoin and it failing was proof of the strength of BTC.
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:45:07
So basically he didn't make you feel warm and fuzzy? OK.... I would disagree that there was even an encounter worth talking about and found it to be a rather benign conversation that posed a good question to the validity of Regulation. That's just me though. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:41:11
Exactly! Lots to be learned from GOX.

So why did you have your paper wallet on you? lol Seems a huge hole in your overall Bitcoin strategy and security model.

To say that the protocol can never be regulated is true but at the same time a smoke and mirror act. Look at all the panic that happened when PBOC rumored to not allow BTC, or when the IRS was going to make "Regulations" for BTC or when it was speculated that ISPs were conspiring to block the protocol at the parent level. I think there are plenty of ways for "outsiders" to wreck the system, maybe not kill it but take an arm or a leg. Yes it would be nice for widespread adoption but you let a little regulation in by GOV and a whole lot more will follow. 
I am not saying "No! Fuck Wall Street" but in no way will I just open my arms to the same institutions that brought us the reason why we all want to go to BTC in the first place. 
To me I see it like trading GLD and SLV ETFs rather than buying real GLD or SLV and I have issue with that when it comes to opening this up to the dogs of Wall Street.

Did you watch something different? His point is that Regulation doesn't stop piss poor management. As cryptotraveler commented, "Regulation doesnt work, all these regs on the books and still we have things like Enron, Lehman, AIG, Madoff, HSBC laundering money for drug cartels, and secret bailouts by the FEDS. "
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:08:07
Why is he a moron? He has a valid point by asking what those "Regulations" would have done to prevent GOX from doing what it did.... Very valid question.

60 G/h isn't much with today's difficulty. If you could some how couple the 60 G/h rate without adding a farm of Raspberry's then maybe as others said if price is right. With the AntminerS1 rigs being the price they are then anything less is almost pointless since there is no "Real" payout with 60 G/h and that gets less and less as each day goes by.

I agree a new HD is cheap, ASIC Hardware isn't if you really want to compete so then it becomes would you rather do some blow off a hooker and see where the night goes or J/O on or around your new ASIC hardware. If I could have both I would be SOOO happy! lol  
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:02:37
The question was rhetorical. Regulations wouldn't have prevented the loss.

Don't ask..... your young and have tons of "Time" to make that 2.5k back if it didn't work out, plus it sounds like your being smart about it and takin a portion of what is sitting around and doing something with it that could yield a return.... no different than stocks in a way... Ask him if he has stock investments and you instantly have him..
