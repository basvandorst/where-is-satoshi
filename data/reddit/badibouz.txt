The million dollar question being, do we really need such power to just run a currency ?..
Green cryptocurrencies have a great future !

So you imply that there is no link whatsoever between the capacity of the network to handle a certain number of transactions, and the number of participants in the network ?

When ppl with an agenda troll about tether and other ppl with another agenda come up to defend tether, you know it's time to buy a submarine and hide under the ocean for the next few years and wait till the nuclear war is over.

I agree with the benefits you mention. However I believe that CPU-intensive cryptocurrencies with PoW have a major problem, the power shifts to the biggest miners who end up playing a role which is very similar to that of a central bank. The majority of CPU power of bitcoin is in the hands of a small number of miners. Common people cannot afford to mine anymore. If it isn't profitable to mine for the vast majority of people, then your currency is at risk. Right now several countries are adjusting their energy regulations so as either to attract or to discourage miners. That is a huge geopolitical shift of power. What will happen if the Chinese government cracks down on miners ? It will cripple the network. And then you have a similar situation to what is happening in Venezuela.

That's strong arguments. Sounds 100% legit.

Hum I learned something today... thanks !!

There is a lot of research going on around low energy cryptography, whether it be encryption or hashing functions. While you are right today, tomorrow you will be wrong, and we could have both security and low energy. Many crypto standards for low CPU devices (IoT being the main use case) have been normalized for the past few years. Revolutionary algorithms such as homomorphic encryptions were once considered too heavy but now are almost ready for low energy &amp; low CPU use cases. So yes I believe that the first green cryptocurrency with a rich feature set will be a winner.

My personal opinion : don't rely on opinions of others regarding crypto. Do your own research. It's the Wild West here, there are no rules whatsoever, and no way to predict whether a strategy is safe or risky.

Sure. Let's stick to your flawed statement that I just rebuffed.

Yes. Earth is very young also.

Microsoft has a long history of being wrong in its assessment of groundbreaking tech.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:07:29
.Net is an attempt at copying J2EE while removing some of its burdens, like mandatory exception handling and refactoring the class hierarchy. That's incremental innovation, not invention.
The concepts behind all that you mention (permissions file systems, dynamic libraries) :
1) aren't breakthroughs, only small technical details that end users don't care about
2) were previously invented by others (on systems like UNIX, Mac, and others even older).
Innovation is NOT invention. Even the concept of Windows was not invented by them. Even DOS was stolen from its inventor.

When Microsoft says "let's go north", I hear "maybe south is the right way to go".

Building a successful product has nothing to do with inventing something. Please name one tech breakthrough in Windows (a real breakthrough, not a detail) that they really invented.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:06:07
With Microsoft however, copying / killing / swallowing inventions cannot just be compared to what other companies do ; for them, it's at the heart of their corporate culture.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:56:36
Remember when Microsoft looked at the internet and said it had no future.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:16:29
Not 10 years. For their whole history actually they did not invent anything. Quite the contrary. They tried to kill other inventions.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:52:30
Wow. So much emotion. I'm flattered I'm doing so much to you.
Microsoft initially discarded the internet as being a revolution. Then they u-turned and swallowed other innovators with big money. Same with Java : denial first, plagiarism later. Same with cloud computing. Etc, etc, ...
They'll do the same with blockchains and this specific issue of how to scale. Deny first, change their mind later when on-chain scaling solutions prove to be better. My point is that at this stage we can't place much trust in their judgement as they proved to be wrong about many other groundbreaking tech.

Looking at their R&amp;D DNA, they were very successful in following very fast the true inventors, by copying / stealing / buying ideas and competitors and taking credit for things they did not invent, and very unsuccessful in actually inventing new stuff. I can't remember one true breakthrough that was brought by Microsoft in the last 40 years.
