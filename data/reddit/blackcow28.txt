Smarties see my post and leave to check out.

I don’t think so.. I think it will have negatively doubled in value. CBOE coming tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:18:13
Wth.. I wanted to use this for margin trading and now I missed all this timing. Why would we even bother using bitcoins over bitcrash? Whats the benefit of using this btrash over bitcrash?

Ok.. an audit without auditing. We can’t call this an audit. A better and more transparent audit is needed. Can’t vouch the bank account to tether? Uh oh.. that just means sufficient and appropriate audit procedures were not taken to obtain reasonable assurance about the matter. 
This is like.. show you a bank statement with a million dollars, but can’t give you proof that this is mine. WTH? How would you tell whether it is really mine? 
I myself is an auditor of a big four.

Good! And also you shouldn’t use USDT. Once a bank run kind of thing happens to this crypto world, you wouldn’t be able to cash out. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:02:58
Will it go through within a day or two? :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:50:27
Thank you for your reply. I hope you get better over time..

I don’t know how blocks work.. how long would that be? :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:51:50
It says submissions are over limit :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:57:19
Did it request a tx fee??
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:18:10
Well yeah, I knew everything was fishy back then too. Market corrections were imminent back then. You did see it went down to 8900.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:47:20

This comment clearly shows the crypto market is so irrational and immature. Fight back with a valid point. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:38:49
That would be greattt ;(
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:14:08
I see. I sent it from an exchange to an exchange so I don’t think it can do that. I guess I should wait another day until the coins go back then :(
By dropping my transaction, you mean my coins will go back to where it belonged to, right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:02:17
So mine is lower than the lowest ... will it ever go through... i need to sell..
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:38:44
I, too are in a serious depression, although my case was a bit different.. Greed of Wu Jihan plummented the btc price down to 5200 from 7800 back in early november, and all my btc got liquidated. Although I had debt of $80,000 from my bank, I thought I could earn more from bitcoins so I waited out instead of paying back my debt using bitcoins. Now I regret so much and keep blaming myself for the greed I had with the margin trading. I hate to see the btc price going up, and so depressed that I can barely work at work. 
I might be like your brother soon, or not.. 
Losing everything when it’s almost time for marriage for my age group really sucks and deprives me of hope... 
I hate to see bitcoin news articles everywhere and try to avoid anything related to crypto on mass media. 
Investment can lead to suicide. 
People should realize a material amount of investment can devastate their life so therefore omly invest what you can afford to lose.....
Well I had this thought at the beginning, but it faded out. Keep this in mind... only invest what you can afford to lose...

Tether ponzi will end this crypto world. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:58:46
I strongly agree with you. However whenever I mention there will be a correction, people just deny what could come and just say get out of here. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:34:42
I’d like to know how bitcoin can be a ponzi scheme. Please explain excuse my stupidity
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:45:43
It doesn’t matter how much you start with, because our profit from the arbitrage would always be as a percentage. Transfer would be everyday once the bank opens in the morning. What is a bitcoin hub?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:40:26
I’m also concerned about this. I think this price surge for the last few days is from Bifinex. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:46:32
No.. I’m not a scammer. I can provide my identity and a real time video call showing my workplace and my identity and my business card. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:05:31
During market correction, the website is down. so you can’t sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:24:42
First bitfinex followed by Bithumb 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:34:48
I don’t think people keep coins on every exchange. They stick to one. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:46:56
10% swings are not a few percentages
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:40:58
Well it most likely will.

Japanese, CME, and the other I don’t know. However as you already know CME controls the futures market. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:29:50
We can do a wire transfer through bank. If there is other methods you can recommend, I’ll also look into it!
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:45:55
Its called cash settled futures. Many markets have this.
