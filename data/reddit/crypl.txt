VISA isn't shutting 'crypto cards' down, they're shutting WaveCrest down. All these card companies will recover eventually when they find new issuers. Yes, i'll save you the trouble of checking my post history, I am holding MCO, but i'm calling you out on your general crypto fud. We all need healthy competition in this market.

Yes it does sound ridiculous to me but not for the reasons you share

I was one of those in yesterday's post defending this wallet as I think it's fairly clear it sets up two wallets ("core" just seems petty but whatever). 
But I didn't explore the "buy Bitcoin" button and I concede that this is unnecessarily misleading for newcomers. All BTC / BCH debate aside, that's not right. It doesn't help crypto.

If you bought the entire supply of BTC it would not cost $112B. Not even close. Market Cap is the value of all circulating supply at the most recently traded price, not the cost to buy up a whole supply.

I don't think that's how sewing works

This is a really good explanation of buying on leverage. Hope you don't mind me using your example to explain the liquidation part to others: 
You put up $1,000 and borrow $9K from the exchange to fill a $10K btc buy order. Now you owe the exchange $9K. 
If your $10K position ever decreases to $9K then the exchange will liquidate your position to recover their $9K. You will be left with $0 hence the higher risk of leverage (Price dips 10% but you lose 100% of your initial $1,000).
Shorting is similar except you borrow BTC to sell, and need to buy it back (ideally at a lower price) to return to the lender. In this case you don't actually borrow from the exchange. Other users Lend btc on the exchange in return for "safe" returns via interest.

"...anymore". Posted a week ago. 
Not saying I believe it, but you're missing the point in that tweet

Thanks i hate it

I didn't misread your comment

Telling people to borrow credit to invest crypto is pretty irresponsible.

I expect the additional fee is to cover the downstream transaction costs of consolidating BTC from all sales to trade back to fiat. They have additional transactions to carry out to realise these funds after your purchase.

Just beautiful

Wow.. letting someone walk off with your card is a huge No in any place I've lived. So you just give it to the waiter and trust them not to skim the details out back?? 
The US really is pretty backwards when it comes to payments... You can't say "credit cards work really well" if that's how it's working over there.
@_date: 2019-04-29 08:21:52
How does the waiter know how much to swipe your card for if they don't know what tip you're giving them? Thanks for reply but would still feel far more awkward for me to watch someone walk away with my card. Apple pay is a winner though, only recently started using that.

Is it bad that I haven’t installed any apps/software and just use the device with MEW for erc20 tokens?
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:00:28
Just like gold did
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:44:33
Well it was never "literally" worthless. It's always been worth someone's time, effort, electricity, and resources.

I’m going to sound like a “shill” but keep an eye on Monaco Card. They are attending money 20/20 in a couple weeks and have promised card launch before then. They’ve fallen short a couple times tho so we will see.. 
Not sure of roll out dates to S.America but if you have overseas address you may be able to work something out (from your post u sound like expat?)
Otherwise in Aus we have Living Room of Satoshi, which allows you to pay off bills with crypto. Maybe similar options are available in SA.

Aahh.. I thought it was suggesting BTC is a pyramid scheme ...

I think that's monthly given all the other salary/pension demands were monthly amounts. But still...

Good luck man. Sucks that happened to you. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:49:43
But they did pay for it. In all the ways I mentioned. Someone is going to the trouble of mining it.

Doesn’t anyone else think poli is a bit shady? POLi used to say they were “approved by CBA”. That’s never been the case, check CBA website - they say they don’t condone it.

I can compound 34.9 forwards and see you are right, but how did you work that out backwards?

Would a tenx Visa card work?

what about this img suggests polo in 4 days?

Aww thanks
