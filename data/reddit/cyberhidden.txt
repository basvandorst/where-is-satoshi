Read satoshi’s white paper and highlight the true meaning of bitcoin not just investing in it, but the purpose of using it as a currency one day, and sending money to all over the world with no inconvenience  any amount $1-1m

So just to make sure I understand lets say i take 1 of my coins from electrum transfer it from there to bittrexx and I would get an equal amount of “superbitcoin” for free?
