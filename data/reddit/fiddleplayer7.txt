You are right, my mistake.  Commie sob's

It did not say make bitcoin great again!!  It was a trump hat!!  Stop the fake news!
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:48:15
Talked about for years, yes, but technology is changing and so are the young minds.

Still waiting for coinbase to show 1K, so I can rub it in to my buddy who thought I should sell it when it hit 700.00:)
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:45:17
Chocolate? Ha!
Arturo fuente. Only the best!!!
@_date: 2017-01-04 04:00:18
What second hand market?  I want one.
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:08:51
Set up a wallet and transfer into it.

Chinese yuan devalued 7%. Bitcoin rose 0ver 100%!
 
    Watch the Chinese, they are the principal players.
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:08:52
Already did!

Exuberance is often fleeting..
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:58:44
Thinking of selling 5 when it hits1K
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:42:24
I actually have been working on a dingle arm:)
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:23:03
It's called profit taking I believe.

If anyone has one, I would like to buy!

Thinking of selling this week on anticipation of an upward surge once mainstream has to report on it.  
Maybe just enough to get my original investment back.
@_date: 2017-01-01 16:51:29
I say go for it.  Mom and dad won't kick you out will they??
@_date: 2017-01-05 06:03:20
I believe unless you have it in cold storage offline you re still using a third party wallet.  Cold storage like trezor is off line.

Bankers are smart......:(.   We always trust a banker!
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:40:53
Will be selling half when it reaches parity with gold!
@_date: 2017-01-04 02:21:09
Is there any place I can buy one like this?
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:43:07
Chinese are trying to regulate outflow of currency from mainland, people are scared.
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:40:34
Peter has no idea like the rest of us where Bitcoin is going.  Seems to me he is hedging his bets a little so when Bitcoin takes over gold he won't look like a complete fool.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:29:53
Are we going out in a drug induced blaze of glory??
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:40:57
That lasted 1 second for me.  Can't stand the yelling!
Get professional and lose the emotion!
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:42:52
Buy a cheaper house. Sell some Bitcoin and buy gold or silver and freeze dried food.  And keep 10btc for fun.

What I do is keep a working amount...500.00 or so in my coinbase wallet and use my shift debit card with it.  I keep the rest in cold storage on my trezor.
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:01:41
Left the room to tell my wife and the dang dog thought it was a bone and buried it somewhere in the yard...... Crap!
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:22:24
I learned a while back that when price is going up, coinbase tends to set on your money:(
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:21:03
I have a few ether in my gdax account.  Will it still be there?
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:10:48
Can anyone answer my question??
Am I safe having it in gdax account?
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:26:20
Those buyers are dealers that profit off of sales.  Just like a gold dealer.  Buy below spot. Sell above spot, that is their spread.  That's how local Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:56:26
You can send bits.
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:36:50
Is there a wallet that pares to a debit card??

Transaction fees are minuscule 
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:22:15
Sent it in another post about coinbase reminder
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:03:37
Give them to the other person so you don't worry:)
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:16:20
As inept as the irs is??   I doubt if those buffoons even know what it is!!
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:43:15
Don't even understand how that works
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:19:26
Can't figure out how to get the screenshot on here.
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:16:27
Thanks, that makes sense:)
