Destroy bitcoin? Good fucking luck. If you think price has anything to do with destroying bitcoin, you clearly have nfi what bitcoin is.

Except a few differences
1) There's no fraud in bitcoin. Mathematically guaranteed and secured. If CDOs were ran on smart contract, none of that shit would've happened.
2) We are not waiting / asking for government bailout. We don't fucking need it.
3) Bitcoin will never declare bankruptcy.

Dude. I wanted to buy IOTA like fucking ages ago. If only I can hold IOTA on a fucking hardware wallet I would've got some ages ago.
However, shit still stands. You download the complete ledger on IOTA (if that's even possible), you run into the same scalability issue as bitcoin. tx/mb.
I'm not bashing other coins. I'm just fucking sick and tired of the constant bullshit from the media talking about shit they have nfi about.

@_date: 2018-01-16 14:28:26


That is just plain wrong. By that notion, all fiat currency are worthless as well since none of them are backed by gold. Currencies are backed by the GDP that transact them with. The GDP bitcoin actually represent atm is probably minuscule, but to say a currency people transact with has no value is BS.
Also bitcoin tangibly is years of software engineering, testing and deployment. Community work, education, seminar, etc. Basically the "network effect". If you package all that effort into a single company that's poised to replace the global financial scene, yes it's worth hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars.

Are you the guy who created the video? Then I guess there's my opinion. "Crypto Market" is not a bubble. Period. For a number of reasons
* The 13 trillion dollar QE and low rate meant the massive abundance of cheap cash has inflated the price of EVERYTHING. Bond, stock, real estate, everything is sky high.
* There's no derivative market for the crypto (yet. coming soon). When the crypto derivative market comes, you'll see how flat this 250B market is.
* Many crypto currency's operation has absolutely nothing to do with its market cap. The ones that'll be worst hit are the miners. However due to its decentralised nature, most if not all will live on. There'd be mayhem for sure. Bitcoin may need an emergency fork of some kind so it can adjust its difficulty better, etc etc, but they -will- move on.
* There's no house of cards built on top of cryptos (well, again, it's coming. there are places where you can take out loan using bitcoin as collatoral. it's not common, but they starting to appear)
You should put the two graphs to the same scale. The same Y axis. You will see a flat line for the cryptos.
Would the price collapse? Maybe. But the bubble will only bankrupt the privately owned coins. Ripple/dash/etc. Open source coins driven by community? Rock solid.

No. It's that Bitcoin is going to be the first coin to overcome that road block. None of the cryptos can scale past 10 or 100 tx/s atm. Lightning network on bitcoin is going to be the first coin that solves this problem. Bitcoin has transaction congestion because people are using it. This same problem applies to Ethereum.
In software engineering terms, it's called "a good problem to have". Addressing scalability issue when there's no scale to begin with is a waste of time. You address scale issue, when you have a scale issue.

Exactly. This is why the US housing market were absolutely fucking booming in 2008 and innovating relentlessly (in debt repackaging and fraud).
That's also why Germany who has very strict monetary policy is just completely lagging behind in economy and the tech industry. Because it's not racking up 100%+ debt to gdp and throwing it at the military budget. F35 is the prime example of the technological break through of what throwing money at failures can do.
/s in case it escapes you.
If you seriously think cheap cash and failures is what brings break through, you clearly do not understand human nature. China and it's "great leap" threw the entire country's productivity at producing steel and a whole bunch of other shit and there's mountains of failure. Just fuck all success.
Competition is what drives breakthrough. Not socialist incompetence.

Or a hypothetical scenario I was planning:
Say you have a house with mortgage cleared. Mortgage interest is like what? 5%? If your house is worth 500k, you can loan 400k. If you keep 200k as cash, you can easily sustain the mortgage for a decade (or something)
Let's also say you have a 70k salary and losing all 200k = 4 to 5 years of savings. But let's be real, no matter how hard it crash, it'll still be worth anywhere from 5 to 25%, manage it however you want.
Put the other 200k into crypto and profit take accordingly.

At this point in time, Libra has proof of fucking nothing. You get to run master node by paying $10m fiat. Cryptocurrency's cryptography part is only valid if there's proof of &lt;something&gt; to back it up. Stake, work, transaction, you name it.
[ 
It's nothing more than a bunch of data store that runs on paxos. It doesn't even stand up to sybil attack, a problem any crypto worth their salt has overcome. The servers need to do keys exchange that only validate against each other.
If it had proof of stake (which it "says' it intends to use eventually) or something that prevents Fecesbook from tempering with network, sure we have some grounds for discussion. Libra is not anywhere even fucking remotely close.

Just look at how Bcash does a hard fork in a month. They are just a bunch of idiot business man who want the dev to do whatever they are paid for. Now they have two chains.
Oh and S2x froze. And the EDA has ADHD. And the malleability bug is still not fixed (and most likely never will on Bcash).
Nothing wrong with the concept of debating increasing block size to fix current situation. Just not the way these clowns are executing it.

Issue is it's run by bunch of corporates, mostly in China.

@_date: 2017-11-12 05:27:06
Also, the market never cared.
LTC been out for 3 years. Low tx fee and faster confirmation. Didn't really make an impact.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:46:54
Exchange solvency only requires that it holds users' money. Trading is a 0 sum game and not being able to liquidate your position has nothing to do with how much capital the exchange has. It's the trader on the other side of the trade that's giving you the cash not the exchange.
If all users withdraw their money no matter how they trade it, the exchange should have exactly 0 dollars by end of it. If they have less dollars than what everyone's withdrawing, it's theft and fraud.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:27:01
And even with all the immediate benefits, eth didn't over take btc (seemed close for a while, but still didn't)
Then after that, you have LTC for faster transaction time.
That's why Bcash fanboys get soooooo upset when called bcash. If they don't have bitcoin in their name, they have nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:03:02

LN is like maglev.
Imagine LN just between the major exchanges. 0 on chain tx for arbitrage. That probably kills 90% of the transactions going on.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:51:33
Because Visa averages 2k tx/s. Average. They peak 50k+ tx/s. That's "only" visa. Throw in Mastercard, Amex, debit, paypal, bank wire, the whole lot. 50tx/s is really the same as nothing.
Bitcoin has RSK coming (which I have nfi how it works) next month supposedly do 100s of tx/s. Instant. Obviously LN, and apparently channel factory (again nfi how it works, need to find time to read it) 
Also, confirmation time is restricted by block mining time. Averages 5 min. Do you wait 5 min for creditcard? No. Thought so. Credit card is instant. So is LN. Relying on 0conf is like living in the dinosaur age. Time to move on.
I'm not throwing "You have to be pretty fucking retarded to be holding Bcash at this point" out there in vain. Bitcoin is getting the equivalent of maglev with hyperloop coming right up next. Bcash is like road widening. Does fuck all really.
Edit. ROFL 50k tx/sec by increasing block size? Go for it. I can't even be bothered. Just go buy bcash. See where we end up in 2 years time.

Something else to consider. Forget whatever fucking technical issues or whatever out there. Think, if we have even just half a billion people using Bitcoin (or any crypto currency). Let's say they all open a payment channel for lightning network each, once every two or three days. Let's use 7 days for arguments sake.
500MM / 7 (days) / 24 (hours) / 6 (blocks per hour) = 500k transactions per block. we are doing 2k without segwit. Let's do 5k just to be generous with segwit + schnorr + 1MB baseblock. We are 2 order of magnitude away, to just sustain one payment channel per person @ 0.5 billion people. Let alone like IP address nowadays, everyone needs multiple. 7 billion people @ 2 payment channel each? Crazy.
It's not about what we can do now. It's about where we need to go.

Exchange trades do not settle on chain.
BTC mempool getting clogged up was because Bcash was shitting out blocks every min. Of course miners love that coin with difficulty adjustment that has ADHD. Who doesn't like block reward every min instead of 10.
Now their new DAA for bcash is in, Bitcoin went straight back down from 180k to under 20k transactions in about a week. We are not quite at scaling limit "yet". We are clearing 5-10 sat/byte tx now. How much cheaper do people want the tx fee to be?
Also, use Segwit. All those big businesses bitching and moaning about slow and expensive tx do not use Segwit. They are full of shit. Don't listen to them.
Oh btw, Bcash averages 100kb block. Real useful, their 8mb block limit.

People who didn't "recover from 2006" had no business getting into the financial investment they were in. S&amp;P was 1500 peak in 2007. It climbed back to exactly where it were about 5 years later. If you bought at the peak, you only had to hold 6 years + to realise a gain, and that's assuming the absolute worst entry.
People who got wrecked were people who caused the bubble in the first place. People borrowing who clearly were in no position to take out a loan. GFC hits, all the house gets taken away. (Yes yes and there's that whole debt bubble thing.) But the point is, if you had properly planned an interest rate buffer, you should've been fine.

You generally don't loan for shit you don't need, unlike the ponzi frothy bubbly shit arse keynes.
If bitcoin is used as actual money, you'd save for a house, not mortgage for a house. Just like inflationary currency is opposite of deflationary, saving is the opposite of loans.
And you'll get morons screaming how will people ever be able to save up for a house. If it weren't for the frothy bubbly housing market caused by fiat / debt based economy, the property price'd be only a fraction of what they are.
Loans will be reserved for people who are absolutely sure they have a business that actually sells shit people actually need. Your business better have 100% ROI when you have a 50% interest loan (for example).
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:37:44

I agree with you the price is getting a bit a head atm, but it's not that far ahead. People have not caught on yet how fucking epic lightning network is going to be.

Gold vs Bitcoin. I think the horse has been beaten to mash at this point so let's not go there. No need to rehash everything again.


Except you can't.
Bitcoin is like a linux kernel level project. There's only one linux kernel. Yes the devs might make questionable decision, but branching and trying to start your own is quite silly. There's a reason LTC rebase its code on BTC's code. Bcash is a prime example of what happens when a bunch of amateurs try to make a copy of it. (Dysfunctional EDA, time based HF lolololololololol what the actual fuck?)
Have a read through the core dev mailing list, seriously. They are set in the direction of building something that is going to be used for decades and centuries, not a couple of months or years. Fixing congestion caused by a nefarious competitor is not their utmost concern. They are letting the natural market force taking care of it. Debatably questionable and overly bold? Maybe. Contributors with their own agenda? Most definitely. But at the end of the day you really have to read their discussion and appreciate the kind of development going on with Bitcoin.
TLDR, a lot of people think the current price is ridiculous. IMO, the price perfectly reflects the craftsman ship of engineering going on.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:10:37
I'm just joking :p
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:04:40
And in that process you have just increased supply of BTC (1) and pumped part of that money into the futures market (4000). Also the contract is settled in cash.
However, I think because Bitcoin has far superior price discovery compared to PM, it may?? be less prone to future's price manipulation? I dunno. Time will tell. The problem with PM is that its price is basically dictated by the futures. There's no order book for physical PM because it's just impossible. With Bitcoin however, the spot price ?should? be the dominant force?
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:37:46
No. The "success rate" means successfully routing to a target destination. Not payment failure. LN functions on time lock contract and do not "lose" fund. These are money transaction we talking about here. There's going to be 0 chance anyone design any payment mechanism that "has probability" of losing anyone's money. Absolute worst case scenario is if a payment don't go through.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:20:28
Well, we are sort of saying the same thing but not really.
Bitcoin is trusted because it has weathered almost 10 years of constant attacks in an unregulated market. Bcash had 4 months and its holders are not battle hardened like Bitcoin's.
If Bcash want to talk about higher transaction throughput, Litecoin/Eth has it beat.
So, what is it selling for really? A bit higher throughput with the bitcoin name (except without the long term holder)? c'mon.
So far it is nothing other than a coin being used for pump and dumps and left to bleed to death.

No. That's the issue right there. The increased supply creates the increased demand. Most exchanges don't even do the most fucking basic thing such as batching transactions, let along implement segwit.

@_date: 2017-11-16 13:17:23
I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm saying the bad debt alone wasn't what caused the next level shit storm that happened.
Banks gave out the bad debt and then repackaged and sold the pile of shit as CDO with AAA rating stamped on it (which is out right fraud from the ratings agency). Then it's put on the market for people to trade with leverage. Guess what happens when the underlying "asset" blows up and default. Margin calls and the whole thing comes tumbling down.
Bad debt caused a bubble, but the bursting of the bubble causing the bank to all collapse is because of fraud these banks committed. I'm saying the sin on that front is far worse imo.
You don't need regulation. You need to just let the banks die. No amount of regulation is going to fix the effect of the 13 trillion dollar bailout of their own epic fuck up. It's literally incentivising the next fuck up to come.
Edit - funnily that's why Bitcoin was invented. Because of the bullshit that comes from QE.

@_date: 2019-04-10 22:18:24
This explains a bit
[ 
Essentially batching transaction means instead of exchange paying out to one person per transaction, they can pay out to multiple people in one transaction. This is done by specifying one output per payout / pay to person. This means that the transaction itself would include a lot more input and output and all signed in one go and result in smaller tx size than compared to having all tx signed separate. Schnorr will make it even more effecient later on.
This isn't something that can be done after the fact as it'll break the cryptographic hash that prove the authenticity of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:24:04
It's happening. Segwit will help immediate throughput problem. Schnorr is next up.
Mid term, sidechain / LN. Doesn't need business behind them, it's already happening.
You need to understand NOTHING in bitcoin is going to happen quickly (in matter of weeks or even months). We are talking about system upgrade to 10s of thousands of nodes (that we know of) and 100s of thousands of nodes/clients. It's also the backbone / foundation of 100s of millions of dollars worth of IT infrastructure.
Core devs are not completely against double block size. It's all in their dev mailing list. It's just they demand at least 12 months lead time. Minimum.
They might be overly cautious if not somewhat paralysed, but good thing takes time. I am a developer myself and I know exactly how businesses fuck software delivery up for some petty short term gain. That's what Bcash is.

Yes, s2x wasn't a complete bad idea. It's the back handed political manoeuvre that killed it. Look at what happened to the eventual s2x chain launch. Frozen on block 1. The core devs had good reason to reject it and that whole shitshow just goes to show why.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:25:44


You have another problem where 2MB base block requires a hard fork. Essentially afaik, core devs' want to hard fork to solve that problem once and for all and be done with it. They don't want to HF for 2MB only to have to HF again later.
And so essentially the question I ask, imo, is do we have that solution yet, and, if not, is the situation so dire that we need to HF to 2MB. The answer is a resounding no when the rising fee is just due to shitcoin and exchange spams.
The real issue is if the economic incentive for bitcoin to drive other shitcoins / exchange spams out pace bitcoin's utility value. I.e. it's more profitable for spammers to pay fee higher than the average users. If so, that needs to be resolved and be rolled into the HF as well.
Me personally, more than happy to pay up to a couple of dollars per transaction in the near term if that means the well being of bitcoin in the long term.

KYC has absolutely fucking nothing to do with tax. Tax is law while KYC is financial.
4. Collection of tax is largely voluntary to begin with as most expense write off are not audited. Your income is your work contract and these things have traces. Most countries have the employing company paying the employee's income tax anyway so KYC has absolutely fucking nothing to do with income tax in that regard. What the employees do with their money is no one's business.

Also, inequality of wealth is irrelevant, poverty is. If there's no poverty, why the fuck do you care someone else is a gazillion times more wealthy? Bitcoin is not going to eliminate poverty, but then neither has fiat. It's not monetary system's responsibility to begin with.

Bitcoin most likely will beat inflation like you said.

If you going to put it like that, there's no one stopping you from hiring mercenaries to slaughter all the police. The absence of law means the individuals would need what's required to deflect coercion themselves. That should mean that people can deflect the coercion that is called "law" in the first place.
The fact that law can coerce people just means that people can't be trusted not to be coerced in the first place.
The real reality is that law is just a shit show of arbitrary bullshit that achieve fuck all in protecting the general public anyway.

If you think a blockchain being private has any sort of actual use case, you are one of those 99% who doesn't understand what blockchain actually is for. If you want to trust a central authority, gazillion different db technologies trounces whatever the fuck you can do with a "private blockchain".
People want medical record / credit rating to be on the public chain instead of private chain because not a single fucking company has shown to be competent and trust worthy in handling it.

Except it isn't. Having a full copy of the ledger doesn't mean much when at end of day all you doing is receiving the blocks from the big boys with the most hash rate. Everyone on earth can have their own copy of block chain, but if only 1 person is coming up with the next block, everyone listens to him.
Hash rate will always be somewhat centralised in a few pockets of miners and increase/decrease of block size have no impact on it.

Ask yourself this. What's a better way to invest (note, invest, not piss away) your $300 dollars.
Bitcoin is a good one.
However, I can't stress this enough
Go learn what debt based economy is
Every single person on this planet should understand what it is. This will be the best - ever - investment you'll make in yourself.
Go learn what gold standard was and why it was abolished
Go learn what central bank interest rate means
Go learn how equity/bond market works
Go learn about every single economy crash
(You'll see why banks are just full of ****)
Oh, and just a heads up, you'll eventually run into people telling you the economy can't function without inflation, ignore them. They are idiots.
Go read up on keynesian economy vs austrian economy

How massive? The guy earns $2000 and pay $400 rent and don't go lavish on food. argument sake, he has $1000 leftover per month. Let's make it real massive. An entire year's worth of saving into bitcoin and it flops. $12k down the drain.
Big deal. Now he's 22? + He's 21. His salary is only going to increase. He'll work until let's say 65. 40 years worth of work of which he splashed 2.5% of income on. Assuming that his salary doesn't increase. More like less than 1%.
In reality, all he needed to put in was 3 month's worth of saving a year ago ($3000, or 10 bitcoins?) and now he'll have $50k +9k left over salary.
Even if the guy risk away all his savings till 25. That's 4 years, or 16 things he can take risk on. Even investing in start up, you'd hit something 1 in 10.

Ah here we go again. The fallacy of deflationary money.
We are in this pile of cluster fuck specifically because of inflationary money. 1987, 2000, 2008 and the next one. Every. single. fuck up so far. And the next one is going to be no exception. The same old shit show. Fuck, even the ones before abandoning the gold standard. Fucking economy classes blame stagnant consumption. Oh fuck off. Stagnant consumption just means the company prepared for another year of growth and it didn't happen, so oh gee, now they overspent and gotta lay off people. Economy crashed because of lack of growth? That makes so much sense.
We have likes of Uber and Tesla which are in the red for years and Twitter plunges 80% in value. Shit business model is shit business model, except in a debt based economy pigs can fly.
And you think just because the money supply increased the amount of natural resources are increasing? All it leads to is increased consumption and depletion of natural resource. No one's getting any fucking richer. We are just burning the planet up, because, oh GDP growth. All the countries gotta fucking circle jerk over it.
And the loan, even a bigger joke. God forbid people actually pay with money they have, not money they might. For people looking for a way to be a billionaire, it's a bit of a problem. For the average folks, it's perfectly fine. Saving will actually become a thing. Just like how human functioned for millenniums. This whole debt based bullshit was only around for around for barely a century and people already starts to think it's the only way to function. Hilarious.

1) Accepting Bitcoin will give you some PR buzz.
2) Future proof. I am setting it up for my business too. It's not like I have to choose between fiat and bitcoin. Just report the sales in dollar terms. It shouldn't be that much extra work (though as always, talk to certified accountant).
3) It'll be useful for some edge cases? I don't know how car sales work. E.g. people who doesn't have a bank account in US. People who just moved into the area. Etc etc. Something like that.
4) I would say it's actually safer than cash. You can't trace cash. You can trace bitcoin. You can't deny bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin would also be far more difficult to launder money with. (The whole bitcoin money laundering is complete bullshit)
5) Cheaper too, can't reverse transaction. All the usual anti bank establishment crap. blah blah blah.

It's not a bubble because there's no inconsistencies for it to be measured against.
Dotcom bubble bursted because the PE ratio were off the chart (low).
2008 GFC wasn't a bubble. It was banks being fuck wits in the middle of a property bubble. The property would've crashed 25% at most but climbed back if the bank didn't fuck it with bad debt.
Bitcoin is exactly as advertised. The only crash to occur other than a massive technical failure is a mass exodus. That only happens when there's no massive gain a head, which is a long time ahead. 80b is absolutely tiny. By the time it gets to a trillion dollars, it'd have found more use and solved a lot of scaling issues etc (hopefully).
Also, if you want to look at bubble, go look at equity market.

Not so sure about that. Japan is already picking it up. Korea, Russia, parts of Europe, South America, eventually some of US. If it picks up even just a bit more adoption across these countries it WILL worth more than S&amp;P 500. We talking about a global transaction, border-less financial system.
Some day, S&amp;P 500 might even have to live on it, or prefer to operate on it.

Replay protection is only needed if your transaction can be replayed. If you've sent your coins on two chains to the two different addresses and are confirmed, you are safe (AFAIK).

Ah yeah that's very possible. There's always possibilities for things to go south. Heartbleed level kind of bug in bitcoin code, quantum computers, etc etc.

Unfortunately that there's your problem.


But people don't want to do that. They just want to live beyond their means, past present and future. The world has to be rainbow sunshine and unicorn.
You are expecting government / politicians to be responsible. You are expecting countries to budget properly. You are expecting people to not lavishly spend what they don't actually have. You are expecting wealth to be accumulated based on actual correlated productivity, instead of this bubble filled horseshit.
People who has gained the most wealth and people who has most power currently will do everything they can to make sure this shit show keep going. And if it were going under, they'd drag fucking everyone down with it.
I don't hold bitcoin as a believer of its future. I hold bitcoin as a hedge against the time when this whole debt based cluster fuck burns to the ground.
Just playing devil's advocate here.


What? You have to save up for a house, instead of just getting a loan and buy the house right now and letting the government's artificial inflation to make the ends meet?

No. I am talking about having a good reputation is good for business, thus I have to build "trust worthiness". If being "trust worthy" is going to cost me my business, I'm out. I'm also not going to count on business to lose revenue to keep up their "trust worthiness". Of course there's also the trade off of losing revenue in the short run but gaining more in the long run. It's all about the business.
Miners and business can sign whatever the hell they want. I won't trust them, ever, if it means they lose money. Again, it's all business. If you want them to go through with something, you have to put in the correct status quo.
I'm sorry, but just like how we are telling the miners there won't be a 2x, we tell them there's segwit. We are paying them to mine the block we using. Not the other way round.
And no, I don't enjoy segwit. We are dropping validation data. I believe in on chain scaling. I believe there's argument on both side, but the fact that the s2x has no replay protection and that they are putting it in / pulling it out one month before the launch is complete joke. I worked with businesses well enough to know how they make 
What I'm saying is, people get screwed because they "trust people" instead of understanding status quo. The sooner we stop doing that, the sooner we'll keep the business in check.

Awww look at that some kiddo watched a 1 min video and he think he knows how fractional reserve banking / lending works in reality. "I can lend money and I get interest, profit!!111!!!!!"
When your borrowers mass default, you are fucked.
Then when you jack up the interest rate and more people default, you are more fucked.
Then when the government turns around and say "sorry kiddo, we can't print money to bail you out", you are truly totally fucked.
You will end up losing all the money you lent out and be in debt for the 90% that's not in reserve. Great business kiddo.


No shit you autistic fuck. That's what bonds and QEs are. When you tell me you now have 10 btc because you printed an IOU, and you can't actually transfer any to my address, I'll tell you to go get fucked. Are you seriously that fucking stupid.
