I'm mining for a small profit, with what I have, I did set up a large amount at the start and will let it run until it is no longer economical. 
Your point is a good one regarding other people's desire to just go crazy, one smaller point is that HDD's don't scale as well as ASIC miners.. you won't get a doubling of storage space within a few years within a HDD (we're at most, 12TB and a few years ago the maximum was 8, we're looking at most a 50% increase in 2-3 years) and running a farm of HDD's is not for the faint of heart! 
You will never get someone plugging in 100 hard drives if they're not very proficient in hardware and getting it running without headache and general rage-quit. 
I suppose the take home message is 'the rat race is still there, but not a fierce as with POW'

Oh, and i have 3 TB drives from 2009.. which will be used until they die.. my friends who run GPU's would laugh if i suggested running a GPU from 2009 in a miner..

It takes significant time to generate the plot files (for example, 2 days for an 8tb plot, at 100% utilisation of a 16-core server, its not a 'quick' algo like bitcoin) so dumping and re-plotting is not an 'easy' switch..
So you know, bitcoin ore is adopting POC.. bitcoin chain without the POW

Cyprus banks are clueless on such matters, and even though the central bank has said 'they're risky but not illegal' I believe that they have been warned to avoid anything to do with any Crypto currency, I have had 2 people in one bank lie to me about bitcoin transactions, so I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them.

One off cost versus the continuous higher cost of POW. I know that i've been seeing a lot about the amount of electricity that Bitcoin uses.  If you want to compare the energy cost of a hard drive, also factor in the cost of an ASIC miner.. you'll find a HDD costs less to create then an ASIC. so then we're onto running costs.... which i'm sorry but POW loses on.
