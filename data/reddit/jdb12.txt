We have Venmo now.

I didn't do that. I wouldn't say that that's never happened with anybody, but I don't think it's a thing really.
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:33:58
There's a catch. There's always a catch with stuff like this.
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:33:37
Not with that attitude!
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:06:20
This is really great. I love this.
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:33:14
Thanks so much guys for helping us with this!!! It means a lot when two communities like this have a relationship like this.
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:55:03
When two that do that can get over that is what I mean.

What if we already signed up but not under our .edu account since it's for school/work stuff?

What? I'm not trying to piss you off... I'm really confused right now.

Bitcoin is cool and all, but that's just stupid.
@_date: 2018-06-30 18:46:32
This is such shit. Trying to compare this last fall of like 200 days vs a bunch of less than a month corrections FOH

Nope, actually it's the Penile Dysfunction Association.

I love that thumbail... a rabbit over the Confederate flag hahahaha
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:45:20
Still just as far removed from political reality.

There already is no air in China.... it's all just smog now!

@_date: 2018-07-01 00:47:49
Know better than what?
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:12:24
There have been other spikes/downturns, but trying to compare them to this one that's like at least 5x as long is absurd and meaningless.
The one long one is the only reasonablr comparison and that's only one example ina much different situation where there was not the same kind of thing going on with massive amounts of other cryptos.

5 internets? Maybe this whole "information superhighway" thing doesn't work like I thought it did...
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:50:56
Does coinbase not work in Europe?
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:25:35
You sold them at the 192 mark? When were they up that high?
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:38:20
I thought nobody uses mtgox any more b/c their conversion rates are so far from everybody else's. That's why I use [preev](
@_date: 2013-05-26 00:40:34
That's all I use BTC for.
And for the po-po: I am assuming that "drugs" means "smiles", not "narcotics", ok?
@_date: 2013-05-26 00:46:40
I agree completely, but I'm sure that you and everybody else has to realize that people doing this is inevitable.
Ok I know a bunch of people have said the exact same thing, but I just need an excuse to say "Every village has its idiot." Not sure why I have such a burning urge to say that. Sorry.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:07:31
Why do you say that high? Last time it crashed it was above where it is now and only got back up to $130ish.
