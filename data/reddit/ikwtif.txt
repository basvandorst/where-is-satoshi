Until it isnt. Do you really have so much faith in the banks with their track record? Currently in my country, I'm only secured for 100k on my bank account. Everything above, if something happens is just gone. And I expect this to go lower and lower in the coming years.

Bitcoin core wallet is implementing segwit, I remember correctly they said they weren't implementing segwit before that happened, probably because they are too incompetent to do it themselves 
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:34:28
There's coinmetro launching their beta in februari, they own fxpig a forex broker. So hopefully have enough experience to not pull the shit coinbase does, and they seem to be focused on transparency and customer support. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:46:22
at this point it's only safe to assume incompetence. I remember recently they said they won't implement segwit before bitcoin core wallet has it. Not surprisingly this just happened

Faith shaken for what? LN is coming, you can already test it, if anything your faith should be better. It's adoption that's killing transactions, look at who is using segwit yet and who doesn't. Companies are holding it back, not the devs

seems strange you bought a drink with it knowing that and the high fees honestly

unless the economy crashes with fiat having massive hyperinflations, I doubt it will happen in 10 years. Remember that innovation happens slowely unless it's needed. If anything, it will be pegged to a crypto made by the banks.

@_date: 2017-12-24 21:17:06
You are relying on other people doing the work to find the solution too. that's a bad argument. Miners had to adopt segwit and did. Some companies already implementen segwet aswell. If people actually cared about scaling and understood, there would be more outrage over segwit adoption than high fees.

I mean...Coinbase hired Roman Shytlman as software engineer who was part of why Bitfloor got hacked, and they only show more and more incompetence each month (still no segwit, bcash fiasco, hoarding utxo's etc). It's just a matter of time before they do something stupid
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:51:06
Define support. Then explain why you support both solutions for the same problem. Honestly, I don't see why you would "support" BCH, they have a very small team compared to btc and basically riding on the bitcoin fame, imo. The only reason for the high market cap is because it was a fork. Why not support a different alt? Why does it have to be bch? Because it has bitcoin in the name?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:00:11
everyone should start using segwit, backlog would be gone, but its at 10% adoption. Don't blame devs for others not implementing the solutions

@_date: 2017-12-30 20:28:10


yeah, that's defenitly what happened....because everyone is using it as a currency.... You think you can use any crypto right now truly as currency with this volatility? You must be joking. Unless you immediatly buy back what you spend with fiat it's not worth it
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:07:22
I know, but many people don't even realise this is happening. They see segwit is here but also that we still don't have low fees. Yet segwit is barely used. I think the focus of the complaint about high fees is just misplaced and should be towards companies not implementing segwit instead. I think slower adoption is fine tough, still enough problems to be solved and people to educate so they don't do dumb things. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:12:40
bitcoin has fundamentals tough. I'd say ICO's are the .com bubble for the most part, altough they aren't really a bubble as they are mostly pump and dumped.

@_date: 2017-12-20 13:38:00
I was implying that every solution is not beneficial in the long run. Do you want quick easy fixes that could cause issues in the long run? Or innovative fixes that are properly tested first? This is a billion dollar market, one small mistake is going to cost a lot of money. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:54:17
While a far less change, it's still life changing for the majority. While yes, you can't blame yourself, plenty of people would not be able to cope with losing life changing money because of a descision they made. Just look at all the people panicing when it drops 20% when it had a 60% increase. Too many people are not stable enough to cope with something like that.

@_date: 2017-12-29 13:46:08


Yet I'm able to be on an exchange and have a hardware wallet supporting segwit for like a month now. Just because they are not willing/slow to adopt it doesn't mean they can't. Just look at what coinbase is doing, hoarding utxo's because of incompetence or negligence and congesting the network more in the process while still not having implemented segwit, yet added bcash and most likely add another coin januari. They just have the wrong priorities.

I'd say they imply consensus rule change that's not backwards compatible. Because they also imply no chain split. So feels weird to say one or the other when they both can happen.  But maybe that's wrong because it is a chain split either way, it's just that the old one doesn't continue.

But it's flattening out while the needed storage would grow exponentially.


Segwit exists, ask the people and exchanges that do not seem to care enough to adopt it. It would solve the current scaling issue. It's better to implement 2nd layer solutions now, it's already hard enough to get everyone to use segwit, imagine if we had to implement it in a year with a lot more adoption. It's just going to be harder. Now it's time to lay the foundations, not "easy fixes". 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:21:22


I'd argue that in a lot of places bitcoin isn't accepted for payment anyway, ethereum on the other hand needs to support several projects right now in place, and has trouble with just cryptokitties. Bitcoin can be used as a store of value for now, there are alternatives for currency. Ethereum on the other hand, if it fails to support apps, is a lot worse off than btc having slow/costly transactions because people will look for alternatives, and what does ethereum have to support itself when that happens? Qtum will even let people easily switch their app from Eth to their network I believe. And ethereum clearly isn't keeping up with demand if one project can congest the network like that...it's going to deter people from creating apps, again, a much bigger issue than what bitcoin has
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:36:39
problem is, we already have things like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold etc. It's just going to confuse people. And as long as Btc isn't used as a true currency, or increases dramatically, I don't think we need it just yet. An option to switch on exchanges between sats and btc would be nice for people who want it and to gradually introduce that idea to more people, but I don't think it should be the main focus for now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:15

@_date: 2017-12-24 15:55:55
we need segwit adoption as well, only at 10%. people complain about high fees but if the created solutions arent even used....it's not magically being solved by itself
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:56:19
What does that have to do with anything? I was stating my opinion and asking questions because bitcoin cash does not bring anything innovative to the table. They are just using one solution for the current scaling problem by tweaking a few rules because they do not agree with the solutions core is going to implement. What are they going to do when the next scaling issue presents itself? Even bigger blocks? I'm not asking to be pro core, but there are better alts out there to serve as a currency. So, again, why support bitcoin cash? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:05:31




well looks like you changed your mind on that then
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:53:12

@_date: 2017-12-24 21:56:42
I don't think it's just a black/white case regardless. Mass adoption as true currency with this price volatility won't come soon. Then you have exchanges like coinbase who hoard utx's, piling them up and making the mempool fuller than it needs to be, not adopting segwit, etc. you always have to rely on everyone to do the "best" thing. That will never happen. But I don't think adoption is dropping because of tx fees at all. Creating 2 HF's as a temporary fix is not good either imo.

@_date: 2017-12-24 20:19:18
It's not about needing to trust bitcoin companies. It's about people complaining about high fees while they keep using companies that don't use the solutions in place. It's the community holding back bitcoin because of convenience and not understanding what is happening. If everyone would press companies they use to actually implement segwit, or switch to companies who actually do, it will happen faster. But no, complaining about it everywhere is the norm these days while nothing changes. 10% adoption rate since the launch of segwit while everyone is still complaining about fees instead of complaining about segwit adoption.  The backlog would dissapear if everyone would use segwit.

And not see the dip to buy more? You want all those cheap bitcoin for yourself?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:23:24


that's in like 2140, long way to go. And fees weren't even originally in Btc, they were introduced as a deterrend for spamming the blockchain with spam transactions to congest the network. Mining verifies transactions, it is a big sustaining force behind bitcoin. The question is, why would they not mine when they have this much invested in it? Not mining would make the network useless, and at the same time their investment.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:46:04
Because running a node for a network you are invested in to basically keep it running and to add more security so you don't lose your value has to be paid for? If everyone tought like that we would not have any nodes
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:52:00


should already happened, backlog would be gone. Only at 10% segwit adoption. people screaming high fees, but not pressuring their exchanges/wallets to actually implement it or shift over to those who do. ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:04:13
But you are asking why they don't propose 2MB blocks when they already have an option in place to postpone until LN. It's segwit. Wich has currently only 10% adoption. Blame everyone not using segwit. My point is that everyone complains about high fees, but who is actually using segwit or advocating to their exchanges/wallet devs to implement it instead of complaining why the devs aren't doing anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:22:23

that's horrible advice tough. There's no investment you should make and not follow it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:14:33
I never said it's the end all be all, but it's a short term solution until LN. We now have 2k transactions per 10min block, segwit would increase that to about 8k from what I read. That's 4x. And there's around 180k utx. While not solving high fees entirely, it would solve the backlog for now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:31:49
yes, but harder to store safely than just manually writing the key down imo
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:56:12


Segwit introduced block weight compared to the old block size measurement for blocks. This is technically an increase


"Reducing the need for the lightning side chain" until we get more adoption. Unless you are willing to keep increasing block sizes exponentially. The scaling issue isn't going away, it's just the beginning. Segwit would already clear the current backlog if it had high adoption but it's hovering around 10%. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:03:55
To be fair, BCH had a lot more marketing behind it because of Roger Ver. He's been promoting BCH on his website bitcoin.com and mainstream media since forever. All the controversy it created made it stand out. Do you hear anything about other forks? Barely. Do you know how many are lined up in the coming month? +10 hard forks. And at this point there are so many, a lot less people care about them. Plus people being burned like with the bitcoin gold official site linking to a scam to claim your coins. Again, while yes, bch offers something, I don't see why you would use it over other alts as a currency. Bigger blocks is an easy temporary solution, bch's team has proven nothing yet that they would be able to tackle the scaling issue in a different way besides "bigger blocks". And regardless, with the current volatility in crypto, I don't see any of them being used as cash unless the price volatility settles more
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:24:51
Yes I know. My point was that the bitcoin name is what is used in the mainstream media and satochi is not that usefull yet as a unit. And people just like to see big numbers

segwit makes the tx smaller, about 30-40% in terms of fees. But if everyone used segwit, more transactions in a block, less or no on backlog, so less higher fees needed to get the transaction picked up ontop of the smaller size of the tx.

the question is, why sell on exchanges when you can sell OTC without actually pushing the price down like this, essentially ruining future income from selling mining profits
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:26:11


why, they probably make a lot taxes on btc profits. Assuming the price would collapse to nearly nothing is like saying everything that's illegal should be nearly free. That's just wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:52:47
yes, 'he dais some dumb things"  was a bit too harsh. And interviews are always skewed by the interviewer. I just feel all the essence of what crypto stands for has been neglected in the interview. why should people use crypto when they can just use gold/silver. if they know nothing about crypto, this interview isn't going to make them any wiser.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:21:35


That's not true though. There is a deviation, its not just "every 10minutes", thats just about the mean block discovery time. 
And assuming half of the miners would disappear, the difficulty is only adjusted every few weeks.  A lot less miners -&gt; less chance to discover a block -&gt; longer times between blocks. So blocks would take a lot longer until the difficulty is adjusted back to getting 10min blocks

This has nothing to do with hating, it's common sense. 


A couple hours to look up everything, then digest, analyse and evaluate all that information and come to the conclusion that you should put nearly all your liquid savings into it? If you are a remotely intellectual individual, you aren't going to put all your liquid savings into one asset in the first place, let alone something you looked up superficially in a couple of hours. 


There is a big difference here. What do you define being a part of it. This can range from actually using bitcoin to make payments, running a node, getting into lightning network, etc. If you are just going to pour your savings into it "to be a part of it" and just let it sit there hoping for monetary gains then you aren't really a part of anything in my opinion. That's like parking your money into a savings account and telling people you are part of banking.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:56:55
my point is that "a couple of hours" and "confidently putting nearly all your liquid savings" does not match. I never implied it was a wrong decision, just a bad decision.

Adoption is the driver, just like anything else, wether it's a product or service. Ofcourse bitcoin doesn't have a product, that's the whole point. 


The user data has value, to other companies. But Facebook itself doesn't if it has no users. Just look at myspace for that. Users are the driver.

You don't have to believe me just check for yourself. Less than 3 weeks ago there was barely 2MB in the mempool, yesterday it was 46MB. It's all spam. Bitcoin has not that of a daily use for these spikes, most people either hold it or have it on exchanges, that's just the sad truth.

 If you looked at bitcoin first years you could say it didn't offer that. And it's not what Bitcoin offers.
Value is just increased buy-in, network effects, which plays into the scarcity mechanisms that are intrinsic to traditional “gold standard” stores of value and tokens (digital or otherwise). A pyramid scheme is only sustainable by the continued input of idiots and their money to then be distributed. Bitcoin is the product. And if Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, it’s much less of one than the traditional banking system. So at the very least it's an improvement.

All depends on when the economy will fail again I think, because it's most likely being to be worse than before since they have solved absolutely nothing that caused the crash in the first place. The only "solution" is stealing the general population's money to solve their incompetence. But I don't think anything is predictable at this point honestly. Look how fast the internet evolved, things can go fast with the right momentum. Bitcoin will never be accepted as world currency because they can't manipulate it, the only thing we need is adoption.

Facebook growth in value is more user data, so users drive it. Without its users and the ability to throw commercials at them it has nothing either. Add to that, +270m fake/double facebook accounts generating revenue.
Youtube, commercials with views, views wich are easily artificially inflated with bots. A platform thriving on user content and users viewers.
Bitcoin itself is not a ponzi sheme because the only promise it makes is to be a decentralized currency, it does not offer gains or losses. It's like calling facebook a ponzi because there are several people invested in it who try to convince people to invest aswell.

You should say "cash out in fiat". Using bitcoin doesn't affect the price. Buying and selling with fiat or other crypto does. Bitcoin price is demand/supply based. It's like saying fiat value would go down because it is being used, that does not make sense.


No, the price would not crash with a withdrawal of a couple million dollars. Btc market cap is currently 125 Billion. Btc in the last 6 months had a marketcap decline of 20 BILLION USD in just 3 days (from 71 billion to 51 Billion). There was a price "crash" of 600usd (~17% of the price). Yet you claim a couple million dollars could crash Btc.

why would reduced availability increase demand. the supply is still increasing. But price is mostly determined by supply and demand on exchanges. if miners sell it OTC and it never gets on an exchange then there is not much change because of the halving besides a hype effect. i think those claims are way too simplified.

1. not true, exchanges don't do tx's all the time to other wallets. could be a cold storage wallet 
2. What if they are just cleaning adresses with small amounts?
3. Why would you assume this is all their funds? exchanges use plenty of different wallets
If you look at tx's 
Take [this tx]( This moved 0.00287894 BTC to "whale" adress. 
But also 3.61409535 BTC to [adress_2](
adress_2 send to [adress_3]( but adress_3 also made tx's to the whale adress
What can we conclude from this? That we can only speculate regarding these tx's. But I'd doubt these are not related to exchanges.

if bought from an exchange, most of high value buys/sells happen OTC and won't affect the exchange prices. And I agree, people always think adresses are persons. Plenty of them are from exchanges.

@_date: 2019-09-27 18:20:51
Oh I know. I don't think it will matter that much. We don't even know the ratio of BTC actually on exchanges, most is probably sold OTC and does barely affect exchange prices. What's on the exchanges (or basically, what is easy to be sold/bought) is the true supply with which sets the price by having enough market participators, not what is generally moving or not moving. Someone could sell/buy 500k btc OTC and it would affect nothing on the exchanges. so I would argue there is more possibility of more supply influx on exchanges at some point since what is moving on exchanges will be much lower than what the currently moving on the chain.And what is moving is also the change, every time you do a transaction, so technically there could be a lot more btc not moving. Technically would just be btc on "active adresses". Unless it's taken into account in the study, might have missed it because I just skimmed the text

You are talking about hard forks, big difference. Also still not true regardless, hard forks should be treated on a case to case basis, you can't generelize it like that.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:55:13
very basic but something like this
Soft fork: narrowing (/adding) rules so the broader rules are still valid (segwit: seperation of digital signature and transaction data)
Hard fork: major change in the rules so both versions are not compatible/change in the rules that are already in place (segwit 2x - bigger blocksize)
But there are more kind of forks. For example, Bitcoin has "regular" forks about every week: [fork](

With some bigger buys depending on what happens

The idea is that the price of Bitcoin increases in the long run because of the nature of the system. As long as there is more adoption and trust stays solid it will keep rising in value. That is if bitcoin succeeds, it might as well not.
So it's not about the time it takes for the transaction but the likely value bitcoin will have at a later date. If a seller sells his good for bitcoin at a discount he will keep onto the bitcoin until bitcoin at least gets to the original value without the discount.

I'll probably order the trezor hardware tomorrow to store my bitcoins long term and use electrum on my PC for small amounts and short term. 
At least a 10 year investment for the bulk of Bitcoin I get is the goal. Ofcourse depending to how everything goes because who knows what the future holds.

why not just buy half a coin and see what happens. you can always buy the second half if you feel like it
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:12:35
I haven't had Bitcoin on an exchange, but I assume, you can still track transactions to verify if they actually went trough? I also wouldn't call it fake bitcoin because adressing it like that just scares off people who know nothing about bitcoin, and it's not true regardless. Also, what stops exchanges from actually just using people's bitcoins to influence market prices?
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:19:18
In regards to downtimes, I also (maybe even more) meant things like the website being hacked, shutdown etc. I'm, at least for the most part, going to be in it for the long haul. But might trade smaller amounts, and possibly do small investments in Ethereum for more short term, maybe even at some point get a mining setup for altcoins, who knows. But that's all way too soon for me at this point as I first want a good understanding of what I'm doing and how to do it properly.
Like I said, I haven't even bought anything yet at this point. I'll probably just jump in in a day or two tough, because regardless there is no way of going trough all the information out there within a reasonable timeframe. I'll just have to learn while doing it I guess
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:59:58
my strategy: small increments, but potentially buy more when price hits the last big peak again. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:00:31
Or just wait to see if it drops further , if it gets to the max it was then buy. Because you expect it to go up anyway if you hodl.

impression of their system right? Not bitcoin itself I assume
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:43:32
He just means with a hard fork you'll get double the coins. If you have 1 BTC you'll get the same amount of BCC. The thing is, most likely the whole will be worth less than what you have now

There's a lot that can happen to not remember your seed. From just forgetting, sickness, an accident
It's good to have it as backup, but I don't think you should solely rely on it.

isn't the selling trough paypal the issue? Since once you send bitcoin you don't own it anymore, but you can always stop your paypal transaction
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:46:38
Regardless of wether he's being right or wrong. Waiting it out 2~3 days if you plan to hold 10 years anyway won't really matter. As eventually, it seems he was right "or lucky" about the first dip
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:22:24
I'm not sure I understand what you mean. I guess you can supposedly sell bitcoin but never deliver. But you can't make fake bitcoin so I fail to see how you would be able to sell fake bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:22:47


From what? Nothing is 100% safe. Your best bet is probably a paper wallet

If you can't get attention trough their support for 200k being blocked, making a reddit post and hoping it's noticed is a better option than directly contacting somewhere else on any social media? Sure...

BTC is an implementation of the technology. Blockchain is the technology

@_date: 2017-07-31 19:25:02
it probably won't be worth much no. Majority that get's BCC will probably sell them off very quickly. But some exchanges won't support BCH so they'll be literally stealing it from people...maybe influencing the price. Who knows
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:15:19
What ignorance. I don't think you realise what bitcoin stands for when you say things like 


@_date: 2017-07-26 20:18:47


This, somehow I don't really believe accusations on reddit without any proof by someone claiming to have 200k on an exchange that thinks making a post on reddit is the best solution instead of going to a lawyer.

so you can't be a loser as long as you have a lot of money? interesting
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:20:55
What do you mean? That's what it's about. Everyone wants to hold onto bitcoin. But because of the nature of bitcoin paying for a good at the same price of fiat money it's not interesting. There needs to be a discount where the buyer wants to give up his bitcoin for something tangeable now, and the seller knows he can get at least the same value out of bitcoin later. Nobody says you need to use bitcoin to buy it. But to make it remotely interesting for the buyer to give up his bitcoin there needs to be a discount. At the current state it's not going to be interesting anyway I think
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:39:46
At this point you are just dreaming. There is absolutely zero indication fiat is going to be dropped soon because it is so easy to manipulate. How do you expect people to govern digital currency when so many people still barely can work or even have access to a computer or have basic skills to secure their own money. A better approximation would be that a good amount of people will stop using fiat money on a daily basis, or even at all. But to think fiat will be gone is just ridiculous imo.

Yes. I tought my statement was obvious, I guess not.

Soon? Most unlikely. Fiat will stay present for many decades. Do you even know how invested people, companies, governments are in fiat? What are they going to do with all their debts when they can't print their money anymore? 
And besides that, Bitcoin still will face many issues we don't even know yet.

So you want to put internet traffic even more behind a paywall? It's already enough with data caps, you want them to charge per packet? Besides it not being a guaranteed income compared to a monthly subscription for ISP's, this would only hurt the consumer. 
And why put thrust into an ISP in the first place.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:10:45
If current fees go down, mining essentially becomes more expensive than today then right? (I guess if the price remains stable) Isn't there a risk that only big companies will be able to make a profit from mining, wich seems to be  what is already happening. Aren't we then just creating centralised decentralization? Where essentially companies are running mining groups big enough to change the rulers of bitcoin so they can eventually change the rules?
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:15:44


no no no no no no.....don't ever assume anyone knows what happens within 5 years. If you invest in Bitcoin, assume you will lose everything.
For several reasons Bitcoin might be gone by then, but the technology (blockchain) is what will remain. For example, imagine on the news there is a terrorist attack, and it is found they paid for several things with Bitcoin. Do you imagine the impact something like this will have? 
And if you think Bitcoin won't be attacked in those 5 years, I suggest you watch this:

which law?
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:42:30
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but why is it that miners get to charge a fee but people running nodes not? If there is nothing to mine anymore, will fees still be high enough to make mining even interesting at all? 
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:10:53
it was for context. Trump is an idiot but it's not like Hillary would have been a better option. It would have been the beginning of the end regardless. But people being more hyped about his spelling errors than his policies is just sad. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:20:51
If you believe in anonymity you haven't done your research. 
Also, you should care more about the technology behind Bitcoin instead of bitcoin itself.
