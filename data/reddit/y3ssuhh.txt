What's the best way to move btc without consuming it? I was looking into bitlending, any thoughts? Recommend any legitimate lending sites? Thanks.

So the miners dictate the fees?? People w hardware control the miners.. would that mean whoever controls the higher hash rate has more influence over the fees? How do pools play into this.. the concept is people mine together right? I used to mine a couple years ago at ghs rate using slushs pool and I don't remember or never paid attention to what the fees were to withdraw btc to my wallet.. I'm sure it was there but it never affected the speed of my transfers..

Who's to say a giant corporation decides it wants to throw tons of dollars to buy up a majority of the hash power simply to take advantage of any profit that can be made by fees

I'm a little faded so please correct me if I'm wrong... it sounds like we are paying extra for the luxury of speed transactions?

how horrible is this idea... like lets say i throw an online fundraiser where donators get access to my teamspeak server with channels to network, listen to my dj buddy mix, play e-sports together, meet cam girls, or chaturbate with eachother, things like that. but anyway the funds would be used to give to a project or start-up. 
it would be like throwing a digital party.
