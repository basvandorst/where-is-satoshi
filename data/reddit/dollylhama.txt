Thanks! I’ll pass that on to him.

I certainly care what the majority of the community here thinks, just not that guy. Immediately assuming I’m lying. 
I just texted my brother about this, it says 201 because he scaled the width of the browser window to fit everything in, and it equally shrunk each of the table columns. Anyone with a GDAX account can confirm this is what happens.

Haha please show me where. I’ll give you your single upvote and maybe bring a small spark of meaning to your life.

Rebranded means they changed their name, C3PO. In January 2014 they were called something else.

HAHA. This guy. Speaking from the premise that I actually care what he thinks. I’m not lying, it’s 100% true. My brother told me 2014, maybe it was actually 2015 or 2016? Who cares. You honestly think I would go to the effort to photoshop something like this and then leave the year as 201? I don’t know why it’s like that. Find something better to do with your time big guy.

Haha except the bitcoins are actually real and nothing about my post is fake. 
Your mom told me to tell you that dinner is ready, come upstairs. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:13:59
Yeah my post is a bit inaccurate I’ve learned. He bought the BTC somewhere else, transferred into GDAX Jan 2015. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:10:45
It was a transfer not a buy. He transferred into GDAX January 2015. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:54:02
Yeah my dates are off, sorry. He transferred to GDAX around that time, he didn’t buy it then. He bought it way earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:37:50
This is going to be an awkward dinner then.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:17:16
Hahaha, not until you said something. That’s funny.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:11:54
You’re right! $10k extra is nothing to shake a stick at.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:12:11
Ok. Downvoted.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:09:50
$1k I’m terms of a financial investment is next to nothing. It was just a speculative buy.
