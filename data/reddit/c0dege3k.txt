I'm running FF on an ArchBang Linux installation, and the addon page is saying it's not available for my platform.
I definitely would love to be able to use this.

Hideman VPN also accepts Bitcoin already with per day service. Unfortunately, they don't have a Linux client.

You're not saying you bought them immediately right? And if you are, what sorcery are you working?

I've been noticing their problems, but they are the only ones that I've found that let you withdraw/deposit straight into/from a bank account, which lets me not have to drive 45 minutes to send a BitInstant deposit.

I don't think I did that, but I reentered my account info anyway. Now to see if anything different happens.

This is extremely assuring for me, as I just bought at the peak of this week and have been having second thoughts this weekend.

Good god. I'm ashamed to still be in that age group.

As someone relatively new to Bitcoin, I've been wondering: what will cause a crash at this point? The way I see it, people are just gonna buy at 200 because they don't want to be regretting it at 1000. Short of a computer error or a much larger acceptance rate that will bring in unknown variables, what could cause a crash?

That was quick! Let's try this again:

I'm looking to get my first btc with part of my tax return... Should I buy some now at 40, or wait it out? Or is the price just gonna keep going up?
