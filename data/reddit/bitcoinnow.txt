You are correct. People setting up exchanges in the US need to be very careful. Bitfloor just shutdown. Probably because of some kind of AML violation. The guy running this place  set up a storefront. If he doesn't have a money transmitter license, he is just asking for problems. Most prosecutors love publicity. If they set their sights on you, they can ruin you without even getting a conviction. Please consult with a lawyer before making any significant BTC to dollar exchanges with random people in the US. 
That said, it looks like FINCEN will allow the purchasing of items with bitcoins from businesses without those businesses having to get special money transmission licenses, which is very good. (IANAL)
I believe that bitcoin can still flourish under these conditions in the US.

He is a scumbag because he doesn't want people to protect themselves from the continuing economic destruction by putting some of their money in gold.
He is also a scumbag because he is a rich asshole whose butt was saved by the billions in bailouts, yet he says the common man should "suck it in and cope".
Of course one should buy their preps first if they think a collapse is coming. Gold is really for any additional money one wants to save for what economic system rises after a collapse. If you think that you're going to be buying food and guns with your gold during a collapse, you're going to end up robbed and murdered.

Charlie Munger hates gold (for serfs like us to own, not for him):




tl;dr: Charlie Munger is a scumbag.
