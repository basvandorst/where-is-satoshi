So what happens if you input a sell order at market right now? Do you get the price at the time when you entered the order? Or do you get the price whenever it actually confirms, at some later time/date?

No BTC proponents have ever articulated the systems in place for easy/quick/efficient(low cost) arbitrage b/w the various BTC exchanges.
If each exchange is offering a different spot price of BTC/$....how can you be sure as a BTC consumer that you are getting the **best** conversion price to USD?

Because they were more concerned with selling their total quantity of 30k than slowing their selling rate and piecemealing it out over time.  You see it all the time in any securities market.

I invite you to research the Japanese yen's price swings over the past few years.  I'd say it has been pretty volatile.  Its all relative though.

So you believe the MtGox BTC/$ spot price is elevated (versus other exchanges) b/c MtGox does not have the adequate $'s to pay out the people interested in 'cashing out' their BTC for $'s?
If yes, why doesn't MtGox go to one of the other cash-rich exchanges (that also happens to have a LOWER BTC/$ exchange rate) and sell their BTC for that exchanges $'s, in order to then process their internal client's withdrawl requests?

I see extremely little discussion about the taxation of Bitcoin.  I think most people fail to realize that whether or not they convert their bitcoins back to fiat ($) they're *supposed* to report any unrealized cap gains to to the IRS **every year** (like how a FX speculative investment is handled.)  One unlucky audit and you might be screwed.

Ah, the ponzi scheme that is fiat "currencies" like gold futures and BTC

IMO this bubble could continue until the US govt. regulates it, then mainstream adopters of Bitcoins evaporate.
I don't mean blocking the P2P transactions directly -- I understand proponent's claims that "it's anonymous" etc., and the P2P transaction network can't be taken down -- I mean that the govt. will ban (worst case) or regulate (best case) *businesses from accepting bitcoins* if those businesses want to do business in the USA, on the grounds that Bitcoins could be used to manipulate terrorist financing, crime syndicates, etc.  Then you will see a major reset in perceived BTC valuation vs. the $ when all these businesses that "are now accepting bitcoins!!!!1!" all drop it in a heartbeat.  Most of the businesses that HAVE accepted it thus far have done so in what seems to be more a publicity stunt (the Casino's accepting it, the Subway franchisee, etc.) or ideological reasons (Overstock's CEO is a die-hard libertarian.)  
So BTC-accepting businesses will go rogue you say?  Well, the individuals representing those businesses had better not be US Citizens or they'll get hit with embezzlement.  
I'd *almost* argue that it's imprudent for the mgmt of a big business to announce they're going to adopt it now (and start collecting BTCs in any capacity that isn't **immediately** converted back into $) b/c of the upcoming legal/regulatory risks that are totally undefined as of now.  If it ultimately does get the banhammer, then the mgmt of these early-adopter companies will be held accountable for the capital spending and investments they've already made in BTC-related-tech/systems/personnel that have gone kaput.

Just for reference for those wondering, the $15M they're projecting in expected BTC sales in '14 is 1.07% of the $1.4B total sales.

that would have even more dire implications if the exchanges are simply brokering (as agent) transactions between end-users and inhibiting withdrawls

if you can't convert them to dollars reliably...you *probably* want to blow them and spend them now while they still have value before "most" BTC proponents figure out their pixels are worth less than they currently perceive
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:29:11
I guess it's all predicated on eventually converting back to fiat to 'buy stuff' (or invest, save, etc.)  Unless we can start buying planes, cars, etc., in btc terms.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:14:27
Or outlaw any mainstream businesses from accepting it a la patriot act AML regs...IMO betting on Bitcoin's widespread acceptance is betting on the government ceding monetarist and institutional power (which seems to me like something they aren't going to be interested in doing)

1 BTC = ~$625.  0.1 BTC = ~$62.50.  They're pricing an institutional research report for $62.50...that's the underside of a 2100 share trade at .03 per.
