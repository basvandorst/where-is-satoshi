It's around 14200-14300. Don't know why Blockfolio would be saying 10k.

What now?

Update on kraken:
I fell asleep at my desk. In a dream, the ghost of a butterfly from the future whispered to me "the dollar hit 0 bitcoin". I wake up, people around me dabbing the blood from their eyes. Progress has been made but not enough. I crack my whip -- "we aren't getting to zero like this!". The flogging will continue until morale improves. Expect another update after I make my rounds. I'm sorry I've let you down."

Can anyone explain why you sometimes see a series of regular (eg, every two seconds) buys or sells of the same size. Someone has been selling 0.02btc every 2 secs for the last hour or so on GDAX. Why?

Make a plan and stick to it.

I agree mostly with your sentiment, but where on earth was bitcoin selling at $7300 in the last 8 hours?
EDIT: I just realised that you probably meant days, in which I'm just being a pedant. Apologies.

Gdax refusing to go over 11400, every other exchange seems to have made it though

@_date: 2018-03-03 13:01:28
Which means the opposite will happen, right?
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:16:52
Then why are you on a bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:34:20
Popped above on gdax, admittedly briefly
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:30:56
Well it was fun
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:38:10
Also on bitfinex and binance.

Nah, it's pretty standard, lots of people will have put sells to trigger around 9k, might just take a few stabs to clear them all out. The buying is much higher volume than selling right now, which is a good sign.
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:30:08
IT'S OVER 9000
