You seemed to envy the ambition of the Asians (starving to become rich) over Americans' habit of spending small gains on leisure; I wanted to shine some dark truth to this. That same ambition also drives them to continue gambling with high risk businesses, stock market, actual gambling, and crypto. The risk of losing all of their investment rises as they are never satisfied with the gains. In the end, only a handful out of thousands reach the end without failure. It's common to know someone who has committed suicide because of losing investments. This only applies to my background, Chinese and Korean.

Trust me, U.S Americans are much better. Out of 100,000 Chinese all-inning, one is bound to hit big, which is all we're really exposed to.  The other 99,999 are now employed by that 1, slaving away their lives and children's lives, while gambling away the little savings.

He's ridiculous when predicting prices, but the dude understands the tech like it's his dick.

Kraken support has been shit since the beginning of time.

As Senior IT\-BA, I'm in a lot of meetings and lunch with IT execs. You'd be surprised by how little they know of not just Crypto, but a lot of emerging tech as well; they just have too much on their plate to dig deep into one topic. For Gates, Buffet, and Munger, I wouldn't go as far as "they have no clue about tech" and they sure as hell know the finance. I'd say they know just as much as 99&amp; of subscribers, which isn't saying much.

I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm pointing out that this argument is like Kim Jong-Un and Donald Trump; Kim says "Death to America", trump responds "I'll nuke you". Pointing out that gold causes more destruction and it's less useful is no different from children pointing fingers.

I can't bedazzle my teeth with Bitcoin.

Yup.. better safe than sorry. Doesn't take a data structure guru to know that it won't take Uncle Sam more than a month to link the names to wallet addresses. That's if exchanges report transactions, which they will eventually.

Had a new baby engineer on my team last July right out of school. Young + ambition combo not turn out so hot by end of Q1 2018. His salary (210k) + hefty sign-on bonus, were all dumped on "HOT ALTCOINS THAT WILL MOON".

Shit posts like this one isn't any better than garbage arguments spewed by "experts" on CNN.

I was going to disagree, then saw the name.

Because of idiots not being able to pay off their debt. Way too many people were maxing out their cards to buy the "dip" thinking that crypto is as easy as when they got in (probably 2017). Now we have thousands that are sitting on card debt they cant afford to pay back, cashing out at low points after buying near all time high.

Majority of stupid purchases can be returned or sold within next payment period. Crypto in other hand, is currency, even though its label says property. In the eyes of bank system, people are trading THEIR money for LESS of other's money; they're literally taking a loss whereas stupid tangible goods can be returned.
Just think about all those idiots that got into BITCONEEEEEECT. They're all in debt. Banks cant even wipe their asses with Bitconnect. See why they don't want to allow credit purchase?

To add onto we need to keep in mind that Japan is steps ahead of everyone in Crypto adoption; 10% of the population holds crypto.

That's a guy you don't want to follow. Sure, he's very rarely wrong, but hates to admit he's wrong and extreme with his opinions. Also shills his shit project, and anyone challeging the project is bashed with imaginary tech he pulls out of his ass.
Edit - person you're describing is Richard Heart

Another idiot that invests in complex tech that's still developing, but has zero basic knowledge of protocols. Do yourself a favor and stick with centralized system.
