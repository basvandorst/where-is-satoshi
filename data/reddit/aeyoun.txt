I lost the same account. Was verified but they kept stalling and found nonsensical reasons to reject the many withdrawal methods I added to my account.

It’s just the normal web. No extra effort for websites beyond what is involved in collecting payment (see the linked article).

As far as I can tell, this is just private-range use. I can’t find BitCoin anywhere in the current or upcoming Unicode standard.

Brave have an internal “Brave Wallet” (which is just a BitCoin address). You’re asked to transfer funds into your Brave Wallet to fund your monthly contribution. Payments to websites stop when you have no BTC left in your Brave Wallet.

Yet, the character Apple has implemented is in the private use range. So not a standard character. As I said, I can’t find any mention of a BitCoin character in any publication from the Unicode Consortium.

It has to start with someone, and that someone might as well be you. It just means the websites you frequent will be the early benefactors of Brave’s website-funding scheme.

That seems to match what I’m seeing in Brave, but I can’t tell for sure how this part of it works. What have you got against BitGo as a wallet provider? I can understand that Brave didn’t want a full BitCoin client will all the bandwidth and technical requirements that comes with that.

I believe Brave will focus on paying websites first, and then get back to their grand pay-the-user-to-browse idea.

I think you’re [absolutely right]( It’s already built, mostly, as a browser extension.
