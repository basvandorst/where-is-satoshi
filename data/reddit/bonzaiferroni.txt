* Bitcoin has too many investors and too few adopters. It is virtually worthless as a currency because too many people want to use it to get rich without actually doing anything. Marketplaces that accept bitcoin were never widespread and grow fewer in number every day. It has failed as a currency.
* It is completely unscalable. The amount of traffic that we saw during the november/december hype was a fraction of what we'd see if there was any meaningful adoption, and even then it was enough to make transaction fees and times skyrocket to the point that it collapsed under its own weight.
* The majority of the features of bitcoin are not valuable to the average consumer. Trustlessness is not valuable to most people. Even if it were, it is an empty promise. Trust-based relationships permeate the bitcoin ecosphere (mining pools, currency exchanges, wallet services, etc.). It makes the trustlessness inherent in blockchain moot.
Not that I know of another coin that is better. I think the first valuable cryptocurrency that sees wide adoption will be regulated and will have systems that discourage people using it as an investment scheme.

Is there a sub that discusses cryptocurrencies like reasonable people?

Thanks for the explanation, I was definitely missing that puzzle piece.

The thing is, this isn't a situation where you should expect people to just take your word for it.
Lets imagine a very similar situation except where the accused actually are guilty or are leaving out important information. How would we know the difference?
To put it very simply, you obviously have a conflict of interest. There needs to be some independent party, ideally a reputable newspaper, that can verify the details of your story and report it. If people don't believe you it isn't because they are callous or prejudiced, it is because they just have a healthy amount of skepticism.
If your story is true, it is important to tell. But it is also important to publish it in a way that a reasonable person can believe it. You know whether it is true. I hope you'll keep trying.

I don't think that is how a 51% attack works, but I'll confess I'm not technically savvy enough to explain why. It just doesn't fit with what I've read about the attacks. For example, [this article states](

You should probably not count on bitcoin in a scenario where governments are collapsing and economies are tanking. The things you can buy with bitcoin are very limited and that seems to be getting even worse. Also, the sheer amount of energy it takes to process transactions is barely sustainable when energy is plentiful, let alone when things start getting scarce.

What are the chances that the lightning network will solve bitcoins scalability issues? Unless it does, bitcoin is nothing more than a novelty. It will probably continue to grow in value and be useful as an investment option but I'm not sure it will ever take flight as a currency. It is actually losing progress towards that goal, fewer merchants are supporting it.

Thanks, I'm a bit unclear on how the difficulty adjusts.
Can someone help me understand why there is any added difficulty at all? During the last big boom there were some very long transaction times. Couldn't this have been alleviated by eliminating as much difficulty as possible?

Popular coverage is almost always going to be good for bitcoin unless it is very strongly recommending people avoid it. There are quite a few investors who still have a very vague idea what bitcoin is. Every time a broad audience gets more information it will attract new investors. 
I'm probably more skeptical about bitcoin than 99% of the people on this sub and even I would recommend having at least a small stake in it as part of a diverse portfolio. Multiply that by a bunch of new investors and it makes a difference.

Just curious, but how would you talk about this topic (bitcoin not performing as well as expected in the future) *without* it looking like "concern FUD"?
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:31:08
I don't think Bitcoin will ever recover its legitimacy as a practical currency. There are too many people who want to use it as an investment strategy, like a stock. This caused a huge bubble and massive fluctuations. Lots of online retailers [decided it was too risky to support]( This means that it is losing any actual value it had.
The worst thing that can happen to a cryptocurrency right now is for it to be hyped as the next bitcoin. The same thing will happen to it. These people need to stop huffing paint thinner and invest like a normal person. Let cryptocurrencies evolve without all the hype.

The video is also from 2014. Unfortunately the possibility of this attack hasn't just gone away, there are still mining pools that get dangerously close to a majority. There's not much the community can do except ask them not to.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:28:26
Wouldn't fewer miners also mean longer transaction times? At the same time there will be more people trying to use it in the scenario you describe.
@_date: 2018-02-25 05:17:35
I think he dismisses it a little too easily considering there have been mining pools that have [gotten up to 50%]( He also downplays the impact that a double spend would have. A successful attack would have a big impact on consumer confidence in bitcoin.
