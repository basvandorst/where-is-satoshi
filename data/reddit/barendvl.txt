Under "make a payment". Tldr in options, disable dynamic fees.

"Right now the PoW is a hash algorithm called SHA256. It's computationally quite simple, so miners build special chips called ASICs which do nothing but run SHA256 hashes billions of times per second."
"That can be 'fixed' by changing the PoW to something far more complex which requires a general purpose CPU or GPU to run (---and thus can't run on an ASIC---). Ethereum has done this with great success- their PoW requires a 1GB working dataset, and thus anyone with a gaming-class video card can mine"
I see this a lot here. 
EE engineer reporting in, I think this is a misconception. 
A GPU/CPU operated algo can always be 'ported' to digital circuitry specific to that algo, hence 'application-specific' IC. There is simply a development cost involved and I imagine the economics don't always work out depending on the coin market value (my guess).
So if the algo changes, miner companies could build new ASICs and drop their cost again. 
Maybe the solution lies in an adaptive algo which would need reconfigurable hardware to keep optimal performance? That would seem more difficult to build, although not impossible still. Then,  FPGAs might become a dominating hardware, still expensive and not as common as household PC.

GPS band is much lower frequency than this, your GPS receiver cannot handle this signal. In fact, today, no radio in your mobile phone can.

you're probably right. I guess it's all economics in the end. 
I wonder if analog processing could mean something here in any way. I r&amp;d analog circuits for a living and just recently started getting an interest in btc. any idea if anyone looked into this yet?
