It's a helium tank with self-tapping screws strapped around it with electrical tape.  Hardly an IED but certainly made to look like one.  Still fits the intent of invoking terror though.

You have to imagine that university students would be smarter than this and would come up with something that actually works, when they have such a wealth of information available to them.  
I'm thinking it was staged to look like the students made it, by someone who does not revere them as intelligent and would love for the rest of the world to see the protesters in that light too.  Sound like any organizations you've heard of?

I just heard a lot of talk about Jupiter on squawk alley during lunch, leading to a very confusing but educational break, mucking about through all this trend prediction, WSB bullshitting, and straight up autism. Hard to tell what's what anymore.

I'm a data man, you see?
Bits come in, they dont know where they came from, they get lost.  But if I have a record of where you bits have been, and you have a record of where your bits have been, and my record is tauted as more reputable and is corroborated by a dozen unknown entities identical to myself, then I KNOW WHERE YOUR BITS HAVE BEEN.
