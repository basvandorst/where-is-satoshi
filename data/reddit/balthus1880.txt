She seemed to be a CEO of a BTC related company. Very cold response to a suicide. Have a little compassion.

Every time I dropped below $550 I was buying .1BTC but I got scared after a while and considered $500 a safe play. Go BTC Go!

Still dropping. I think the people are slowly finding out this latest news. The china thing was huge. Is Bloomberg news reporting it yet ?

I like your enthusiasm but didn't this dude break some laws? Like orchestrating drug sales and maybe an assassination or two...I could be wrong but in my eyes silk road was cool, but certainly not a legal US business.

How cheap? I got in after the China bubble at $550. It's just went from $612 to $607....money grabbers

To confirm, was there a public announcement that no one applied to claim the property?

Here's where we totally agree. I acquired BTC to spend BTC. It is an investment vehicle for sure BUT, the only way for it to increase in value is to spend it and have it used as a commodity. I am willing to move my hard earned cash into a new type of currency. As volatile as it is I have faith that this is a way to spark a revolution on some level.

I have been looking at it since it was at around $100 and wanted to get involved. He was the first person to make it feel like it was accessible and safe. I have been doing research and I am confident in BTCs ability to legitimize itself over the next 5-10 years.

A few factors. The idea that someone is forming an ETF based around BTC was a very legitimizing factor.
He recommended a website (CoinBase) that I found very stable and easy to navigate. 
I have been watching BTC since it was at $100 but never knew how to get involved. The BTC community is very tech-heavy and leans on scaring people to not invest what they can't afford. I just won my fantasy football league and had $500 to invest.
The ability for BTC to continue to rebound and grow and the idea that my money can grow in a non-traditional investment vehicle was very interesting to me.

you re famous on [twitter](

I found CoinBase to be really easy to use, and again. As much as I bet the BTC community hates it the Winklevoss guy dropping the name made me confident to at least take the initial plunge into BTC. I am doing tons of research and reading everyday but it's a very complex and technical thing and intimidating for a lot of people

Ah ok. Well I salute your diligence. I think his status as a venture capitalist legitimized BTC for me. I hope you are still holding your BTC and not getting out completely
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:04:55
here here. i am on board with ya! I bought my first coin in the crash because i saw an opportunity to be a part of something bigger than my shitty TDameritrade account. I am heading to europe in a week and am pumped to try and spend some coin!

That's too bad. Why are you hanging out in BTC/new out of curiosity? If your interest is dead this is a weird place on reddit to be hanging out.
