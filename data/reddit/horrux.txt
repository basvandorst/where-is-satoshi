Nobody knows for sure. There are reasonongs about it but in reality nobody knows for sure.
I remember in the 1990s there was a company here in Canada called Northern Telecom, which changed its name to Nortel (ticker NT). Of course it was when the Internet took off and they were a prime supplier of that kind of telecom equipment, so their stock took off.
But I, as a stock broker back then, wasn't comfortable with the stock. I didn't like it. I didn't know why, because it looked like it was doing FANTASTIC. One day when the stock is well above $100 I start going back on the chart, years back, and discover a gap at something like $1.20.
Of course it seemed farfetched that the street's darling would lose 90% of its value. Everyone was optimistic about it.
I had a client who had $20,000,000 in that, out of $22,000,000 in assets. I urged him to sell a quarter of his position with all urgency and insistence. He ignored me, stating that the CEO told him personally that the stock was going to hit $160. And I knew one thing: when the CEO becomes a predictor of the stock price: SELL!!
About a year later it went from $130 or so to like $3.00 or so, and kept going down from there, eventually closing that gap.
Lesson for everyone: DO NOT EVER IGNORE A GAP IN THE CHART!!!!!

I could feel it, but this... Well, Plan B's regression just nails it. It's BEAUTIFUL, BRILLIANT, PERFECT.
Yep, BTC is digital gold: unalterable, scarce, easily exchangeable. It isn't fungible but then again gold isn't really, unless you melt your bars and remove the markings. Which is certainly POSSIBLE but makes it much less easy to trade then.

Scarcity, immutability and liquidity, on top of being fully VIRTUAL and DISTRIBUTED gives BTC (and other cryptos) all the characteristics of the ideal money of the 21st century.
Now certainly BTC as "money" is not PERFECT. Transaction confirmation delays and fees see to that. But it doesn't need to be perfect. You can have multiple cryptocurrencies each specialized in what they do best. For bitcoin, that is STORE OF VALUE. Why? BECAUSE! 
Yes, that's as good a reason as any! If people accept it as a SoV, then it is! Simple as that! Gold as a SoV has basically the same reasoning behind it: it's scarce and immutable, and that is (probably?) why people accepted it as a store of value. But the fact is, THEY DO. And that's sufficient.
Time will prove me right in saying it is the absolute same with BTC.

The issuer largely takes NO risk. How much risk is there on their part on the average mortgage? 
Let's see, we're lending you digits inside a computer, and we're taking YOUR HOME as a guarantee. So very risky, so we're going to charge you 8% because prime is at 0.5% and we're nice like that.

According to my calculations, BTC is actually worth $400,000 right now. But the value of government fiat currencies is in free-fall at the moment, so it's hard to peg a given value.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:13:03
Nah, it's been manipulated down hugely so that the 1% can load up at bargain basement prices.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:17:14
Remember that a good chunk of that is going to pushing down the price of BTC, gold and silver, in order to keep the illusion that the currency is NOT losing its value. Other central banks are doing the same of course. They are all ONE organization after all.
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:26:10
It's amazing, impressive and depressing how few people even on these supposedly 'smart' subs understand this reality.

@_date: 2019-12-17 01:12:49
By selling it short. Look up "short selling". You've probably seen ads promising you a return for just depositing your cryptos in an account. That's because you are essentially LENDING them to third parties who then sell them short (sell them without owning them). So basically if you deposit cryptos in such accounts, you are helping drive the price down.
Most of the manipulation is done by institutions using derivatives (look up futures and options).
Some people think that the fact that futures are settled in cash rather than delivering cryptocurrencies means these contracts can't be used to influence the price of the underlying cryptocurrency. But they are 100% wrong. I have explained this a few times on this and other subs.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:18:33
It's being manipulated down so the 1% can buy essentially all of it.
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:22:46
Do what. Manipulate it? Are  you kidding?
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:11:44
Given that the price is manipulated by those who want to prevent and slow down the spread of BTC, that is very unsurprising. It will remain thus until the next financial crisis. I predict one in 2020.

I am well, not an expert on cryptos, but an expert on economics and financial markets.
I agree with the logic but the price of BTC is completely fixed and manipulated at the moment. It is not anywhere NEAR where the market sees its value being.
Wait, but the price is MADE by the market, right? Well yeah... What I'm saying is that there is huge intervention on the market to "adjust" the price of BTC (among others) to a level that is politically more convenient than the simple market reality.
It's become that important. Sadly.
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:11:10
Which is why the price is decided by the financial powers at the political level. There are basically no other significant market factors at play.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:39:14
Yep! Just going with logic but I agree, it all looks pretty bleak.
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:02:33
Regulating is one thing, manipulating the market price, now that's pretty out there compared to what most people think governments are about.
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:38:42
Well the "US goverment" may be broke, but the Fed is printing money like madness, and using that to short BTC, gold and silver, among other things. This price manipulation makes it appear as though the USD is retaining its value, but it really is not. At some point, the USD will be marked to reality and its purchasing power will be nearly nil.
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:00:34
There are TA methods that allow some fairly accurate ways to identify dips and also when the dip seems to be done dipping in the immediate.
This, however, has not translated over to BTC for example. Saddens me a bit, that.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:54:37
That's what the repo market \*IS\*. It's banks lending (mostly other banks) money overnight on deposit of "risk-free" securities such as treasury bills. The next day, or the day after that, etc. the treasuries are repo'ed (repurchased) from the lender by the lendee.
That banks are less willing to engage in these operations is a strange phenomenon. It seems to mean there either isn't enough cash (but the money supply is at an all-time high) or that banks are unwilling to lend on treasuries. That could mean two things: the banks are wanting to hold on to their cash no matter what (well with negative interest rates on the curve, cash is better than many securities) or that the US government is about to default on its debt.
Both indicate that the market feels interest rates are too low and need to move higher. But higher rates when there is economic concern, that is usually the worst idea...
@_date: 2019-09-30 16:46:07
You mean PRIVATIZED USD not "nationalized".
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:44:52
The price is completely manipulated. Bitcoin needs to move up to about $400k.
But when? When the biggest of all players decide it's time to let it do what the market dictates. Until then, the price will be whatever THEY decide.

With a 1050ti, if your power is cheap, there \*ARE\* coins you can actually mine with some profitability. However, Bitcoin is the most demanding in terms of required hash rate and even if your power were free, it still wouldn't make sense to mine it with \*ANY\* video card.

Wow, quoting Ace of Bass from the early 90s? Pretty cryptic if you ask me.
@_date: 2019-09-26 20:16:34
Well they've been price fixing BTC (as well as gold, silver and likely other cryptos but those sorta follow BTC anyway) so as to give the illusion that state fiat currencies are not in the very quick and advanced process of losing what purchasing power they had left.

Yes, of note is the Grin coin, which supposedly implements everything needed for QC resistance.
However, due to QC being in its infancy, I bet some adjustments might be required at some point down the line.
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:04:12
Yes, but the TA I speak of is made so that specifically such shocks to the price are taken into account as a rare event. But what's viable in the stock market isn't in BTC. Especially that the Fed dictates the price it decides BTC is going to trade at.
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:48:07
It isn't that, per se...
If you look at the money supply in the USA and yes, worldwide in developed economies. The amount of "money" in circulation has at least tripled over the last few years. Normally, you triple the money supply and what? Prices triple! Purchasing power of a single unit of currency is slashed by 2/3rd. Maybe not instantly. Maybe not exactly. But it's pretty much a certainty and exactly what happens. Every single time.
Except, well... THIS TIME. How come?
The only way for prices and therefore "the value of currency" to remain the same in such a situation is if a PERFECT ILLUSION that the currency is retaining its value. But how you ask? Well...
 1 ) By manipulating the calculations for inflation so as to hide it... DONE.
 2) By manipulating the value of assets, especially the "flight to safety" ones, such as gold and silver... DONE.
 3) Well what about crypto? Yes, Bitcoin has been more and more looked at as an alternative, digital "flight to safety" asset, since like gold it is rare and unalterable, on top of being DIGITAL.
How is this done, you ask? By using FUTURES. A future is a way to lock in a price on an asset for a duration of time. Say you own BTC and you think their value is in jeopardy for the next 6 months. You can short a future on BTC for the amount you own. This effectively "locks in" the current price of your BTC for you. So if BTC loses you say $100,000 in value, your short BTC future position will increase in value by the same amount. Pretty handy, neh? 
But what's this got to do with manipulating its price, you ask?
Well, the behind-the-scenes workings of the futures markets are some fairly well kept secrets. Here goes: 
When you sell (short) a future, somebody has to buy it (long). If there is a guy betting the price of BTC is moving up and is gambling with futures, he might pick them up naked long. That means he's got the cash and he's going long the future, betting it'll increase in value. But many a time there isn't such a dude looking to gamble like that. 
So how do you short a future when there aren't investors wanting to go long? Well these markets are made by... Bear with me, Market Makers. These guys usually work for a big bank or investment dealer. It is their job to well, "make a market", that is, to be ready to short (offer) the futures for those who want to go long and to be ready to go long themselves if there are more players looking to go short. So there is always a market.
Say somebody cough, (((the FED))) cough, wants the price of BTC to NOT reflect the destitute state of the US dollar. They will short the hell out of the BTC future. The market-maker has to go long. But that's not comfortable, to be naked long a futures contract on an asset that you may very well not actually want. So the market-maker actually sells short the actual BTC in order to be in a market-neutral position. Long the future, short the asset, it's a risk-free position.
So. They can and \*DO\* manipulate the value of gold, silver, BTC and perhaps other cryptos in order to maintain the illusion that the USD isn't losing most of what remains of its value, when in fact it is eaten away already, but it's not priced accordingly. Wait, what about other major currencies? 
THEY ARE ALL DOING THE SAME THING.
WHAT??? WHY???
Because all central banks are essentially ONE ORGANIZATION and they are a private organization whose goal is to plunder the worlds' economies. And they are almost done doing that by now. Once they are, they will likely stop lending, let the currencies mark to actual value (pretty much zero) and let the world burn in civil war, mass starvation, etc. I don't know when THAT part happens. It could be another 20 years for all I know.
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:41:37

@_date: 2019-09-27 02:42:04
Some people who probably know the question much better than myself believe it might be possible to fix BTC's fees and transaction delays.
As a store of value however, I disagree with you. I think BTC will succeed on that front and superbly at that. I am also not alone in believing this.
As for the third, the world's fiat currencies are on the brink of self-annihilation. Cryptos are the obvious choice for an alternative. Will it be many cryptos, just a few, who the hell knows. What *I* know, as an economist, is that there *ARE* no other options. I mean I suppopse somebody somewhere might come up with something. But right now, Cryptos or nothing. Well, gold and metals but we live in a digital age...

Economically, it is best when each nation has its own currency. Then the value of that currency can reflect the commercial, economic, financial, social, etc. status and evolution of the nation. Because of this, the Euro is a calamity. Having one currency for many nations does not help anything. It makes everything worse.
