Not sure how this is related to BTC... but fuck the Pats. From one bird (Seattle) to another. Go birds!

I have been watching too much fantasy.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:20:59
Wow. Thank you for clearing that up. I was worried about losing my funds if I sent it to a none SegWit address.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:50:56
If you're really worried, just transfer everything into a paper wallet until the stand alone is out. But  mentioned that it will be out in weeks. Relax and HODL

If you do mine, start looking into altcoins. Those are on the rise. Check out Intensecoin (ITNS) a VPN coin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:01:22
Amen brother.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:48:16
It has ads. It is better to just get adblocker and run it on Chrome or Mozilla.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:02:09
I'm pretty sure this is a scam. I cannot find any of the team members anywhere. Real photos with fake general names.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:57:39
After entering in your portfolio and you've lost some. Is it best to report that right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:22:45
Yeah I agree. I am also doing the same
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:22:36
Yeah I agree. Once you plan for the long term I say get it. Do not buy from Amazon. Just buy it straight from the company's website itself.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:42:39
I had the same question about Hashflare but I am seeing profit results with Genesis Mining.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:50:16
Check out Bitflyer. It is a Japanese company but based in San Francisco, CA. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:26:57
Late to the party but at least you're here!
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:22:08
Yeah I still got mine... those were the days
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:10:47
Hardware wallet. Get it. Ledger Nano S or Trezor. I only played around with the Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:40:37
Just go straight to the source. It pays to be safe.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:05:15
One thing I do not like about Binance is that when you want to trade, you cannot send all your crypto for another. Even if you hit the "100%" button, you will still have leftovers in your wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-15 02:00:13
I don’t think so. This is why it’s for long time customers or so.
@_date: 2019-06-14 01:13:54
It’s under your profile. When you are normally trying to withdraw there is an option.
@_date: 2019-06-14 01:33:46
Check it out.

Go transfer your Coinbase funds into your Dgax account. Its owned by Coinbase. Withdraw your funds from Gdax. Avoid those fees.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:29:36
1broker.com is a good one
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:52
I am having the same debate with myself between the two wallets. Ledger or Trezor.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:52:50
I agree. Nothing wrong has happened to the BTC and LTC I have bought.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:22:27
You should look into Gdax. It owned by Coinbase. I haven't ran into that problem when using Coinbase or Gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:26:11
I have Exodus. I just click on the send button and look at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:18:56
check out this podcast.
The dev talks about airbitz wallet. Airbitz will die out in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:35:42
HAHAHAAH 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:37:38
Ahh I see. Didn't know that. Thanks for that
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:48:41
I used blockchain for my trip to Japan. For two weeks it was fine as a mobile app. Once I got home, I invested in a hardware wallet (Ledger Nano S).
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:10:32
Here us a blockchain site
I haven't used this one yet but should be good.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:59:18
I would just sign up for Gemini or the exchange in your country and use that if you need to sell quick.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:01:13
You can either buy an ASIC and a location with cheap electricity or go into Genesis Mining (cloud mining).
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:20:35
Hahaha yeah I saw this last night. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:04:36
You still have it. I would recommend not leaving it on any exchanges like Coinbase. If you get your receive address you can look it up on the block explorer. You can also put in a ticket with them and show them the proof but it depends on how busy Coinbase is
