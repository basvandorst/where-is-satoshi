I'm not even a Maximalist. But if you're just starting, and don't understand what you're buying. For the love of god, just buy Bitcoin. Research, learn, buy whatever you want from there. If you treat the crypto market like a casino, it will treat you like a gambler.

It's not like I even have anything against XRP. I just don't understand it. And yet price can pump and if you sell at the right time, you can make a bunch of money. Same for picking the right number at the roulette wheel. People should be able to buy and spend however they want. It just frustrates me that people think it's all the same and it's all a magic money making machine. It's a high risk commodity that is (hopefully) a hedge to the standard financial ecosystem.
Bitcoin is a great investment. You must consider the high risk nature of Bitcoin itself, much less other crypto. We're not even sure PoW will produce good incentives at a large scale. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF BITCOIN WILL WORK IN THE LONG RUN. As always, Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin.

I’ve told everyone, many of which are not interested at all, some of which are strangers in line at the store. I convince ONE friend to buy Bitcoin. He gets a CB account and buys XRP, cause it’s cheaper *facepalm*

She can afford ANYTHING ��. You can buy $0.000001 of Bitcoin if you want. Not sure why that concept is so difficult. It’s like saying “I can’t afford to buy dollars right now, they’re too expensive”.

Never really thought about it this way. No one is saying their secure, they’re saying they’re secure enough. If you’re selling a car you might want at least one, selling a drink you can just trust that your customer isn’t trying to actively scam you.
For that matter replace by fee isn’t a big deal either, given the same scenario.

You don’t need their approval one little tiny bit. You need CONSENSUS! If you created a better solution with better code you might get adoption. Bitcoin Core just cooks the food, everyone else decides if they want to eat it. They control a repo of source controlled open source software, that’s it that’s all. Everything else is up to the miners, full nodes, exchanges and wallets.
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:28:07
I’m not. As long as the main network remains decentralized. You can always invent a competing second layer. I’ve always thought Coinbase to Coinbase transactions should be free. That’s totally centralized, but I’m ok with that, as long as I have the option. Personally, I think it’s about choice, you just have to pay for the properties you want from your transaction. On chain: slow, expensive, how you purchase lambos and islands, second layer: coffee. The main chain is too valuable a resource to use for things that don’t need censorship resistance.
I don’t believe you can have everything packed into one layer. Lots of people smarter than me on both sides. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:05:19
No worries about centralization?
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:07:30
For what purpose? A decentralized censorship resistance form of value transfer. Or just a form of value transfer?
@_date: 2019-03-29 04:20:54
Computer, paper, phone or hardware wallet.
You can’t spend from a paper wallet, so it’s a little inconvenient. But you can print several key pairs and spread your value across multiple, loading only what you need into a hot wallet when you need it. Be careful what site you print them from, be sure it’s a reputable Bitcoin site.
Computers have a large attack surface and are hard to secure in general. This would be my last choice (with the exception of the glacier protocol).
Phones are a good choice but, store your seed phrase with PEN AND PAPER and keep it in a safe place. If you loose your phone you can still have access you your coins as long as you have your seed. Also, I personally, would not keep more than a few hundred dollars in it, just my personal preference.
Hardware wallets are the ideal choice, as long as you get them from the manufacture themselves. DO NOT BUY A USED HARDWARE WALLET. I prefer the Trezor, but I know many people that are very happy with the ledger products. It KILLED me to not use the money to buy more Bitcoin, but it was worth it in the long run.
Hope this helps :-)

Part of the Bitcoin ethos is not involving third parties, or at least not having to trust them. By keeping Bitcoin on an exchange you must trust the exchange to hold your value. Imagine if everyone kept their Bitcoin on exchanges and just moved value between accounts on those exchanges. This would not be much different than the banking system we have today. We wouldn’t need a blockchain, just a database synced across the exchanges in the ecosystem. This is a much faster and efficient way of transferring value, but that value is contingent upon trusting the entities holding it. Several exchanges have already disappeared with all the assets of their (former) users.
It’s fair to say that your value is relatively safe on some of the more reputable platforms. But there’s nothing like holding your own hardware wallet in your own hands. It’s an enlightening experience to add funds to a QR code on a piece of paper. Doing this as a community we can ensure exchanges are not telling people they have more assets than they actually do.
Be careful though, if you’re unsure how it works or how to store it yourself, do some searching first. DYOR!
You are responsible for keeping it safe, don’t let anyone tell you what to do with it (even if they are mostly right).

Reconsider for such a large amount. If you really don’t want to deal with holding you own keys, consider Coinbase vault (slightly more secure). Also, start researching hardware wallets. They really aren’t that complicated, and as long as you have your seed phrase you’ll never lose your coins. Get a wallet and start small, even having just $1 in the wallet to get comfortable with the process. Trusting a 3rd party is fine, but it’s nice when you don’t have to. There’s a weird feeling you get when you have that hardware wallet in your hand and you know there’s nothing between you and the rest of the world.
MtGox is an old school example, you’re right, if Robinhood collapsed it would wreck a lot of people, but Bitcoin would recover and you might not.
There’s a time and place for counter party risk. Every individual has a different limit and needs to make their own decision.
There’s no counter party risk to an ATM, removing that risk was (IMO) the point of blockchain. That’s not to say people can’t gain from others seeing the value of that.
Congratulations and good luck.

Holding an asset over time (and taking on risk) is how you get rich. Not sure how else you'd do it (using Bitcoin)?
@_date: 2019-08-02 11:19:27
You, my friend, are in the good company of many, many people. Everyone was calling for 8500, like, everyone. GBTC wicked down and filled the gap, no one got their orders filled (except those trading GBTC). Don’t beat yourself up too much.

Remember what it was like when you were new and the price went up a bunch the first time? You were the only one you knew that had any, maybe the only one that even knew about Bitcoin. You feel like you’re in a secret club of super smart people, and you’re one of them. You are correct, it’s cringy, but I remember feeling that way about Bitcoin, and if I’m being honest, I still do sometimes.
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:34:04
One problem is that Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. A house can always be taken by someone to repay your loan. Would you be willing to have the lender hold your keys? If you were a lender would you give someone a pile of money, and if they default, they pinky swear to sell the Bitcoin to pay it back?
You could, if you had 2 BTC, sell one, then leverage buy at 2x ��
@_date: 2019-10-02 13:35:21
Interesting choice of words. I'm guessing it was due to some people thinking it was a rubber bullet. Unfortunately, the word "shot" has lost it's impact in the world today. "He only got shot, well, who hasn't been shot, tell him to suck it up"

RBF only allows you to change the fee, not the destination or amount. So, RBF would not work for this use.

At this point the only real way to claim the title is to sign something with the genesis block key. Even if they/he/she was them/him/her, if they don’t have the keys, they will never be able to prove it. If they can’t do that, the identity will forever be lost as those keys.

If you’re a regular, the store wouldn’t really have to worry about a double spend. They wouldn’t even have to wait for a confirmation.

I hate “this” comments ... but THIS! I’ve not had the time to setup a LN node, and not sure I I want to bother. But BlueWallet lets me experience and use LN without all the overhead. LN redefines cheap and fast. For anyone wanting to try it out, please don’t put more value in the wallet than you might spend in a week. If you’re just playing around it shouldn’t be more than ~200k sats.

Did a little research, you are correct. You’ve got to go to the command line to do it, but it’s totally possible by the protocol. Sorry about that. Learn something new every day ��‍♂️

NONE OF THIS IS PEER-TO-PEER! It’s a broadcast network. Whew, sorry, just bugs me.

What if we could have all that and almost 0 fee, instant transactions. The lightning network is live, and it’s mind blowing. Banks will run federated side chains with rollbacks, insured transactions, customer service, etc.
There’s nothing you can do with fiat that you can’t do with Bitcoin. The individual will choose the level of security they want depending on the transaction.
Maybe... ��

I’m a little confused. If I hand you a dollar bill, you don’t need me to fill out a form. Is there some value limit?

Value being your percent ownership of the total supply.
