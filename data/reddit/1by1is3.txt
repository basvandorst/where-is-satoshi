It's called gold
And before you say 'oh but they are still mining gold', yeah, they are still mining bitcoin too.

 Those countries will be the first to ban crytocurrencies, because ''it's easy to send worldwide''. The untaxed black money is all going to go offshore through bitcoin if they don't ban it and the local fiat currencies will be pushed into a collapse even more. This is why developing countries have capital controls.

I don't know what you are smoking when you are claiming that I can buy more with bitcoin than gold. That's hilarious.

Sure but life does not work in hypotheticals. Fixed supply system is a sound system, but people and their emotions are not stable. People will buy and people will sell irrationally and a currency needs to be flexible enough to allow for that. Otherwise gold is better than bitcoin.

Dude, firstly crypto is not making difference between life and death on any major scale. Secondly, the countries in question do not really care about being regarded as oppressive.

Debasement is as form of tax, and if you believe taxation is theft, then I won't argue with you. Economists have studied what makes a good currency, and more often than not, results show that a good currency is STABLE in value and that people are not afraid to spend it. Stable does not mean not losing value stable means that transactions can happen in that currency without second thoughts about the currency being used, by its users. Bitcoin has not reached that level yet, and I don't know if it ever will.

Speaking of hypothetical scenarios then, [a simple magnetic field burst can wipe out bitcoin from existence](
Nothing is wiping off gold from this planet

I can buy a lot of things with gold. I can't buy anything much with bitcoin


No restaurant will deny it if gold is legit.

Gold is bad currency? lol 8,000 year old universal acceptance is not enough for you? I think bitcoin needs to go 8000 years uninterrupted to come close to gold's status. Currently you can't buy much with bitcoin.

I will be buying when price hits below $1,000
I was hoping that would be this summer but at this rate we could be there by next week

You don't have to believe in any studies, just look at this reddit group. People are constantly telling others to ''HODL'' what is intended to be a currency. You don't ''hodl'' currency because it could make you rich (i.e. rich in USD) which is all what everyone cares about here. Do people measure bitcoin here by how many goods it can buy? No. People look at it's price in USD. That's all you need to figure out which one of USD or Bitcoin is a currency. 
And if you believe mega multi billion dollar projects that drive the modern economy are even possible without governments, then I have a bridge to sell you.
