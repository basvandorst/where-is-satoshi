1) those numbers are cleaner and easier to interpret 
2) you don't have to manage other people's numbers when making a payment. You simply use your own to send money from. And if you make a mistake it doesn't work. It's significantly different from sending to another number that is not your own and is irreversible.

That's interesting. I'd like to learn more. In the US these things are pretty automated.

There also needs to be a better infrastructure for making payment easy. Copy/pasting a seemingly random string of characters and numbers to send money to someone they probably don't know is something most people will be hesitant to do.

No need to apologize. I believe it's the future as well. I was just saying that the sooner it gets easier to use, the sooner you'll see more adoption and application.

You don't know me. And you don't know what you're talking about. It was a small percentage of wealthy people who were using the internet before the late 90s.

Again, you don't know me. And the last time I checked 11.65% was far from a majority. I remember America being a pretty wealthy country in 1994 as well. If 9/10 American households didn't have internet access, then it's pretty safe to say the internet was used by a small percentage of wealthy people at that time.

I remember it and I don't remember it being very complicated. My memory is that there was an application on your desktop that pretty much automated the entire sign-on process as well as consolidated your email, instant message, web-browsing, etc.

How often do you pay for things by sending money to their bank account number? I was more referring to purchasing something online. There's usually an (imperfect) infrastructure that exists now where we can simply click a button, pay the appropriate recipient, and our order is placed. 
For crypto, that process is generally still pretty manual. Fortunately I think that's one of the easier things to develop, it's just not fully adopted yet.

So if you can be taxed on the Bitcoin you sell as capital gains, can you get a deduction for the crypto you've bought if it decreases in value?

It's an exchange coin. Their ICO was last year and they offer zero-fee trading on their exchange.

This graphic explains how the coins get from Alice's address to Bob's, but how does Bob verify that he was in fact paid by Alice? Does he need to create a new address for every purchase order that is made?
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:56:52
Right but how is he supposed to know which address belonged to which person. The blockchain doesn't say that. Just simply which address moved how much to which address and when. They would need to include more information somewhere.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:30:08
Yeah I imagine it would also help to have a separate address for each transaction because if he has two orders placed for the same value and only gets paid for one of them, he would need a way to identify who has paid and who hasn't. That or Alice provides her sending address at the time she places her order.

The point is the word "required"
