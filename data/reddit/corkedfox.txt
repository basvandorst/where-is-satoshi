30 day transition.  And if you think it might take longer than 30 days then you're anti-Bitcoin.  Good times.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:45:39
It's a fee market. Users are free to bid as efficiently or inefficiently as they want. If you don't like the rules, complain to the developers who made the rules.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:40:49
Is this now the important graph?  Last week everyone said [this graph is worthless]( and you have to look at the witness size (10%).  Which graph is the important graph, or is it just whichever one is higher at the moment?
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:19:38
Right.  The key is that all of today's nodes will be able to interact with all future versions of LN.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:46:29
Pre-Segwit you would have been called anti-Bitcoin if you thought it would take longer than a month to adopt Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:56:56


Can someone explain how this will guarantee confirmation? Sounds like an empty promise to me.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:20:31
3 months ago: Software upgrades shouldn't be rushed.  They need at least 1-2 years of testing before deploying.
Now: It's been 3 months, why hasn't Coinbase rushed out a software upgrade?

LN has a $600 transaction limit. Max funding for a channel is $2400. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:33:33
Was lightning always on your list of demands or are you just continuously moving the goalposts?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:16:43
Just keep in mind that the max payment is $600 and your channel can't hold more than $2400. This spec was original set to $10/$40 but the price of Bitcoin has grown since then.
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:13:14
This needs to be its own sticky post. LN development only began in August, so we need to give it time.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:59:03


This isn't a user set limit.  This is a limit built into the software spec.  Are you suggesting that users should begin tinkering with their limits?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:37:22
Potential yes. It only becomes economically sane as you approach the channel size limit of $2400. That gives you a 1% fee to open. It's not smart to fund it with small amounts like $200 (10% fee). So that gives you your price of entry if you want to use LN.
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:04:25
Thanks for poking your head in here.  Can you give us some quick insight on when the transaction/channel size limit will be removed?  Will it be removed in the lnd mainnet beta?
I'm worried that it will become a permanent feature of LN.
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:43:02
Calm down there skippy.  Core isn't releasing their implementation until May, and even Core devs are warning for people to not adopt Segwit until LN is ready.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:47:29


Then I must be mistaken. I must have misread the spec. Can I use you as a source to prove that channel limits are a myth?
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:49:06
This thread is about Coinbase spamming the mempool and raising fees for non-Coinbase users.
If you don't like Coinbase's internal fees, why haven't you swapped to another exchange with cheaper fees? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:02:05
Yes, why would the developers artificially keep it low? It's only a simple change that will make the updated clients incompatible with prior clients.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:37:10
Your refill example is an 800 bit on-chain transaction when fees are around 1200 bits.  That's a hell of a premium to use LN.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:54:39
Remember when it was malicious to warn that Segwit adoption would take longer than 1 month?
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:00:07
Are high fees a problem that should be addressed?  I was under the impression that high fees are good.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:01:45
Oh you're only looking at confirmed transactions?  Those are capped at the blocksize so not really a good indicator of transaction demand.  Maybe you can explain why you think confirmed transactions indicate total market demand?
I'm looking at the rate of transactions added to mempool:
We're down to about half of our peak from mid December.  I think this shows that demand is currently lower.  I don't think batching can make up for this deficit.  Your outputs/transaction plot shows an increase from 2.7 in mid December to 3.2 today.  That's an increase in batching.  Does it make up for the halving in transaction demand?  My math says no, but you're saying yes.  Feel free to explain further.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:19:41
A few blocks and a 144 block moving average.  In about 12 hours (2200 UTC) that line will suddenly snap back to 8%.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:28:11
That's great news.  I'm glad to hear that today's LN software will be compatible with all future versions.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:37:23
Just keep in mind that max channel size is $2000.  So keep your spending under $6000.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:09:43


The 1-2 years is the amount of time I suggested giving Coinbase to develop.  I didn't say they began development 1-2 years ago (quote me if I did).  I'm saying that they deserve the same 1-2 years development time from their start date (sometime between August and today).
So let's say you're arguing that they started late.  Fine, hold them to a schedule where they started in August.  That means August 2018 is the earliest you should expect a release.  It isn't August 2018 yet, but here you are outraged that their software development isn't finished 5 months later.  If you think that 5 months is worthy of outrage, feel free to argue that software developments should take 3 months or whatever your company's project schedules look like.  As a developer, does your company hold you to 3 month project schedules?
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:43:04
Can you point to the source that shows that transactions (including batched) are up?
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:31:09


So what's wrong with Coinbase taking a little extra time to minimize bugs to minimize the chance of destroying their entire company?  My 1-2 years came from 2x.  2x was viewed as a rushed development since increasing blocksize would take 1-2 years to develop and debug.  The last thing you want to do is dump a buggy upgrade onto the Bitcoin network, which is what happened and failed gloriously.  What happened to that logic from just 3 months ago?  What is wrong with conservative software development schedules?
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:10:02


You really seem to misunderstand things.  A month ago they said that [Segwit is coming in 2018](  Do you have a source where they said they aren't working on it?
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:11:19
Agreed, we need to shame all exchanges that don't support bech32. Does anyone have a list of exchanges that support bech32?

The link says 145gb of hard drive space. Is this correct?
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:06:21
Especially since channels are limited to $2000.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:34:46
Agreed. All exchanges and wallets without full bech32 integration must be shamed. Do you have a list?
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:28:25
Oh that's reassuring.  I was under the impression that upgraded unlimited nodes will not be able to send across the current network.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:24:56
From the developer of LN:


@_date: 2018-01-29 03:50:00
So you're saying that Segwit adoption is unmeasurable?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:49:31
So the spam never shows up in the mempool for any miner to take?
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:05:53
So you disagree with the developers on this issue?
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:00:47
Meanwhile all the LN threads are filled with posts saying that LN is ready to use on main.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:24:03
Follow the thread.  I said that Coinbase is currently working on it.  Glurp claimed that Coinbase isn't currently working on it.  I get that you are so mad and full of outrage, but that doesn't mean you should start making up facts to suit your narrative.  Coinbase is working on implementing Segwit and batching.  This is a good thing.  If you're convinced that Coinbase isn't working on Segwit and batching then I think you've become too addicted to being outraged, and it's blinding you from the truth.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:47:24
You connect to a central hub and all transactions go through it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:04:12
Yes exactly.  It's like how Bcash is 8MB blocks and completely incompatible with the Bitcoin network.  At any moment we can fork LN to increase the limit, but that new software won't be compatible with today's network.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:56:11
Can someone explain? I'm guessing that we're looking at green because it's 10mb. What's confusing me is that none of green made it into a block. Doesn't that mean that the fee wasn't enough?
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:58:45
Just last week you were encouraging random reddit users to use LN on main. Unbelievable how reckless everyone is behaving just so they can say that LN is launched and ready for use. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:31:33
No. Channels are limited to 0.17 BTC. Transactions limited to .04 BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:08:49
This is true.  Block size is limited to 1MB.  If we allowed any bigger blocks then nodes would become too expensive to run and Bitcoin would become more centralized.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:42:14
Yes it could in the future. But we're talking about why the mempool is clearing today. It's clearing today from decreased usage, not from Coinbase adding batching.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:45:09
Because 200sat is still not guaranteed for quick confirmation. There's plenty of competition for next block even if occasionally we nibble at 5-10. Zoom in and check for yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:31:21
Now we have a direct conflict of interests.  We have these companies and users wanting lower fees and we have [the developers wanting higher fees](  The developers are "winning" but at what cost?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:40:44


Go to [the spec](  Search for amount_msat. 


The variable spec is 8 bytes, which was put in place because this spec applies to both Bitcoin and Litecoin.  8 bytes is for Litecoin.  The 5th hit for amount_msat is this line:


If Bitcoin, set 4 of those 8 bytes to 0, effectively making it a 4 byte variable.  A 4 byte unsigned integer goes from 0 to 4294967295.  This value is in millisatoshi.  Move the decimal place 11 spots to get Bitcoin.  0.04294967295.  $624 at time of writing.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:07:42
Exactly, the devs have been pleading with the community to not use it on mainnet.  You're on the side fighting against the devs.  Take a step back and evaluate if that's really the stance you wish to take.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:51:43
Meanwhile 0.16 is scheduled for May release.  Is that worthy of the same outrage?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:02:49


Yes that's my understanding as well.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:59:33
Agreed.  It's setting up to be another scaling debate similar to 1MB, and it'll get harder and harder to gain consensus as the network grows.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:38:47
Right, everyone will connect to a hub to increase chances of finding a path to all users. The client will come with a recommended hub address.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:24:38
What type of timeline would you expect to redevelop their backend? Isn't the general sentiment that it takes 1-2 years to fully develop and test new features?
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:40:14
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:04:11


Agreed, so either Oct 26 or Dec 6.  Although it's hard to scold them for not preparing for block gridlock and insane fees.  Anytime it was brought up here, the idea was shot down as unrealistic FUD.  This place has changed from "High fees are temporary" to "Companies should have prepared for high fees."  The narrative changes so quickly, yet there's no accountability for last month's narrative.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:58:28
Which tier of nodes has become obsolete due to Segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:06:37
How long does this type of development work take?
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:03:53
Please link the website with the metric that you have decided is most important.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:34:17
Two problems.
1. Devs are telling people not to run on mainnet until the mainnet beta is released. 
2. This will force their hand to make future versions backwards compatible. That means the transaction limit and channel limit might become permanent. It's shaping up to be another scaling debate.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:59:47
BTC is open source coded program
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:14:30
Should we shame and boycott, or is this one of those double standard situations?
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:44:28
And in the past 24 hours 140-200 got stuck for over an hour multiple times.  As we speak, your promise of every transaction over 100sat/byte is failing.  The very next block after you posted didn't clear out the 200-300 range.  Your fictional 100sat/byte fee would have been stuck for over an hour now and counting...
There's competition for next block confirmation.  If you want next block confirmation, you're not going to use 5, 10, 20, or even 100. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:15:42
So it's not ready for adoption until they remove the limit?
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:42:58


So in the interview he said they are looking at adding it.  The blog says they are planning to implement it.  Still waiting for the source that says...let me grab your quote real fast:


@_date: 2018-01-09 23:52:03


@_date: 2018-01-23 00:53:28
Yes, users should not be tinkering with the transaction and channel limits.  It's a spec that was agreed upon by all LN developers at the Milan Summit.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:12:12
Can you explain how atomic swaps bypass the Bitcoin fees?
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:13:20
224 Satoshi is incorrect. You are demanding precision from me. Please demand the same from yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:38:24
You're mixing up "can" and "will".  Occasionally 9sat/byte *can* get confirmed in the next block.  But using 9sat/byte doesn't guarantee that your transaction *will* get into the next block.  For entities to guarantee that a transaction will be processed in under an hour, they must use 200+ sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:05:18
It's unfortunate that we've chosen a path that is completely controlled by 1 or 2 companies.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:20:44


May 2018.  That's when the Core client gets full Segwit support.  These are the most experienced blockchain developers in the world.  You said it should take 1-2 months right?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:01:29
Your formatting shows up as 224 on mobile.  Desktop shows the correct exponential format.  My bad.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:18:58
Exactly. These fees are cheap. The competitive rate for this unique service is in the $3000-$5000 range per transaction. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:12:47
Ahh I understand.  So the witness graph is the best graph for understanding Segwit adoption?  Currently 8%.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:57:00
Or just a few blocks skewing the metric.  The 144 moving average cleared those blocks and Segwit adoption [tanked from 19% to 9%](  I'm all for adoption, but we need to stop with fake hype.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:57:07
Yes I heard that Segwit adoption is up to 30% now.  
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:53:28
Should is the key word. But the LN transaction limit is $500. So already you're saying we should be able to do something that isn't possible.
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:13:26
Transaction volume is about half what it was a month ago.  We're fixing the mempool problem by driving users away.  Right now we're at about November 2016 levels of transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:37:39
Are high fees and full mempool bad?  [I thought they were a good thing](
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:28:05
Hardwired limits from the spec:




MUST set the four most significant bytes of amount_msat to 0.
Transaction amount is limited to 4 bytes in units of msat, which is 0.0429 BTC.  


Channel funding limit is 2\^24 satoshi or 0.168 BTC.
Changing these limits will make new nodes incompatible with old nodes.  The entire network will have to be rebuilt from scratch.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:42:26


Or until their ongoing Segwit/batching development finishes.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:39:55
LTC is a centralized coin.  It's equivalent to a 4x proposal for Bitcoin.  LTC is positioned halfway between 2x and BCH.  If 2x is bad, then LTC is worse.  You can't be pro-Core and pro-LTC at the same time.  The logic collides.

@_date: 2017-12-22 20:56:40
I'm saying there isn't a problem today.  You asked if we need long term solutions.  I believe the answer is no.  Bitcoin is perfectly fine the way it is today and will be fine in 10 years without change.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:36:32
We used to be psyched about increased adoption. Now we cheer when people stop using Bitcoin. Unbelievable.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:08:00

Wasn't the consensus that we would double capacity in 1 month?  What happened to that prediction, and did anyone warn us that it might take much longer than a month to double capacity?

@_date: 2017-12-23 22:02:45
Thank you for this.  I was unaware that Segwit increases network load, blockchain size, and processing time.  I was sold on the idea that Segwit reduces all of these, which is why it was supposed to be the superior scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:22:03
I'm simply recycling the language being used. I was challenging a comment that said that LN is largely complete. I think it is lazy hype language without substance. As you said, there is no such thing as complete, so how can it be largely complete? Please redirect your outrage to the correct person who is claiming that an open source project is largely complete.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:24:11
You're lecturing about financial literacy and risk management, and your idea of a diversified, risk averse portfolio is 100% cryptocurrency? You are the person that you claim to hate.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:03:00
Yes the paper says that the main chain is still required. I’m not sure you have read the paper.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:35:30
The answer is there.  It's temporary and will resume climbing soon.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:42:06
It really is that simple. One group makes the rules for the fee market. The other group operates within the fee market. If users don't like how the fee market is operating then they shouldn't aim pitchforks at other users. That's the whole point of a fee market. They should aim pitchforks at the devs to change the rules or don't aim pitchforks at all.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:05:19
How are you diversified?
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:03:05
Reclaim means of exchange and increase adoption. I agree, but when is this important? It's not important today. If it's not important today, what is the catalyst that will suddenly make it important?
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:57:42
This would be a perfect opportunity for a real world demonstration.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:20:02
I wish we could get this type of tolerance for exchanges implementing Segwit. Pitchforks for exchanges and infinite patience for LN and Core wallet. The duality is astounding.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:05:16
The major selling points were user consensus and double transaction capacity in a month. Was this a massive astroturfing campaign, or were the experts just wrong about their predictions? Did anyone predict that it would take so long to convert to Segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:57:37
Release dates for these 3 complete implementations?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:36:33
Interesting, so 12% of the transactions are legit and the other 88% are fake astroturfing. And LTC has 4x Bitcoin transaction capacity, but it doesn't suffer from the same centralization problems that shitcoins have. I like you.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:27:13
Oh, not complete? Release dates for these 3 complete implementations? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:04:28
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:15:50
Doesn't this make it more expensive to run a full node? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:22:45
A similar question is "What is the purpose of scaling?"  If today's situation is acceptable, then scaling is never required.  A long term solution isn't required because it would be a fix to a problem that doesn't exist.
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:28:28
Did we have fee problems in 2016?
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:15:44
Batching hit a peak in 2014. It's not a new technology. So yes to that part of your question. Segwit is great, but hardly a primary reason for the fee levels. Demand is still the primary reason. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:53:58
Truth, sadly it doesn't apply here.
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:29:32


It's not a bad thing that we have Segwit.  But I think it's a bad thing that it was achieved through deceit and coercion.  I don't think you should be proud of the tactics used just because you agree with the outcome.  180 confirmed humans forced Bitcoin to follow their direction.  We should never let something like that happen again.  Next time it might not be a direction that you agree with.
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:03:12
I'd say the participation number is more telling than the percentage.  You said that this was proof that UASF had overwhelming support from the entire Bitcoin community, but only 250 participated.  So at best this is proof that 180 people supported UASF.  That is a staggeringly low number of people.
Edit: For comparison, this thread already has 490 voters.  It's already a more comprehensive sample of the Bitcoin community than that UASF poll.
@_date: 2018-05-16 17:15:36
Add it to the "Bitcoin is dead" list.
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:59:46
Wow that's the first I've heard of that poll. How did he guarantee a perfect cross section of the entire bitcoin community?
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:46:36
That's right.  The sybil-resistant poll has absolutely nothing to do with the economic majority.  The results are meaningless, yet you cited it as proof of economic majority.  This is what I'm talking about when I say that you're using deception to achieve your goals.  All you have to do is cite the economy statistics and the argument about economic majority is settled.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:15:28
I don't think this analogy works here.  The difference between then and now isn't superior JPEG compression or local caching.  It's brute force hardware and infrastructure upgrade.  The internet analogy works better for those advocating on-chain scaling, since it requires hardware upgrades that lead to centralization.

Remember that Bitmain claimed it would mine BCH in private for the first 3 days.  We could see an entirely different chain pop into existence at any moment.

You are correct. This post is trying to fabricate hype about a change in momentum. I think it's pointless because mining hash power is irrelevant to the future direction of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:46:09
Will it be bad if miners signal one thing and then end up not following through with their hash power?
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:43:07
Yes! Miners don't decide. Only a select group of developers and companies control Bitcoin. This is how it should be.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:51:25
Yes absolutely! This NYA signaling is clearly an attack from the American government. They control 90% of the Bitcoin hash power, so we need to break free from them. That's the only way to guarantee a decentralized group of miners.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:08:29
Yes, now we finally get to see if Segwit lives up to the performance hype.  I'm excited to see the mempool drain to 0.

Isn't it illegal if he tries to steal their code? 2x will never happen. There is zero support and devs are taking the appropriate steps to protect their code from outside influence.

MTP is median time past.  It's the median of the timestamps of the previous 11 blocks.  It's essentially the timestamp from 6 blocks ago.  Since miners may all have slightly different clocks, the blockchain needs a way to guarantee that it is past a certain time.  Important for events like tonight.  You can't just trust the clock on the miner.  It might try to cheat and claim to be an hour ahead and prematurely trigger an event.  The idea is that out of 12 blocks, they won't all be cheating their clocks.  Any cheated clocks will be outliers, and the median will be trustworthy enough to prove that we are beyond that time.
TLDR: Must wait 6 blocks after the trigger time to trigger an event.

Guys holding shorts right now still predicting one more dip.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:45:36
Yes, and looking at their hash rate there isn't a significant drop.  Right now we must operate on the assumption that Bitmain is not acting maliciously.  They simply do not support BCH.  We have to assume that they were bluffing when they said they would mine BCH while ignoring the short-term economic incentives of mining BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:52:58
Why? Everyone knows that miner votes carry zero weight. That's just not how Bitcoin works. Hash power is probably the least important part of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:09:24
Going into the fork 37% of hash power was signaling BCC. They all backed out because BTC is worth more than BCC. That is an important piece of data to inform what "controls" Bitcoin. It's not hash rate or nodes. It's simply price. The rest is just virtue signaling.

2 notes.  First, that block required 10sat/byte to get in.  You hurt our credibility when you lie and say 1sat/byte always gets in.  Second, all of those pinks today are the same user in a single transaction chain.  You can trace his transactions starting from address 1CDahmUu9LGkNo8DUHQcyPg73GbdHmT3Zu.  The balance begins around 0.37BTC and it's currently down to 0.29BTC over 21 transactions (all today).  It looks like he's trying to burn the balance.  The block you linked has 4 of his transactions all at unreasonably high fees. 
This isn't a "some people" problem or a general wallet fee problem.  This is a single person doing something suspicious.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:30:00
Wow this seems very unfair to hold bitcoin hostage with small block sizes. Clearing the mempool is very important, and it's sad to see a single malicious actor keeping us from efficiently processing all transactions.

The standard for analyzing batching is to look at payments per transaction.  This splits out the batched outputs into individual payments so we can see how much batching is going on.  [Here is the payments/transaction chart for almost 6 years](  Ignoring the 2015 noisy spikes, we hit a batching max of 2.4 payments per transaction in July 2014.  Today we're at 1.86 and in a downtrend from our recent high of 2.06 in January.
This is why I'm saying that batching isn't the primary driver.  I am pro-Bitcoin.  I want to see demand increase.  I'm sad that demand is down right now.  However, I'm a slave to the data and I will not blatantly ignore it just because it doesn't fit my desires.

The 2013 bubble averaged 50% per week for a month (5x in 1 month).  If we're in the 8000-9000 range this weekend then we're at the start of a bubble.  Otherwise this just looks like all the other step-ups from 2016 and 2017.  Right now we're seeing &lt;20% gains per week.  We had bigger weekly gains on the runs up to 5000 and 3000, and similar weekly gains on the run up to 1200.

Sadly it's not common knowledge on either side.  Most of the debate these days has gone partisan "us vs. them", so all nuance has been lost.  
I did the research myself, mostly last year after hearing how evil Pai was for wanting to give a net neutrality waiver to small ISPs.  Something about the tone made me want to dig down and find his actual statements and actual stance on the issue.  Even if you disagree with him, I think it's important to at least understand his perspective.

Nodes are used to vote for the protocol you want.  The majority of nodes are users hosting from their home PC on home network.  These are legit votes.  S2X is using remote servers hosted by Amazon to fake node votes.  It gives the illusion of having a lot of users when the reality is that it's all fake and against Amazon rules.  Meanwhile pure Bitcoin has no Amazon nodes, so our vote count is genuine.

@_date: 2017-11-07 15:04:07
Different kind of consensus.  Consensus rules are the block validation rules such as block size and mining reward.  Changing the rules means the new chain is not valid.

@_date: 2017-11-07 12:47:10
Maybe that's the case for 2x when it would be impossible for a personal computer to run a node.  The whole point of keeping blocks small is so that we never have to use VPS nodes.  Nodes should always be personal computers on a home network.

I don't think anyone is against the concept of Net Neutrality.  The disagreement is in implementation and efficacy.  The arguments against Title II are that:
A) It's a [1930s regulation]( that has nothing to do with net neutrality.  It has 47 sections, but the FCC claims it will only apply 6 of those sections to broadband for now.  They can change their interpretation and enforce all 47 sections at any moment.  The net neutrality language that's enforced is "All practices must be just and reasonable," where the FCC decides the definition of just and reasonable.  The law is completely left up to interpretation.
B) Because the regulation is so vague and heavy handed, the reporting requirements are expensive and don't scale down for small ISPs. This gives large ISPs a competitive advantage.  When Title II was first implemented, small ISPs were given a waiver.  However this waiver was taken away last year.  If you follow the debate, this was the trigger point for Pai to fight against Title II.  Most of his lobby money comes from small ISP groups, and he fought hard to keep the waiver.  When the waiver was lost, his only choice was to begin fighting to kill Title II completely.
C) Title II does not protect net neutrality.  Right now Riot Games (makers of League of Legends) [pays ISPs to redirect player traffic to their private backbone]( to reduce lag.  This is a private fast lane that violates net neutrality yet is legal under Title II.  It's probably legal because of point A: Title II is a vague 1930's regulation with nothing to do with net neutrality.
The brilliant part of this debate is that it has been sold as net neutrality vs no net neutrality.  Of course everyone wants net neutrality.  The correct question is whether or not Title II achieves the vision for net neutrality in a fair way.  Some people think no, some people think yes.

I like how he clearly defines centralization in a real world example.  5 companies owning 90% of the internet backbone infrastructure sets a perfect example of centralization that we must avoid.  Our mining ecosystem is significantly more decentralized and we must keep it this way.

@_date: 2018-03-05 01:06:25
Sorry but this is wrong.  Demand is [down 50% from our December peak](  The article claims that this had a "fractional minority" effect on the number of transactions while the majority comes from batching.  Calculations show that the decrease in demand had a much larger effect than batching.
If we look at [batching]( then we see that our outputs/transaction ratio increased from 2.7 in December to 3.0 in January.  These ratios are deceptive because a standard transaction always has 2 outputs (1 returns to sender as change).  So we need to subtract 1 from these ratios.  That leaves us with 1.7 and 2.0 as our batching ratios.  This is an 18% increase in batching.  For this to be a majority effect, we need it to be over 100% to offset the 50% decrease in apparent demand.  18% &lt;&lt; 100%, so batching is the minority effect compared to the decline in demand.
What's most interesting to me is if you [look back further in time]( the Payments per Transaction tab).  We had more batching during 2014 and 2015 than we have today.  Payments/transaction slowly declined from 2.4 in 2014 to 1.5 in 2017.  So this idea that batching is some new optimization is false.  Our level today is just a return to the batching level we had in late 2015.
Notice how I'm using numbers and sources with real data.  Notice how the article does not include any numbers, calculations, or sources.  Feel free to correct my calculations or methods if you believe that I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:08:46


Exactly my point.  On December 22 we reached peak mempool backlog with 261k transactions pending.  On January 19 we saw the mempool begin to empty.  The question is why.  The two theories are:
1. Batching dramatically increased and demand remained relatively stable.
2. Demand dramatically decreased and batching remained relatively stable.
As you say, we saw an enormous temporary increase in volume during the bull run that disappeared once it was done.  The temporary peak is important because it caused the mempool spike, and its absence caused the mempool to drain.  The mempool didn't empty because of batching.
To ease your mind about cherry picking, I grabbed the average demand rate from October 26 to January 19.  That's the beginning of the mempool filling up until the flushing date.  The average number of transactions added to the mempool per second was 3.94 during that period.  And then do the same for the flushing date until February 22 when the mempool hit 0 and we get 2.44 transactions per second.  That's a 38% reduction in demand, or the equivalent of a 61% increase in batching.  61% &gt;&gt; 18%.  It's still no contest.  The mempool emptied because of changes in demand, not a massive increase in batching.
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:25:03
Unknown, we can only speculate.  Some theories are:
1. Batching - [Data]( show a 5-10% increase in batching during that period.
2. Spam - The claim is that the majority of transactions since 2015 have been spam and this is the first time we've seen accurate demand.
3. High fees - The claim is that users and businesses left Bitcoin because it stopped being affordable to use.
4. Price crash - The claim is that users left Bitcoin because the price crashed.
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:35:09


That's a good point.  At the [start of October]( we had 295 transactions per day vs 334 for ETH/LTC/BCH combined.  Yesterday we had 160 transcations vs 690 for ETH/LTC/BCH combined.  Total transactions have gone up by 35%, but BTC transactions have gone down by 46%.  Your theory that users have fled Bitcoin for other coins might be correct.

There are two ways to solve congestion. One is to reduce usage. The other is to scale up to support usage. Bitcoin was attacked to force us down the first path. Even your graph shows that. I think it's bad that usage is plummeting on your graph. You think it's good. Why?
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:27:26

@_date: 2018-03-04 21:48:14


It absolutely is queue theory.  The very first variable or assumption you must make in queue theory is arrival rate.  Arrival rate in our case is given by the [number of transactions added to the mempool per second](  In November we averaged around 3.5, in December we peaked to 4.8, in January we dropped to 2.5, and February down to 2.0.  


This is wrong.  November arrival rate was 73% of December's peak.  50% would indeed be below November.  The February levels are the lowest arrival rates we've seen in 2 years.  Your claim that our arrival rate is higher than November is an outright lie.

Looks the same to me.  They announced that they were working on this months ago and now it's finished.  People were just desperate to find an enemy to blame for high fees.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:31:59
That's right. They stated what their customers wanted. Their customers didn't want Segwit, yet they still began working on it [months ago]( And they delivered at the same speed as Core. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:39:59
As an optics check, I want to warn you that this looks a lot like an r/btc post.  I say this because of the "10 block average" vs "24 hour average" comparison.  It begs the question why you had to use different metrics to achieve your result.  
Right now if we did a 10 block vs 10 block comparison, BCH would win 62 vs 21.  In fact, when I plot the Segwit 10 block moving average over the past 1000 blocks, I can quickly find your claimed "47" because it's a single maximum outlier cherry picked from a usual oscillation between 10 and 30.  There are no points higher than the exact point you picked.  If you expand the average to a 20 block average at the exact same point then it drops to 32.  So that explains why you had to go as small as "10 block average" to find this unicorn.  
One day very soon your metric will be true 100% of the time.  That is the time to call it out (using apples to apples math).  Right now it just comes across as intentionally misleading and therefore looks like an r/btc post to me.
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:31:37
Yes exactly these comments. 1 week for the entire development start to finish and no bugs. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:20:10
I think it's dangerous to take the stance that low fees are important.
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:53:53
Wow so there's zero tax incentive to move to Puerto Rico? Those guys are getting scammed big time.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:58:45
OP either doesn't know how to read his own chart or is intentionally misrepresenting his chart.  The chart shows a peak in December (during heavy backlog) and a sharp decline since then (mempool clearing).
Please show me a chart that shows that transactions or outputs or any metric of your choosing is higher than mid December.
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:10:22
More reddit posters encouraging LN on mainnet. This is unfortunate.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:00:38
From 9950. There was absolutely zero chance we were going to break through 10k on our first try. It was the most obvious and easiest short of the year. Just like bouncing off 5k. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:55:26
Great, what are the storage and bandwidth thresholds when they become a problem?
I'll help you get started.  For bandwidth you claim that 100GB/day is 100% ok for all users around the world and 400GB/day is unsustainable.  So it's somewhere between those two numbers.
For storage you claim that 1TB in 10 years is 100% ok for all users around the world and 4TB in 10 years is unsustainable.  So it's somewhere between those two numbers.
Edit: Crickets.  Turns out the actual numbers don't exist.  It's an empty argument with zero technical backing.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:39:50
Seriously, how can someone be so wrong?  It's like he just makes things up hoping people will believe him.  It might work for his blind followers, but frankly he can keep them.  We have no use for people like that.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:08:02
Oh, I definitely misunderstood you.  Where did you end up selling on this bubble?
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:48:27
OP's graph says December outputs were 30,666,017 and January's outputs were 25,721,328.  A reduction of 16%.  You can see the exact same reduction in outputs on my source if you click the outputs button.
Which numbers are you using on OP's graph that lead you to believe that outputs didn't decrease in January?
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:45:57


Is it important which chain the miners support?
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:37:49
It depends how you define spam.  OP says that yesterday's spike in mempool is spam.  u/tke1600 calls it 100% spam from a Bcash campaign.  Do you agree?
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:30:01


A perfect summary, thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:26:10
Yes absolutely.  Now show me that batching doubled since mid December.  My source says it's up 5% since mid December (18% if you pick the single peak day on Jan 27).
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:03:27
It's not mine.  That's a great question and I don't know the answer, but I see where you're going.  For best case we can reduce the ratio by 1 across the board.  So then the December ratio would be 1.6 and today's ratio would be 1.8 (13% gain).  Possibly a more accurate view of batching penetration and also a more favorable percent increase.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:37:50
Inspiration comes through collaboration :)
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:34:54
Immune to government intervention unlike the obviously compromised miners.  I can't wait to fire the corrupt miners and give power back to the rightful owners of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:54:40
Demand dropped to below 50% of December levels.  That's what emptied the mepool, not SegWit's 14% adoption.  Learn some basic queue theory.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:57:31
Litecoin has become incredibly centralized, so it's no surprise that he's eager to jump ship.
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:29:38
Sorry but I'm in the opposite camp.  I want to see demand for Bitcoin increase.  An empty mempool is scary to me.  Demand is the [lowest we've seen in 2 years](  We've suffered an attack to drive users away from Bitcoin, and unfortunately it was successful.  A non-zero mempool is hopefully a sign of recovery and not just a temporary bounce.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:13:57
Transactions added to mempool per second:
We were at 4.8 transactions/second in mid December and now we're at 2.6 transactions/second.  This is why the mempool is clearing.  Batching is up 18% and Segwit is up 2% in the same period.  Yes it's good progress, but nothing compared to the halving in demand.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:30:51
Pump money into AWS. Point to node count as the only trustworthy source of votes. Easy win.
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:23:52
Pretty sure miner voting is meaningless in this argument.  Why even discuss it?  Can you explain why it's important?
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:49:27
Wow we're over 50%! Majority miners means that Bitcoin stays 1mb right?
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:09:15
I'm disagreeing with your idea that you could stand up to Core if you disagreed with their direction.  The only acceptable course of action would be to write better code.  What other option would you have?
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:24:23
Right, so increasing blocksize isn't actually a problem from a storage or bandwidth standpoint.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:51:15
This is an internal money transfer from your Coinbase account to Lightning Ramp's Coinbase account.  And then Lightning Ramp internally marks some of their LN node money as yours.  There are two "PayPal jumps", one inside Coinbase and one inside Lightning Ramp.  When I say PayPal jump, I mean trusting a 3rd party to do internal accounting to transfer money around (non-blockchain transactions).  This is the exact type of transaction that Bitcoin was invented to replace.
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:48:38
Ethereum has a hard fork coming up this month.  If you check in on them, you'll realize that their situation is the same as ours.  One group sees it as an attack and wants to stick with the current code while another group sees it as an upgrade.  I don't expect exchanges to list the ETH fork as a separate coin to seek out economic majority.
@_date: 2018-03-05 06:52:21
Thank you for the calculations and sources.  You're my favorite person.
You say that it's not fair to use November/December data because it's an abnormal spike, but I think it's relevant since every one of these discussions is centered around the mempool emptying.  The mempool filled up because of this abnormal spike.  Now as you said, we're returning to the same levels we were at 1-2 years ago.  The mempool wasn't clogged 1-2 years ago with that demand, and it's not clogged today with the same demand.  Fundamentally, that's the reason for the empty mempool.
I'm glad you pointed out the high input volume.  This indeed looks like consolidation and mirrors my findings when Binance dumped a lot of consolidation transactions onto the market last week.  It was [labeled as malicious spam]( from users too lazy to dig into the blockchain.  I'm curious to see how the inputs/outputs chart looks in 1-2 months after the consolidation is finished.  Right now the inputs are carrying the torch to maintain an upward trend while the outputs take a breather.  I'm hoping the dip in outputs is temporary like we saw in August and September last year.  I'll be worried if outputs don't make a full recovery by May.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:31:46


I don't know why it's so hard for people to understand this.  There are perfectly healthy coins out there that they can move to if they want cheaper or faster transactions.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:44:36
No.  "Neither solution is required" means exactly that.  Bitcoin is working great exactly how it is.  It doesn't require sidechains or increased block size.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:23:54
Try what? Scale to 2x the transaction capacity? Haven't they already scaled to 4x? And now everyone is calling to change to Litecoin as the superior option. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:40:37
Why didn't rule  apply to Segwit?
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:13:12
Wow 1.2mb!!
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:04:17
At this point it's pretty obvious that we must change the PoW algorithm so that the true owners of Bitcoin can maintain control.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:06:44
And then it will be LN. Your outrage will never cease.
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:22:13
Yes the demand for more capacity is far too strong to even consider scaling up.
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:22:54
Yes, huge issue if it goes through. It's basically the definition of centralization. The only way Bitcoin can remain decentralized is for everyone to follow Core's direction.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:23:05
My guess is 2017.  "Told ya so" people are typically 2017.  If he was holding since the price was $20 then $10,000 isn't a "told ya so" moment.  Well it is, but in the opposite direction.
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:21:14
Yes there was actually a strong push from core to kill off Segwit because it didn't have 100% support.
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:27:34
Yes, this place was swarming with claims that Segwit had economic consensus and would take 1 month to be adopted. You were labeled as the enemy of Bitcoin if you suggested that it might take months or even a year to fully adopt Segwit. Now those promises have suddenly disappeared. That economic consensus has suddenly disappeared. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:09:14
Almost like they were pressured to push out software before it was ready. We had a dedicated daily thread for shaming Coinbase into releasing Segwit asap. Now we get to reap what we sowed.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:05:11
True. High fees will draw miners in. Really a win win with low block size and high fees.
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:26:15
Those were all max fee bids (100 sat/byte).  That's the first sign that it's not spam.  The transaction count went up by 238 for 10.4MB of transaction data.  That's a sign that it's batching with large inputs or outputs.  Dig through some of those blocks and you find transactions like [this]( with 500 inputs taking up 7% of a block.  Check the output address (1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s) and do a google search and you find that it's a [Binance wallet](
The best part is their tweet from 2 weeks ago with that address might as well be written directly to you:




@_date: 2018-02-06 17:01:04
Bingo.  It was clear that you didn't trade through those months.  Each one had a 10% dip or larger, and each time we get people like you swarming in to say that Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:59:21
Fire the miners! It's time for a PoW change.
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:26:00
2X is zero threat with no support. Why come at it from such a weak position begging for them to stop?
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:56:53
Miner signaling doesn't matter, only node count. Fire up your nodes and vote. We have never used miner signaling for any previous upgrades, so why should we start now?
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:04:00
Wow the article also claims that Binance is 70% fake volume.  Bring on the boycotts.  Coinmarketcap must delist Binance immediately.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:17:36


@_date: 2017-10-07 07:16:21
Well first step is to fight off 2x. Then we can deal with the scaling discussion when we have a few years to properly prepare for it.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:51:53
Fees are low and transactions fast. Segwit adoption is growing exponentially. 2x isn't needed.
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:52:22
It's bad because you will need a $4000 computer and dedicated fiber line to run a node on 2X.  BCH and LTC are already running into this problem where normal citizens don't have access to the technology needed to run a node.  
LTC is involved because the creator of LTC is currently the most vocal supporter of 1X.  He is basing this on his experience running a coin with 4x the capacity of BTC.  That's how he knows that a coin with more capacity will end up as a failure.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:52:51
He said 5 years to reach 20%. Talk about being way off!
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:26:22
Right, like if a minority of ETH miners decided that they wanted to stick to the original code.  It would be too difficult for them to just use the current code, so they would need to propose a change to the PoW algorithm to survive.
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:18:45
Oh my bad, I thought we were voting with nodes for this fork.  How are we voting?
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:54:16
I've found the best way to explain it to these idiots is compare Segwit to this. Segwit had overwhelming consensus among all parties from an early stage and didn't require this coercion tactic like 2x is employing.
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:12:17
All of the block size problems in your first source also apply to Segwit.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:15:03


Exactly, we need smaller blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:22:53
Yes this is why we must make sure that the developers have full control. Even the white paper spells out how the owner of the code is the central owner of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:26:32
It's crazy to think people want to run any code different from Satoshi's original code. Do they not see how dumb they look?
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:36:03
I hope we see a change to upgrade proposals.  The requirement for 95% of miners to signal Segwit always confused me.  Hashrate is meaningless, so why not just flip the switch and keep going?  Why was Segwit held hostage for so long?
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:49:21
Are we back on the trendline for business adoption and usage?
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:21:34
This. Segwit is the original chain and has been here since the beginning with unanimous support. Anyone wanting to change the Segwit chain needs to convince the owners to allow it.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:27:47
Bingo.  Charlie has found the best path to boost Litecoin's value.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:59:33
And frankly that's not even a priority. We have LTC if you want a cheap, fast transaction. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:15:00
It's bad.  Litecoin has 4x the transaction capacity and it's a disaster right now.  Charlie is already proposing to reduce the block size of Litecoin to minimize the impact of such a devastating design flaw.
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:16:18
I'm happy we are finally proving who owns Bitcoin. Now no one can ever steal Bitcoin from its rightful owners. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:25:46
It was absolutely unanimous. Core would never support a fork without unanimous support.
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:58:15
Does the white paper spell out some way to distribute these voting rights for balanced power?
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:24:09
I don't think it will ever be needed. It's a self balancing system. When we hit our transaction cap, businesses stop using Bitcoin and that frees up capacity. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:34:56
Can you explain your concern and purpose for posting?  There is zero risk of miners mining 2X.  2X by definition is a non-event with no support.  Why even discuss it?
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:10:58
I disagree. There's no match for the level of quality coming out of Core. I just don't see an instance where someone like you can come in and write better code.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:53:16
Miner signaling doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:32:24
I mean the $350 transaction limit.  has confirmed that we will be able to send unlimited sized transactions across the current network without problem.
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:26:00
This is assuming that Bitcoin has a scaling problem in its current form. I would argue that it doesn't and neither solution is required.
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:52:49
I agree! I propose PoS.
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:51:22
I hope we stick to this rule for all future upgrades. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:16:25
True, I suppose it might turn out that Charlie is just trying to keep his advantage over BTC.  I have faith that he'll hold to his plans to scale LTC down to a safe level.  We'll see.
As for nodes, every person who owns Bitcoin should be running a node.  
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:38:42
And yet these posts keep coming. 2X has zero support and miners won't mine it. No propaganda required. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:10:45
Yes an absolute joke.  What was even the basis for such a terrible idea like miner voting?  I'm looking forward to the new method where all forks are listed on exchanges to let the market decide.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:07:49
Oh now I understand.  So the purpose is to have instant transactions, not more transactions.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:04:11


We need to get this in the sidebar. It's about time we make it clear who is and isn't allowed in our sub.
@_date: 2018-07-16 22:09:31
Yes I linked directly to Alex's comment.  Jeff said that the adoption would take months or years.  Alex said it was disingenuous spin.  In hindsight we now know that Jeff's prediction was dead on true and Alex's comment was actually the spin.  
What's even better is that Alex linked to a [news story]( saying that blockchain.info was ready to convert to Segwit immediately.  He used this as proof that the Segwit rollout would be swift.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the blockchain.info wallet still doesn't support Segwit.  In hindsight we now know that this was disingenuous spin.
Look I'm not anti-Bitcoin.  It's OK that Segwit is taking time to rollout.  I think it was easy to predict that it would take a long time to achieve the full benefits of the capacity increase.  You claim that most people you follow said it would take this long to reach 40%.  Please feel free to link directly to these comments to completely destroy my argument. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:16:04
Will this reset to 0 when we remove the transaction limit?
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:58:19
Only undesirable if you want Bitcoin to be successful. If you run a competing coin like LTC then it's very desirable.
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:36:03
Good.  Glad to see us get rid of miner voting.  Hopefully this exchange voting is just a one time 2X thing and then we can change to a system that appropriately benefits us.  Maybe even a change away from PoW to Pos so we can fire miners for good.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:42:00
Wow it sounds like we all have different experiences that color our perspectives. I respect your talents in achieving your 180x gains.  That's quite a feat.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:12:38
No, outputs per transaction are at 2.84.  In mid December they were ~2.7.  That's a 5% increase in batching.
Check the source: 
Feel free to counter with your own source that shows a doubling in outputs per transaction.
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:02:22
Yes that's exactly right.  Max channel size is ~0.17 and max transaction size is ~0.04.  Both have small limits.  Both limits are written into the LN spec.
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:11:10
For future reference, it's these lines:




amount_msat is limited to 4 bytes on Bitcoin (larger for Litecoin).  4 bytes in msat is 0.0429BTC or about $350.  This spec was set back at the Milan Summit with the intention of limiting transactions to $10.  
My advice is to track down the source that told you that transactions are not limited and make sure they correct the error.
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:32:32
Yes! 2X will need more CEOs on their side if they want to be the real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:49:40
That's a lot easier!  Happy to see this is how we decide upgrades now.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:25:07
I want a Bitcoin that follows the directions of our developers regardless of what miners vote.  Miners don't exist to make decisions.  They should have no say in these decisions and need to be fired if they don't follow our direction.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:55:29
This makes me happy knowing that we will never have a block size increase. Zero upside and all downside. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:42:57
Soon enough to absorb the growth in transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:08:35
I think we've thoroughly proven that decentralized is not healthy for Bitcoin.  90% of our decentralized system is voting to destroy Bitcoin.  It's clear that a decentralized group cannot be trusted and we need to transfer power to a central group of owners.  If not PoS, is there something like Proof of Development that we can implement to make sure the right people have control?
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:25:59
Back off from what? It has no support and zero chance of success. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:24:26
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:35:00
It's to vote against 2x. The only way to run an honest vote is to count nodes. This way you can't cheat by simply buying up hash power like the centralized miners all did. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:38:56
It's always wise to pull coins out of CB, but there's no increased urgency due to the ETH hard fork.  That's because the ETH hard fork is being treated like a normal hard fork.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:11:53
Yes, 100% of the hash power signaling NYA is controlled by Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:36:50
That way the 5% control the 95%. Soon we will definitively know who owns Bitcoin and luckily it has nothing to do with majority or voting.
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:25:37
It was always going to take over a year.  Unfortunately if you mentioned this a year ago you were labeled anti-Bitcoin.  Now we know that the claimed 1 month rollout was simply a lie.
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:24:28
I checked the [LN spec]( and the 0.04BTC limit is still there.  This is the spec that all LN clients follow.  It defines LN.  Can you link to the spec of the unlimited protocol you are talking about?
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:53:34
I think it's good that we finally know who owns Bitcoin. Now it's time to fire the miners.
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:11:59
Remember when people were labeled anti-bitcoin for predicting that it would take months or even years to reach full adoption? 
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:51:32
Oh wow, the value limit was removed?  When did that happen?
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:16:27
If blocks aren't full, then what is the purpose of LN?
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:15:42
When was the last time you did a wire transfer?
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:24:42
It's always sell half. It doesn't matter how much you make, people will always tell you to sell half. It's advice that is clueless about how you got to where you are now.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:44:29
Not enough demand. We need fees to be high to drive money towards LN. If demand is low then LN won't have traffic and will look like a failure.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:43:47
Annnd it's gone.
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:14:18
