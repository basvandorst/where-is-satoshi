The first video,[ LN simply explained]( needs to be replaced or edited in my opinion. This video makes LN seem like it will be a lot more complicated for the end user with a lot of extra steps. Look at some of the comments on youtube, people don't understand it: '-Why would anyone want to go through all this trouble??? It is a lot easier to use some other crypto...﻿', and all the upvotes they get. They don't understand that once LN is implemented and adopted they won't need to do anything extra and that all that stuff will happen automatically in the background. 
Taking away vital information from an educational video does not magically make it simple, this makes LN seem like a terrible solution for someone that hasn't done extra research. Having this video as the 'simple explanation' will cause more confusion/FUD than belief/positivity about LN.

See that's what I thought. So while there are no official authorities for cryptocurrencies, exchanges do act like them wether we like it or not.

If that's all it takes to go to hell, I wonder where I'm going..

And that's partly why I'm asking, so Iota has solved this issue and surely this is something bitcoin wants too, but when bitcoin has solved this issue then what is the point of Iota?

I'm just thinking if I was a scammer that'd be something I'd do. Create a coin called bitcoin and offer 'bitcoin' for stuff, but it's actually only a shitcoin worth $1. If nothing stops people from creating a coin called bitcoin I find it weird that no one has ever at least tried that, or have they?

What are you moving to? BCH?

No I think the mods disabled it. If I just couldn't find it then I'm just a retard.

I didn't mean for it to be arbitrary. The difference between the axis are the exact same percentages in both examples, and the timeframe is 3 months for both. Just trying to show that the 2013 bubble was much more clearly a bubble than the one we might be having now.

Wasn't meant to be misleading. The different between the axis' are set to be the same percentage, and the timeframe is exactly 3 months for both.

Except sometimes it does. It's important to keep the eyes open for good opportunities.

i actually lol'ed.. just a typo :D

That's true, but I'm kinda thinking of bitcoin differently since it is no corporation. Like, what was the competitor to the internet? Or is that just a terrible analogy?

So what stops people from making a new coin called Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:05:41
So just slowly but steadily implement the features that have proven to be good in other cryptos? Is that what it happening? Is that kinda what is happening with segwit and lightning?

This must be a troll post.. terrible information, do not listen to this.

If you're going to adjust for inflation you need to do it on both sides for a correct comparison. The 10,000 BTC would then be $84,240,816.

No, but consistency is important

Personally I don't have any demands that aren't already filled by other apps.

Arrest this man. He SHARED a thought he found from SOMEONE ELSE. Get your pitchforks everyone! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:08:53
Rules dont work the same way in the crypto world. He is now 87.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:09:53
Correction, moments later and he's now down to 3 :/

Thanks for the replies, it's still a technology that I struggle a little bit to understand. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:23:22
Haha, no 'alt' means 'everything' :)

Kristoffer Hansen. Some 33 year old investor, he did this recently at just under $2800. He's going 'all in' and while they don't want to comment on how much exactly, they're saying it is a 'considerable amount'.
