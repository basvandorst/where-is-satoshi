Pretty sure I got it. And I can't thank you enough for posting about ledger - I don't have a ton of btc but enough that I wouldn't want to lose them.

I just ordered a nano S and a trezor (the latter backordered). And of course, Coinbase.com is down now. Sad!

Do you mind giving me an ELI5 on how I would use the hardware wallet with my coinbase wallet (had one since 2013)? I think I understand the concept of sw vs hw wallets, but..not sure what I do from there.
Thanks in advance!

Thanks for this - interesting - as a seller you can elect to receive gift card codes - like from Amazon. Really, really smart.

It was so simple. I have a nano 2 coming tomorrow that I was going to use as a backup but I understand that the encryption is different? I'll just order another keepkey. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:20:20
I went the keepkey route and thought about doing the exact thing: mirroring two keepkeys in separate safes. But on third thought, this gives burglars twice the chance of getting my btc/eth- stupid. So I store the keepkey in one safe and the seed words in another. And showed my family how it all works. I also xfered.1 btc, wiped and recovered with no problem, fwiw.

Unless you're bank is "on the list" (major banks) you'll have to wire the money in the first time. After that you can ACH.

Good clarification.

Hey if you want one and didn't ask for one previously - [here's]( the original post.
Just PM me if you want one.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:50:57
THANK YOU! been wondering about the origin. "So I've had some whisky.."

.003btc ought to do it. Or if you're a diehard hodler, free. PM
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:02:18
Yeah - I think they'll be here in 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:23:14
Sorry- Coinbase still has the outage. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:05:17
If you want one, just pm me and don't worry about it! I do have a coinbase wallet (thanks ), come to think of it. That would be free if you have one.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:21:27
OK, quick update since apparently a few of you want them (~25/100 gone) - I should have them in 5 days - I do have a coinbase wallet you can send to for free if you want to. But I honestly don't care if you do or not. Just PM me that you want one or more, then I'll pm you when they're in and you can send your address, etc. They cost me $2.24 each total, fwiw.

Gemini has the same fee setup. But if you're just a buyer, the fees are .25% - about 5x lower than Coinbase. And I get notices when CB/GDAX go down (like yesterday). Gemini was still up.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:35:50
I guess... let's figure out the cost. As long as you send us a pic, that's all that matters! Pm me if you haven't   
@_date: 2019-11-18 15:21:59
It went through no issues! (USAA)
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:27:24
PM me.
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:15:56
Well crap then. That was my next easy choice. I'll still give it a try.

If you'd like to revisit the hilarious HODL genesis, it's [here](
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:18:21
I hope you sent that key by email or something. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:19:05
Kudos to you for innovation! And I hope you sent that key to him in a way he could copy and paste ��
