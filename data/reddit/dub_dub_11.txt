That's true. I think BTC has the potential to work as a tool for equality -but equally as a tool for full-blooded anarcho-capitalism.

-Screw banks
-To transact with others is a fundamental right, we need sound money... wait what?
-Our current system of using currency to pay for stuff has gone stale, let's make a new one instead of doing away with the idea of money -_-

Ya, I hear in Russia it's real easy to avoid taxes so long as you make a nice big gift to Putin! Go live there OP, it's lovely.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:27:36
Pay tax you greedy bastard. You will be left with more money than most people will ever have.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:55:05
Well. Kinda. You are still assigning value to something that only has it's value in context. Right? And as far as I can see that will only lead to problems.

You were both already suggesting tax avoidance, you because you just hate the state (instead of suggesting a logical reason why it's a bad use of the money to cure sick children). From an ethical standpoint, I could see why you might want to avoid paying tax then give a large sum to charity (so long as you don't pretend to be some great altruistic philanthropist ;) )

That is actually a very interesting point. However, from what I can tell (about the blockchain split etc) BTC also suffers somewhat from the problem of giving power -and therefore unfair advantages -to those who have a lot of BTC.

Of course the guy is anti-abortion, should have guessed. You don't give a shit about the danger to the woman do you? Or the work of actually carrying a baby for nine months just to give birth to a baby you can't care for?
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:05:52
We do. But (and BTC certainly looks to be going this way too) all money so far has gone that way :/

Ok then. He can give a portion of the money to a charity of his choice, if he doesn't trust the state to use his money for a good cause.

The problem with Bitcoin, is that it seems to me that it is supposed ti promote equality. Because *in theory* having more Bitcoin doesn't give you more power, just more money. But having more money will always give you more power :/

Or, a larger subreddit with more people who might have suggestions? I don't see how my post here harms you in any way...

In my favourites menu for coindesk, it shows the value when I favourited the page: $2,421.

In what way do you get less? If income of mining on an efficient gpu exceeds power costs... then that is profit. This may be a tricky concept for you to understand.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:09:37
When you load coindesk and the two prices (one in the title, one on the page) are $1 apart.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:06:21
Hell yeah +25% *today*
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:49:40
Ok thanks, I will go there.

He has a heart?
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:50:35
Nicehash is about mining bitcoin, someone may have experienced the problem before.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:21:48
No, that depends on your gpu -_-
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:33:16
*$40 :(
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:09:38
xD This is verified fact :P

Did... did you read what I wrote?
You still haven't explained any kind of reason it's a scam. If you know of one, please, enlighten me.
So far you seem to be trolling...
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:55:09
In what way is it a scam?
