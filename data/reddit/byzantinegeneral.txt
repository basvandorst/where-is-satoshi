Actually the 'collapse' in Bitcoin has been pretty modest in the light of the Bitfinex news. If it had fallen, or does fall to below $300 I would be worried.
I'd suggest Bitcoin has been resilient when tested in this way. The market is liquid. Other exchanges have held the fort. I am not selling anything. The only thing I am buying is a Trezor Hardware Wallet.

No. The ultimate Bitcoin stimulus is when a fiat currency fails. For example, the Venezuelan Bolivar, the Nigerian Naira.
After that the strongest stimulus is when a currency depreciates very severely, e.g. Ukrainian Hyrvnia.
Negatives rates? No, not a strong stimulus for Bitcoin. New Zealand just cut rates to zero and the NZ dollar appreciated.

My conclusions:
1. I am sceptical about that number of 8 million Blockchain.com Wallet users. I guess at least 7.5 million of them are empty and inactive, or hold a few dollars worth of Bitcoin.
2. Very few people hold enough Bitcoin to justify paying $100 for a Hardware wallet. There is enormous, absurd unequal distribution of wealth amongst Bitcoin holders. A few thousand people own enough Bitcoin to justify spending $100 to protect it.
3. The serious, active Bitcoin user population is much, much smaller than than is implied in the Bitcoin news media.
4. It is indeed a grandly operated ponzi scheme.
I truly hope I am wrong and wish someone could come up with a good counter-argument.

The premium over Net Asset Value will decrease over time as other financial products are created that compete with it.

Just to make explicit the logic behind policy of abolishing cash.
"The Bank of England’s Chief Economist Andrew Haldane on 18th September 2015 raised the possibility that the Bank could abolish use of cash in Britain in order to allow the bank to impose negative interest rates on savers"
1. Economic problem in 2016 is to increase consumption spending to boost Aggregate Demand in the face of falling prices. For when prices are falling consumers defer large purchases in anticipation of buying goods at lower price in the future.
2. Central Bank sets negative interest rates.
3. Consumers are charged interest on money held in bank accounts.
4. Therefore consumers will stockpile cash to avoid paying bank interest. But if they do that policy to increase consumer spending fails.
5. Central Bank abolishes cash. So consumers don't want to hold money in banks, and cannot hold cash, so the only alternative is to spend income.

Bitfinex has two choices:
A) Let the individual owners of the specific Bitcoins that got stolen bear 100% of the losses.
B) Spread the loss out among all users pro rata according to how much they hold at Bitfinex.
It looks like it is chooosing Option B. That is robbing Peter (whose Bitcoin were not stolen) to pay Paul (whose Bitcoin were stolen).
By acting in this way, Bitfinex is stating explicitly to its clients: You Do Not Own Bitcoins Deposited with us. We have autonomy on the use of those Bitcoins.

Purchasing Power Parity theory suggests the USD is over-valued and the CNY is under-valued and therefore the CNY will tend to strengthen against USD.

Devaluation is one problem. But it's generally easier to avoid this problem just by buying hard currencies (Dollar, Euro) than by buying Bitcoin.
A more serious problem is devaluation accompanied by capital controls: see Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe. You can't buy hard currencies. Then Bitcoin can be useful.
Another serious problem is outright confiscation of bank deposits. See Cyprus, and it very nearly happened in Greece. Again Bitcoin is a way to avoid this.

What is the correct price of BitCoin?
For national currencies like the dollar or the Ruble or the Euro the commonest means to measure a currency is the Purchasing Power Parity theory.
Everyone learns this in Economics 101 and the Economist plays around with this idea with its Big Mac Index.
The problem with Bitcoin is you can't measure the PPP valuation of Bitcoin using the The Economist BigMacIndex as there's no country which prices BigMacs in BTC.
So what is the correct value of Bitcoin?
By the way, since the last BigMacIndex was published on 24 July 2014, these currencies have fallen the most:
1 Bitcoin 36.6%
2 Russian Ruble 30%
3 Ukrainian Hryvnia 22%
4 Japanese Yen 14%

@_date: 2015-01-24 14:23:57
Point taken.
The troubles of KTB began long before Spring 2014. Despite being identified by US Ambassador Pardew in Wikileaks as a Bad Apple bank, the state arranged that many state organisations placed their deposits at KTB for several years leading up to 2014. It was on the basis of these state deposits that the fraudulent connected loans were made on a multiplied scale. So the scheme to rob KTB, and at the end of the day the Bulgarian people, was hatched several years ago by Bulgarian politicians.

I'm new to Reddit and don't fully understand  but the bot below makes a point I'd like to reply to.
One of the man questions about Bitcoin is: is it a viable alternative to fiat and banks?
I don't think it is in developed economies, but it is in less developed economies, which tend to be characterised by corrupt banks and by poor regulation of banks. So the grand theft from BTK bank is relevant and in itself the incident provides strong support for the argument for Bitcoin.

That strategy does not protect you from the perils of fractional reserve banking. You and your children still have to cough up higher taxes to pay for interest payments on the national debt that arose from bailing out the banks, even if you live as a hermit paying cash.
In general in an well-ordered society I think fractional reserve banks work quite well. As in the US and Europe from 1945 to mid-80s. 
But in a frontier economy with endemic corruption banks don't work well, as the example of KTB Bank illustrates very well.
And in the developed world the banks' went beyond the original remit from mid-80s with participation in derivatives markets and everyone is paying for the bail-outs now.
@_date: 2015-01-24 14:19:27
The thieves were able to steal $2 billion as a result of two salient features of the bank system that do not apply to Bitcoin.
1. The original capital was placed at the disposal of a central agent (the bank) by depositors. In the decentralised bitcoin system every owner retains control of his own assets.
2. On the basis of KTB Bank's deposits, the bank directors lent out to connected parties $10 for every $1 deposited.
In a non-Fractional Reserve system the losses would be limited to the amount of deposits, perhaps $200 million would have been stolen and not $2 billion.
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:04:08

If Bitcoin was a company, its 'market cap' at the start of 2016 of about $7 billion would have placed it firmly in the S &amp; P 500. The smallest companies in the S &amp; P 500 have market cap of $3 Billion.
Yes countries with economy-specific currencies don't want that sort of appreciation. But Bitcoin, like Gold, is not an economy-specific currency, it is supranational, and its rise does not affect any single economy's terms of trade. That's why its provisional ISO currency code is XBT like Gold's XAG. X being supranational.

I might add that Bitcoin's burn rate - the rate at which a start-up spends its initial capital - is zero because there is no company and no cash invested in that company.

The active users number is way too low.
An analysis of traffic to Bitcoin websites globally shows it to be too heavy by a great deal to be consistent with such a low number.
Select 'Master' tab in the Sheets.
The website traffic to Top 100 Bitcoin sites suggests about 25 million users. 90% of these own tiny amounts of Bitcoin because that is the way of the world. (Google 'Pareto Distribution'.)

@_date: 2017-04-02 14:08:23
25 million owners is an estimate based on site traffic to Top Bitcoin sites. See:
Blockchain.info gets similar or greater traffic than WebMoney (30 million users), Skrill (50 m. users), Venmo (30 m users) etc. And Blockchain is just one of dozens of Bitcoin sites with great internet traffic stats.
About including Bitcoins Lost. It would be easy to integrate this into the derived distribution, But are they lost? A market is developing for verifiable losses at Mt Gox.
Total wealth measured in BTC is the Money Supply.
Total wealth measured in USD is the market cap.

That is indeed the price at Local Bitcoins VE:
Volume = 736 BTC
Volume in VEF = 736 * 5 mill = 3.5 billion VEF
Coin.dance says it's 35 mill.
Either the BTC volume is right, or the VEF volume, but they can't both be right.
Pretty sure BTC volume is right - they just need to correct the y-axis of the VEF chart.

You're right, there are about 25 m. users. It's a Pareto distribution and 90% own very little Bitcoin. The Faucets get very heavy traffic in the third world. Blockchain and Coinbase do not inflate their user count. If anything, Peter Smith is trying to downplay his user numbers in the recent Business Insider piece.

I will explain this again: this has nothing to do with an analysis of wallets and addresses. It is a Pareto distribution of Bitcoin wealth, derived from the distribution of global wealth as reported in the Credit Suisse Wealth Databook 2016. All distributions of wealth naturally evolve to this pattern. The distribution of net wealth in the US, for example, almost exactly mirrors the global distribution of net wealth.

There are two grave problems facing Bitcoin. Combined, they are more serious than the 'threat' of a Hard Fork.
1. The concentration of ownership of Bitcoin
2. The concentration of ownership of flagship Bitcoin companies.
These concentrations expose the entire market to manipulation by the few against the interests of the many.
There is data on the concentrated ownership of Bitcoin here:
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:37:26
No  the distribution is not based on an analysis of Wallets and Addresses. That analysis always hits a brick wall as you suggest. It is the distribution of ownership that applies to all forms of wealth: the Pareto distribution.
It is specifically derived from the distribution of global wealth as reported in the Credit Suisse Wealth Databook, with some adjustment for the coins owned by Satoshi.

The key is the sheer volume of traffic to Bitcoin sites which I have analysed and documented on my site. There is indeed a population of 25 m. Bitcoin owners. But of course the very great majority of them own tiny amounts because such is life and such is the power of the Pareto Principle.

Quantity Theory of Money says:

You're assuming that V = 1, i.e. the Money Supply (the total stock of Bitcoin) has the same value as National Income.
In fact V will be some much larger value and therefore M &lt; PQ and Bitcoin will be worth a lot less than you suggest.

Bitcoin transaction fees = Miners' revenue + Exchanges' revenue
Total miners' revenue = $1.5 million daily x 365 =  $500 million annually
Exchanges' revenue (transaction fees) = 45 BTC daily = $20,000 x 365 = $7 million annually
Total fees paid = miners' revenue + exchanges revenue = $500m + $7m
