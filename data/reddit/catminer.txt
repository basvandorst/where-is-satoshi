This is one of the dumbest fucking things I have ever read and all these comments are retarded. If we as a society are capable enough to become interplanetary, we will not be relying on such crude and primitive ideologies such as money. That is an oxymoron. In order to work at such a scale to become interplanetary, we need vast amounts of resources and energy that no society using money can produce. Systems with money are too inefficient because it causes the brains in the system to direct their energy towards finance (useless production) instead of technological innovation. The only reason why we even have cryptocurrencies is because our financial system is corrupt; and there is no such thing as a non-corrupt system of money because the idea of money is itself corrupt (excluding ancient times when it was necessary to evolve barter in an environment of very scarce resources). There is no good reason why, in our time period let alone the future, to not let go of our economic training wheels and move towards a society where money becomes less and less of a necessity. Until then, we simply don't have the time and energy as a society to achieve the creativity and innovation necessary for interplanetary endeavors.
People here are confused that blockchain tech is futuristic technology... It is not. Blockchain is just a crude technology invented to fight against corruption in our current money system. I mean we already have Hashgraph which makes blockchain obsolete but that's a different discussion. The problem is our system of money, corruption, and bad governance. If we are able to fix these problems, and I think we can with the help of AI, we will eliminate the need for money or at least money in the form that we know it now as a necessity. Only then will we have a society where interplanetary endeavors are realistic. Money is a stupid problem that humans put up with in this time period that robs us of all our intellectual/creative resources. Did someone say interplanetary blockchain? HAHA WOW! That is sad... That is like saying a warp drive starship with rocket engines. NO. When you have a starship capable of warp speed, you don't need rocket propellers. Similarly, when you have a society capable of sustaining itself to the point of efficiency where interplanetary technologies and innovation is being produced successfully, you won't have the inefficiencies of a system such as money.

I don't know anyone. I have no friends and I never talk. Bitcoin is the only thing I know and my reason to live. I love Bitcoin. I will marry Bitcoin. We will have little bitcoin children and we will all go to the zoo to see bitcoins.

This game is so difficult that the time and energy put into solving these riddles may not even be worth 1 BTC. Not to mention, you probably won't win even if you spend all your time on this because you are playing against groups of people. 2 brains is better than 1; well how about like 5 or 10 brains? If you are not working with a team, you stand no chance. There are probably groups of people working together to beat this game, especially since there is $10K+ on the line.
There are also conspiracy theories: The developers know the solution and they worked hard on this game to make a profit. Therefore, they will not just give out/lose 1 BTC. They will take advantage of the situation to make the most profits for themselves. They have an opportunity to give the solution to a friend/insider so they don't lose the BTC. So the devs will profits from the sales of the game on Steam and keep their BTC. Also, the game had a massive update today. What if the devs make changes (updates) to the game whenever someone gets too close to the solution? There are also rumors going around that the game uses your computer to mine BTC in the background.
Given all these reasons, is it still worth it to play this game?

I asked my boss to pay me in BTC. I will now get my salary bi-weekly from unemployment benefits because he fired my fucking ass for asking to be paid in BTC.
