hmmmm.... have you actually tried it?

There is actually very high risk accepting 0 confirmations (easily double-digits probability), fortunately it is reasonably simple to detect it very quickly especially when you use service like blockcypher

But why add feature which is by design making it significantly worse?
If FSS RBF would enforce e.g. "new input has to have age&gt;0" then it would be both reasonably secure (almost on a par what we have today) and it would add the convenience

0conf double-spends are very straightforward to manage and racing double-spend close to impossible to pull if you know what transactions to watch for. Yes there is a risk, but its very small and manageable. 
FSS RBF is awful idea which completely kills accepting 0conf in point of sale use cases and some online cases as well.

the notion I can grab 0age 0fee poorly propagated transaction and add it to the TX as an additional input does not smell like incentive aligned to me, its simply half baked idea gone wild

I feel full RBF is a bit over the top idea, we should not be able to revert anything after its pushed.
I have no issues with FSS RBF, however if the intention is to re-push stacked TX, sure we should limit how the new added input should look like e.g. AGE&gt;0 or FEE&gt;MIN RELAY FEE or LOCKTIME &gt; 0 or ... none of it is in place, I feel FSS RBF was released too fast
yes miners can and should do whatever they wish, but without any INPUT changes I mentioned above, F2Pool will be actually loosing, not winning

that is pretty much the problem today, we don't have simple way for PoS nor online merchants who cannot wait
accepting 0conf is believe or not reasonably acceptable with very low double-spend rate you can manage if you exclude outliers (very happy to pay you bounty for double-spending), FSS RBF is making impossible to catch the outliers and thus makes it trivial to double-spend with double-digits success rate

not trying to insult, try to understand how propagation, peers behavior, relay fee and different versions work. Look at the network as a whole and overall behavior
if you understand the peers behavior then you really understand how racing double-spend is so simple to pull
Finney Attack is totally different story, I am not saying that is simple unless you are large pool operator or try known tricks like using eligius blacklist
