Fellow bitcoiner and Trump supporter from across the sea.
Was there a specific thing said that made the spastic spray you?
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:02:17
There are plenty of sites out there that will give you micro amounts for surveys, watching videos etc but the amount will not make a noticeable bump to your income. I have a few reviews up for faucets in if you wanted to looks, they are compeltely free but small amounts (roughly 1-3c USD per click every 10 mins on my fav one).
I have started bitcoin investing and so far it is much better and more profitable. Of course the risk is always there though.
If you would like more info, feel free to PM me.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:48:58
No reason? You could literally google "bitcoin to usd converter" but instead you ask a dumb question. I'm annoyed that people want to get into the crypto market and make all this money but are too fucking lazy to do any fucking research or work.
Do you realise currently profits are made a LOT from people EXACTLY like you. 0 knowledge, 0 research, 100% lazy and just wanting to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:12:29
I've never lost my phone and gone onto reddit to try solve the fucking mystery for me.
You literally have 0 logic, 0 reasoning and 0 ability to problem solve. Conversation over.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:32:52
Do you realise that 'nother' is not actually a word?
Clearly your intellect is "just too superior" to mine. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:59:03
I am aware people don't. The difference is the people with shit grammar don't usually try take the "my intellect is better" approach like you did.
@_date: 2017-01-11 04:45:37
I can pay my bills with bitcoin so as far as I'm concerned it's real money.
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:46:27
according to the past "waves" it should go down then spike up in a big way based off the last 2 "waves"
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:18:35
use the sidebar?
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:10:09
Not if you have it backed up correctly.
No one can hack your wallet, only you can LOSE it.
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:30:23
I assume people who are viewing this or having input have the general clue that at any point bitcoin could crash, I also assumed I wouldn't have to point that out.
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:39:48
That's entirely possible and I am not pretending to know everything that's going to happen. I just read a really informative article that went really in depth regarding the 2 "waves" that have already happened. I am basing it off that model continuing (which it has for a few years now).
That being said, there is every chance bitcoin could completely die at any given time, I am just hedging my bets that it will survive.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:51:55
You are assuming I wouldn't say it to their face, I gladly would and stick by it.
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:24:41
Bitcoin does not NEED a huge influx of new money. Holy fuck you're spreading complete horse shit.
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:04:46
Your question is literally basic maths. Let me explain (I'll round your bitcoin up for ease of explanation) - you have 0.05BTC currently. By googling BTC TO USD I found coindesk straight away ( which tells me 0.005 is about $23.38USD. I can then, using simple maths do an equation like this:
0.005 x (BTC PRICE I AM WANTING TO CHECK) and get a value for any price BTC goes to.
Like I said, basic fucking 2nd grade maths gives you this result. **Like I said before, you're just fucking too lazy to do 1 simple maths equation** and you proved my point.

Well mr. smart ass on mobile if you click the top right and click "community info" it is the same as the sidebar. My point is common sense is not being used and we shouldn't have to pander to it.

@_date: 2017-08-30 04:26:27
It has nothing to do with me already knowing it. See, you literally can't grasp what I am saying. I said that every new person comes here and asks the same fucking thing without ever doing any research which to me **equals lazy**. Holy fuck I can't converse with you anymore you are dragging me down to your IQ level and beating me with experience.
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:40:18


Wrong on so many levels.
Have you ever used BTC before? Any crypto? 
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:10:50
It's not a scam, I have been using it for a few weeks now. I have proof of payment and now have my deposits on 100% compounding interest.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:54:33

@_date: 2017-08-31 03:06:24
Why the fuck would a Trump impeachment (which has no basis) make the price go up? Have you been in crypto long?
Yes, I personally think bitcoin will hit highs above 100k per coin within 5-10 years. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:05:24
Because China wants to be THE superpower. It would make sense down the road to do something like that and force the adoption but it is way to fragile and early to do it yet, even with their market share.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:33:58
Bitsea is currently paying instantly. I am in no way affiliated with them but I do use them.
I have so far invested like $25 and today deposited $90. The interest does pay out and so far the site is operating fantastic.

Well I assumed that you cannot capitalise letters at the start of a sentence, which you proved me right. I assumed you couldn't do a basic multiplication, which again, I was correct. I also assumed that you have the severe lack of brain power not to be able to google search your required outcome, again I was right. So please, do explain where you "showed me".

1) Do NOT cloud mine

4) way more than your budget is
3) buy your budget, not mine
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:25:49
1. 
2. Depends on the exchange. I deposited for first time in bittrex last night took about 20 mins to confirm. Kraken took about 3 mins. Coinbase about 2 mins.
3. No.
4. Keep the paper in a safe somewhere and use your breadwallet as normal ( i too use breadwallet). In the case of emergency then use your paper.

Use the sidebar that exists in every single fucking sub on reddit. my god.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:01:13
I could tell you the value of your bitcoin without looking it up. I buy and sell, trade and play around with it daily. I was like you once but I actually though "hey, I like this I might go and learn about it". I went and did a lot of research and reading. I then asked MEANINGFUL questions to the bitcoin community. You are literally asking how to count your tiny profits. You are after a money grab while I believe that bitcoin IS the future of currency.
There is a side bar on reddit that literally has everything you need.
Do you think there hasn't been a 1000 other people ask the same shit? My problem is not your question but the fact that you (appear to) refuse to use your brain and want others to work everything out for you.

@_date: 2017-08-16 23:45:41
Your thinking is off from the beginning. Bitcoin doesn't want to replace anything. Bitcoin wants to bring the ability for anyone to send a value (cash, currency, whatever you want to call it) to any other person anywhere on the planet instantly without the need for any intermediaries. Bitcoin's concept does NOT need to replace anything, it has it's own value which will continue exisiting even if all the fiat one's collapse.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:16:56
Understanding why bitcoin was invented and it's purpose is the number 1 thing new comers need to research. Most new comers think that bitcoin is a 'throw some money in it, leave it, buy a lambo' kind of scheme. This is why I personally get very angry. I see the future of bitcoin, the use for so many people, removing intermediaries etc.
When a newbie comes in talking about making all this money without knowing the tech and vision behind bitcoin that's when I will meet them with anger. Asking valid questions is fine, coming in expecting someone to explain everything without ever looking at anything is fucking stupid.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:18:02
I understood it fine which is why I also gave you said equation. I just wanted you to know how dumb you are in the process hopefully saving another mind numbing question from you in the future.

A Satoshi is the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin that can currently be sent: 0.00000001 BTC, that is, a hundredth of a millionth BTC. In the future, however, the protocol may be updated to allow further subdivisions, should they be needed.
Further examples of units
1 BTC = 1,000 mBTC (millibitcoin)
1 BTC = 1,000,000 μBTC (microbitcoin)
1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis
1 mBTC = 100,000 Satoshis
1 μBTC (microbitcoin) = 100 Satoshis

Well, first off, vice is a piece of shit lying news source so it makes perfect sense they want to talk shit about Bitcoin, they have for years.

No because from time to time greedy fuck wits like ver and jihad will try attack bitcoin, this is exactly what is happening. They move their centralised mining pools away to try force bitcoin. This all happened as a result of 2x failing spectacularly. Not hard to put 2+2 together except, seemingly, for you.

If you invested in Microsoft when the internet was beginning it is a very, very similar situation now. Or if you invested in Facebook in 2008 which is now used by nearly everyone in the developed world. These stories are not different (apart from being centralised companies), it is how new tech takes off and changes the world, like Bitcoin will do. It's ok to be short sighted and not see the potential of Bitcoin but don't spread bullshit about it being a bubble. Does that mean Paypal is a bubble since Bitcoin has a highest market share?

It's worse than a shitty coin, it's a shitty coin trying to pass itself as the 'real' bitcoin. Pathetic cunts trying to muddy the waters to make some money. Disgusting scum support bch, monopolists jihad wu and convicted felons like fuckwit Ver. 
TL:DR - "While engaging in the business of selling explosive devices, Mr. Ver stored the explosives in a residential apartment building and mailed the devices via the United States Mail in a manner contrary to Postal Service regulations. Judge Fogel sentenced the Defendant to 10 months in federal prison, a fine of $2,000, as well as a three-year period of supervised release."

@_date: 2017-11-01 23:12:37
Never once did I allude to bitcoin being more widely accepted than bank transfers so please do not put words in my mouth. Bitcoin's "killer use-case" is people holding their own money, not relying on anyone, being able to send value to anyone anywhere in the world instantly without an intermediary. It is literally saving thousands of Venezuelans as their currency has nose dived. It's is so ignorant and short sighted to ignore all of this and try get into semantics about bitcoin transfer speed.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:28:32
Name just 1 completely unattackable system that exists, I'll wait. Banks get attacked. Governments get hacked. Fuck me, even the FBI gets hacked. But no, bitcoin can't be attacked or it doesn't work is pretty much what you're saying. So fucking dumb.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:22:11
$10 tx fees are because Jihad wu and ver the convicted felon both tried attacking Bitcoin and forking it. The B2X shit storm failed so they moved to the next thing, swinging all their hashing power to BCH to try again, attack bitcoin. Now during all this they proceeded to spam the mempool with small transactions. So now, here we are, those 2 attacks gone and the tx spamming continuing but not having much effect. If you cannot see how jihad and ver are creating a monopoly then you deserve to lose whatever you invest. Bitcoin has no owner, no controller. Bitcoin follows the market, follows the people. This is why bitcoin will change the world, not just make people money.

First point - correct.
Second point - not exactly. Even if the bank transfer is instant (if you have transferred to them before etc) to you, the bank side still takes DAYS to clear due to their out dated algorithms. No wonder the banks want blockchain tech so bad.
Bitcoin is faster than any current fiat system. Only trade of physical assets in person is quicker - i.e gold, cash. but they have their inherent risks (getting robbed).
While Bitcoin is not perfect, it is a GIANT leap forward from the current in many ways, speed being a main one.

What you need yo understand is that you are fully capable of running your own full node. There are plenty of wallets that do custom fees you literally just need to go to the sidebar link on wallets.

You saying this proves that you are either heavily invested into 2x bullshit or a paid shill. 
There is literally 0 evidence pointing to needing bigger blocks, this debates rages fiercely every day in the crypto world. There are solutions that can be implemented AFTER being tested first. Yeah, let's just go to bigger blocks with no fucking idea what could happen...derp derp.

It doesn't make sense because BCH is a separate coin, not affiliated with bitcoin in the slightest other than taking part of the name and cloning the chain. BCH can be manipulated by the big miners but if you want to think it's because BCH is taking off, prove it - go invest in BCH I'll wait.

Too many factors to explain. Just because you think you put a high enough fee, doesn't make it so. There is a lot of volatility currently. Transactions of mine personally take between 2 hours - 2 days currently. Until the fork is over and things settle down, expect longer delays.

@_date: 2017-11-08 23:41:33
Fees are related to the SIZE of the transaction (inputs and outputs) not the amount. If you have a small transaction i.e. 1 input and 1 output you could send any amount for the same fee. Your $6 for $1 would have also been $6 for $1,000,000 assuming same inputs and outputs.

99% of bitcoin transactions, are effectively instantaneous, as far as the consumer is concerned. Works both ways. While you may check it and it's gone how about get out of your selfish little view point and maybe have a look from a BUSINESS side? Business is WAY quicker than banks to settle transactions - no if's but's or maybe's.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:57:24
No, you are completely fucking wrong. Miners care about profits, has nothing to do with the users.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:11:48
Well let's see. 
- I open my bitcoin app and send you bitcoin
- It uses my data sending to blockchain
- A **MINER** validates the transaction and includes it into the next block
- Generally** after 1 confirmation you will receive the funds, sometimes quicker, sometimes slower.
All of the energy except some data is literally from the miner. What energy do I use?

I recently had this discussion with my parents. Both in their 60's and nearly completely tech illiterate. My mum still has no idea and thinks it is a digital "share" kind of thing. However, I was able to explain some of the basics to my dad and get it through in lamans terms. The technology itself is not difficult to explain but explaining it in a way other generations can understand is the real issue. Trying to put into words what it is and how it works seems like the biggest thing.
My tip to anyone trying to explain to someone who knows nothing and aren't sure how it applies is this:
1. BTC can be sent instantly anywhere to anyone in the world without **ANY** intermediaries.
2. The application currently is not as needed in the developed world as it is in 3rd world countries (e.g. Venezuela). My example here is a farmer being able to sell their products and receive money in BTC even though the Venezuelan currency is useless.
3. You don't have banks or anyone else saying you can't transfer because "that part of the world is not safe" further pushing the divide between the extremely poor and western worlds.
4. You and only you are responsible for your money.
5. Fuck banks.

You forget your own statements now, cute.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:20:03
You can hack an exchange or a computer to steal some but to steal the actual bitcoin without accessing a third party site or computer? Can't happen.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:58:15
It's better than you :)
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:22:10
Yes, I use Breadwallet. It gives you control of your private key. Coinbase has the private keys, it is just an exchange. I have never left coins on Coinbase longer than 30 seconds. My advice - use breadwallet or hardware wallet and **never leave them in coinbase, EVER**
November is the plan, if it goes ahead. Jeff the fuckwit is now pushing metronome more than his 2x shitcoin so time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:05:18


Please show me a predecessor of Bitcoin, which you can pull "generally good" historical advice from...I'll wait...


Define "getting into it"...I'll wait...hint - it differs for every single fucking person


Do you enjoy pretending to know things?
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:48:28
Breadwallet is NOT a hardware wallet. Trazor, Ledger Nano are hardware wallets. Once the fork happens, someone will make a compatible wallet etc. With the bcash fork Breadwallet had a single button which was "send BCH" and I sent it to bittrex and sold immediately.
It's impossible to say what coinbase will do until it happens. They could not support it at all or support it but either way the forked coins **will** exist.

The title is FUD and a lie, I was directed here by a specific FUD article. How about **before** talking about a topic, you actually fucking read it.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:49:11
I buy through amazon currently with bitcoin using purse.io, amazon still gets paid regardless.
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:31:20
Actually, if you could count, it is 7 unique logins and essentially means nothing in the context you provide. All the shit you are saying you cannot back up. I am calling bullshit and not responding to you anymore. Karmawhore
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:22:11
Why would you comment like you know anything when you're too fucking lazy to read an article. Stupid karma whoring retard
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:45:56


Well, I found where you are going wrong. Bitcoin is about controlling your own wealth, no intermediaries, no one else involved but **YOU** - Decentralisation 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:54:35
Way too slow? Have you seen how long it takes to do a bank transfer or for a CC payment to clear? Bitcoin is by no means **SLOW**. Fucking FUD
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:18:12
Did you even read the article **YOU** linked?


"A contractor", written in plain English. Fuck you are so dumb.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:13:27
Yet you completely disregard how many of those 352 address's are EXCHANGES HOLDING USERS/TRADERS COIN. Holy fuck the FUD you spread is cancerous.
Edit: Check the top 10 bitcoin wallets in the world. You can fucking see it's exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:08:25
YOU and only YOU made the claim of "users on Reddit aren't fucking spending it." You are so brain dead you forgot the bullshit statement you made.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:50:59
And you clearly didn't read that the advice is that it is **NOT** too late.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:47:24
Cross-site attack sounds like you put your Bitcoin is a shady website without diligence and got owned for it. Either way, your fault.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:20:05
Keep fantasising 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:42:50
Again, until bitcoin (in amazons eyes) is "stable enough" I can't see them widely adopting it in the biggest business on the planet.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:00:08
It's a good idea in your mind maybe. Are all those people who saw bitcoin for what it is and went all in wrong? Coz according to you the good idea is 3-10%, nothing more. Stop fucking giving advice to people when you have literally no clue what a good amount is for them.
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:27:40
A dick for calling out a liar? Yeah, ok, keep believing retards.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:28:08
Not once have I ever given advice, only you have. I just easily point out how full of shit you are. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:17:38
Go look up dollar cost averaging. Buy a little at a set time regardless of price. I have part of my salary paid in bitcoin every fortnight, regardless of btc's current price. It's fun.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:19:51
Tell me, since we are discussing CRYPTOCURRENCY, **WHAT IS CRYPTO MADE OF**? so fucking dumb. you literally want to fight for the sake of fighting.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:38:50
I never said anything to the contrary. I am pointing out that you saying 'it was just mtgox hack.' is fucking dumb. It is the biggest crypto hack in the history of crypto but to you it's "just a hack'. ROFL. So easy to spot casuals who spread FUD
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:16:37
Transactions don't just "disappear", wtf is wrong with you?
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:04:17
Have a look at how crypto is helping Venezuela after their currency collapsed. This will SHOW you the first world use. Farmer to buyer without an intermediary. If you tried to send Bitcoin from USA to Uganda, most likely it will be blocked. Good luck blocking a Bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:21:04
I love watching people spreading shit get owned by posts like this. Thank you @_date: 2017-09-21 22:37:09
Not scary for everyone outside of China.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:57:38
FUD and more FUD. You are invested 6 figures but calling it a bubble? GTFO you liar.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:43:42
It's dumb. I have used wallets for 5 years and **NEVER ONCE LOST ANY OF IT**. So, again, you are dumb.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:02:28
Kim dot com has a better reputation than you ever will. Why would I ever believe you over him?
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:48:46
I'm on reddit and I spend Bitcoin so you are already a liar.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:55:19


Above is **YOUR** fucking claim. I proved it wrong, **THE AMOUNT IS 100% IRRELEVANT TO YOUR STATEMENT**. Holy fuck, the mental gymnastics you must do to spew the garbage you do...
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:10:59
YOU MEAN THERE IS A WEBSITE WHERE I CAN DOUBLE MY MONEY IN 24 HOURS? LET ME SEND MY LIFE SAVINGS TO THEM, SOUNDS LEGIT!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:15:00
Yes, move it off asap. Coinbase have flip flopped their position regarding the fork within 24 hours. Hardware wallet best. I use breadwallet on iphone as I control private key. I also have a paper wallet in the safe in my bedroom. Can never be too safe.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:57:49
I am well aware that people, in general, talk a lot of shit. This has literally nothing to do with Bitcoin. You are trying to make a case that because people say things and they don't come true that Bitcoin will not grow fast? Fuck me dead your logic is astounding.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:44:40


You must be new or you just haven't even looked. There are fucking heaps of options.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:20:55
Anyone who gives you an answer to this question legit knows fucking nothing. No one can predict it. Sit down, buckle up and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:01:43
People said bitcoin would never reach Paypals market cap either, see what happened there on August 14th 2017? Ignorant people like you are the ones that always miss out so I am happy.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:13:27
Yeah, all I have seen the last few days since BTC-e is fear mongering and bashing ALL exchanges. They happen to provide a service that is not easily attainable elsewhere. They have streamlined the process so well that I can have crypto in my own wallets within 30 minutes of signing up. What a time to be alive :) to the moon....
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:11:59
Before you can claim that vegan food will reduce the rate of global warming (which is one of the fucking dumbest things I've ever heard), can you please provide evidence that humans have impacted the already known natural cycle of earths warming and cooling? 
Feel free to google it, research, do whatever you want - the proof doesn't exist.
So take your lies and your fucking shitty diet out of here. Fun fact - a town in Italy want to make it a criminal offence for a parent to feed their kids a vegan diet (google: savino law). There is justice in the world!
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:50:20
I can bpay any bills/rent, cash out instantly to bitcoin atm's. 
Bitcoin can be used exclusively to live off, quite easily these days.
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:36:30
Did I deny climate change or did I say that the earth has a natural cycle of cooling and warming that has existed since before humans?
I do not ever deny climate change. I point out that scientists have literally LIED about humans effect on climate change. Still not a single scientist in the history of the planet is able to provide proof that humans have in any way/shape/form affected the ALREADY OCCURRING NATURAL CYCLE
I don't expect a fucking retard who can't read and jumps to "climate change denier" to have any form of intelligence for a debate so continue on your way you uneducated sheep.
If anyone wants to read about scientists lying to get grants from the gov, here you go:
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:27:06
So informative and helpful. Good to see people like you contributing to spread Bitcoin to others.
Or in lamans terms: You're a fuck wit, get off your soap box - everyone started somewhere.
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:26:17
Exactly. It's like people forget that to trade shares you have to put up cash but putting up cash to trade bitcoin? NO FUCKING WAY. So ironic.
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:11:37
What about if I bought a small amount at the dip yesterday, why should I cash out immediately?
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:54:25
Says I pay 3.99% but I can prove to you anytime that I paid way less than that % so...
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:19:03
He has got more right, credible information out to the public than you , no?
I see a hateful person shitting on someone because you don't like them lol. Completely derailing what the post is about fucking shill.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:18:01
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:20:27
I think you missed the "WHY". I have bitcoin in my wallet but also a little on the exchange to trade/play with. So again, WHY should I cash out immediately? I am trying to get rid of the bullshit fear mongering going on here.
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:49:44
iOS - Breadwallet
Anything else - do your research

I'd rather listen to him than listen to you lol pessimist much? hateful much? angry much? delusional much? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:52:36
You missed the entire point of my sarcastic post clearly. I'm very well aware of the pros and cons. People talking about BTC exchanges getting hacked like they are the only exchanges that can be hacked and it is making new people doubt and shy away from a secure, decentralised currency system. People fear mongering and putting out bullshit is NOT what we need. Wall street could get hacked but I don't see thread after fucking thread about cashing out of wall street now do i?
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:30:33
Would not have a clue how that works.
I just know that I buy and sell BTC and never have to report a thing, works for me.
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:52:27
1 coin would be doing good...perspective.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:37:26
Your mistake is paying tax's to the corporations for a decentralised currency. Jokes on you m8.
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:23:18
Coinbase has the option when you put your buy order in, you can tick the check box and select how often you want it re-ordered.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:43:16
Yes, Europe has MANY BTC atm's, have a look - 
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:50:31
Coinbase. I bought yesterday $1.49 flat fee
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:53:44
We are told that the Earth is getting hotter and hotter every year. We believe it without question, but why?
When a climate study is cancelled due to TOO MUCH ICE, what then?
Second best ice breaking ship in the country couldn't break through the ice? But again, please tell me how there is no ice left, it's all melting away and we are doomed. Please, go on.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:45:34
^ This
I signed up for coinbase 2 days ago. ID verified in 5 minutes. In 15 minutes I had bought some BTC, LTC and ETH then moved them to my wallet (luckily I bought the dip).
Coinbase have been fantastic notifying people about their intentions. I do not intend to use BCC at all, even if it's worth something. I'm old school and sticking with BTC. I vouched for BTC to all my friends and co-workers, I'm ALL IN. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:15:28
If BCC splits they have the opportunity to rip off everyone's BTC (look up replay attack). Be very careful.
It's too early to predict what will happen. Sit back, HODL and wait for the storm to pass. Then we pick up and keep moving.
