Now we just need the butterfly labs site to go offline and we can move on.

You just bought me lunch. Thanks for being awesome. I hear racing stripes add at least 45 TH/s

Everyone is freaking out and I'm posting relevant braveheart memes. You guys... I'm killing it right now!

I agree. Shame this is the 2nd time its gone down in the last 2 weeks. I'll keep mining there for sure.

Not knocking him or the site by any means. Just wanted everyone to know what's up. I know I personally check reddit more than bitcointalk :)

I agree with the red flags and it does seem fishy. That's an awful lot of trouble to go through for a scam. Domain registration, ssl cert, etc. Domain was purchased back in March according to whois info. The phone number used to belong to Littlefield's Tree Service in South Carolina

How Many Jiggananners does it get?
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:29:36
In all seriousness... yes it would. Rasberry PI + this+ 60 watt solar kit = SolarMiner that will likely take 1 year to see ROI. Would be fun though, just not terribly practical.

Cgminer has been my goto for a while. Only get 285mhs out of each card that way. That's with intesity at 14 on all cards and same OC settings I have in msi afterburner. I tried guiminer for the heck of it and got the results in the screenshot. These are the only cards I've seen where cgminer has not been the best option. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 17:52:27
thanks for tip. Will consider that for sure.

Thanks sir/maam. Housing is made of unobtainium. Not sure if you've heard of it before, but its really rare. I have a few platters on order from my vendor , but he's taking too long so I'm switching to a new guy. After that the platters are going to the bumping facility, then to the swatting facility, then to extraction. I'm sure you don't know how all this works, but its going to take about another 24 months.
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:57:17
I don't think they are scamming people...just think they are bad at business/customer service. Clearly their products exist. Just taking them forever.

"What did the sea say to the shore? -- Long time, no sea!"
Also, sorry for your troubled week. Just know that you are on a giant spaceship with a bunch of other travelers hurtling through space. We are all in this together. Also, your body emits visible light in the form of photons. Those travel at the speed of light in every direction for all time. That means photons you emitted 10 years ago are now 10 light years into space. I've had too much coffee this morning. 
Plz don't send me bitcoin. Just don't like seeing people sad.

@_date: 2013-05-08 13:11:57
Its worth noting. The reason I'm even considering it is to give folks something they can move on now if they want to get into mining... instead of waiting for ASICs to ship etc.

Yea I saw that. Not terribly happy about it. I think everyone will get their units eventually. I certainly won't be a repeat customer.
@_date: 2013-06-03 19:04:10
i have not. I've had them running like that for a month without any problem. Any reason to give them more juice?
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:32:40
Total cost was $900. Should net ฿1.64 ($196 usd with bitcoin at the current $119 exchange rate) per month for current difficulty. ROI would be 4-5 months. ZERO electricity cost currently (employer allows me to leave it under my desk because he's a nice guy). As ASIC batches ship and come online the difficulty will go up obviously and my income from this rig will go down. I have a BFL Jally 7ghs on order and 1ghs on order from cloudhashing. Should be running at 9.3gh/s by end of summer. I should be able to maintain that 1.64ish btc per month profit for a bit.

I'm already shipping 40,000 a day. You guys have seen the difficulty going up right?

WAIT... YOU MEAN THIS STUFF THAT I USE TO BUY THINGS IS A CURRENCY?! I THOUGHT CRYPOCURRENCY WAS JUST A METAPHOR! MY CAPS LOCK IS STUCK.
@_date: 2013-05-08 14:48:53
This is what I get out of it.  Its feasible for right now, but basically becomes bad idea if the difficulty increases too much. So if BFL actually starts shipping this becomes a bad move. If they continue to delay its not bad. I think I can cut some corners and get some more hashing power out of the rig I've spec'd out and decrease the cost some.
@_date: 2013-07-18 11:55:54
Fun fact: I was looking through  posts on instagram last night and saw your screenshot. I remember thinking "that's enough of the key showing for bad things to happen"... and now here we are. Small world is small. Best of luck with your 1plazmo vanity search good sir.
@_date: 2013-05-08 14:02:16
Thanks for the breakdown. That makes much more sense. Gives me more math to do and determine if I can provide more hashing power for less $.
@_date: 2013-07-10 17:26:00
Agree with them being mostly GPU mining folks. I'd be out if it weren't for the fact that I get the power for free because my employer is awesome. Will continue mining with my tiny 1.3ghs until my asic units arrive. I'd switch to litecoin as I know its more profitable but I don't want to have to fool with yet another currency I need to exchange when all I'm interested in is BTC :)
@_date: 2013-06-03 19:10:06
Lovely. I expect the decrease in profits so I'm not too surprised. If I had to pay for the power to run the rig It would definitely be a huge bummer.

on AMD 2.8 SDK. I'll definitely tweak it more and see if I can get cgminer working properly. Just want it mining for a day in current state to ensure all 4 cards get along together. This was 2 rigs until this morning.
