Forgive me since I've been out of the loop for a few years since gpu mining became infeasible, but surely maintaining the current cap of 5 transactions/sec will directly impact bitcoins adoption. People keep saying that want to use bitcoin instead of something like visa/all other payment providers, but visa alone manages on the order of thousands of transactions per second. For replacing all payments we probably need more like tens of thousands of transactions. People are either going to have to pay incredible fees the likes of which make bitcoin more expensive than traditional payment or wait days. 
Edit: I have just read up on segregated witness, I don't know what to think now.

I got into mining early, mined 4000 BTC, sold them all for &lt;$2 :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:38:32
Use Bitstamp and transferwise. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:42:39
Sadly, &lt;$2 does not mean $2. But I made a profit on my mining hardware - 5870's shot up in price and I sold most of them for double what I paid. More money was made by later buying bitcoins at $20 and selling them at £20 (arbitrage). Then I gambled and bought loads at $30, panicked when they dropped and sold at $20 :(
Edit: Also lost 30 BTC to mybitcoin. Sigh, why did I have to remember that.
@_date: 2013-05-04 10:16:21
Why not both/all?

Not so great if you are trying to sell. I was lucky and managed to sell merely an hour after the problems started at $190 and still made a profit. I had to try several hundred times before I managed to get through - and thank god I did. Had it been working I would have been able to sell at $220.
I would agree that it (seems) safe and apart from the panic selling scaling failiure (which is pretty huge, imo) they are fantastic. I still recommend them over MtGox.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:28:05
I think the main reason is it has so little volume compared to bigger exchanges so didn't get hammered as much.
@_date: 2013-04-27 19:47:45
Yes, you're right. Bitcoin could suddenly be worth next to nothing at some point, especially if governments try and make it illegal/try to stop it (even though this will fail to stop bitcoin transactions it would destroy the exchanges). The UK government seems particularly unfavorable towards bitcoin, for example. With fiat backed by a strong country like Japan (despite all their past and current economic problems they are still the country with the 4th highest GDP (PPP)) it could drop in value but is unlikely to collapse completely.
tl;dr: Bitcoin is riskier and may make you much, much richer or much, much poorer. Yen will make you very slightly poorer.

For god's sake don't put all your money into bitcoin. Bitcoin should be treated like an investment and the number 1 rule of investment is "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose".
Also, don't take specific investment advice from this subreddit.

Everything gets converted to USD. My experience of Bitstamp has been great (so far).
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:15:54
The real problem is getting your money out of Bitstamp, considering most UK banks don't support SEPA deposits.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:05:12
HSBC is one of the few that do support it :)

All UK banks can have money transferred into then via SEPA (although you may have a very poor conversion rate). It's transferring the money out via SEPA that's often the problem.

At this point, bitcoin is an investing. The two most important rules of investment are:
1) Don't invest more than you can afford in risky investments 
2) Diversify your investments
I feel this is a very foolish idea, you'd be better investing what you could afford to lose of this money in a selection of funds to diversity. I hope you are at least using an offline wallet/cold storage. It would be so easy to lose everything.

[Bitstamp]( supports two factor authentication using Google Authenticator and is awesome. Free SEPA deposits, cheap SEPA withdrawals. May not be so useful outside Europe.

1.4 million in unrealised gains. That could go down to nothing overnight. Don't forget the capital gains tax you have to pay on it too if you convert it to your home currency.

Yeah, my thoughts exactly. The moment his bank account starts increasingly rapidly he will get checked and forced to pay. If he doesn't, he will get fucked some point in the future. Even so, with 28% capital gains tax that's still ~$700,000.

I actually had an arbitrage bot going a while back (until the lag made it unfeasible too much of the time) - the -0.1% fee was really great when moving BTC from bitfloor to another exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:06:24
TBH the main reason I use Bitstamp is it is the only place I can get money into and out of reliably (living in Europe) and doesn't have huge deposit/withdrawal fees (free SEPA in, 90 cents SEPA out).
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:31:21
Just use blockchain.info wallets with good backups - while blockchain.info still exists you don't need to download the blockchain and if they cease to exist then you can just resort to using the client on your computer.

Bitstamp can't take any of the panic selling traffic. Site was down (completely down) for 4 hours on the 10th. [Here is a chart showing the patch where it went down again today]( Sadly the outage on the 10th is too long ago to see on bitcoinity.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:10:10
It went down to *$70*, hot damn.

@_date: 2013-04-11 02:28:45
The only big exchange that didn't have a complete "site is shutdown" error is mtgox. The lag was unacceptable but Bitstamp and Bitfloor were both inaccessible for much of the time.
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:32:38

No (sane) person will use paypal to sell you bitcoins. You can reverse the transaction at the touch of a button and get your money back with no way for them to dispute it and you have their bitcoins irreversibly sent to you. Use the bitcointip redeem karam function to get a fee mBTC.

As someone who has seen the dark depths of coding in the banking industry, I can assure that there are bugs in the software produced, they are not open source and so go seriously wrong without anyone realising for ages causing the bank to lose millions of dollars/mischarge customers/something terrible. The bank usually hushes it up and fixes it. All software has bugs, just because bitcoin software has bugs does not necessarily mean it's going to fail.

@_date: 2013-04-16 14:11:03
I've tried and it's sadly impractical. You have to take into account the fees on each side, you can't move fiat or even BTC fast enough between exchanges. You can keep a balance on each exchange and wait for the exchanges to switch places but the lag is a serious problem and if a trade fails on once side you've got just as much risk as normal investing. To make any real money you need to use a lot a once which increases the risk and often there isn't enough asks or bids at that price to fulfil your demand. By the time you've checked they've probably gone. 
If you're writing bots to do this then the largest price gaps are when the lag is huge and Bitstamp is down so you'll probably lose money unless you account for that. 
It's not worth it - you can tell because the price difference is still there. The people building arbitrage bots like me haven't found a way to make it work and equalise the markets.

I was actually wondering this, but even when I was playing around with a large 10GB container on an old 5400rpm spinny disk years ago it can't have written it all out again as that would have taken a long time and it would not be able to hold it all in ram as I only had 1Gb of it. I seem to remember there was an attack on truecrypt where by observing changes in container you could gain information about the size of the files being changed repeatedly inside it; this suggests they encrypt it in separate blocks or some similar scheme.

The point of bitcoin is there is no control and there are no regulators - and you want to throw all that away and make the exchanges become our regulators?
