if you're using windows 8:
{drive}\{user}\AppData\Roaming\Jaxx\Local Storage\
and remove the files in there.

the crypto library we use is on the JS side of things, to keep it unified across our implementations.

That's a good point, we'll look into windows and osx app store releases :) The initial versions might be direct download :)

re: Cordova, it's very similar in terms of our approach. We have a very thin (camera access, JS call forwarding) application layer on the Android and IOS side of things. This wraps our JS codebase, which does all the wallet-side things.

Different standards: ECIES was proposed in 2001, PGP has been around since 1991.
To quote wikipedia: "it is thought to be the most widely chosen quality cryptographic system"

Our ethereum addresses are using the same HD mechanism as our bitcoin side of things. So your master seed (+pin/etc when we implement that aspect) is in charge of generating your initial wallet, and in the future when you've sent a new transaction your address will change.
We're currently using lightwallet's open source code ( from ConcenSys) to generate the HD ethereum addresses &amp; associated private/public keypairs for signing.
regarding payment statuses, we're using etherscan.io as our endpoint for sending and updating.

or you can right click and inspect chrome source of Jaxx.
all of these options require you to be able to read code, none of them deal with any potential vulnerabilities in the third party libraries, of which we've found a few ourselves and done pull requests on other people's libraries over the past year.
