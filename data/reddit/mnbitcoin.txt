Are there any proposed changes to miners?

Is there a way to do that in Mycelium on Android?

I set it up on a Windows server. How do I enter commands like getpeerinfo?

That's a good point I hadn't considered. I was thinking KryptoKit might be a temporary workaround until the W3C comes up with a browser standard. Perhaps the right answer to the multi-device problem is to price it so low that most people just don't care.

Just curious what the explanation is for dropping the warranty period down from 90 days to 30 days. It seems like with all the problems people been having you should be going the other way and extend it.

This must be old. They mentioned a current price of $800

Seems legit to me

Just out of curiosity, does anyone that received any of these dust transactions buy or sell on localbitcoins.com?

Are the source Photoshop or Illustrator (or some other hi-res format) files available for download?  I'd like to print off a few of these for distribution.

Is there any way to speed up the syncing?  I wonder if torrenting it would be a faster way to start?

They have a great beer selection too!

It looks like they are only accepting bitcoin for full subscriptions. I've been wanting to see a major newspaper come up with a paywall that does micro transactions. $0.10 per article or something like that. I thought maybe that was why Bezos bought a newspaper.

I get a certain amount of free Azure resources every month for being a Microsoft partner so this shouldn't cost me anything.  I'm not using it for anything else so I figured I might as well pop up a couple extra nodes.

This. Not only do I love Bacon, but Bacon Reader is one of my favorite apps. I actually prefer Bacon Reader over Reddit on my PC. Is that weird?

RoboForm has the best interface, works on all platforms (Windows, Linux, Android etc) and is the easiest to use but costs money if you want to sync across devices.  LastPass is a really good free alternative. KeePass is good too, especially if you have an Amazon S3 account for syncing across devices.

Did you ever get your coins back?

The difficulty increase today was over 10%.  That's significantly higher than the previous two increases.  The next difficulty increase is on pace to be even bigger.  Has this decline in the hash rate already been reflected?

I've use the unregistered mIRC on a Windows box for years. I'd gladly register it if they started accepting Bitcoin.

I run 3 nodes. All on Ubuntu desktop vm's; home, work, and one on Azure. I'm great at Windows but suck at Linux. What should I do? (command by command instructions if possible)

PSA: Bitcoin is definitely not anonymous. 
I understand that getting into the details of anonymity vs pseudonymity is beyond the scope of the video but blatantly misleading people isn't the right approach.

Has anyone looked at the Costco solar panels?  I've been thinking about picking one or two of these up and having my brother (a master electrician) install them. 
I have 14 GPU's running in my house in MN right now and my electricity bills are $300 per month at $0.12 per kwh.
Is it even worth it though? If I could break even after 5 years I would do it.

The deposits will be going into a personal bank account. The Bitcoins are owned by me personally. I'm selling them to cover some personal expenses.  
In this case I'll only be divesting &lt;10 BTC, but if I was selling 100 per day over a period of time I'd have to imagine someone would have a problem with that. 
If I day trade Bitcoin on an exchange is that a business?  I guess I'm asking for clarification on what operating as a business means.  Whether or not a corporate entity has been formed can't realistically be the yard stick?

Thanks. I had scimmed the entire statute prior to posting here but still have no idea.

I'm curious about how people tumble in this high fee environment. Shapeshift to Monero and back or something? 
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:31:25
Thanks. I'll probably just have people deposit money into my bank account directly so I don't have to deal with that.

I just got an email from Stripe today (srsly) that said they accept Bitcoin payments now

Did Capital One 360 actually close your account or just warn you?  How long did it happen after your first Coinbase transaction? That's my daily driver account and I've purchased through Coinbase so I'm very curious. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:48:43
I read through most of that doc, thanks for posting. What parts would you say specifically apply to Coinbase?

Anyone had any trouble with Ally Bank or USAA?

They charge the bank account via ACH. The credit card serves as a backup if for some reason the ACH is declined
