Injection of code will only do so much surely. You would still need the keys for access to funds. Not as if you can just script kiddy in a keylogger.
@_date: 2016-04-20 16:35:07
Thanks for clarifying. I just copy and pasted the article's title.
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:17:02
It looks like it supports metatrader4 for trade input. Have you had any issues while connected there? I'm pretty familiar with the interface.
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:17:29
How come?
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:07:47
I haven't had that experience. I've used put options with great success with big pharma. Another tool to trade with apart from simple buying and selling.
Have you had a bad experience with this website?
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:30:07
Welcome Jeremiah. I know that pain.
You know it's bad when you own the 'Bitcoinprofile' username.

When everyone is a shill, no one is.
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:03:44
Good videos as alway! Should cover more about the altcoin effect though.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:27:04
Why upvote your FUD? 
This is silly. If you know someone is going to drop a lot of coins, then sell Saturday and pick up free coins on Monday.
Besides, Whale drop only happened because someone put up a massive buy wall and someone had the opportunity to sell off a lot of stock without price slippage. The price drop was from everyone else panicking. May 11th and 18th price continued to increase. Just because something happened twice in a row, doesn't mean it will continue that way.

Received my wire in the account earlier today! Shame it still isn't the $70 dollar price. Best of luck to you Eddie!
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:47:51
Government shutdown too along with Tom Clancy dead (RIP).
Must be 4chan.
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:05:17
Regardless of the FUD, Wire transfers still work. Withdrew my daily limit not one week ago, no issues.
@_date: 2013-06-06 13:53:09
You're so full of it, May 11th and 18th price continued to increase. Just because something happened twice in a row, doesn't mean it will continue that way. 
Enjoy Gambler's fallacy and selling out all your bitcoins for worthless paper money.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:26:46
Was planning on it. It would be nice to buy in a couple hundred bitcoins especially since the bitcoin is about to crash!
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:59:13
Then it would be pointless as the currency would be distributed in a more free fashion and lessen the value of a coin. One of the attractions of bitcoin is that there is only a certain amount of them, unlike our infinite fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:13:09
That's disturbing. It's been a few days now. Here's hoping they put priority to wire transfer tickets! Heh
@_date: 2013-04-24 02:46:05
Oh snap, someone just won a couple years salary. Good for them! I would hold the coins though!
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:25:52
Nothing wrong with concealed carry. Frankly, having a weapon in your household along with a few weeks of food and water in case of an emergency is prudent. Obviously you've never seen supermarket shelves emptied during times of crisis.
@_date: 2013-06-16 13:30:20
Why did I hear this in a voice like the mask from Total Recall??
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:31:12
So, you want to stop people from selling so many bitcoins at the same time? Sounds like regulation on a free market. It would cause more people to withdraw their bitcoins then it would stop whales from cashing out.
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:24:33
You could purchasing bitcoins while the price is relatively then sending those coins to another exchange or account that allows you to withdraw them in GBP.
@_date: 2013-06-16 22:50:17
The price has held at 100 USD for days now. We are overdue a move upwards :P
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:31:36
Putting it out there that one support ticket later with MtGox, I had the money in my account 4 hours later. Make sure you sign up with the support website people, easy to track where people are at with your support petition!
@_date: 2013-04-24 03:18:46
As another early adopter of Bitcoin, you would see the same returns soon. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 10:48:28
Looks like something good to run while i'm working my security job!
@_date: 2013-07-20 18:45:16
Complain. It will usually push it through.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:37:43
Thanks for this. I ran the numbers on my own fees and it's indeed cosmetic. Playing havoc with QT trader as it takes the fees automatically though ;)
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:16:01
Well that is why I would invest it double or nothing on dice. You're either going to be rich or broke in bitcoins.
I day trade myself about 27 bitcoins but only in addition to my real job. If you have the stomach for it, I would learn something new :)
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:30:14
Careful, that is known as Structuring and is a felony.
@_date: 2013-07-02 14:13:20
Is there a video of the presentation available?
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:37:14
A bitcoin as a whole, while divisible, is finite and should hold value. This is opposite to Fiat currency which has finite divisibility and losses value as a whole when more enter the market.
What causes it to have a value is that folk hold a certain amount and this was paid for. Freely distributed would cause it to devalue. You see, when they started Bitcoin, it may be a dime a coin but as long as there is an exchange rate then it retains value.
This is what leads me to believe the easy coins were mined by Satoshi, to prevent a finite amount of something which retains individual value in the hands of someone else. It would be too easy to 'print' money and devalue bitcoins with surplus coins on the market.
Hopefully that all makes sense.

I still have USD in MTGox. Imminent price downturn expected. I feel it is safe there, all the DHS went after was a US bank account tied to Dwolla cash input. MTGox operates worldwide and is not about to go bankrupt.
No worries man, be happy.

Aye, I would be interested in this too. An excel document even!
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:29:28
Looks like my money arrived!
Thanks for your support Mr. White.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:17:40
I did. My message was &lt;Account number, starting with M and ending with X&gt; and 'DO NOT CONVERT'. Only thing I was missing was an IBAN heh
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:21:22
Yeah, I am 23 thousand in the queue. Looks like it drops about 1 thousand a day so I would just buy and hold until your month is up.
@_date: 2013-04-22 00:03:51
Having the same issues. $4000 in limbo for 5 days now. Just submitted my first support enquiry.
@_date: 2013-06-15 03:43:46
People are wisely anticipating a weekend dip. There is significant sell pressure. We may see 70s.
@_date: 2013-05-17 05:06:58
So, 1 BTC lost forever?
@_date: 2013-07-02 14:23:05
Interesting how he doesn't speculate about the price dip and seems very bullish. I support this.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:48:09
Seems plausible that they were mined purely to make it more difficult to mine them ergo not allowing someone else to control so much of the currency. Maybe they are held for financial gain at a later date, who knows. This would be a most ambitious project if this was all about the money.
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:24:18
Pretty much what you just said. While people hold something they pay for, it has a value.
@_date: 2013-05-17 05:14:47
I understand, but Multibit things the transaction was sent. So the wallet balance has decreased appropriately.
@_date: 2013-04-22 00:09:41
Due to be verified after 7000 odd people. Then again, I've already submitted enough documents to steal my identity several times over so there should not be an issue.
@_date: 2013-07-14 00:50:20
Cool video. If I had a fortune of prosthesis experts, I would turn myself into a friend for a laugh.
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:32:50
Yeesh, so much for the internet age eh? 6 days for an electronic transaction.
@_date: 2013-07-15 02:45:51
You're such a tool. What have you ever done to benefit Bitcoin as a whole?
@_date: 2013-05-17 05:10:58
So how would I go about stopping and restarting it then? If you say I can't cancel, then surely it is lost to Limbo.
