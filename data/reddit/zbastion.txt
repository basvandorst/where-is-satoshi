Well since you don't mind having $300 it'd take it from you, please give me your CC info and I promise only to take $300 at once.

Well you can just hold BTC and ETH, the shitcoins are just a plus in that case, an option.
Well there is so many ways to buy bitcoin.. many bitcoin exchanges, private sellers or even bitcoin ATMs.  
I think as a grown up you should find a way without problems :)

It's one of the first pools, very reliable.

Assuming that 250k$ will buy you more than a few cheeseburgers in 3 years.

But you can get your Bitcoin which is what you asked, wasn't it?  
I never said that established exchanges are a bad thing.


Because as you said you might want ETH.  
Binance has ETH.  
One minute you want ETH, the next you couldn't care less.  
Cheez, can someone even deliver a satisfying answer to you?

I can see that being a problem, but why not just buy BTC and buy with bitcoin instead?

I anticipated it to drop before the fork and saw it as an opportunity, didn't know it would happen on the weekend.  
Especially after the fork had been canceled two days before which I didn't notice until a day after I bought. Oh well

Actually had a mail program set up to notify me when prices drop below 6k, so I got pretty surprised when I had a few mails in my inbox on Sunday morning.

Got about half of that.
Coinbase is pretty restrictive :(
