Why will they be forced to catch up? What incentive does a country have to allow bitcoin as a currency? It's a currency that they have no control over.

Are there any alternatives in Canada? I used cavirtex a while ago and I just did a direct deposit to get money on the site. Now they want all my fucking info and only want to do direct withdrawls which cost 30 dollars ffs.

Not in china you can't... it's like gold now in China. You can't buy stuff with it, but you can collect it and sell it for real currency when you need to buy stuff.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:49:05


That's the worst part. Sure, people can collect it like gold, and then sell it  for real currency when they need it, but it defeats the original purpose. To be a digital currency. If bitcoin seriously started becoming a rival to fiat currency in the US, the same thing would happen. They'd let you buy them, but not use them as currency. If that happened everywhere, they'd be absolutely useless.

I personally don't think bitcoin can ever be a currency that rivals fiat currency. As soon as too many people start buying things with it, the US will ban it for use a a currency. They have literally no reason to allow people to use it as a currency over the USD. It just weakens their hold on people. Also, bitcoin was the first, but it's not the best. A transaction can take hours. There are other digital currencies that would be much more suited for use a a currency.

Looks like they were smart to sell at 900. Sure they could have made more, but now they can buy one for 700. IMO you aren't as smart as you think you are. You CAN time the market, and relatively easily. You can make a shit ton of money just buying low and selling high even in a single day if you have enough bitcoins. You would have been smart to sell when they were at 1200, because you could have bought another one today for 700  
According to the downvotes, you guys are too scared to day trade. You can make money that way, and relatively easily. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:02:01
It will likely go above 1200 again. But yeah it is pretty funny watching the price plummet, only because I can't fucking get my hands on one.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:41:00
Why can't it scale to global proportions? You can divide a bitcoin up as many times as you want.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:17:36


Or the US government bans it for use a a currency just like china did, and the price crashes even further. No one knows for sure. I wouldn't be so confident if I were you. The US government has literally no incentive to let people use it as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:02:50
Or maybe I'm missing something...
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:04:39
I realize that... all the data in the entire world still weighs less than an oz of gold. No reason to get that literal. They weigh virtually nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:04:46
What's so funny? It's near 700 now.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:46:21
Hilarious for me, not for anyone that has them.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:30:07
Wow dude. You're REALLY optomistic. You think they'll be worth $43500? That a little insane. Well see what the future hold I guess.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:36:53
Or the US bans it for use as a currency... in which case bitcoin is fucked. When bitcoin starts to threaten the USD, they'll try to put an end to it. They literally have no reason to let people use it for currency over the USD.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:11:42


That's a silly comparison. Bitcoins don't weigh anything.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:57:22
Oh I see. Another problem is the time it takes to make a transaction is just a bit too long.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:27:49
That's a graph alright...
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:38:13
You got downvoted because they don't think it will happen. I personally wish it would go down to 100. It would be hilarious watching bitcoin investors squirm. I only say this because I'm mad that I can't buy any atm.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:05:32
Thanks guy
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:54:26
Barely any of them. Right now people see it as an investment. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:36:08
In the present moment yes. Since I'm having a hard time trying to buy one, it would be hilarious if the bitcoin price went down to 100 then never went up again.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:53:16
Oh how wrong you are. No need to explain people. This guy won't understand anyway because he's clearly mentally handicapped.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:31:06


But if they ban it for use as a currency, you'd still be forced to use those institutions. To buy things, you'd need fiat currency. The only way to avoid those institutions would be if bitcoin was a legit currency.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:54:24
This is almost guaranteed to happen. Mark my words. Once they see that bitcoin could eventually be a threat to the USD, they will put and end to it being used a currency. The US government literally has no reason to let  people use it as a currency. It just weakens their hold on people.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:47:28
And with the money you get from selling them, you can just buy more when the price is lower. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:46:23
What good is an underground currency if you can't use it at any legitimate businesses? Sure you can use them on places like silk road to buy drugs, but what other use would they have?
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:13:27
I'd sell some, and I keep the majority. I'd probably sell 30% of them.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:01:59
Sure, you could trade it with other people... that's not the same as it being a legitimate currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:06:08
I have no idea what this is.
Never mind I see that it's a tip. Thank you sir.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:50:21
You're right, I just used the US because it has the highest amount of bitcoin users by far. But that's beside the point. NO government has any incentive to let it's citizens use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:22:25
Thanks for the link. I was a little confused on what to do with it.
