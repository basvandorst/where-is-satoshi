@_date: 2017-12-04 07:19:32
This. And this last dump was because of exchanges not working... You will know when we hit correction: reddit will cry for a few weeks or months
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:43:22
Care to give a link?
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:44:25
Use  they changed it to BCrash :)

Im using CoinVedi - 
they aggregate all articles from reputable crypto news portals so you can have it all in one place
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:44:09
I use  - they aggregate all news from multiple news portals (coindesk, cointelegraph etc.) so I can check everything in one place
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:07:24
It would be great to get some layman explainantion of this scientific article. As I understood its a proposition that AI can run on blockchain - not that its already running. But, of course I could be wrong :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:49:43
Its going to die? Hahahaha. You must be new here...
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:12:36
Keep away from blockchain.info. not safe
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:53:27
Read more, dont panic, dont get your info from reddit noobs. Read about lightning network, blocksize isuess, etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:53:55
Nope, its bitcoin... Take a look at last two corrections
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:15:55
Poor guy, he really struggles to understand, but no luck...
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:56:46
Great site! Are you using node.js to get and show live prices from Api or something else? Any advice on route to take? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:46:58
70-80% correction will happen. Maybe it alredy started, just like 2 times before that BTC price rised 10x. Also, number of daily transactions isnt equivalent of price rise. So, cheap coins will be in be in range of 2000-3000 if we are correcting. Nothing to worry about, but keep in mind, it wont go up forever...

Dont think of it as a waste. Your overpaid satoshis help miners that secure our network. Thunk of it as a bonus to network. I gladly paid 50sat/byte fee yesterday, although 20 would be sufficient

Tether is small compared to btc mcap and mostly used by americans. You are aware that most of the trading is outside of US? When it burst, we will see a small blip, nothing important for non us residents
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:11:05
Dont use coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:48:36
Havelock, damn, I forgot, there may be something there :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:45:03
Aggregator fixes this, all in one place - 
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:27:33
Bitcoin Kesh frauding people its Bitcoin isn enough for you?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:54:08
You better sell it today then, why wait...
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:08:48
He is talking about calculation of fees, its not based on price of BTC ;)
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:17:47
He doesnt have 5-10 years of life left :)

Did you try with credit card at Indacoin?
US and China are disabled, all other countries work great - 
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:22:57
Bump fee or wait 72h for funds to auto. return to your waller
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:54:57
You can dump all private keys from your wallet in one take for all addresses that are in that wallet. I think the command is dumpprivkey or something - its in bitcoin core guide. But since you just opened bitcoin core, and had no transactions for now, you will probably have only one address in wallet
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:36:21
Its still centralized then, more token than crypto. If Its not crypto, there is no initiative for miners to secure blockhain
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:25:30
I heard Indacoin has option to buy BTC without identity info. Here is a simple guide on how to use it: 
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:09:40
Try  - they aggregate news from multiple Bitcoin/Crypto news portals
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:49:14
Simple - export private keys from bitcoin core (doesnt need to be synced), sweep/import those keys into android wallet of your choice - Samourai or Mycelium
