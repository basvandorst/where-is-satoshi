You see, now all future similar games will be named 999999. You started it!

Awesome idea -- more games and other apps should do it!

You were right but these things happened:
1. There was no other keyboard but the touch one, so users had no choice. Thus a perceived success.
2. Before iPhone touch screens were utter plastic garbage. Glass screens and good sensitivity to touch made big difference. 
3. Absence of physical keyboard made devices thinner, smaller and less clunky - that was another reason they stuck around and ultimately won the "evolutionary selection".

Well, your explanation would work well if the world around us was 100% rational, but it isn't. First thing that comes to mind is -- why do we need need multiple currencies in the world? Why there is silver, if there is already gold that should serve the purpose of storing all the value?
But my main point - if you are a merchant -- why do you even care what currency customers are paying you with? To accept visa, amex and others you need to sign an agreement and pay steep fees, but to accept bitcoin or litecoin (or any other crypto-coin) is completely free! All you are doing is saying that if I have bitcoin -- I can be your customer, but if I have litecoin I have to go through the trouble of converting it to bitcoin first and then make a purchase. Guess what, you've just lost a customer.
There is no principle here -- bitcoin, litecoin or any other -- who cares? If I am opening a bakery tomorrow - I'll accept them all!

This unforgiving nature of reddit bothers me... Where is the love?

Look Ma, no blessing from Visa/Mastercard required!

I've opened additional checking accounts with different banks just in case this happens. It has happened to quite a few people already for no reason whatsoever. Banks don't even need to prove anything, just vaguely say they suspected something.

The difference is that with Bitcoin you can choose whether to use escrow service or not (and in many cases you don't need escrow, as reputable merchants have good return policies and stuff). With PayPal and visa you can't. You always have to pay the fee for the service you don't actually need.

It can be lobbied by organizations with money to make Bitcoin illegal. Since when reasonable arguments won any cases?

I'd say don't waste your time to "right" this "wrong". Banks won't change their position if you'd "reason" with them. They will only change if they will start loosing business.

This almost makes not sense -- they are _asking_ people to donate. If I did that, I'd be happy to accept whatever I am given, and be very thankful at that too. Accepting bitcoin is super easy -- just generate an address and run a wallet. You can then convert all of that to USD or other currency. Fees?! -- you got it for free, remember? This makes no sense... :-(

Well, let me introduce you to the fine concept of [Devaluation]( TL;DR: No one needs that because eventually the currency will make big jumps, and whatever is looking good today, will be unusable at some point in time in future. It is much better to just accept suffixes like 1k = 1000, 1mm = 1000000, etc. People will adjust and computer code will remain simple. IMHO - everybody wins. Even the current "two decimals" thing is an adjustment. As far as the US goes, all the coins except for the quarter are pretty much useless (and cost more in their metal/weight than actual value).

Following this logic, we should do something with cash as well. Average Joes can not be trusted with their own money!

Not worried about competition. They will start lobbying for laws that make Bitcoin illegal to "keep financial system healthy". I give Bitcoin another year before it becomes globally illegal.

True, bitcoins are actually deflationary in nature (as opposed to huge jumps in inflation that are usually the cause for subsequent devaluation), but the concept is the same. It is my expectation that we are nowhere near any "stable" or "plateau" values for any of the cryptocurrencies in the market, so pegging it to some value or prefix/suffix as the "base" is bound to fail.

Awesome bit produced with a rare flavor of high-quality journalism.
