Do people still believe the romantic story that Bitcoin will democratize our society simply because of its decentralized nature? Haven't we learned anything from the internet itself? 
The internet started out with a decentralized design too, and it was supposed to be a tool to push our society toward democracy. Many companies quickly rushed to the internet for profit. Then it became centralized, then we got Google which was wonderful for quite a while, and then Facebook, and then Twitter came along, and now things are totally fucked with Facebook killing our democracy, privacy is completely eroded by companies spying on us, fake news are dominating our lives, and net neutrality is gone too. 
Don't ever underestimate our human ability to destroy and fuck everything up.

I literally read this in Kramer's voice and it all makes sense.

Have you done a drop test on this thing?

This looks like one of those old school Bioshock propaganda posters and seriously awesome. Absolutely fantastic work!

I hope the chain ain't too heavy to walk around with, is it made from plastic? Does your black gym suit represent the dark web? Hard to find a more nerdy Halloween costume than this.

QuadrigaCX always had terrible reputation in scamming people. Luckily I moved my coins out of there long time ago.

Depending on how one chooses to look at it - a half glass full or empty - but it has been said that political power is merely an organized concentrated power of one class for oppressing the other. I'd like to believe that was not the case but the reality of many recent social developments is increasingly placing dents onto that belief. Past human civilizations might have proven that statement to be true, but it may not necessarily mean this condition would always stay true into the future. Are we simply susceptible to this bias or is it really a universal fundamental truth? Only time will tell.

Their support was fantastic too! When I first tried them I couldn't believe such a small team could provide quick, seamless transactions and excellent customer service experience that were unmatched by any of those clunky giant cryptocurrency exchanges out there. Keep it up Shakepay!

For BTC price to go up and reach its maximum potential, it must be able to grow organically. That means the majority of its ecosystem must come from grassroots support and movements, such as individual consumers and small vendors. 
Unfortunately that part is dead now, all you see nowadays are bitcoin futures and trading activities that take place in the financial market ecosystem. This part of the game is always controlled by the banks. 
The transfer of power has been complete. The public has lost it. The game was over when people started treating it as asset instead of money.

That's true, but all the smart ones already made money and got out of Bitcoin. They're the 1%. There's just no money for the rest 99%. It's simply too late. If everyone made money then no one else is rich.

Do people still use BTC to buy drugs online? I thought everyone switched over to Monero for that already.

Exactly this! People keep repeating that because Bitcoin had crashed and then came back before, surely it will come back again. They don't realize that the market has changed a lot since then, the external forces that influence Bitcoin have changed, the landscape of cryptocurrency has also changed. You cannot expect the same results when the entire environment it operates in has changed so much.
Both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said that Bitcoin will inevitably crash. These are people who hold enormous power and have access to information which the general public don't. I'm sure in their positions they are very careful with their words and would hate to be proven wrong. When both of them have said it with such conviction and certainty then we all should at least have a second thought about the future of Bitcoin.

Someone needs to make a new Hitler meme for this.

I understand we should have a representative for every spectrum in the government so all voices can be heard but he's the perfect example of someone who is resistant to inevitable changes and only trying their best to maintain the status quo. His vision is far too shortsighted. 
If you banned crypto and the rest of the world decided to take over its control and then promoting it to become something bigger then the U.S position will be threaten even more. They will start falling behind and it will all be too late by then to do anything. The correct action here is to gain control of crypto and not banning it.
