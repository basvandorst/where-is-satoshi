Nope, 4MB with segwit would definitely be a spam attack as regular transactions still _need_ to use part of the 1MB base block vs the subsidized witness portion. 2MB is very optimistic, current adoption is very low, with Core themselves so far not even supporting it in the GUI.

You made it political with your comment.

Once second layer solutions are available and practical to use, then they may be argued as the best path forward. Until then, dogmatically avoiding any base block capacity increase because it may delay the economic benefits of using LN hubs only serves to give reason for the network effect to bleed out in the meantime.  
Bcash is a response to what some view as _that_ unacceptable situation. BTC is not owed its hashrate, it needs to earn it. Because of the legacy 1MB base block, losses in hashrate are much more dire and disruptive on the chain that operates at full capacity.

3.7 would be an obvious "spam" attack and not relevant to realistic potential. If 100% (currently just over 10%) of today's transaction mix used segwit it might approach 2MB.

Your claim was false and I corrected it, you're welcome. 
Segwit _allows_ for 400% bigger blocks to potentially see 200% throughput. Obviously doubling segwit's parameters doubles segwit's parameters, not sure why you found that so profound.

So childishly simplistic that it _must_ be right. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:39:08
Aw, he takes direction so well. :)
Keep this up and he might hire you like Alex and Samson. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:31:43


Good to see you guys talking about your new altcoin now that reality is beginning to set in. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:53:00
Let's see if the reader does. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:08:20
Because this joint has sunk to _this_ level of irrelevance, _without_ signature ads. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:47:34
Don't despair yet, we've still got a few weeks to flip 90% of miners. If that doesn't work, we reset diff with new PoW.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:48:52


Hilariously false statement. Can't wait to see your node define and police consensus against 85% of miners.  
@_date: 2017-10-08 04:06:11
That brg444 guy they hired was much more subtle, more beneficial for the mission.
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:53:07
Your wife must be pretty (and) stupid. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 05:06:13
*Pretty please!??!*
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:14:06


Too late for that bub. The lines are drawn, the "community" has been whipped into a frothy mob, and now we see which side solves the blocks. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:40:33


Tryin' to take the Bitcoin brand away from its rightful and benevolent owner(s)... for shame. shame.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:12:10
Top place on the internet to LARP as Bitcoin whales in your excessive free time!
@_date: 2017-10-08 04:24:44


Care to name any names? their roles in the associated companies? Or are we just casting a diaphanous cloud of suspected corruption and evil over our "adversary". 
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:43:48


A fan of understatement.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:20:28
Exactly, listening nodes will determine their "work", their "coins" to be invalid, we win again. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:26:48


Correct, as validity of rules is determined at the Core repository level. Satoshi's great invention. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:30:50
Our resolve will only strengthen as the mempool rises. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:33:58


If you're surprised by this _now_, you just haven't been paying attention. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:14:38


Such is your fundamental misunderstanding of what you are dealing with. Bitcoin is a self sustaining and self reinforcing greed machine, it has no concern for brands, copyrights, trademarks, IP lawsuits and such... it was clearly designed to route around all that. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:49:39


It's your altcoin, you can make it as dangerous for people to use as you'd like.




By your altcoin? True.


Hopefully they aren't doing the type of "thinking" you are on the matter. Lol.
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:57:45
If we gaze at our navels with enough intensity... Xapo, indeed the world itself, seems to be begging for our enlightened vision of a competition-free settlement layer. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:09:22
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:53:37


After 5 years of uncompetitive fees just to ensure an excuse for Blockstream's existence, they won't have to raise it.   
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:40:49
Replay "protection" helps the survival of  a minority hashrate chain, which is why it was implemented by the less-work BCH chain. It's a move to ensure survival, not one to unilaterally hand victory to your adversary. Put plainly, you are not "owed" this inertial advantage. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:04:12
This isn't the first time that "sacrifices" in the name of:
 &gt;putting the emphasis on the security concerns, attack surfaces etc.
have provided _useful_ cover for the quiet concentration of authority and power. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:35:07


Well, yeah, _your_ node starts rejecting the chain with the greatest cumulative work quite soon actually. Perhaps you rage quit or migrate to an altcoin with a new PoW. Can't say we didn't warn you.
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:14:38
No, that you've bamboozled to the point you think blockstream and associated agents own Bitcoin. You might be right!
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:40:31


And here:  he is before the vultures arrived.
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:13:03
And we give a discount to sig heavy tx, after a heavy bamboozelment. Job done, almost. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:37:38
That stoic gaze just imbues a calm confidence in the observer. May her predictions come to fruition... she will be heard!
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:43:03
Little benefit for flipping over your cards in a thin market, the main event is just weeks away.
Overconfidence and miscalculation can be leveraged more strongly when the emotions crescendo.
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:49:31


Do 100k nodes listening make a sound? We'll quickly find out. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:02:37
The cosplay moralist bard's tale, dripping with irony. :)
