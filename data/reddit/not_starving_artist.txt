1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin if you didn’t sell.

I'm also interested in this, looking forward to the replies. 
 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:54:55
What would you be selling by the way?

I wish I had gains like that! Well done! 
I started accepting bitcoin last year and I have only sold one for it up to now.

I think I might stick with blockchain, things are moving so slowly that it will past the 1st before they get into my new wallet anyway.

Selling!? I'm buying! 
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:06:42
Thank you for replying so thoroughly. 
So with it being a web wallet, if things split next month will they chose a side for me? Or will I end up with both coins? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:03:24
But is it a proper wallet that I control? If everything splits will I have both coins? Or will Airbitz chose for me? 
Also should I be worried that I can't find a way to backup anything on it?

This made me smile!

Why do you buy so many gift cards? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:58:43
So you wouldn't even bother with Airbitz?

I was hoping for something else, because I sell my paintings for bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:30:49
What would you say blockchain.info would be? Web wallet exchange or light client? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:14:17
I see thank you! 
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:04:51
I started doing the same last month, but no bitcoin sales yet. But I have sold two painting for ETH

I think the auto mod has deleted my link. If you fancy looking search for jeremy gibson art on etsy or instergram. Or just bitcoin on etsy. By the way its art, but I'm not sure if it's good ��

I use bitcoin ticker. It’s ok but I’m interested if there is something better out there.

I can't help, but I can help up vote. Would be fantastic if you could recover them.
