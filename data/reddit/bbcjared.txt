I was going to give 1 - 10 BTC to whoever helps me open it...
20% is a bit too much ..

I know, I think it's going to take some time to sync ... 
100% I didn't spend anything, there was not much ways to spend BTC when I  had control over the wallet..

Good point. Guess I'll write them an email and ask.
Also, question is still open, I'd rather give 10 BTC than 20% :)

I had multiple wallets, one on my laptop, one on desktop, one on work computer. I did send coins between them.  Couple wallets I lost and never found any backups :( 
I have some computer knowledge, but  I don't fix computers or run servers.  I did mine just for fun with couple of my buddies, that' s all I can say. 
I do know part of the password, the " Elliot", part, I'm not sure about special characters.   I did write password down, but it's been so long ago that I can not find it!
I'm not asking anything special, just help me out and point to the right direction.

Yeahhh, but " Generally, we ask for a fee of 20% of the value of the wallet " 20% ... :\\
