I don't think they're obligated to do anything legally speaking (but IANAL).  As for what they will do?  I'd wait for an announcement.

That'd be great, thank you!  Support ticket 519782

They're two separate currencies -- spending BCH won't affect your BCT holdings in the slightest.
The only real risk is exposing your private keys as for most wallets they'll be the same for both BCT and BCH.  Before you sweep your BCH into a wallet that supports it you should move all of your BTC into a new wallet.  Once the sweep is finished you should burn the delete wallet -- never use it again.  Chances are it'd be fine, but why risk it?  Virtually none of the new clients have been properly vetted so I wouldn't want to take the chance.

Anyone having luck verifying their account on Kraken?  They say it should be processed within a few minutes, but it's been three hours and still no dice.

Wish I had thought of this earlier.  Transferring everything out and burning the wallet is obnoxious but necessary.

The wallet I'm using (exodus) does not intend to support BCH. As such, I need to import my btc keys into a new wallet that does. If that second wallet is compromised that exposes those keys, correct?
Is there any way to do this safely while still using the original wallet? Or is (as I expect) the only safe method to move all the btc out, import the keys, then create a new wallet?
Thank you.

Cool, thanks for the info.  One more question if you don't mind:  Are deposits of BCash still disabled on Kraken?
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:35:03
That was my plan, thanks for confirming!  Now to wait for Kraken to actually verify me...

Thanks for your help!

Gotcha.  Thanks!

I'd imagine that'd work, but what I did was even easier:  Instead of creating a new wallet with the old seed I just swept stuff into it via the old private key.  
Moving your btc first is definitely a good idea.
