Innocent until proven guilty? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:30:08
You would be able to do that but you would never be able to spend a significant amount of money on anything ie: a house, car, etc without needing to prove where the funds came from. The burden of proof is on you

You clearly don’t know what spam transactions are. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:27:39
Do I need to move the funds to a new address on a different private seed? Or can I just move them to a new address.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:20:50
No need to be a dickbag
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:01:05
I believe I read that they were already working on a stand alone app.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:04:44
At some point this year google chrome is going to stop allowing chrome apps. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:11:52
Transactions are cheap on shitcoins cause they don’t have nearly the same size user base as bitcoin.

Gemini has 100k a day withdrawal limits for verified users. Thats without asking for them to raise it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:37:22
You can’t scroll through the list of coins on Mobil screen, it just selects a coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:35:08
With both of those yes you own the keys.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:54:58
I don't think Gemini actually has segwit yet.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:21:37
Yes, you will still get your funds
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:44:18
You don't even know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:48:16
So you put the private keys on the card? How do people know your not storing them?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:01:55
Its not like you are throwing any money at it. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:17:25
Bittrex is more for trading alts and lots of coins Coinbase doesn’t list. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:23:12
I would like trezor to support those coins too so they can be sold, what’s wrong with free money? Not everyone here has minuscule amounts of bitcoins, these forks are worth big money for coin holders who have a lot of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:35:41
No one should be asking you for your seed. If you give this out, it is possible for someone to steal your funds.
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:32:41
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:04:20
No, unless you can control the private keys in a hardware wallet or a wallet where you have the seed they are not your private keys. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 10:19:21
How to bots like this get past the Captcha Login?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:45:35
Its gone bro. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 02:53:50
What info is required to cash out BTC at those atm's?
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:52:01
You would never actually see any profits from mining on a laptop, maybe 7 years ago it would have been a different story. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:39:51
You can use Gyft.com to buy a hotels.com gift card with btc and use that to find a hotel in Amsterdam

What info is required to cash out BTC at those atm's?
@_date: 2015-05-14 03:35:19
Yeah it seems there service is shit lately. Ive been waiting weeks for an order to ship
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:40:28
You can gamble with Bitcoin here? Or just buy drinks/food?
@_date: 2015-05-27 04:48:39
Just as high priced on the markets. Most people don't ship to Aus because of tight customs. So what was on the markets available in Aus was priced similarly high.
@_date: 2016-01-02 08:13:58
Probably using stolen credit cards.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:52:38
Yes, it uses a web based service so you don't have to worry about running out of space for your coins apps like the ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:14:36
You should add a map with available locations, it might be nice to look around for a place to stay at without a destination in mind.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:11:00
I have the trezor and have no complaints. Nice and simple setup and easy interface.
@_date: 2015-08-30 06:39:00
What info do your machines want for BTC -&gt; Cash
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:17:20
I know the pin for the device. And upon plugging in the new unopened one I had, I'm required to update firmware and it again asks "Scan or enter your security card QR code: it is located in your recovery sheet provided with your ledger wallet". This is new and unopened and didn't come with anything like that. Did ledger just make this wallet useless? Theres no way to even set one up anymore or recover funds?
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:06:36
Can you not withdraw over $10,000 from your own account without scrutiny? I Always thought it was just when it was coming in?
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:22:25
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:33:40
Not sure really, could be cause most people don't like to keep there coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:14:56
You compare the addresses still before you send. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:05:50
Would they be wanting proof of the price you bought in at?
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:54:32
A lucky day 
@_date: 2015-09-11 03:20:10
Do they want blood samples too?
@_date: 2015-09-13 09:10:07


Well it is HIS money. He should be able to access it when he wants.
@_date: 2015-11-09 07:11:38
What stops sellers from selling fake gold bullion to buyers?
@_date: 2015-10-17 18:21:07
I believe that was a man in the middle attack on the tor nodes from blockchain.info and they were stealing funds from that sites users. Which they fixed by creating there own onion address with a certificate. Ive never had trouble with electrum.
