What about if the two of you get in a car crash and lose a bit of your memory but otherwise 100% fine so you just lose your money because of a little accident and then you have no bitcoins left? Don't you think its unsafe to store the keys in your head because of this reason?

I have also read about the Tulip mania and I don't think it can be compared to Bitcoin because the conditions were so much different. But yeah that is what people do, they compare the Tulip mania with every bubble and anything that could or might be a bubble because it was the first documented clear example of a bubble.
But yeah Bitcoin could be in a bubble right now or a bubble could just be starting to form or we might not be in a bubble. It all come down to what people who invest in it believe, because the price is 100% supply and demand.
What I do know is that the internet bubble was 20 times larger then what Bitcoin is today even if Bitcoin is more available then internet stocks was and there is way more money then there was 15 years ago.
Also what you need to remember is that 1bitcoin=1bitcoin no matter what. Most people who invest in Bitcoin do it to support it because they believe in a decentralized future and not to try profit and create more wealth for themself. Just like investing in a charity, you do it for a greater good and not to purely benefit yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:49:53
I don't know how that date is relevant. The mainstream media been comparing the price of Bitcoin to the tulip mania of 1637 for several years now and that is probably where you heard it first.

Only reason you have tulip-mania in mind is because you follow mainstream media and let me tell you something, if you get your news from CNBC or CNN etc. you will allways be a few steps behind.
Also people would pay 10 years of labor for 1 tulip. Now 10 years of labor would be around 1 million dollars and one Bitcoin is still only 17,000$. We won't be a in a bubble aslong as people keep saying it is a bubble, we will know we are in the mania phase when people stop talking about it being a bubble.

Oh okay, no I was not confused I just thought you meant that everything adds up. One 2$ is not much but it quickly adds up to 12$ or 100$ when you save many 2$. And if 2$ is not much is 12$ or 100$ much?
Also he want to withdraw the money to hes bank account so I assumed it is not in bitcoin but in fiat so there is no such a crazy inflation.

So if I sell 99% and keep 1% I am in it for the long run but if I sell 100% instead of 99% I am trying to make a quick buck?
How many percent would you say that one can sell and still be in it for the long run?
I sold 100% of my Bitcoins but I would still say I am in it for the long run because I will buy back later, I just think bitcoin is in a bubble right now BUT in the long run I think we are still way too early, will take 1-2 decades before Bitcoin become big.

Okay you got me, nice troll :D LOL I thought you were being serious until you compared yelling "fire!" in a real life situation to a headline on the internet. That is just too much so I knew you had to be a troll, if you actually thought all headlines, comments, texts, videos , games and everything else on the internet especially on random forums were facts you would probably be dead by now or atleast in a mental institution because of all the panic and conflicting "facts" that would have messed up your head by now.

My thread is not a lie, if you actually read thru it complete you will figure out my headline and everything else is fictional stating a hypothetical situation? Do you know what that mean?
And yes it appears that most responses are from people who got butthurt but trust me most people just laugh it off. 
The intention with my thread was to start a discussion how the market would react if the US banned bitcoins and my headline was intentionally made to draw attention without lying because I when they click they see it was just stating a hypothetical situation, so we would get more people discussing the hypothetical situation but it appears most people here are too invested in bitcoins to even be able to discuss about a potentially negative situation for bitcoins.

Its called clickbaiting, are you new to the internet? if you ever go on youtube you will see 99% of the videos have clickbait headlines.
You should never take anything on the internet seriously before you check the facts from several sources in my opinion.
Also yelling fire in the movie theater is a little bit different to this, this can be compared to the movie theater owner and fire department setting off the movie theater fire alarm to practise a emergency evacuation so after the fire alarm in the end it says its a test.
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:28:21
I probably just did it on the wrong forums, people here are too invested in bitcoins to even imagine a potentially negative situation for bitcoins. Or because too many kids got butthurt downvoted my thread because of that.

@_date: 2017-03-03 17:02:02
It is extremely silly, the term ounce have been around for just a few hundred years but gold been around for millions of years. 
Also which do you think is worth more: 7000 1 oz peanuts or 20 2 oz peanuts?
Also I was wrong about one thing when making this thread: 1 gold does not mean the whole market cap it means 1 gold atom and 1 gold atom is worth $0.000 000 000 000 000 000 025 so a bitcoin is worth 5,088,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times more then 1 gold aka 1 gold atom

You need to remember the hard fork could become the real bitcoin if it gets over 51% popularity. Just like the real Ethereum is now called Ethereum Classic and the hard forked version of Ethereum is called Ethereum now because the hard fork got majority support
Btw no need to downvote my comments just because im telling the truth and being honest, downvoting my comments will not change the facts even if I wish it would change the facts also.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:56:48
Because the anticipated hardfork happened very recently so people are not expecting aonther one to happen in a while. When there is a risk of a hardfork people don't want to lend their cryptos out because according to poloniex rules they will not get the forked version if they cryptos were lended during the time. But now when there is basically no risk of a hardfork people are happy to lend out their Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-17 23:48:23
Not sure if your trolling but if bitcoins did become a payment system for the masses the wallets people would be using would for sure have built-in mechanisms for preventing this kind of things from happening. Even the bitcoin wallets im currently using won't even let me manually enter a fee..
I don't understand how you can so stupid you think some small detail like this what can easily be fixed would decide if a payment system is viable or not. It is the same as I would have said 500 years ago before planes were invented that humans will never be able to fly because we don't have wings like birds.

Im 99% sure its not the posters transaction. But whoever did that transaction I have no idea what he was doing but he was not using one of the popular and safe wallets that have built-in mechanisms to prevent this kind of errors what noobs like him should be using if there is the slightest chance they accidently put in a fee a million times higher then intended. But yeah theese kind of accidents where people pay too much or lose their money some other way like before the victim of credit card theft, skimming, scanning happens millions of times daily around the world with people using cash and credit cards and there is no fix for that either unless they have some kind of insurance but you could in the future get a insurance for losing your bitcoins for being a retard too.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:46:26
Its right now 3 times more profitable to mine Bitcoin than Bitcoin Cash. This is because Bitcoin Cash is overmined right now so the difficulty is not dropping. What this means is there is more miner support for Bitcoin Cash than market interest. This only proves that the market have the final say and control Bitcoin and not the miners.

I would have said the same as you a year ago. But with Trumps plans to hyperinflate the dollar I would recommend keeping nothing in dollars right now. Invest in metals, food, real estate anything while your dollars have good purchasing power or you will regret it within a year.
And when it come to the euro, all theese bank bailouts and uncertainties in eu in general will probably cause smaller scale hyperinflation after the hyperinflation in the US starts.
It would be irresponsible to suggest people should sell their bitcoins, precious metals, stocks and real estate for dollars or euros right now.

1. Do you even realise how silly you sound when you are saying it is substantially easier to turn a million dollars into a billion dollars compared to turning 0 into a million? Turning 1 mill into 1 bill is a 1000x increase... So would you would be able to turn 1000$ into a million dollars that is a 1000x aswell but with a much lower amount of money so it should be easier? I could invest a few grand in you if you can actually 1000x it and many millionaires would invest millions in you if you could actually turn it into billions, but I really doubt it because u would just get a bank loan and just do it if you actually knew what you were talking about.
2. Yeah whatever just some of the main points why people like Andreas Antonopolous is defending Bitcoin.
3. I do not know where you get these statistics but people who are born into money usually fail at life. Just look at all the rich kids of celebs who failing at life doing nothing but drugs.
Also if you look at forbes rich list 60% of the people made it from scratch so it is not really a valid excuse to not become a billionaire if you were born in the hood with dyslexia and no money. 8 out of 12 sharks that been in the sharktank have dyslexia(learning disorder)
I would understand if you were arguing that it is easier to become a billionaire if you start with a million dollars compared to no money. But it does not make it that much easier because otherwise every billionaire would be giving 1 million dollars loans to random people as investments...
4 It is yet to be seen and many things he is trying to change cant  easily be changed. And it could be it is what he is thinking that he is working for a greater good but that does not mean he cant end up fucking up things even more. Just the fact that he have made it where he is today is evidence of him usually being really good and successful at what he does.
I think you dont really understand big numbers like we saw with you claiming you could turn 1 million dollars into a billion dollars but cant turn 0 into a million... let me write what a few thousand and the amount of votes look like

@_date: 2018-02-12 05:30:04
1. Yeah okay you are delusional if you think you can turn 1 million into billions but you cant turn 0 into a millions.
2. That is the whole idea with Bitcoin to put people in control of their money so they can choose if they want to pay tax or not and therefore restrict the power of governments and banks working for them.
3. There is nothing wrong with going bankcrupt, it only mean you did take a risk and failed. Most people dont even take a risk and never even have a chance at succeeding.
How do you know it was not all calculated risks? It all ended up going right for him. He filed for bankcruptcy several times but now he is rich. He used a controversial campaign never seen before by anyone in the history and became the president.
Do you really suggest that it was luck what got Donald Trump to become one of the worlds most successful entrepreneurs and the president of one of the greatest nations of all time?
I would understand if he was only the president or only a billionaire but the odds of both of those is so minimal there is no way it was luck what got him where he is.
4 Ask yourself this, if you lived in a fucked up country with fucked up people would you not lie, be a racist and even commit murder so you could become the leader of the country if it was what it did take  so you could finally be able to change things for the better for a greater good?
" (nearly 3k people who regret it)" Are you kidding me? Do you know how many people live in the United States of America? Go look up on wikipedia and then ask yourself if you think 3000 peoples votes matter. We don't even know if those are bots, americans or paid shills or someones early presidential campaign to make Trump look bad.

1. Would you able to create a billion dollar business if you got a million dollar loan?
2. Why are you in Bitcoin in if you think everyone should be able to see your tax returns?
3. Almost everyone successful have failed several times before succeeding, all you need is to make it once and every shot you dont take is a missed shot.
4. If it is what it takes then why not? It is the people who voted for him that are mental if it takes being a lying racist to become the president of the United States of America nowdays.
5. Please show me some evidence of this. I know he is controversial but I just did some research and all the biggest gambling sites have Trump as a huge favorite to win the presidential election 2020 so it seems to me like someone is lying and manipulating you to think people dont support him anymore. You should know the media is full of bullshit.

You are mistaken, Trevon, Nick and Craig all profited several hundred thousand dollars if not millions of dollars from BitConnect referrals that they cashed out from BitConnect that they have right now in their bank accounts and cryptocurrency accounts. 
Each of them put only the minimum of 100$ of their own money into BitConnect and the rest they made from promoting and referring people into the ponzi.
What do you mean youtube pulled people into the scam? It was people like Craig, Trevon and Nick who put up youtube videos, youtube ads and facebook ads promoting BitConnect to earn more from the referrals even if they most likely knew it was a ponzi scheme and even if they did not know they were promoting people into a ponzi scheme it does not really matter because it is still illegal. Just because you do not know murder is illegal it is still illegal and you still get sentenced if you murder someone and good luck trying to convince the jury that you did not know the crime you committed was illegal, might work and you get sent to a mental hospital but there is alot of video evidence suggesting they had a good idea it was a ponzi scheme that they were promoting.
I never invested in BitConnect but I kept warning people thousands of times on different forums and youtube video comments about it being a ponzi that will collapse late 2017 or early 2018 and warning Nick, Trevon and Craig in comment sections that they are committing a crime and will end up in prison unless they stop.
The FBI will of course try to find the masterminds behind BitConnect who made tens or hundreds of millions of dollars but they will also try find the promoters who made smaller amounts but still worth their time investigating like Nick, Trevon and Craig.
Nick, Trevon and Craig are no low level kids on youtube, those 3 together got people to invest tens of millions of dollars thru their referrals with youtube videos and ads and that is a serious a amount of money.
You could argue that promoting a ponzi scheme is not as bad as creating a ponzi scheme but without promoters a ponzi scheme would not work and both are highly illegal crimes according to US law. Just like manufacturing illegal guns is a crime but using the illegal guns to shoot people is also a terrible crime and both the big player aka manufacturer and small player the person who used the gun will be held accountable for their crime even if the small player could not have committed the crime of shooting someone if no one manufactured the illegal gun first.

There have been taxes in the US for over 300 years... No taxes might have worked 400 years ago but not anymore because now there are very powerful weapons. If we dont chip in and create these weapons with tax money and democractically vote who control them, then someone would overtake our country.
Yes there are some rich people in the US who could buy their own armies and develop their own weapons if we stopped paying taxes and had therefore had no military to protect our country. But then these people would basically run and control the country like dictators because they would have all the power and how do you think this is better then the democratic system we have now where every person have a equal vote?
I think our democratic system right now is not perfect, it need improvements but we still need to pay taxes. I suggest we stop letting idiots vote so we get real presidents instead of Trumps. There should be some tests you have to pass to be eligible to vote that prove you know what you are voting for. So people who spend hundreds of hours studying the alternatives get to vote but the people who just listen to the news a little bit and then flip a coin who they vote for dont have a vote until they put in the work and prove they know what they voting for.

Nick is white and I never invested a penny into BitConnect. People are not trying to get their money back because that would be impossible but what they are trying to get is justice. Trevon, Nick and Craig should be stripped out of the money they made from promoting the ponzi scheme and get punished with a fitting prison sentence.
People are stupid and will keep investing into ponzi schemes but promoters and creators of ponzi schemes still need to be punished.
Why do you blame youtube? Why dont you blame youtubes internet provider or the creator of the internet because without the internet youtube would not excist?
And yes Youtube and Facebook might also get punished with a fat fine if not more, there is a reason why Facebook recently banned all ICO ads. I think Youtube and Facebook ads might not even get manually checked and products investigated, it might be a automated process and therefore ponzis and other bad things can get thru. Nick, Trevon and Craig all put alot of thought into their videos and ads so it is little bit different but I you are right about that youtube and facebook deserve to get punished too if they violated any laws with the ads but this does not make Trevon, Nick and Craig any less responsible for their own crimes.

"In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system. Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo created "Bit Gold". Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, Bit Gold was an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. A currency system based on a reusable proof of work was later created by Hal Finney who followed the work of Dai and Szabo."

@_date: 2017-07-16 01:52:31
No, the block fiasco have been going since the start of the year when bitcoins were 1000$. So you could say the block fiasco have doubled the price of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:44:14
Yes sir, if segwit locks in we can expect bitcoins to tenfold in price like other cryptos like litecoin have done after locking in segwit

"whats a fork" Indian spotted
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:43:49
BCC is not bitcoin, its chinese fork. We can argue about this forever without any result. Next month we will see which one of us is right about BCC being bitcoin or not being bitcoin but my guess is it will be a altcoin.
I just dumped all my BCC on bitfinex and bought bitcoins with the money and basically doubled my real original bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:53:53
What? I just looked on coinmarketcap BCC=Bitcoin Cash=Chinese Fork=Anti Bitcoin Core
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:04:12
Oh wtf bitfinex scammed me, they better fucking refund me or im going to sue their scammy asses
Also on a side note, bitconnect is a ponzi

He didn't have any valid proof it is the same as I would claim I can live using my D only. All I have to find is a rich gay man who falls in love with me and then pays for everything for me aslong as I give him the D.

bitcoin gonna take many dives under to under 10$ per btc before its going to become HUGE
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:01:08
Common it is the same as I would claim im a vegan because I don't eat meat but I would work in a slaughterhouse...
And everything he pays for in bitcoins the price depends on the fiat value and no set bitcoin prices so he could just aswell be using fiat if he cant buy things directly with bitcoin without using middlemen who take a cut for doing it for him...

You know its fiddy-fiddy either it will happen or it will not happen

You buy from everywhere and everyone who is selling and keep quiet about your intentions so you don't drive up the price.
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:40:15
Good idea I should also probably encrypt everything on the paper wallets so if someone found them they would not understand what they are
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:02:04
I know for sure bitcoin will be worthless eventually. After 100 trillion years no one will know what bitcoin was.
@_date: 2016-07-09 13:42:20
Paper wallets used corrently are just as if not more secure then a trezor, trezor is just for convenience not security.
A trezor is not that complex technology it should be worth 50% of price of a smart phone.
And yes you can buy protection with money, but if you want the best value of your money don't spend it on a 100$ trezor please, you can spend less money for a few safety boxes in a few different banks for your paper wallets.
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:02:09
use 3/5 multisig so you can lose 2 out of 5 trezors and remember to change them to fresh ones every few years
would be crazy using just 1 trezor anything could happen to it, it is just materialistic hardware after all that will last max a few years in best case scenario

@_date: 2016-07-09 18:04:18
I got contacts, my big brother and hes friends run a mining rig with over 20 computers, there is no profit anymore mining bitcoin anymore unless bitcoin price goes up or electricity get cheaper. Much better profit mining dogcoins currently.
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:15:22
Just frustrating to see people getting scammed every day because of the same mistake of not keeping coins in wallet they control.
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:33:02
I have multisig paper wallets with multiple copies of them in couple of different locations incase two locations get compromised from like a house fire, robbery, missile, tsunami, volcanic eruption, tornado, meteorite or other natural disaster.

I see them as pokemon, I want to catch them all eventually.
@_date: 2016-07-15 10:34:12
I mean that he is using hes bitcoins just like fiat, all prices depends on the value of the fiat. No one he is dealing with have solid bitcoin prices its all calculated depending on the fiat value of the product or service he is buying...
So he is not using bitcoins to hes advantage, bitcoins is just a handicap for him. This is not what bitcoins was made for if you look at the fundamentals...
@_date: 2016-07-03 12:04:33
Yes but where should I hide the Trezor with my life savings to keep it safe? I would not feel very comfortable having a 7 million dollar device lying around
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:37:13
if a ice cream cone cost 100 million dollars the 100 million dollars in paper and metals would be worth more

I could buy a Bic Mac Meal if I sold my bitcoins now that I been HODL:ing for several months, is this the sign from the universe?
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:52:16
You don't understand the fundamental idea behind bitcoin then for what it was created in the first place.
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:48:13
So you think that cryptocurrencies are a bad investment that billionaires should not invest in? Why?
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:54:18

@_date: 2016-07-14 20:18:27
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:59:35
Atleast its safer there than in the hands of a nutjob like you who would even consider Coinbases vault to  be safe.
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:16:52
I would pay max 5$ for a trezor when the cost of manufacturing is like 2$ max. But I guess when they have no real competitors they can ask for any price. Like they say the one who ask is not stupid but the one who pays.
But yeah you need multisig wallet with multiple trezors if you want to use only trezors as your offline wallets, I would not trust that the trezors will work forever and this way hopefully they would not all fail at once so you have time to change the broken ones. But even if it can't connect your computer your bitcoins could possibly still be saved, just contact trezor customer support I guess.

But with gold there keeps comming new technology to extract gold from even deeper places and easier. So could this bitcoin halving thing still be reversed if I don't want my bitcoins to halve?
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:40:59
*facepalm* 
They will pay your bills with fiat after you pay them with bitcoins.
It is the same as I would say I could live a year with paying for everything with my bum. All I had to do was find a rich gay guy who will pay for everything for me if I let him use my bum.
Do you see the problem now? Your paying bitcoins to middlemen to pay for your bills with fiat, that is cheating because otherwise you could live using pretty much anything as currency for a year if you just find one person who accepts it and you give him enough of it so he will pay with fiat for you so you don't have to use fiat for anything because you have someone following you around doing it for you lmao.
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:53:05
Yes that is why I was confused. You think he is talking bs and really not investing in cryptocurrencies or investing in some other way?
I seen it many times thru history that great inventors usually fail, someone else copy their idea and do it better just like what Steve Jobbs did he worked for Bill Gates ripped off hes ideas and did it better as a business.
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:59:56
You seem confused let me explain to you. You can't use cryptocurrencies buddy they are virtual. You can only exchange them for stuff like clothes, food, services etc. just like fiat or you can exchange them to fiat and use the fiat for the clothes, food and services etc.
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:11:07
Look I send you one bitcoin if you tell me what company you can pay your rent, hospital, insurance, electricity, water, internet and phone bill with bitcoins and what grocery store accepts bitcoins as payment
@_date: 2016-07-03 13:07:27
That is not relevant to my question. I have 0.2 bitcoins but its alot to me so I want to have it protected like someone with 10,000 bitcoins would.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:23:45
Not for long when people see the price so low

@_date: 2017-06-10 13:53:14
I think you are confusing market value with the real value. It is literally impossible that bitcoins market value is the same as its real value. My valuation was for the real value of bitcoins not the current market value that you look up on exchanges or coinmarketcap.

so I can swim in my money like Scrooge McDuck instead of just fantasising about swimming in my bitcoins...
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:43:53
No he told me he know people who will pay with fiat for you if you send them enough bitcoins thats just stupid, I would not call that living on bitcoins only..
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:16:22
ITS GOING DOWN
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:49:50
Yes that is my point, the reason I invested in bitcoins was to make profit. But over time when bitcoins keep going up I keep getting greedier and making excuses why not to sell yet. It is like an addiction your keep increasing the limit you have invested in bitcoins more then you planned.
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:05:00
Yeah thats what I just told you, you didn't use the bitcoins you exchanged them for goods. You have not paid for anything with your credit card, bank transfer or cash in over a year? I got a hard time to belive that unless you still live with your parents and don't need to buy groceries, pay rent, pay bills etc.
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:28:34
You know how a slingshot works right? It pulls back before launching
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:28:02
But you can't pay your hospital bill, insurance or electricity or anything else official with bitcoins. If electricity is included in your rent then your paying your landlord bitcoins but he needs to pay the electricity bill with fiat.
This is the same as I would claim im living on bitcoins only if I hire someone who take bitcoins for all services like going out and buying groceries for me or pay my bills but he does it with fiat after I sent him bitcoins for doing it for me lmao.
And that is not exactly a accomplishment because you can live with anything then. A prostitute could claim she been living using her pussy only to pay for everything because she let some rich guy use it who then pays for everything for her so she doesn't need to touch or see any currency.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:35:41
im selling half of my coins in honor of the halvening so others can get some coins cheaper
