Did you mix your bitcoins after getting them out of coinbase?

How do you check certificate? I usually just glance over the URL bar to check if there is a padlock, is that enough?

Nice analogy.
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:54:32
and how do they know OP was the one who purchased that?

how is storing your backup phrase in a password manager reducing security to the level of a web wallet? (assuming your using strong passphrase)
@_date: 2014-10-15 22:34:20
nice catch. how did you retrieve it?
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:44:32
They have been doing that forever

The risks of buying and using bitcoin are much ~~lower~~ higher than downloading a movie.  
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:57:33
Interesting. Did you send bitcoin to another person? I'm not talking about purchasing stuff from a company, I'm talking about sending it to friend/family?

Follow up question, has trezor been audited by security professionals? I have no programing background and I don't even know how to read a code.
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:05:23
You got your answer then. That person probably bought using those bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-24 18:46:53
You have a point here. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:00:38
hmm, this is a bit unsettling. I need to read more about this.
@_date: 2014-12-24 11:25:57
I meant higher not lower.

I use coinsafe cold storage method. It's a bit hassle to set up, but you only need to do it one time.
1. Get a new cheap laptop with a CD-Tom. Remove the wireless card and plug the ethernet port.
2. Install a fresh copy of TAILS and encrypt you hard drive with a strong password using /dev/random
3. Download the software from their repo and verify its SHA-256 hash.
4. Generate the private keys. They recommend generating about 100k private keys just in case.
5. encrypt the keys and save multiple copies in multiple new USB thumb drives. Carefully write down the password on a piece of paper. Test the several time to make sure everything is all right.
5. Put those Thumb drives in seperate secure location. A bank safety box is preferred.
6. Divide the decryption key using SSSS and give those shares to trusted parties. I use (3 of 5) personally.
7. Transcribe those shares manually onto archival paper. Make sure you type them correctly.
8. Give those shares to trusted parties hand by hand.
9. Don't forget to wipe you hard drive when your done.
Rembmber, with bitcoin, you are responsible for your own security. You have to be extra paranoid.
Good luck!

I upvoted this. I like bitcoin and I use it to buy few things online that I don't want to be linked to me directly coughporncough. However, most the bitcoiners I see IRL are those with extreme views that pushes all scam alerts. One argument I see is that bitcoin is open source and trustless. This makes no sense for anyone who doesn't know how to read a code. They have to trust internet nerds not to screw them up.
These people would trust a regulated USD more than the highly advertised, controversial, internet money that was made by anonymous person. I don't really blame them. There are very few cases where using bitcoin is better than a credit card and most people don't care about them.
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:44:15
OP was talking exactly about these people.
@_date: 2014-10-17 21:26:16
Wait, this not how it works.
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:52:09
Classic charlie.
@_date: 2014-12-23 14:25:25
Come on, there are no safety nets in bitcoin. If something goes wrong, all your money is gone, forever. If someone is going to store large amounts of money, which is a huge risk to begin with, he should make a god damn effort to read and fact-check everything about this.
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:16:33
This is scary.

Can anyone re-upload the two PDF files? 
@_date: 2015-04-01 06:40:20
What's that supposed to be?

So I can't use bitcoin if I have dogecoin?
@_date: 2015-02-28 20:45:26
Sorry, I'll remove that. can you confirm he's also changetip employee?
@_date: 2015-02-28 20:43:43
I'm upset that a changetip employees are creating multiple reddit accounts for tipping without disclosing who's behind them. I feel like they are cheating. I thought some of these users are part of this community, a person doing his job. 
I would feel the same if I found out that coinbase employees for example are creating multiple accounts to post coinbase articles all the time and upvoting them to the frontpage. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 20:34:04
You don't find it suspicious that Changetip employees are secretly creating multiple accounts to tip users all over reddit? They should at least be transparent about these things. 
~~was also allegedly running for tipping according to read u/ivorbighead response below.
@_date: 2015-02-28 21:11:41
I removed all references to Gorillamania. I really think it's a scummy move to let their employee do this.
