Such a damn good book.  I wish they would hurry up and make the movie already, various studios have been promising it for like the last 10 years.

Serious question: how do you think relativity will affect the blockchain?

This should be the top comment.  
Just because *human* labor is worth less, does not make money a less powerful instrument, in fact it only increases the value of money since the time value of some machines is higher than that of humans.

I believe the term is "31 Satoshis"

Marketing gibberish? Dude I don't have any affiliation with either of those projects.
I found out about sia because I wanted to do cloud storage of large files and I didn't want to pay $20/mo for Dropbox or whatever shit. Did it work? No. Sia client sucks, their interface is clunky and your files are dependent on some random ass json file in addition to your private key. But if they can fix that shit, it has real potential.
And as for IOTA, let me tell you this. I got fuckin burned by them. Their graph theory block chain has serious flaws. Every 6 months your coins just fuckin disappear and you have to go through some weird ass procedure to port them to the new chain. But I'll tell you what: when MIT or Intel comes out with their paper titles "demonstration of quantum Shor's algorithm" and a month later
Satoshi's wallet moves, every bitcoin you have is going to be worthless. Every ether too. Diversification, dude. It's not a bad thing.
I'm not saying "invest in sia and iota". That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm just saying that those projects are novel ideas and they have potential to fill roles bitcoin can't.

The first one was basically saying that no one should buy anything except bitcoin and all other altcoins are useless; and I think there was some caveat for ETH.  
The one responding to me was basically saying "lol" at sia and iota.

What am I looking at, other than the nice tits?

What's to stop alternative cryptos (like LTC) from taking up the slack when BTC becomes so valuable that people stop mining for lack of returns?
