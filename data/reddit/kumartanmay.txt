All tangential ... ha ha! You have been very kind.

So not knowing about a thing or a naive asking basic questions is stupidity? Were you born with all the knowledge? Yes google is my friend and everyone has their way of learning else google would be the best school in the world my friend. I am sure you are not the brightest person on the planet. 
Don't let your arrogance or your situations of life reflect on the way you share your knowledge. Everyone is fighting a tough battle.

Thanks a ton for clearing it out. Cheers
Who invented the property behind these numbers? Where can I find such numbers, if I have to just see how does pre-mined data/ number looks like?
I don't understand your questions. We don't know who created Bitcoin. He/they called themself Satoshi Nakamoto, but it's almost certainly a pseudonym. There was no pre-mine.
The puzzles are cryptogrpahic in nature. So these numbers must possess some properties. There must be a rule to generate. Isn't it?

Okay ... I thought surfing was easier than asking questions. For most of the things there is google. Even for most of the reddits!

Did I claim to be an expert? If you are one then please care to respond to questions than pointing out faults. 
As far as I have learnt about curiosity, there are no stupid questions. Only answers can be stupid.

This is really cool. Reading it now.

Thanks for spending time to express yourself. Whenever you don't feel like answering "stupid" questions, please don't waste your time. There are others who would care to share. Every expert was once a stupid on the subject.

My understanding of the puzzle doesn't get into my head and hence tangential.

Interesting that only 21m BTC will be mined, of which 16m have already been mined. So 5m left to be mined yet. Going the by average of 12.5 BTC created per 10 minutes, 144 BTCs are mined each day! So it will take roughly 35000 days to mine the rest 5 million BTCs! That makes it close to 100 years!  
Because the rate of mining halves every four years, all the remaining 5m BTC is almost impossible to mine. It's as good as mining for a treasure on the basis of diminishing evidence. 
Comparing it with the past, mining 16m BTCs took almost no time! We should soon have smaller units of BTC (may be a thousandth or millionth of BTC) if future belongs to BTCs. 
Now my follow on questions:
1. Who invented the property behind these numbers? Where can I find such numbers, if I have to just see how does pre-mined data/ number looks like? 
2. How did you come up to rate of inflation at 4.1%?

What are the ways of doing it?
