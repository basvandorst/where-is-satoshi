I'm sad that comments like this get downvotes. It is an honest opinion and even though I don't completely agree, there is value in his arguments.

Why does this get downvotes? If you don't agree, give counterarguments. There is no need to make the post less visible. Although I think is wrong, It's not complete nonsense.

If I had a few billion like he does, why not? Enough money to buy some of every alt coin, just for fun.

Thanks, I already found it. Those graphs, so nice.

I actually hold them for fun; others buy a lottery ticket. I think I do have a fair chance at winning though :)

Could it be possible to implement Lightning Network before the current block size becomes an issue?

This posts reflects how I'm feeling pretty good. I've been lurking for a while and am especially interested in the ledger concept. Combined with Russia and the slowly but steadily increasing attention, I see a bright future. That's why I finally got some too.

How long do you think it would take to do a soft fork like that? More than a year?
I personally see Lightning as the perfect solution. I just can't see any flaw.

I think that mining farms will become less and less necessary. Now, while coin growth declines so quickly, mining tends to get centralized. The incentives behind this will diminish as coin growth declines slower.

This troll is both funny and correct... You could stop downvoting

You might drive down the price in the short run, but long term adoptation and thereby the price will flourish.

Damn this is easy

Bitonic is a great service. You simply put in the amount and the address on which you want to receive that amount. You then pay using iDeal, which every Dutch bank supports. Their price is a little higher than others, but I think it's worth it. Also, when I tried to search for alternatives, there simply weren't any; only international, larger sites where I have to submit an ID etc. Thus, I think it's worth it.

It's not about the number of people, it's about the amount which sellers want to sell and buyers want to buy at a certain price.

Losing together bonds the group, probably.
