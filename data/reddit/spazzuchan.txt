Be me at work
Browse Reddit avoiding sketchyness and NSFW links

Immediately question decision
Pleasantly surprised at outcome

Is there some way we could get a list of the exchanges that Reddit trusts? The sidebar has a link to the wiki, but it doesn't have any sort of 'rank' according to how Reddit feels about their trustworthiness.
Forgive me if I've just overlooked something.

Dude. Seriously?

I actually convinced one of my stoner friends to do this. "Yeah man, buy some bitcoins and get your stuff on silkroad". I did this right when silk road was crashing and BTC was on the rise. He bought like a grand of coins and has held on to them since. He was wicked mad at first, then he saw the jump. "Thats the most profitable lie anyone has ever told me."

Aha. I was unaware of this. Thanks for your help!

I'm VERY new to this, but I have question about the different sites available to bitcoin. Say Website/User A is selling bitcoins for 600$, and Website/User B Is buying bitcoins for 650$. Does it make sense to then buy coins from A and sell them back to B to make more money to purchase from A again?
I realize this would require instant exchanges, and you have to take exchange rates and such into account, but this seems like it's too simple of a thing to do. Can someone tell me what I'm missing?

Newb question here, I'm very new to all of this, sorry.
I'm a bit(heh) confused. Some of the people in this thread are talking about coins being bought and instantly arriving. I bought one(my first) on Tuesday,and it's arrival is *next* Tuesday. Until then I cannot buy another bitcoin, it was not instant. Is your first purchase always delayed?

Third question for the day!
I've seen a few services floating about that allow you to buy shares in a mining rig in return for a share of it's BTC output. I'm at work so I don't have any links handy, but has anyone had any experiences with these? Good, Bad? Any recommended sites for it?

This speaks to me on a personal level. I prefer all of my infographics to have a scale based on their relative value to meat.
