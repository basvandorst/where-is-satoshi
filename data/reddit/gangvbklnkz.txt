Trust me, I understand. 
You're being purposely evasive because you don't have any evidence. Because, very simply, if you did have evidence then you would cite it.
You haven't done that yet. And if you had said you couldn't understand code, I would have an alternate reason why you can't cite it. But you've claimed the opposite. So read the code and show me where it does what you say it does.

**You can read law but you can't read code. You're wrong on so many levels.**
**I wrote an entire response to your argument but reddit screwed up the formatting.**
**You can view the full gist [here](
**Good luck with your lawsuit. Not only are you doing something stupid by running to the government, you're also going to lose in court.**
edit: Again I'm being downvoted. How many of you actually read the gist I wrote before you dismissed it? Are you that afraid I might be correct that you won't even consider it?

How is the code you referenced, HACKING THE BITCOIN NETWORK. Once again, you claim to understand code. And I went through it line by line in this [gist](
SHOW ME WHERE THEY "HACK" THE BITCOIN NETWORK. SHOW ME WHERE THEY "HACK" YOUR COMPUTER OR INTERNET NETWORK. YOU THROW AROUND ACCUSATIONS WITH NO PROOF. 
YOU UNDERSTAND CODE. SO REFERENCE WHERE THIS OCCURS.

protected computer ✓
knowingly causes the transmission of a program, information, code, or command ✓
intentionally causes damage - SHOW ME THE CODE THAT CAUSES DAMAGE. YOU KEEP QUOTING LEGAL TEXT BUT SHOW ME THE EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THE ACCUSATIONS YOU'RE MAKING. CONTINUING TO CITE LEGAL DOCUMENTS ABOUT MURDER DOES NOT PROVE A MURDERER IS GUILTY. 
without authorization - !!! This is actually pretty interesting. I think you could make the argument by connecting to peers on the bitcoin network, you authorize the transmission of program, information, code or command. 
Keep trying though.

In that comment and the child comments you made above, you essentially throw around accusations that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was violated but if you read my response and you understand code, I don't get how you can think so. 
It doesn't apply here and you're being very dishonest pretending it does. If you can read and understand code, you should know better.

So how did you not understand what was going on? Why do you continue to say things that aren't true? 
If you can read code, what you're doing is even worse.

That's all you can say in response?
You throw around accusations like you have proof but when confronted you resort to name calling and attacking my post history. 
Stop slandering a man's name and reputation. Very simply, post some evidence. It's really quite simple. If your next response is anything other than proof, i will take that as meaning you have none.

Plenty of legal text citations.
Stilllllllll waiting for PROOF...

Not the ones who really believe in crypto. You sad motherfuckers want to run to the govt to save you yet you want them to not have the ability to shut down bitcoin? 
Get the fuck outta here with your lawsuits. Your threats have no meaning. 
edit: Downvote me all you want. It doesn't matter what my opinion is on the fork. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. YOU CAN'T CRY ABOUT GOVERNMENTS TRYING TO CONTROL BITCOIN AND THEN RUN TO THEM WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG. CAN'T YOU SEE HOW THAT JUST FUELS THEIR ARGUMENTS THAT CRYPTO CURRENCIES NEED TO BE REGULATED/SHUT DOWN?

Haha when you can't show evidence, resort to insults and condescension. 
All you are doing is proving that you're making false accusations without evidence.
