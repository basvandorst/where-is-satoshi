Max block size was not intended by Nakamoto.
POW diff 2 weeks? Why?
Why no more blocks / min? You would need more blocks to get the same confidence, but you do get transactions quicker in the network.

Could do it, but that's not what the majority of the market is using currently. Why is the market using a technology which has, in current state, not the potential to grow big? If more consumers join which want to use it to pay for things, they will soon enough find out that the network can't handle it, because mempool keeps filling up.

They patented a new ASIC miner which has a lower energy footprint. You are basically buying cloud mining with your bitcoin.
If you really want to look into reducing energy usage of cryptocurrencies, you should look at "proof of stake" cryptocurrencies. In these crypto's, mining using ASICs is unnecessary and will not yield any more income. Simply having a computer on with the Bitcoin Core equivalent software will be an actual miner - it does not scale with hashpower.

@_date: 2017-11-06 21:58:14
Sites used to get revenue via advertisements. However, some sites are clogged with ads that users decided to create 'adblockers' which cut the revenue of said sites. So now sites need to find an alternative...
Graphically, mining bitcoin in the background doesn't change the user experience. But sites have to make sure that they don't overload the CPU, because that will also decrease user experience.
Pirate bay has also admitted [experimenting]( with cryptomining as alternative to advertisements.

Why the fuck is the price RISING?
People bought bitcoin for the free altcoin AT the fork. But now there is no fork happening, so why are people BUYING and not buying their altcoins back?
I don't get it. Not that I don't want the price to rise - but I really expected a huge drop now instead of an ATH.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:31:45
Well in order to have access to the 'splitted' coin, you will need the software which follows the 'rules' of this splitted coin: e.g. it will retrieve wallet data from the 'splitted' blockchain, not the original. So if that is what is meant by 'you have to split it yourself' then, yes.
The Replay Attack means that any transaction you make on one chain can also be made on the other chain, since these are valid transactions. 
The assumption that you should wait a bit until miners are done with forking is correct, as far as I know - that's also what I read everywhere. I am not sure why exactly this should be a concern though.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:26:32
HODL! [From 4chan]( We haven't hit the ceiling yet.

The name is Segwit2x, short version B2X.
Due to the nature of the blockchain you automatically get credited on the fork. However, this is only true if you have access to the 'private keys' to the wallet holding these coins. Since Kraken is basically a third party site you will have to figure out *if* what their stance on this is. To be sure that no one can tamper with your coins you should use software where you hold your own private keys, like Electrum (

How does this replay protection work? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:43:34
What is this? This is bullshit.
If this would be the case, then the whole idea behind bitcoin is gone, that there is no centralized authority. 
Let's say that I suddenly build a mining rig which has 10 times more hash power than the current total hash power. What I can then do is simply start 10 blocks behind the current block and start rewriting history.

Seems like a huge gamble to me. This would mean we get a large sell order soon, right?
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:38:13
Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
Bitcoin is gaining a lot of attention. There is currently a fixed amount of Bitcoin in circulation. Every 10 minutes 'miners' process transactions. The Bitcoin software grants them two things: a network fee and a bonus reward for them mining new blocks. This means that every 10 minutes the total 'coins' of Bitcoin goes up, but this rise is not much. 12.5 Bitcoin every 10 minutes, while about 17 Million coins are in circulation.
Since Bitcoin is gaining a lot of attention, people are buying Bitcoin. Since this means converting USD to Bitcoin, this means that the Bitcoin price rises.
Also an argument: there is a maximum number of Bitcoins. At 21 million Bitcoins, none are created anymore. This means that the price of a single coin automatically rises.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:57:37
Sure! I am not an expert though.
Bitcoin's 'heart' is the blockchain: this is a record of all transactions made since Bitcoin started back in 2011. As the name says, the 'blockchain' is a chain of blocks. Every 'block' is a group of transactions, which then have to be 'verified' by 'miners' which solve a puzzle. This puzzle needs a lot of computer power.
Now, every time someone wants to make an 'improvement' to the blockchain, then the 'software' has to be updated. This is called a fork. At the moment this happens, some miners might decide to mine on the new version of the blockchain, others might decide to keep mining on the original. Of course, this is all decided beforehand. The B2X fork is scheduled for a certain block number and miners have already decided wether they will switch or not.
But, since all transactions are kept in the blockchain, and now the blockchain is split, we basically get two coins: the original and the forked coin. Because of the nature of the blockchain, this also means that if you possess the private key to the wallet, you get the same amount of forked coins than the amount of original coin at the moment of the fork.
Since we all know that we can exchange alternative coins to eachother this will also be the case with the new forked coin. Of course, at the time of the fork, you should be aware of possible security issues.

Although Bitcoin Core appears to be a bit conservative and therefore slow, I truly trust them to make the right decisions and test everything before rolling out. You shouldn't invest in any shitcoin, in the end BTC will keep the most support.

No? Everyone can buy an hardware wallet and trade 1 mBTC to that. When handing over the wallet, the 'buyer' can check if there is indeed 1 mBTC on that. Since no one but the owner of this wallet can retrieve the 1 mBTC you have effectively created a 1 mBTC bill. There's no need for a central authority on this.

I'm also using electrum. What we need is a way to access the B2X coins and send them to an exchange so they can convert them to BTC.

If you have the private keys (so you are not using some online wallet or something) then yes, you will get two coins after the fork, the original and the shitcoin =) 
I am not sure if you can sell them back through Coinbase. The problem with Coinbase is that they are, apparently, going to support the shitcoin, so every coin on coinbase will actually be converted to shitcoin. This is exactly the reason why you need the private keys of your coins on coinbase if you have any. 
GDAX will provide a BTC/B2X trade. Take a look here: 
But, be aware of the security risks at a fork! Read about replay attacks! I've also heard that it is not very safe to trade around the time a fork happens (trade in this context meaning making BTC transactions - this of course includes buying/selling BTC to fiat money since this needs a BTC transaction to/from the exchange). I cannot help you with this since I do not completely understand those myself.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:03:20
An interesting question. I'm not an expert but here is my take. 
You know that bitcoins are stored in a wallet. This wallet has a certain key which only the owner should know. Wallets can be created using BIP38 for example, which is a sequence of 12 words.
This raises the question: what if I create a new wallet, write down the 12 words, and now make a transaction of 1 mBTC to this wallet? Now these 12 words are worth 1 mBTC. I could write these on a paper and give them to someone. 
The problem is that I can just copy these words: now the receiver of the paper cannot be sure that I won't spend the coins before they do. Especially not if they cannot check the blockchain when there is no cellular acces.
Another possibility would be hardware wallets. If these create a key which cannot be retrieved from the 'outside' (same as like you cannot obtain a PIN from a SIM card / debit card (at least not as far as I know) then you could give this physical wallet to someone, after of course making a transaction of 1 mBTC to this wallet.
The obtainer of this physical wallet should then make sure, at receiving, to check the blockchain that there is indeed 1 mBTC in the wallet. After that, provided the private key has not been retrieved, the obtainer can always be sure that the wallet is worth 1 mBTC.
The problem here is that probably the cost to make such wallet is fairly large when compared to the value of 1 mBTC.
What is necessary is a way to not disclose the private key, and that the private key is only on one physical location - if that is possible then yes, it is possible to create physical bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-10-29 20:50:20
Yes. 
The idea of the fork is that the old blockchain is used, but the newly added blocks will either be added to the original chain or the new chain (fork). This is decided by the miners: one miner might decide to mine on the fork, while the other mines on the original chain.
This also means that whatever bitcoin you have on the original chain also exists on the alternative chain.
It is nice to know what the answer to a question is, but it is better when you also understand *why* this is as it is. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:23:02
The question is not stupid, as it appears that coins are created from nowhere, right?
Okay. As I said, the blockchain is basically a record of all transactions ever made. Imagine this as a gigantic book where everyone can write their transactions in, and everyone can control that these transactions were valid.
Now, let's suppose that for some reason people decide that we want to make the book page size bigger. Some people want to do this, some people don't want to do this, dividing the community. At some point, a new book is created with a new page size (hence a software update / fork) and every previous transaction is copied in here. From that point, two books (two blockchains / software versions / coins) coexist: people who use the original book keep using their book to write down new transactions while people using the other book will use that one.
In the original / new book you have at the time of the fork 0.5 BTC (thus in your wallet). In the original book you make a few transactions, now your balance there is 0.1 BTC after these. But, these transactions are not made in the new book, as you have decided the new page is bullshit; let's just stick to the original one.
But, if you then decide to make some transaction on the new book, you still find that there are no transactions made in this new book, and therefore that you balance on there is 0.5 BTC!
EDIT: You should read about "replay attacks" - this is a security concern
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:22:48

I'm not sure what to expect. There will be panic, but for how long? It could also be that Bitcoin stabilizes quickly and then the price will probably rise sharply, as it has proven to be able to withstand these 'attacks'. Also keep in mind that you get 'free bitcoin' at the fork if you convert the alternative coin!
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:59:48
Bitcoin is a piece of software. As we all know, software can be upgraded. A fork happens when two versions of software coexist - this is a term which applies not only to Bitcoin, but software in general.
Bitcoin uses a blockchain: a record of all transactions ever made. At the point of a fork, the 'forked version' will also use this blockchain. This means that any transactions made before the fork will also be made *at* the fork. This means that if you own Bitcoin before the fork, you have Bitcoin at and after the fork, but also the *same amount* of 'forked coins' (altcoin) on the new software.
What you currently see is that Bitcoin price rises - one of the reasons could be that people want to get this alternative coin at the moment of the fork, therefore the demand rises. Now, what could happen after the fork? This is just speculating, but here's my view:
There will be panic. The new fork has gained a lot of attention and it appears that a large portion of the community backs the new coin. This means that in general there will be confusion what coin will be the 'real' Bitcoin. In this subreddit, including me, everyone roots for the non-forked coin and deems the fork as an attack. 
Fact is that you will keep both coins and they can be converted in one another via trading platforms.
I'd suggest to buy now, but be aware of a possible large price drop at the moment of the fork: don't panic if this happens and don't invest more than you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:21:48
The heart of the Bitcoin network is the blockchain. This is a record of all 'events' in the network. As the name says, the blockchain is a chain of blocks. Adding a new block (which contains new events - transaction info!) is bound to rules, which is backed by the 'nodes' (computers which host a copy of the blockchain) and 'miners' (computers trying to solve a puzzle in order to create a new block). Therefore, if you want to change the rules of adding new blocks, you need nodes and miners backing you.
A fork happens when (a part of) nodes and miners agree on new rules. For example, the upcoming fork B2X changes the 'block weight'. The nodes and miners agree on a certain time - which is a block number - when they start to deploy these new rules. That means that the next block the miners mine is bound to the new rules.
But look! This means that after this block, two possible 'new' blockchains emerge: both share the same past blockchain, but the new blocks are different in each chain. This is the point where the blockchain has 'forked' into two new chains.
Since the blockchain contains all transaction data this means that if you had any coins *before* the fork, you also have these coins *on both new chains* after the fork!
So, answering your questions:
**How does a fork work**
Described above
**It's purpose**
Miners/nodes want to implement new rules for new blocks, starting from the 'fork point'. Also answers 'why'
**When is the next fork?**
If you want, you can also fork the blockchain, but it's not likely that any node or miner will support you. New forks happen if someone has some rule change proposal which nodes/miners back.
**How to get free coins**
You get those automatically.
However! You say that you hold them on 'localbitcoins' and 'mycellium'. I take these are online wallets. This means you are **not** in control of your coins, and you can also not control what these sites do to them. It might be possible that these sites **convert your coins on one of the 'fork chains' to the coins on the other 'fork chain'**. To prevent this, you should get them to your own personal wallet where you own the private key of!

I'm not entirely sure what you find confusing, could you elaborate more?
Also on the "lazyness" part: while online might be easier, it does not take that long to get your own wallet going on your own PC. If you download electrum the only thing you need to do is to write down 12 words - these 12 words can be used to generate your private key if your pc crashes or whatever. So it's not that much work =)

That would require this person to know the private key of the hardware wallet. If it is not possible to retrieve the private key from the hardware wallet then the funds are safe.
But, thinking about this, I think it's always possible to obtain the private key from the hardware wallet. So I'm actually not sure.
The key question is: why would you want this? Is a hardware wallet a physical item? In the end, they still contain the 'bits' which are of value. The physical wallet itself is of no value.

The first group sees Bitcoin as the first software allowing for money transfers without a bank. This is huuuge!

I use Electrum. Have not used anything else. Reason to choose this is that your local wallet file is encrypted; if someone steals your wallet file it is still useless because they don't have the decryption password. Another reason is that it is open source and supports Bitcoin core.
Moving coins to your wallet means retrieving the keys from the service (coinbase) and importing them to Electrum or any other wallet software.

Maybe this post helps?
It won't double your value. You simply get two coins at the fork; original bitcoin and the Segwit2X (B2X) coin. There's no way to predict what the BTC/B2X rate will be. Expect huge fluctuations around the fork.

Your hard drive shitting yourself is not a problem. If you created your private keys with BIP38 (the 12 word one) then you can just write that down on a paper and your wallet is backed up forever, even if you lose your wallet files.

Ah, I've interpreted 'support' wrong? This means support as in 'technological' support?

How did you screw up? You mean you should've sold now?
I think the main answer is "HODL" here. You can still buy in, of course. Or maybe you want to earn some BTC (if so, PM me).
Mid november we have the B2X fork coming up. If you have any bitcoins when the fork happens, you will also get B2X coins. You can sell those back to BTC again. This will be profitable if the (possible) decrease of BTC is less than the sell rate of B2X. And then still, I am pretty sure that if BTC prize drops it will still go up in the long end.

Why don't you dump a fraction of that into Bitcoin? It stays a risky investment! It would be sad if you would lose your entire paycheck. 
How about a 60$ investment?
