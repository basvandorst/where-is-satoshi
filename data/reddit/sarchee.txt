And they're using a SegWit address. Good ole piratebay

Just bought a miner off someone last night for 0.122 BTC, fee was $1.8. Could have been less, as fees as low as 4-5 sat/byte are being filled.

If you zoom in it says “packages” in small font under Bitcoin.

When you transfer from GDAX, they pay the fees for the transfer. When you transfer from Coinbase, you pay the fees.

“Plans to”
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:27:39
“Keep” working its way up? Bitcoin Cash has been consistently losing value against Bitcoin since BCash was added to Coinbase. Bitcoin has 2nd layer solutions already being implemented on the mainnet. 
Only people using BCash are people buying miners from Bitmain.

Go for an Antminer s7-ln, nice and quiet, only uses about 750w, and is available at a nice markup on eBay at around $1100
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:52:47
And 80% of BCash blockchain nodes will be hosted on Alibaba, as opposed to the ~51% it is now.

So cute when someone responds to themselves with a different account. 
Scam site, do not buy from here!
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:10:28
I'd love one!
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:58:46
"was" being the important word

I believe my node is being hamstrung by my router settings, but the final year of transactions is currently on its second week of syncing. My node was having some downtime here and there of not being able to find any nodes to download the chain from. I'm about 13 weeks out from being totally synced.
Fortunately, as a standalone computer, I can just let it run without disrupting my work.

It’s more secure in that if someone gets access to your ACCOUNT, they can’t simply move your bitcoins out. As the other commenter mentioned, this does nothing to protect you if, Mt. Gox style, the wallets used by Coinbase to store all of their customers coins are stolen. 
This is exactly why I moved to a Hardware Wallet this week. Seeing your holdings increase by thousands over a year makes you more cautious. As such, my relatively meager holdings of lite coin and ether remain on the exchange for now.

False and further proves that you are a scammer. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:56:13
No one buy from this scam company, they’ve been spamming their scam site for weeks on this sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:55:03
Same, check Coinbase. I check at least 15-20 times a day. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:37:29
Perfect answer
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:28:32
some1 is looking to scam lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:41:08
Huh? Elaborate.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:01:26
I set one up on a raspberry PI, 15 weeks remaining!
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:57:40
not to mention spamming tens of thousands of worthless, essentially fee-less transactions on the bitcoin chain
@_date: 2018-09-19 00:25:22
Damnit, I just updated to 0.16.2!
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:03:37
Probably hypnotizes you into giving up your private keys, don't do it
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:48:32
It seems OP thinks we control Mycellium and have the authority to release the bitcoin they deposited there below the "spendable amount." 
My vote is no, we keep our Cabal's scam going and keep OP's deposit.

Everyone hates him because he’s clearly lying about being Satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:12:44
How the fuck does he have applications for “registry” from 2012?? Jesus, patent office should have rejected those immediately.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:57:05
Its resulting in the best prices in months on used miners! So happy I never paid those crazy prices at the start of the year.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:49:18
Now is a great time to buy, with the market prices depressed as a result of the drop in crypto prices.

Avalon's are regarded as more reliable than Antminer's. That being said, my preorder for a December batch of 741's through the US distributor got delayed for three-weeks before being canceled lol. I got a discount on their next generation miner that just started shipping.

Bundy literally did the opposite of the advice above. Didn't pay for what he used AND ignored court orders.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:53:53
Got my raspberry pi 3 running 24/7!
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:44:52
you have a choice, admit to the money laundering or just pay the taxes on the purchase.

Mining is how I acquire my coins. Change address and pool accounts occasionally.
