Unfortuate that the trading world is standing in the way of the use cases for which bitcoin is uniquely qualified to fulfill: handling transaction flows that range from morally questionable (i.e. funding gambling or porn sites) to outright illegal (drugs, murder for hire).
Don't know that it is a great idea to disregard the bread and butter too much, given that alternate uses are not firmly established at this stage.
Remember, porn built the internet...

Both things \*can\* be true at the same time.
For example, God has no intrinsic value (assumption: God does not exist and therefore cannot have value), yet millions of people have been killed over God.

Not quite yet. It's more lamb and moo than lambo and moon at this stage. Trade right and you might make enough for a decent steak for yourself somewhere there...

Like so many things bitcoin, no-one really knows what the impact of an ETF will be. A lot of people were excited about a futures market for bitcoin before one existed. They are (not surprisingly) silent on that now.
But everything is day zero with bitcoin, so really, who knows.
On a side note, I'm amused by the people on here who complain about "whales" manipulating bitcoin down, while in the same breath claiming an ETF is bitcoin's saviour. Always gives me a giggle.

I'd venture there's probably some people who had bitcoin in Mt Gox who might be in desperate need of money :)
I agree with your point, though.

So I've been reading this page for awhile now, trying to work out whether bitcoin is something I should be invested in, one way or the other. My summation of the general arguments I've picked up so far, and my take on them is outlined below.
(a) The payment arguments. That bitcoin could one day be hugely valuable if it were adopted as a day-to-day currency (i.e. use it at the supermarket). The problem I have with this argument is that Bitcoin doesn't seem to provide any great benefit over fiat currency for this purpose; and that it would face stiff opposition from both established players (visa, mastercard) and emergent players (Apple Pay, Google Pay).
(b) The transfer-of-value arguments. The bitcoin could be an effective way to move value from one place to another. This is one that I find somewhat convincing, as it provides a significant benefit over the existing mechanisms for transferring value; for instance, it can be significantly cheaper than something like Western Union. But then, Western Union itself has $7B market cap, Bitcoin $63B. At a glance - and in my highly technical analysis :) - it looks like bitcoin aspires to do more than just this.
(c) The store-of-value arguments. That bitcoin could one day play a role like that of gold. It seems completely unsuited toward this purpose due to the rampant volatility. Why would I ever trust bitcoin for this purpose, when gold has such a well established record?
(d) The speculation arguments. That bitcoin is a good investment vehicle because it attracts speculators which will drive the value up and down. More than any of the other 3 arguments made, this is a proven and strong case for investment in (and out!) of bitcoin, and clearly can make immense profits when it is correctly played.
As a wildcard, illegal activities change all these - we've seen how it can work for cases (a) - (c) through Silk Road, when the more legal options weren't really an option for those involved. But we've already seen a high peak of this kind of activity (at a much lower valuation).
Honestly, given months of reading this, I don't see the value investing case for entering into Bitcoin; likewise I don't want to take the short because of (d) - there's plenty of irrational exuberance out there!
Just thought I'd throw my thoughts out there so people had a change to correct me just in case I'm missing something fundamental. 
So this is probably my last day here. Good luck to all you intrepid travellers on the bitcoin train, hope it treats you well.

LMAO, yeah.
Because if we know one thing about cryptogrip, it's that he doesn't make the same arguments day after day.
After day.
After day.
After day.

The McAfee thing just got too gross to continue to discuss:

Funny, capital gains have not been a major issue for me of late :)

A smart trader can work out how to make money in any market.
All I got from this article was that "Pactum Capital" is not a smart trader.
@_date: 2018-12-02 00:54:54
Let me know shortly before you make said agreement :)
@_date: 2018-12-27 01:54:16
So what's your contention? That people should hold it because it is "solid", even if it never becomes popular and stays at the same price in perpetuity?
My contention would be that if the possibility of it being "popular" at some stage did not exist, it would lose 99% of its value, because I'd estimate that 99% of holders are here for the purpose of investing in something they expect to appreciate significantly.

If the argument is that bitcoin can succeed long term as a store of potential value (i.e. an investment), my answer is possibly. It's certainly done a brilliant job of it so far.
If the argument is that bitcoin can succeed as a day-to-day currency, I'd say that it seems unlikely. What evidence exists that any real inroads have been made in this area? Why would visa, mastercard, the banks, apple and google, etc, with their billions behind them possibly allow this to occur?
@_date: 2018-12-30 22:33:27
Why 6000?

Definitely not in a 2 year timeframe.
There is a world of difference between the existence of quantum computer and the ability to break cryptography. It's estimated that 1500 qubits would be required to break bitcoin cryptography; the big players (IBM, Intel, Google) range between 50-72 qubits at this point, but even at this level, the stability of these computers is highly questionable.
Building a printing press is still a far easier option if one's aim is to generate illicit gains from currency (at least for now).

Zero adoption is a questionable assertion.
But likewise, so is the idea of growing adoption for consumer payments.
Do this: type Coinbase Merchants into google, and go to the page that lists merchants that are using Coinbase to accept bitcoin.
Then actually go to the sites listed there, and see how many actually accept bitcoin.
Hint: It's not pretty.

I don't even think it's a bad thing if they are?
Personally, one of the main reasons I come here for a front row seat to a watch a once-in-a-lifetime revolution and/or shitshow play out.
Probably wouldn't find it quite so interesting if people weren't constantly losing their collective shit at each other. Remember, literally a month ago, bitcoin was "stable" and this board was comparatively empty.
@_date: 2018-12-09 08:12:54
Of course not. Who really needs protecting?
Anyone buys bitcoin at this point in time surely knows the risks. Simply looking at a historical bitcoin chart can tell them that it is a wildly fluctuating beast.
And if they can't be bothered doing even that level of due diligence before investing, there's no need to "protect" them as they'll no doubt find another way to be parted with their money in due time.
