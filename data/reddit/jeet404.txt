Yes thank you! Wow it was early in the morning and I had written the wrong amount to begin with. Man what the heck was I typing. Anyway it is .17-.22 cents is what the average has been for me.

Wow maybe I should just stop while I'm ahead. Let me pull up my bill again and just copy paste it.
 Energy (236 kWh x $.126110/kWh)   $29.76    
 Fuel Cost Adjustment (236 kWh x $.003620/kWh) $.85    
Is my total cost for my last months electricity. So it is cheaper then I thought (I was looking at my yearly average).

They make it safe if you don't have a smart phone to check if the money got transferred. 
When you set up a trade. You will get a code that only you know if the transaction sent. 
So when  you go trade in real life you can just take a simple note and nothing else. The individual selling the bitcoins to you will give you the same secret code once they have sent the bitcoins. If they don't give you that exact code then you know there trying to fraud you.

How is this company not sued to oblivion? I can't believe people have the patience to get pulled around like this. Its been what over a year since people who placed there orders?

Why would he want to say something potentially incriminating. That to me is like asking the bank "can I use cash to buy drugs?".
