You are a sad little person that has a pathological need to evoke negative responses from people in an anonymous environment in an attempt to negate the feeling of utter hopelessness and weakness you experience in your everyday life.  
You express disgust at society at large due to your complete failure to create and maintain any real interpersonal relationships with others due to the fact that people find the way you deal with your social ineptitude unpalatable and repellent. 
Your response to this is to try to demean others intellectually, to elevate your own status in the eyes of others and yourself by what can only be described as mere pedantry.
