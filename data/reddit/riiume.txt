If you could predict market prices you would be retired on your private island surrounded by a bunch of hotties, not trolling comments.
Addendum: if you *truly* believe your prediction, then go to a binary options site like Nadex and place a $50,000 bet that Bitcoin's price will not go above $1000 USD on or before Dec. 31, 2016.
Hell, you could even place your bet on margin (so if you have $50,000, you would be able to place $200,000 bet).
Until you have posted proof that you've placed a non-trivial bet to back your prediction, your post is valueless.

(Preface: I have been using bitcoin for 5 years without any mishaps)
Buy in small quantities so that if an exchange has issues, it will only affect a small portion of what the total you will be buying.
Store the coins locally, such that the "private keys" are stored on your hard drive; e.g. use Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Multibit HD, mSigna, Simple Bitcoin (smartphone), Bitcoin Wallet (smartphone), Mycelium (smartphone).
With these, the ultimate control of the coins is on your physical device, so you can only lose the coins if you someone gets your password.

It's a sort of self-balancing mechanism. If truly "nobody" (except maybe 3 or 4 people or so) were willing to sell bitcoins, then this would necessarily force the price ridiculously high.
We can observe that the price has not gone that high, which means there are people willing to part with their coins at these price levels. 
If these people were going to sell some bitcoin anyway and then buy a coffee using the USD, then they could easily save money by directly buying that coffee with the Bitcoin and not lose money on the conversion.

Hold on! Before we start accusing people of conspiracies against Bitcoin...
I read the draft paper by Hardjono, Smith, &amp; Pentland-- it says nothing about applying their concept (ChainAnchor) to Bitcoin specifically.
All it says is that this _could_ be used to create a workable permissioned blockchain. The assertion that they have plans to bribe miners and subvert Bitcoin is based on unnamed sources who refuse to go on record.
And even if there *were* a conspiracy against Bitcoin, the authors of the ChainAnchor wouldn't necessarily have to be the ones planning it. Someone might just be using the authors of the paper for their ideas.
Sure, ChainAnchor might be cause for a bit of concern, but let's maintain some discernment and self-discipline. Peter, I think you should better qualify your article to avoid creating a witch hunt against these ChainAnchor guys.

One way to do that is with an [OpenDime]( It's like a physical bearer bond for Bitcoin. You can send Bitcoin to it, but the Bitcoin cannot be spent without breaking a tamper-evident seal on the device. 
This guarantees that whoever gave you the OpenDime does not have knowledge of the "secret key" of the Bitcoin on the device. The secret key, or private key as it's called, is like a password that grants control of a stash of Bitcoin.

You buy gift cards using Bitcoin then spend those cards at the local retailer.
Or you load up a [Bitcoin-denominated debit card]( then use it just like you would a normal debit card in the store.
tl;dr - Just as most people normally use debit/credit cards that contain their USD when shopping, people will use debit/credit cards that contain their BTC when shopping.
Inb4 "but retailers aren't HODLing."
Some will (e.g. Overstock is hodling), some won't. It depends on how the volatility of Bitcoin continues to change. In 2012, I remember the price of BTC was MUCH more volatile than it is today by every measure.
Eventually BTC might become less volatile than the USD in which case rational retailers will hodl BTC instead of hodling USD.

Scaling is a **hard** problem. 
Imagine if I want up to a bunch of highly accomplished aerospace engineers, who had Ph.D's and other high professional credentials, founded companies, had many patents, and who are regarded as top tier experts in their discipline, and told them: "Hey, why don't you idiots just add more rocket engines and extra wings to the plane? That should make it go faster, cus more=better amirite? ME SO SMART."
This is what large blockers are doing pretty much.
Large blockers are unwilling to prove that Big-Blocks isn't just a method of kicking the can down the road. They are short-term, impatient thinkers, and they think everything is about **control**, when it's actually all about whichever implementation people voluntarily choose to run on their computing platforms.

Much of that is due to the competitive nature of the crypto market. Try not to take the negativity personally.
Look at it as a sport. You know and expect that the other teams will only cheer for their team, that they will boo when you make a point, that they will try to intimidate and etc. The other team is going to give it their best, and will use all manner of strategies to try to get an edge. This is natural and to be expected.
But the reason you get rewarded as an athlete is for being able to perform under those conditions. If it were easy, then everybody would be rich and there would be nothing unique about being an athlete.
One thing that helps is getting some data streams that are not polluted with opinions and personalities. One such source is bitinfocharts. Specifically, their "[sent in USD]( and "[txns]( metrics. By those 2 metrics, only Bitcoin and Ethereum have any real adoption. While Ethereum does lead in txn count, Bitcoin leads in dollar value sent over a network. If you believe Bitinfocharts is important, I would hold a lot of Bitcoin and also a lot of Ethereum (and the other coins could accurately be described as gambling, according to that data).
When you have those numbers, you see that while there are areas of concern, the picture is positive.
Another fairly neutral metric is Google Trends. Yes, all of the crypto terms have decreased in google trends since last month, but we are actually higher than October and before. So this partly correlates with the relative price decline. If you want a sure-fire sign that things are picking up again, keep track of google trends searches for Bitcoin, Ethereum cryptocurrency, blockchain, etc.
Basically you should separate the emotion and the noise from the pure data because numbers are less likely to cause anxiety/stress.

* On the other hand, Bitcoin **cannot** be shut down.
* IOW, Tether loses its status as "reserve" for traders once it's shut down, which can only possibly benefit Bitcoin.
* After Tether, many independent statistical analyses show that Bitcoin is the least volatile crypto asset.

If you had to open up a new channel every single time, then yes obviously Lightning would be pointless.

Not all libertarians or libertarian sympathizers have announced themselves publicly. The waiter serving a politician his/her breakfast at a local diner, or even that politician's family doctor could have libertarian/freedom leanings. It only takes one.
The citizenry of the US is not powerless against its government:
• In a "civil war", much of the military would side with their relatives and against tyranny.
• Furthermore, the military is quite small compared to the millions of US citizens who own guns.
• Citizens who own multiple guns and explosives could arm their friends and neighbors.
• IOW it would be a clusterf*ck that might end with the a pyrrhic victory for the US gov't, at the cost of destroying the countryside and the US Dollar, and allowing China to take over the world.
There is no calculus under which a civil war does not kill many men, women, and children on all sides and at all wealth levels. Nobody wants that.

All the unique abilities of other coins are being added to Bitcoin via sidechains.

Set up automatic purchases of small insurance contracts against fluctuations above certain percentages within certain timeframes.
Or use a service like CoinJar that  pegs the value of your BTC account to a currency (e.g. USD).
Yes, volatility is there, especially in small-cap markets (like Bitcoin). That's why you would use hedging instruments. If you don't know what these hedging instruments are (or where to get them), then go read a book and come back once you understand. To someone who has traded small cap equities, there is nothing special or unexpected about 60% changes in the value of an asset in the span of minutes.  This is run-of-the-mill, well understood stuff.

Using Bitcoin in some capacity has costs ("more complicated" as you say) &amp; benefits (e.g. unfreezeable, unforgeable transactions that are transparently recorded in perpetuity). Hopefully these businesses have people with the necessary competencies to correctly weigh these costs and benefits and make good decisions.

Price fluctuations happen with the dollar as well-- they are just obscured by the fact that the dollar tends to be used as the conventional unit of account. However, if we say, used gold as the unit of account, then ~$500 would have bought you an ounce of gold in 2000, whereas ~$1000 will buy you an ounce today. 50% loss of wealth (if you were holding cash), how's that for volatility?
Other commodities (and bitcoin is classified as a commodity by the US gov't) fluctuate too. Oil has been as high as $120/barrel and as low as $40 in recent years. This has had considerable negative effects on the shale sector, which unfortunately many states (the Dakotas, Louisiana, etc) have come to be reliant upon for job growth.
In other words: yes, bitcoin fluctuates, just like everything else. That's why you diversify.
@_date: 2015-12-21 17:36:42
I think we should also take into consideration Bitcoin's "corrupting influence". For all we know, there may be high-ranking generals who own 50, 60 bitcoins and are hoping for moon. Or nameless agents employed by alphabet agencies could be secretly hoarding bitcoin while publicly toeing the party line and saying "oh yea, bitcoin, it's horrible, I hate it, totally".
We just have to co-opt/corrupt/steal people so that their loyalty will be to their moon rockets and no longer to their government/bank/etc employers. We already have the documented example of the Secret Service agents who got a hot case of Bitcoin Fever. The untold wealth transfer Bitcoin portends can sway the loyalties of just about anybody. Even US military generals/admirals are often motivated by desire for money, sweet defense contracts, nice houses, etc.

Widespread adoption (especially by business) requires the ability to process **large** (multimillion- to billion- dollar valued) transactions.
Processing large transactions necessitates large market cap in order to avoid hyper-volatility (e.g. to avoid order of magnitude changes in total market capitalization from minute to minute).
Large market capitalization necessarily implies large value per unit BTC (since there is a ceiling to the number of available units).
(Although it's not clear which causes which, we can at least say that price and adoption are positively correlated).

Yes, Bitcoin is tiny. And so is an Ebola virus. Bitcoin has qualitatively different features from other systems, independent of scale or volume.
Ultimately this is about choice. The node operators can choose to run alternate branches of the Bitcoin codebase that use algorithms that only run well on traditional CPUs (rendering all their investments in ASICs, GPUs, etc wasted money).
tl;dr - Mining operations ultimately are at the mercy of the choices that node operators make or don't make.

People who had the intellectual honesty and courage to see the value of Bitcoin and who then put some of their hard earned wealth into Bitcoin took a risk. A risk that many others could have taken but chose to opt out of. What did they do with that extra $100 they couldn't afford to invest in BTC? Who knows. Maybe they spent it eating out. Maybe they saw a couple movies. But that was their choice.
So yes, when/if Bitcoin becomes a bigger part of the global economy, the risk-takers will be handsomely rewarded-- and rightly so.

False analogy. Companies do whatever the CEO says. Bitcoin does not have a CEO (for a reason), and therefore it *intentionally* takes longer for changes to be made to the system.
It's either that, or we risk allowing any idiot to force node operators to adopt code changes and therefore destroy the wealth of all bitcoin users when a rushed update containing errors gets pushed out (which, by the way, happens to many mismanaged tech companies, e.g. Maxis with their latest Sim City fiasco).

If mass adoption were to occur, it would probably not be instantaneous. It would take maybe a week or two.

Gavin has commented on this and said that it's not really technically feasible to introduce ring signatures into the bitcoin protocol, as it would not be compatible with the tens of millions in mining hardware that has already been developed for the Bitcoin PoW algorithm.
However, a possible ersatz solution for Bitcoin is JoinMarket, a decentralized coin mixing service. DarkWallet seems to have been abandoned, and I don't think any new group of devs has moved in and adopted it yet, so JoinMarket is where you should focus your time and donations.

ETFs will end up running a fractional reserve. All the ETFs proposed so far would have been cash-settled, with maybe two exceptions.
With ETFs, gullible users would be led astray into buying fake paper Bitcoins, rather than buying the real deal (i.e. private keys stored on a wallet like Electrum, Samourai, Trezor, Bitcoin Core, Bread, Mycelium, etc.).
The gold and silver markets were mutilated and beaten into submission through fraudulent paper ETFs and futures (100 pieces of "paper gold" for every physical ounce sitting in the vault). Lets not let them have their way with our beloved Bitcoin.

This is a false equivalence to a chicken-egg style paradox. Can you even differential equations bro? 
As adoption gradually increases, block sizes can periodically be adjusted accordingly. This is not difficult to understand.
It is possible that block size will have to go through multiple increases on the way to mass adoption.
Your "chicken-egg" argument is not an obstacle to Bitcoin for essentially the same reason that the Zeno Paradox is not an obstacle to motion.

Bitcoin is voluntary-- the rules of the protocol are there for all to see, there is no secret. People who disagree with those rules are free to form altcoins that aren't "run by governments" or whatever the hell you're on about.
You could even create your own altcoin and then complain about it being "run by governments" because you never know, maybe your mind has been compromised by microwave frequency mind control weapons and you haven't realized it yet, right?
From what I can see, the central banks (especially the Federal Reserve) are pulling out all the stops to boost stock markets and real estate and to deprecate commodities, gold, silver, and bitcoin.

The now-defunct Silk Road and the billions in sales it generated proves that there are consumers willing to spend lots of bitcoins.
Many bitcoin owners are actually "bearish" (they expect the price to go down in the long term), which means they are willing to part with their Bitcoins for a good deal. Just by browsing this subreddit or by browsing bitcointalk.org you can verify that many Bitcoiners are bearish about the price action.
The question is, how to attract the demographic of people who are both spenders and bitcoin owners? What kinds of things does this demographic want?
Corporate entities might be more reluctant to utilize bitcoin for transactions because they are concerned about the complexity of nascent legal issues.
Find out who the people were that were spending billions on silk road, and market a product to them that they want.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:50:25

Yes, but instead of being a matrix of finite rank or countably infinite rank, general "Extensions" can have uncountably infinite (continuum) rank-- a (philosophical) generalization of ["linear operators on a Banach Space"](
Edit: Also, we would generalize from using Z mod 2 (1 = true, 0 = false, e.g.) as the codomain to using more general algebras. For example, T and F can each be a basis vector that is allowed to have coefficients in a field (like the complex numbers), and we take as our codomain the tensor algebra generated by the two basis vectors thus defined.

**Updates:** Merged pull request by github.com/ali1234 which factors the 2 methods into a single file, switching by a command line parameter. See updated examples.
The first script I've added, PrintSegwitSupportingPoolsLast80.py, queries some blockchain APIs in order to generate a list of mining pools who have signalled support for SegWit within the last 80 blocks.
    &gt; ./PrintSegwitPools.py
    
    ['BitFury', 'BTCC%20Pool', 'BitClub%20Network', 'shawnp0wers']
The adding the '-a' parameter causes it to return a list of pools along with their BTC addresses (i.e. the address where their mining profits are currently going).
It works like this:
    &gt; ./PrintSegwitPools.py -a
    
    [('BitFury', '1GbVUSW5WJmRCpaCJ4hanUny77oDaWW4to'), ('BTCC%20Pool', '152f1muMCNa7goXYhYAQC61hxEgGacmncB'), ('BitClub%20Network', '155fzsEBHy9Ri2bMQ8uuuR3tv1YzcDywd4')]

You can still have some power in the network on a reasonable budget: run an (actively used) full node. Run a full node that is always on so that others will connect to it and rely on it for information about which transactions to propagate. During future controversies, you can modify your node to act in a way that supports your favored stance.

Yea, hopefully people eventually realize that there are even better ways to influence the culture of Bitcoin-- one is by donating money to projects, groups, issues they support. 
e.g. If you like Bitcoin-Classic, you should create bounties for open issues in their Github repo. Do similarly to the appropriate Github project if you want to support Bitcoin-Core or Bitcoin-Unlimited.
Also, donate to sites like Coin.Dance if you enjoy being able to keep track of the miner signaling on this issue and being able to see which brand of Bitcoin node people are running.
Then there are newer services like PreferredMiner that can further assist you in promoting your side.

I agree wtih your concerns.
It would be nice to see some indication that the various parties with stake and reputation (miners, devs, businesses, big holders) were **communicating** and negotiating.
Currently, the prediction markets are saying there's a 50% probability of a BTC hardfork in 2017 ([source](
A contentious hardfork will be brutal for business. Miners, holders, businesses alike will suffer should it ever come to that.
More negotiation, more compromising. Maybe package a SegWit+8mb combined hardfork, with the 8mb hard fork code being reviewed and fixed for bugs by the more experienced devs from bitcoin-core repo. Perhaps renaming "SegWit" to "PandaBlocks" or "DragonChain" or "JihanPresentsBitcoinAccelerated". The point is, we need to find a deal that appeals to everyone and preserves the integrity of the core protocol.

It's simple; some of the well-capitalized exchanges (i.e. Coinbase) are operating at fractional Bitcoin reserves, thus artificially lowering the price. If everyone attempted to withdraw their BTC from Coinbase simultaneously, then Coinbase would have to purchase more BTC from real exchanges (BTC-E and localbitcoins), which would break the artificial price ceiling.
Currently, they are effectively and intentionally operating at a loss just to spite Bitcoin's market cap.

Because it's the most competitive &amp; intelligent strategy for vested interests to adopt in order to attempt to squash Bitcoin. Whether this was the original intent of Coinbase's founders doesn't matter; they must function in this way in order to maintain their regulated/compliant status.

Because if they had, the price would be ~$600. If they believe the price is guaranteed to move up, it would be totally rational to spend $700 million to $1 billion on BTC (which would drive the price up significantly more than we've seen). 
And you can't say "But they don't have that much money". If they truly believe what they're saying, they have every incentive to take out huge loans in order to buy what they need to buy until the price is pushed up to their expectation.

Rich people can easily influence the price of market cap because the market cap is still relatively low (it's between $10 to $20 billion).
If Bill Gates wakes up and says "Hmm, I think I'd like to try this Bitcoin thing out that everyone's talking about" and he places a buy order for $50 million on BitFinex, that can cause the price to go up significantly.
Until the market cap becomes large (i.e. comparable to other assets like Gold or Real Estate), wealthy individuals will be able to heavily influence the price.

• Natural gas to Europe via Ukraine being shut off last week and then being rerouted through Greece (with Greece appearing to be on the verge of having a messy divorce with the EU).
• Yield on 30-year treasury continues to edge lower than it has been in decades
• First bull run in precious metals since circa 2011 kicking off midway through last week.

This will not change until some small percentage of people start getting the majority of their paychecks (or business revenue) in bitcoins.
 Then they will need to buy stuff, just as they did before-- except it would cost them extra money to convert to dollars first. Therefore, they will have an incentive to spend bitcoins rather than dollars.
If you want to speed up the process, instead of complaining you can do the following:
1) Next time you give someone a business loan or debt-consolidation loan, make it a stipulation that you give the sum to them in the form of Bitcoin.
BtcJam is a handy service for doing this.
2) If you hire an Indian subcontractor to do some of your software dev work for you, pay him in bitcoin.
3) Offer to donate to charities BUT ONLY if they accept bitcoin.
Summary: Put bitcoin in the hands of people who are not Bitcoin Fanboys; they will want to convert it into some tangible asset ASAP, and this most cost-effective way to do this is through purse.io, overstock, etc.

Instead say, "Bob did Y" (where Y is a specific, provable instance of some behavior by Bob).

Unfortunately a lot of their customers do choose to keep their coins in Coinbase wallets. If all of these trusting customers were to simultaneously withdraw to an external wallet, would Coinbase have enough BTC on hand to execute the transactions?
This could mean there are a whole bunch of people running around who think they have Bitcoin, when all they have is CoinbaseCoins. This could explain why US demand (which has less access to the less corporatized/regulated exchanges) has had an undersized influence on the price for months.

My interpretation is that he means to dissuade the opposition from going forward with SegWit. He's asserting "you will be the minority (hashpower) chain," and then lent credibility to this assertion by demonstrating his ability to instantaneously flip massive hashpower (AntPool) over to BU.
He's also talking up [the damage]( that will be done to the ecosystem (exchanges) should some forking event/s occur.
In my view, he may have one of these 2 possible end goals:
1. Manouevre Bitcoin into Bitcoin Unlimited with minimum bloodshed.
2. Perhaps he actually is being paid (by a government?) to infiltrate and destroy Bitcoin, mining profits be damned.
If (1) is the case, then we don't have much to worry about-- he's doing what he believes will maximize the value of Bitcoin, he's not trying to outright murder it.
If (2) is the case... gird your loins, if you've never experienced war you're about to find out what it's like.

• Even if (for better or worse) Bitcoin Classic predominates, the original Core Devs can still create their own soft forks of Classic (or subsequent hard forks beyond Classic, even).
• What percentage of full nodes are represented by the Bitcoin Classic supporters? If it's a small percentage, then they will still have to convince many full nodes to switch over in order for it to have any traction.
• If Core Devs are this opposed to the push for Classic, I think they should find someone who is partly technical but also has strong public relations skill and business aptitude, and have that person act as their public voice.    
Basically, someone who can go and debate on their behalf in the public fora (e.g. Reddit &amp; Bitcointalk) so that the devs themselves don't have to drain their energy doing something (public relations) likely outside their preferred scope of activity. This person could also distill community feedback and present it in a non-abrasive, filler-free way to the devs.

Unlike Gox, Coinbase runs a solid business: they say upfront how much you're being charged, they let you know about how your information is handled (w.r.t. KYC/AML), etc. 
I'm a core supporter myself but I think your language is unnecessarily divisive. Cite a specific flaw in Brian's argument or move along.

Here is my critique of what you've written: your criticisms may or may not be true, but they are overly reliant on snark and impugning of motives (rather than a detailed discussion of the relative merits of Bitcoin proposals). Though your comments were still civil (albeit not quite diplomatic), which is what we should all be going for.
If you can link me to a detailed essay/white-paper/blog-post wherein you clearly/logically/empirically defend your preferred Bitcoin version, I will give it a read and not argue further unless I have something substantive/specific to say.
A good example of dissenting while remaining civil: Peter Todd did an excellent job at the recent Hong Kong conference in clearly/logically/civilly presenting the downsides of a premature transition to higher block sizes, and his exposition of some alternative methods of scaling (a variation of sharding transaction histories, I think it was). These are the kinds of conversations that should be promoted and exposed to more views as representative of the kind of debate we want to see.

Also the authors of the first article have this to say on building/maintaining business relationships with Chinese businesses:
"(1) Affect, but not the other two instrumental components of guanxi, contributes to improving guanxi;    
(2) a buying firm’s trust in a selling firm contributes to the buyer’s long-term orientation to the seller; and    
(3) a buying firm’s personal trust in the selling firm’s sales manager is a major factor in the buyer’s long-term orientation toward the seller."
(*Affect* was kind of defined as interactions characterized by "attachment, harmony, and long-term relationships by going along with the group".    
*Two instrumental components* were defined as "face preserving and reciprocal favor".)

I'll be honest, it took me about 8 hours to install on windows (due to the absence of certain libraries that i couldn't just run "apt-get" to install, and the need to add stuff to the PATH variable), but once installed it was easy to use and worked as advertised.

Mike Hearn has knowingly and deliberately attempted to tarnish Bitcoin's image in the mass media. He attacked all of us: the devs, the users, the businesses, the miners.
This is totally different from the internal situation with the devs; although they are in the midst of a disagreement, they are not attempting to destroy Bitcoin. They are all putting in their best efforts and passionately arguing their respective cases, which is totally acceptable. 
Mike, however, doesn't deserve the kind of civility we reserve for community members.    
 Unless he unambiguously apologizes for the damage he attempted to inflict (and maybe donates some money to a non-partisan dev fund that doesn't give preference to either camp of devs), he should be *persona non grata* here.
**Addendum**: He also timed the release of his overly-dramatic farewell manifesto to coincide with a major stock market collapse (a collapse which probably could have benefited Bitcoin's market cap a lot more had he kept his mouth shut and quietly exited). What he did was planned, timed, and executed in order to deliver maximum damage to Bitcoin.

Fellow gentlemen,
If you're a big hodler and are concerned about securing your BTC from malware (and keyloggers in particular), then consider buying a Libreboot machine (see thumbnail).
It's a system that has had its BIOS wiped and replaced with Libreboot, a free (in the Stallman sense) and thus open source replacement for proprietary BIOSes. It's called the Taurinus X200 and is hand crafted by the proprietor of the [Libiquity store](
What's nice about this machine:
* Uses a CPU that has been specifically selected for not having any backdoors for remote surveillance (all Intel i5's, all i7's, most Xeon's, and most late-model AMD CPUs since 2010-ish have these backdoors), e.g. no "proprietary blobs".
* The boot partition of the HD has been encrypted, along with the rest of the drive (as far as I know, Libreboot is the only BIOS available to retail customers that is compatible with encrypted boot). *Note: I had to manually reinstall the OS and follow some [detailed instructions]( to make this happen.*
* It supports SSD drives
* There's also a [European shop]( that sells a slightly different model of Libreboot machine.    
They're slightly more expensive, but offer a wider array of hardware customizations.

Still worth it.    
The hashrate can recover. Furthermore, most cryptocurrency ASICs are specialized to SHA-256, so they lack the ability to attack a Keccak-based currency, e.g. 
IOW if Bitcoin forked to Keccak, nobody would own enough Keccak-ASICs to effectively attack it because of the GPU/CPU miniing power that would back Bitcoin-Keccak from day one.
It's either that or get obliterated by the new Bitmain 75% network hashpower farm. I mean, that is game over if it comes online, one man would have the ability to do whatever he wanted with the Bitcoin network.

* What if miners become the biggest stakeholders? Has this situation ever occurred in Peercoin? Or would that be beneficial (miners being long-term hodlers might align their interests more closely with the bitcoin networks)?

The process of finding mixing partners is automated by tumbler.py.

This can be effected without modifying the core protocol:
Encourage wallet providers to plug joinmarket's tumbler API into the back-end of their wallets

Basically, make sure your Environment variables for Python are normal, and make sure you have sufficient horsepower to run Bitcoin Core &amp; a few terminal windows)).    
e.g., a user's coins will automatically and continuously be coinjoined (in a secure, trustless, and well-tested way) for a small fee (something like .0004 BTC per hour. The wallet could include options for setting spending limits on tumbling as well). The fee ensures there are plenty of market maker peers ("coin mixers") running 24/7.

LOL, sorry to say but you are about 4 years too late for a GUI miner to be even remotely competitive with the current mining hardware.
OTOH, you can profitably mine some altcoins (which fluctuate rapidly so you would have to probably switch coins you are mining often) using the hardware you described. Check out coinwarz.com and exclude "SHA-256" from your search (you are pretty much limited to Scrypt and Cryptonote, there might be some others).
Also, regarding OpenCL, it's not supported by all graphics cards. Does your computer have a decent graphics card (e.g. a higher-end NVidia or AMD card?), or is it just the default integrated graphics that come built into the motherboard?

This might not be the most efficient way to do it, but this will work:
* If you are using Bitcoin Core, then disconnect your computer from the internet.
* Attempt to "send" a transaction as you usually would, but in your offline Bitcoin wallet. Make sure the fee is much larger than usual, otherwise your selected mining pools won't accept a strange transaction like the one we're making.
* Go to the Transaction tab and right-click that transaction. Click "Copy raw transaction".
* Completely exit from Bitcoin Core.
* Connect to the internet again. Go to preferredminer.com and paste the raw transaction which you copied earlier.
* Follow the rest of their instructions and you're good to go!

You can short sell ETH on Poloniex and Bitfinex, with around 40% margin (e.g. if you have 5 BTC in your margin account, then you are allowed to short up to 10 BTC worth of Ethereum).
I've tried it, it seems to be a pretty good margin system that Poloniex has.
Clarification: Poloniex has ~40% margin requirement, I think Bitfinex's are lower.

If you bought Bitcoin at ANY time in the past other than perhaps 21 days, you made a profit. I like those odds.
There are no guaranteed payouts in life. Even going to work is a game of probability (after all, there is a nonzero probability you will be run over or shot). All you can do is MAXIMIZE YOUR EXPECTED VALUE. Bitcoin has offered good EV. Yes, some small percentage of days were bad days to buy. But every asset has peaks.

Unless you can perfectly predict the future, use bayesian probabilities. I.e. there are several *likely* (in your estimation) moves the market could make, try to allocate your money so you can make a profit during any of these moves, in proportion to how likely that move will be.
i.e. Determine a good equilibrium given the probabilities of various market outcomes.
Personally, in the past when I've seen indicators that suggested a sizeable probability that they might enter a downtrend, I moved ~75% of my alts back into BTC. It's not an all or nothing game unless you have perfect knowledge of the future.

This will create a Segwit ("P2SH") address-- this kind of address will start with a "3", just like a multisig address.
Then move some funds to this newly created P2SH address. Whenever you send an outgoing transaction from that address, it will send it as a Segwit transaction (i.e. reduced size).

Ah, then it definitely won't support OpenCL. Your most cost-effective option (other than going out and buying one or more GPU's and installing them to your computer) is to try mining coins that are amenable to CPU mining-- coins where the CPU is not at a great disadvantage relative to more specialized hardware (like ASICs, GPUs, FPGAs, etc).
There are CPU coins (coins amenable to profitable CPU mining) like Monero, but I looked up the specs on your computer and its CPU won't help you out there either (because it doesn't have a technology AES-NI that boosts coin mining).
I would say that the system you're describing is not useful for mining.

You can help to move that needle. [This tool]( allows you to restrict which mining pools see your transaction so that it can only be mined by them. This might take longer than a normal transaction to confirm and would require that you include a higher fee, but it's worth it if you want to reward certain miners supporting an upgrade that you like.

Yep-- if you got to Coinbase and buy 1 BTC @ $650, then 90 seconds later you transfer that bitcoin to your Electrum wallet (and the price is $650.02 since it's only been 90 seconds), then are they saying you have a $.02 gain?
so I guess you would owe, what... ~10% of $.02 which is $0.002?
Seems like a good deal for anyone who had a habit of quickly transferring the coins off of Coinbase to a local wallet.

1.a) Form the raw transaction in your wallet software (Bitcoin Core and Electrum can do this) but do not broadcast it to network yet.
1.b) Make sure the tx fee is a little higher than normal to incentivize your target pools to include it.
2) Paste the raw transaction into the corresponding field on preferredminer.com
3) Select which mining pools will be allowed to have an opportunity to process the transaction.
4) Wait (this will take longer than a normal transaction, b/c your selected pools might not be the ones who mine the next block).

It might be an unappealingly high price to many buyers, but there IS a supply as long as my offer is out there. 
The problem you are describing is actually *low liquidity*, which basically means when there is a large spread between the highest bid (price buyer wants) and the lowest ask (price seller wants). Lots of markets have low liquidity (e.g. real estate).

There are a lot of obstacles being intentionally thrown in the way of adoption.
For instance, Google, Facebook, and Twitter blocking "cryptocurrency related" advertising.
Solutions: 
* Camouflage your advertisement so that it's not obvious to the AI filters that what you're advertising is a "cryptocurrency". Avoid using keywords like *bitcoin*, *cryptocurrency*, *blockchain*, *coin*, etc.
* When you hire people for online gigs, arrange to pay them in cryptocurrency.
* Use services like Bisq and Openbazaar (decentralized+p2p, hence physically impossible to shutdown/censor).
* Hide the fact that your product/service uses Bitcoin on the back-end. **Some people are religiously/fanatically opposed to what they think of as "Bitcoin" and get triggered by that word**, so **do not tell them** that their transfers/rewards/etc are being powered by Bitcoin (for irreversibility/security/pseudonymity purposes).
To my eyes, it is obvious that while blockchain is being treated as socially acceptable, there is an attempt to render Bitcoin as controversial or morally bad or such nonsense. We need to be clever and unrelenting in order to work around this cultural opposition.

Yes, well the shortages happen because dealers blindly map their local prices to the "spot price" (which is underpriced).
It makes sense to increase the price of your gold coins when there is a shortage of retail gold in your city/county.
In fact this is the kind of thing I used to do. If I was living in a small town where the 2 places that sold gold (the pawn shop and the coin dealer) were out, well i would list some coins on Craigslist, but at a 30% premium.
Therefore, consumers had 2 options:
• Wait a month for pawn-shop/coin-shop to restock
• Get coins now but at a premium from me
A "LocalGold.com" would simplify all of this. There would be greater liquidity (since all the prices would be listed in one place), so that if a dealer noticed "hey, i'm the only guy within 100 miles who currently has any gold in stock", then that guy will temporarily increase his prices until the situation returns to normal.
Thus, the ability to price correctly will return thereby preventing the man-made shortage scenarios we see today. This means it will be harder for the gov't/COMEX/GLD/etc to lie about how much gold is out there and to pull gold prices out of their ass.

Not really. You do realize that core interest rates are not set by the US Treasury or any other US gov't agency, right? Or are you a simpleton who doesn't understand how the monetary system works and blindly labels anyone who disagrees with your false understandings as a "conspiracy theorist".
Conspiracies exist. Whenever people work together to cheat at casino games (which obviously has happened many times), that is a conspiracy. When Martha Stewart engaged in insider stock trading in 2002 (\[[1]( that was a conspiracy. The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments (\[[2]( \[[3]( \[[4]( are an objectively proven conspiracy that the US government has actually admitted to, whether you like it or not.  
**Conspiracies do exist** (much to your chagrin), and it is good that there are people out there theorizing about them. Of course, that doesn't mean all theories are created equal-- some conspiracy theories have great merit (physical evidence, witness testimony, etc) whereas others do not.

I've done 70+ trades on LBC without encountering any "scammers". Maybe you should check the trader's reputation score before doing business with him/her next time?
**Edit** - yes, yes, I realize people can sell accounts. The thing is, it takes a **long** time (and a lot of money/bitcoin) to build up a high-reputation account, and you can only sell it once.
Thus, statistics dictate that you are unlikely to randomly encounter high-rated accounts that are willing to trash themselves by behaving badly.
Of course there are exceptions-- the way you mitigate this is by executing a large number of small transactions (and downrating anybody who rips you off for chump change), rather than one or two huge transactions.

True-- then we need to work harder to show people uses for Bitcoin.
• Example: In my country (USA), online gambling using US dollars is *illegal*, so the way I'm able to play online poker is through Bitcoin. There is a thriving and amiable community of Bitcoin-based US poker players who would welcome new members.
• Example: If you're under 18, you can still trade the traditional stock market (GOOG, AMZN, etc.) through Bitcoin via sites like SimpleFX and 1Broker.
• Example: If you're an entrepreneur and you need to hire offshore gig workers for certain tasks, then Bitcoin is by far the easiest way to pay them with no red tape.

• Regulatory capture (Treasury Secretary, SEC employees, etc go straight to work at Goldman Sachs after leaving government (as payment for looking the other way while GS, JPMorgan, etc launder drug money (or just giving them a nominal fine of one day's profits) and generally fuck the American people).
• Lobbying for artificial/unnecessary barriers to market entry (to suffocate smaller companies who dare to offer a superior product/service at a comparable price).
• Using the IRS as a political weapon to target specific people they have personal grudges against.
• And much, much more :)

Surprisingly, it is almost unprofitable to counterfeit gold coins. 
Bars/ingots usually have simpler engravings/decorations, a simpler shape, and you get more ounces of fake gold per successful counterfeit bar.
Coins, on the other hand, are so small that it's much easier to make mistakes, they have complicated engravings on both the obverse and reverse, and if you do manage to successfully counterfeit one copy of a coin, that's a very small number of ounces.
During my life I have bought and sold tens of thousands of silver and gold coins, and only come across one counterfeit coin. Those are some good odds.

Hi all, I tried cross-compiling (using a debian virtualbox within my windows machine), but failed (the output binaries for some reason were lacking the ".exe" extension, and threw an error when i moved them into the windows host system and attempted to run them).
Anyway, the OP link (towards the end of superresistant's post) links to a binary with (presumably) checksums of some type.

This is what Bram Cohen's MR POWA is designed to prevent. Here's how I understand it:
1) UASF flag day; 30% of miners stay, 70% fork their mothers onto BTU coin.
2) Some of the BTU miners temporarily dip back into BCC in order to boost the difficulty. Once the difficulty rises, they leave the BCC chain.
3) The pro-segwit miners on BCC have a lot of trouble mining at the elevated difficulty.
**4) We flip the switch (in Bitcoin core 0.15.0 UASF+POWA) that causes the accepted PoW to change from 100% SHA256 to 50% SHA256 and 50% Cuckoo Cycle**
5) Mining is slightly slower for one difficulty adjustment period, but from then on the CPU+GPU miners managing 50% of transactions are immune to Bitmain difficulty attacks.
But yea, you are correct that this would require everybody to upgrade their full nodes to this hypothetical "Bitcoin core 0.15.0 UASF+POWA" node.
We would need lots of tech support people guiding and assisting all of the businesses, merchants, exchanges, 3rd party wallets to ensure they have minimal turbulence throughout that transitioning period.
If we cross that threshold alive, then I think the Bitcoin would finally be able to cannibalize the market caps of high speed payments companies like MasterCard+Visa+CapitalOne+etc.

Your funds can be removed manually without needing to send--
use the "Export Private Keys" feature. You can find explanations of this in the Unsystem wiki and on message boards.
Basically, when you export private keys from your Dark Wallet, it gives you a file containing your bitcoin... you can then import this file into a new wallet like Multibit HD or Bitcoin Core. Once you have done this, you should delete the export file. Your bitcoins now belong to the new wallet.

No investment has guaranteed returns.
US stocks are a gamble. Emerging market stocks are a gamble. Real estate is a gamble. High-fee managed funds are a gamble.
Of course, everyone has justifications for their little investment strategy ("Dow Theory", "Technical analysis", "muh stocks always go up"). And those theories might work for a century (East India Company stock) or two (the Pound Sterling as world reserve currency), but subsequently fail.
Furthermore, there doesn't exist a one-size fits all investment strategy (are you 5 years from retirement? Or 30 years from retirement? Because you would want different assets depending on which situation you were in).
Then there are black swan events that can end/alter patterns that may have lasted for centuries (e.g. World War 2 and the subsequent restructuring of commerce).

Yes indeed, for instance the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, [which have added something like 10 trillion USD worth of equities to their balance sheets]( (i.e. bought stocks using the freely printed money ("quantitative easing")), thus diluting the value of the dollars which people who work for a living must use.
It's also very clear that the bogus asset bubbles and subsequent bailouts were due primarily to misallocation of stolen wealth via central bank operations (low interest rates, quantitative easing, open market operations. Fancy words for "printing money and handing it to Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, et al.").

To be more specific than my other answer:
The cottage industries I refer to are things that the best AI still does not excel at. Things like diplomacy, original/creative art, crafts, complex systems where the rules are not fixed or multiple conflicting rulesets are in play (i.e. running a sports team, being a therapist, urban planning, in fact most applied science fields where reality is messier than theory), humor.
AI is actually exaggerated and overhyped. True, people have made progress in image processing (specifically edge detection, object classification to a lesser extent), deep/iterative learning (on a highly restricted game or domain), language processing, etc.
But these are all very, very specific forms of information processing. General artificial intelligence is a long ways off. The so-called AI "robots" are basically just language processing machines with some cosmetics to resemble the human form. They cannot integrate seamlessly into society and perform the thousands of daily tasks-- taking care of family, setting priorities, observing local rules of etiquette and unspoken customs, reacting to surprising/unexpected situations (e.g. if someone throws a ball at you, if someone gets angry at you, etc.).
AI is nowhere near where "they" say it is.

There would be less loss of purchasing power through money printing. Then the savings of the more ambitious working class members would provide the resources to start their own small businesses, to specialize in a vocation, or to train other blue collar workers in vocational skills.
Instead of people working like interchangeable cogs at Wal-Mart or Amazon warehouses, they would be working for more specialized local cottage industries. Would you rather work as a local furniture repair guru or as a greeter at Wal-Mart?

Not necessarily. Some of the actors within the Bitcoin-sphere might be *willfully seeking to destroy Bitcoin* to advance ulterior motives (i.e. actors who are paid off by the CCCP or PBOC or some other authoritarian entity that harbors strong hostility to a free Bitcoin, and who therefore want the price of BTC to go to $0).
Then there are people who have been successfully propagandized by these corrupted actors.
**2X makes forceful censorship of the Bitcoin network exponentially easier**.
I make it my  job to understand these issues because I own a shitload of Bitcoin and want to increase the value of these holdings.
If you own fewer than ~50 Bitcoin, you are probably not "highly invested" to the point where you spend &gt; 20 hours per week every week studying issues affecting Bitcoin: reading papers, studying/running code from Github repos, weighing opinions of various highly reputable+accomplished contributors, etc.
I give great weight to the opinions of proven contributors and solvers of very hard problems. That means people like many of the Core Devs, and to a certain extent entities from outside of the Bitcoin ecosystem (e.g. Nick Szabo) with hefty &amp; well-earned reputations.
These proven/reputable people are mostly opposed to Segwit2X. **Give me a list of the best subject-matter experts who support 2X**, and I will give you a list of higher experts who reject 2X.

You can sell products anonymously on [OpenBazaar]( or the [DarkNetMarkets](

There are also many new lines of business that are made possible by Bitcoin (e.g. [trustless internet notary]( online gambling in places where banks are prohibited from processing deposits to gambling sites, etc.).
So one option is to think up a new business type that was not possible prior to cryptocurrencies! Obviously this is difficult (if it were easy, everyone would be a wealthy CEO at this time), but if you have the skill/aptitude/connections you might be able to do it.

Also, when I need to get someone from Craigslist to do a gig for me, I pay them in Bitcoin (and then rebuy more Bitcoin to replace what I spent).
IOW some people will spend more BTC, some people will spend fewer BTC, depending on what proportion of people think BTC is overpriced vs underpriced.

Globalists dislike bitcoin.
If it were economically/technologically possible to deactivate Bitcoin, they would have already done so in the 8 years Bitcoin has existed (central banks have been writing about Bitcoin since at least 2013).
They are supremely greedy and intelligent, they do not allow competition to exist. Goldmoney was neutered by them, Liberty Dollars were raided and shutdown. If they could invent a technique by which to shut Bitcoin down, they would have.
I think many governments have analyzed Bitcoin and come to the conclusion that it is unrealistic to try to "shut it down" without destroying their own domestic GDP, so instead they are trying to find ways to profit off Bitcoin (i.e. by having exchanges that they can tax and make millions or billions off of every years).
To summarize: 
 The country with the best exchanges gets all the sweet, sweet, tax dollars.
And until countries stop liking tax dollars, statistically they are likely to want to have exchanges. China is effectively saying "fuck tax dollars, we hate money".

Meh. I don't know. For example, I've read some of Emin Gun Sirer's writings, and he's quite sharp. Sometimes smart people will intentionally deceive and harm the public in exchange for financial/egoic remuneration. 
Garzik on the other hand, doesn't strike me as being motivated by ego. His communications of late have been succinct and unelaborate-- no self-aggrandizement. I think it is more likely he might be under some form of coercion. Has anyone seen him in public recently?
Finally Jihan Wu... he *does* have a sense of humor, and is even willing to joke about himself and look past personal slights-- i.e. he's not motivated by mere pride or quick profit. He's just an extremely motivated business man, whose incentives currently conflict with the open nature of the original Bitcoin.

So like, the guy who invented CoinJoin (Greg Maxwell) which is used by dozens of privacy altcoins and also by Joinmarket, he opposes 2X.
The inventor of Segwit (Pieter Wuille) opposes 2X. Segwit allows Lightning Network and it has been adopted by another top coin, Litecoin, and is also used in Vertcoin, Syscoin, Digibyte, Groestlcoin, and possibly others.

Even 10,000 is well within reason, imo; In order to reach this level, Bitcoin would only need to take over a larger share of global remittances and black markets (which it is gradually doing anyway) (to see what i'm talking about, go [here]( then push black market to 25% and remittances to 30%).
Remittances is tricky b/c of the need to comply with local regulatory regimes (since you'll probably need a brick-and-mortar "storefront" to interface with the clients in this line of business). Also, getting immigrant workers to trust Bitcoin over alternative methods of sending remittances is difficult.

Your analysis is naive; here's what you're missing:
* "Governments" of the world are made of officials. Many of these officials have already been **co-opted** (i.e. they're hodlers and want to 100x their wealth via Bitcoin and not have to show up for boring government job anymore)
* Bitcoin will become wealthier than governments (it's already wealthier than many small nations). It might eventually indirectly control many military and strategic assets and people.
    - Indeed, people who are involved in Bitcoin (but haven't made their involvement publicly known) will have **strong incentives to quietly neutralize** any leaders who start making noise about "opposing Bitcoin".    
Specifically, there are military veterans who are hodlers and people with shit-tons of money, real-estate, weapons caches, etc who are hodlers. These groups, like all hodlers, are strongly incentivized to protect their economic interests.
* To deactivate Bitcoin, you pretty much have to shut down the internet. Perhaps that is was China will do. In any case, **billions of people will die of starvation, disease, and civil war if the internet is shut down** because so much of modern industry and commerce is fully reliant on the internet for coordination, supply chain logistics, etc. Cutting your GDP in half is suicide.

Meh, I do believe many markets are manipulated (e.g. the paper precious metals markets are bullshit, their bluff is gradually being called by China's deep appetite for taking physical delivery on their contracts though).
However, from my observations, the Bitcoin markets are not heavily manipulated yet. Oh, there are occasional little pump &amp; dumps, bear whales, and so on, but that's just normal market action.
When I say *manipulated*, I am talking about governments using proxies (e.g. Goldman Sachs) to short an asset with 150x leverage, or when exchanges become complicit and begin to refuse to deliver the asset (e.g. instead of giving you your bitcoins, they would say "ruh roh! we just ran out of bitcoins! Guess we will just send you a check for an 'equivalent' value in USD (according to an exchange rate that favors us, of course).")
BTC is where it should be-- it has a great future, but right now its level of day-to-day use would not justify a "to-the-moon" price level ($10,000 or whatever).
If you like Bitcoin, and are getting impatient, then here are my suggestions:
1) Get involved in Bitcoin businesses.
2) Learn to program, learn some mathematics, and find ways to contribute to the furtherance of the crypto world.
3) Go to BTCJam and try loaning some businesses your bitcoin; this way you can get 2% to 40% monthly interest (better than any savings account or certificate of deposit).
In fact, when you loan your bitcoins out, you are contributing to the increase in demand for BTC (you loan out principal, the borrower must repay principal X BTC *plus interest*-- where the additional demand comes from).
So not only do your BTC go up in value, but you also get interest for your calculated risk!

The OP means 1 million in 2015 dollars (yes, inflation is a thing. No, you are not clever for knowing what inflation is). Well, for this to happen, the market cap of Bitcoin would have to be 21 trillion 2015 $'s. For comparison, the total market cap of all companies listed on the NYSE exchange is approximately 16 trillion 2015 $'s.
For another comparison the total market cap of all (extracted) gold in the world is around 6 - 7 trillion (2015) USD.
So, if you think the Bitcoin network will have ~ 3 times as much value as the world's gold reserves, or if you believe that it will have a bit more value than all companies on the NYSE, your answer would be yes.

Calls for some Plathposting:
**The Moon And The Yew Tree**
This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary 
The trees of the mind are black. The light is blue. 
The grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if I were God 
Prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility 
Fumy, spiritous mists inhabit this place. 
Separated from my house by a row of headstones. 
I simply cannot see where there is to get to. 
The moon is no door. It is a face in its own right, 
White as a knuckle and terribly upset. 
It drags the sea after it like a dark crime; it is quiet 
With the O-gape of complete despair. I live here. 
Twice on Sunday, the bells startle the sky -- 
Eight great tongues affirming the Resurrection 
At the end, they soberly bong out their names. 
The yew tree points up, it has a Gothic shape. 
The eyes lift after it and find the moon. 
The moon is my mother. She is not sweet like Mary. 
Her blue garments unloose small bats and owls. 
How I would like to believe in tenderness - 
The face of the effigy, gentled by candles, 
Bending, on me in particular, its mild eyes. 
I have fallen a long way. Clouds are flowering 
Blue and mystical over the face of the stars 
Inside the church, the saints will all be blue, 
Floating on their delicate feet over the cold pews, 
Their hands and faces stiff with holiness. 
The moon sees nothing of this. She is bald and wild. 
And the message of the yew tree is blackness - blackness and silence.

Doesn't help them if they don't know who or what did the metaphorical "striking". I guess they could pass a Patriot Act 3, but they're doing that shit anyway, so who cares.


Striking does not need to necessarily be physical/kinetic violence.
It could entail blackmailing a high-status individual with surveillance photos of them molesting a child, for instance.
Your definition of "strike" is too narrow.


Personally I enjoy hurting my enemies because it's fun and I derive sexual satisfaction from doing so. It just so happens that my enemies are those people who attempt to destroy Bitcoin. Good luck stopping me :3
Also, (not that I'm defending violence, but) if violence "doesn't work" as you say, then why does the US use violence every chance it gets against Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, etc? They sure seem to think "violence works".

Bitcoin shouldn't rely on the law for protection.
If CoinWallet's spam is truly so horrible, then take action to deal with it. Actually, some miners are already filtering out CoinWallet's transactions, which response some have argued is already an overreaction.
Alternatively, you could download bitcoin node and miner software and find ways to improve it such that it is not hindered by stress tests of this level.
Or you could use some form of coercion against the people behind CoinWallet (I'm not saying you *should* do this, I'm just pointing out that you theoretically *could*, and there wouldn't be much I or anyone else here on r/bitcoin could do to stop you).
Bitcoin's primary defense should be its mathematics/mechanics and secondarily how it balances financial incentives... which yes, could mean that there are financial incentives to "go after" known enemies of the BTC network once they reach a certain threat level (a level justifying the expense and risk of "going after" someone).
\*Disclamer: By "go after" and "use coercion" I am not endorsing or suggesting that anyone should violate any domestic or international laws, treaties, UN Charters, accords, etc.

The best way to persuade the miners to discontinue this kind of activity would be to give them a convincing proof that continuing the activity will ruin their profits (factoring in the time value of money (current profits are weighted more heavily than future profits)).
For instance, putting together a simulation of the whole Bitcoin system (using reasonable approximations and assumptions); see if the simulation predicts miner profits will be destroyed due to selective transaction censoring of the type we witnessed today. Have some other experts review your simulation and give you suggestions for tweaking/improving it. Run some controls to make sure the profit destruction didn't have an unrelated cause.
Document the results of the simulation, put it all in a nice, 50-page white paper, and send a copy to the management of each mining organization. Maybe follow up a bit via email so that they remember to look at it.
tl;dr - words are usually cheap, words backed by {empirical data + cogent analysis} have value.

**Real Reason the businesses you know about follow regulations:**
Most VC's are high-profile and legally compliant. Thus, if you're creating a startup and wish to attract VC money (which most startups do in the 2010's), you have to play by the VC's rules. And the VC's will demand that you conform to regulations so that you do not end up becoming a liability for them.
There are, however, a lot of "unregulated" businesses; they just don't refer to themselves as businesses or make a big fuss. They intentionally avoid attention from anyone except their niche of customers, and obviously have the wherewithal to develop themselves without help from big money.
In other words, they're out there but they are obviously not willing to do interviews with *Business Insider* magazine or create glossy eye-candy websites that would attract too much mainstream attention.

This is a canard. Altcoins do serve a purpose-- they motivate Bitcoin to avoid complacency, and to expand its feature set. Whenever Bitcoin adds a sidechain that performs the function of an altcoin, it gets to eat a sizable chunk of the altcoin's market cap. This is a good thing, and the most likely outcome (since the most devs and other experts are working on improving Bitcoin) is that Bitcoin will assimilate the altcoin rather than vice versa).

Mike, you should propose a follow-up conference where the decision-making process *will* be discussed, as well as the other issues you've wanted to put onto the agenda.
If some subset of developers should boycott your follow-up conference, it would be seen by the majority of stakeholders (miners, hodlers, btc businesses) as an act of intransigence and likely cost them much of their support. Thus they would find it almost necessary to participate in your decision-making conference.

You are conflating credentials with knowledge. Credentials may *signal* knowledge (assuming they aren't from a shit-tier school or fraudulent), but they are not knowledge in-and-of themselves.
A man may have a Ph.D. but may later succumb to Alzheimer's or Dementia. He still has the Ph.D. but likely is no longer much use in terms of actually practicing that discipline. This is a simple example where credentials and knowledge do not line up.
I am belaboring the point. On to the next:


The question is not "are you steeped in knowledge pertaining to Alchemy", the question is "Is Alchemy going to increase the productivity of our society?"

My point is that I think most Americans don't understand what the Federal Funds rate is, why it's at near-zero for the past 2 years or so, and what that means for the wealth disparity in this country (the 0% loans aren't going to middle class professionals or small business owners, they are going to over-privileged too-big-to-fail member/shareholder banks of the Federal Reserve system, and subsequently being dispersed to secondary financial institutions (which are just as over-privileged)).
If the general public were presented with this information in an easily digestible form, they would find it disturbing and conspiratorial.
Yes, definitely the Federal Funds Rate is a core variable in many financial models, the partial differential equations used to devise optimal wealth utilization. Just goes to show what outsize influence the whims of a single, imperfect person (Janet Yellen, currently) have on the market.

This is why hodlers would do well to tip &amp; donate media personalities who support Bitcoin. Here are some publicly supportive people and groups I have either tipped or would like to tip in the near future:
• Andreas Antonopoulos    
• Mises Media (they accept bitcoin donations and they frequently cover Bitcoin)    
• ZeroHedge (they don't have a listed BTC address, but you can ChangeTip them via Twitter)    
• vention1mgtow (of youtube) - He's sort of a "Man-o-sphere" guy that teaches younger guys how to save money, avoid traps, build respect for themselves, etc. He also frequently discusses the benefits of Bitcoin with his audience.    
• Patrick Byrne &amp; Overstock.com - Buy from them instead of Amazon, as they have created a lot of publicity for BTC, they accept it, and they invest in ventures relating to it.    
• Clif High of HalfPastHuman - He's sort of a modern Nostradamus. He is extremely popular with his niche audience, and he sometimes discusses Bitcoin and its advantages.
If you feel this list is missing anyone, post and I can add them!

Yup, it is true that depending on the borrower's purpose with the loan, there might be additional costs (currency conversions, etc). If the costs are too high, then the borrower will opt not to borrow, simple as that. However, we can observe (by browsing the lending history at BTCJam, for instance) that, for many people the idea of borrowing bitcoin has made sense, and that they have managed to pay back their creditors in full.
Personally, I have no use for a Bitcoin loan. I just observe that there is currently a demand for Bitcoin loans, and I evaluate the creditworthiness of the potential borrower (I'm not going to lend 50 BTC to a guy who hasn't posted his pay stub, verified his credit card info, and established a history of paying back loans on the order of ~50 BTC).

Nothing is stopping VC's from getting together to create a Bitcoin Bank that is fully compliant, pays its taxes, registers in the US as a Corporation, and is generally above board.
If there is truly a demand for that service (and people aren't just talking out of their asses), then people will be willing to pay for it, and therefore the service will assuredly be created.
Actually, a better concept might be to create a company that offers **Bitcoin insurance policies**. You apply for a policy, and after "proof of ownership" of your bitcoin, you receive an insurance policy. There are some technical details that need to be worked out (avoiding fraud, proving that it was indeed *your* bitcoins that were lost and not somebody else's, etc. Basically *proof of loss*). But if it were easy, it would already have been done and therefore there would be no opportunity left in that niche.

Nope. Openbazaar is a p2p protocol (just like Bitcoin is a protocol). If you don't like the default OB client, you are free to fork it and make any tweaks you so choose. Your ability to connect to the OpenBazaar p2p network does not depend on receiving permission from any corporate entity.
OB1 is a company the offers services *surrounding* the OpenBazaar network, but the core of the network does not require OB1 in order to exist. Just like Coinbase offers paid services to do with Bitcoin, but Bitcoin the network does not require Coinbase in order to exist.

My point is that during an *emergency*, you will not lose your bitcoins (because they are stored on your machine, not "in the cloud").
Hopefully after a few weeks the emergency will pass, and you will once again be able to secure an income or move in with family, thereby regaining your internet access.
Yes, obviously not having money to afford utilities is a bad thing, and people try their best to avoid ending up in that situation. As of right now, however, the median American household can still afford internet access (either via land connection or mobile service).
If we are talking about a Mad Max future where only 2% of people have internet, then your USD would also lose their value (look at what happened to Germany's currency after being crushed in WW 1, or to the value of the Roman antoninianus as the empire collapsed). 
In this case, it becomes a nontrivial problem to predict what monies will retain/gain value; I feel comfortable betting on gold/silver for provincial areas, bitcoin for places where technological civilization maintains a foothold, and bitcoin again for international commerce (or what remains of international commerce). (Obviously foodstuffs will continue to hold value but they do not satisfy the desired money-like properties (uniformity, divisibility, portability, etc))

Yes, harassing people who obey the law in order to protect their money is kind of like some of the "unwritten" KYC/AML violations here in the US. If you withdraw an amount of money to cash that is under the legal daily limit of $10,000, then you can still be investigated. e.g. If you withdrew $9,999, there's nothing illegal about that, but it's still regarded as "suspicious" or some bullshit. They call it structuring your withdrawals, I call it "it's not illegal so get off my back!".

One subtle aspect of the current US economy is that although we're technically not in a recession, the workforce participation rate (which includes so-called "discouraged workers" and the long-term unemployed) is at a historic low. The low nominal "unemployment rate" of ~5% is used to hide the suffering of the ~24% long-term jobless, working-age, able bodied, non-student population.
Interestingly, violent crime has declined massively since even the 90's (we just get more media coverage of the violence which does occur). It says that Americans are statistically not choosing to resort to violence when they are hitting hard times, which speaks well of us.

Or, would it be possible to create a scheme (after getting the consensus of the miners) to buy up, say, 80% of Monero, then make all Bitcoin redeemable for Monero at a fixed, proportional rate.

@_date: 2017-05-30 21:30:59
Yup, but this won't become apparent until the blockchain size and transaction count of Ethereum starts to reach its limits; it already has less full node decentralization and larger blockchain size than Bitcoin (which makes it vulnerable to e.g. Sybil attacks and possibly others).
To increase its competitiveness, Bitcoin needs to start **onboarding companies onto RSK ASAP** (onto the Ginger testnet, and later onto the mainnet once it goes live in approx. one month). The ETH community has been very accommodating (their foundation members actually provide consultations and guidance to companies thinking of using the Ethereum chain for their tokens), but I know we can be even more accommodating to prospective users!
The market is saying "we want smart contracts, we'll give you lots of money if you have them", and RSK fortunately delivers this to them. Do not ignore the market!!! When Ethereum begins to experience congestion, we can take some of the overflow.
Ethereum will fight Rootstock and attempt to besmirch it, as they should (but not to the extent of looking vindictive). Bitcoin community members should be prepared for a PR/marketing battle to advance RSK.
Finally, I'm aware that Rootstock is owned (partly or wholly) by Bitmain. But this is a common interest, and we should not let the other controversies (scaling) interfere with our business logic. **Rootstock is good for Bitcoin**, do not allow your emotions to override your logic and cause you to dismiss it out-of-hand simply because of the personalities involved with it.

It's a future event hypothesized by certain economic analysts (Jim Rickards, Marc Faber, others). It's the view that world currencies are becoming unstable due to mounting debt crises (e.g. Greece, Puerto Rico, etc.) and the East creating independent pricing mechanisms for traditionally Western-governed commodity markets (e.g. the Shanghai Gold Exchange is taking control of the "gold price fix" from US futures markets and ETFs). The upshot is expected to be a new reserve currency, starting from scratch if you will (by backing it with gold to get it kick started).

[Rootstock]( is creating a provisional scaling solution--
They are creating a token called **RSK** (which has been under testing since 2016 and is working so far).
1 RSK = 1 BTC and can be converted at any time. The only difference is the RSK chain can process hundreds times more transactions per second than the main BTC chain.


tl;dr - If you're okay with *slightly* less security, RSK is coming out which basically allows you to cheaply and quickly send bitcoin around.
BTW, you can run the test version of RSK right now-- it's one of the sub-wallets in [Jaxx](

Bitcoin won't help you get rich quick. It can be useful for the its un-censorability (nobody can block you from sending Bitcoins to someone or to some business. For instance, when all the major corporate payment systems blockaded Wikileaks, Bitcoin was still a valid method of sending them donations) and for its programmability (trustless multi-signature accounts, which never existed before). There are many ways to program a bitcoin transaction (you can program a bitcoins to remain "locked" for a certain period of time before they become accessible (e.g. a programmable trust fund). Also, objective "proof-of-existence" is now possible (basically, you can encode and submit a document into the Bitcoin blockchain, and this acts as notarizing the document (because the blockchain cannot be "back-dated" or reverse engineered due to the strength of its encryption)).
And of course, if you are a business person, there are no chargebacks with bitcoin (yay!) and instead of paying 3% tribute to a credit card company, you just pay a flat ~5 cent transaction fee.
tl;dr - Bitcoin has unique uses and properties that are not exhibited by traditional money or even by gold.
Bitcoin can help you, but it won't do 100% of the work for you. However, it has made new business models possible, and you could potentially create or get involved in one of these businesses:

Take a deep breath, everything is under control:
* You don't have to necessarily worry about BCC/BitcoinABC unless you are curious. It's a new &amp; separate coin being spun off from Bitcoin, and it will be called "Bitcoin Cash" (BCC).    
You don't have to do anything, your Bitcoin holdings will be entirely unaffected by BitcoinCash. This has been planned out well in advance to avoid any conflicts, and everything is working correctly.
* Regarding Segwit2x/BIP91 -- this has been successfully locked and is now in effect. No action is necessary from you in regard to this. The point of Segwit2x is to pave the way for Segwit activation (it was a necessary intermediate step for complicated political and technical reasons).
* Segwit - Miners have finally consented to activating Segwit, as can be seen [here]( and [here]( In approx 2.5 weeks, Segwit will go into effect.
* The probability for something to go wrong is small because there is now a big financial penalty for pulling out of the activation. Since about 2 hours, any miner who fails to adhere to the activation schedule is being ignored by the overwhelming majority of the network (i.e. they don't get paid if they don't play by the rules).

I'm not discounting the value of academic credentials, if that's what you're trying to get at. If I believed that, I wouldn't have wasted 4 years of my life getting an MIT course 18 degree.
My point is that I evaluate an argument by its logic. I don't need to know the name of a mathematician to evaluate the validity of their proof of the existence of good reduction of some Abelian Variety, say.
In particular, a number of math journals (including the American Mathematical Monthly, which is more for expository work but is still highly regarded) use *double blind* review processes (i.e. the reviewers don't see the names of the authors).
IOW I try to avoid the logical fallacy "Appeal to authority". Appeal to authority is religion, not science.

Not enough. Most people don't even opt to use Dark Wallet or any of the available coin mixers. Bitcoin's obfuscation needs to be built-in, so that the network as a whole becomes more impenetrable.

@_date: 2016-05-19 19:08:40
Also, relatively easy to use decentralized dark markets would be such a niche. OpenBazaar is a step in the right direction, but we need to take it a step further (either building on their Git repository or starting from some other well-engineered and well-tested code base)-- e.g. a greater degree of anonymity, more untraceability, better reputation systems.
Some MIT students just published a hypothetical model for such a system. It's called "Beaver" or something. Also, Dropzone claims to be a project in pursuit of these sorts of goals (I haven't looked deeply into their code so I advise checking it out yourself before deciding to donate to their project).
Long story short-- putting on airs of legitimacy in order to appease suit-and-tie wearers is actually *the fastest single way* to render Bitcoin irrelevant. We should support projects that play to Bitcoin's strengths and stop whining about legitimacy. 
Rules conform to power-- once we have our niche, WE will be the ones buying lobbyists and congressmen and rewriting the laws to make all the Bitcoin-related ecosystem fully legal.
tl;dr - Donate to projects serving Bitcoin's core constituents (dark net markets, gaming/gambling enthusiasts, off-the-books business (DACs, proof of existence, smart contracts, etc). Every donation is an investment in your future power and influence.
**P.S.** A great list of quality Bitcoin-related projects worth supporting was [posted here](
I'm personally really excited about JoinMarket. Elements looks like it will allow a lot of innovative people who don't want to mess with the Core Bitcoin client to still be able to add new features to the larger Bitcoin system. Basically, whatever your concern is, there is probably a project in this list that addresses it, and you can help bring it to center stage by donating to it.

1) Why does he assume all Bitcoin users have an issue with Coinbase?
2) What bullying? Has anyone hacked Coinbase and stolen millions of dollars from them? Has anyone stopped them from doing business? If not, then wtf is he talking about?
Business requires thick skin. ALL businesses (from Facebook to Google to Uber) get bad-mouthed on social media. That doesn't stop them from earning billions in revenue, so who freaking cares? Man up.
To point (1), there is a silent majority of satisfied Coinbase customers, but they don't post about it, they just continue doing business with Coinbase. The people who post online are self-selected to be people who happened to have negative experiences, but they are just a vocal minority.

* Multisignature accounts (at a code level) were never possible prior to Bitcoin. I.e. an account that requires 2 or more people to "enter their password" (sign the transaction) in order to spend money from it.
* etc

You only pay tax if your bitcoin increased in value.
You actually get PAID by the government if your bitcoin went down in value and then you sold/spent them. "Capital Losses", look it up.
Anyway, capital gains taxes are lower than income taxes. It's just mildly inconvenient because you have to have keep track of how much you spent every year. So what, just don't delete confirmation emails for purchases you made, in case you need to prove the amount you spent.

This is factually incorrect. In point of fact, MOST gold (thousands of tonnes, e.g.) is owned by central banks.

Finally, the vast majority of Americans don't own any significant amount (more than 0.5 troy oz, say) of the AU.

Litecoin + LightningNetwork + RSK&amp;Drivechain (smart contracts with decentralized 2-way peg (due to segwit)).
Don't get me wrong, I own a good amount of ETH as a hedge (&gt; $50K worth), but long-term I want to support a coin that has at least the following:
* Fixed cap
* Unwilling to do rollbacks to bailout specific users
* Scalability - ETH has future plans for Raiden, but LTC has Lightning up on testnet *now*. Even highest priority transactions on LTC will continue only costing a few cents. tl;dr - Litecoin has the absolute greatest scalability of any top 10 coin.
* Similar-ish codebase to BTC - so merchants can easily swap out their BTC-related code for this other coin (LTC in this case).

This is a reply to the (now deleted) comment that hypothetically floated the notion of physical violence being a way to teach humility:
Quick to throw punches? Quick to get shot. (at least in the US)
You don't like somebody, you suck it up or talk to your therapist about it.
That said, I agree that Chris DeRose and his cohost come off as a little bit self-important. They certainly know a lot about their discipline, but I'm sure someone with a different specialty could easily embarrass them. E.g. what if a mathematician came on their show and demanded that they prove the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic varieties? Or what if someone wanted to "expose" their "shallowness" and asked them to explain (in their own words) what the most significant applications of the concept of Adelic Groups has been, and to come up with (on the fly) another use for them?
It's easy for them to seem smart since they are only talking about subject matter that falls within their area of expertise. A better approach would be for them to be humble and accept that their domain is not the end-all and be-all of human knowledge. 
Meh, but it's only a symptom of wider character flaws throughout American/European culture, namely the emphasis on pride (as opposed to e.g. Japan where HUMILITY is a top-ranked virtue and pride is a character flaw).
EDIT: That said, I think the positives of their show outweigh the negatives. They DO understand what they're talkingi about, and they try to tell the truth and get the truth out of guests (even if I sometimes dislike how they set about embarrassing guests).

But serious answer:
Yea, BTC has fungibility issues. We've got some provisional stop-gap solutions (Wasabi, Joinmarket, Lightning Network), but obviously none are as elegant as the privacy solutions used by ZCash and Monero.
OTOH, there are big tradeoffs to protocol-level, zero opt-in privacy (larger cpu+disk+bandwidth+memory utilization, slightly more expensive transactions).
I believe the free-market is appropriately assigning a market value to each of these solutions (via Market Capitalization).
Bitcoin's strength isn't just its brand. It sits at a happy middle point between feature bloat and feature deficit.
