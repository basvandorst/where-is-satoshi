Go to my site, and see for yourself. 
Creation cost is the only stable aspect of bitcoin. An altimeter to let you know how high the speculation is flying. 
I love letting people know what they are risking. They make all the decisions for themselves.

Thats ok, I have been harassed many times for trying to help people see bitcoin as a true financial asset by utilizing cash flow analysis and logic. 
I don't think the word troll is as insulting as the cuss words that they are directing at me ;)

Thank you for promoting your agenda!
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:20:07
You lack discipline. You have no idea how PoW or bitcoin works. 
Thanks paid troll.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:22:17
My creation cost is standardized to $.05/kWh. Any main miner would be able to secure that price. S9's are VERY out of date btw.
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:55:50
I have backtested my model for 2 years. Yes the ATH in 2017 was many multiples. 
Personally, I wish I had my model back then. I would have sold and waited for the ratio to go back down.

I made one before at $13,800. It has aged well.

I've been trolled many times. I can sniff them out lol. 
Let's say it costs you $1 to make a chair. Would you hold your chairs in warehousing if you could sell them for $10? That is the fundamental business question you are asking. Me personally, I would not be warehousing my chairs when the price jumps exponentially.

Thank you paid troll, hope you have a good life. 
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:19:39
Using it as currency is not reckless, but holding $13,000 bitcoin is. You can't use it as a currency unless you are holding it. 
I publish financial analysis data on my site so that you can make the decision for yourself. I let people know the risk, so that they can profit and not lose so intensely.

Who needs numbers when investing? intelligent people. 
Who ignores numbers and cash flow when investing? trolls.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:58:28
The price never passed fully depreciated S9, if you were able to secure $0.05 kWh, most miners have cheaper electricity even than that. 
What will be interesting is seeing how a fully depreciated S17 will affect the creation cost.
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:07:03
That is false 12.5 bitcoin are release per block. Know your bitcoin my friend.

Timing is the most important thing in bitcoin. Creation cost is main buy support that holds the price up as it did from December to April. Cash flow affects bitcoin just like any other financial tool. It is not magic. It is a heavily manipulated commodity.

That is excellent. I have made this system so that I could have stable logic in the storm of crypto. I know you will find this information as important for understanding crypto as I do!
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:03:12
Then use it as currency, but don't expect EVERY person to see it that way. I've used bitcoin to store my wealth very effectively, but if you want to see your portfolio value increase, you must apply effective financial analysis and understanding. Using a $13,000 bitcoin as currency is pretty reckless no?
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:01:41
Cussing is using cuss words, and those words were directed at me. So yes he/she was cussing at me. 
Maybe you should reacquaint yourself with the rules of r/bitcoin. It seems that you are ignorant of them.
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:53:49
You are completely unaware of the reality of bitcoin. 
Thank you paid troll!
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:36:38
I'm not speaking in 20 year increments. Enjoy spending 13k for a bitcoin when you could spend significantly less for multiple bitcoin later. 
I like more bitcoin. Clearly you don't.
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:05:58
Creation cost analysis (Fundamental cash flow analysis) only works after the creation of ASIC's. With CPU's it was impossible to know the true creation cost. Now that people have to buy specialized equipment it allows for financial analysis to be utilized. 
This is a new and very real concept. 
My clients have access to current data and research
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:33:53
It is a question for the community. Your response is not inline with the rules of r/Bitcoin. No trolling means no trolling, not having to block 40 trolls.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:50:00
That is a personal choice you have to make in your own portfolio. Using the creation cost I know how much the miners are investing, and lets just say it isn't $18 million/day. 
This represents a paradigm shift in how to understand bitcoin. No personal opinion, but by watching what the most heavily invested people in bitcoin (the miners) are willing to do.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:55:33
Yeah man, I've been doing this for 6 years. 6 months is a pure upward market from beginning to end. You haven't tasted bear yet, it is chewy. 
Definitely check out my site man, I made it to help people understand the bitcoin market without having to learn everything I have had to. 
I wish you the best young blood ;)
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:26:16
I use creation cost data to understand when bitcoin is overvalued or high risk. I get my data here: 
There is nothing like confident trading with logical data ;)

@_date: 2019-06-28 09:34:57
You are claiming I have been telling people to buy or sell for 12 weeks. That is patently false. Why would a not troll need to spread false information? 
I have been telling people to be aware of their risk, and understand how bitcoin really works. That is hardly anything that deserves false attributes and lies placed upon it. 
Thank you troll

As in people tend to want to forget the bad things and remember the good things. Most people remember the time they won the lottery, but they forget the dozens of times they lost. It is natural for people to do this. 
Unless you are charting your results and your portfolio, you never know how you are actually doing.
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:00:42

Thank you paid troll, what data are you using to backup your view that buying bitcoin was an intelligent idea, and not gambling, any time in the past week? 
Please enlighten me with your analysis. I look forward to seeing it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:42:36
Thank you paid troll. When did I call for it 12 of the past 16 weeks? Do you have any data to support you assertion? Do you have any data to support anything at all? 
My website suggests to buy on May 2nd if you bother to read English:
Thank you for your addition PAID TROLL.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:51:55
Thank you paid troll. Please please please tell me the data saying I have been randomly calling collapses for 12 weeks. If you don't you are basically saying you randomly blather random nonsense without any data, without any understanding of anything.

Manipulation is rampant, I should have said that the efficiency upgrade will tank the floor price. I was still doing beta testing and even left my algorithm and data open during the time. I am touched you remember me though ;) Clearly I am on your mind
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:14:05
Thank you paid troll, but I am not the one name calling and cussing. That is you. Did you happen to realize that the model was using an outdated efficiency? Do you happen knowing that my clients get newly updated efficiencies? 
lol you're adorable. 
Thanks paid troll!
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:54:53
Thank you for name calling, very professional. If you actually cared about making more bitcoin you would be able to identify when bitcoin is going for wholesale and when bitcoin is going for retail. Sell into retail and buy up wholesale. 
If you cared about making bitcoin you would follow the buy low sell high view. The only way to know high's vs low's is the know the creation cost which is available here: 
Clearly you don't care about making bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:17:36
Thank you paid troll. There is literally no reason for you to comment on this. You don't like data, that is clear lol Only a paid troll follows people and continually posts on other people's posts. You get mad at me for presenting data. You are a troll.
What is your benefit otherwise? 
But thank you paid troll!

That would be stealing from my clients. If you want to see my actual research and analysis subscribe. I have given plenty away for free already: 
I hope you can understand that my clients are worth more to me than a random person on reddit asking for free analysis.

Bitcoin has to deal with normal market dynamics just like any other asset. Even if 90% of bitcoin holders "believed" it was going to go to 100k it doesn't mean that the market will respond. 
There are many hundreds of millions of dollars of shorts active on the market right now. You never invest in emotion or believe you invest with a pure profit goal, that is finance 101. 
1. Bitcoin will go up over time, but not in a week over years and halvings it will eventually go up. Following hype will lose you a lot of money. 
2. buying in a $3300 in February and selling at $12k yesterday was a pretty good time to "take profit" 
I made my site to help people save money and let them buy in at the right time and sell at the right time. Please check it out my friend. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:16:51
oh and this downturn was not surprising. I was a week off, sue me. My short will come through in the end because I use data and analysis to understand my financial positions. Unlike you my friend. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:58:16
please use real data. bitcoin is world wide, and is more popular in china and Japan than it is in the US. 
The quick movements in the market are market manipulators not regular people. People don't buy in massive blocks over short amounts of time ;) 
Easy profit is the same as profit.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:38:13
If you Dollar cost average off the creation cost you can make much more money. Knowing the creation cost makes it easier to know when it is high or low: 
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:33:24
Matter of time my friend, I'm building my case even more right now. Bitcoin operates with simple financial rules my friend. Would you invest in a stock without knowing its P/E ratio? Why would you invest in bitcoin without knowing its risk?
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:14:35
My site was made a month ago. I don't tell people how to move their money that is illegal. I just publish risk data. I can give you 12 weeks of risk, but what you are sayin has no basis in fact. Thank you troll
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:52:21
All the hail the data my friend. I'd be flying blind without it ;)
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:59:53
THANK YOU PAID TROLL. Do you have any data saying I told people to buy anything? I didn't tell anyone to do anything. I just tell people the truth about bitcoin and data. I tell people realities like how much investment is needed to maintain the price of bitcoin. 
You just like to say things because you are mad, and that is ok ;) 
Thank you paid troll.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:19:44
Right here my friend, May 2 was a good buy period after that the risk skyrocketed. I publish risk data for people to know when to buy and when to sell. Knowing risk is the cornerstone of any investment.
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:01:02
The risk is incredibly high right now here is the best source of bitcoin information:

Miners are basically the largest active parties in the bitcoin market. They held their btc in inventory Jan, Feb, March, and April, awaiting this pump and dump to sell. If they held their bitcoin for 90 days and spent 4300 for each bitcoin. They could sell all their accumulated bitcoin right now for ~$550 million of PROFIT. Everyone who is buying right now is literally paying the miners DOUBLE for their work over the past 3 months lol

Gimme Comments guys, I want to help people understand this :)
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:03:03
Miners do not need to sell all their bitcoin in order to pay their electricity bills every month, they have contracts with established budgets and lines of credit. Generally speaking miners are relatively intelligent and cutting edge. I wouldn't be so quick to assume there are inefficient mining operations and efficient mining operations. Basically every mcdonalds and Burger King are relatively the same in their efficiencies. 
Corn technically does have a limited supply amount based on arable land availability of the world. Corn isn't digital bitcoin is so they are different beasts, but the idea is efficiency upgrades affecting cost. If you don't think corn has an increasing difficulty level then you try to grow corn in your back yard and sell it for profit at market vs established farmers.
Hashrate was 2.4E in January 2017 and is 50E currently ~25x
Price was $1000 in January 2017 and is (an inflated)$7700 now ~7.7x
You should bone up on your history ;) 
If your argument was accurate we should be at a $25k btc right now.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:35:58
It is mine wholesale or buy retail. This is site publishes the wholesale price of bitcoin (the price the miners pay for one): 
The retail price is in HIGH speculation right now, and it is not advisable to buy. The drop is incoming.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:10:13
Mining activity SUPPORTS price. Speculation drives price up and down. Miners Prepurchase their BTC for established prices which is the fundamental floor price (floor demand) for btc
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:50:00
If everyone is using the same efficiency mining equipment. Try making a $7800 bitcoin with you CPU right now. You will spend tens of thousands on your electricity bill before you even come close to a block :$
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:13:53
If I pay 2$ for something that morons are buying for $100 I will sell to as many morons for $100 as I can, then $90 morons, then $80 morons, etc etc all the way down to $2.2 smart people.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:14:30
You put a lot of faith in traders ability to not panic with large thousand sized continual dumpings. Trading volume is EXCEPTIONALLY inflated check out this SEC submittal explaining the false volume counts in bitcoin: 
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:39:36
The supply does not change given more efficient miners yes, but the cost of acquisition changes based on more efficient miners. Not only do new miners get a bigger piece of the pie, but they get the bigger piece for a lower per unit cost. If I had a magic ASIC that could pump out 100exahashes for $1/day, I could sell 70% of all new bitcoin/day for $2 and make quite good profit, while I TANK the price over a short amount of time.
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:48:21
Actually no, Miners can dump bitcoin for $4300. If you are using a relatively new S15 from Bitmain. This is the only site that publishes this data: 
The miners are the most educated and aware people operating in bitcoin. They have been in it for years, and they dictate how the supply is disbursed. They are the whales. What other group receives 1800 Bitcoin/day?
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:14:57
High efficiency ASICs will make low efficiency ASICs obsolete also. Try using a tractor from the 1890's vs a 2019 tractor lol
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:17:18
Who is we? look at the prices bitcoin miners are paying for coin here: 
Hash rate has increased 25x in 2 years while price has only increased 7x. More hash rate doesn't mean higher price.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:12:22
I don't think you understand how selling cheap goods affects market prices. You would clear all the high profit orders (morons buying at $7700) with all your budgeting and profit expectations  You could quickly destroy an order book doing that. See how much miners pay for their coins here: 
This is the only site publishing this data.
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:45:11
Yes, but we live in a momentum world with bitcoin. If I begin dumping 1800 coins a day for $100 on ANY exchange it will eat away the price like a caterpillar eating a leaf.
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:46:13
I have made a post explaining how the efficiency upgrade will tank the price of bitcoin. Please check it out and educate yourself on the mechanics of the bitcoin market:

ASIC's increase in efficiency every year. The new price for 56Thashes of computing power is $1898 (S17). Back in 2016 the price for 13Thashes of computing power was $2000(S9). Anyone using oxen to plow their fields cannot compete with someone using a John Deer tractor.
