Excuse me, are you saying that if I have a wallet in Coinbase and my friend has a wallet in GDAX, can I send BTCs to him totally for free? (sorry I'm trying to understand some things yet)

If the woman is the minority in the crypto world, it is because they are not interested or because the news is not coming to them, which means that we are not doing a good job in the issue of "expanding and showing everyone about the crypto world" agrees ?
BTW welcome to Bitcoin community and i hope you are doing very well in BTC ecosystem!!

Thanks for noticing my username, but it really is just a kind of sarcasm, because everyone knows that the best time to buy the BTC was in 2009 and the second best time is today :)

PS: If you are buying many BTCs, the most recommended is to buy a Hardware wallet (trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com). If you do not have money, you can use mycelium, just make sure it has a multi signature system, this will help a lot in the security of your BTCs.

Very nice!!! I think all Exchanges should do this, I was not paying much attention to this at first because BCH was a new altcoin, but the moment an altcoin is explicitly trying to steal the place of another currency meaning that she is the real one and not the primary one and begins to create a giant mess in the head of people without information, the right thing is to change her name.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:43:04
I'm really happy for you, you said you bought it in 2013 and got hold of it, right? this must have been a real nightmare, without knowing what could happen, it must have been days, months, years very difficult, congratulations, now you are free and still have some stock in your domain, Bitcoin and his magic to help people to transform their lives into something better !!!

As far as I'm concerned with the Bitcoin world, paper wallets are the second safest way to stock your BTCs, the first would be the hardware wallets, what's so unsafe about paper wallets? I understand that they can be a little complex to understand how they work and totally fragile, since it's paper. But if you have some care of it, you have no problem. Am i wrong? :/
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:54:22
I follow the CoinMarketCap to see the prices of the crypto coins since 1 month ago I think, and only realize 1 week ago that they use bitcoin (dot) com like reference to the BTC called website 2, they should not change it? I do not know much about this, but a lot of people say that bitcoin (dot) com is a scam site.

The Bitcoin is SOO fast!!! and honestly i don't see it in 13k, 14k and 15k LoL yesterday when i see, it was 12k and something, and today i come here and it is 16k and my face now is " WTF? "

Really several bad things by the way, but you know everything has its good and bad sides, unfortunately there is no way to have something 100% perfect. My friend always complains about the work, she said that any time it will end up becoming a robot of so much that she works, something really complicated.
I think small cities are always better, not only in Japan, but all over the world, they are humbler places where work is not in the first place in people's lives, maybe because of that they are peaceful places.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:07:08
I do not quite understand, are you saying that your boss is paying you with BTC? but if your payment is today and the BTC is $ 5,000.00 for example, and on your next payment it is $ 15,000.00, would it pay you 3 BTCs or just 1 BTC? or does it pay you a fixed amount of BTCs regardless of the price of the BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:00:21
Oh sorry, I did not know about this, I'm new to reddit (maybe this sounds weird to many), thanks for showing me the subreddit, many are saying $ 20k in January, I just wanted to know more or less how much I could profit by putting $ 100 per month from now through December 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:29:32
You made an excellent decision buying BTCs in those 3 years, you must be very happy with this decision, you must be feeling a champion now and being very proud of your choice, at least that would be my feeling for myself. Gratz and I hope your money keeps growing!!!

Honestly i don't know what to said to that guy, but $1 is really no sense, like is easy send BTC, if I was sure he would " HODL " the BTC and sell it only when it had a good return, i could send at least 0,002 BTC to him to try help him but...
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:56
I understand, thank you for responding :) I think on site lbc is something like this, the information is kind of confusing, but from what I understand is that if you send BTCs from your wallet at lbc and the other user's wallet is also from site lbc the rate is free. Apparently you pay a fee just the moment you buy the BTC from a seller there inside the site. I think that's what they say about the internal system.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:48:22
Exactly, after that when your BTCs are in your wallet, your BTCs will be invested but remember depending on your wallet (desktop wallet, mobile wallets), they may not be 100% secure, so if you're investing something big, it's always recommended that you buy a Hardware wallet (trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com), you can also make a paper wallet, so your BTCs will be safe and out of sight from malicious attacks from the cyber world (hackers, viruses, malware).
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:30:39
I understand, as we know everything has pros and cons, so in doubt the most certain would be to use paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:16:41
With the situation as it is now in the BTC, and if we think in a speculative way where the BTC is going to appreciate from now on at least $ 3,000 per month, if I put $ 100 every month, how much $$$ would I get in 1 year? for example today until December 2018?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:15:29
You talking about Satoshi, I was wandering on Instagram two days ago and I found a man named Satoshi Nakamoto, I'm really afraid something might happen to him, imagine if some crazy guy thinks he's really Satoshi Nakamoto and kills him, he's a model and live in Japan LoL

Interesting, a question please. So if I use Electrum + multi signature, my BTCs are at least 90% safe? if so, then Electrum is fantastic, because it is free and highly safe.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:28:21
I thought of something like that, you give me .1 BTC today ($1000 for example), so in 2 years maybe your .1 today will be worth .01 ($1000 for example) so I'll give it back to you .02 ($2000 for example) from your total .1 BTC today, in the end, you will get double the money you loaned me today and I get .08 both win!

I see, I did not actually invest when I first met the BTC because my family is not the type of investor family, and so I simply let it pass, a fatal mistake, as an economics student, you must have thought of many things when saw the BTC and its eco system hehe. I also have doubts and questions and thoughts about the BTC, for example I do not believe it reaches $ 100,000 until December 2018 but at the same time making calculations I believe it can arrive. The world of BTC is something really incredible, and every day we look at it it gives us some surprise. Is not just about money, money, money, the tech behind the name BTC is really some magical!!

Welcome to BTC :)
1º don't look the BTC price all the time, it is totally a roller coaster and that will drive you to the crazy hehe
2º always make a tour here in r/Bitcoin always have good posts and good comments to help us.
3º don't sell your BTC in a panic moment, if you to do that you will lost all your money.
4º HODL no one knows what the true potential of the BTC is, it can value much more in the coming years.

Bitcoin Cash was created due to a fork against the BTC, it is kind a " clone " of the BTC, also BTC was created in 2008 and released publicly in 2009, I 
 think this is enough to tell who the scam of this story is. :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:48:35
No doubt if you are using the BTC ecosystem just to test, if you are going to buy a lot of BTC at once in the Exchanges or if you do not have the money to buy a Hard wallet (Trezor $ 100?) (Ledger 60 euros i think), the safest exit would be a paper wallet, the problem with paper wallet is that every time you want to take BTC from it and send it to another wallet you will need to send the entire balance to another wallet and create a new paper wallet to deposit your next BTC. (security issues)
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:26:13
The best moment to invest in BTC is today!!!

Hello :) from what I understand, you're comfortable if you get to lose the 80 euros, right? if so, then okay, you can buy and leave in Coinbase, but keep in mind that when you buy Bitcoin in an Exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp or any other), Bitcoins are not yours for real, they become yours the moment you take it out of Exchange and put it in a wallet (hardware wallet, desktop Wallet, mobile wallet, paper Wallet).

Okay but look, don't make difference, if you said 0.6 BTC ( you are using Satoshis like 2nd "currency" about the BTC ) and if you said 0.6 Satoshis ( you are using Satoshis like 1st "currency" about the BTC that is 1.0) i think that we have only differents point views, but both are corrects. As i said 0.6 is simply 60.000.000 Satoshis.

Hey!! yeah, i think you are correct, I'm the kind of person who likes to explain things perfectly, and sometimes it's really disruptive instead of helping xD which was the case, in my head I thought talking about $ 8.000,00 would make her into the " game ", but that made her move away quickly hehe and I also thought that talking about Satoshi would give her more information and so it would make her even more confused, in the end she will not invest in the BTC anyway :(

Depending on where you live, you can simply sign up for Coinbase and buy your BTCs there, after that it is good that you send those BTCs to another wallet where you have full control of your BTCs if you are thinking of being an investor and concentrating large amounts on the wallet, it is recommended to buy a Hardware wallet trezor.io, ledgerwallet.com. If not, you can use a free wallet, mycelium (android), bread wallet (iOS), still have the choice to have a free wallet on your computer called desktop wallet, electrum.

I saw something like that two days ago at bitcointalk forum, the guy was asking for some tips to invest in BTC, he said " I have $1 please help me " everyone laughed at his face, I found the laughs a bit unnecessary, but anyway he asked for it...
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:40:21
I am having this doubt also about buying in Coinbase or GDAX, in Coinbase you pay 1.5% in rate, already in GDAX the rate can be well under 0.25% or even for free if you use the order system limit, so why have people who continue to use Coinbase to buy.
I hope someone really answers your question, so the person will be helping me and you and without doubt a lot of other users.

LoLoL TRUE!
I went to tell my friend yesterday about BTC and for her to invest in BTC, I told her from January of that year until now it already valued at least 800%, she was all happy, but when said that it was worth $ 8,000.00 she just said " OMG!!! how do you buy it? I'm poor, I do not want to know that!!! " I tried to explain that we can buy it in Satoshi and everything, but then she just ignored it and randomly changed the conversation....
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:09:02
Hello :) from what I know Electrum is safe, but it has the issue of your computer being online, if you are with your computer most of the time online and have Electrum installed on it this could have a risk of some hacker having access to your system and hack your PRIVATE KEYS, but for this to happen your computer probably has viruses or something, so I think if your computer is totally free of viruses and malwares, it works safely. Anyway a good way out is to make paper wallets (but this is a bit annoying) or else buy the famous hardware wallets trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:45:08
For sure if you are going to use all that money the best way out is you buy a Hardware wallet before. $ 150,000 is a lot for me at least, after buying the Hardware wallet, use the Coinbase if you want, and pick up at the same time and send the BTC to your hardwallet.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:09:33

I wanted to said some about cents and dollars to use it as example, but for example, when you said $0,20, how do you said it? 0,20 cents or 0,20 dollar? here is my country we said 20 cents.

You need only create an account in other exchange and to do an altcoin address on it :) after you send from Poloniex to your new altcoin address :D remember send an altcoin from Poloniex to the same altcoin address in your other Exchange account. ( for example: BTC in Poloniex to your BTC address in your other exchange) :)) and don't forget about transaction fees... To BTC minimum withdraw fee is 0,0002 i think.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:12:07
I think you could have bought for example a Hardware wallet Trezor (90,00 euros) or a Ledger and then with the other 100 euros you could have bought the BTCs in Coinbase, so you would get out of Coinbase the BTC and send in your Hardware wallet and forget it there, who knows in 5 years your 100 euros could be worth 100.000 euros, you can do this with a Desktop wallet or a mobile wallet but do not know if it would be very prudent to leave so much time in a Desktop or Mobile wallet
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:22:32
Hello, this is not true, what happens is that there was a hard fork against the BTC and with that was created the altcoin Bitcoin Cash, so when this happens you get for free the same amount you have of the currency that suffered the hard fork, for example if on the hard fork date you have 20 BTCs in your wallet (not 20 BTC on any Exchange) you would win after the hard fork 20 Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:42:30
Actually i think that both is correct, because you said 1 BTC only when 1 is before from comma, for example 1,0. If i told 0,6 BTC would be 60.000.000 Satoshis, then to me both 0.6 BTC or 0.6 Satoshis is correct, right? :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:45:26
Coinbase is an Exchange, and it can suffer attacks and the accounts can be hackeds, compromised, among other things. If you are using little money in an Exchange, it's okay. But anyway it is recommended that you have a wallet where you own your own PRIVATE KEYS, the wallets are free, and if you are investing heavily and buying a lot of BTCs then it is highly recommended that you buy a wallet trezor.io (TREZOR WALLET), ledgerwallet.com (LEDGER NANO S)
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:28:49
I'm not totally sure, but I think it can be any wallet that you have your own PRIVATE KEYS, because the reward system is somewhat " natural ", I guess. Just remember, never leave the currency on some Exchange, they will probably never reward you.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:44:23
Just remember that Kraken, Bittrex, Coinbase, they are exchanges and not wallets :)
Exchanges are make to you buy/sell altcoins, when you create an account in some Exchange you have a wallet, but it is not technically yours, why you do not appropriate the PRIVATE KEYS.
Real Wallets are like Trezor and Ledger Nano S but they are not for free, you can too use Electrum that is a Desktop and free Wallet, but it is not so secure :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:08:49
I learn that in Japanese alphabet don't have " letters alone " for example the " n " in Bitcoin, would not be it n = so? then Bittokoiso?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:55:07
I see, cool! well, desktop wallet ( Electrum ) is free but have risk, because if your computer have some virus/malware, some hacker can steal your PRIVATE KEYS and so bye bye BTCs :( you can use the site bitaddress.org about paper wallet, the site have the step by step and is really easy. Just have in mind, your BTCs will to be stocked in a paper, then it is totally fragile.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:46:30
Hello :D if you don't want risk all your money, you can buy some Satoshi only. 1 BTC is $9.000,00 now, all your money would be now 0.6 Satoshis, but you don't need use all your money, you can buy for example to test $100,00.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:58:30
I met BTC in 2013, and at the time I was very dumb to search for things I did not understand, so I looked artificially at the BTC and gave up, this year fate ironically put the BTC back on my way, my brother sent me an email saying "let's make some money online?" and I said "how?" and he showed me links, videos about the BTC haha
Good luck man! and don't forget, HODL!!!

The price has changed so fast from $ 10.000 to $ 11.000 that everyone was caught off guard I guess hehe I think it's time to start making $ 20.000 memes already, so we will not have that kind of problem again!!!
