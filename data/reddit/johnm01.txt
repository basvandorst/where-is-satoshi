its one thing knowing what to expect but who has the funds to take on wallstreet.... 
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:06:16
hope you're right :) 
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:43:03
so is this the future for bitcoin?.every month or so they short the shit out of it... sorry if its a stupid question but ive no idea how futures markets work.... 
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:14:10
thats why i tell nobody about bitcoin.... not worth the hassle... 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:44:05
I guess if some future law came in that they had to give up customer details then they would know you had bitcoin and didn't declare it...

Fair enough, don't go buying a lambo if you work in McDonald's though
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:22:45
Ok you've probably a lot more than I have, I'm small time..  but I don't think you're gonna scrutinized like manafort... People mention Al Capone... Tax evasion was used to nail him... but these guys were already on the authorities radar for other reasons and tax evasion was what was used to bring them down.... They don't have the resources to analyze every Joe's accounts unless unless they think it's a significant chunk

ive used belgacoin with no issues a few times
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:50:42
I dunno, bit paranoid I guess..  but it does look like a way to spend some of the profits I have... If there was a completely anonymous way of doing it it would be great
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:20:45
Easily track cash spending... Sorry mate but I don't think you're that important they would follow you about
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:23:42
What evidence have you got about them going after sellers on local bitcoins... Highly doubt it..
I'm not advising anyone to avoid tax ... Just wondering how they can realistically track where a bitcoin ended up or what it was used for... I'm not resident in the us 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:26:44
I'm in Ireland, it's a measly 1250 tax free , then 33percent ... Absolute robbers
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:08:21
Spend it man..  :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:33:40
I'd be wary them having my details... Once the government come knocking it's all there for them
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:10:26
What can they do really if there's no evidence of profit....ie I sell them on local bitcoins for cash... I could just claim they were lost 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:16:54
Very true
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:58:21
Excellent store of value
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:27:27
So it's an anonymous card?

How do you see his total donations?...

Dunno about last few years but Richard heart has 20k target by Christmas predicted when it was 5 or 6 k a couple months back... 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:39:35
Salty indeed
@_date: 2018-08-20 12:06:05
Great interview.... a great spokeswoman for bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-08-03 10:05:32
it dumped dumped dumped, 
now the wifes got the hump hump hump,
if it drops more,
she'll open the door, 
and kick my butt out onto the dirty street floor!
@_date: 2018-08-22 09:40:24
i lol'd
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:39:03
thanks.... so when i turn on the passphrase feature i get a brand new wallet (0 balance) right?.... i then need to transfer the bitcoin over to this new wallet from old (no passphrase) wallet....
sorry if its an obvious question...still new to it
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:45:15
thank you! appreciate it
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:31:53
sorry to butt in but i never passphrased my trezor.... what can i do now to rectify this?
would it be a case of creating a new passphrase version, writing down the new address and then going to other wallet and transferring?
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:13:50
really good, i enjoyed it
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:44:57
what other tech are you using on the site?
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:13:34
so you held them all this time?
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:56:01

@_date: 2017-11-17 17:23:39
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:55:08
This is the US right?
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:59:39
if i become a millionaire im on the first flight :) 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:46:52
Thanks dude
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:40:53
yeah but why would he try and bring the price even lower.... it doesnt makse sense as a holder of a large quantity.... he wasnt buying it back.
The article makes it sound like, he recouped all the fiat he needed and decided to try and destroy the market altogether... no reason behind it though
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:05:39
can anyone explain the part where it says he tried to crash the market at 6k?.... i dont get the reasoning behind this?
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:59:22
lol, just a piss take of thread on front page
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:53:24
Thank you... I wonder does he realize he's a crypto celeb ;)
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:56:00
this is genius
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:34:31
what about the school of thought that people are buying to get the free bgold/2x and will sell off after it...  hard to know
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:39:13
Who is this dude
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:26:18
can i get a free one too :) 
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:33:36
Yeah but he wasn't buying back
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:35:44
is there anyway to find out how many bitcoin were bought for this pump?
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:09:50
what happens post fork though? ... reckon itll drop?
@_date: 2018-07-13 10:17:56
noob question.... what does it mean when a lightning channel has a certain number of btc?... no idea how lightning works
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:46:09
@_date: 2018-07-17 14:12:31
whats the max sale allowed?
@_date: 2018-07-04 08:30:45
so do you think Mcafee will be following up on his bet :) 
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:03:34
dammit :) ... i like the mugs... although im in europe so what are the chances it will make it to me in one piece
@_date: 2018-07-13 10:24:32
so he has sent 35 btc through the lightning network? or he has spent 35 opening channels?... 
@_date: 2018-07-13 10:32:06
thanks for explanation.... one last one :) .... do these channels last for a certain time period or are they permanent?
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:08:12
nice one dude, but do you plan on staying alone there forever?.... 
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:53:13
So no romantic intentions? Kids etc? ... I like my own company too but everyone needs human contact sometimes
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:07:37
a noob...question... what happens if the trezor wallet breaks down or is lost?.... can i buy a new one and regenerate?
