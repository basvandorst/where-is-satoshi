And the list goes on and on.
The numbers vary. But they all agree on one thing. Over 60% (lowest number) of prostitutes have been sexually abused as children.

Well, tbf I never said that all prostitution is supporting child abuse.
What I did say is that, one should realize that one of the main reasons the woman is performing a sexual act with you for money, is because she most probably was sexually abused as a kid. Of course not in all case, but surely in a lot of the cases.
Are high escort different than the drug addicted street hooker. Of course. But a very low regards to the intimacy of sex usually comes from a very open view on sex in the early stages of life. Be that from abuse, or a very liberal way of looking at things.

Why the wow?
70-80% of all prostitutes have been sexually abused as kids.
Now, you may close your eyes to that fact. Or you may think that those numbers aren't the reason they do prostitution.
But the facts are there.
I am not saying you like kids, by liking prostitutes.
But how one can be with a prostitute and not being disgusted by that fact is beyond me. 
(And I am a freedom loving person, who actually believes you should be able to do with your own body as you please).

That was just what I could find in the 2 minutes googleing. In depth data will probably show you a similar number.
And of course, US. vs. Europe will probably give you another set of numbers.
All though agree that if it's not sexual abuse as kids, then it's different types of abuse.
Being that drug abuse, economical hell holes they've been in etc.
I know about the Danish hookers, and the more "liberal" way of thinking.
I am from Denmark myself, and we have had the debate about the "happy hooker" for many years.
And I did not say all have had a bad childhood, since there is curiosity and stuff like that. BUT, most figures point towards a shitty childhood being that sexual abuse, or other types of abuse.

Well, everything is wrong with liking prostitutes.
When you realize that most prostitutes were sexually abused as kids, and they are only doing what they were taught as kids...
Then one would really think twice about liking prostitutes.
