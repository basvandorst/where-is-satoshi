HK is a popular place for offshore companies. So, you found the address of their (former?) registered agent. It has nothing to do with shade.  This is a common business practice.
I don't know what you were expecting dropping by an office without an appointment. If you dropped by my business unannounced, I'd tell you to go away.

Yikes dude. Think twice about putting your house on the line.

Is that before or after you factor in the cost of electricity?

Ehhh, lots of people are saying this seriously. I doubt everyone is being sarcastic.

Go visit China. It's easy to pay for stuff using wechat/weixin. Scan a QR code, approve the transaction, and you're done. How you describe using btc will be how easy it will be to use any currency in the very near future.

Honestly, why not let the noobs gamble.
I've invested in previous bubbles and made some money. Like you, I see the influx of "dumb money". It's fine, let people learn their lesson. Some will win, many will lose. That's how it goes.

You mean all these people who could see all their wealth could be wiped out by some unforeseen future event? Well, it will be a glorious short sell opportunity.

I love all the bad, naive investment advice I see on here.

Gold will never go to 0, for one thing.

It beats locking in your losses at $1k.  Assuming you have any money left after foolishly buying on margin.

It's only robbing you if you are stupid enough to put your money under your mattress.

Seriously. All this holding forever stuff is for the naive. If you're massively up, you should consider cashing out. And then once enough people realize they should cash out, we're going to see a big price drop.

Something people forget is that you pay a fee to store that gold that you speculate on.

Investing in Bitcoin is nothing like investing in a stock. At this point, it is more like speculating on land during a housing bubble.

They do buy stock.

Well, sweet, thanks for totally missing my point.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:33:46
Yikes, dude.

Do you have a price target in mind? If you have reached it, consider selling.  
Also, you can hedge your bets a little by only selling part of your holdings. It doesn't have to be all or nothing.
I'd be very wary of holding much longer.  I think at this point suckers are propping up the price, plenty of FOMO out there. Also, beware of the people that say Bitcoin is backed by energy expenditure or something.  That said, I could be wrong and the bubble might not pop for a while longer.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:32:13
Nice. This is smart.

It's a conspiracy to keep the price of bitcoin jacked up. If people started selling off their holdings en masse, the price would crater.
