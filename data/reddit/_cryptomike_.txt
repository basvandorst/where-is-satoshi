It means Bitcoin is the best way to store value and will probably remain that way.

Sorry. I meant to say financial accountable. Like when a small business owner signs a lease and they have to personally guarantee it.

Days? Ha. In this market I'd say in the next 10 mins.

That's the most unbiased prediction I've ever heard...

It will definitely rise and it will definitely drop. The question is how long can you keep your emotions in check.

I salute what you are doing! 
But that's like saying we should hold all politicians accountable for the bills they pass. 
It'll never happen. It's not about reporting just the news anymore, it's about attracting readers. And controversial / fake news is damn good at that.

The 4 sec clip that led to a 6% drop in Tesla's value. 
That's more than $600 million per sec lost.

It's a cool tool to find and compare crypto exchanges by country, payment method and coins.
Looks like there's a bunch of options for NZ/AU.
I think you can buy btc on coinbase in Australia, but you can't sell it. That's the most secure option.

No one takes this into account when considering Bitcoin's market cap. Seems like it would be a positive over the long term. Less coins = less supply = higher price. Right??
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:51:55
How many times is bitcoin supposed to half? Is it based on time or amount of blocks mined?

A paper wallet is the easiest and cheapest way. If you have a safety deposit box, keep a copy there. As long as your kids have the wallet address and private key, they'll have no problem accessing it. They could wait 50 years and still access it. And in 10 years, Bitcoin will have replaced fiat currency, so they won't even have to cash it in! They can buy a car or house with it.

Sorry. Sleeping right now. This must be a dream.

A plausible scenario
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:12:58
That's a great way of putting it. Market cap is the outstanding value of a company's shares, not coins. Combine that with the fact that its almost impossible to accurately determine the circulating supply of many coins. Kind of scary that the entire market is driven by that kind of "fuzzy" math.

I know chart analysis is complete bullshit in crypto...but I do take comfort in it.

You're right. There's no way anyone can predict the actual date. If you look at the date of publication ([ it looks like Aug 10 is the final day to submit comments. But the commission has up to 90 days to make a decision. There's no way to know when that might be.

And when it went down 20&amp; in June, people forget it was still up 270&amp; from the same month last year. We could do this all day.
