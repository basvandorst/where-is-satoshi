Why can't he show a cryptographic proof? Make a transaction or sign using the coins known to be mined by Satoshi?

Computing power / energy spent on validating blocks is very very very very negligible compared to the same spent on mining( solving the hash puzzle). Even a cheapest mobile phone could validate a 1GB block. The only problem is the risk of orphaning due to network issues.

Is it priced lower or higher?

1. Inheritance of coins by someone else in future
2. Implement micro payments
: Consider two participants Customer(C) and Provider(P). Customer has to pay for a service whose maximum value is $100 for one month. Time at beginning of transaction is T. Problem: Normally if every small transaction has to be in the block chain, unnecessary increase in blockchain and transaction fee penalty has to paid which may be proportionally higher considering the transaction itself is small. Instead a below scheme will require publishing only two transactions to the blockchain.
  1. Initial Deposit: Generate the following transaction signed by C and put in blockchain 
      * Input is $100 from C
      * Output can be redeemed by the following script
             if CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY(T+31days):
                pubKey(C) can redeem
             else:
                both pubKey(C) and pubKey(P) together can redeem
  2. When C uses a micro service. E.g. makes a phone call. Lets say C uses $1 worth of service on day 2. C generates the below transaction and sends to P.
      * Input is the initial deposit transaction
      * Outputs:
          1. $1 for pubKey(P)
          2. $99 can be redeemed by following script
                 if CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY(T+30days):
                     pubKey(C) can redeem
                 else:
                     both pubKey(C) and pubKey(P) together can redeem
      * Note this transaction need not be put into block chain immediately. It can be put anytime before T+30. This is generated by C signed and sent to P. P should sign it for it to become valid.
   3. When C users another $2 worth of service on day 3, and the previous transaction was not published by P, C sends another transaction:
      * Input is the initial deposit transaction
. 
      * Outputs:
          1. $3 for pubKey(P)
          2. $97 can be redeemed by following script
                 if CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY(T+29days):
                     pubKey(C) can redeem
                 else:
                     both pubKey(C) and pubKey(P) together can redeem
      * Note the input is again the initial deposit transaction and the transaction need not be published to blockchain immediately. P may choose to publish it once in ten days. The previous unpublished transaction is no longer required and should not be published. 
   4. If P happens to publish the previous transaction, C should use that as input next time he needs to pay. C is guaranteed any unspent money he will get back after one month. P is guaranteed that C cannot double spend the deposit before one month, so he doesn't have to publish each and every small payments. He can publish on the last day the last transaction and get his fee. Only compromise is if the P is bad, C gets his money locked up for one month.

Can someone confirm the main blockchain is free from invalid blocks and the invalid blocks are orphaned?

Back to 284!

Another main difference is that in other pools, pool operator decides what transactions to include in the next block, in p2pool, each user can choose for themselves. They just have to make sure the coinbase (newly mined coins + transaction fees) is allocated according to p2pool rules (i.e to those contributed to share chain). Not sure how this happens in practice. Someone who has mined can confirm.

How can one chip mine bitcoins? Is it linked to a mining pool? Which mining pool? What are the terms?

I assume it is because the private key got leaked somehow. Is that correct or is there other way to steal?
