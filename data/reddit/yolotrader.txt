When SPY goes down, SDS goes up.  Seems convenient you left that out...

Honestly, as bad as I feel for the investors, I hope this story turns out to be interesting.  I'm probably a bad person.

I'd like to point out that we don't know for sure that theft happened here.
It's entirely possible the dude just lost all of his clients' money in the markets and spent years trying to figure out what to do about it.  
It's also possible he cleverly laundered the money and is living on a private island somewhere.
Until the investigation completes we won't know which of the two it is.  Fraud either way, but perhaps not a Ponzi Scheme.

I think the USD *should* die, and may even come close to dying.  But the whole scam the US is running is pretty clever.  First, they made sure that oil is traded in dollars.  Then they pushed the dollar into every corner of the world, making it ubiquitous.  
Every now and then somebody wants to start trading oil in something other than dollars, and the US sends in troops, installs another form of government in that region, and reinstates the trading of oil in dollars.  So as long as the US remains able to strong-arm other nations, I don't see the dollar going away any time soon.  It may crash, inflate, and otherwise change in value, but going away altogether requires the US to get militarily weak first.
Basically, the US' policy is "we know the dollar is going downhill.  But we have weapons, and we'll make sure that when things get bad, everyone else suffers for our sins instead."  And as much dirty and underhanded as that is, it does seem to stand up as a financial strategy.

Unless war breaks out, and the Chinese activate their backdoors in our routers and chipsets.  That would wreak havoc with the internet for years.  
But maybe the world would reset back to the 8-bit era.  That'd be cool for a while.

It's the market.  You can't count on anything.  You can just increase odds in your favor and hedge risks.  Stop losses help you hedge against risks.
I'd say if you *don't* use stop orders, stop trading now.

O.. Ok?

I'm no expert, but I think you're a troll.

Nope.  Gotta get pro

Part of me hopes they can.  After all, I just got my US citizenship... would hate to have to move somewhere else once the fit hits the shan.

That's not true.  Some bacteria develop resistance to them, but new antibiotics get created in response, and, if properly rotated, the bacteria lose their antibiotic resistance over time.

There's two things that we don't know about for sure here:
* Was he living a lavish lifestyle?  The article only said that he used expensive golf trips *to entice new investors*.  Beyond that he lived in a penthouse, and it says nothings else.  For a man who had access to millions of dollars, that's not entirely lavish.  Much more likely that he just lost most of the money.
* He accepted new clients, probably as a way to pretend that everything was still going well.  As the article said, *nobody* got paid back out.  A Ponzi scheme would continue to pay out the previous set of investors as they start to get nervous.  This guy refused to pay anybody ever (which also makes his investors idiots for not realizing something was wrong).  This points to something akin to a gambling addiction.  The guy kept taking more client money, and just kept losing it over and over.
It *seems* like he just lost all the money, at least to me.

Trader here.  I wouldn't go that route.  If you think another collapse is looming (and many people do), and if you don't think that the entire US dollar will die (extremely unlikely, but if it does, not getting shot will be a bigger priority than how much money you have), then keep your money in USD.  USD is historically a lot less risky than BTC.  
The dollar doesn't fluctutate for unpredictable reasons, and it's fairly pervasive outside of the US.  If the NYSE crashes, that means that stocks and bonds will depreciate with respect to the dollar, making the dollar the thing to have on hand.

Not even in your home.  If you really want your money to persist, hide that stuff.  If *the world collapses*, people with guns will be coming around to take your gold from you.  What you'll want to do is bury it like a pirate.  
I doubt a collapse that major is happening though.  And if it is, money is the last thing you'll want to care about.  If it gets so bad that the dollar becomes paper or otherwise becomes non-currency, then food, ammunition, and antibiotics will be the only thing you'll be worrying about.  Things will get really, *really* bad.
Heck, even during the Great Depression, the dollar was still the dollar.
