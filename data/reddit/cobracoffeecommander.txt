Telling people to research crypto themselves is lazy advice. You're setting them up to "research" things in a market that is already inflated with bad advice

Is there a pullback in the amount of volume that is actually spent towards items or services not on exchange? I would think that the speculative value of bitcoin is so high that buyers are less likely to buy shit w their bitcoins at current levels

Investing noob question here. Seems like my couple years of investing in stocks there were no psychological attachments to whole numbers in prices. Huge buy and sell walls at clean numbers like 4750, 5000, etc. while the stock market doesnt have those resistances in such a clean way. Is that just due to all the automated trading on the stock market or is the nature of crypto just so speculative the price is kind of arbitrary?
