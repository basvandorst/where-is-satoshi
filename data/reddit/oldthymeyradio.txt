Yup. Just like gold and your mom.

I think it’s thematically relevant to the sub (Turing/cryptography + banknotes/Bitcoin), but it’s far from a given that Turing would be pro-crypto.

What’s with the Winkle propaganda lately? Are these guys trying to buy social media?
If so, I am only in favor of this if:
A) It’s in support of an eventual presidential bid, and 
B) They have to fight to the death to decide which one gets the Oval Office.

Doesn’t get any more establishment than a place called “gold man-sacks”.

It’s always so easy to post this, and since it’s rarely possible to prove otherwise (OP rarely has a video waiting to prove the encounter just in case), you can’t be meaningfully called out.

TA is not a crystal ball. 
It is also not a bathroom mirror. Or a wombat. 
Other things TA is not: A banana. Five left shoes. That feeling you get when you lean back too far in a chair and then catch yourself. 
Hope that helps.

More importantly rape and murder.

What is the source for this? How were the questions phrased, specifically, as well as the answers? Who the hell answers any question they don't have to, about buying bitcoin?
This is important! If it holds up.

I can find you a guy with $106,422.

Upvoted. This is an important post. The psychology behind how people do or don’t value something should be seen as very important in driving adoption.

While we’re at it, the amount of gold landing on the earth in meteorites is progressing pretty slowly compared to how fast turtles exhale carbon monoxide.
So I guess gold is fucked, too.

The idea of $1T “flowing into the market” overnight is silly, but getting to a multi trillion market cap only takes a tiny fraction of that amount to flow in in a short FOMO frenzy. It’s not that a multi trillion market cap is implausible. It’s that market cap itself is kind of a ridiculous metric in the first place.
Your military budget example is the perfect thing to compare it to, in fact. Because in that case, you’re talking about an actual sum of real life money changing hands to fund a material endeavor. But a cryptocurrency market cap is nothing like that, because as soon as the market starts trying to cash in that $5 trillion, the vast majority of it vaporizes as the price crashes. Looking at things in market cap terms paints a nice, dramatic picture. But it tells you almost nothing about what this pile of assets is actually “worth”.

I think the generational point is very important. If there's one thing you can count on "new blood" to do, it's not share their parents' timidity about embracing things that seem disruptive or nontraditional compared to what came before. It's not necessarily that "newer is automatically better", but this kneejerk debate about which has more "instrinsic value" — fiat or crypto — isn't going to seem worth having to them. It's just going to be a simple question of "What can I do with it?"
*Especially* if they perceive the old shit to be broken. Which is exactly how younger people already feel about the financial institutions and economic picture they are inheriting. (Which is to say, being largely left out of.)
In hindsight, I think Bitcoin's timing will be seen as having been just about perfect. Decentralized assets don't actually require popular psychological buy-in to absorb a large chunk of the global economy, because their utility as stores of value doesn't hinge solely on people's willingness to buy sandwiches and coffee with it.
But it just so happens that now is the perfect time for exactly that to happen on top of everything else.
