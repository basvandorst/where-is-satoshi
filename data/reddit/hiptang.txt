Someone replied it is a joke. I saw it on the news and I guess I didn't hear the its bullshit part. I edited my original post ASAP to indicate this. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:38:54
Really? Oops... I was half watching the TV tonight and it came up on the news. What do you mean by fake?
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:43:41
I guess this is a joke... stupid me. It was on the news anyway. I wasn't watching close enough. Meh.. I was ready to pull the trigger anyway.

Interesting... I have to admit I'm a dunce investor. I'll have to research what mempool spam is, lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:45:14
Lol, just a random thought that your comment inspired.  Bitcoin is like poison to banks as fiat is like fertizer to them.  Why would someone who is making gazzilions and is beholden to his fiat peeps choose to invest in weed killer?  I wouldn't either if I was Warren money bags Buffet, lol.

As mentioned in another post, the blood is in the water...no surprise to see sharks circling in.

It has like 300% the normal caffeine levels of regular coffee and in some cases thousands of sugar calories. Starbucks is a legal drug dealer at every corner. I'm not against caffeine, but massive doses of caffeine is going to make a regular cup of coffee pretty useless in short order.

Hehe, good point.  He's the house right now.  The house always makes money. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:39:52
Yeah... Exactly... I just bought because of this, but someone else here said it is fake?
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:09:10
Yeah... Maybe he has realized just that.  Some people think he is very greedy.  They figure if he doesn't like it maybe they should, lol.  So now his strategy is to act neutral like it doesn't bother him to avoid making it more public by blabbing about it.

Huh, I wonder what their holdup is.  The lack of support for these services at this point reminds me of how risky of an investment bitcoin really is.  On the other hand, it is kind of interesting how well the system does work even with a lack of substantial support services. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:26:46
Eventually... :/  maybe they should charge a little for their app so they can make important updates...as a newcomer to bitcoin I find it strange that these basic improvements aren't priority   But, I guess this stuff is still in its infancy.

There is some wonky problem with segwit and mycelium.  If you just bought your trezor it is probably setup as a segwit wallet.  Mycelium won't work with it and there does not seem to be any interest from Mycelium to update their app to work with a segwit wallet.  I guess the only way to make it work right now is to setup a "legacy" wallet which I have no idea how to do...
Also, the trezor manager app is practically useless so don't expect that to be an option.

I keep buying at new ATLs lol! Living the excitement in reverse order. Oh well... I hit my limit now it's time to wait through the long winter. I hope Bitcoin and Litecoin survive. I love the idea of crypto. I don't even care if it makes some random bitcoin Jesus weirdly rich. I just love the idea of an absolute fire storm of financial upheaval aimed right at the banks. It's a tough one though. The banks are pretty mafiosaish. Its gonna be a long and bumpy ride to put the big banks at defcon15. There are certainly people that would love to see crypto die a spectacular death. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:52:15
Yeah, exactly. It's easy to look back. Just like if you bought $1000 worth of bitcoin at the start you would be a millionaire today. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:53:23
Yeah, I'm locked at loaded to make another purchase. One more for the year for me so I'm trying to make the best of it. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:44:35
This reminds me of the concept of bailing out giant banks because letting them fail will have serious reprocussions. So, the banks have everyone by the balls. I say flush Coinbase straight down the toilet if they are determined to be a stinky turd. Bitcoin will survive Coinbase or not. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:46:45
Well, I imagine there are more people that have a ton of bitcoin from back in the day that are becoming instant millionaires right now. Plus, there are some individuals with insane amounts of bitcoin that could sell and bring it down pretty good. Then you have wives that are shitting their pants about how their husband dumped half their 401k into bitcoin and are freaking out. The stock market took a giant stinky turd. Trump is a dumbass. People are greedy. People are scared.... Ahhhhhhh... The sky is falling, lol! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:55:43
Yeah, I do get why people think this is a big deal. If I were a bank executive and was doing my job right I would be looking to stomp bitcoin out of existence. 
Bitcoin has a tough road ahead. It's a huge gamble. Right now it seems to be good for storing value and taking profits. It needs to become more functional.

Ok, thanks for giving me a clue.  It is hard to believe that coinbase has the balls to charge  that kind of fee.  It makes them look like a scam.  It is worse than the big banks this technology is supposed to be such a great threat to.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:41:14
Anyway, will try the gdax route.  Glad I tested these freaks with a small amount of cash.  They have got to be just slaying poor people.  It seems very scummy to me.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:57:43
Yeah, a stupid tax, lol.  Now that I think about it it makes sense.  Oh well, lesson learned.  Thanks for replying to me.  It gave me a bad taste but it makes sense.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:57:45
Yeah, I guess $2 is a pretty low learners fee.  It got me here where you guys clued me in quick, so thanks for that.  
I just don’t remember coinbase telling me what they were going to charge for the transfer.  Maybe I just didn’t see it for some reason. 
I guess the other question is how do you easily minimize purchasing fees?  Is there a little secret to that one too?  Is the best/only real option to minimize purchasing fees to link to a checking account?  To be honest, I’m a little paranoid of letting any of these fledgling institutions have transfer access to my checking account.  I’d rather have the force of a credit card company if something shady happens.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:43:03
I feel like I should have sold a little at 20k. I should have known better. It went too high too fast. I could have re-invested to get some extra. Oh well, hindsight is 20/20 and I'm in it for the long haul anyway. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:38:23
Lol, an expense?  More like bend over with no lube.
