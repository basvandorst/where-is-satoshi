1. Are normal H&amp;R Block-type accountants going to be able to deal with this? I bought and sold all year, can I just hand it to them and they'll understand how to do cost basis? They weren't massive amounts, is there a threshold at when I even need to report it?
2. If I sent BTC to someone to buy something, how do I prove to the government what happened? Do I need to pay taxes on it? Again, this wasn't a massive amount, don't know if there's a threshold.

Damn, didn't know that, thanks for the response. Tried my hand at cost basis a few years ago, screwed up slightly, got a terrifying bill from the IRS, and communicating with the IRS was Kafka-esque, so I resolved not to do my own taxes anymore. Guess I'll find someone other than H&amp;R Block though.

Ha, damn, really? Should I just google some CPA to do my taxes or something?
I am a bright enough person but messed up my taxes slightly a few years back and dealing with the IRS was a nightmare. I decided then I'd never file my own taxes again but I don't know how to find an accountant that'd be worth the price other than H&amp;R Block, since my taxes aren't particularly complicated.

How about if you bet and lost in an online bitcoin sportsbook? Can I show the IRS those losses, or is it illegal to have bet, so that will create further problems? And if I lost it, do I have to pay taxes on it?

Yeah I mean, I agree that I worry about H&amp;R but I don't necessarily know who else to use. That's sort of the point of my question though...Is this a trivial task for potentially substandard accountants, in that it's not different from any other investment? Or would people not previously versed in Bitcoin be totally baffled by what to do?
