Botnets could take a large bite out of botnets too. Anyone can pool funds to initiate an attack.

That is because what you describe is not a system. It is anarchism, agorism, freedom, chaos. Read about "Dunbars number".  Shared values are not ubiquitous, and so large systems will always be corrupted by central power held by those who use force to inflict their values on others. This article reads like a kindergarten lesson on working together for "the greater good". Cute, but nothing new here, and even less about Bitcoin. Sorry but true. Good for you though, for seeking solitude for the goal of perspective; everyone could benefit from lessons in self-reliance because god knows we've had enough lessons in other-reliance.

Tumble and mix always sounded like laundering to me. Why not just use words like fungible, equitable, interchangeable, cashable, that sort of thing. Tumbling and mixing are techniques to achieve fungibility, or cash-like interchangeability. Whereas focusing on the tumbling/mixing process would lead one to believe Bitcoin is adding an optional obfuscation mechanism, rather than subtracting/correcting a privacy bug/vulnerability.

holding tether is practically no different than holding dollars on an exchange balance. the only minor difference is you can use the token in a few different places.  
printing tether is just something fun for pot smokers to talk about. tether trading makes up a small percent of bitcoin trading volume. so all the paranoid theories are way overblown.  
they say tether doesn't actually have the dollars to back the tokens. but the exact same is true of your us dollar balance on every major exchange. the only difference is that the public can see when tether prints new dollars. so they love to make up stories about the correlation with price movements. correlation is not causation. it's the flat earther movement of crypto.

"same utility" is wrong. you can't trade $100,000,000 on these shitcoins without causing their market to crash. you can't trust these shitcoins to secure the network because they aren't decentralized. every shitcoin is vulnerable to attack. bitcoin is less vulnerable by an order of magnitude at least.  network effect is real. liquidity is real. human capital is real. physical infrastructure is real. support from the community is real. you can't just clone bitcoin's code and get all of that. shitcoins will stay irrelevant until they PROVE they are better. writing software is easy. implementation of a global network is hard. and if they happen to prove they are better, bitcoin can just steal that idea from them. so good luck shitcoins. you have quite a hill to climb.

depends which kind and how you do it. lbc is an escrow service, but reversal fraud is quite common. perhaps less so now that lbc has a kyc process. wire transfers, moneygram, and western union are the safest because they are not reversible. cash deposit in your bank account is also a fairly safe method if you bank doesn't block it.  either way, you should educate yourself of the risks of the method you want to use.  
it might be easier for you to just open an exchange account. you'll have less risk.

as fungible as the us dollar at least.  the war on all forms of cash is real and happening, but all currencies are generally, in practice, fungible with a few caveats.  fungibility is more a question of the people using the currency than it is of the currency itself. you can choose to accept any bitcoin. and so can i. better privacy protections are coming.

if you're holding a small amount long term, a paper wallet is perfectly fine as long as you generate it properly. but perhaps equally as easy would be to generate an electrum wallet offline on some machine and then delete the wallet and save the seed phrase like you would a paper wallet. for maximum security, wipe that hard drive before connecting to the internet again, or leave it offline permanently.

no. if you have them deposit, then you don't need to "pull" anything because you already have it.  you either have them pay up front, or not. crypto is explicitly a consent based system. the only "pull" system i can imagine for crypto would involve a 3rd party escrow where the customer has the ability to remove consent through an agreed-upon process.

tether is a tiny percent of bitcoin trading. tether is just a counterparty holding dollars for exchanges.  if you could see the dollars flowing into exchanges (multiples of 5 billion for sure), would you be as concerned?  it just means a tightening pattern is about to break out, or already has. it's money flowing. tether might not be holding all those dollars, and your exchange might not be either. insolvency risk is always there, no matter who is holding your dollars. tether just makes a good story, because you can see a part of it that you can't see on exchanges. so everyone likes to talk about it and make up stories about the parts they don't understand or have any knowledge about.

you're right that's a govt purchased device most likely. consider getting an emf detector (and remember these devices often sleep for periods to avoid detection). and if you're really feeling brave, you can make a low power jammer, although you could get in trouble for that. also get a faraday bag for your mobile devices when traveling or not using (powering off is not enough). because if they did that to your car, they have also targeted your home network and devices including your router. this investigation may include your friends. use proton mail, and encourage your friends and family to use it as well. although targeted surveillance is pretty hard to beat, unless the investigation is superficial or low priority. if you really need a private channel with someone, you both need burner devices running tor and encrypted messaging like proton mail, or something like it.

The fee to send $1million worth of bitcoin is pennies.  Try doing that with a bank. Also, you don't see credit card fees because they are hidden in the purchase price of your merchandise. Further, have you ever tried to send a moneygram or western union? Bitcoin blows those fees out of the water. Same with paypal in most instances.  And as a bonus, you get censorship resistance and financial sovereignty like the world has never seen. And finally, have you heard of lightning network? Practically free to use, and instant payments.

you *might* have luck on bisq or mycelium localtrader. or perhaps meeting someone through craigslist or meetup.  it will be a challenge without an "adult" helping, but not impossible. bitcoin is open to everyone. it's banking services that aren't.  when you buy using alternative, unregulated methods, be careful of scams. demand at least 1-3 confirmations, verified on your own choice of block explorers, before you hand over the cash. that is if you're not using a well-known and researched escrow service.

tether is just dollars pegged to a coin. it's useful for exchanges that don't have banking relationships, so they can list usd/btc pairs without having to send or receive dollars to and from people's bank accounts.  to say it's "popular" is not quite right. tether is useful in this regard because banking relationships are very hard to get for a crypto company.   
and xrp is corporate crypto, like paypal, but the value of your balance fluctuates. xrp is neither censorship resistant, nor open to everyone. to even consider it a crypto is pushing it. they can be shut down, and are susceptible to all sorts of central points of failure. bitcoin cannot and is not.

Nah. It's not "honesty" that creates prosperity. It's freedom. You can't have an "honest" massive govt. *Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.* A govt's budget is the size of its honeypot. When you concentrate power, it attracts the worst and most corrupt. It may attract the best as well, but you can't weed them out. So the bigger the budget, the more power, the more corruption, and the worse corruption. A minimal govt that becomes corrupt isn't very dangerous. A big one is very dangerous. Honesty is rare.And democracy has no magical truth detector. Let's be honest about it.

That number would essentially represent all the fiat currency in the world right now. It sort of assumes that bitcoin takes over as the global reserve currency.  Other reasons it could reach that value include dollar devaluation and hyperinflation.  In the short run, the number 100k is fairly improbable. But possible.  More realistic would be a number that would rival the market cap of gold, which is 7 trillion usd, or approx equiv to $33k/bitcoin.

The embedded video should centered. And the images below are dark and shadowy.  A "levels" adjustment in photoshop or gimp would help.    
But the most noticeable thing for me is the top image of the girl. It says absolutely nothing about the product you're selling.  Consider replacing all of the video and imagery with a single slideshow or gif image at the top, which shows everything you want to show.  But primarily, show the product in action, because that's the cool part. You have to grab them right away. Front and center. The whole page should basically be a product image or gif that says it all. Then a buy button. The text is secondary.

brd has nothing to do with it. use any wallet you like. make sure it is open source, or else the bitcoin isn't actually in your possession.  shop for an bitcoin exchange.  coinbase is good for noobs. however noobs will pay a price for convenience, so it won't exactly be "cheap" in terms of fees, or in terms of the spread these services take from the price.    
the cheapest way to buy is in bulk, using wire transfers, to a major exchange. coinbase pro is a market leader, but there are a few others, assuming you are in the US.  itbit is currently offering fee rebates for limit orders, so they actually pay you a small amount when your order is filled.
once you open your account, you can set a "limit order", which is the lowest-fee type of order. a limit order is where you set the price you want to pay, and the order is automatically filled when that price is reached in the order books. the only downside, is that the price may never be reached.  the alternative is a "market order", which buys whatever is available at the front of the order book, and at whatever price is currently being offered.  the fee is higher, and the risk of slippage could mean that you pay even more than you thought you would because there wasn't enough bitcoin available at the current price to fill your order.  
if this all sounds too complicated, just open a coinbase account and pay like all the other noobs. you'll figure it out eventually.

price isn't "determined". no such thing as "the price" of bitcoin. the price *you pay* is a negotiation between you and the seller. that's how exchanges work. you place an order where you want it.  the price quotes you see are merely the current order amount, which is merely an offer for a certain amount of bitcoin. it could be a fraction of 1 bitcoin that is available at that price.

they are your coins with brd. their recovery process creates a sort of dependence on their service existing in the future, but there is a failsafe that ensures the worst you experience is a delay in getting your keys. i wouldn't use them, but im not a noob. i have no problem with their service or wallet. it's open source, secure, and has a pretty good rep. i would pick electrum or mycelium before them however. that is if you don't want to run a full node.

You would be smarter to just claim the $1,000,000 Millennium Prize for solving it.  Bitcoin would simply fork as soon as you tried to break it, and you might end up in jail instead.  No way you can steal it "all" without causing a fork, and causing the price to fall so much that your loot was now worthless.   
The implications for this "solution" (as if there is one), are much wider reaching than bitcoin. AES encryption would be broken, in addition to hashing and all forms of public key cryptography.  The military implications are far bigger than measly bitcoin.

"The fed" isn't a living thing, and doesn't get scared. Nor do its members get scared. They are getting paid regardless of what happens to the economy as a result of their monstrous thievery. You don't really think they care about the dollar's global dominance, do you? No, it's a race to the bottom, while they appease political leaders in return for their job, while they all *coincidentally* agree that more spending is mo' better, and they loot the coffers from their mansions, while everything burns around them.  
 It's absolutely impossible for a population to be smart enough to vote the thieves out of office, because all these children and retards can do is vote for more "free" stuff, feeding the whole cycle of economic demise.    
 People really do believe that money (and therefore value) is created by government. They won't figure it out until it's too late. It's really too late already, and everyone is clueless, begging for more govt spending, money printing, both real and in the sneaky form of anti-market interest rates.

for any market, a rich and diverse price discovery process is essential for stable prices and to attract serious bidders. the more people, and the more money, that agrees on the price of bitcoin, the more believable the price is to potential buyers. 
this particular kind of futures contract, as in bakkt, is seen as better than previous attempts because it is designed to be settled in actual bitcoin rather than cash.  this reduces the price manipulation schemes that can arise from such a product.  it also provides an addition on-ramp for cash into the market, for more actual bitcoin ownership.  it also opens this market to the NYSE, and markets in over 30 countries, so it's huge.

because miners don't control consensus. all stakeholders have to agree or capitulate to the new rules. that includes nodes, businesses, exchanges, developers, wallet makers, and all of their customers and investors... each stakeholder has a strong mechanism for resistance. any attempt would immediately create a contentious hard fork, and the malicious fork would be removed from the network, and their coins and transactions invalidated. only the miners who keep mining the true consensus rules would be rewarded with new coins. the contentious fork would not be listed on exchanges, and would be ostracized from the market from many directions.   
 in short, nobody is buying their newly minted shit.

Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin. and Blockstream is not Bitcoin Core.  Get it straight.    
There are 100s of bitcoin developers, and 1000s if you includes their teams of testers etc.  And they are working on a bunch of separate bitcoin implementations. A small handful of those are paid by blockstream to work on one of the many implementations of bitcoin node software, bitcoin core.
Most of the devs working on bitcoin core do not work for blockstream. Blockstream, and developers in general, don't dictate the future of bitcoin development. Consensus by a wide array of stakeholders determines the direction of bitcoin. Not devs, not miners, not exchanges, not governments...

Technologies aren't always used as their creators "intended". Bitcoin is being used more and more, and in whatever way people want to use it. You claim it's "speculation", as if that is illegitimate or less meaningful. The press has been using this term for a long time to try to illegitimize rational trading behavior in a free market. It's just someone to blame when things don't go your way.  People are using bitcoin for whatever they want to use it for, whether you think it's legitimate or not. Bitcoin is succeeding. Some people want bitcoin to be something else; Good luck shaping that future. Meanwhile, technology is adopted and entrenched in real-world uses despite your objections about how it was "supposed to be used". I think we're seeing that the market wants and needs something like bitcoin; So when you say "speculation" to demean the current trading and usage behaviors, I think  that's wrong-headed. Ask why they are speculating. Speculators and users are not mutually exclusive. Not even close. Users speculate, and speculators use. You may have to wait until the current growth patterns slow before you see the changes you desire. Market forces are strong.

Neat theory, but a 1 day delay would only affect a persons ability to sell for 1 day (and only for those who are not active traders who keep their coins on the exchange or in a margin account). The next day they sell, and the price goes down. This rally has been continuing now for many months and most days have had no such delays. If you're trying to explain this most recent 2% leg in the very long and consistent rally (of +100% in just a few months) then over the next few hours we should see a big crash (of 2%).

Block increase is risky. Segwit achieves modest scale for now. The miners will decide eventually. Reddit is so impatient. I cannot see any major scaling change without first a clear message from the market, or incentive from a real competitive threat. The price must stagnate for months or crash,and it must be clear that it's related to scaling issues. I don't see any other way unless we get lucky and the bitcoin media, devs, and blogosphere are able to convey a convincing and clear message to sway the decisions, which they have been unable to do so far.
I think you'll have to wait a long time for scaling because of the current nature of incoming money. Bitcoin is being used as a safe haven asset increasingly. This money doesn't care much about scaling. The speculators of course do, and they make up the majority, or at least they have up to now. I think we are seeing lots of investors come in who don't care about scaling. Sorry, but I think it means we may wait a long time (internet time anyway).

Another decentralization zealot. The creative process is one of centralization in to some form or another. Formation is centralization. It's not centralization that is bad. It's government violence and threats of death that incentivize banking cartels, not just "centralization". Decentralization is not the antithesis to what's wrong in banking. Individual choice is. The market, and by that I don't mean a centralized organization, but collections and instances of individuals making free choices, is who will decide which, if any, crypto currency they will purchase and use. Don't "Decentralize all the things" as the saying goes, please do not; No one wins when everybody loses because they are not allowed to organize with shared interests without being shouted down as "Centralizers of all the things". Decentralization used to mean something specific, not this incoherent political ideology that would negate all cooperation in the world when taken to its logical end.

You will get fucked over. To be a seller on that site, you need to be willing to be fucked over. You have to build it into your fees, and try to manage the risk the best you can. The most experienced sellers can offer lower fees because they have fine tuned their risk profile. It takes time to learn, and you have to be willing to lose some money (and time, and maybe even bank accounts, paypal accounts) learning. Over time, if you are good, you will make it back by setting appropriate fees, and making good choices.

In a sense derived from an inaccurate definition of democracy. All definitions of democracy I have ever seen involve votes from people, not from machines. Nobody wants to be ruled by a majority of machines, or by any thing for that matter except for those who believe the popular vote of ill-informed people means they can enforce their opinion on others. Democracy and politics have nothing to do with the will of the people, and everything to do with enabling a central power to do violence upon dissenters.  Free market activity, on the other hand, is when value is exchanged freely between people who voluntarily agree that the exchange benefits and satisfies them. "Votes of confidence" in your "sense" in no way counter-act the votes of value made in every free exchange of bitcoin for value.  Money talks; Or more accurately: Value talks, resources talk. Votes are just beliefs in illegitimate power to control people, or a non-binding appeal to some central authority to take action. They don't mean anything. Whether they deserve consideration or not, will be decided by the voluntary exchange of resources that follow, not by whether or not you think the vote means something.

You use bitcoin for everything, but you don't know how to answer this question? Hmm, okay I'll take troll bait. Try VIABTC Transaction accelerator if you have a real need (their throughput is limited obviously so please be considerate). Before sending a transaction, especially one you want to happen quickly, check blockchain.info Unconfirmed Transactions. If it's over 20 or 30K, it may take a while unless you pay a larger fee. The network is currently being spammed most likely as a political statement to push an agenda. So yes there are delays. However, I just sent a transaction with my ledger nano and automatic fee calculation, and it was confirmed within 10 minutes no problem despite the current transaction queue of 90k.

Considering your age, I assume your access to banking is limited or nil (?) So poloniex is probably fine. "Trust" level is subjective and relative. To get a general idea, look at the trading volumes to find the "most trusted" exchange; Being "most trusted" doesn't mean the most trustworthy but you'll get 100 different answers about who is best. Make sure they have the currencies pairs your want to trade. Just take your time and don't trust them too much.  Get ready to lose some money too.  Investing, as opposed to trading, is big picture thinking. Understand by stating you want to "invest in different cryptocurrencies", you are confirming a bias for a bullish cryptocurrency market, or at least for certain parts of the cryptocurrency market. Make sure you understand the difference between trading and investing. Traders can make money in a bull market, or a bear market. Investors only make money in bull markets by picking winners. You're assuming there will be winners by investing. Just know that.

A full node allows you to completely remove any trusted 3rd parties from your client/wallet infrastructure. Miners, and full nodes are the main essential parts of bitcoin.  The non-technical users normally interact with the bitcoin network via an SPV client/wallet, which employs a shortcut method for interacting with the bitcoin network whereby a user can avoid downloading an entire copy of the blockchain to verify their transactions. SPV wallets/clients are in some ways less "trustless" than a full node because you are connecting to an SPV node and they are abbreviating the blockchain for you, albiet in a verifiable way. The benefits of a full node are first and foremost self-serving. Full nodes have the most verifiably accurate transaction history for you to use; These full nodes also provide redundancy and decentralization which add to the robustness and security of the network.

It is evident that such well-established corporatist-fascist control of industry is indeed empirical evidence of government influence in Chinese Bitcoin industry; The extent and degree to which their influence is currently effective, and precisely toward which ends their influence means to be effective, would be good to know but this is not essential in judging the risk of future influence to be a reasonable factor in making certain decisions.

Every time I see a post about how "lies" "deceit" "half-truths" are evidence of conspiracy, I roll my eyes. Lies are not a problem in the long run. The truth will emerge, and if Bitcoin's future depends on the honesty of people, then it's doomed from the start. This constant flow of posts crying "liar liar" is just an appeal to short-term emotional responses. The real truth is that you don't know, because you can't know, what is a lie because you cannot know a person's intent; Intent is private, even more private than a key. You can only do your argument a disservice by calling your opponent a liar. Call him wrong and the argument can continue; Call him a liar, and he leaves. Psychoanalysis and game theory of liar name-calling might suggest that you want your opponent to leave, rather than do the hard work of honing your argument.

These 2 things are not mutually exclusive. Nobody knows what's going to happen in future free market activity. One could likely forsee a scenario where LN was implemented and did in fact reduce fees. I doubt fees are playing a big role in the current debate, because fees don't play a big role in miner revenue. It's mainly the futurists and ideologues that care about fees because the fee's eventual importance is a matter of conceptualization and prediction, not economic reality.  This debate is about one broadly defined subject area, it goes by different names: decentralization, control, monopoly, state influence, corporate influence, financial influence, class warfare, trust, and uncertainty.

* If Bitmain is a ASIC manufacturer, how do they control the signaling? Do they also control mining pools? What percent exactly, and to what extent does their control necessarily dictate the signaling within the pool? 
* If this is a defacto 51% attack by who is essentially a single entity, then the bitcoin public needs to know the facts.  Andreas Antonopoulis, being probably the most trusted voice in Bitcoin (for the general public),  has historically assured us that Chinese centralization is not much of a concern, because miners would switch pools if hashing power consolidated too much. Is Chinese centralization in fact a much deeper concern than previously thought?
* Precisely how do we measure Bitmain's direct, real influence on signaling? I mean without invoking conspiracy theories that cannot be proven.

The miners probably don't mind much. I wonder if the sat/B tends to stay high during and after these "attacks", and how much the miners have gained overall as a result. Maybe it's not as expensive an attack as it seems (I mean these "spam" transactions do have reasonable fees from what I can tell). Maybe just the biggest pool could coordinate these attacks and see a marginal profit over time, while at the same time pushing their "blocks are full" narrative. I'm sure I'm not the first to think of this.  Either way, I doubt this ends with bigger blocks, or with segwit. Freedom comes at the cost of lots of noise and unpredictability. I'm okay with it.

The number of people who owned bitcoin when the price was under $100 is very few; And even 400% annualized return isn't the kind of thing that makes everyone involved rich. Only those who bought a lot early. Very few. That said, bitcoin trading can be as profitable as trading any commodity if you are knowledgeable about it. You can buy bitcoin for less than a penny (assuming you found a seller), so I don't know why you think affordability is a problem. The quantity of a single bitcoin is meaningless and arbitrary because it can be (practically) split infinitely. The question you should ask is not if you can afford it, but if it's a good value.

Perhaps defining our terms would be a good start. Whose opinion matters ultimately? I mean in making the decision to move forward (not in deciding whether the outcome is good or bad)? The market ("most people" in your definition?) will decide that. 
I ask this because I wonder to what degree you, or anybody weighing in on the matter, merit(s) authority in this decision. I would suggest anyone who puts forward an argument for or against any proposal, first puts forward a description of their merits to be an authority on the matter. Not as a purely hierarchical social status, but as a description of the context from which this opinion arises. The vitriol is coming from wilful ignorance of the opponents viewpoint. 
For historically contentious arguments in general, if you can't make a convincing case from your opponents position, then you don't understand his position well enough to defeat it in an argument. This leads to wasteful slinging of insults, and presuming evil intentions from your opponent; Once they are evil, anything goes in defeating them. War ensues.

It's difficult to know for sure because orders are not necessarily showing on the books. An order can come from anywhere at any time. 1 order doesn't effect the price "in the whole market".

$12 per unit, plus another 10-12% in ebay/paypal fees + shipping, plus his seller margin of at least 5-8% for market risk. So $100 of btc would cost approx $130 or more. A buyer would be much better off using LBC and paying 8-15% for a paypal transaction. The seller is not better off though, because LBC paypal reversals are rampant. Probably 10%+ of sales are reversed until clientele is well established on LBC. Interesting, I wonder how his sales are. Considering lots of people get discounted (or gifted) ebay gift certificates, he might actually do some decent sales.

The largest network, and the slowest design will tend to be the most secure. There is a tradeoff between speed and security, but also between size and security. Further, for an altcoin to be an alternative, it needs to be accepted by the business partner or merchant. Alts are not being used.

The blockchain is a permanent public record of every transaction. The records show the source address, destination address and amount. So everything is traceable in that sense.  However the blockchain does not contain private information. No identity, no ip address, nothing.  However, businesses, exchanges, on-ramps, etc, all keep records including bitcoin addresses and identity information. So the data is all there to connect identity to bitcoin.  Therefore staying anonymous on bitcoin requires you to avoid giving your private data to 3rd parties, who will leak it inevitably.  It can be done, but it's a challenge.
@_date: 2019-11-30 05:34:25
production costs don't determine value. the market does. each individual making a voluntary trade decides. value is subjective ultimately.  
many things are produced which are worthless or worse.  and in bitcoin's case the consensus value has tended toward being more than the sum of its production costs.  
there is no way to calculate what something is worth to everyone else. you can only determine it's value to you at this moment in time, compared to the value you perceive in the assets you have available to trade.  
if you value 1 bitcoin more than you value $7700, you will trade. if not, you won't.  the same goes for everyone.

if you use a service that requires ID, you are tracked.  
if you want to mix your coins after the fact, you can use samurai wallet.   
if you want to buy bitcoin without an ID, you can do so commercially if you are only buying very small amounts.  there are a few services (just search this sub "buy without ID").  
further, if you want to keep your bitcoin private after you buy it, you need to (properly and carefully) use a tor-enabled wallet (most of the good ones are).   
another option is of course privacy coins like monero and zcash.  
its important to realize that even if you keep your coins private when you buy them, and store them privately, you can give up your privacy when you send them to someone because presumably they know who you are if, for example, you gave them your shipping address, or logged into their website.  
privacy is not easily accomplished anywhere. especially if you are trying to stay private from government or other bad actors.

You can also exchange with monero and either hold monero, or trade it back for btc using an anonymous service.

So you need 1) an exchange to buy bitcoin with your "card" (what kind?). and 2) an open source wallet to hold your bitcoin after you buy it on the exchange.  
 If you will be holding amounts you consider large enough to worry about, then consider a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger.  You can link a hardware wallet to a software wallet on your mobile phone. For software wallets, whether or not you get a hardware wallet, consider mycelium, samurai, electrum, or a couple others. Ask if you're not sure.

Innuendo, suspicion, "findings", "study"... ZERO EVIDENCE. Of course some volumes are inflated to look good using questionable methods. Smart money knows that. And it's especially true on the shadier exchanges trying to posture for business.  And because everyone knows it, it's priced in. The notion that crypto is more corrupt than wall street is ridiculous. Regulations would merely entrench the corruption under the guise of legitimacy.  Show the evidence, and it will be priced in.

never heard of them. but some people apparently have:  
@_date: 2019-11-13 02:11:58
not exactly. they can see how much you have in that address. and they may be able to infer some things based on the connected addresses. they don't necessarily know your entire holdings.  good wallets actively try to keep it as private as possible by the way they manage addresses.    
to be more private, keep a few different wallets. samurai and wasabi are privacy focused wallets that have special features including coin control and mixing.

@_date: 2019-11-22 22:33:38
paper wallets aren't able to be used without exposing your private keys to a potentially infected, and probably online computer.  
hardware wallets though are primarily for their functionality to easily use with an online device without worrying so much about exposing your keys.  there are other cold storage methods which would probably be considered more secure, when used expertly, than using a hardware wallet.  a paper wallet is okay as long as you sweep it completely when you use it, rather than importing the private key to a device which may be vulnerable.

1. that govt can shut it down  
2.  that a 51% attack is a critical vulnerability  
3. that a copy of bitcoin with no liquidity is as good as bitcoin, or even better if it has lower fees. in other words, that bitcoin is just software that can be copied.
@_date: 2019-11-14 03:12:55
what do you mean healthy? fraudulent numbers aren't good for customers trying to decide where to trade. but eventually they figure out if the liquidity is weaker than implied, when they go to buy or sell a large order and get tons of slippage.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:32:18
Why narrow your market so much? Just trade the cash for bitcoin afterward. You'll either get a terrible price, or you won't ever sell it.

so make another shitcoin and see how that works for you. you've had 10 years to buy bitcoin, just like everyone else. and there are plenty for sale.  miners have to pay for electricity, so they have to sell some, if not most. and with all this volatility, there's plenty of opportunity for entry if you're patient.
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:57:57
it's called a wallet. choose an open source one, otherwise, it's not your bitcoin. and if you are storing large amounts, you shouldn't trust any "app" wallet but rather buy a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger.  i believe breadwallet is okay for ios.

Arbitration. Arb bots, arb traders.  And the data is live for everyone to see.  There are tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of eyes watching the market at any one time.    
Have you ever watched a live order book?  It's in constant flux. If you watch the data for a while, you'll understand.  
Further, if you have 1000 coins to sell, most likely you'll look for an OTC trade. Or at the very least, you will sell in small amounts over time. Unless of course your purpose is to trigger some sort of market action. 1000 isn't very much, but it's enough that you'll get significant slippage with a market order.

high tech devices and superstructures, and electricity delivery, aren't free. ever.  if costs are reduced, it simply makes it cheaper to run more miners, which would then be necessary to secure the network. because the cost of proof of work, the expended money and time is the security model.

you're an idiot if you think price doesn't mean anything. price is a measure of value. value is everything. price is evidence. price isn't proof, but it's definitely evidence. long term, it becomes proof.  
if the us dollar went to zero, would you still use it? i don't think so. because price is very fucking important.
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:10:58
Making something hard to obtain doesn't make it valuable. Neither is work *volume* a measure of value.  Value is subjective and ideological.  You must asses the object as good, productive, or useful in order to give it a positive value. And unless that object is the sole source of a particular human need, then its value is subjective.  Even then, a person's own estimation of the value of their own life is essential to determining the value of an object required to continue that life.  As a trader who is looking to assign value to their objects, the best you can do is look for market prices of comparable objects. In the area of new technology, where no comparison is available, you have a very complicated, actually impossible calculation. You need to predict future desirability, future utility, and future competition. That's why, until Bitcoin's place in the future financial system is established, its price discovery is going to be a challenge. I think you have to start there; at where you believe Bitcoin will fit in the future of *financial tools*, which involves also predicting the effectiveness of Bitcoin's competition within this crypto market.

Coinbase is fine if you aren't buying much bitcoin. The fees are high, but the services are tailored to noobs.

Run a node to validate your own transactions instead of depending on a 3rd party to do it for you.   
And whether you have a node or not, you are able to buy and sell without a 3rd party if you have any open source bitcoin wallet. You just have to find a buyer or seller and trade with them. You don't need 3rd party permission with bitcoin. Bitcoin is financial sovereignty.

coins that are cheap to mine are also cheap to attack (and therefore less secure, less valuable). security and freedom have a (carbon) cost. whether you use fiat or bitcoin. fiat is far more damaging to society, than purely theoretical (and often mythical) effects of co2 on the globe.   
bitcoin is using excess electricity anyway. as soon as bitcoin drives up the price of electricity somewhere, it becomes unprofitable to mine.  believe it or not, much of the energy produced by generators is wasted and not used (and so produces the carbon either way). bitcoin mining, because of the mobility of its business model, can (and does) use electricity in areas that are overproducing.     
did you know porn on the internet uses more electricity than bitcoin?  and devices on standby use more electricity than bitcoin too. there's lower hanging fruit if you want to save the planet (as if it needs to be saved).    
bitcoin is saving people from tyranny.  while these CO2 hysterics are designed only to increase govt tyranny.  i prefer mass extinction to the mass enslavement prescribed by these chicken little preachers, who have been wrong for many decades, and who continue to spread lies in support of their goals.

Have you ever seen "market prices" for fish or steak?  Or digital menus?  You lack vision if you think this is an critical obstacle for the adoption of a paradigm shifting technology.  Also being a unit of account would  almost certainly have the effect of stabilizing prices for this very reason.  Likewise, if you removed dollars from all menus and retail pricing, the value of the dollar would be less stable, less known.

1. wait it out. it will either confirm or it will eventually be cleared from the mempool. i'm guessing it confirms within 24 hours, although it could take longer.   if the mempool gets congested for an extended period, then after a couple weeks, nodes will start deleting your transaction, which will make those funds spendable again in your wallet.  
2. if your wallet allows, you can actually double-spend the transaction with a higher fee. the lower fee transaction will be ignored automatically.  there are various methods to do this:

The economy is a chaotic system. And "the bitcoin price" isn't a ubiquitous thing.  It's possible that the price is high in certain areas, and low in others, depending on the sorts of capital controls and other tyranny is instituted as a response to a given crisis.    
The question of how governments respond to the crisis will play a big role in short term price movements.  For example, if a nation devalues its currency and prints a bunch of money, then everyone's purchasing power is decreased, and that dynamic would tend to raise bitcoin's price in *nominal* terms.  But in terms of purchasing power, it's hard to say.  And again, it will vary by locale.   
Bitcoin until now, has been largely (not completely) a risk-on asset class, meaning people buy when economic outlook is good. But the theory is that bitcoin can be very useful in an environment where inflation, and maybe hyperinflation is the norm.  We'll see.  
Personally, the question of a hot war is more interesting for a sort of hyperbitcoinization, than the question of an economic downturn. And a hot war situation is just as likely IMO.  Because in a hot war, you have money printing to support the war, and you have people trying to get assets across a national border secretly. Bitcoin is the first asset which can be brought across borders without detection in a war zone. I truly believe this use case will prove a killer app of sorts in the long term.  Not that I'm wishing for major war, but history tells us it's coming eventually.  And I think those of us who have been around a while can smell it in the air.

lol. That's a feature not a bug. Financial sovereignty means personal responsibility. Nobody can or should have the power to decide if the refund is allowed or not.  That's precisely the tyranny that bitcoin is designed to mitigate, not support.
That said, companies are free to subsidize refunds, or offer insurance. Which effectively means you can get a refund, but you have to pay for the ability.  
So with bitcoin, instead of all of refunds being a cost shared by everyone, the cost is only shared among those customers who want the extra security, and willing to pay for it.  
So bitcoin doesn't prevent or exclude the ability to refund; Bitcoin offers something that never before existed; The choice to have true ownership of your money, which nobody and no thing can take away (via arbitrary refund for example).

No. Centralization of govt power (a coercive violent force unlike any other in the world) leads to that. Centralization in general is a weird thing to be against. I think people just don't like making an argument against government because it's not cool to be an anarchist or libertarian in polite society.  So they escape into the abstraction of centralization since it's just a technical attribute, not a political opinion.    
But many things are made better with centralization.  Centralization, like decentralization, is a tactic, a means to an end, not an end goal.     
In Bitcoin's case, decentralization is used to secure the immutability of the network, ensuring and creating financial sovereignty for everyone. If immutability and security was achievable without decentralization, or without as much decentralization, it would be more efficient, cheaper, faster.   
It's a trade-off between these 2 things.

I don't know if BTCPay Server specifically has that ability.  But forget automation for a second, because you simply want to create a batch transaction on a regular basis. Click send once per day, week, month, whenever you send them out.  Formulate the transaction using any variety of programmatic methods.  You can do it with an excel spreadsheet really.  You just need to gather the list of addresses and amounts, and plug that into a transaction template.  Then import that as a raw transaction into any wallet you choose.

No. All bitcoin trading is real. Reported volume from shitty exchanges is questionable. No evidence by the way, just speculation. Everyone already knew volumes are inflated.

nope. all. bitcoin is not run by majority miners. a valid transaction is a valid transaction. breaking consensus would get those miners kicked from the network. if there were a lot of them, it would fork bitcoin into 2 coins, and all of the consensus stakeholders would be involved in deciding which fork went forward as the real bitcoin (users, merchants, exchanges, devs, etc...).

bitcoin's price reflects its utility. the only way the price is destroyed permanently is if the utility is destroyed. so you're asking the wrong question if you're trying to predict bitcoin's death.  just look at the market for immutable value transfer, for financial sovereignty. if bitcoin gets serious competition, then you can start worrying about its demise.

transaction growth is underwhelming. lightning network adoption on exchanges and merchants is practically non-existent.  mining centralization remains a concern, not that the concern is terribly warranted. it remains nonetheless.  the threat from govt crackdowns remains a consideration to short and medium term investors, and some believe even long term.  on-chain privacy remains pitiful for the average user, with only modest improvements on the horizon.  wallet UI is still too complicated for most people, and wallet marketing far too confusing and deceptive.   scams and exchange hacks are a PR nightmare.

no sir, no single key. what you get is a wallet generation seed, which only you know. the seed produces a practically infinite source of public/private pairs. you will get a new address with every transaction unless you choose to use the same one. 
ps. hardware wallets are extremely secure against hacking, as long as your seed is secure. if someone steals your wallet, and has extreme technical capabilities, they could get your keys, but in the time it took them to do so, you could use your (hopefully securely stored) seed to move your coins to another wallet.

Better to hand-write the wallet, but this is a minor detail for security paranoia. Also, another nuance: You don't generate your address when you're online at bitaddress.org. You download the html and generation script (as instructed) and generate on an offline secure machine. A signature-verified Tails live-os CD is a pretty good choice for security, but as long as it's an offline machine you trust.

fees are a separate market from bitcoin price.

Just pick a popular open source wallet. Definitely not exodus since it's closed source.  As for security, if you don't have a hardware wallet to pair with your software wallet, then make sure you enable the non-SMS 2FA option. No single device is secure if it is connected to the internet (can't emphasize enough).  Electrum for desktop, Mycelium or Breadwallet or Jaxx for mobile. A few others too... And if you have a bitcoin savings that you don't intend to touch very often, then just put it on a hand-written paper wallet and store it in duplicate in a fire safe or something like that.

Yes, something like $100 shouldn't be too hard. Paxful and localbitcoins can be a little "scammy", but not usually for buyers if you're careful. Sellers are usually scammed with payment reversals. But as a buyer, you're pretty safe because of the escrow service provided by the website (lbc, paxful specifically).  Just make sure you don't release escrow until you get the bitcoin, and that you are careful to keep proof of your payment, or whatever.
@_date: 2019-11-08 02:50:07

electrum has a 2fa scheme as well  
hardware wallets are arguably even better than 2fa.   just remember if your 2fa device is the same one as your wallet, you aren't really getting the benefits of 2fa.  ideally, your 2fa device can be an extra device which you keep offline permanently after you install the 2fa app.

1. No, it's a bad idea because giving your money to someone to hold is a bad idea.  
2.  Forget USB. Use a paper wallet if you just want to store your bitcoin; Use a hardware wallet if you want to transact regularly.  You can also use a free software wallet, but make sure you enable either: Non-SMS 2FA on a physically separate device, or; Enable multi-sig, also using a physically separate device. A software wallet without some kind of 2nd factor is only as secure as the device you are using (not very secure).

People who overpay will not survive, so don't worry about that. Fee "estimation" algos are the problem. We need a true free market in fees. Wallet functionality and UI needs serious improvement with the integration of a set of customizations for fee "offering" (not "calculation" or "estimation"). Perhaps some major wallets could get together and develop a fee bidding system that could utilize some fancy financial instrumentation, or a kind of collective bargaining for fees.  We need innovation in this area.

They havent been "given" anything. And by the way,  a "form of centralization" is not an argument against anything. Noboby wants pure decentralization nor can anyone describe a reality where this exists.  If you think certain types and degrees of centralization are bad, then make a fucking argument and stop drinking the "Decentralize All Things" Koolaid.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:48:32
Technically yes they can, but I doubt any compliance departments would allow it. Most likely you have to wire it back to you, then wire it out to the new exhange.

@_date: 2019-11-12 00:05:26
it's fine if he doesn't keep the keys online.  and while it's of course cheaper than a hardware wallet, it can hardly be compared because he doesn't really have quick access to transactions. maybe that's fine for him, but a hardware wallet is for making regular transactions.

how much is available? and what will people sell it for when govt starts trying to buy it all?  so then they have it "all". now what do they do with it? and what is it worth?
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:28:08
Some, depends on amount usually. Localbitcoins, Paxful, Bitquick.co, Bisq, Mycelium Localtrader, etc.. Ideally, befriend a miner or trader or merchant through a bitcoin meetup or the like.

@_date: 2019-03-14 14:58:53
It's unique because nobody controls it, no matter who made it. Maybe the govt did create bitcoin. It doesn't matter because it's inherently unable to be controlled by govt. If it was controlled, it would just be a copy of the dollar system, not bitcoin. Govt already has a controlled monetary system. Copying bitcoin would just would just be a willful destruction of their own currency, and an admission that bitcoin is better.   
If they can't print money and credit at will, then they lose control of their country.

You throw around terms like currency and money and investment without defining them. Bitcoin has always been volatile, so these "forces" you imagine to be fighting each other is nothing but a bunch of pictures in your head. Bitcoin is bitcoin, not precisely like anything else you mention.

Risk is freedom. It's about time the risk-averse babies that populate socialist, "progressive" and the "liberal" discourse of "regulate everything" learned this. If you want to wait until Bitcoin price plateaus so it can be another "safe space", then go ahead; I'm sure most of the population will wait there with you. Meanwhile, the people interested in freedom, and they who educate themselves about the evils of our banking system, and of central planning--they will profit while you sit on the sidelines complaining you can't make a living wage without taking a risk.

No, that's a short-sighted rationalization used by the feds when they counterfeit your money and claim they are stimulating by destroying our future value, and encouraging wasteful spending so they can grow their debt higher without having to pay back the same value in purchasing power.

He never said he hates it. You're lying. He also hasn't predicted "a crash of it". Where is your source? He says it's a "speculative asset", and he's right. Bitcoin enthusiasts like to say bitcoin is "digital gold", so Peter rightly responds by saying it has NOT proven itself a long term "store of value" like his clientele tends to demand. He's right Bitcoin hasn't proven itself long term, or stable. So he doesn't recommend it to his clients.  
Peter is on our side; He advocates "sound money". He has objections to investment advisers recommending Bitcoin. I don't see the problem.

First, to eliminate your future confusion: Blockchain.info is NOT "blockchain". There's an important distinction like Bitcoin.com is not Bitcoin, not even close.  
Next regarding your question: Blockchain.info is not a favorite wallet of bitcoiners in general, but there are worse choices.  Mycelium, Jaxx, Breadwallet, Greenaddress...others... are all better IMO.  Regarding the $3 fee, it depends what you mean by "security". If giving your property to someone else is "secure" to you, then stay with coinbase.    
But if you want to hold your own property and take responsibility for protecting it, then a software, paper, or hardware wallet are all INFINITELY superior to coinbase.   
If you're just talking about being hacked, and you don't care who holds your bitcoin, then there's probably no difference between the choices, and in fact you may be safer keeping your property with a custodian like coinbase because you may not be knowledgeable enough, or willing to learn how, to protect yourself.  
 I would encourage you to learn about bitcoin wallet security, but that's your choice.

Irrelevant why? "Advantage" is of course based on your own subjective value system but mining at scale can be more profitable depending on market conditions. In mining you pay with infrastructure investment+labor+time whereas buying is a straightforward trade of value. Either can be anonymous, so the anonymity argument is pretty weak considering the amount of investment (and physically traceable infrastructure) required for mining.

If you're using a service, the transaction fee (separate from the fee you pay to the bitcoin network) is part of your service agreement. Ask your service provider or check their website and TOS.   
If you are using an open source wallet, the fee is voluntary, but is usually calculated by the wallet. Miners usually require a fee be paid in order to have your transaction included on the bitcoin blockchain.  The best wallets let you manually enter the fee because fee estimating algorithms are notoriously clunky, and you can often get away with a cheaper fee than the wallet "calculates" for you.  
Fees on the public bitcoin blockchain are paid voluntarily using a free market mechanism. You submit your transaction and miners decide if it is big enough to be worth it for them.  For current network fee information, you can look here:

If you have a bitcoin stash you want to store until you get your hardware wallet, just use a paper wallet. It's the safest and it's pretty easy.  You can use a software wallet instead, but they are only as secure as the device you put them on (which isn't secure really if the device is connected to the internet). To counteract this device insecurity, you can use a software wallet that has 2 Factor Authentication, or you can enable a more complicated measure called Multisig, but this is for advanced users really.  Mycelium has a 2FA setup, and so does GreenAddress I believe. Perhap Breadwallet and Jaxx as well, but I forget.

The "min max price of btc" is much more than $20 for your information.  But if you want to buy btc, go to an exhange. Wire transfers do cost money.

Some exhanges have lower or no fees for "market makers". Search for the exhanges that serve you best according to your needs.

Anything held on a medium not connected to the internet is safer. All popular mobile wallets are of similar enough security; The weakness comes from being on an internet-connected device, no matter how well designed the app is by itself.  Multi-sig and 2FA (or a paired hardware wallet) are essential to have anything approaching high security on an internet-connected device. Further, your security is only as good as your behavioral security practices, OPSEC if you will.

If you have $1000s worth, get a hardware wallet. If you don't want to pay for a hardware wallet, or you aren't going to transact very often, use a paper wallet for a simple secure solution. Keeping your coins on Coinbase long term is asking for trouble of one sort or another.   
EDIT: If you insist on a software wallet, use something with 2FA (or a multisig setup) at least for reasonable security. Mycelium or breadwallet I believe for mobile. Or electrum for desktop.

Coinbase is probably the most well-established newb-friendly exchange. They offer payment methods and services you don't see elsewhere. They are the most "corporate", and so they are quite intrusive with their verification requirements, and surveillance of your transactions. It's recommended you move your bitcoin to a wallet outside of coinbase's custodial control as soon as possible to avoid them freezing your account for no good reason.
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:59:43
Impossible. Reversal risk is real and unavoidable. If you don't pay the cost of this risk explicitly via the exchange rate, then the cost has been socialized throughout the other services somehow. You pay.

It's not an application you need to purchase bitcoin; It's an exchange. A wallet is for storing and transacting after you buy. The first thing you should do is order a hardware wallet; It's the most secure and flexible way of storing your bitcoin. Next, find an exchange to purchase bitcoin. There are lots of them. If you don't care about anonymity, just find the largest, most popular exchange in your country. In the US, look at GDAX, Gemini, itBit. There is an account verification process which can be quite invasive; You can thank the USA Patriot Act for that.

There are no "bag holders" in bitcoin dummy. A bag holder is underwater, waiting for the price to rise back to their buy price. We are at ATH, so there are no bag holders. As for your future predictions of price crash, who cares? A reduced price doesn't reduce bitcoin's utility. Unless something can prove to replace bitcoin, it won't go to zero. It seems like you're imagining bitcoin takes over as the global reserve. Price doesn't matter. Functionality does. And as for your predictions, you're not the smartest guy in the room.

There is no singular "scaling debate". Technical changes are submitted in the form of BIPs. Those are open to everyone. This forum, and others will always welcome free form debate on any related subject as long as the debate is about bitcoin, and not an altcoin proposal. Contentious hard forks are considered altcoin proposals, and is where lines are drawn because that's not about bitcoin, but some new alternative competitor which obviously will meet resistance from the torch carriers. There are grey areas, and people get pissed when they are censored, but the line has to be drawn somewhere or the bitcoin project won't be conserved. Mistakes will be made. Thus we see the fracture in examples like r/btc and BCH. Bitcoin has yet to establish a clear identity; or clear roots in the financial industry. Expect drama and forks and cries of censorship for a while to come.

coinbase (and every exchange or custodial "wallet") is basically a bank in that sense. so what if people still like to pay people to hold their stuff?   
the banking system doesn't exist to hold your stuff. if that's all they did, it would be 1/1000th the size it currently is (or less), and that would be fine. it's just factually incorrect that banks primarily hold stuff for people.  
yes, the world will always want and need 3rd party custodians, and other forms of insurance.  
bitcoin, for the first time, allows the masses to hold their own stuff if they want. and without the bank counterfeiting their currency into oblivion.

of course. the dollar has lost 90+% of it's purchasing power since central banking began. the dollar chart only goes one way, esp. in the medium and long term: down. bitcoin only needs to stay the same in terms of purchasing power and your scenario will play out within a few generations at least. as if the dollar will be around that long (in which case 1 sat is infinite dollars).

define over bought and over sold. If you're talking about some nomenclature you have seen traders mention, then you're probably talking about a technical indicator called RSI.  You can go to any charting website, like tradingview, and load up one of the bitcoin charts. Add an RSI indicator to it.  Just remember "over bought" doesn't mean the price "needs" to go down, it's just an arbitrary line in the sand. You have to look at what price did historically when it hit that mark.  Study the charts and you'll see what I mean. Indicators need context; They don't tell you the future.

bitcoin core, which was generating random sets of keys you had to backup after every set of 100. this was how it was done until 2013 when bip 32 was introduced for hd wallets.

No reason to think it will go back below 800 in the short term. Just like "bubbles" happen, caused by irrational exuberance, negative bubbles also happen from irrational negativity. It is just as likely that we've been holding back from an all-time-high for years for no good reason. In this territory, people are eyeing a new ATH. How long the bulls can sustain a push forward is anyone's guess. I would say watch the volumes, and exchanges. Buy small amounts at a time. If it drops below 800 or 780, we could see a move lower. If 800 holds, we're still looking at 1300+.

If you're a day trader, the platform is a bit simple since it only allows limit orders. No margin trading, no stops. Market makers don't pay fees, which is nice; Except wire deposits are $10 each, which is okay.  Bitcoin withdrawals occur 3 times per day, and not on the weekends so that can be annoying. Bitcoin deposits occur any time, but they require like 9 confirmations I think, so it can take an hour or so.  Support is pretty responsive. It's a good trading site if you are swing trading, or an institutional investor, or if you don't need a robust day trading platform with margin and stop orders (and the price action and liquidity that comes with day traders).

bitcoin doesn't make these things impossible or difficult at all. it just makes it so that everyone isn't dependent upon a 3rd party custodian. bitcoin is opt-in financial sovereignty and personal responsibility. for those unwilling or unable to secure their own property, there's always an entrepreneur willing to help you for a fee.

probably not as long as your app is from a valid source. it's not supposed to.    
it's worth mentioning that if you are using google authenticator on the same device you use to login to your exchange, or even the same device from which you read emails, then you are nullifying much of the benefit of using 2nd factor authentication.    
and even if you are using it on a separate device, if that device is connected to the internet, it is therefore vulnerable to a targeted attack.  i suggest using a old phone or tablet and leaving it in airplane mode with all the networking disabled. or of course getting a standalone specialty 2fa device.

There's a point in even the most tyrannical regimes where the prisoners outnumber the guards to such a degree that the prisoners start running the show.  Tyranny has limits.  
Bitcoin is a direct reaction to tyranny; and is quite resistant to it.

People hate it because they advertise for their ico. But the wallet is actually good. It has a unique addon feature called localtrader for finding p2p trades in your area.  It also has a tor option, which i recommend you set before you create your wallet.  They've been around for a long time, and haven't suffered the problems like electrum has with DOS and phishing attacks.  
Worth considering for sure.

look for:   
1. a bitcoin wallet seed. it's a word list of 12-24 words. it should be saved on paper and stored somewhere safe.  or  
2. a wallet.dat file on his computer  or  
3. a bitcoin paper wallet, which is a piece of paper, usually with a QR code on it, along with a bitcoin private and public key.    
4. last resort you can look through the computer for a text or data file that contains private keys.  however this will be difficult because it is a random string.   
This might help:

Highlights for Users
1.   Dynamic plugin support: add and remove without restarting lightningd.
2.   We now ignore sync error which lnd sends if we're too slow, instead of freaking out and closing the channel.
3.  close defaults change: now unilterally closes after 48 hours if peer unreachable/uncooperative.
4.   A few operations are restricted if we're not yet synced with the bitcoin network on startup.
5.   contrib/bootstrap-node.sh script to help connect your new node to the network.
6.  Signet support: overzealously merged before bitcoind did, but now we're owning it.
7.  Bugfixes and more plugin hooks for plugin authors.
Highlights for the network  
1.  We now notice if old channels (before this node existed) close, and won't spam them in gossip.
2.  We correctly ignore unknown odd-numbered messages, as per the specification.
3.  We space out reconnection on startup if there are more than 5 channels.

The Blockstream controlled side is the same side they sometimes call the Chinese-controlled side. They can't decide who controls biticoin, but they're sure someone does. It's just a label meant to dismiss and invalidate.  Meanwhile bcash is literally controlled by a few people and is easy to attack and destroy. They accuse the other side of exactly their own faults.

Accepting bitcoin for merchandise is accepting the value of that bitcoin on the day of the merchandise sale.    
Now you can choose to hold it, or immediately convert it to dollars.  If you convert it immediately, then there is no gain or loss to report.  If you hold it, then the gain or loss reported is the difference.    
Yes, if you are going to hold it, then it's best to hold it for a year, but only if you think the value is going to go up, unless of course you want to report a loss.  If you're taking a loss, then that is a strategic decision you can make to best benefit your tax reporting.  
In short, it's not a simple answer. It depends on what you're trying to do with your losses and gains. And it depends on what you think the price of bitcoin is going to do between receiving it, and selling it for cash (or not).

new supply isn't the only thing that affects price. nobody can know if bitcoin price will go up or not. it may go down. it depends largely on how many people have already bought expecting to be able to sell when it happens. those people will sell either way.  and if there are too many sellers to make up for the reduced rate of new supply, then the price will go down.  
anyone who claims to know the price will definitely go up is a complete moron. and there are lots of them. many of whom are very good at sounding smart.

scalability issues of today’s trustless electronic cash systems such
as  Bitcoin.  However,  these  peer-to-peer  networks  also  introduce
a  new  attack  surface  **which  is  not  well-understood  today**.  This
paper  identifies  and  analyzes,  a  novel  Denial-of-Service  attack
which  is  based  on  route  hijacking,  i.e.,  which  exploits  the  way
transactions are routed and executed along the created channels
of  the  network.  This  attack  is  conceptually  interesting  as  even
a  limited  attacker  that  manipulates  the  topology  through  the
creation of new channels can navigate tradeoffs related to the way
it  attacks  the  network.  Furthermore,  the  attack  also  highlights
a fundamental design tradeoff for the defender (who determines
its  own  routes):  to  become  less  predictable  and  hence  secure,  a
rational node has to pay higher fees to nodes that forward its pay-
ments. We find that the three most common implementations for
payment  channels  in  Bitcoin  (lnd,  C-lightning,  Eclair)  approach
routing  differently.  We  begin  by  surveying  the  current  state  of
the  Lightning  network  and  explore  the  routes  chosen  by  these
implementations. We find that in the current network nearly 60%
of all routes pass through only five nodes, while 80% go through
only 10 nodes. **Thus, a relatively small number of colluding nodes
can  deny  service  to  a  large  fraction  of  the  network.**
We then turn to study an external attacker who creates links
to  the  network  and  draws  more  routes  through  its  nodes  by
asking for lower fees. We find that just five new links are enough
to  draw  the  majority  (65%  -  75%)  of  the  traffic  regardless  of
the  implementation  being  used.  The  cost  of  creating  these  links
is  very  low.

The price is a proxy for its utility. But more to your question, I think bitcoin's core utility is censorship resistant money. I don't think bitcoin's role (as the primary network for censorship resistant money) can be supplanted by a competitor or by a government. Bitcoin's core demand will always be inversely correlated with government's suppression of free trade and oppression of people.  There is no make-or-break moment for bitcoin. It's here to stay.  
There are those who dream of everyone finally agreeing (or bitcoin's value proposition finally proving) that government fiat is inferior to crypto$. I think that's a pipe dream. It's possible, but unlikely. Scaling massively would help make the argument, but I don't see bitcoin ever beating legacy centralized banking at its *particular* game. Bitcoin would have to change the game to its advantage somehow.  I don't see it yet. I mean, I see somewhat it but I don't see everyone else seeing it; and there are some other things that are going to have to happen to push things forward. With luck.

**tip1**: never send someone money based purely on an email, text, letter, phone call, or combination of these.    
**tip2**: research the existence of the company using a web search. look closely at the results. if there are only a few, be very wary.  confirm your research in forums like r/bitcoin by asking for advice and searching for previous questions about that company.  if you can't find anything, you are probably being scammed.  
  
**tip3**: verify the caller's credentials by contacting the company directly through their official website.  
**tip4**: look closely at the url they provide (don't click!). the most important part of the url is the part before and after the last dot (example xxxxxxx.**google.com**). this is the part of the address that is least likely be be faked.  in this example you can be almost sure you are actually going to a google-owned domain.  but if the caller claims to be from google, and the domain name says "google.**totallylegit.com**", you can be confident they are lying.  
**tip5**: look at the email sender address, which is often faked similarly to tip4, except the structure is a bit different, and there are many more ways to make it look legit and trick someone.  for example a fake coinbase employee might have an email like "coinbase_admin  anyone can get a gmail account, so this is a common one.  or they might have their own anonymous email server which might look like this:  admin and there are other subtle variations that can be tricky if you aren't careful.

you're right except about the tactic part. the part you don't understand is why people mention scarcity in the first place. it's because dollars aren't limited in supply. bitcoin is limited in supply.  that you can subdivide bitcoin doesn't mean there is more bitcoin. it's not inflation. its just granularity. it just means there are more parts to share among the population. subdividing a bitcoin doesn't make 1 bitcoin worth any less.  quite the opposite; it makes bitcoin more useful.

yes, every buy is also a sell.  but on exchanges, you get either market buy orders triggering a trade, or you get market sell orders triggering a trade. that's the ratio they talk about.

because people don't just hold. those once-stagnant coins are now free to roam.   
further, the guy who bought them would have bought them somewhere else. but now that somewhere else has a pile of coins they need to sell. eventually the ripple effect hits exchanges.  
even further, it doesn't really matter what actually happens. if the coins move, the price is going down because of uncertainty, perception, and to make sure the short term sellers get a bad price.  
the only thing i can imagine would stop a price crash would be some kind of publicized arrangement to keep the coins in a trust or locked in some way.

Just because "it's risky" doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. The question is not whether or not to take risk. The question is how much risk is right? So, sure, buy some btc. How much can you afford to lose in the short term? Dabble. Learn how to trade, and how markets trend. Buying "all-in" on a market top would never be advised by anyone. But a momentum play for a small amount might be a good move, or it might be a failure. Who the fuck knows?

1st you don't have to store private keys at all. But you do have to generate them from the master at least if and when you want to sign with them.  Whether you store it or not is up to you, since the seed will always generate the same list of public/private key pairs in order, as long as you use the same derivation path.    
Best practice is to use new addresses for each transaction.  This is for privacy of everyone on the network.  That's why you iterate change addresses. In fact there are LOTS of best practices you should know about if you want to develop a wallet. Check the Optech newsletter for resources.
Not sure what you are talking about with the neuter thing.  Never heard of it.  Do you mean pruned?

depends on your volume. if you buy more than a $3-5k usd worth, you can save by using wire transfers to an exchange with free limit orders. itbit for example. in fact, they are giving tiny fee rebates for limit order right now.   
whichever exchange you pick, look at their wire fees, and their withdrawal fees, if any, in addition to their market maker (aka limit order) fees.  
also consider your bank's wire fees. some banks are $50 or more, while others as low as $10-15.

if the key is private, and only you know it, then technically, broadly, by definition, you own it. it is yours and yours alone. your own key. in the same way that your thoughts are you own. you own your thoughts.  ownership is a private responsibility, not just a legal status.

they would have a mighty big job ahead of them. how much tyranny are you, and others, willing to endure from YOUR government?   
the likelihood of them banning it, by making some decree, is far greater than the likelihood of them enforcing the ban.  significant enforcement would require an astonishing amount of network surveillance, prison space, court capacity.  like a whole new drug war.  because people want their own money even more than they want drugs.
such a move would certainly spawn a ton of countermeasures and privacy improvements to bitcoin. so although it would be depressing that a govt could be so corrupt and anti-liberty, i welcome the attack. bitcoin will win in the end, and tyranny will lose.

you can't transact with a piece of paper. you need hardware at some point. a piece of paper is easier to steal from also. hardware is password protected and encrypted. if you are looking for pure cold storage you aren't going to touch, then a paper wallet seed phrase, or a public/private key pair (although not recommended), is all you need. but eventually you need the internet to use bitcoin. and hardware protects you from malware by only passing signatures, not keys. whereas with your paper, you're going to enter the raw key or raw seed phrase on an internet-connected computer. so there's risk.

i agree however there's no need for retail to accept crypto unless it becomes so ubiquitous that retail must accept it to compete in the market.  
contrary to noob belief, crypto doesn't actually need retail adoption to change the world. not right away anyway.  
crypto can continue to build it's use as a hedge against the obviously doomed fiat system.  and of course as the only open, censorship resistant value storage and payment network available.

their fees tier down to zero for whales trading 50M per year, which isn't actually as much as it sounds if you are an active trader. you can easily do that with $100k balance in a year.  and 1M volume is pretty easy for anyone with $10-50k usd, which puts you at a .08% tier.

self-ownership "doesn't really work"? haha 
first, more people are holding (that's why the price went up), so you aren't necessarily rich. you'll sell some for sure.  
also, you can be kidnapped for cash, jewelry, and other valuables now. it happens in brazil, and other places many times per day. defend yourself, secure your valuables, and have proper security routines.  
and the banks are stealing from you as we speak. you think just because it's slowly over time, that you don't have to defend against it. socialized losses might be smaller in the short term, but everyone pays, unless you're running the show.   
you can be forced into a socialized system, where everyone loses, where everyone is the lowest common denominator, or you can choose to take responsibility for your stuff, grow some balls, get some self-defense skills (it comes in all forms), be a self-determining, self-reasoning human.

welcome to 2012. yes, basically every mobile wallet does this, and many desktop wallets do. all hardware wallets do also.  know as light wallets, or spv wallets, and other variations. you can also run a pruned full node.

linking addresses together has nothing to do with the way you connect to the internet. they're linked if they're linked on the blockchain.  your own wallet's design, and the way you utilize your wallet will determine the extent to which your transactions and addresses become linked on the blockchain.
however, from a data analytics and identity standpoint, you are linking your transactions to your ip address if you don't (carefully and properly) use a tor native wallet, or are able to firewall your wallet through a tor proxy.  
an even bigger privacy leak occurs typically when you buy your bitcoin, and those addresses are permanently linked directly to your identity. a tor wallet won't delete the permanent trail those coins follow forever into the future.  while nobody can perhaps prove those are your coins after they move, some statistical probabilities can be utilized to target you for investigation, and used as evidence at least. i'm assuming the exchange where you purchased your bitcoin has leaked the data, either legally or accidentally.

paper is easy to read. a trezor is encrypted. so yes it's more secure in that way.  it's also more secure in the sense that you never have to enter your private keys into an online device. a hardware wallet only passes signatures, which is proof you have the keys, without actually exposing the keys. so yes, very much more secure than writing your keys on paper for anyone to read.

death cross it literally just a timer that tells when the price hasn't gone up in a while.  to the extent that traders agree it means something (or want to pretend it means something, expecting a short-term trade opportunity), it will affect trading before, or after, or near that period. it could be a bullish trigger if the sell-off either doesn't happen, or is less than the market expects.  a weekly or monthly candle close, or a break of a trend line is just as likely to be a trigger for market action as a death cross is.   
it's not a good indicator though, especially in a growing industry. that's for sure. but in bitcoin's case, this market has been front-run so much by whales (2016-2017 especially) that we could get plenty more selling, even with continued fundamental growth. this indicator is not so much a sign that there isn't growth, but that the growth hasn't been fast enough to appease this particular population of big holders.

the blockchain doesn't store any identifying information, only addresses and amounts.  
your wallet, your exchange, your isp, your bank all store as much data as they can, including ip addresses.    
ledger, for example is not private inherently.  you have to be careful to keep it private by using it with a tor-native wallet, and never using it on clearnet.  otherwise ledger knows your ip address.

Between location costs, fraud, theft, transaction reversal risk, accounting costs, regulatory and legal risks and burdens, equipment costs, you can bet this isn't a very high margin business right now. They don't have sufficient economics of scale right now, and the up front costs and risks are substantial.   
Think about it this way: If you think it's so expensive, you're free to start one and undercut him. If you truly believed you could make a good profit doing it, then what's stopping you or anyone from doing it?  Considering there really aren't any extreme barriers to entry, anyone should be able to compete.

TA isn't meant to "work". It's just analysis. Predictions are what people add because they like the attention on social media.  The best TA can do is assign a less than 100% probability.  Everyone knows human markets are driven by human choices, and that mind reading the entire population, or predicting everyone's behavior will always be impossible.  The confidence expressed by these TA guys is just arrogance and stupidity (actually it's more like a persuasion method intended to manipulate people. that, and sometimes just plain pretentious vanity).
The best use for TA is formulating if/then statements to execute a plan.  If you have no plan, then you're equally as stupid as the overconfident TA guys.

same reason gold has. front running the fed decision yesterday, hoping for a big move. notice both gold and btc are flat to slightly down after the fed minutes. now the market needs to digest the meaning of the rate cut before the next move. continued dovishness from the fed will likely push gold, btc, and maybe even stocks up further. after all, the fed has explicitly stated they are trying to pump markets and increase debt. ecb is doing the same.

It's not the banking system that is the problem, it's the political system that has formed it, and which regulates it, and which forces people to use it.  As long as govt has control of our children's minds for the first 18 years of their lives, people will continue to embrace their own financial slavery to benefit state power, whether that is through explicit taxation or though the constitutionally illegal and hidden taxation of money printing and the anti-capitalist, anti-progress too-big-to-fail bailouts.

of course value means something. there are few objective ways to measure bitcoin's success, and value is a major one, like it or not. high value **means** people value it highly. the longer the price stays high, the more proven confidence exists. it's very fucking important. wealth is not a sin. especially wealth in pursuit of good.  making money and wanting to make money doesn't make bitcoin worse. you're just policing speech to fit your utopian vision where wealth doesn't matter and everyone gets along. ain't gonna happen. money and trade keep society civil. the alternative is to go to war over those resources. stopping discussion of one of the few things humanity has in common is ill-advised to say the least.

mining difficulty has absolutely nothing to do with the deflationary nature of bitcoin. deflationary simply means fixed supply. related terms you should research are "sound money" and  "monetary policy".  and if you want to get really advanced, try to understand "velocity of money" and "rehypothecation" and how they can have inflationary/deflationary effects.
deflation means you pay less for things, because the money is worth more.

bitcoin's place in the economy is speculative. so is the price. until it's not.    
also you have to realize the inherent stability that comes with being a unit of account, and having higher liquidity.  
further, fiat is stable partially because of the way it's programmed to lose value over time. so it's "stable" in its slow decline in purchasing power.

...  


tokens in circulation will always equate to the dollars in its bank account.” This claim enabled Bitfinex and Tether to signal to the market that there was rapidly growing  demand  for
cryptocurrencies  because  each  USDT  printed  represented another U.S. dollar invested into the market.  
1.4 trillion in damages is complete BS of course.  I guess the plaintiffs just want to get Tether forced into discovery to publicize the extent of their fractional reserve scheme.  A scheme, by the way, that every major exchange is similarly perpetrating.    The unique thing about the tether situation is the way the printed tethers were publicized by design, whereas the other exchanges can keep their money printing hidden.  If they were honest, this is obviously a good signal for the market; But if they are lying, then outrage is deserved for the manipulative power being used.  Discovery is the goal here. 1.4 trillion doesn't even exist in net wealth of every crypto player on earth.

If LN is the same as banking, then why would anyone use it?   The truth is LN can't be censored like banking.  
And fees will adjust to whatever the miners need to operate. If miners don't make enough, they are free to quit and let the difficulty adjust.  
LN is so we don't have to raise the block size right away (not to replace on chain tx). If bitcoin grows (as it is expected to do), then there is no reason to believe the current block size won't be full with transactions (and fees), even if just from opening and closing LN channels (as if LN will be around for long, or stay dominant).

such a clamp-down would be a clear sign of panic, and the absolute best advertisement for bitcoin.   
they won't win. there is no way that every nation state in the world tries to shut down bitcoin, and short of that, bitcoin will continue to flourish and spread. and those countries who refuse to ban bitcoin will see in influx of wealth from the countries that tried to ban it. regulatory arbitrage is real, and creates a system of competition between governments. 
if and when a nation state tries to ban it, the only question is how much misery people will accept from their government before they stand up against it.  "by the people, and for the people" they say. remember that?

you can look at the order books. they're public. but the order book is not going to show you the true market depth because traders have bots which trigger orders which are hidden from the order books. and that's not to mention traders who are waiting for certain prices to manually enter their orders.  also plenty of orders are placed which are intended to look like orders, but will be pulled if the price gets too close. so it's hard to tell what's really going on.

Absolutely not. When the costs of making a product goes up, that doesn't necessarily mean the price for that product goes up "to fill the profit gap". It could mean that producers margins go down. Value is subjective, whether that's the value of a bitcoin itself, or value of a bitcoin transaction in the form of fees. Users aren't merely passive participants in the market, blindly accepting whatever price is told to them. That's not how markets work.

they could try, but it would cause a fork as soon as the censored chain diverged from the inclusive chain.  then all the consensus stakeholders (exchanges, users, retailers, nodes, devs, etc...) would decide which chain they want to follow, and which one they recognize as the real bitcoin. perhaps a large chunk of stakeholders would prefer the censored chain for whatever reason. the market would decide what their coin was worth, and if they would accept it for payment or otherwise. but the more inclusive chain is very much most likely to be considered the real bitcoin. the fork would be called something else, and exchanges would have to decide whether to list it or not.

you can't prove it to their satisfaction. their job is to determine the facts about the trade they were paid to enable and insure.  your concern is about a different transaction entirely. one in which they were not involved, and have no jurisdiction to involve themselves in.  if they allowed you to post about it, they would open themselves to legal action from the accused.

short answer yes, sort-of.  
however, presumably not all your wealth is at one address. wallets store many addresses, and better wallets manage those addresses in such a way as to minimize this sort of privacy concern.  there are also additional features for advanced users like coin control, and mixing to further mitigate. there are actually many ways to ensure privacy.

There are a few options, but either way you need to slow down and be sure you know what you're doing. It's easy to fuck this up or get scammed.    
1. there is a wallet called "wasabi" which has built-in coin mixing. it's fairly new, so....
2.  if you're using a darknetmaket, and you're using a (relatively!) reputable one, then they will likely suggest a mixing service on their wallet page after you open your account. this is shady of course.  
3. you can convert your bitcoin to monero. there is a site that allows this anonymously i forget the name. then you can either use or hold the monero, or you can convert it back to bitcoin using an anoymous service, assuming one exists. can't remember the details... anyone?  
remember though mixing isn't a perfect solution in the sense that seller that sold you the bitcoin will be able to see that you are likely using a mixing service.

it's not paranoia. it's personal responsibility.  with financial sovereignty comes financial responsibility. of course, you can still decide to hold your bitcoin with responsible custodians, and let them worry about it just like any other financial instrument. but with bitcoin, now you have the option to take control of your asset like no other asset in history. and with that freedom and control, comes serious responsibility, since there is no ceo of bitcoin to petition for a reimbursement, and no socialized taxpayer program to bail you out. that is, not unless you pay for the additional opt-in service via a custodian or insurance of some sort.

yes, you should test your seed before you depend on it to save you.  every wallet has a "restore wallet from seed" function, or the like.  
also, your title is not the right question. you don't have a single private key. you have a massive list of private keys derived from your seed phrase. your seed is your private key set.

who will sell to them? and at what price? they would have to make us all rich first. and of course as soon as the first person figures out what they're doing, the price skyrockets, and people start holding it instead of selling it to them. if they manage to get all the bitcoin, that simply proves that nobody really wants it in the first place. so they make us all rich, then bitcoin is worthless because they have it all and now nobody wants it. so now we've moved on to another fork of bitcoin, and they start all over again trying to buy it?

Estimate a probability or confidence level that the price will be lower in 3 months.  Then determine how much free capital you have to spend for that 3 months.  If you are 30% confident the price will be lower in 3 months, then set aside 30% of your 3 month capital for that time, and do a weekly DCA with the rest between then. Don't stray from your plan unless something changes in the fundamental assumptions of your estimate.

it's not a bad idea at all. you pay the higher fee to ensure you don't miss the price.    the difference is usually only 0.2%.  on the downside, you also increase your likelihood of slippage (when the market isn't deep enough to fill your market order at the current market price), so limit orders can be good to avoid this.

There will only every be ~21million bitcoin. and bitcoin can be subdivided practically infinitely, so there there will always be enough units for everyone to have lots, whether those are nominal bitcoin, millibits, satoshis, whatever arbitrary unit you want or need to contrive by dividing bitcoin less or more.  
The point being for Berkshire Hathaway for example, you need the full share price of $312,000 to own any of it. But with bitcoin, you can own a tiny fraction if you want.

If your wallet is not open source, those are not your coins. Stay away from atomic wallet, or other closed source wallets, unless you want to trust their devs as defacto custodian. In which case you might as well leave your coins on coinbase or wherever.

wrong question. the real question is "why not bitcoin?" liquidity is king until someone proves they solve an actual problem that needs to be solved. "more secure" is absolute bullshit. and speed surely comes with severe trade-offs in centralization, immutability, security, etc...you can't short-cut proof-of-work.   
they will continue to try though, and then they try to sell it as "new and improved!". sorry, but you've been had.  a software tweek by a competitor isn't going to kill bitcoin. if someone finds an obviously better way, bitcoin can adopt it, or fork if it doesn't.

You're completely wrong. Until bitcoin becomes a unit of account, then price is everything. And "shutting the absolute fuck up about price" won't change that.  Stop pretending this isn't about wealth accumulation. That's what money is.  
Bitcoin was started with a thesis. Proof is in the price. The price signals to the world that the thesis was correct. Smart money tells the truth.

fyi: 
A transactoin never stops being confirmed. The number of confirmations you require to consider the payment "paid" is an individual choice. The industry standard for a highly secure, and therefore practically irreversible, transaction is 6 confirmations. But after 3 or 4, the odds of reversal are incredibly small.

When you're brought up believing we need a violent coercive state power to "stabilize" markets, you'll believe that free markets, because they fluctuate freely, are somehow "manipulated", as if that somehow is bad. Of course they must forget that their "stable" markets are propped up by a guaranteed devaluation of their currency over time. That's the price of this fake stability, of this security theater.

slippery slope fallacy. systems are far more complex than that. nobody wants to buy too high, and everyone expects a pullback at some point.  the real question you're asking is if central banks will adopt a major position in bitcoin. if they do, they surely won't announce it, and they'll use all their power to talk the price down while they buy.  the best strategy is to start some serious FUD campaigning to get people to dump, and then secretly buy in the OTC markets, sort of like what institutions had done during 2018 to cause this rally now. but rest assured, govts and institutions have many ways to talk you out of your bitcoin.

no way to prove ownership of btc really. you can prove you have the keys, or that you have control of someone with the keys. that's it.  the reserves have more to do with the claims of ownership of those keys, which is technically different from a legal standpoint than simple or temporal custody. your dream is impossible. we can only take custody ourselves to make sure they are liquid. you can only prove ownership of your own keys to yourself.

The paper supply of bitcoin is going to get much bigger before people realize they can take custody. Every time a new exchange opens, they have the opportunity to run a fraction reserve (they will take advantage wherever they can). Similarly when bitcoin ETFs or whatever are created.  The fake supply of bitcoin has a long way to go before it plateaus. I hope the public starts to learn about true custody soon. Probably it will take some more pain, and lots of time before the real potential of bitcoin is realized.

i suggest you use a hardware wallet which you can pair with your mobile wallet on any phone. this removes the major vulnerability of storing keys on your phone, even though the keys are encrypted.  the problem with storing your bitcoin on an internet-connected device is that malware like keyloggers can steal your encryption password. that can't happen with a hardware wallet since it only passes signatures, not keys.

"worth it" in what sense? obtaining your own private collection of potentially anonymous bitcoin has varying value to different people. do you need bitcoin? or are you merely looking at profiting from market prices? if the latter is true, a used miner won't likely make you a profit unless your miner is not very old, and your other costs are nil to little.

bitcoin is "used" as a store of value, among other things. storing bitcoin decreases available supply on exchanges. all else being equal, a reduction in supply tends to increase value per unit.  so your thesis lacks logical coherence. unless you can elaborate? "less bitcoin being used" doesn't mean less use of the bitcoin network, especially when the value/unit is increasing. you need less bitcoin to do the same as before. this "hording" fear comes from central bank propaganda. no economy ever suffered catastrophe as a result of too much savings.

If they have a monopoly (which I doubt, where are you?), it's only because they are being subsidized by the state. State sponsored monopoly is what you should be fighting. And you don't do that with even more state sponsorship via regulatory welfare that has unintended consequences and only favors the rich guys sponsoring the bill.

Merchants will want to use bitcoin to avoid chargebacks (something these ewallets can't do).  Merchant's costs are reduced by this, and so prices can be lowered. Some merchants do already offer bitcoin discounts because of this obvious benefit.  Bitcoin wallet makers have little incentive to offer give-aways considering the cross-compatibility between wallets, and the non-custodial nature of bitcoin wallets.

a "wallet" isn't where you sign up. an exchange is where you sign up. a wallet is where you store your bitcoin, and it's private, otherwise it's not a wallet, it's a service.  
most exchanges require id.  there are some p2p exchanges like paxful, and bisq, mycelium localtrader (used to be a thing anyway) where you might find sellers who wont require id.  also, i believe bitquick.co allows small purchases without id, last i knew.  otherwise, you can try finding a local bitcoin meetup group, or find someone on craigslist, or look for a local bitcoin atm which may or may not require id.  
or you can suck it up, show your id and open an exchange account. then worry about anonymizing your bitcoin afterward.

You can, but nobody with a brain sells bitcoin for paypal, since it is literally the easiest payment method to reverse. Coinbase recently enabled withdrawals via paypal, but they're smart enough not to take deposits. If you find it (look at localbitcoins, paxful), you will pay a substantial premium for the risk, and you'll potentially deal with some shady sellers, which of course is always the case when you use a peer to peer platform like that. Good luck.

Decentralization is used by bitcoin to create immutability and security. Centralized exchanges are reliable enough for most people. If a decentralized exchange can be developed that has some of the features and scale of the centralized ones, then they might get more attention, but buying bitcoin doesn't need decentralization as badly as bitcoin's network security needs it.  Decentralization has its uses, but it's not for everything.

the most cost-efficient way to buy is using wire transfers and limit orders on an exchange with free limit orders, and to deposit at least $6-10K worth at a time. you don't have to spend it all at once, but a large deposit is the key to reducing the percent cost.

people do it. i wouldn't, especially if you aren't well informed about encryption methods.  and every time you go to access the seed, you are putting your keys at risk, unless, again you have a very careful and well-informed method.  bottom line, it adds lots of attack vectors that need to be considered.    
if your reason for doing it is to be able to access your seed from a variety of computers, then your reasoning is flawed from the start.  you should use a controlled environment (not connected to the internet, and clean of malware) when encrypting/decrypting.  
for most people, it's a bad idea.

Just means the bitcoin market and price discovery mechanism are maturing.    
Bakkt's bitcoin-settled futures product is particularly of interest because it is less able to create short-term "manipulations" of bitcoin's spot price on exchanges.  This is because bets placed on bitcoin which don't involve trading actual bitcoin can be much larger than the relatively small bitcoin market overall can handle in terms of liquidity on exchanges.  So because bitcoin is a small market compared to other legacy markets, and compared to the wealth held by top global investors, this means bitcoin's spot exchange price can be "manipulated" short term by placing large bets in the cash-settled futures, and derivative markets, and only needing to place a relatively small trade on a major bitcoin exchange to temporarily move the price a large enough amount to make huge profits on their derivative trade (since derivative market contracts are based on bitcoin spot price).      
The unfortunate catch is that powerful legacy traders actually like to be able to manipulate in this way, so they have no interest in bitcoin-settled futures.  That's why it's good to see the bitcoin-settled futures increasing in volume.  Really though, Bakkt's bitcoin-settled futures product should just be seen as another bitcoin exchange in terms of its "influence".   
  Ideally what we want to see is the liquidity in bitcoin-settled futures, and the liquidity in spot bitcoin exchange grow to counter-act the manipulative power the derivatives market currently has.    
It's growing pains of an immature market, and immature price discovery mechanism.

He's also the only guy who called the 2008 crisis, and the only guy who called the early end to the fed taper. Gold just broke over a 6 year level, and he never goes around saying he's absolutely sure about when gold is going to move (that's what bitcoin fanatics do). He just knows the macro trends meaning that gold is due for rally. He's right. And those who play the long game with him will do just fine. Bitcoin is  peanuts compared to gold, and you're acting as if some short term price spike is proof of bitcoin's superiority. It's nonsense.

It's legal to use (almost) everywhere in the world. No US states have banned it.  The Islamic and authoritarian socialist states tend to be against it.  There are few outright bans though.

institutions are generally low time preference. institutional fomo is kind of an oxymoron. institutions buy OTC, which causes shortages on the retail markets after the fact. i suspect that's sort of what we've been seeing for the last month, a liquidity squeeze from all the otc buying that was happening below 6k.  
so now the question is: if you bought below 6k, where are you selling? 12k will be 2x at least.  starts to look juicy for investors.  and surely you want to sell on the retail market if you are a whale and intend to cause a panic for a quick rebuy.  if you're into that sort of thing.  the more newbs into the space, the easier it is to cause a panic.   
has the market learned from the past, that bitcoin is here to stay? we'll see.

It's being built.  We're awake. Welcome to the party as it seems you've just awakened yourself.
Government NEVER leads innovation. It always follows after it becomes politically expedient.  Of course, nobody knows how many people will be subjected to their oppression, fines, kidnapping and murder in the meantime.   
Rich people aren't the enemy. Government is.  As long as government is seen as an unbounded source of power and money, corruption will dominate within government. The only fix ultimately is to throw that ring of power in the fire.  In the meantime, decentralized finance can help choke them of some financing, with any luck (and lots of will).  
And the sad truth is you can lead the collective horse to water, but you can't make him drink unless you have nuclear weapons and tanks.

Maybe it's a bad design. Maybe he'll get more rich than he deserves. But how is it a scam?   Personally I prefer more people think it's a scam because that means I'll get more of the supply if you don't claim.  I just really want to hear someone point out the fraud. There is none afaik. Educate me.

"Hodl" is just what people say in public. It's a politically correct marketing strategy because new investors want to think people aren't going to dump on them. It's also a way of promoting long-term strategies, which in general are more wise.  That's not to say anyone really knows what the future of bitcoin, in particular, looks like. The truth is nobody knows, and this sort of uncertainty means volatility is normal and expected, making a hold strategy less than optimal for real-life people, who have short term financial needs, and who often say one thing, but do another. HODL is a form of virtue signalling.   The people chanting "hodl" are more likely trying to convince themselves because they are weak and short-sighted.

if bitcoin price dropped to $500 tomorrow, there's a reason for it. and likely it's because bitcoin is already dead for some reason.  the rest of the story is moot.  it would never happen like you describe.   
 you also of course left out the fee part of the equation, and the fact that miners often run at a loss if they expect the price to recover.   so not only does the price need to drop, it needs to stay low for a long time.
PS.  
bitcoin was $500 a few years ago, and the network was fine.

Look up the transaction using the transaction id, on a block explorer, like blockchain.info, or the like.  Look to see how many sat/byte you submitted for the miner fee.     
If you paid more than 2 sat/byte, your transaction will likely clear by the end of next weekend or sooner.

Fresh meat. Sign up for any exchange you want. Coinbase is huge and nosey, and loves to close people's accounts for sending Bitcoin to questionable services or addresses, but a lot of people use them. Coinbase allows you to transfer money via ACH, which is free, from you bank account. Where other exchanges usually require you to wire the money, which costs probably $10-30 per transaction.  No matter which exchange you choose, get ready to give up your personal information. If you are privacy conscious, you can avoid giving personal information by purchasing on a peer-to-peer exchange like localbitcoins.com, or bitquick.co, or paxful, where you can purchase smaller amounts without having to give up your info, but you'll pay a 5-25% premium for this method in which you can deposit cash directly into someone's bank account in a branch local to you; The website arranges the transaction and escrow, and you get your Bitcoin once the deposit is confirmed.  For a desktop computer, get a wallet like electrum, and don't lose your seed.

you're paying more than you need to.

Depends how much and how often you're buying. The professional exchanges have lower fees but you will likely need to wire transfer the money from your bank account, which costs $10-40 depending on your bank. So if you're buying more than, say, 1 bitcoin, then a pro exchange is definitely the best choice. Coinbase has their GDAX division, there's also itbit, gemini... others... You want a high volume exchange, and one of the popular ones.

@_date: 2019-12-12 19:49:44
those companies are already under national rule. so how do they proceed in fucking "us" without fucking themselves too?  and how is that not the end of their involvement in bitcoin if they find a way to fuck us?  even 90% of hash power can't censor transactions, they can only delay them. if they try to rewrite the chain, they get forked off the network. the most they can do is fuck themselves and cause a temporary disruption. if bitcion becomes "too big", then the chinese stake in bitcoin's success is equally as big.   
as if this 60% number is even real. mining pools don't actually "control" all the miners in the pool. it's trivial to switch pools.  so not only do mining pool operators *not* control all of their miners, but miners don't control bitcoin. the consensus mechanism does, and that is far more decentralized than if you just look at mining pool operators.  didn't we learn that in the last couple take over attempts?

Bitcoin cash is a separate chain, a different coin, with little liquidity, and a shitty little dev team.  It's a minority fork that is basically a failure, but persists anyway.  Bitcoin core, is one implementation of bitcoin node software: One of many in a flourishing majority chain with tons of liquidity and tons of devs.  Bitcoin core works for bitcoin. Bitcoin cash is a shitcoin. It's really bitcoin vs. bitcoin cash that you should be asking about, because bitcoin core isn't a coin (it's a software implementation), and bitcoin cash is a coin.

buy from any exchange you want. the price differences fluctuate, because every trade is a voluntary agreement between a buyer and a seller. you're not buying from the exchange really; you're buying from one of the many traders that have an exchange account. and each one of then have a different selling price for their bitcoin.  just because you see a $100 difference now, doesn't mean 2 seconds from now it will be the same. if there is a particular price you want to buy at, then open an account on a very active exchange, where many traders fill many orders.  enter a limit order for the price you like, and hope that someone wants to sell for that price at some point.

You can use any exchange you want for that. I'm not going to promote mine, but a few good ones if you want to stick to US based companies is itBit, Gemini. Others to consider Bitstamp, Kraken, BTC-e, Bitmex. If you want to open up your bank account to the public, you can get higher premium selling on Localbitcoins, Bitquick.co, Paxful... I'm forgetting a few. But each exchange has it's own quirks, which are good to consider. itBit for example does withdrawals in few daily batches, and not on the weekends or holidays, which can be annoying.

The act of "looking" at something is presumed to be a process of looking around that thing to find the edges; And so inferred is a critical assessment of the visual space.

Otherwise, the fool would be more likely even, than for example a critical thinker, to follow the commands of a leader.

bitcoin is scarce, but crypto isn't (although bitcoin is synonymous with crypto for most people, and for good reason).  and i'm not convinced by arguments that higher price brings stability necessarily, at least not the kind of "stability" you see in the manipulated currencies that are programmed to fall slowly in value.
i suspect the stability aspect will have more to do with bitcoin finding its niche in the economy, rather than merely having a higher value. it really depends on how stable bitcoin's place in the economy is; and then bitcoin is as stable as any economy naturally would be without a central bank pulling the strings, directly anyway.  
freedom can be messy, and people are used to the security theater of centrally controlled protection racket.

Anyone can track the bitcoin after that. Anyone doesn't know the identity of the person who made the transaction however, unless they were involved in the transaction, or obtained information from the people involved in the transaction. Coinbase only knows the identity of the person for that specific transaction, and presumably the transaction that follows, since they know you took possession from them, and therefore the next transaction must be yours. They use chain analysis techniques to figure out probabilities that you were involved in a nefarious transaction, and may cancel your account if they suspect something.  
For legal defense, plausable deniability may be enough, but with bitcoin exchanges, they may cancel your account for any reason, even if it's just a suspicion. And suspicions may be enough for law enforcement to investigate you further.  
It's critical to understand that the bitcoin blockchain doesn't contain any of your private information, but everyone you do business with, using bitcoin, is collecting some data and associating it to that bitcoin transaction in their own files.

There's no such thing as a world without computers. A computer is in essence an object which computes. A person computes. Further, there are an infinite number of tools capable of assisting calculation, which fall short of what very specific definition it appears you must be using, but which can expedite the task.  The difficulty would adjust. Your scenario is bound by a set of inflexible definitions to a ridiculously radical set of conditions which appear to negate the very concept of digital communication all together, and therefore the need for bitcoin itself. Apologize you should. 0 for 2 my friend. It's as if you smoked the bong, said "hey what if there were no computers?" And rather than think this through entirely, you just hit record."

First, it's important to undestand that it's possible "Bitcoin" could fail, while crypto currency succeeds (I know fanboys, gasp!). Bitcoin is just a name of a project; And that project could fail in any number of ways. A contentious fork could divide the community in such a way that the bitcoin name is left behind.  I doubt it, but it's possible.  
Further than that, crytpo currency is here to stay insofar as it represents a peer-to-peer money network. That is, unless the internet is somehow shut down by a monstrous global tyranny.  But then, there's always p2p mesh network possibilities...
The genie isn't going back in the bottle.

Trezor or Ledger Nano S are both fine. There are no serious security issues with any of them.   
 Keep in mind, if you lose your hardware wallet, it is technically in danger. But with any of them it will take many hours to steal the contents, assuming a highly technical and highly equipped professional obtains your wallet, so you have time to realize it's gone, and move the funds.
Aside from that, if you want features, like tons of memory for other crypto currencies, you'll have to pay. But if you're just looking for security, any of the popular ones are perfectly fine.

The network is not particularly backed up right now, so it shouldn't take much longer as long as you paid a reasonable fee.  You can check the status of a transaction by taking the transaction id and enter it into a block explorer like blockchain.info, or blockr.io, or blockcypher.com, or others. Wallets sometimes give you hyperlinks on the transaction id you can click and view it on an explorer.

Accept the fact that holding bitcoin requires personal responsibility.  is dumb.   
You don't get maximum ease-of-use without sacrificing direct ownership and security.   
In other words a sign up for a custodial account will be required if you want it stupid simple and somewhat safe.    
Besides, a backup seed is easier than an account sign-up. So start there. Any popular open source wallet will do. If it's not popular, then it's not well tested; and if it's not open source, then you don't control your coins.
You don't want to bank your business success on the performance on a single wallet provider.

Ports are open and closed on your router. Each router is different, but there is a table that shows the the ip address of any computers/devices that have ports open. It's specific to ip address, so if you reinstalled OS, or changed hardware, then the ip may have changed.  
It is possible/likely that your router uses dynamic ip address assignments for devices attached to it.  So you may also have to find another page in your router settings that allows you to set that ip to "static ip address", so the router doesn't try to change the ip address for that device, causing you to lose the open port again.

Yes, OTC trades are normal. "Impact on price" is simply a way of describing the current state of the public (non-OTC) order book (just because current orders are being sold on the open exchange for a certain price, doesn't mean you have to pay that price). Trades completed OTC are effectively a seperate order book; one you can't see until itBit releases their OTC totals later. If you have 100 BTC to trade, you can look for an OTC trade and possibly get a better rate than what the current order book offers.

your btc funds aren't actually located on your phone, or on your ledger. your mycelium wallet (if linked properly) has access to your ledger public keys, so it can see your balances.  and your ledger can pass a signature through your mycelium to transmit a transaction without the ledger actually giving away the private keys.  that's the magic of a hardware wallet.  your funds aren't "located" anywhere. your private keys give you access to your funds, and those keys remain secure on your ledger, even when you "link" to another wallet, assuming you've done it properly.  the ledger site has plenty of literature on this subject.
edit: Regarding the "2 seeds", mycelium introduces their concept of "accounts" which is really another word for wallet. I believe mycelium automatically creates a default "account", which is a wallet in the normal sense. It's empty and you shouldn't need to use it, or back it up. However, if you don't know what you're doing, just back it up in case you fuck up and send funds to it.

the magic is all in the seed format.  your seed is just an input variable that is used in a formula to generate your entire list of private keys on all the chains it's designed to do so.  your seed is a finite list of private keys essentially.  the seed formats are all open source, so you could, if you choose, simply convert your seed into a text list of private keys using the code which you can find online or a feature available in some wallets.   
Yes, you could use your seed across multiple wallets, assuming they used the same format. The major wallets share the common formats. I'm not sure about this one in particular, but all the formats are open source, so you don't have to worry about a wallet company going out of business or disappearing, and losing access to your private keys. You will always be able to generate your private keys using your seed in the future. Your seed and your keys are essentially the same thing, except your seed is a compressed format for portability.

Conversion is a math problem. Trading is a financial transaction done in partnership with a Bitcoin exchange, or 3rd party seller.

This probably wouldn't happen.

You can bet the feds and intelligence services are tracking serial numbers as part of their investigations. Commercial entities are likely doing it on a very limited basis, maybe where they are cooperating with the feds on fraud cases.

FYI: What is 'M2'
M2 is a measure of the money supply that includes all elements of M1 as well as "near money." M1 includes cash and checking deposits, while near money refers to savings deposits, money market securities, mutual funds and other time deposits. These assets are less liquid than M1 and not as suitable as exchange mediums, but they can be quickly converted into cash or checking deposits.

It's block reward halving, not block halving. Don't expect anything at any certain time. You can look to see what the market did last time we had such an event. It has reacted positively around the event.  Reward halving isn't going to have near as significant an affect on price as user adoption can. There are so many other factors to affect price, and so many which are unknown, that the halving is hardly worth consideration unless you're considering starting a mining business, and we are nearer to the event.

Wallets don't charge anything technically. Miners do. Wallets estimate or calculate fees, but should also allow you to enter a manual amount (unfortunately, many don't). Proper exchanges, ones with trading platforms like GDAX, Gemini, itBit (for USA customers) have lower trading fees than those you mention. Typically you pay a flat wire transfer fee from your bank, and from the exchange. After that, the trading fees vary. Itbit for example has zero fee trades for limit orders placed below the current ask price (market maker). So, since the fees are flat basically, the higher your deposit/purchase amount, the lower the fee percentage, and the more cost efficient.

Basically. It depends how you use it. Electrum is a desktop application, and so is vulnerable to desktop type attacks. Copay is mobile. Both are open source and respected wallets, for the most part.

There is no intellectual property consideration here.  It seems like you have almost no idea what you're talking about; But you did use the term ERC20, so that's suppose to signal that you're an insider. I'm not buying it. I suggest listening and reading much more before posting complex questions that make no sense.

 "When a jerkoff, who has been smacked down by Satoshi before, telling him not to change the block size or he would be forked off to his own detriment--when I see a guy that now holds opposite all the positions he used to have--I'm talking about you Jeff Garzic--When I see that guy trying to create a fork without replay protection and trying to repeat your speech out to the world to your detriment--A guy like that has got to get censured publically, and since no one else has the balls to do it, I'm going to do it.
Jeff Garzic, stop being a bitch. Stop trying to roll out a fork without replay protection. Stop trying to pretend you have got a competent developer team there; You don't. If Greg Maxwell wasn't constantly helping you guys, all of your nodes would be banning each other constantly. You guys suck at development.

ItBit has a $10 incoming wire fee (plus your bank's wire fee probably $15-50). Then you pay for the trade (itbit has free market maker fees, some others do free trades as well). And for withdrawal, again itBit does not charge a fee (not even a miner fee). For larger amounts, this is a good method.  For smaller, I can't help you.

Depends on your bitcoin use. Paper wallets work fine for storing.  For mobile devices there are a few good ones, Mycelium, Jaxx, Greenaddress. For desktop there is Electrum. If you are at all serious though, get a hardware wallet, a Trezor or Ledger Nano S are both widely regarded as good; Hardware wallets can be integrated with the popular software wallets too, or you can use the software option that comes with the hardware wallet.

I see. Your teacher asked a dumb question IMO. But if I got that I would mention at least that Bitcoin enables new kinds of businesses to operate, and ones we haven't thought of yet.  This is because bitcoin is programmable money, and this has never existed. Aside from that I would say Bitcoin is beneficial for any kind of business that suffers high costs of credit and debit card charge-backs (many businesses in this category, especially online), or any kind of business that is being censored by corporate and retail banks, for whatever reason. Wikileaks comes to mind. Least suited businesses? I guess everything else.

You have it backwards. The macro economic implications of Keyensian redistribution is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is sound money. These are not rarely debated topics. I mean, are you suggesting there are no political or ethical principles involved here, or that they are not discussed? Economic planning is for statist thieves and murderers. Bitcoin is will not be forcefully redistributed in the name of economic theory. This is an ethical model and trumps macro economic theorizing. Since when has any person's macro economic model served to help anything other than the advancement of state power?

Best thing for you would be to see if you can go to a Bitcoin Meetup in your area, and find someone to sell them to you (or even put out a craigslist ad).

search "argument against deflationary currency". This is not a new argument. Dollars will be spent first because they lose value over time (nobody really wants them! except beurocrats). Government "inflationary" fiat (with it's inherent hidden tax) will exist until it doesn't.  No rational actor would choose it when given a choice of a currency that doesn't devalue (depending on temporal market conditions of course. One could imagine a bear market in bitcoin, and a bull market in the dollar, even during such a transition). This is not a flaw; This is a feature.

I don't know about this donkey, but traders are like odds makers. They make a lot of bets, and if they have a good edge, they win enough of them to stay in profit. Trading is more about stack management, and executing good strategy, than about being a prophet.

Even the worst traders can be profitable in bitcoin, so that's why you see so many donkey claims like this every day, especially in this sub.

Seems he only makes an actual argument for Ethereum, talking about how ICO development is overshadowing core eth development due to ICO incentives. So? ICOs are a bubble. Market incentives to work on core development are fine. There is a ton of diverse business interest in bitcoin's success. Business interest is not the opposite of decentralization, contrary to what many would claim. Government interest should be suspect, but not business interest so much. Monopolies don't last in the free market, and especially don't stand a chance in bitcoin.

Is your only objection to use of the term "market cap" the "distinction between publicly or total available coins"? And that a coin isn't a stock?   
If so, this is a pretty weak argument.  There are similar distinctions in stocks which are limited in availability to to certain groups of people.  Nobody says market cap is in any way a real or attainable purchasing power.  It's just a metric used to compare like things, and to make relative comparisons.  If you're worried about investors believing it means something that it doesn't, you should be even more concerned about investors in the stock market who think stock's market cap means something.  Who trades purely on market cap? without investigating the underlying asset? Idiots? They will lose no matter what. It's better they don't have the power that lots of money can bring.

The exact attack he mentions isn't clear. It seems to me you would calculate the cost of the attack by how many confirmations you need to "fake".  The more confirmations, the more impossible it is to fake the transaction. There are many variables and game theoreticals, and countermeasures available, in such an attack. There's a multi billion dollar honeypot sitting here waiting for someone to try it. So far, so good.

Free market solutions are not subject to Tragedy of the Commons. Price discovery is the difference between government's price-fixing (commons) and free market activity. Price discovery only happens in free markets when people use their capital (capital being that which people objectively value) to prove the value of things. Whereas the government attempt to dictate ideological values on a population via "the Commons".   
Max Keiser once said "price discovery technology happens", or something. In The Tragedy of the Commons, the price discovery technology is a destructive force (as seen in a failure to maintain, a general lack of accountability, boils down to lack of ownership) of so-called "common goods".    
TLDR: Ownership is proof you care and are accountable. Bitcoin is not a Commons in that sense.

gold exists all over the universe. supply is practically unlimited long term.  it's better to understand gold's supply as limited by mining production capacity, mining startup costs, operation costs...  
and bitcoin's supply cap is fixed to the extent that consensus participants remain incentivized to keep it that way.   i can't image how that could change, but it's not outside the realm of possibility, contrary to popular belief.

socialism works as good in europe as it works here. america is more socialist than europe from a technical standpoint. a predominance of nominal socialism isn't a predominance of economic socialism (just like a predominance of democrats doesn't equate to a predominance of democracy (to the contrary in fact)). america has a larger welfare state than any of them.  denmark and sweden are economically more free than the us. that's why they are succeeding.  their socialist programs are failing, just like they are everywhere.

every device is basically online.  
you don't store the paper wallet on it per se. you perform a wallet function called "sweeping a private key".  this will transfer the bitcoin to your wallet app on your phone.  however, because you are dealing with $50k+, I would highly recommend first purchasing a hardware wallet, like a ledger nano s, or a trezor.  It's less than $100, and will ensure your phone doesn't get hacked for $50k.  
If you don't want to pay, and you just want to sell those bitcoin for cash, you can just sweep that private key onto a mobile wallet (see my links for suggestions. i recommend electrum). But in order to sell for cash, you will want to open an exchange account (at any of [these]( exchanges). Then you immediately send the bitcoin you now have on your mobile wallet to the exchange. The exchange is where you can sell, and have the dollars sent to your bank account.  
alternatively of course, you can just hang on to the paper wallet you have, and keep it very private and secure.

i suggest skipping this paper wallet nonsense. download tails, follow all of the verification steps, run it from a dvdr, or usb, don't connect to the internet, generate a new electrum wallet (it is already installed), take note of the receiving address, and save the backup seed as your paper wallet.  this is far more secure than anything you'll be doing with this wallet generator shit.    
paper wallets are flawed in the sense that you eventually have to enter your private key address into an online computer.  if you use an hd wallet, you never have to do that.  you can create a signed transaction on an offline computer, and transfer it to an online computer. and since a signed transaction doesn't contain keys, you can't get hacked.

Pseudo-anonymous, like the internet.    
No ID required to use bitcoin.   
Dollars, on the other hand, are mostly spent on digital banking networks where personal identification is permanently attached to every transaction.  And that data is freely shared with multiple organizations, who are regularly hacked.  
Bitcoin, even with its "traceability", is a step in the right direction for digital transactions. And more improvements in privacy are coming. Lightning Network, which is part of the Bitcoin network, improves transaction privacy substantially.  Wasabi and Samurai wallets are also privacy enhancements available to everyone.    
"More traceable than fiat" is carefully worded propaganda.  This phrase is designed to placate bureaucrats, or perhaps its designed to spur privacy improvements in bitcoin. Either way, it's not exactly the whole truth.

"regular electronic USD" requires banking relationships. now do you get why tether exists and is desired?  an exchange can trade usdt/btc and other pairs without having to obtain and maintain a banking relationship. they outsource their banking relationship to tether, the company. 
also, the market determines the price of tether. it doesn't trade 1:1 most of the time. therefore perceived risk is being priced in.  
tether is almost certainly running a sort of fractional reserve. but market participants have largely heard those stories, and price it accordingly. i think they are pricing the risk too low personally, which is why i don't buy tether.  it's almost always too expensive. if it dropped to 90% dollar value, that's another story.

i did notice they changed their "confirm delivery" process a bit, which rarely makes me have to contact support to release escrow, because the "confirm delivery" button is inactive. but support always responds within a couple hours.

Miners aren't centralized. Nobody can force them *all* to do anything. And nothing short of 100% compliance could be effective in censoring transacations.  Their most effective strategy would be to create a new fork of bitcoin with centralized censorship available (which is essentially, if accidentally, what bcash has done). See how that goes.  
Further, pool operators aren't in control of all the miners. Miners can go to any pool they want, or not use a pool, or create their own pool.    
So not only do miners not control bitcoin, as we've learned from their previous failed attempts at control, but mining pool operators don't control miners.   
The Bitcoin consensus mechanism controls bitcoin, and its control is shared by all the bitcoin stakeholders.

volatility is a function of market size (liquidity) and uncertainty regarding bitcoin's future place in the economy. bitcoin is new. bitcoin is disruptive. bitcoin has a long way to go.   
you can keep holding dollars, which are guaranteed to lose value over time via various forms of inflation and money printing, or you can hold bitcoin, whose supply cannot be increased arbitrarily.  
and further, if you zoom out far enough, the price direction for bitcoin only goes up. the dollar only goes one way over time: down.

tails is unnecessary, but should work with the right tweaks. another option for the paranoid is whonix, which runs on virtual machines.  
 you don't have to run a full node. you can easily operate a  private wallet using tails, or whonix, or even a native tor wallet (as long as you trust it).   
 you can use samurai or wasabi wallets for mixing.  
also, if you want to run a full node, no you don't need to keep your node running.  the only major caveat is that you need to keep your node up to date in order to transact with your bitcoin.  so if it gets behind, you'll just have to wait for the initial download to catch up. depending on your hardware, it could take anywhere from seconds to many hours or even days to update depending how far behind your are.

Bitcoin will fade into obscurity to whatever extent human desire for freedom also fades.  
Or...  
 if an unforeseen technology surpasses bitcoin in its ability to provide effective and efficient censorship resistant token exchange. The tech would have to take all of bitcoin's market share obviously. Bitcoin governance and consensus infrastructure would have to be unresponsive (for whatever reason) to the competing upgrades. The new tech would also have to maintain its technological dominance and edge, or risk having to deal with a resurrected bitcoin. I don't see it, but what do I know?  It's possible. And if it happens, I'll use that network.

math doesn't determine the value of the dollar.  
 economics is not hard science. value is ultimately subjective.   
and the oversupply of money can take a long time to show up in, for example, consumer prices.

you're basically right, though the output of a hardware wallet is easy to verify before sending the transaction  (for example, you can easily check if it is sending to the wrong address before sending). the internal components (and software) are also not impossibly hard to verify, if you know a little something about electronics and computers.  
further, most of the software that interacts with the hardware wallet (and acts as a firewall) is actually open source.   
if you are technically proficient, then something like the glacier protocol, using your own trusted hardware is probably better.  also take a look at coldcard.

who said it was made up?   
it is not known whether sha256 hashing can be broken by quantum ever. however, if both sha256 and ecdsa are broken by quantum, then you will have to move to a new type of address or be at risk.  it's a long way from now either way.  govt actors who have quantum abilities will keep it secret, and not waste it on a few billion dollars they can get from stealing bitcoin.  once we figure out they have the capabilities, the value goes to near-zero temporarily (rendering their loot worthless), and we fork to reverse their theft. it would be a mess, but bitcoin would survive.    
in the meantime, the best thing you can do is avoid reusing addresses, which would expose your private key if ecdsa is ever broken.

keep in mind you are bypassing all of the security offered by using a hardware wallet.  
don't do this lightly.  its really for emergencies.   the security of the machine you're using is critical.    
ideally, you should restore the seed on an offline machine, and use a wallet that allows you to export the signed transaction (if the trezor apps don't allow it, there are other wallet that will accept a trezor seed, im sure).  then you can copy that signed transaction file over to an online machine (which also has an the same wallet software that will import the signed transaction file) without exposing your seed online.  then you should wipe the offline machine so none of that data can be recovered.

downside is it is not as convenient as a hardware wallet. and your security is a bit more dependent on you keeping your machine secure, and making sure not to fuck up.  for example, you can infect your machine using the usb device with which you transfer the signed transaction from your offline machine to your online one.

A vote against bitcoin is a vote against crypto, as most people realize the alt coin market is just chasing dreams, and that if bitcoin fails, that's because the idea of crypto is failing.   
Also, have you every watched stock prices? They follow the overall market too, to one degree or another.  It's how markets work.  It's how bots are programmed.
Large drops happen because of selling.  It occurs all at once sometimes because, among other reasons, a consolidation pattern has broken, meaning many stop loss orders were triggered, causing a cascading effect.

depends on what central banks do, and how the market reacts to it, that is, if you're asking about the future price of bitcoin as expressed in dollars or fiat.

1. buy bitcoin, ideally using a cash deposit method on something like bisq.  if it is less than $300, you can also buy using cash deposit without using an ID on bitquick.co (not com).    
2. have the bitcoin deposited into a wasabi wallet you downloaded
3. mix it with wasabi wallet, sending output to your *not* illegal service, or more likely you'll need to send first to another tor-native wallet, and then to your service, making sure the left over bitcoin amount stays sequestered in your tor-native wallet, and never tied to your ID.  
there are other methods and variations to this method. this method is specific for those trying to avoid tracking by state-level actors.  if you are only trying to send it so the receiver doesn't know where it came from, its is much easier to achieve this using samurai's coin control feature for example. you buy exactly the amount you need, and use coin control to send all of that to your anonymous service.  those addresses will never be tied to your other coins. it's as if you used a throw away wallet.  which is another option. you can just use a separate, preferably tor-native, wallet, and delete the wallet when you're done with it.

if you use a paper wallet, you eventually have to enter a private key into an online computer. that is not secure.    
rather than a "paper wallet", just generate an hd deterministic wallet using an offline computer. save your backup seed on paper (just like a paper wallet) that way you don't expose your private keys.  you can generate transactions using an offline computer, and copy the signed transaction (which doesn't contain private keys) to an online computer.

despite the additional complexities of selling for fiat, and tracking tax basis, i still recommend btcpay server over any of the other solutions.  the pain is worth it. and if the merchant isn't willing to bear the pain, then he isn't ready for bitcoin.  once he starts losing customers because he doesn't accept bitcoin, that's when he's motivated to do whatever it takes.

they are religious fanatics who worship what they see as "satoshi's original vision". bcash was their realization of that vision.  so they believe they are the true bitcoin, despite satoshi's own consensus mechanism (and the market btw) saying very clearly otherwise.  
most of them are noobs who don't know shit, and are easily manipulated by roger ver's or craig wright's talking points. or they're gambling on a long shot in hopes they get a 100x at some point if the bitcoin project fails because of the block size. it's dumb really, but most people are dumb, and they have to buy something dumb. so bcash fits the bill.

financial sovereignty yes. the rest of your scenario, i dunno. weapons of war are controlled by government armies, not only by restrictions on moving fiat. the best you can do with bitcoin is take down a monetary regime. and if doing that can weaken their tyrannical tools, then bitcoin has done some good.   
bitcoin's best utility against government tyranny is its confiscation resistance, and immutability.  but that alone won't win a war.  it may help starve a gang of thieves of some of their sources of funds, particularly their ability to gather wealth by printing money. because bitcoin can take some of that wealth off the table.

You can beg, but you have no real recourse or rights here. It could have been someone to whom you sent the bitcoins that paid a gambling site. It doesn't matter. If you want to decide where your money goes, you have to hold the keys, and stop dealing with coinbase. Open an account with a more professional exchange, and don't use your exchange wallet to pay people. Use a hardware wallet, and use it through TOR. And exchange can still shut you down, but there is a less compelling case for an exchange to *worry* that you are paying *unsavory* sites.

Forks by definition, are always good for at least one group of people, and bad for another. But this analysis fails to acknowledge both the known and unknown damage to the entire system done by splitting. I'm actually pro fork, but I know it's a massive risk for short and medium term financial positions in the project. A financial reset in the crypto markets is fine with me because I know I'll see it coming and can prepare accordingly.

Stop trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Bitcoin may always be volatile. Nobody knows if volatility will decrease, even though most here will claim to have an opinion about it. Bitcoin will never be regular normal currency. Never.

Bitcoin allows transactions which are not allowed under collective or authoritarian states. Bitcoin is peer to peer transactions and sound money. That's it.

Not secure by any sort of community or industry standards. Not even close. Single factor authentication is a massive vulnerability no matter what OS you use.  Learn how to use multisig. For an example of 2-of-2 multisig, you can use TAILS for your darknet purchases (assuming you know the risks and limits in general). Use persistence to save your wallet in TAILS for signing the first signature of the 2-of-2. You can then sign the second signature running WHONIX on your main pc (preferably a linux machine you trust). I mean I'm assuming you want to keep behind TOR when you transmit on the Bitcoin network. If you don't care about TOR, then you can still use TAILs to sign the first signature, and use your regular desktop/laptop, or whatever to sign the second signature. This combo is just as safe as any decent 2-factor setup.

It doesn't have "a value". It's value is symbolically represented by transient exchange rates between free acting individuals. There is no price.

Except you don't need to know your account number to access your account. You only need your private key.  The public key is a way to view the balance without having access to the funds.   
And you are correct, you need to trust the software wallet developers. The good wallets are open source, and you can review the code yourself, and even compile your own version.  


Well, not all of us are. The code of the popular wallets has been audited and used for a long time by some of the most talented developers and testers in the world. It's more like you're trusting all of those people who have tested and staked their reputation on it. But it's not a minor concern. You are correct to always be concerned about these issues, and educate yourself about what measures are in place, how to verify your copy of the software, which wallets are most trusted, etc...

51% attack is a very specific thing my friend, not what you think I suspect; Also it's not the only vector to attack bitcoin security. A 51% attack is not required to double-spend a transaction. Further research "fully validating node" vs. "spv node".

You can pay people in bananas and it's basically the same accounting. You only need to worry about your bitcoin holdings with regards to capital gains and income. A regular accountant can help you, no bitcoin expert necessary. Only money transmitters need to worry about AML/KYC, as far as bitcoin goes. You're not running a money transmission business are you? Trading cash for bitcoin? No. Your bitcoin inventory can be handled in a number of ways depending on your cost basis and accounting method. Get an accountant, or do your own accounting if you can. Also, there's plenty written on the subject already. Google "pay employees with bitcoin". Or "bitcoin accounting", or "bitcoin capital gains".

Fees are listed on each exchanges website. Look for an exchange with market maker discounts, and never place a market order. My exchange doesn't have any fee for market maker orders. Aside from that, you should concern yourself with withdrawal fees. Check the fine print. Other fees you will encounter, but which are likely minimal considering your transaction size, are incoming deposit fees (and associated bank fees), and bitcoin network fees.

If 12K is vacation spending money for you, then maybe. I'd be nervous though without a hardware wallet or at least a good 2FA setup, which I'm not sure if bitpay has or not. I know mycelium has a pretty good setup for this. Another option would be to store some in a paper wallet, and reload your hot wallet as needed. Of course then you're vulnerable to physical theft but at least you're in control.

Also FYI, transactions are taking less than 10 minutes today because the mempool is empty and there is a lot of new hashing power since the last difficulty adjustment. So something is wrong. Where did you buy? Localbitcoins? I hope you didn't pay cash in person without waiting for confirmation... Its possible the seller accidentally selected a fee that was either zero, or very small; This would delay the transaction.

Technically no you can't "predict" fees because blocks propagate voluntarily, not by any sort of collective price fixing. You can see what fees are currently being accepted, and price your transaction accordingly. Nobody is obligated to confirm your transaction. Fee calculating algorithms within wallet software try to make this easy for everyone, but this functionality needs improvement. Some wallets are starting to allow manual fees, and this is a good step in the right direction toward a more direct, fluid, and transparent price discovery mechanism.

People "think" lots of stuff. Acting is a bit more difficult. Bitcoin is only useful to the extent it serves a real use, distinguishing itself from government fiat. Right now that real use is censorship resistance. The deflationary aspect is a nice design feature that has attracted many looking for a "sound money" or a "speculative asset".  In fact, the deflationary aspect has probably attracted more capital than the censorship resistance aspect. But if we're being really honest, all Bitcoin needs to do is out-compete other assets and currencies with regard to its supply/demand curve.  
 There could be inflation. If it did happen, many would leave and create their own alt without inflation, because sound money is market demand that's not going anywhere.  
  There is NO DOUBT Bitcoin will split eventually, and I wouldn't be surprised if inflation is the first real major hard fork; Presuming scaling doesn't create one. It could I guess.

Non-SMS 2FA is what you want. And highly preferable to be on a separate physical device from your wallet. And even better, one that isn't connected to the internet except to download the app.  Multisig is great, but more technical and better for things like sharing custody of private keys and fancy escrow setups.  2FA sometimes uses multisig under the hood, so to speak....

Any open source popular spv wallet with non-SMS 2FA enabled, with the 2FA preferably on a device you keep offline. Mulitsig works too in place of 2FA (requires more reading for you though).

Wallets don't charge fees. Miners do. Fee prices emerge through a free market mechanism for the limited space on the blockchain. Your transaction is selected voluntarily by miners. Wallets merely estimate fees based on the amount of data in your transaction, and they are generally terrible at it. You may want to choose one which allows manual fee entry. Right now, Electrum does this, but is only available for the desktop pc.  Others will come on board soon.  
It is important to note that manual fee entry leaves you at risk of delayed and failed transactions. A little research and trial-and-error will likely be necessary to manually calculate adequate fees.
Also,

That's not how wallets work. If you once had the address, you always have the address. Maybe there's a bug, but your address is yours.

It's unfortunate the more mainstream money that enters the market, the less the market cares about mining centralization, or even knows why it matters. Bitmain all but claims they own 51% of mining power, and the price doesn't seem to care, and so why should the miners care? Perhaps we'll have a moment of realization for them eventually. Who knows? But I sense the vast majority of the population couldn't care less about authoritarian control of money; People are clueless and will be for a long time to come.

Economic "downfalls" are not created equal. Do you mean "what would happen to the USD nominal price of Bitcoin"? Because that all depends on what happens to the Dollar. If the dollar is worth less, then it takes more dollars to buy a bitcoin, and vice versa. There is absolutely no reason to think we'll have replay of 2008. The Fed has assumed a far greater control of markets since then. They are far more likely to devalue the dollar than to let the market crash. Safe haven assets like metals and bitcoin could benefit, but not necessarily.

when is the last time you knew someone who was physically robbed? and what about hacked? that ratio might determine your opinion on the matter.

ISPs can't stop bitcoin at all. Not even a little. Are they going to try to ban cryptography and VPN too? The internet is global and decentralized, and will become even more so if a ban is attempted. There are P2P mesh networks that are ready to be deployed should govt try to stop the internet. Further,  Bitcoin can be transferred over radio signals, satellite, SMS, telephone, literally any channel that can transmit a digital communication. Bitcoin is actually unstoppable.

send/receive is a synonym for transfer. "went" means you said you "only see 4.6mbtc but this can't be my full balance". I don't know where it went.

I have been defrauded many times in lbc with vanilla cards, paypal, and gift cards. The spread is a reflection of the high fraud risk becuase these cards are often sold and resold and their origins are questionable. If you are going to buy a card for btc, demand a high spread, and get proof of origin and identity, including mailing address and photos.
Edit: And expect to lose some money, so spread your variance over many purchases, and smartly chose your customers. Don't feel bad charging high spread, you wilk get ripped off by people who seem nice and legit.

I don't understand how any equity that has risen with the pace of Bitcoin these past few years can be categorically eliminated from being classified a bubble.

Bitcoin price discovery doesn't work like other assets because there is no valuation model.  So round numbers are said to have significance. Of course, 6000 dollars is only "psychologically" significant to the us dollar markets.  
Using psychological levels is just one way of guessing where traders are looking for moves.  Other methods include trend lines, previous highs, fib levels, moving averages, rsi, cloud, etc etc...  It's really when a few of these indicators line up is when a trader should consider taking notice, because many people are looking at the same chart, and trying to construct a narrative that others might be following.

"Online wallet" is sort of a misnomer. There are software wallets, and exchange wallets which are online. If you mean "online" as opposed to paper wallets, then you mean software wallet.

"is there some way around this?"  yes. tax evasion is possible. but you have to understand the IRS can raid your home if they suspect something.  Hiding bitcoin is easy, but hiding the method you use to obtain the bitcoin is less easy.  The IRS also doesn't necessary need direct evidence to assess a tax or a fine. They can do so based on mere suspicion, and gaps in your accounting.  I know, it's completely unconstitutional, but tell that to the judge because you'll have a hard legal battle.

Transactions are completed in regular batches called blocks. Blocks happen on a random time schedule that averages 1 block per 10 minutes. You should know that doesn't mean blocks often occur every 10 minutes. Often it is 3 minutes, or 60 minutes. That said, the fee chart on that website tells you how many blocks you'll wait, on average, based on rough estimates, until your transaction will get confirmed initially. A single confirmation is the least number of confirmations any sane person would consider a completed payment. Most people want 3-6 confirmations to be very confident (for large amounts especially). Importantly, subsequent confirmations will occur during the following block times. Confirmations propagate the network in an exponential way, so you don't have to wait for average 10 minutes for each confirmation, only the first one. After the first one happens, subsequent confirmations happen quicker; Perhaps you will get 2 additional confirmations in the subsequent block time, and even more in the next one, and so on. Does that help you understand the language of that website?

Blame? No. Responsible? Yes.  
It is not "victim blaming" to say you shouldn't have left much on the exchange.  
Most, if not all of those funds could have been saved with proper risk mitigation, on both the part of Binance and the customers (as if Binance itself didn't steal the funds).

I have used itBit for years. They definitely have their quirks but are a solid company. For example withdrawals are done in a batch cycle processed a few times per day, so withdrawals are never fast, and don't happen at all on weekends.  Also, their website ui is VERY basic, and the streaming price feeds and data feeds are often not working at all. You can still see the order book and place a limit order (the only kind of order allowed on itbit), but the ticker and transaction history are often broken. All that said, I stick with them because they are consistent and reputable, and their service is good. Also, fee-free orders for market makers.

You don't have your terms correct. "BTC" isn't BCH. "btc" is bitcoin. "r/btc" is a sub dedicated to bch (aka bcash).   
Yes, it's intentionally confusing. Bcash wants you to believe it's the real bitcoin, through its use of confusing terms, and its appropriation of the r/btc sub, which used to be a bitcoin sub, but which is now an anti-btc aka anti-bitcoin sub.   
Make no mistake: "btc" is a legitimate abbreviation for bitcoin, used worldwide on exchanges, but r/btc is not a bitcoin sub.

Banks, like all corporations are regulatory creations, government creations through and through. This is not a problem of greed, this is a problem of short term political decisions affecting peoples long term monetary decisions. Central banks distort, pervert the investment decisions of those with capital. Saving money becomes bad instead of good. Debt becomes good instead of bad. Money isnt money, but debt under this Central Banking paradigm. The Fed is a private institution, but be clear, it is fascistic and corporatistic in every sense, pure government predominance.

1. network effect  
2.  hash power=security  and security=value 
3.   liquidty is king in the financial world. especially for stores of value, and even more so for units of account.
4. bitcoin isn't just software. the software has been copied as you described already but those shitcoins are worthless for reasons 1-3.  
5. If someone made it "better/more popular", then bitcoin would just copy that. It works both ways in open source.  
6. All that said, it's *possible* for another coin to defeat bitcoin, just unlikely for all the reasons listed.    
7. So what if bitcoin is replaced with something better? All things end eventually. You don't think the dollar is going to last forever do you? USD has lost 90% of its value since central banking started btw.

PoW is efficient because markets are efficient at distributing resources to where they are most needed. Fees and block reward (and *scary* carbon too!) are the (voluntary and willing) price for the service of providing financial freedom to the world. To the extent that people negatively value the carbon footprint, that necessarily puts downward pressure on demand, and therefore puts downward pressure on the size of the market for mining.    
You can believe that  PoW is useless or excessive or unnecessary, but you can't convince the people paying for it. Or at least you haven't yet.

Biggest help you could be is to let us all know how it happened.   
The obstacles to any sort of success with an investigation are:

2.  Convincing the owner of that known public address to investigate the matter.   
3. Proving to that owner that you were in fact scammed, and those are "legally" your funds.  
4. Short of that, involving a lawyer to pressure the owner to help with the investigation.

Obviously, with a market cap of only a few hundred billion, when compared to the historically proven hedge of gold, btc is not going to save the world today. Because when btc prices reach certain levels of growth velocity, the market sees a bubble and therefore a high risk asset instead of a hedge. Each new rally, and subsequent pullback, bumps the capacity for btc to act as a safe haven.  
That said, the novel scarcity dynamics of btc make legacy price discovery models obsolete, meaning volatility may always be an issue which users need to deal with. And this may put a cap on the amount of market share bitcoin can take from gold.

I can only assume I was pwned completely by a virtual desktop type hack. However, itBit staff must have noticed something strange (I haven't got their investigation results yet) because they stopped the withdrawal before it was processed. Maybe it was the activity: cancelling all my open orders, a market order for all funds, then immediately withdrawing 100% to a new address. Thanks itBit!

use limit orders on one of the many exchanges that offer free "maker" orders.  check their deposit fees.  use wire transfer, and only in amounts larger than $2000-3000.  fees will be minuscule. check your bank's wire fee also. shop around for a cheaper bank too. wire fees vary from $10-50ish.  you can get your fees down to less than 1% no problem, as long as your volume is high enough.

Meh. It uses a 2-of-2 multisig arrangment where blockstream keeps 1 of the signing keys. so you are depending on blockstream to get access to your bitcoin.    
You have to use a [recovery tool]( if blockstream service becomes unavailable, or if blockstream is unable or unwilling to sign the 2nd key. The recovery tool makes you wait 90 days to get access to your bitcoin.  
If you have a ton of trust in blockstream sticking around long term, or don't really care about waiting 90 days if they don't, then go for it.  
Consider Mycelium, Electrum, Samurai...

This comes down to some very personal views on trust which I cannot presume to know about you. To what extent do you trust your own memory? You can add a layer of encryption with your mind; there are many ways to do this. This sort of shallow password protection is enough to obfuscate the contents, and require significant (ish) work just to figure out if it's worth cracking. You can eliminate the risk of "fogetting" by adding another version, stored behind another kind of memory password which is composed of a list of questions only you and 1 (or more) other person knows the answers to. Another option is to create a password based on a book or text; You can reference pages, or positions of characters; and only the name of the book needs to be remembered. This is shallow protection granted. Why not just use real 2FA again? Or multisig?

I'll save you the click:  


Bitcoin prices have surged nearly 60% to about $6,000 after plunging almost 75% in 2018.
Sure, the cryptocurrency is still far from its all-time highs of just under $20,000, which it hit in December 2017. But crypto investors are increasingly optimistic that the bitcoin (XBT) bounce of 2019 is real and that it and other cryptocurrencies may enjoy a steady march higher.


But bitcoin may finally be trading at an appropriate price.  


The key for bitcoin going forward is for the gains to moderate a bit so history doesn't repeat itself. No one wants another bloodbath like in 2018.
"The huge crash in 2018 was a correction after a speculative mania. The gains in 2017 were astronomical," said Everett Millman, an analyst with Gainesville Coins, an investment firm specializing in precious metals and cryptocurrencies.


So why has bitcoin bounced back so dramatically? Crypto investors increasingly believe bitcoin was oversold last year and is now becoming a legitimate investment for people looking to hedge the risk of currency and interest rate fluctuations. 


"The selling in bitcoin got exhausted last year and people started to come back in around $4,000," said Tyrone Ross, managing partner with NobleBridge Wealth Management.
"You are now starting to see more people cite bitcoin as a credible asset that you can use to diversify your portfolio. People are looking at bitcoin as a type of digital gold," Ross added.


Shares of online retailer Overstock (OSTK), for example, have fallen more than 7% this year as the company struggles to prove to Wall Street that its crypto-related businesses can grow quickly enough to offset the continued losses in its core e-commerce business.
Bitcoin going mainstream
But bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are going mainstream with both individual investors and larger institutions.


And ICE (ICE), the owner of the NYSE, has launched Bakkt, a futures exchange for bitcoin and other cryptos. All of this adds legitimacy — and perhaps stability — to bitcoin. It no longer has to be the 21st century market equivalent of the Wild West.








But Weiss said bitcoin, as well as rival cryptocurrencies, including ripple/XRP, ethereum, cardano and EOS, should continue to rise over the long haul. And it wouldn't be a problem if the pace of the gains begins to slow. In fact, it might be a welcome development.


"Bitcoin can gradually crawl back to its all-time highs over several years, but hopefully it doesn't happen too quickly. If it does, investors could get burned again," he added.

If you are outside the us, you can open a bitfinex account, and use that app's alerts.  Not sure which US exchanges offer alerts, perhaps gdax does.  Another option is to sign up for a tdameritrade account, and use one of their apps to get alerts on bitcoin futures and gbtc.  
Other than that, I know you can pay for alerts with a tradingview paid account, which is a bit expensive unless you are a somewhat serious trader.  The chartguys also offer a rather intensive crypto alert system, which is a bit pricey, but I believe you can negotiate the price if you can make contact with Dan through his youtube, or website.

If it were a bank note, they wouldn't be paying 1.39 for it. In fact some banks don't pay $1 for $1 anymore; there are negative interest rates, and some even charge fees for cash deposits. Further the $1 I mention here, is worth less by the time you finish the sentence thanks to governments counterfeiting their own currency.

I don't know what you're looking for in particular. The big commercial exchanges in the US are Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, Kraken... other smaller ones I guess. For an exchange account, you'll need to go though the whole KYC/AML identification process to get an account, a sometimes lengthy verification process, especially at Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini. I haven't heard any complaints about itBit lately. Coinbase is super popular because they allow ACH, debit, and credit card payment, but you pay for that convenience with a really nannying of your activity. For more serious investors, a "real" exchange who generally accept wire transfer usd deposits, like GDAX (a separate branch of coinbase), Gemini, itBit, Kraken in order of popularity/trading volume. If smaller amounts of anonymous bitcoin is what you seek, then maybe Localbitcoins, bitquick.co, paxful, bitsquare, etc would be good to check out. This latter group are peer-to-peer escrow platforms where the website provides the interface with a marketplace of many sellers, and provides an escrow service that helps ensure you don't get ripped off.  Scams are definitely a thing, so you need to be street smart with peer-to-peer exchanges.  But you'll avoid having to show an ID for small amounts. Anonymizing your bitcoin is more complicated than simply getting coins from these sites though...but not assuming you care.

a real bitcoin wallet is a piece of software, typically open source, that gives you real actual custody and control of your bitcoin. an exchange is a 3rd party custodian. custodial services shouldn't use the term "wallet" for custodial accounts, IMO, but they do all the time. the difference is custody.

What he means to say is the blockchain transactions are performed on a system with scarce resources. And unlike corporate systems who would merely disallow or subsidize transaction amounts below a certain threshold where those fees would exceed an arbitrary subjective amount chosen by the creators (for example, an amount equal to the net amount of the transfer), bitcoin's decision making system has been designed to allow the price of fees to be discovered by a negotiation, deciding what the network participants are willing to pay for their place in the limited transaction space, and what the proof-of-work machine operators are willing to accept as payment for processing the transaction and more importantly for doing the work necessary to win the right to write that transaction to the immutable and technologically novel bitcoin blockchain network. 
Since anyone can operate a proof-of-work machine, and anyone can participate in the network, it's a free market exchange for limited resources between voluntary participants. There is debate as to whether that system can be improved to lower fees in a way that doesn't make it too cheap to attack the system, or negatively effect its decentralized (aka free market) characteristics. It is not a simple matter of increasing capacity, necessarily. These are important decisions which will effect not only the value but the utility of Bitcoin.

It's ultimately a negotiation between the what the miner community will accept for fees, and what the user community will pay to support the price of the coins being mined. Not to mention the similar negotiations that happen between miners and hardware manufacturers to support those costs.

New wallet technology called "SPV wallets" in which it's no longer necessary to download the blockchain, or to have running in the background. Many spv wallets available for desktop and mobile (desktop: Electrum, mobile: Mycelium, Jaxx) . If you are storing significant amounts, then a non-SMS 2FA is highly recommended along with your software wallet. Even better these days are "hardware wallets", as far as security.

Trading is NOT a game of guessing peaks and bottoms. It's a game of setups, plans, and strategies. Trading is determining risk-reward ratios and devising a set of if-then statements to execute for high probability returns. You don't have to be right every time, or even "right" about anything in particular. You just have to get paid enough on profit-resulting setups to make up for the times when your setups make losses. Most traders don't just use 1 setup. Traders make many setups, and often traders will ladder or stack over a range of price and time targets, and adjust as the market moves.

fees aren't charged per transaction, or by amount. your fees are based on the data size of your transaction, and varies based on network conditions. Network conditions can be assessed here:




Currently the average transaction to be confirmed in the next block (within 10-30 minutes) is paying 80,000 satoshi, or 300 satoshi per byte.  80,000 satoshi = .0008 bitcoin = $2.  You can pay less, and wait longer.  In fact, some transactions are confirming with zero fee right now.

Confirmations are what prove your ownership, or prove the transaction happened. The more confirmations, the more sure the transaction is complete. You have 86 confirmations as of this moment. Anything over 6 confirmations, and you can bet your house on its security. Electrum should not be reporting this still in "pending" status (are you connected?). This has been confirmed for quite a while. Also, know that posting your transaction id has permanently connected this reddit account to those funds. Your privacy, and the privacy of anyone you send those funds to have now been compromised.  PS. You can check your transaction id at any block explorer website. TOR is recommended for transaction privacy.

It's been answered. There is a risk of an exchange not recognizing a chain split, since you don't have private keys on an exchange. They are only obligated to give you bitcoin. That said, it would be a public relations nightmare for any exchange to essentially steal the forked coins from their clients. Traders are highly intelligent and motivated by their investment.  They will demand, and exchanges will oblige to make a statement prior to any possible split. 
TLDR; Don't worry about us, we're not stupid and neither are exchanges.

None. Seriously none that you can trust to divulge your activity to.  When the big nationals shut you down, best to go to local banks and credit unions. There are lots of bank accounts you can open.

After that, we'll see a bounce over 2000, just to crash back down to 1750. From there, my crystal ball becomes a bit blurry. Check in then. Oh, the cause is FUD of course. Everyone here knows that.

These are good questions, but so loaded. Your instinct about risking your bank account is correct. Running a money transmission business via a personal bank account can definitely get your account closed. High volume cash deposits from all over the country can get your account closed. Been there many times. LBC has data you can use for taxes, but always good to keep them yourself.  Payment methods are the subject of many many posts. On a high level, ANYTHING except CASH in hand can be reversed after the fact with little or no recourse. That said, wire transfers are very safe, and almost irreversible.  Cash deposits into your bank are almost just as good, with some caveats and attack vectors you should research. MoneyGram and Western Union work well, because you don't release until you get cash in hand.  Everything else though is risky, but that's not to say you shouldn't do it. High risk, high reward; As evidenced by the exchange rates for these other payment methods. Newbs can expect as much as 50% of their payments to be reversed until they figure out how to spot a scammer, and how to craft their offers, and gain a trusted customer base. Expect losses and frustration early on. It's a process that cannot be entirely avoided, even with preparation and research. I'd suggest diving in, and doing small amounts to get your reputation up.

I'll burn down every forest in the universe if it means fighting government's unethical enslavement of the population. Your academic argument is irrelevant to the choices we face in reality.  
 You cannot secure a network without work. You cannot work without burning energy. Bitcoin will get as big as the market demands. The battle will not be fought between coddled American college students pretending they know what global warming is, and greedy monocle-wearing capitalists trying to blacken the sky in some dystopian vision. The battle is fought every time government imprisions someone for a victimless crime. You're barking up the wrong tree.  Bitcoin would be irrelevant without government. Also, you fail to include the hidden costs of government.  
 If Bitcoin is not expensive to secure, then Bitcoin isn't secure at all. That's economics. Your threshold of "too expensive" doesn't matter. You are irrelevant to the economic forces at play.

source: 
Take the total network Th/s and divide by your total Th/s. That number gives you you a number that tells you how many blocks will occur before you get one (on average).
So if there is currently 3,666 Th/s on the network, and you have a 0.55 Th/s (like you would if you have a $5,000 KNCMiner Jupiter ASIC), then 3,666/0.55 = 6,665.
That means you have 1/6,665ths of total hashing capacity. There will be 6,665 blocks before you get one.
So if there are 144 blocks in a day, then you need to wait 46.28 days to get a block when mining solowith that hardware. But that is assuming difficulty doesn't rise. So what will happen with a rising difficulty is you end up waiting much longer even, and possibly never end up getting a block when solo mining.
That's why solo mining is not as profitable as using a pool for anyone without tens of Th/s nowadays.

After reading this, I see the 2fa is provided by a service called "trusted coin". It's a 2 of 3 multig arrangement where Trusted Coin hold only 1 of the signing keys. Now with GA enabled on the wallet, presumably it erases one of the keys that you own, and therefore you need GA for that wallet instance.  Your restore seed could then be used to restore without GA if you hadn't lost it.  But I don't  know if all is lost.  Theoretically, they could assist you in retrieving it (they have 1 key, plus the 1 key left with your GA-enabled wallet I assume), perhaps with the help of the Electrum people.  I don't know, but it would appear there is hope at least.  Seems like a password should be good enough to prove you own the key, if they designed the password security correctly.

Also, the wallet integrates with a variety of software wallets, making them orders of magnitude safer AND easier to use than any flash drive setup you can conjure.

Your cancellation request, if it has any chance of being obliged, MUST be made to Coinbase (probably first) or your bank (just in case that fails). If you go to your bank though, you will likely be charged a reversal fee with Coinbase and maybe your bank, or have your Coinbase account suspended. Your bank could also reconsider your business.

It's also summer. The mempool will start filling when a threshold of transactions/second is reached and will remain empty until then. Such things will tend toward a binary state of: filling up vs. being empty. It's the nature of database queues. In a normal private database, outside forces like price will regulate incoming transactions. But in a free and open system (like the mempool, not Bitcoin), you will tend toward filling completely. An empty queue isn't a good sign really, but like I said, it's summer.

Those aren't "app wallets" precicely, those are exchanges who happen to have apps that look like personal wallets but aren't exactly. It's a 3rd party who is holding your bitcoin, and watching all your transactions (and blocking some!). Newbs like this kind of service because it's a sort of 1 stop shop rather than doing what experienced buyers do which is buy on an exchange, and move to a personal wallet. You'll hear it a 1000 times if you stick around, "If you don't hold the keys, they aren't your bitcoins". So just keep in mind if you don't want to keep a personal wallet, you are trusting a 3rd party. It's like trusting your parents when your young; Eventually you realize you'd rather make your own decisions.

An exchange is 2 people trading. There is no "the price". They are not connected in any way you're imagining. The exchange businesses you mention are companies that publicize an order book made up of buy and sell orders from anyone who wants to buy or sell. Those exchanges collect a transaction fee. But you aren't paying the exchanges "rate" for bitcoin, you're paying the cheapest seller's offer, and only the quantity he has to sell at that price. Order books are made of living and breathing individuals, each trying to negotiate a price with the next guy.

I'm confused. Are we talking about actual RSK or are we calling something RSK "for example" like you say in the first sentence? Because it doesn't sound like you're describing real RSK. Not coherently anyway. Further, there is zero evidence a 1:1 peg can hold in the way described, and lots of counter evidence. An added layer automatically increases risk, whether you wish it away or not.  The market isn't stupid. A bunch of multisigs like what is offered in the RSK peg hasn't proven itself any more effective a stable peg than what USDTether has done. It's just a promise, a bottleneck, and an extra technical layer with additional unknown unknowns. Market prices ("pegged" or otherwise) hate bottlenecks and unknown unknowns.

How many shitcoins do we have? and none seem to be doing much solving. Just making more issues, and taking people's money.

You'll be fine. No "conversion" took place.  And you certainly didn't "transfer USD from Coinbase to...Kraken".  There is no USD token in existance.  USDT (aka USD"Tether") transactions use the bitcoin blockchain and are marketed as being "pegged" to the USD. It's not really pegged in any guaranteed way though. That aside, if you can get the private keys sent back to you, you can spend it to the correct address. Kraken will probably help as they control the private keys currently. Your coins will still maintain their respective value when viewed using the proper block explorer/wallet. At least, this is my understanding. I've never done this.

Transaction fees are not really a function of the wallet, although most wallets (still) are bad at calculating and some don't let you manually choose a fee (Mycelium you bastards!). Further, all wallets are free that I know of.  For security, you need a wallet with non-SMS 2FA, and with the ability to pair a hardware wallet; Multisig is also useful for some more technical or professional people.  For desktop, Electrum is the current leader. For mobile, you have Mycelium and Jaxx, and a couple others which escape me.
EDIT: "Security" means different things to different people, so you may want to clarify what you need exactly.

Wells Fargo doesn't deal in Bitcoin. If they have a secret policy about how much USD they allow to be received from companies they know to be "bitcoin" companies, through ACH or Fed Wire, they won't say it. I have had bank accounts shut down, but it isn't really directly related to Bitcoin but high volume cash deposits associated with peer-to-peer exchange like can be done through Localbitcoins, or bitquick.co.  That said, banks are free to close your account if they see you as a risk. Bitcoin is seen as a risk by many people in the banking industry. Accounts have been closed. It could happen. It probably won't normally.
EDIT: Regarding taxes, you need to report profits so save your transaction histories.  Bitcointaxes.com helps consolidate your bitcoin activities and calculate gains. A tax pro can help too. Or just do some research and do it your own way.

TAILS is useful for using darknetmarkets. It erases your history from the machine, and uses TOR to obfuscate your IP. TOR (and TAILS) isn't really useful for logging into exchanges unless you're up to something nefarious.  2FA (non-SMS 2FA on a separate device from the browser you're using to log into services) is good security. Other than that, a trusted machine is good. Linux and Qubes are top choices for security professionals, but most people don't know how to use an OS in a very secure manner.  You can start by having a separate machine only used for bitcoin activity (and otherwise keep turned off), and which you reimage (and update for security) on a regular basis to keep fresh and free of malware. Again though, non-SMS 2FA is a really good start. 
EDIT: Further regarding keeping your bitcoin secure, don't keep it on exchanges except when you are actively trading. Keep your bitcoin in a secure wallet, meaning one with non-sms 2fa, or a hardware or paper wallet.

Stealing private keys is easy. Wallet pin numbers and passwords are notoriously weak, but it doesn't matter if you find a strong one. Never trust your desktop or mobile device alone. A hacker doesn't need to hack your password or pin number; They have screen capture, keyloggers, etc.... Non-SMS 2FA, Multisig, hardware wallets, or paper wallets are the best answer.

It's not an EFT technically. But just look at the chart my friend. How "closely" it follows bitcoin is certainly debatable. The instrument itself has its own set of systemic counterparty risk. It's not the same as buying bitcoin because of this added layer of complexity, which can (and does) have unexpected effects on how it tracks the price. Some times it acts like a futures contract because of the lack of liquidity, and sometimes its price reacts to market competition in the etf space.   That said, I've used it a couple times when I couldn't move money fast enough to a bitcoin exchange, but saw a trading opportunity or divergence I wanted to play. You will notice that it moves slow and jerky because of low liquidity, so your orders have less opportunity to fill than in an active bitcoin exchange.

Okay I can see you're technically lacking competence. If you are asking how to turn bitcoin into USD, then all you need to do is create an account at a major US exchange, transfer the bitcoin from the wallets, and make the trade and withdraw to your bank account.  If you have specific wallet function questions, post them here. Just get the name of the wallet (Trezor, check, and others?), and tell us if you have problems transferring the bitcoin to your exchange account.  If you want to keep this money off-grid, then you need to find a person to trade with who you trust. Likely still, you will have to submit ID for amounts over a few thousand usd.  Gemini and itBit are regulated US exchanges.

"What he means to say is the blockchain transactions are performed on a system with scarce resources. And unlike corporate systems who would merely disallow or subsidize transaction amounts below a certain threshold where those fees would exceed an arbitrary subjective amount chosen by the creators (for example, an amount equal to the net amount of the transfer), bitcoin's decision making system has been designed to allow the price of fees to be discovered by a negotiation, deciding what the network participants are willing to pay for their place in the limited transaction space, and what the proof-of-work machine operators are willing to accept as payment for processing the transaction and more importantly for doing the work necessary to win the right to write that transaction to the immutable and technologically novel bitcoin blockchain network.
Since anyone can operate a proof-of-work machine, and anyone can participate in the network, it's a free market exchange for limited resources between voluntary participants. There is debate as to whether that system can be improved to lower fees in a way that doesn't make it too cheap to attack the system, or negatively effect its decentralized (aka free market) characteristics. It is not a simple matter of increasing capacity, necessarily. These are important decisions which will effect not only the value but the utility of Bitcoin."

Usually they don't care until you start getting many amounts over $3000, start exceeding certain thresholds in terms of # or volume of transactions, or start getting complaints or problems having to do with those transactions. YES THEY MAY ASK. DON'T TELL THEM ANYTHING. THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIEND. ALSO, don't lie unless you know you can fool them. You probably can't. Just ask them to present their questions in writing, since it would appear they are performing legal duties in asking.

Security doesn't come from any single wallet but from your ability to use it securely. Non-SMS 2FA is minimum for anything approaching secure IMO. Best practice is a hardware wallet, or paper wallets for bitcoin you don't touch much. Multisig is another feature that offers some flexibility for sharing wallets, or for adding security.  That said, stick with the popular wallets like Electrum for desktop, Mycelium, Jaxx, Breadwallet for mobile. Blockchain.info just made some nice improvements to their wallet too. That or if you want to run a server 24/7 and download the entire blockchain, you can have your own full-validating node wallet via Core, and others.

Legal regulated entities will to varying degrees, and at their own arbitrary discretion and judgement, close accounts if you put their business at risk. If you want to avoid such scrutiny, IT IS UP TO YOU to protect your privacy. You need to keep those transactions off grid, so to speak. If you don't know how to get anonymous/private bitcoins, or aren't willing to pay the premium and time to get them, you will eventually be disappointed by any 3rd party legal entity who you trust store and disperse your property.

@_date: 2017-06-30 12:59:24
I got here as fast as I can. Looks like I'm not too late. Use a wallet with custom fee calculation, and you can enter a zero fee if you like. The transaction may never confirm, and it would then likely return to your wallet later. Or you can set a very small fee, and it will likely confirm eventually. If you're not in a hurry, set a fee of 50 sat/byte, and it will probably confirm eventually. If you send a low fee transaction and it gets "stuck" for long, there are a couple things your can try. I recommend doing this with the Electrum wallet, which has custom fees, and something called RBF where you can resend the transaction later with a larger fee.

Price fixing doesn't work. The market pays the cost, and price fixing just complicates things, makes primary network function less efficient, and moves the costs somewhere else. Likely the cost would just be built into the price of the coin as miners have to charge more to cover costs eventually. However then there would be no incentive for miners to exist after block rewards expire. And contrary to what children and other communists claim, people don't work and invest quality resources to anything worth while, without real value exchange.

If that represents a substantial amount of value to you, and you want to be able to use on an online computer, you need non-SMS 2FA, or multisig, or a paired hardware wallet.

Coinbase has not submitted the transaction to the network yet. When you say "it's not possible for my coin to disappear", you seem to be misunderstanding the relationship between you, coinbase, and the bitcoin network.  Coinbase is no different than a bank. They possess the Bitcoin, which they owe to you. Now that means you ARE NOT IN POSSESSION OF THE BITCOIN. Nor do you have control of the bitcoin. Coinbase does. You have requested they send a transaction. Now they send it whenever they get around to it. Your question is for Coinbase, and has nothing to do with whether Bitcoin can "disappear" or not (it can't).

Open an exchange account and buy, or use peer-to-peer services like Localbitcoins, bitquick.co, paxful. Be careful of scams at lbc and paxful. If you buy on an exchange, move your bitcoin to a private and safe wallet after you buy, unless you want to day trade or swing trade.

Bitcoin is highly leveraged and extremely speculative, so yeah.  Even though the supply is technically limited, it's "limit" is enforced by an unproven novel system with unknown (and known) attack vectors. The longer it proves itself as a secure store of value, the less speculative it becomes, eliminating much of the reason for its volatility. Volatility is, after all, a function of the wavering confidence of investors. It takes more than a few years to convince the world.

"Intrinsic value" suggests something has value "in and of itself".   Food, oxygen, water, have intrinsic value to those who need it.  Gold bugs like to say gold has "intrinsic value" because it can be used for things other than money.

Bitcoin.tax is a neat website that help you consolidate the data from your exchanges, and choose the cost basis method that give you the best result. There may be others, but that's the one I've used for 2 years. If you are an active trader, you'll pay to import your transactions for the year.  You can do it manually with spreadsheets too, but it's tedious and complicated for any fancy cost basis methods.  Exchanges don't typically send you anything.

Depends what you plan to do with the bitcoin. For security and functionality, hardware wallets can't be beat but they cost 30-150 usd. For simple storage, and holding long term, paper wallets are cheap and secure if properly handled. Aside from that you have Electrum, the desktop wallet, and a bunch of mobile wallets, Mycelium, Jaxx, Breadwallet, Greenaddress, etc... Using these software wallets without 2FA is not recommended, but probably fine for small amounts you don't care about.  You can buy at any exchange you want. Visit their sites, and look at the features. Coinbase and Blockchain.info are popular but also Gemini, itbit, if we're talking about USA.  If you want to skip the tedious and invasive account creation process, you can just buy small amounts for cash via Localbitcoins, Bitquick.co, or Paxful, however these last 3 are prone to scammers if you're not careful because they are peer to peer services. Actually bitquick.co doesn't really get scammers.

It's important to understand that using Mycelium Local Trader is transacting with any random individual with a Mycelium Wallet. There is a feedback system with star ratings, but that's the only thing making it "safe". I don't find the star rating system on even Amazon to be exactly "safe" in determining the quality of a product, so buyer beware on Mycelium too. Localbitcoins.com has probably every seller you see in Mycelium, and many more. The bigger marketplace is your "safest" bet. Other options are Paxful and bitquick.co. Be VERY careful to avoid scammers in Paxful, LBC and Mycelium especially.

To be technical, there is no "price" of bitcoin. There is only what price particular individuals have to offer at this moment in time, and only for the volume they choose to offer it at. Xapo's price might be "calculated" but it could just as easily be some guy sitting at a desk deciding what the price is from one moment to the next. Xapo is not a big exchange, so they don't offer big (and liquid) exchange prices, which are available in exchanges because of the tens of thousands of traders competing for orders. You're also of course paying for the 2nd layer services, and overhead of a small exchange without the benefits of a large scale. If you can buy elsewhere for cheaper, then do it by all means. I highly recommend you go and look at a big exchange's order book to understand price discovery. It's enlightening, and mesmerizing to the uninitiated.

a deterministic wallet doesn't have just one private key. if you have only 1 private key, you don't have your entire wallet. it's possible all of your funds are stored in that single key, and that would mean you do in fact have access to your funds. check the "public key" (not private!) on the blockchain to find out. if you don't have the public key, you, and you really only have a single private key, then basically you have a paper wallet, which you can "sweep" into a wallet with a sweep function, and see what's in it.

If you're looking for a simple solution, you can just take a risk and buy USDTether at one of the exchanges. This coin **attempts** to follow the price of the us dollar. It has sold for as low as .70/dollar during a time of high liquidity and doubt about the security of the peg.  It could go to zero, and there is no guarantee your value will hold.  That said, it might be a decent partial solution at least. Another thing you can do is open an account with 1Broker (or the like) and trade crypto/forex pairs, some blue chip stocks, and other things. You will pay a spread of course.

There is a gambling term called bet sizing which is important to understanding investment strategy. You already decided you want to invest.

itBit is a very basic exchange (only limit orders), good for large amounts and traders who baby sit their trades, free trades for market makers, $10 wires i think, but the nice thing is incoming wires take minutes. The crappy thing is they are closed on weekends and holidays, so no btc withdrawals, except on their 2x daily weekday batch cycle. Service has always been responsive. The website is minimal, and their api is almost always down, even the bid and ask are usually blank, it's pathetic. And the trade history is clunky and slow.Also not always super liquid, so day trading is not recommended (not that it stops me). More for swing trading, longer term trades, buy and hold strategies, OTC traders. But it tracks bitstamp pretty closely, just a little less volume. Solid depending on your needs, might be too basic.
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:01:26
  Your first claim here is the miner's "price/cost" is....oh no wait, you didn't even claim anything here, you just named a subject without a predicate. Then you say "The real price is $1400 for the actual difficulty of the network!", implying there is a fake difficulty? If I put my retard cap on for a second, I would infer something approaching a complete statement or claim if I combine these 2 barely coherent idea fragments (and maybe cross my eyes look at it sideways).  
You're saying fees are higher than they need to be, because of a false economy that has been created by miner monopoly; And that like for all artificially managed economies, there must be a cycle of price repression, and subsequent unexpected but eventual price discovery. So that would imply Bitcoin is in a bubble created by excess fee price inflation. Have I got that right? You're pretty smart after all.  
I disagree though. I mean if that's what you're saying. Is it?

Probably better off using lbc or the others considering abra is new and offers little incentive for "tellers" to join, the way they pretend to offer "small" fees but have no way of enforcing low fees since it's just a peer-to-peer voluntary, non-employeed network of traders, just like lbc but without the customers (abra customers are traders who don't know they are actually traders because of abras consumer friendly marketing language and interface) and "trader" traders (abras "tellers" are in-person local traders who have signed up to explicitly offer their trading service through the abra network). In fact one should expect to find higher fees in general on Abra considering their niche position and boutique model. That, or it's the killer app we've been looking for. What do I know?

Once you have given away your private key (or scanned it into your not-very-trustworthy computer), you can't take it back. It is definitely a risk, and hopefully mycelium has a warning before it lets you do that. Also, even if you don't mind that risk, you still damage the privacy of yourself and others by reusing addresses. Best practice for your own privacy, and good ettiquitte for your business partner's privacy, is to avoid reusing addresses unless you know what you're doing.

zoom out. up 100% in a few months. no *comeback* necessary. whether the rally continues or not is another question. i suspect the fee pressure from the last few days will tend to put the brakes on somewhat, although high fees are a clear sign of high demand so you never know.

Also, not sure if you've been paying attention. But public committees (aka votes) don't produce innovative technology. They produce things like the US Post Office. Maybe a government job is more your thing.

Why won't they take an insignificant portion of their hashing power and attack the chain when block times slow down? I'm all for political action, but only if there's a chance of success. Protests, petitions, sloganeering and especially "making a point no matter how costly and disruptive" don't do much for me. Where is the "force" in this proposal? Do you have any idea of the amount of participation you need to make the attack have a significant cost (cost other than some imagined social currency)?

why? in what way? if you have a design improvement, submit it. decentralization isn't a goal. it's a means to an end. efficiency and scale are trade-offs. when a bitcoin transaction gets censored by a mining regime, then we know there's a problem with decentralization. when a mining cartel is able to push through a contentious hard fork without users, exchanges, merchants, and other stakeholders (sounds pretty decentralized doesn't it?) consent, then we know there's a problem. last time they tried, they failed. remember?
