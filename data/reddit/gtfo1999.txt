I loved your post.  fuck the haters.  hodl

Thank you. I only started using exchanges in the last few weeks...when I realized that BTC is already a dinosaur.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:07:07
I don't think it's complex, but there was just a news story that stated "People now know that you can buy a fraction of bitcoin."  So...there's that working against me
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:11:38
No shit.  What's your point?

I am watching a grown man whine about a nick name for his digital money, and how he was already so rich before he invented it.   People like that need to get their buttons pushed so Kudos to the interviewer. We all know BCH is riding the coattails of BTC.  Who cares.  As long as it's worth money.

Well theoretically you are right, but I have to be skeptical after what happened yesterday with Coinbase and BCH.  Also why are there 15 different prices for one universal coin?

I don't hate Americans, I just get annoyed at uneducated people listening to the advice of some douchebag on CNN about this new major technology that is changing everything about money. 
But Americans are the biggest doubters of new technology...unless of course It's a Prius.

That may seem like the angle I was headed in, but no.  What I mean is I'm annoyed that these people didn't listen to me for a year...then want my help, and then doubt me in the process.  Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:57:48
Thanks.  I needed to hear that.

Excuse me?  what do u mean "buying into the bitcoin cult"   I started "buying in" a year ago.  Im am the cult pal.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:36:53
You're prob right.  I lived in Seattle for the last two years so I prob got the worst of it.

You think so?  
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:59:25
I tried educating them for a year.  Ive explained it, Ive showed them and still people don't listen and do dumb things after I tell them not to. 
The world is very rigid and they fear change.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:05:38
How is my head up my ass?  That connotation doesn't even make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:25:37
You're absolutely right.  I'm not but I needed to rant about it.  Like complaining to a group of people who can relate.  Perhaps Reddit was not the right place.  Duly noted.

Up voted because I'm turning 42 next week.  So I'm old af

Thank you.  This is the reply I wanted. I have recently moved back to the East coast after 17 years on the West.  It is a whole different way of life.  I really just appreciate the fact that there is someone out there who understands my pain. Cheers mate.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:55:01
Haha  the WORST question is "When should I sell it?"  
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:08:40
Don't respond?  That's even worse than responding.
