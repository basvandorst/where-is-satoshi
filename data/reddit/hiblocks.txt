 Coinbase has had a bad reputation in regards to customer service.  Withdraws are usually delayed for shady reasons.  This could be a case of leaving before shit hits the fan.

Does anyone know where this ATM is in Seoul?  Would like to test it out and see how it works.
@_date: 2019-06-18 03:14:14
Is this correct?  Why is South Korea not on the list at all?
@_date: 2019-06-18 04:58:26
Yes Japan at 3% is strange....the list as a whole is strange.  Didn't realize Turkey, Brazil, and Columbia were the kings of crypto....

 This ATM is not just for bitcoin.  You can buy Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin with cash.  It takes less than 1 minute.  Yes, it is expensive (30%) but at least it is a start.  Gotta start somewhere.

I would recommend any talks by Andreas Antonopoulos.  He does a great job of explaining Bitcoin so the average person can understand.  Will keep an eye out for a good documentary but haven't seen one yet.

291 troy ounces of gold is around $400,000.  
1 BTC = $400,000!!  That will be my selling point.

Yea criminals should use cash rather than Bitcoin.  Cash is untraceable as it gets.

Would love to see the growth chart

Just a question,  what happens if the address is correct but the amount is different.  For example you send .1515 btc when you should have sent .1516?  I am guessing this could be a problem but wasn't sure.

I wonder if this will be the start of Kimchi Premium 2.0!!

Didn't John Mcafee predict that bitcoin will hit 1 million by 2020 or he else he will eat something....

That was a $99 Million Pizza.....

Agree his impact will be felt for decades after he is gone.

No.  I would not recommend as they are known for having bad customer service and no insurance in case of hacking.

If it ever goes back down to $5,000.  Jumping back in.  This time I mean it....

Agree what he says is correct...history shows Bitcoin by far has had the best ROI

Ron Paul speaks the truth but he is 83 years old!  Afraid he won't see the day when he gets to tell the world "I told you so".
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:22:18
