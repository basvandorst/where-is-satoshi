I do.  Doesn't accomplish anything.  Politicians just wont deliver the bad news that austerity is required to undo the bad policy decisions in the past.  Nobody is going to say that deficit spending should be stopped, entitlements should be rolled back.  Etc...  They aren't going to solve this problem so the marketplace has with bitcoin.


That's right.  And as the US economy continues to decelerate (insert talk about fake statistics, job numbers that don't tell the real story, ridiculous low inflation claims here), that confidence will continue to erode.  The dollar is losing its place as a reserve currency.


Soon?  Um, not for quite some time.


Negative interest rates and bank bail-ins don't concern you?  What's it going to take to get you to see this growth is over?


My point is that the price of gold is influenced not by international trade but by the paper markets.  Not sure if I ever said the value of gold has never dropped.


Exactly.  We need a proxy for value.  I choose bitcoin for its feature set.


Say it with me - Value is subjective.  If someone believes bitcoin's utility will push its value up, it makes sense to invest.  Same thing for Apple's stock.  If you think Apple will provide additional desired products/services in the future, you invest in Apple.  Doesn't mean you're a scammer.


That's true.  Not the best example.  I retract that statement..


Of course people need to adapt it for it to succeed.  Not sure what the sunset comment was all about though.


Very possible.  I do think, however, you and I have a differing opinion on how we want the economy to proceed and bitcoin is a sideline issue.  It appears you'd like more of what we've been doing so far:  Encourage spending instead of saving.  Continually increase the money supply resulting with inflation to encourage higher money velocity.  Keep interest rates low or even negative.  Deficit spending, quantitative easing and so on.  I'm just glad I have a new candidate to back.  The beautiful thing is that neither you nor I decide - the market does.  Can't wait to see what it chooses.


If you call a world-accepted currency that requires negligible fees open 24/7 on a controlled and limited money supply non-revolutionary, I suppose that's your prerogative.  World problems like overprinting a currency people are trying to store their excess labor inside of would be over.  That's a win for the people who would like to save for the future instead of being forced to spend today.
As for my future, I'd say bitcoin is currently 25% of my portfolio.  25% is precious metals and the rest is my brokerage account.  By the way, my investment in bitcoin was only 5% at the time, it's ~25% now due to its appreciation.  I'm not saying that to brag but to show that I'm not all in and never was as, regretfully, Keynesian believers who have never seen deflation are a huge obstacle that just might prove insurmountable.   Anyhow, I think I'm fairly hedged.  Don't invest anything more in something than you're willing to lose - and that applies well beyond bitcoin.
Thanks for the kind words and the debate.  Peace and prosperity to you as well.

Very fair point.  Would be nice if businesses subtracted the ~2.5% credit card fee if you use bitcoin.
Also, as more businesses see their suppliers are accepting bitcoin, I imagine they'll elect to keep a greater percentage of the purchases in bitcoin.  I know I'm getting tired of wiring money to my international suppliers.  Takes a hell of a long time and in-person signatures.

Completely agree except that being off the gold standard gives you many more opportunities to make bad policy decisions.


I agree that small inflation spurs continual economic growth.  My point is that the earth has a limit to how much economic growth it can take.  I think it's time to switch gears and align ourselves with a new goal of not growth but general sustainment.  Replace old technology with new and better technology sure but not go for constant 5% growth year after year.  Population stabilization and perhaps a little contraction would be helpful as well.


True.  The depression (about a 10-year period) happened during that time period.  Notice how that 10 years accounts for a small percentage of the overall deflationary period?  If deflation causes depressions, why didn't we have a bunch throughout that huge deflationary time period?  Could it be that there could be other reasons for the depression?  Perhaps the bank runs and general financial system instability?


I don't see that in the graph


Your weakest point yet.  The graph shows major conflicts (civil war) and no out of control inflation until the gold standard was abandoned.  Wars clearly had no lasting effect.


Ok.  So the yen is great.  The Euro is doing fine.  The dollar is strong.  No debt issues anywhere.  Great news.


Real gold is sold all the time.  That's fine.  The paper gold market is tremendously larger than the real gold market.  That actually holds true for damn near any commodity.  In fact, derivatives in general (including futures contracts - paper gold) account for somewhere in the realm of 700 trillion dollars as compared to the sum GPD of all the countries (around 80 trillion).  That multiplier is very much in effect when it comes to paper gold verse real gold.  That larger number is what moves the markets and that's what matters.


Huh?  I'm saying that it's hard for me to buy goods from another country using gold.  It's easier to use a proxy for value.  Fiat money is one solution but, if fiat currencies begin to fail, we need something else.


Again, huh?  Bitcoin is indeed a form of international currency.  Yes it's created out of thin air.  Yes there are tons of crypocurrencies being developed that appear to be pump and dumps.  Lots of fiat currencies have been pumped and dumped in the past as well.  Just ask George Soros about him shorting the pound.
Again, it's not perfect.  You may not find value in Bitcoin.  You may find more value in pieces of paper printed at will by some authority.  You may find value in certain elements in the earth crust that look pretty.  Value is ultimately subjective.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
I completely understand anyone who thinks Bitcoin is a pump and dump and looks at any proponent as a greedy salesman.  I get that.  It takes a leap of faith to believe that some of us think this is the solution mankind has been waiting for and believe in its principles.

It is kind of a shame that we lost 96 bits (256-160) of address space in the final ripemd160 hash.  Technically, that increased the opportunity of someone to crack your account since there is more than one 256-bit private key that will have acceptable properties to spend your coins.  Still highly unlikely but kind of a bummer none the less.

Like several actions involving bitcoin, there are things large holders and miners can do that could hurt it somewhat but those actions also hurt them. In short, you'd lose a lot of money by dumping like that instead of a very gradual sell off.
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:45:38
Very cool idea. Unfortunately, at some point you do have to import the private key into a possibly compromised device to spend. This provides an opportunity for the virus to send the money elsewhere. 
With a hardware wallet like Trezor, the private key never leaves the device. I think that's the model of the future. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 00:07:51


Fair enough.  Most of our recent conversation was in the macro context so I extrapolated your point to trade deficits between countries.  I also thought that inflation encourages spending over saving.  Wasn't that your argument as to why we needed inflation?  Are internet debates inefficient or what...


Assuming that comes to pass, don't you find it interesting that it will economically viable to extract minerals from asteroids in our lifetimes?  I think that's a pretty good tell of a world economy that is growing too fast.  Exponential curves are hard to sustain.


Yup.  Emphasis on "had"


Statistically it should matter to you since most countries do keep some reserve of wealth in some type of dollar-denominated assets.  China, which you bring up next, is a great example.  They have been buying gold at a massive rate and yet they have something like 3 trillion of dollar-based assets.  Why would they be buying so much gold and trying to keep it as secretive as possible?  Clearly, to keep the price of gold as low as they can for as long as they can as they hedge against the dollar collapse.   Also, world trade is going to get complicated without a reserve currency possibly pushing the collective economy further into ruins as nobody knows where to go although they know they need to run from the dollar as fast as they can.
Perhaps the BRICS nations will come up with some sort of gold-based currency but that comes back down to trust - that gold isn't over leveraged in the vaults the way it always has been in the past.


I like that metric.  My access to milk, bread and other goods is getting more limited as the prices increase.  Hadn't had a McDonnald's cheeseburger in a couple of years.  Was shocked to see it at around $5 the other day.  I just googled it moments ago and found, coincidentally, that the big mac has been used as one small indicator to measure cpi.  [Here]( is one such article.  One interesting line:  "In 1998, the average price of a Big Mac was about $2.50. Today, the average Big Mac is $4.56. If we were using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the price of a Big Mac today should be about $3.40."
Anyhow, my access to goods sure is dwindling.  I'm pleased yours is improving.


Do you mean "due diligence"?  If so, I'd have to disagree (surprising, I know).  I've downloaded the code long ago and looked through it quite a bit (was a computer science guy in college before switching to mechanical engineering).  Because it is open source, I'm not sure what diligence is unavailable to one who wishes to make the time investment.  I've dived heavily into the elliptical curve signature algorithm as well as the underpinnings of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.  I understand the entire transaction structure as well as the block header and how the merkle tree allows scaling.  The Bitcoin address creation process is simple and elegant.  I've made many videos about how to use bitcoin (offline wallets, offline transactions, how scriptSig and scriptPubKey work, etc..).  All of it is beautiful.  Just an amazing work of engineering that continues to impress me the more I learn about it.  I'm not sure what other diligence I need to perform.


Sounds like an important concept there.  Would you please elaborate?  Kind of went over my head.
@_date: 2014-09-12 22:06:46


They are still at an economic disadvantage in the inflationary model since those with excess wealth can invest it and grow it.  All that changes between the two scenarios is where the investment goes - gamble in the stock market or save it in your pocket.


All those years of deflation in my previous graph (of which the depression was some 10% of the deflationary period) seemed to go just fine.  Recall that we have had plenty of recessionary years in this inflationary period as well.


Yikes.  If you don't think the dollar losing its reserve status will make your (American) life worse off, we might as well end the discussion right here.  No economist I have ever read has ever said anything remotely close to that.  Losing reserve status means countries no longer need it which means they will get rid of their reserves by buying American assets driving up American prices and flooding our borders with our currency which will lead to hyper inflation.  Whew...deep breath...  It would make Weimar look like a picnic.


That's true.  Trouble is that inflation is higher then government reports.  CPI isn't the greatest metric to measure inflation but it's not too bad.  The government keeps changing how it is even measured to underreport it - 20 times in 30 years - in order to reduce payouts to the beneficaries of social security and other programs.  [Here's]( one such study that uses the cpi method used during 1990.  Notice the difference in values.  There are other similar studies by various educational institutions around the country.  More by independent reviewers.  Hell, there's even that big mac comparison I mentioned a few posts back.  Prices are going up fast due to poor fiscal policy by the Federal Reserve.  Inflation is choking us.


Here's a table of annual inflation rate to net reduction of stored value over 10 years:
* 2% -&gt; 18.3%  (official number from Fed)
* 3% -&gt; 26.3%
* 4% -&gt; 33.5%
* 5% -&gt; 40.1%  (often sited truer number linked to actual money supply adjustment)
* 6% -&gt; 46.1%
* 7% -&gt; 61.6%
I'd say ~40% of a poor person's wealth is quite a hit.

I want to buy from you using bitcoin but it just doesn't make any sense.
Example: 5x 1oz maple leafs cost $6593.5 total which then results on your site as a bitcoin payment of 12.7964 ($515.26 / BTC).
If I try to buy back from coinbase to cover that loss of BTC (I always want to), I have to spend $6687.09 to do so.
It's $93.59 cheaper for me to just send a check and wait.  Coinbase says that their fee is $66.21 but their exchange rate is also higher at the time (517) so I lose there too.
Maybe if circle ever gets off the ground and the fees are zero as they advertise I'll start buying with bitcoin.

I have some savings but I also have a hot stash I replenish as I use it.  Best of both worlds.
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:58:05


That's where I take issue.  By being able to print your own money (no gold standard) you get the resulting inflation.  The final break from the gold standard was enacted by Nixon in 1971.  You can see on my first graph that that year is the inflection point of the consumer price index.  No deflation has ever been seen since.  


Don't think so.  My first graph shows many wars including the civil war.  Notice the deflationary periods after each.  Now that we are decoupled from gold, no more deflationary periods.


That's why every fiat currency is in trouble and talks of a global financial reset are growing.


Paper gold is always being bought and sold artificially driving the price low.  Real gold is moving in one direction in preparation for the next financial chapter of our species.  Trouble is, international trade is difficult with gold.  Would be nice if there was some sort of money-supply-controlled currency that could be sent over the internet instantly...

Trezor keeps your private key off the computer and uses it to sign transactions.  That's it.
So, your computer still makes a transaction.  In doing so, it can make a new change address and your change left over goes into that new address.  This is all completely up to your wallet software.
The trezor simply signs the transaction.

If I send you a "bitcoin", if you look behind the scenes at the code of the transaction, you'll see that I'm actually sending you 100,000,000 smaller units that are called satoshis.  Not much in the wiki page for it but [here you go]( if you want to see.


Yup.  That currently is one major school of thought - downward pressure on currency encourages spending or investing (gambling) to gain or maintain its value.  I would argue that this constant demand for spending and motivated consumption has led the world economy to a terrible point where we will see a financial collapse and a reversion to commodity-backed currencies side by side with bitcoin.  All countries are in incredible debt and nobody has a fix.  It's going to get very interesting very soon.


new monetary policy?  You mean the creation of the Fed which has controlled the money supply since 1913?  The policy that has devalued the dollar 98%?  The policy that requires debt ceiling raise after debt ceiling raise as the United States continues to spend far more than it earns?  Have a look at [this chart]( of debt to GDP.  We're falling off the cliff!  Countries are now working to replace the US dollar as the world reserve.  Gold is being purchased en masse by China, India, Russia, etc...  We're done and it's all the result of this monetary policy.

Sorry you're being downvoted, I really enjoy discussions done in good faith...


I think the main thing you're forgetting is that while bitcoins themselves are fairly scarce, satoshis are 100M times more plentiful and were intended to be the main currency the entire time.  2,500,000,000 satoshis are being created every 10 minutes so there's still a lot of opportunity to grab and use them.


The value should never decrease with time if it becomes a popular currency.  As you probably know, the bitcoin money supply is fixed to a maximum number so its value should increase over time.


Some of us who have researched the Fed and how it controls the supply of "Federal Reserve Notes" would take issue with this statement.  Before the Fed got involved, gold-backed US Dollars didn't decrease in value for many consecutive years.  Check out this [graph](

Two points / questions:
1: I wish the user could also supply entropy at startup like pressing the Trezor button multiple times and it counting the clock cycles between presses. 
2: if a highly skilled person found your Trezor, what obstacles are they up against in trying to extract the seed? I'm thinking about those shops that have access to those tools that allow them to override security features (read locks) in the chip using x-rays or something.

Would be interested to know if the two gpio pins the trezor wants dedicated to the buttons are unused on the bwallet. Since everything else works (display, USB,etc) I expect they are. It would be trivial to cut the original two traces and wire the buttons to the trezor-specified pins.
Moot point since I'm sure Rev 2 of bwallet will map 1:1 or someone else will make a pin-compatible version.

There are services that examine nodes all over the network to see if a double-spend transaction has been released.  If none are detected then the authentic transaction will have spread across the entire network before a later double-spend attempt can spread.
Only flaw left would be if the attacker controlled a large share of the hashing power and preferentially accept his double-spend transaction over the previous correct one all the other nodes have accepted.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:42:36

Excellent question.  Gavin is working on one possible solution that will allow the broadcast of a block header without its associated transactions under the assumption a node has most of the transactions that will already be in the block so they wont need to be sent.  Here's one [link]( that discusses this approach.
Gavin wrote something on it as well and you can find his link at the top of the link I gave above.
I don't think it would be a bad thing if the bitcoin core level wasn't insanely fast but was more reserved for $500 transactions or larger.  Smaller transactions could possibly still be handled by centralized companies on a higher layer like VISA is to the dollar today where you either recharge your account with them ahead of time (debit card model) or borrow from them and pay them back (credit card model).  Those are essentially "off-chain" transactions as they don't use the block-chain except for bulk reconciliations.

I think I've got the hang of it just fine.  I do, however, want to test the address first since bitaddress.org has had bugs in previous versions.
As you say, once you import the private key into an active bitcoin-qt installation or into blockchain.org to test it, you've made it an online address.
I'd simply like a utility that imports the private key and tells you the public key for it.  If that public key matches the public key bitaddress.org gave me, that's a good enough test for me.

I was able to verify the address using pywallet.py.

I understand.  Trouble is, I'd be using bitaddress.org to test itself which isn't helpful.  I'd like another separate program to do it so I can compare its output of the public key to bitaddress.org's output.  Make sense?

This one seems to work client side:
