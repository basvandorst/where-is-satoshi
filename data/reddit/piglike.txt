Ok i actually found a 12 word combination that was accepted as a passphrase... my heart almost stopped... but when i had recovered the wallet, it was empty, and was not the same public add as the 1 btc account. damn, back to the drawing board.

This is fun! i am lost looking at this image trying to figure it out.
I have noticed a few things that stands out \(Not sure if they have been mentioned before\):
\- There is a single "Y" next to an infinity symbol, this Y is the only "word" that is rotated to be upside down.
\- In the lower left corner there is the word "Theyre". The word "hes" is found inside the b of block, "Theyll" is found just above the word zero, "dont" is found inside the o in transaction and "cant" is found in the lower right corner. all of these are classical spelling errors and non of them are found in the whitepaper! maybe just a grammarnazi meme.
\- the numbers 1\-12 stands as single numbers, with 10 being the only number outside the circle
\- Close to the number one there is a "=\&gt;" this also does not exist in the whitepaper and looks like an arrow pointing to something. \(Could be pointing at "Try \+1, could this mean that the numbers refer to seedwords but 1 = 2, 2 = 3 etc? \)
\- in the top of the B there is 2 lines which could either be = or the roman numerals II.
\- There are words encircled within letters of other words ie. inside o's etc. This only occurs inside the circle.
\- The name John appears in the top, and is not in the whitepaper.
