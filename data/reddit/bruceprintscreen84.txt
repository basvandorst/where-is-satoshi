Know the feeling mate, first heard about it in 2013 but I didn't do proper DD on it at that time and quickly forgot about it and did not invest...very bad choice! I didn't even follow up the price action in the following years. Late August of this year(too late) I finally did proper DD and found out this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...Now where's my time machine!

We have seen 1K+ in 24 hours a few times now the last few weeks, with such Amazon news I would think it would be close to +3K in 24 hours or more.

Most people wouild go for save havens like gold in a stock market collapse but this time we have another new big asset(btc) to choose from when the collapse happens!

Can someone explain why and how BTC is a sponsor here? BTC is not a company. Who's the one paying the sponsor money?

Why would they pay to have the btc logo on the shirts instead of their own name and logo? It just makes no sense to me.

Well if you do the math 1% of 21 million coins is 210000 coins, if they bought at the very beginning when it was 0,10$ that would have been an investment of 'only' 21k(!) dollars. Let's say they bought in at 2$ it would have been a 420k investment. 
210000 x 6000$ = 1,260,000,000$
Mind boggling to say the least!
