Unfortunately, there is still not that much you can actually *do* with *just bitcoin*.  You can't pay for the kind of internet pipes they need to host their site.  You can't pay for high-end servers, for office space, for networking equipment.  And until you can pay for your daily expenses with *just bitcoin*, you can't pay your staff with it either.  Like I said, maybe some day, but it's going to be a while before it's practical, especially for a non-profit, to not convert most of their bitcoin earnings to fiat.

I thought part of the purpose of the checkpoints was to prevent far back-reaching selfish miner attacks.  So we are talking about the difference between preventing a hypothetical attack that ultimately achieves consensus, and an actual "attack" that has already achieved consensus.  I understand that it looks bad for the core devs to try to force a non-consensus decision on the network, but it has always been known that the protocol is subject to 50%+ attacks and honestly this sounds like another case of such an attack, where some consolidated bloc (e.g. a few Chinese miners) takes control.

While it doesn't neccessarily follow that an...overconfident...programmer is incompetent in other areas, the fact that he was rolling this stuff into production and presumably carried similar practices over into his financial services business is probably what cause the bitcoins to go missing.  Anyone who was following bitcoin early on knew that Mt Gox was riddled with security holes.

At least in the US, the tax breaks on that interest makes a huge difference in the first 15 or so years on a 30 year loan.  There are several maps out there that show whether it is better to rent or buy depending on area, that take all of these things into account.  The thing they don't account for, however, is that most people are quite bad at saving - so any extra money saved on renting will likely just get spent on frivolities.  Buying a house still makes sense for a lot of people despite the lackluster ROI in recent years and the interest payments.

This is a pretty lame article. Bitcoin already has checkpoints, what they are proposing is just to checkpoint a particular branch of the blockchain and call it official. This way the official client(s) will not get confused about which chain is the real one. I do picture little ones and zeros holding a gun to a block's header asking for proof of identity though...

Practically speaking, it's likely to be an issue with bitcoin as well.  I'm no fan of paypal, my wife was perma-banned years ago for no known reason and I know several people whose businesses have been damaged by Paypal freezing their funds due to an uptick in revenue.  If, however, you start moving a lot of fiat, which is what voat is going to ultimately want from most of its bitcoin donations, you are going to have to start providing a lot of documentation to ensure you don't violate AML laws or are generally not running a fraud/scam.  Paypal is probably asking for less documentation than Coinbase would in these circumstances.  Maybe bitcoin will some day solve this problem, but it's not going to happen any time soon.

You don't need changetip for that, it's just another (somewhat scammy IMO) product in the bitcoin ecosystem that makes one niche thing - tipping on social media sites - more convenient. It doesn't do anything particularly interesting that bitcoin itself doesn't already do, and just like with any other social media outlet, you are essentially their product by handing them a bunch of your personal information.

A perfectly valid point.  I know that I never think about .05 dogecoin, and for that matter probably never will.  But things have changed for bitcoin, and the software needs to change to address this.  The people who have been there from the beginning are an additional barrier to change, which is another common usability problem.
My point still stands that divisibility to 8 decimal places is simply not practical, if you are actually going to use all 8 of those places, which we in fact are doing now, quite heavily.

I seem to recall a game/auction theory result to the effect that bidding the true value you place on the item is a dominant strategy - that is, it's your best chance to win the item at a fair value. Due to this, you know that others are going to play this strategy. Serious question - why even bother bidding under market? The chances of winning are pretty much zero.

One would think the block reward is sufficient incentive.  The transaction fees are minimal, and including more transactions should yield more fees, so it seems counterintuitive to not include transactions in the block.  Additionally, improving the efficiency of the network is in everyone's best interest for the value of bitcoin.  It seems likely that this is either a misconfigured node or a bad actor.  If they are truly lacking in motivation there are a dozen alts out there they could probably pump and dump more profitably than mining bitcoin, if they are just in it for the money.

You'd need to know every address that Gox has ever used for this to be even vaguely accurate.  *They* obviously have the ability to do this, but that doesn't mean it will be easy to do let alone verify.  There is no doubt that they messed this up and have been doing so for quite some time -- even if they are thieves this reeks of incompetence.
(Re)balancing the books of an active trading firm, possibly over three years, sounds like a months-long endeavor by a team of trained professionals, even with the block chain and all keys.  Hence all the idle speculation going on here.  Just because it's a public ledger doesn't make it any easier to understand, and the sheer scale of the data probably makes it monumentally more difficult.
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:28:42
You can't even move that small an amount of BTC between addresses, due to the minimum txn fee. Similarly you are currently limited to a &gt;1 doge txn.
Besides I don't see what's wrong with giving someone 100 satoshi if the value goes up that much.  A satoshi is really the smallest indivisible unit that can show up on the block chain.

Oh hey, thanks for the reply.  I guess my biggest concern would be the overall surface exposure of the browser, generally. You are potentially dealing with other websites, browser plugins, etc., and with JavaScript being a garbage collected language, things like passwords can hang around in memory for an indeterminate amount of time.  This is in addition to the host of other standard issues involved with key transmission in any crypto system.  Are all the keys generated client-side and two are sent to the server over an SSL connection?  I don't know much of the details that go into multi-sig addresses, so my questions may reflect some ignorance on the subject.

Then what, exactly, can a 51% controlling node do that another cannot?  A good share of the original bitcoin paper deals with the 51% issue and how it relates to double-spending attacks just as described with Sally and George.  Who owns what amount of bitcoins is *entirely* determined by the blockchain and majority agreement over what that chain is.  Your private key gives you control over disbursements from your address but what is stored in that address is determined by the network.
EDIT: yes, the 51% attack is not ZOMG level automatically, but if a malicious player controls 51% there are going to be problems, and it will not necessarily be immediately apparent what, if anything, has gone wrong.

It's true, but insular snark aside, that's not really the point.  There is now a (even more) negative perception about bitcoin that the rabbi would rather not deal with.

Because it requires less effort to make a mistake than to prevent one?  I suspect that a good percentage of people who use bitcoin regularly will do something similar at least once, given enough time.  Non-reversible transactions do have some rather obvious drawbacks, this being one of them.  The ease of sending bitcoin can be an expensive convenience.

Not sure why you're being down voted, it is a very real possibility, and you are right about the early bitcoin community being similar. I do however think there are some important differences that may help to mitigate some of the ill effects.  First off, bitcoin has already been through the growing pains that does has gone through and has yet to face, so while there are many bumps ahead the community has a precedent to look upon. Dogecoin already has a ton of people focused on 'srs bsns', and it hasn't killed the community yet. It's already faced several pump and dumps and crashes and come out seemingly unscathed.  Time will tell, and the community will inevitably change over time, but overall I am bullish about its prospects.

Sorry, my point was that it's not going to be very obvious what this is, unless you know a fair amount about bitcoin already, and the penalty for not including it is pretty big for such an innocuous message.

Well, of course you could, but you'd need to cycle through all of them as blocks are found. It would kind of be impractical, so it does offer some greater amount of resistance than a single algorithm, or series of them like X11, which truly offers no greater advantage. But the bottom line is if you want to launch a 51% attack on myriad you'd just have to dominate 51% of each algorithm separately, which does not seem impossible at all.
Vertcoin's changing n-factor is another interesting take but even the devs realize it is not ASIC proof and will just switch algorithms to keep ahead of them. Which is probably the only sure way to do it, and is a sort of centralization of control in itself.

And yet, it was only a couple months ago that ghash.io nearly overtook 50% of the network.

Decentralization not hash power is more important, up to a point, and this is still an outstanding problem.

I'm often amused when investors talk about anything.  Usually it's all guesswork and hyperbole -- cargo cult investing.  "Company A has some attribute like Company B that made a fortune last month" is not very sound reasoning but most people simply aren't capable of dedicating the time and energy to go any deeper, advisors and analysts included.  Here, we see the same mentality blindly applied to something called "bitcoin" -- bad news means the value will go down, it's in the wind -- duh!  I've seen quite a few people bilked out of major mulah from traders at traditional investment firms with exactly this sort of reasoning.

It's just too attractive - why bother with investing millions of your own dollars to develop robust and integrated point of sale systems when you can throw together some php script and start an exchange that is practically guaranteed to turn a healthy profit overnight?

Thanks, I read this then re-read your original post and I think I see your point now.  It is true that Bob cannot say that Sally sent George 10 BTC instead of 5 due to the asymmetric encryption.  However it is possible that if Bob controls 51% he can send Sally 5 BTC, then double-back with an alternate chain that says he did not pay Sally at all but rather paid George, since he controls his own private key.  So he can't take funds that Sally already had, except perhaps by rewriting everything back to the beginning of the block chain.

Unfortunately at this current moment all of my paycheck goes to mortgage, daycare, and various living expenses, only the latter of which can be paid in bitcoin, and then only a very small, niche fraction.  It would be a ton of extra work to be pain in bitcoin, and would not be worth it with the varying exchange rates -- predictability for living expenses is worth a lot.  I think it's pretty cool that it works for some people, but "someday" is a long ways off, methinks.
This article was painfully light on details.  The company does not have a traditional bank account?  How do *they* deal with tax withholding, etc.?  Are their employees living in a tax limbo when they exchange btc for fiat to cover expenses?  I'd be genuinely curious to know more about how this actually works.

I see little incentive for them to reform. Graphics card manufacturers are making general computing devices that do things other than mine crypto currencies. They have many and varied incentives.

I don't think it's quite that simple.  There's also the factor of the bitcoin developers, who are arguably the most technically competent of the bunch, and overall there is a greater braintrust behind BTC than any of the altcoins.  So the altcoins' future is still tied in a very real way to BTC.  It is certainly possible that a new coin will actually overtake bitcoin but it hasn't happened yet and doesn't look like it will in the near future.
There are also now heavily monied interests behind bitcoin that will fight to keep it the premier cryptocurrency, and in this sense it's no different than fiat.  The irony of the altcoins threatening bitcoin seems to be lost on many...
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:10:35
I agree that "bits" is problematic, but I'm not sure of a better name that anyone will get behind.  
The decimal place *was* put there by Satoshi, because the basic unit of measure, 1 bitcoin, is divisible to 8 decimal places.  It was good enough for initial use and for several years thereafter, but the wallet is more of a p2p client than a, well, *wallet*, and this is one of the smaller issues with the core client IMO.  I think it's safe to say that Satoshi had a good idea, put it into practice in the simplest way possible, and since he didn't have a pressing need to revisit it, here we are now.  But it was a weird decision to make the currency divisible to this extent, why would you do that if you didn't plan on it being used, and if you planned on it being used, why make it so bloody difficult to reason about?  Again, a common problem with software development, particularly OSS, likewise with research-grade development, both of which bitcoin has qualified as until recently.

And if you're always stoned...
Cannabis has a long list of 'negative' side effects.  Like with any drug, they don't affect everyone, possibly not even the majority, but if you look at e.g. pain medication the most common complaint is that it leaves people feeling stoned, drowsy, like they can't do anything.  The side effects of weed are much more pronounced.   
Anecdotally, I smoked regularly for several years and the stopping point was the utter lack of motivation while smoking.  I was like "I'm going to get stoned and do X today!" and instead I'd just get stoned.  For a while this had worked great, I'd get stoned and do X and felt very motivated, but after a while it really felt like it was just sapping my energy.  YMMV.

It's sad that he got caught, I don't disagree with what he was doing on a moral stance, but I also don't believe that he should somehow get a free ride if he is found guilty.
I think the case honestly has very little impact on bitcoin's future. It may set precedent of bitcoins being money in the case of government seizure of property, but I don't see how that's terribly relevant to anything on a day to day basis.  Bitcoin is already treated as money for e.g. KYC and AML regulations, I don't really understand what people think is on the line here for bitcoin.  All the privacy and other issues are really independent of btc.

It has happened before for fiat currencies, Mexico did this by dropping 3 decimal places and issuing new banknotes for the peso. Sometimes you would still come across an old 100,000 peso note and do a double take. Of course, this was due to inflation not deflation and went in the opposite direction from bitcoin, but it did help solve the perceptual issue of the peso being totally worthless.

I agree, but at some point you are left with centralization as the only viable option.  You can introduce more localized centralization via something like payment channels/lightning network, but at some point it's still going to come back to the blockchain or you throw out bitcoin altogether.  So it's really a question of *how well* you can make bitcoin scale and the tradeoff between network capacity and hardware costs, and to some extent investment in blockchain R&amp;D which is totally not where the money is flowing.  While more creative solutions will inevitably be required, if we can't continue to expand network capacity I don't think that using bitcoins as an everyday currency is a realizable goal.

I fail to see any way in which this plan is viable, at least as posited here, and I call BS on their speculation. They would probably have to supply some extra hardware to connect the devices to the Internet, and the margins are just too slim on mining hardware to start throwing in a free toaster and a 25% cut back to the customer.  The fact that your toaster will be obsolete mining equipment in three months lends it even less credence.

If you really want to learn about mining by doing it, you should know up front that it can become an expensive habit and you will *not* make any money doing it.  There is the chance that you mine some coins and the value skyrockets but even if that happens, if you are looking to sink anything more than a few bucks into bitcoin, you will *always* end up with more coin for your buck by just buying the coins.
Back to your question, since I have learned a ton from mining and think it's worthwhile to fool around with, just not to sink much money in.  You can generally pick up used miners off amazon.  I wouldn't spend more than $100.  A single miner won't use much power.  But it's not very much fun to mine for a month and end up with .01 bitcoins for your effort, which is pretty much what you can expect for that investment.  If you just want to get your feet wet and learn, I'd mine an altcoin with your existing computer and not spend anything.  You can mine DRK and XMR on a desktop PC, CPU only, or GPU if you have a decent graphics card.  You can do it on a laptop if you really must but I wouldn't leave it running long-term or you risk damaging your laptop, they do not dissipate the heat from mining nearly as well as a large case with fans.  Whatever you make from the alts you can then sell on an exchange for bitcoin, if you want BTC.  You will also make considerably more BTC doing it this way than mining BTC directly.  Good luck :/

It's easy to mess up a calculation like this when you have to do it all the time in subtly different contexts, even for those of us who deal with science and technology on a daily basis.  Humans just aren't that good at arithmetic, period.
Plus it's not really dividing by 1000 that's the issue.  We're talking about 8 decimal places with no separators.  It's like we've thrown out 10000 years of usability in dealing with large numbers and are just using whatever is easiest for the programmer.  Typical problem in the world of OSS development, but for widespread use, totally unacceptable.  Needs to go to 100 satoshi as the basic unit of measure, divisibility by 100 is both easy to reckon with and familiar.

What Bitcoin does not need is another bubble. It would be incredibly reassuring to see small steady increases in price as real world usage grows. This is what will draw real money after the fact.

The point of regulation would be to make it so that this could not have happened in the first place.  Responsible reporting, more stringent up-front requirements to run an exchange, public audits, etc., *may* have caught Gox out before they were so deep into their current situation and allowed regulators to step in and limit the damage.  Of course this is in an ideal world and my personal experience with regulators in the US is that they are little more than crooks who line their own pockets but whatever, I'm not entirely against it on principle.  At any rate, now that it's over and done with, Mt. Gox are just as criminally liable as they would have been with or without regulations.

The prevailing attitude in this thread hurts my brain.  is fundamentally correct.  Whining about their dominance is not going to solve anything.  Mutual agreement by pools and others to cap their hashrate is only putting a very flimsy band-aid on the problem.  How many times has bitcoin already been through this?  Not to mention LTC who just went through the same scenario with coinotron.  It could be a bad actor that comes along next time.  GHash could actually be or could turn into a bad actor.  Then the agreements to cap hashrate will be worth absolutely nothing.
Either 51% control by a single node is a problem worthy of a technical solution and an eventual hard fork, or we should just live with the status quo without all the vitriol.  The network is not going to fold in the next few months while a solution is being implemented and tested, but all we are likely to get is a community paralyzed by fear and greed and no forward progress.  If the community leaders don't come forward in favor of some actual solution to the problem, we will all be here again in six months, I guarantee it.

I'm with you - I'd love to see the big banks taken down a couple notches and held accountable for their illegal actions, but I simply don't see bitcoin playing a major role.  People in here seem to want banks to go away - but it's cheap and easy credit which has brought us through the industrial revolution and into the information age.  If you want a good picture of what a society without credit looks like, have a glance at the Middle East.  To points,
1. There's nothing that prevents people from creating secondary instruments off bitcoin.  See, for example, the altcoin explosion, and derivitaves markets.  Slavish adherence to an arbitrary and inflexible monetary distribution policy is only going to create its own set of problems, and I'm willing to bet they are more severe than those created by a stable and affluent government creating money by fiat.  It may eventually be more viable for citizens of some small, unstable, third-world governments, much as gold is now.
2. The openness of bitcoin as a ledger and its utility for audits is highly questionable.  The currently-prescribed best practice is to avoid address re-use.  It is pseudonymous bordering on anonymous.  It is in fact a complete mess on this particular point, and options like darkwallet only add to the problem.  You can't have it both ways and bitcoin, at the moment, has it neither way.
3. This is the only point that I think is really viable, but the level to which bitcoin must first scale is currently out of the question.  We are already talking about payment channels and other centralized services to handle any real volume on the network.  Remains to be seen if long term, bitcoin can become a real player in the world financial system, and if it does, whether we actually rely more heavily on the blockchain or some intermediary like, I dunno, a bank.

You certainly have a lot of faith in the process.  I know people who work for the patent office and it is a very straightforward affair.  There is very little room for research or decision making.  You examine the claims, determine if that particular set of claims is unique to this patent compared to those existing in the patent database, and if it is, grant the patent.  That's effectively what counts as prior art, and the examiners follow a very strict rubric with a huge backlog of work and constant pressure to just keep moving forward.  The office has made a push to hire more people with domain expertise who will hopefully be able to better determine if there is *actually* prior art in the wild and if the patent is *truly* non-obvious, but that big a ship doesn't turn on a dime and the rate of employee turnover in the government is extremely low.

What possible incentive does reddit have to let users get paid directly through the site, *in bitcoins*, as opposed to gilding a user?  I'm sure they don't perceive something like changetip as a big threat to reddit gold, it's cumbersome and intrusive and because of this you end up looking like a zealot when you go tipping a bunch of people, you get banned from some subs, etc.  Direct user-to-user BTC payments through reddit would be huge but I don't think that will ever happen.

I don't think that some people here realize how much the altcoin ecosystem has brought people to bitcoin, and how much their downfall may in turn disenfranchise many smaller (or even not so small) investors.  Sounds like a Pyrrhic victory to me, litecoin was never a threat to bitcoin, nor was it intended to be.  If all you can see in bitcoin is the price, you're going to have a bad time.

The consumer does not generally actually lose the dollars in any of those scenarios (except perhaps the scammer one).  Transactions are reversible and the institutions backing the dollar are willing to take the occasional loss for the sake of additional consumer protections, realizing that some things like trust in the system are more important than a few extra dollars profit at the end of the quarter.  It's not exactly easy to give dollars to the wrong person by accident, because CC transactions are (essentially) pull transactions not push.  Not saying these things don't have their own drawbacks, but you don't see Yellen saying to avoid dollars.

My impression was that the device itself was intended to be a loss-leader.  For bitcoin mining.  Which is not really profitable for any but the chip manufacturers to begin with.  They are offsetting the electricity costs to the customer but this is hugely discounted by the cost of embedding ASICs into household devices.  They may have found some way to make this theoretically come out in the black but it's not a 100mm business.
Another point against it is that mining hardware is finicky.  It generates a ton of heat which can cause problems with the device itself if not dissipated properly.  Miners freeze up and need reboots, they overheat continually and need reapplication of thermal paste, the boards go bad, the chips go bad, etc., etc.  There are big noisy fans that push the heat out of the device - probably not enough for a space heater, but enough to be annoying.  Perhaps the later generations have gotten better, but I'm still skeptical.

You know, I had several epiphanies when I was first really digging into how bitcoin worked, but there was one moment in particular which I think stood out above the others, and to sum it up my realization was that bitcoin is like online cash.  That's pretty much it.  Direct payments without a middle man, without the potential ban of services like PayPal (my wife was banned years ago for unknown reasons and can never use their services again), without the CC company tracking every purchase I make.  Easy to carry, tricky to secure but unlikely to be stolen if you pay attention to the basics.  No visions of the downfall of world governments, of libertarian or anarchist utopias, no delusions about personal wealth beyond my wildest dreams.  
This was some time ago and I still think the analogy is pretty good as it stands and doesn't need much adornment.  How often do you use cash?  Occasionally you need it for some stuff, some people use it a lot, but most of us increasingly use a debit card or credit.  For the foreseeable future, bitcoin may as well be a highly volatile form of USD (or whatever your local currency is), because much like USD in order to get it I have to go to my bank or an ATM, effectively plug in my banking information, and out comes cash, which I'll more or less spend right away and be done with it.  Bitcoin is an excellent digital analog (hah) for cash used in this manner, and I think that down the road there will be a place for it.  
What it will actually be used for aside from DNM purchases remains to be determined.  Perhaps long-term there is the potential as a store of value, if you don't mind your value fluctuating wildly and unpredictably.  It will take a good deal more time before I trust it for that, though.
You don't have to drink the whole jug of kool-aid to know what the stuff tastes like;)

Agreed, the massive number of problems in the broader bitcoin community should be swept under the rug.  /s
This is the beauty of a decentralized, unregulated system - it's largely up to the community to regulate itself, and that regulation depends on information.  People naturally gravitate toward negative information, it's an evolutionary trait to be on the lookout for danger and respond to it, even if disproportionately.  Moreover, while there are many drawbacks to deregulation, it does have certain advantages.  The banks really did screw a lot of people over in the last (and in some places, still-ongoing) crisis, and many had an unreasonable expectation of safety due to the checks and balances in place, which largely failed.  I have practically no expectation of safety when it comes to bitcoin - I'm reasonably confident that the core and electrum wallets are solid, and the protocol not subject to exploitation, and that's about it.
If only a few clueless people see this negative press, they will be better off, and the community will, as a result, be stronger as a whole.  It does sometimes get tiresome though, you hear about one scam after another and people just keep falling for the new ones.  But, how else do you propose handling these situations?  If there's no public outcry, it seems there is *no chance* of the situation improving.

The reasons we no longer use gold as a currency are mostly the same reasons Bitcoin is a poor currency. Ultimately the government fixed the price of gold to attempt to stabilize currency exchange. Bitcoin scarcity is not a strong guarantee, just look at BCH, and the upcoming fork in November.
It is something of an open question as to what exactly props up the Bitcoin price. The market forces are necessarily obscure due to the nature of the platform. The dark nets are certainly a factor that keep up demand, but I don't think they necessarily drive price. Speculation seems to be the most common reason to trade Bitcoin and that will always swing wildly.

I'm not saying it's not a problem, but that's hardly a justification for piracy.  *Some* of the money goes to the artist, and if enough people buy it, that adds up to a lot of money.  It's not like the studios, production companies, advertising agencies, and all the rest in the chain do nothing at all and their employees don't deserve *any* remuneration for their efforts, either.
Piracy may even help some artists by getting their name out more, but any more with so many legit services out there for self-promotion I highly doubt that is the case.
Want to fight back against the system?  Don't consume the crap it produces, pirated or otherwise.


What on earth does this have to do with bitcoin?  I think it's great that artists can do this kind of thing but there's no reason they can't accept credit cards and it will work just as well.

There is nothing to stop them from detecting that - if your coins keep ending up on backpage through some traceable channel I would imagine they just close your account.  You're probably going to have to launder them through exchanges and tumblers unfortunately.

Even if it doesn't, you say you have no coins, then suddenly you spend some. How does he government know?

It effects everyone, the miners just happen to be at fault for not validating blocks before adding new ones to the chain.  So if you take payments in bitcoin, you need to wait 30+ blocks.  If you just want to play around with bitcoin then there's not inherently any problem, just be aware that sending them anywhere - like an exchange, a gambling site, etc. - just became a lot slower a process due to the current situation.

Even if their backups were in tact, it may have simply been cheaper and more reliable to pay the ransom. Have you ever tried to restore even a small enterprise from backup? It could take hours or days to get back up and running and even longer to be fully operational. You may never fully recover some things. Worst case scenario if they pay the ransom is that they are out a measly $17k and have to do this anyway. Best case, they are back up and running in relatively short order.

The decrease in inflation may attract a new breed of investor, but not, I think, in any great number unless the price fluctuations decrease first.  And if the 11% inflation rate is not the primary driver of price fluctuation now, I'm not sure what else exactly will change by next year.  It's a chicken and egg problem at this point.  There is still not one good real-world use that is exclusively tied to bitcoin except for the dark markets.  As the early investors' spendable funds continue to peter out, what will keep bitcoin afloat?  I don't think it's likely to go to $0 due to some flaw, but it could continue to slowly contract as new speculators fail to see any ROI.  The enormous efficiencies gained through centralized systems will continue to make bitcoin come in second place on almost all fronts.  The marketplace for digital goods is still dominated by CC transactions and not without good reason.  The blockchain is an awesome technology but *where does the real-world value come from* except speculation?  There is a price floor due to mining and consistent use in dark markets.  I don't think we've hit it yet.  Once the speculators have mostly lost interest and the technology has had more time to mature, *then* I think we stand a chance to see a new breed of investors start picking it up.  How long will this take?  It's too far out to predict, but not in the far-distant future.  Three to five years is entirely possible.  More would not surprise me.
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:12:35
So why even use bitcoin then?  From the user's standpoint, it's now no different than those other cards.  From the card vendor's standpoint, now they have to keep their own internal ledger *and* deal with bitcoin exchanges to avoid taking the hit for price fluctionations themselves.
Selling bitUSD or some other form of pegged asset would make more sense, but I don't think the adoption or even the technology is necessarily there yet.  Bottom line is, this type of thing probably *is* what's needed for average joe adoption, and it's still *way too early* for it.

Anything that has any value will attract crime.  I think there's a lot of cool stuff in bitcoin, and long-term I think there's a place for it at the table, but some of the more humorous aspects come from watching the throes of a completely unregulated market, based around an emerging technology, all the while with rabid ancaps cheering it on.  This entire thread is an excellent example: not everyone who criticizes the stuff that goes on in this sub is anti-bitcoin.  Many buttcoiners are also bitcoiners, there's a lot to poke fun at.  There's a world of difference between trolls and honest critics, and this sub seems to have a particular problem with telling the two apart.  Good times!

This is not a very good article.  No mention of the many hurdles this would face to even become vaguely close to feasible.  Most notably, you would need a special agreement with your ISP to resell their bandwidth, and with ISPs already throttling traffic upstream, exactly what kind of service are you purchasing with your bitcoins?  Reddit's former cryptocurrency engineer was just on here a couple weeks ago touting a bandwidth purchasing plan just like this and it had nothing to do with net neutrality.  Turns out the idea has been around since the 90s and has long been infeasible for reasons having nothing to do with the payment channel.

The number of people who care about porn quality to that extent is vanishingly small. It seems to me that there's more decent-quality free porn out there than you could watch in a lifetime.  If you want a live experience on a cam site or similar, then sure, Bitcoin seems like it may be a good fit. The problem now is that the number of people with Bitcoin who are willing to spend it is also quite small.  So what are you going to do, sign up with a new financial institution like Coinbase, wait a while for money to transfer, send them tons of info for AML requirements, and then effectively pre-pay for the service by buying X amount of coins in advance? Are you going to arrange a meeting with someone on localbitcoins and go meet them in person and risk personal assault or getting ripped off to again prepay for porn tokens? Or are you just going to pay the site via a financial institution with whom you already have a long-standing relationship and who will authorize a payment immediately?  The billing is discrete and your ISP knows about your activity so it's not like privacy is a huge issue with the payment method. Seriously it's a no-brainer, it's not like porn sites are just universally unaware of Bitcoin.
