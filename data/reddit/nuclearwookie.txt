I would assume. I wouldn't think there's much danger of the Romney camp ponying up the money to and hoping the blackmailer actually deletes the documents when he can just post them anyway. I assumed the real targets were Obama supporters that might kick in $10 or $20 each to some fund like this. It's actually a brilliant mixture of old-fashioned blackmail, modern partisan politics, anonymous cybercurrency, and grass-roots fundraising

The UN also thinks that the right not to be religiously offended is a basic human right. Luckily, the UN has no power whatsoever. 
Even so, this has nothing to do with bitcoin. At all.
And even considering that this has nothing to do with bitcoin, interference by government is not a major concern from speculators since it can be completely invisible to government if the right precautions are taken. Hence its use as a currency for drug purchases. As someone that has considered speculating $25k in bitcoin briefly, I'd let you know that in the list of turn-offs government meddling was at the bottom of the list. At the top of the list was the possibility of someone figuring out that this is a fiat currency backed by nothing at all and causing it to collapse.

Generally Bitcoins are used by people that have an antagonistic relationship with the state. Do you want to spend your money on something forbidden by society? Bitcoins are the way to go. Do you want to transfer money to an organization hated by governments without getting yourself on a watchlist? Bitcoins allow the anonymous transfer of wealth. Do you want to play money markets and invest in a risky venture, all without paying taxes on your profits? Bitcoins are perfect.
To summarize: people that don't like to pay taxes, who think Wikilieaks is a good thing, or who want to buy drugs despite the protests of the nanny state will be drawn to Bitcoin, hence the large proportion of libertarian types.

And that's why they're misguided. The state will inevitably be used for harmful actions since the state, at its best, is governed by the will of the majority of the population. At its worst the state is run by a small group of people or even one man, and then the results are even worse. Leftists want a strong state, which maximizes the amount of damage that is inevitably done.

If he was legit he would have left a hash of important numbers in the return so that the authenticity of the claim could be verified by the people he's blackmailing.

Really? It doesn't seem very efficient to me, it seems like a pain in the ass. You have to take real money, send it to Japan, turn that into bitcoins, and then go through the transaction in the unlikely case that the merchant accepts it at all. Bitcoin's strength is in its anonymity, not its ease of use.

Why? Buying and selling Bitcoins incurs a significant transaction cost, so it hardly makes sense to use them for any purpose that doesn't require anonymity. 
@_date: 2012-07-07 22:48:44
Only people that are currently holding bitcoin or running a business based on bitcoin have an interest in maintaining the value of bitcoin. What makes bitcoins valuable and the competing cryptocurrencies worthless? The userbase and economy. But those can desert you very quickly. Myspace went from being valued at $580 million to $35 million when someone built a better social network.
@_date: 2012-10-27 19:52:02
Much. I know everyone on here is a big Bitcoin booster and all, but in the current situation getting money into and out of Bitcoin involves significant transaction costs, uncertainty, and delay. Paying with Bitcoin for an in-person transaction might not be feasible since it takes hours for the transaction to be fully accepted into the blockchain.
As with any less-than-ideal currency, it's applications will be limited to where it is needed. For all purposes but blackmail and the purchase of illegal goods, regular currency has a significant advantage over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-07-07 22:55:00
And you're of course free to do so. I'm just saying that I wouldn't want to have funds denominated in bitcoin at this point because it hasn't reached a critical mass that would be immune to a panicked sell-off that destroys it overnight.
@_date: 2012-10-21 11:45:10
There is still the important bit about not being able to spend Bitcoins on local goods or staples. And not getting paid in them. And the overhead with turning dollars to Bitcoins. And the instability. Oh yeah, and the fact that the government could easily stop our ability to transfer dollars to and from MTGOX if it ever felt like it.
Those are all pretty good reasons. I know, Reddit is prone to mindless boosterism but use your fucking brain.

Yeah, it does. Investors provide the capital that enables companies to exist in the first place. Joe Sixpack wouldn't be able to get on Facebook or buy a television if investors weren't there to provide capital to companies.


How does that help Joe Sixpack?


Of course it does. Hundreds of millions of people invest in the stock market, either actively or through their retirement funds. Anyone playing in the market, and that's the majority of the population, has on average won in the recent years. 
Beyond the individual wealth of people rising, let's not forget that the money they make is taxed, and that money definitely does count as "trickling down". It's not their fault the government wastes most of it.


It creates a business. That business employs people and will pay large amounts in tax revenue. 


Why would you try to convince them to do that? Also, you might be missing something important when it comes to the basic definition of the word "investment" if you think it can be done without the goal of a profit or ROI.


"Happily depart from their principle" is the cutest euphemism of the confiscation of wealth I've heard of in a long time. Who says that a function of government is to steal the money of the rich?

Unless you're an early adopter sitting on a recent fortune of old Bitcoins, why would you want to pay for a legitimate product with them, particularly when you they don't provide any anonymity since they're **tied to your Steam account**? Turning USD to BTC costs money, and it would only make the games  you buy more expensive than they would be otherwise.
The alternative would be to start a new, "anonymous" Steam account. But Valve doesn't want that sort of business because anyone needing that sort of anonymity is likely to be a scammer or set to otherwise abuse their system.

Despite what the others are saying, I think you made a good move.

None of those states were anywhere near communism. They were socialist: a strong state owned the means of production.

Why not? Time and again it has been demonstrated that there are no checks in place to keep our tax money from being used against us. The only reasonable solution would be to reduce taxes to the point where the system isn't worthwhile to abuse.


So you're a slave for the rest of your life and must accept everything government chooses to do with your tax dollars?


I would think that charity and non-profits would continue to exist. Unlike the other guy, I don't think taxes are automatically evil, I just think they should be done at the lowest level possible. You could continue to fund public school with local taxes without having to send the money through DC.


So corporations aren't dodging taxes and that was just bullshit you made up? As long as they're following the letter of the law when it comes to taxes you have no room to complain.


And why shouldn't they do that? It's legal, it's in their interest, and it deprives our evil government of the money it needs to do evil things.
