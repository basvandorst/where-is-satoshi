GPU mining zcash (not bitcoin) on slush is the only option you have for slush.  otherwise, stick with zpool.  you're already earning, keep it up! :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:50:31
It can't hurt either.
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:05:26
Yes, I guess I am trying to figure out if there is or could ever be a relation.  If the price of bitcoin goes up dramatically, will the market eventually adjust to meet a fair price to move coins?  I think it will.  I think the average tx weight fee will go down as profitability goes up but I'm really not sure. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:00:08
(I'm working with average fees here, not saying that a 1k tx is going to cost 25000 sats in total).
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:37:39
slush for zcash you mean?  you can use awesome miner with slush mining zcash. 
You cannot mine bitcoin with GPU's effectively.  you are probably better off staying with zpool.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:58:53
Am I correct in assuming that the fee to move bitcoin used to be higher than 25000 sats?  If that's so then the price of the fee per satoshi has gone down.  I seem to remember paying more satoshis for a TX back in the day.

I'd like to nominate The Attic Youth Center, a LGBTQ youth organization in Philadelphia that has been serving the community for more than 20 years.  When I was young, they were there for me and I'd sincerely appreciate if you could start them out with some bitcoin. We added the bitcoin address to their donation page as I recently got them started accepting bitcoin donations. I really appreciate anything you can offer them.

As far as his comment, he was "making a joke" as he stated in his email reply.
Thank you for bringing this to my attention. 
I was simply rebuking the empty chat room accusations, as always, with a humorous slant. 
Your feelings that I am emotionally unstable are unfounded, I believe you are exhausted and should take some rest. 
Your insinuation that I am unstable, speak more loudly of your own incapabilities. 
Please sleep well, and take the time to reflect on the work you need to do to stop fostering bad opinions of others. 
If you wish to pursue the matter further, your message will be forwarded to another team member, but I am unable to guarantee they will take any sympathy with your beliefs. 
Let me know if you are still needing help with this question. 
Best Regards,
CEX.IO Support

I've already pulled off my hardware and sold all GHS.  I'm removing my funds ASAP.  They have also been mining DRK with no wallet - no way to withdraw DRK funds.  They owe a lot of people a lot of DRK coin at this point.

I use a trezor and it has been power cycled.  Interesting.  I guess we'll see what happens

UPDATE:  Still not confirmed and has been appearing and disappearing from my wallet for the last week.  This morning I finally decided to do a new transaction with a higher fee.  Half the network sees the new TX, half the network, the old.  So what's going to happen?  Any insight?

How is that safe for a merchant?  What if the memory pool is so full that even normal fees drop off the mempool?  It has only been like 4 days.

It'd have been really nice if you'd have started by saying something like this instead of insisting that I must go search around and read thousands of other conversations instead of opening up my own dialogue.  I've already made statements in other comments under this thread.  Reply to them if you are interested in discussing this further.

Very, I also posted about it.
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:37:44
Here's how I see it.  2mb vs 1mb isn't going to break the storage bank in the coming future.  If TX's are processed faster and more can be pushed through at a time with 2mb blocks, that seems like a logical step.  I don't understand what the fuss is all about.  Block size should always be large enough to accommodate the network.  Right?  What's the fear?  Attack?  I'm really trying to work through this and figure it out.
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:54:21
I don't think a hard fork is that big of a risk.  I can't account for bandwidth but considering the tiny size we're talking about, 2mb every 10 minutes on average seems like next to nothing.

@_date: 2017-07-20 21:25:48
only observational evidence based on the block shape and timing.  3 blocks within 6 seconds.  one block with zero tx's when the mempool is full.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:19:58
I'm pretty sure 2-8mb will be just fine at least for the next 10 years bitcoin is viable.

Context seems to be lost on you, eh?  Why not answer my question.  I'm a miner and I don't believe 2mb vs 1mb is much of a difference.  If you do, tell me why.
