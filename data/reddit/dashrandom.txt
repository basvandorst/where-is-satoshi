This. And no UPS is pure cringe.

Surge protection does what it's name says -  protect against surges, not against dips or fluctuations in voltage / current. I already claim to not be an expert in mining and ASICs, I don't know how these fluctuations will affect ASICs. Maybe it won't. It sure affected enterprise grade server equipment though, repeatedly shutting down unexpectedly and took us 4 weeks working with the vendor to trace the cause to faulty wiring.

Sure, whatever you say. There's a common misunderstanding that UPSes are only for electrical outages but this is incorrect. It's for surge protection, current / voltage fluctuations and a whole lot of other things that could be the result of degraded/old/bad wiring or electrical set up. I'm not a mining expert but experience in the data centre tells me UPSes are must have because they usually warn about forecoming issues. I've had a server repeatedly go down at random intervals when our ups battery was dead because of voltage fluctuation (old wiring).  Took us weeks to pinpoint the issue. It's entirely up to you because it's your business and not mine and I have nothing to lose anyway.

I never said this server was in the main site. Nice assumptions. Any more you'd like to make?

Thank you sir, your reply is a thousand times more comprehensive than OP's.

Correct. Charitable organizations need to show that they are receiving 'donations' and that are not making people pay for a service or product.

Guys, sorry to burst your bubble but as an subscriber as well, I can tell you with 99% confidence this is probably bull. 
IBTimes is well known for publishing anything they can get their hands on. They are not a reliable source for **anything**.

~~You have Google chrome open to the blockchain.info page, "HUAWEI MODEM 3.5" application open, and TightVNC server indicating it is being used, I am **100% positive** you are offine.~~
~~Next time, try actually appearing offline.~~
My bad, I just read you have another machine.

You're an idiot and I hope you lose all your bitcoins because you deserve it. 
When people out of concern and good will tell you to do something, **listen**. Thank them. Don't call them names and be dismissive. Even if you don't end up heeding their advice.
