Bad idea to give your office mates investment advice, much less speculation. If it goes up and they buy in you get none of the thanks, if it tanks you get all the blame; otherwise it's I told you so during dips, and I hate you more during rallies.
Generally be hush-hush, I only ever discuss with immediate family, and it's generally on how best to spread tax burdens and divest gains.

He still drives to work every day and sets out exact change before, either: $3.17, $2.61, or $2.95.






I think you can learn a lot more from that than the above quote. 
In one word, discipline.

Trust me when I say I would love to be wrong on this point, but if you are proceeding anyway then have fun arguing that in an audit (I've been through one, it was so much fun).
It's important to take in context that 1031 qualification is the *exception* rather than the rule, and the burden will be on you to prove that you have it on authoritative source that it qualifies (**saying that an exception to the rule applies to crypto because the IRS  did not not call it an exception is not "substantial authority"**), this is assuming you are even doing careful form 8824 reporting this year.
Like kind exchange is *only* for *qualified* property, it's the exception not the rule. 2018 law makes it explicit that it does not apply to crypto, and guidance before was implicit. 
*edit: read this, explains better than I can:

Wow, only a month, certainly puts it in perspective. Feels like 10 years when you day trade coins.

Comes down to two simple points: 1. governments want to monitor and control capital inflow/outflows; and 2. collect taxes. Anonymity ban on the exchange level is going to go in everywhere.

Did you even read the guidance you linked? 
You are clearly wrong, and that is exactly what the IRS guidance says.
Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for 
other property? 

A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency 
exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable 
gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less 
than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency. See Publication 544, Sales and Other 
Dispositions of Assets, for information about the tax treatment of sales and exchanges, 
such as whether a loss is deductible.
Q-1: How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes? 

A-1: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property.

Recommend to add a section for quarterly estimate tax paying to avoid penalties (or increase withholding) -- pay minimum 90% current year or 100% previous year, since the US is a pay as you earn system q/q.
A lot of folks made substantial amounts as short term cap 2017 so this is relevant
Also if you file by 1/31/18 you can avoid filing a q4 estimate.

Gold isn't intended as a gain, it's a hedge for when the entire world goes to shit (all capital asset classes, bonds, equities, and yes crypto collapse... when countries go to war, viral contagions spread, natural disasters sweep global regions, EMP bombs hit AntPool, DiscusFish, BitFury, and BTC China Pool at the same time, etc. gold has survived the past 4 thousand years).
