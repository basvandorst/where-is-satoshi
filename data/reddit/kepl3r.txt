Satoshi is an AI and it’s ‘DNA’ is being stored in the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:17:24
I’ll give it a read and see if it changes my mind. I’m very interested in how the sanctity of the blockchain can be assured in a PoS system.

It’s insured on coinbase. Someone steals it you at least get the current value back. 
Lose your hardware wallet and your SOL unless you have one with a pass phrase. Write down a pass phrase and now you’ve got a key you can lose and that needs to be protected. 
I’m not advocating to keep money on an exchange, but there is a definite trade off. It’s not as simple as some people try to make it sound. 
Source: stored key on USB drive prior to hardware wallets being a thing. USB drive failed. I’m out .1 BTC with no recourse. 
Edit: I’ve been “corrected” by a lot of people that are 100% wrong. Digital currencies on Coinbase are insured against Mt. Gox type attacks. It’s honestly amazing how every time I share this *easily verifiable* information how many people “correct” me.

Are you sure about that? Care to place a wager? Cuz I’ll bet you .1 BTC that digital currencies in Coinbase are insured. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:42:04
It’s insured. Not FDIC insured though. 
First paragraph here:
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:18:58
Where did I advise anyone to keep their cryptos on an exchange? I *explicitly* said in my OP that that’s NOT what I’m doing. Now you’re just making shit up. 
...and you still haven’t admitted that you’re wrong about the insurance either. Now you’re changing the topic instead. lol 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:50:32
Honestly I’m starting to look at this like a Christmas sale. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:37:25
It’s also a safe where if you lose the key there is NO WAY to get into it. 
That security cuts both ways. If crypto goes mainstream I guarantee Average Joe won’t be toying with his private keys 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:04:59
Jesus Christ dude I just *knew* you were going to copy/paste that section. Work on your reading comprehension and then re-read the first paragraph.
Hell, just read *the first sentence*. There are insurances besides FDIC. 
Are you so willfully ignorant or incapable that you breezed right through this?


Or is it just that you’re incapable of admitting that you are wrong? 
Learn from it. Next time, do some quick verification before you make a snarky comment and you can avoid this embarrassment altogether. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:03:52
Maybe you are. I’ve proven to myself that I am not; and there are a lot of people who wouldn’t be comfortable controlling their own keys. You say “well protected” but I think if you try to define exactly what the means then you might run into problems. 
And personally, it’s not about being my own bank. It’s a payment protocol that does away with the need for a centralized trust as well as a potential store of wealth. I see it as an ideal reserve currency. 
Banks and cryptos are *not* mutually exclusive. At the very least banks will still have a role as lenders. If a bank with FDIC insurance wanted to offer to hold my BTC for me and keep it safe I wouldn’t even hesitate to let them. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:37:03

And if they steal your hardware wallet and your keys?
Are you better capable of protecting your keys than an exchange? To my thinking, that’s the ultimate question here. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:42:43
Coinbase needs to be breached. If you PERSONALLY get hacked Coinbase won’t cover it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:18:56
What is coinbase’s part in this?
I’ve been pretty evangelical about them, but if they’re pulling shenanigans then maybe I’ll take that as the kick I need to get myself a hardware walker. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:22:12
A hardware wallet *is* money lying around your house. It’s the equivalent of cash under your mattress. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:07:47
Sounds like you’re just an asshole trolling for a fight - but maybe I’m wrong. I’ll bite. 
DNA is in quotes as obviously an AI wouldn’t use those nucleic bases. You don’t think a generalized AI could figure out a way to store its code on a blockchain? And wouldn’t have a very big interest in doing so to protect itself from deletion or manipulation?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:44:10
&lt;insert joke about Moore’s law&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:29:52
I’m honestly more worried about hardware failure or loss than theft. 
When I made the mattress comparison I was imagining what happens to that money under the mattress if the house burns down. 
The safe comparison is accurate for theft but you’d have to add that it’s a magic safe that’s completely inaccessible if you lose the key. No going to the manufacturer. No resetting the code. It’s gone. 
They’re not wiped by a strong magnetic field - right? That’s a whole different class if worries I’ve had.

PoW is the only proof that’s mathematically secure. PoS is crap. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:05:42
The Gox thing is what finally made me look into Cryptocurrency and find out how wrong everyone is about it. 
I was thinking, "Wait. If these things are worth stealing and this doesn't kill Bitcoin then Bitcoin is not what I think it is." Did the research and discovered that contrary to the nature of a ponzi scheme, the mathematical underpinning for crypto currency is sound. 
I've been down the rabbit hole since! This stuff is brilliant, here to stay, and this is just the beginning of replacing trusts with decentralized distributed networks owned by a global community.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:13:20
It’s also easier to replace a few devs than the miners. We’re not as irreplaceable as we like to think we are. 
-a dev (not a core developer, just a regular non-Crypto dev)
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:46:54
You know, bitcoin actually helped me to understand exactly *why* I have trouble saving. 
Deflationary currency. Why the fuck do I want to have cash sitting in a savings account when it literally has more spending power now than it ever will?
I’m introduced to something that appreciates in value (inflationary currency/store of value) and all of a sudden saving us easy. Huh. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:03:40
I dunno. Where I’m at, I’ll probably cash out pretty quickly if my holdings ever get high enough to payoff my student loans. 
I also know I’d later regret selling when I did, but I really don’t trust my willpower against the prospect of being student debt free.

Satoshi is an AI. It’s storing it’s genetics in a blockchain so that it’s redundant and tamper proof. When it reveals itself it wants to ensure we can’t turn it off or manipulate it. 
Duh.

I thought the idea behind smart contracts is propagated based on the assumption that the underlying mining hardware is capable of functioning as a Turing complete computer?
Bitcoin’s PWA does not require a Turing complete Computer and thus is not capable of implementing smart contracts?
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:40:32
lol. 
It’s quite easy to use. I’m questioning the formula behind the calculator. It’s *not* a magic box that just gives you the right answer you know. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:11:58
Explaining a regular fork is easy to ELI5. Explaining the s2x fork is harder. There are some things a 5 year old won’t understand. 
If someone wants an ELI5 for this it should be “the adults are talking honey. Go to your room and play with your legos.”
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:39:56
Instead of just being a condescending asshole, would you care to explain why larger blocks necessitate more bandwidth?
Or do you or not know either and just accept the argument?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:47:58
You’re so fucking stupid you don’t see that it’s not increased block size that necessitates more bandwidth - it’s the ability to process more transactions that requires more bandwidth. 
You can fuck right off. You’ve proven yourself an idiot who talks about things that they don’t understand. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:37:52
Repeat it all you want. Try explaining what the hell you mean when you say ‘smart contract’
You know what - never mind. Don’t. I suspect this is the Dunning-Krueger effect in action and I won’t get anything meaningful out of you anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:52:59
Oh yeah. I didn’t think of that and it’s a completely valid theory. 
I’m thinking long term. My opinion is that there’s no need to ultimately have more than one or possibly 2 cryptos and the vast majority of alts will eventually die off. 
I do know this is a contentious opinion though and I respect the differing opinions. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:00:29
Thank you! If they’re talking about data throughout and data caps then that makes sense. 
Bandwidth was confusing me. I’m sitting here thinking “if you can download at speeds higher than 100 kB / minute then why are you running a node...”
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:20:40
Why do larger blocks necessitate more bandwidth? Ive seen that argument before but it still doesn’t make sense to me. Nodes are repositories of the blockchain. Bandwidth would effect how fast changes propagate but I can’t see any tie in the 1 mb vs 2 mb blocks. 
Not sure if I’m missing something or if I’m seeing through FUD. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:40:48
I bought at ATH $500 and don’t regret it even a little bit. 
Unfortunately I only bought $10. I wish I’d bought a hell of a lot more. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:20:48
They actually secure the network. The reason that we know the blockchain is sacrosanct is that all the different miners are in agreement + the proof of work algorithm. If the hashrate suddenly drops, it opens up the network to an attack by a malicious actor could try to rewrite the blockchain. 
tl;dr - the more mining power there is the more secure the network is, as long as that mining power isn’t pooled together. The less mining power there is total, the easier it is for a pool to attack. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:44:36
I haven’t actually looked at the core code - so I can’t say. And even if I did *try* to say - it’s very objective what constitutes “good code”. 
The fact that they’ve got the protocol working at all and that it’s not being nuked (like the parody ethereum wallet is) tells me they are definitely good. But I’m just not sure that any programmer is irreplaceable. 
Engineers are a smart bunch that love a challenge. Core is a small team (?) and they seem to want to be a point of centralization themselves - which weakens their anti-centralization argument IMO. If they were to completely abandon the project, I’d be surprised if the vacuum were impossible to fill. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:08:32
Are there any exchanges that rival Coinbase in usability and carry FDIC insurance? I don’t want to support Segwit2x, but Coinbase *is* nice...

I woke up that day and saw how bitcoin was flirting with 9k and sent a buddy of mine a pic of Vegeta just staring. 
He goes “huh?” - I didn’t reply. Went in to see Coco. 
Came out of the movie. $9k had happened. Checked Reddit and was not disappointed. Took 3 screenshots of Vegeta bitcoin &gt;$9k memes and sent them as my reply. 
I just loved the way the conversation played out. 
tl;dr - I agree. &gt;$9k was the peak for bitcoin memes. I don’t think we can ever surpass it.

@_date: 2017-11-07 16:32:48
I’m with you. If this grand experiment fails, it will be AT LEAST a decade before we see this kind of traction in the crypto world again. These people who think that if bitcoin fails then an altcoin would step in to reign supreme are delusional IMO.

Thank you! 
Is there a transcript? I can’t get through that audio...
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:57:58
I don’t see how increasing block size inherently increases centralization; but had it happened in this way then i DO see the problem.
I don’t understand how 2mb blocks would increase the blockchain to a size that it’s prohibitive. As long as a 2mb block is full then it’s practically the same size as 2 one mb blocks, isn’t it?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:38:50
Was ETH the first smart contract? I thought it was but since you’re asking I suspect I’m wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:11:21
I can actually ELI5 now. 
Nothing happened. Nothing to worry about anymore. 
Even ELI18 of S2X is hard though. Replay protection is hard to accurately explain to someone who doesn’t understand the details of how the protocol transfers bitcoins around. It would have been fundamentally different from the BCH fork and explaining why is difficult. 
It’s a technical problem and would require pages of explanation to properly answer. A proper explanation starts with the basics of public/private key encryption, goes through the bitcoin protocol, and ends at replay protection. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:25:36
“World class developers” is a loaded statement. *Every* developer thinks they’re world class, and in an industry that lacks concrete standards there’s no way to quantify or qualify what that statement even means.

@_date: 2017-11-02 16:57:07
I made the mistake of being a passive observer in round 1. I talked a big game about how amazing the Satoshi white paper is and was evangelical about bitcoin. I setup a few mining ASICs but nothing that got me much. 
For round 2 I put my money where my mouth is. Small purchases every payday and hodl. Lets see how good a futurist I really am. :-)
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:43:01
I think a lot of people are going to get burned this time. 
I guess that’s what happens when you don’t understand the tech. Personally, if S2X has the hashing power they claim then I think they’ll win this. They’re playing the long game and some short term losses are nothing compared to a long term monopoly on mining. That argument carries zero weight with me.

Replacing *a* miner is easy. Supposedly b2x has 80-90% of mining power behind them though. Replacing that power would’ve significantly harder than replacing a team of devs. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:26:37
I might have found it. Is the argument that 2mb blocks will increase transactions and increase uptake and that’s a bad thing?
The increased bandwidth argument seems to hinge on the assumption that keeping block sizes small will lead to longer wait times and thus discourage transactions. Is that right?

Nodes hold the blockchain. But each node could have a different blockchain and we wouldn’t know which one was accurate. That’s where the miners come in. They can verify and ensure that the chain hosted on any node is accurate.

I don’t think big blockers lost. I think I’m probably a big blocker. 
But I didn’t like the way the NYA was happening. This is much better. Bitcoin will probably have to be reactive in changes due to the nature of consensus. A lot of people won’t accept theory - they need to see the problem in action before they accept the need for an upgrade.

Had a friend say that my “gamble” on bitcoin is paying off. I laughed and asked him if he read the white paper. He said no. 
Understanding the white paper gives me confidence. Bitcoin is mathematically sound. It’s not a “gamble”, it’s inevitable that barring sone paradigm shift, bitcoin is the future. 
A google search of GDP this year for the world is 77.9 trillion. So personally, I value my bitcoins at 77.9 trillion / 21 million = 3.7 million dollars each. And that goes up as the GDP of the world goes up.

Ultimately I don’t see the need for more than one global currency. It’s infinitely divisible. More than one currency introduces exchange issues. I think the term they use for this thinking “bitcoin maximalism”
