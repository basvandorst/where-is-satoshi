I understand the stance, but what about the people with BTC stuck in Mt.Gox? 
Won't this move hurt Mt.Gox traders more than Mt.Gox itself?
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:29:16
How do you know? If they have a problem, they will let you know won't they?
Before that happens, isn't it important to let MtGox customers know these information? This is such an arbitrary decision.

The Armory wallet project: the new version is so stable, they'll give away **0.01 BTC** if you find and report a bug.
As much as I like Armory, 0.01 BTC is a bit more than $4 right now and doesn't really spell confidence.

yes i agree i grew up in asia too, im just using arguments from the more respected professors on the west to explain black violence
i do think there's a difference tho there's definitely a confucian cultural influence that values stability over others, plus depending on the place inequality matters too like if everyone's poor thats cool but if you're poor and you see rich people doing rich things everyday that's slightly different
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:48:23
what, that wasn't even me what are you on about
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:15:57
exactly, you made a generalisation in your second sentence based on your experiences, similarly people can rationally make generalisations in the states based on their experiences as well - just that it triggers a lot of people in america because politics
if you say black people tend to be more dangerous than say white people in asia a lot of folks especially ones that stayed overseas will just say no shit
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:29:05
yo no one said always, that doesn't make any sense. nothing is black or white. no one can experience everything, but that's why human progress have always been based from empirical experiences from your own lifetime and the collective countless lifetimes of your contemporaries and ancestors passed down in speech and text right.
we have to form a judgement based on the things we know, and if we know say from the media, from our own eyes our own experiences, and recounts from people we trust say friends and family that all in different angles confirm black people *tend* to be more violent more often, than yes - it makes sense to have that judgment, and is very dangerous to not have that judgment just because we have to be 'pc'.
like there's a clear difference, and also what 'my black friends' sentence established and implies, between black people being inherently more violent because the skin is black (*that's* racist) and black people tending to be more violent based on what we have observed even if we're not completely sure why, it's probably not because the skin is black but it so happens that the group of black skinned people have higher incidents of crime due to whatever life circumstances or culture that may result from having black skin, but not because of black skin itself.
it's like looking at a row of 100 guys and you have to pick 10 for basketball and saying oh it doesn't matter if they're 5ft or near 7ft i'm sure they can all play basketball equally well. that doesn't make sense, and although i'm sure there's cases where say the 5ft dribbles extremely well and has great bbiq and just is flat out better player than the 7ft, but in this world you have to make decisions based on limited decisions to be realistic and if you make logical decisions and pick the taller player you'll be more often right than wrong, and the same applies to this black vs. white/asian/whatever safety example
and i honestly hate it when people use racist as an end all be all to discussion, like oh racist - nothing to say now ffs that contributes absolutely nothing to the discussion.
@_date: 2017-02-19 06:01:26
sure not that i disagree but that's kinda irrelevant to street robberies like this btc one we're talking about now
@_date: 2017-02-18 23:13:58
i have a bunch of great black friends but isn't true blacks have higher crime rate?
like if it's dark at night on one side there's an asian or white lady walking down on the other side a black man, which side would you walk on to be safe? of course either side might be safe/dangerous, but it's statistically more likely to be dangerous on the black man side no?
or to bring it closer to the example an asian/white man walking on one side and a black man on the other. same choice probably assuming other things equal. like there's a bunch of reasons for black people having higher crime rates maybe it's culture, maybe it's cause they tend to be poor because of a history of white oppression/racism that contributed, and being poor tends to make people violent etcetc. whatever but that doesn't change the logic at the end of the day right.
like stop the pc bullshit it's not racist it's being rational

@_date: 2017-01-19 14:00:27
first he probably diversified 
secondly the direction he supports is very good for transaction volume + fees and for startups in general because btc now scales better, but it comes at a cost of centralization which kinda destroys the whole point of bitcoin and tbh it's a very short term view 
also the way he goes about it is completely dickish 
you should read into it more and reach your own conclusion

@_date: 2016-11-12 06:38:20
I see your point is that it increases the overall pool, but that depends really if doing just one thing is still competitive (ie, profitable mining) or else it'll just be more centralized

Random question, doesn't you working at coinbase have any conflict with your brother's btcc business?
@_date: 2016-11-21 13:46:11
I don't agree. A contentious hardfork will split the bitcoin community way more than eth/etc did
@_date: 2016-12-03 08:35:18
are you sure..
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:00:00
same, i remember having to use dwolla for a while too
@_date: 2016-11-21 14:47:12
I don't agree either that the community is split into unknown percentages. 
It certainly is split, and it certainly is impossible to know the exact ratio, but I'm pretty sure the increase blocksize rapidly group is a minority, though a very vocal minority. And hardforking now will only give the supporters an unbalanced amount of voice.
Thing is if you look at the most vocal supporters, the most prominent places are r/btc (which is substantially smaller and tbh a troll pool crying this place is censored while hypocritically pushing their own agenda harder)  and VCs/startup founders on Twitter/medium/etc which needs (understandably) their business to scale rapidly because of the vc ecosystem/expectations. That's it, others don't care about doubling quadrupling the size asap as much (not everyone ofc but ya, there's gavin and a few other og bitcoiners too).
Of course having good bitcoin companies boom is good, but not when it comes at a cost of losing many uniquely bitcoin advantages. blockchain is cool, low intl remittances, high # of transactions /s are all very cool and important, but relative to decentralization they're small issues - decentralized money changes fundamentally how the world and government operates and impacts far more people (assuming bitcoin eventually slowly scales with common hardware) in the long long run. I'm an investor too and to me that upside is way greater.

Yes generally, but it's not like Dan Morehead is perennially bullish
@_date: 2017-05-03 00:08:51
and do you know why? there's fiat withdrawal problems therefore increased bitcoin withdrawal pressure, so bitcoin price is higher in bitfinex, while the opposite in okcoin/other chinese exchanges is due to new anti money laundering laws in china preventing btc withdrawals, therefore increased fiat withdrawal pressure.
and places where there's no problems the price is steady around ~1450

Gotcha, thanks - he might very well be an amazing professor in whatever he teaches as far as I know.
@_date: 2015-03-15 04:13:19
Where? I see the profile picture only
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:31:52
I don't agree - he's a professor not a politician, as nice or as professional he might be he should know better than to give an 'expert' opinion on something he's not an expert on much less on national news. Scratch that, he even provided a congressional testimony - if he's wrong doesn't he deserve to be criticized like he does now? No?
Without diving enough into Bitcoin he put out much publicized comments that without question hurt Bitcoin's reputation as a professor, the last profession that should do that. That just shows he's not academically thorough or vigorous enough, and sure you say let's not discredit someone based on one stance - I'm willing to change my mind. It's been a few years, has he contributed anything insightful to Bitcoin, gave any publicized remarks about Bitcoin, apologized publicly for the damage caused, or otherwise in this few years done anything to further his professional experience in Bitcoin?
I can't comment on his expertise in other areas, but in Bitcoin as far as I'm concerned in the context of 'professor' and 'expert' as he was protrayed as he's useless. 
It still is a speculative entity with headlines on price volatility worldwide, now and for the past couple years especially with the price ramp to 1800 now. And the excuse that he hasn't done his research shouldn't really be given to such an outspoken professor, why else should he be given to credibility to be taken seriously? That's definitely not how he got his professorship.
Regardless, you obviously consider him extremely smart and a top 3 favorite, would love to hear examples of his brilliance.  
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:24:08
