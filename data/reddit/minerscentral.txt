My father just said they should of added the names or urls to each of the owners who accept bitcoin in the bottom right corner or something. Show that they are not just actors.

Would stay far away from GAW Miners if your looking to get into altcoin mining checkout cleverhash.com. I personally these guys are legit and are looking to change the mining industry.

Change the wording than I say lets do it.

Thank you for the quick response. That works for most banks but I know Wells Fargo does not show this. Glad to hear and might move some funds over

The major problemwith BitQuick that will hinder their success. Is not being able to see if a cash deposit in an account is actually cash and not a check which is the easiest way to be scammed currently on LBC but can be litigated if someone is checking receipts on their end.
Other then that the service is great and customer support is excellent.
On another note is BitQuick aml/kyc compliant?
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:48:02
Use a service that will route your package back to your house. This creates enough of an incentive for most hackers not to go after the other company just to find your address.

Thanks for the relevant information. I will be running this out of SC which does not have money transmitter license. Can you think of any other licenses I might need
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:34:01
But what about money transmission laws?
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:06:37
Thanks. Still looking for some other references/advice.

I am currently doing the same thing. I am wondering what the credit memo means? Will PayPal still give me a refund after I have elevated my claim or is more action required on my part?

Look into mining protoshares, datacoin, or prime coin with CPUs. Checkout bitcointalk forums

Hey first off that is amazing that another young person like my self is interested in bit coins. I am a little bit older then you but am still a minor. I experienced that horrible issue with buying bitcoins also but I would like to share how I got around these issues.
I used Dwolla because it has a low exchange rate. You mentioned you do not have a bank account something I would suggest is to give you parents or legal guardians the money you would like to invest in bitcoins. Have them but it in their bank account and connect it with your newly made Dwolla account under their name.
Do use Dwolla with mtgox you need to be  a verified user. I will talk about that in a little bit but for now make an account under your parents name with their consent. 
How to get Verified?
This was the trickier part for me because I had not talked to my parents about bitcoins much but if you have not talked to them about it I suggest talking to them soon. Show them this website  and the videos they have explaining bitcoins. Also try to  explain bitcoins in your own words to them. If they are sold on it and want to try it out with you throw your money in and help the bitcoin economy. If they think it is a scam or ponzi scheme (some of my friends and my parents initially thought this) ask them if you can just join in with $10 or sum small amount of money to understand and learn about bitcoin economics. Hopefully they agree to this and are willing to help you out. The next things you will need is to sit down with them scan their id (driver's license or passport) and a bill to both websites to become verified. Mtgox and sending the initial money from the bank account to dwolla can take up to 3 days. This whole process might take a full week or longer to Get verified.  After your account becomes verified you are ready to start buying with bitcoins.
This is not financial advise buddy sorry but just some yeah idk something else...
If you have any other questions or are looking into  learning about mining pm me
@_date: 2013-10-27 23:42:26
I would be happy to do it for you. Just hit me up with a PM.

I feel like high school students and students in general have a ton of pressure on them from maintaining a good gpa, sports, volunteering, family,  problems, and peer pressures. Having google glass would make it very easy to record those moments and help make others aware of the  stress on teens.
