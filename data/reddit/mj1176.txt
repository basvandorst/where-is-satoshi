I was just able to do it today on my second try. First time three of the four questions were completely unrelated to me, second time they were all immediately recognizable. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:27:41
I can't argue with you on the murder-for-hire stuff, that's pretty reprehensible, but are you not aware that there are people who support the idea of Silkroad with good reason? The whole ideological "point" of bitcoin is to take personal finance out of the hands of government, in the spirit of deregulation and privacy. In the same regard, many people believe that it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what chemicals people are allowed to put in their own bodies, and this idea extends logically to the sale and production of said chemicals. Not to mention, DPR didn't "sell" drugs, he simply provided and oversaw a network that allowed individuals to sell drugs, and charged them a certain percentage of their sales for the ability to do so.

Hopefully it will help settle out some of the craziness we've seen today. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:40:19
Reported, again. STOP POSTING THIS SHIT YOU OBNOXIOUS BASTARD.

Down, temporarily
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:57:34
LocalBitcoin, BitQuick.Co, or Coinbase (if you're willing to wait to get verified.)
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:01:40
We know. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:10:01
In, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:17:30
Doesn't seem to take them when I've tried. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:57:44
Except it wasn't a bubble. It'll keep going up, give it time. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:24:56
When they actually become interesting.

You poor, gullible fool. If he had told  you to jump off abridge, would you have?

Malicious URL. Do not click. Reported.

Some have been waiting months now. Mt. Gox is not liquid enough to cash people out when they want to be cashed out, this is well known by now. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:54:15
Nobody gives a fuck that you're spamming all over to try to collect btc one faucet at a time. While you're here though, tell us: does it at least make your tiny little dick hard for the few minutes your posts stay up before they get deleted? It'd be a shame to know you're doing this and getting nothing out of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:41:10
All of this has been answered before, read the sidebar and figure it out on your own like everyone else has had to. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:34:27
Keep trying. My first couple tries I got completely nonsensical questions and on the third try the answers were all obvious. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:31:09
Or don't, because prices regularly fluctuate more than they have today and you're only fueling the fire. Unless you bought in at higher than current price and bought in with money you can't afford to lose, continue to hold. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:24:14
Haha trust me, if we had any reason to believe they were listening we probably would
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:46:40
Read shit before you click. When they're operating as normal, you're locked in at the price you see when you click purchase. When they're running low, the post a notice saying that you can still make a buy order but it'll be at the price of bitcoin on the day listed in the notice. How many more times are people going to post about this...
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:03:22
I use bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:33:05
I welcome it dropping as low as it can while Coinbase drags their ass sending the verification charges to my bank account and while I struggle to answer verification questions about people I've never met. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:40:08


Except, y'know, the majority of the past 36 hours
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:50:08


If you don't mind me asking, how much did you sell (in USD) and what problem did you encounter?
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:26:21
[This one]( , [this one]( [this one]( ... do you need more?
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:36:55
I would. What does that really have to do with anything? Between the Chinese interest and all the western media attention Bitcoin is getting, it's pretty obvious at this point that it isn't going anywhere. Again, I'm not denying that the market would take a hit if the founder bailed out, but it wouldn't take relatively long for the market to recover. Even if it dropped to less than $10 when Satoshi bailed, it would easily recover back to $40 at worst, which would still be great for those who bought in at less than $10. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:29:34
Can't argue with you there, I'm most definitely a purist. But the answer to OP's question is pretty obvious. The media started reporting on Bitcoin when shit got interesting. Altcoins aren't interesting yet, and until they are, they won't be mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:49:38
I find it so hilarious that people overseas love the American college lifestyle enough to actually import or special order solo cups. Do you guys need any visors with state-school or frat logos? Maybe a rack of Natural Light, too? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:10:12


Is it just a waste of time? Have i put my hopes too high?
Yes. 


You can invest as much or as little as you want. As exciting as Bitcoin is, and as much as it's a "for the people" concept, at the end of the day it's still a speculative investment, and speculative investments aren't for everyone. If you don't have the money or aren't comfortable with the possibility of losing money, then you probably shouldn't invest. It's a gamble like any other, the only difference is that it's one of the most exciting and potentially profitable gambles that anyone has seen in years. My recommendation if you're still squeamish is to trade something that already costs you money for an investment in bitcoin. That is, identify something you already consistently spend money on but could do without, and put that money into Bitcoin instead. Enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:25:52
and falling fast :/
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:12:22
Wow, this looks really promising... wonder if it's going to become the new Coinbase. If they can get their verification shit together better than Coinbase then they have my business. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:34:28
Reported. Stop posting this shit. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:00:32
Anyone who says it's unimportant simply means that they have so much faith in the long term viability and current undervalued status of bitcoin that they're willing to take a long position and ignore the price because they "know" it will be worth it in the long run. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:18:28
if none of them were correct why didn't you choose the fifth option?
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:05:59


Maybe if you take off all your tinfoil gear the verification will work. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:31:29
Ah, well that sucks. I wasn't being sarcastic, when I did mine they all had options for "none if the above" and for one of my answers that was the correct choice.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:47:29
No it isn't. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:59:58
Reported. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:16:57
For fuck's sakes stop posting this shit. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:22:45
Just remember, folks, we have no idea if what this person is claiming is true. Not to undermine your attempt if it's legitimate, OP, but we really have no reason to believe this wasn't a legitimate transaction that you new want to renege on. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:03:36
Coinsetter seems to have made a reeeeeally impressive platform. Kicks coinbase's ass. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:03:27
*Slow. Down.* Go read more. Then go read more. Don't make any more wallets or accounts or ANY purchases until you can explain this system to your grandmother. And based on your questions, I have a very hard time believing you thoroughly read the links in the sidebar. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:32:04
Yeah, but way more exciting! 
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:19:23
That would be so amazing...granted, it'd take a little time for the market to recover from the creator dropping his holdings, but it'd be such an incredible buy-in opportunity. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:23:53
transfer the blockchain.info wallet to an exchange like coinbase. Sell on the exchange for USD. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:06:26
They aren't trying to trick you; either the question doesn't pertain to you and you click the "none of the above" option to indicate that or the question has a clear answer that you would know if you're who you say you are, and you select that option. Keep in mind, this isn't some magic system that actually knows who you are. It's just pulling information, some of it relevant and some of it not, and nobody can help it if the question seems vague to you. Just wait 24 hours and try again. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:44:44
Depends on what you want to do, but most people recommend that you should have multiple wallets, so as to limit your risk. At least one of them, and the one with the most value in it, should be stored off any computer or network as a paper wallet and be secured somewhere. If you plan on making speculative purchases or trading actively then you should make an account / "wallet" on one of the main exchanges and then keep an offline software wallet to hold the BTC you want to keep as a reserve for the exchange. Anything beyond that is up to you and your needs. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:36:18
Seriously, can we get a sidebar note about this? We get it, there's a model for bubbles and bitcoin may or may not follow it. Thing is, bitcoin has not followed that model exactly and given that cryptocurrencies are a completely new beast in the financial world, there's no way of knowing what will happen. If you think we're all "condemned," go ahead and sell now. But please stop making these posts, unless you're willing to come back and make a "those who assume things always work the same are doomed to lose out when they're wrong" post as soon as this correction is over.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:28:34


What about my post indicates that I'm not doing this? If anything, that was the exact purpose of me posting here - to get more information
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:05:44
I don't see an option anywhere to do that. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:43:41
Nothing but send you money.

The tip bot creates a blockchain.info wallet for you. You can transfer them from there to wherever you want.

Fuck Mt Gox, you can trade all the bitcoins you want on there but good luck withdrawing as fiat... 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:33:40
Did they give you any insight into why you got flagged as high-risk? I placed an order 6 days ago and it's supposed to be here by midnight tonight, and I haven't seen mine either. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:58:07
For the ones not related to you just select the "none of the above" option. The questions are pretty straightforward...
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:06:48
Localbitcoins, or if you have your own bank account, maybe try getting verified on coinbase... either way, I would not try to trick the exchange you choose or assume your parents' identity. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:35:16


...So your post is meaningless.


Yeah, because pretty much all the problems people have been posting about are things that were either avoidable, directly caused by an uninformed user, or something that we all risk by dealing with a bitcoin exchange at this stage in it's lifespan. We're not dealing with wells fargo here people, this is all a gamble in EVERY REGARD. If that's not ok with you then don't deal with bitcoin exchanges, but if you do, don't expect a bunch of sympathy when shit goes wrong. You are assuming a risk.
