Ah, JP Morgan are prepared to start moving clients over to help aid bitcoin. Oh how times change. All I need now is Mcafee to eat his own D*CK and Jamie Dimon to confess he’s the real crypto MVP to complete the story.

They’ve been doing this for months, nothing new here. Most major funds such as JP or Morgan Stanley are purchasing bitcoin through there so when regulations/an ETF gets approved they will announce they are ‘investing’ into bitcoin but they already own hundreds of thousands of them. Bank Fric is one that’s being used for cryptocurrency a lot at the moment. Also, most ‘OTC’ transactions that happen are off the exchange and done ledger to ledger meaning that the large purchases that these institutions are doing are not on the exchange which makes the retail trader/investor feel that bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. The smart ones are holding and adding to there wallet. When these Legacy coins run out to purchase institutions will HAVE to purchase through an exchange... Thus rising the price of BTC. Just be patient....

Ledger to ledger transactions are actually common. Normally presented in a lawyers office with a MT103/202 payment or 760 blocked funds. You won’t get a ledger to ledger transaction in a coffee house, (maybe cash deals) there was a murder last month with such a deal like that.

That’s some D-Day mining operation there! Fascinating. I have several ‘one trip’ shipping containers that currently are rented out, this would be a great source of income. I am not sure on the increasing difficulty and start up costs would be as profitable in terms of margin as renting the containers for storage. 
A rented container will return 70% per year with little to no running costs. I would imagine something like a mining operation would cost 10’s of thousands to set up with continuous running costs and maintenance. More risk but possibly more return! Good luck to anyone who is doing this, great idea.

Judging by the looks of it the actual news article has been credited to CCN.com not zero hedge. It’s not my article....
