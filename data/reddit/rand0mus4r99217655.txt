Anybody care to share the channel list?

If in Europe [Cashila.com]( works great. Up to 1,000 eur without verification.
@_date: 2016-04-28 12:24:07
Yup, [Cashila.com]( also my no.1 choice in Europe.
@_date: 2016-04-19 12:14:40
Yes. With Cashila you can convert your Bitcoins to euros or the other way around. They let you have an online "bank account" so it's great for receiving payments in crypto or euro.. you can send that funds to whomever you want.
Been using them for quite some time and it's a great service!

Plot twist: Iceland PM did NOT resign but merely asked his deputy to be PM "for an unspecified amount of time".
Bitcoin's part as the reserve currency gets postponed until the next election.

Do US ATMs really require ID verification? How does that work?
Nothing i've seen here in Europe..
@_date: 2015-12-29 13:57:29
Yeah, i also used them whenever i can.. 
First I did try to keep my bitcoins intact as an investment.
But then i discovered two great startups (interesting, both from my home country Slovenia), that let me pay for anything without worrying about my investment.
**Cashila** 
Lets me pay bills using bitcoins. Works by converting bitcoins to EUR at the current exchange rate and paying for anything via SEPA. It's great if you are from the EU. Usually I use them when paying for my gsm bill, when i want to cash out bitcoin to my bank account, or i need to pay a friend, hehe.
The other one is **Reload by Bitnik** 
Keeps an eye for outgoing transactions from my wallet address and every time i make a purchase - it instantly buys the same amount from the exchange of my choice.
Now i can freely spend my bitcoins on almost anything, and when i do, my btc balance stays the same.
Give them a try and spend bitcoins whenever you can ;)

Definitely recommend [Cashila]( :)

The hardest part is IMO getting the money to Europe. From there (since everyone is in SEPA) transferring funds is quite easy. The EUR I'm sending to your bank account in the UK gets converted to GBP by your bank. And since it is a bank, the fx rate should be near the official.

Yup, mine too. Love his music!

The latest integration with [Cashila]( makes it even greater! Been paying my bills straight with my phone ever since. Gentleman, the future is here :)
@_date: 2016-03-25 14:42:44
My thoughts exactly :)
@_date: 2016-01-27 11:22:12
I bet there will be even more wallets. Lots of bitcoin startups appearing in the region.
@_date: 2016-03-30 20:16:19
You should get an account at Cashila ( With them you can make transfers to any bank in Europe with your Bitcoins. 
Probably the easiest and safest way :)
@_date: 2016-03-11 09:06:16
Digital goods, some services, but mainly for [paying bills](
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:08:18
Nice! Love the integration you did with [Cashila]( :)
For all who don't know the service - you can make SEPA deposits to any EU bank account (like paying bills, sending funds to family,...). I checked, and Mycelium users get 1.000 EUR of free transfers to try the service.
@_date: 2016-06-08 08:11:29
great story bro!
@_date: 2016-06-02 11:02:59
Norther Cyprus can be tricky. Usually I use [Cashila]( to transfer bitcoins to any bank account, but you should check with their support.
Or send him bitcoins and he can look up some traders at Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2016-02-25 11:55:08
I'm in Europe and been using Cashila ( for more than a year. So far it's great :)
@_date: 2016-02-25 22:16:56
Love the site! :)
@_date: 2015-11-28 08:48:32
Hehe. Nice!
@_date: 2016-05-26 10:32:12
Very nice!

Reload by Bitnik is a service to reload your bitcoin address when you spend from them. I bet you can track *any* address and get instant notifications when something moves.
@_date: 2016-05-15 18:23:58
To bad it is not up to date. From 2015 and on.. Like the Bitstamp Theft from January 2015.
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:56:34
Great to see [Cashila]( mentioned. Love the service :)
Regarding the price instability of BTC in the article. I think the price was quite stable in the last months, or at least not loosing in value.
@_date: 2016-05-09 18:43:06
Great article! Been trying to live on bitcoin with [Cashila]( as well. Recently they had a blog post about it - you can use their service and at the same time keep your bitcoins intact with [Reload](

Love trading on The Rock. An old-school, but solid exchange. Never had any problems whatsoever and their support was always great. Keep up the good work! :)
