For the record, and for context (and because I love to brag) - I am the author of LMDB. LMDB is the world's smallest/fastest/most reliable transactional embedded data store. (These are well documented facts, not marketing boasts.) I developed LMDB as part of the OpenLDAP Project. OpenLDAP is today the world's fastest and most scalable distributed data store, and has been so for a dozen years (mainly due to extensive profiling and rewriting I conducted in the 2000-2002 timeframe). Prior to working on OpenLDAP I authored the world's fastest Appleshare fileserver (hosted on Unix) and Appletalk protocol stack.
I didn't do the original LMDB adaptation work in Monero, that was started by two other Monero developers. I came along later to help with 32bit support and optimizing their use of the DB. I may not have a deep understanding of how Monero works as a complete system, but I know software scaling, intimately.

As of  the initial sync time of a new wallet is less than 2 seconds. The new DB format also reduces space consumption by around 30%. And the infinite tail emission simply compensates for lost coins, which are inevitable when people lose their keys.

Success problems...
Monero has existed for 2 years. Bitcoin has existed for ~8. 6 years from now all relevant tech will be faster, higher capacity, and cheaper, and even if none is faster, 2 seconds to 8 seconds won't make a jot of difference.

Yes. The generator is constrained to preclude infinite loops and other such nonsense.

Thanks for the ping. It actually generates random programs for *every nonce* not just every block. The period of the PRNG is 2^256 -1 (xoshiro256+) so anybody who wants to "optimize every algorithm" is going to have a huge job ahead of them.

The article is flat wrong. The understanding of PoW is flat wrong.
Read and learn: 
No PhD required. Just simple logic.

The input is fed to a cryptohash so it can't be forged or trivially pre-chosen. The generated source code is fed to the cryptohash so again the result can't be faked. The generated program uses exec() which requires an actual javascript interpreter to evaluate it, so taking a shortcut around the JS interpreter won't work. The program output is fed into the cryptohash so the result can't be faked. The approach itself is sound.
There's no user input to the algorithm, so remote exploit is not possible. Even so, I'm recommending that the entire hash run in a separate process, with the hash seeds fed in by a pipe and result read back from the pipe, to fully isolate the JS engine from the coin daemon. Just because paranoia here is healthy. The implementation will be secure.

Storage concerns are pretty much noise.
  
Also, the Aeon fork of Cryptonote clones has been piloting pruning methods for quite a while, so adopting them back into Monero means picking up mature methods with known behaviors. Your O(n) point still holds of course.
Bandwidth is also a fair point, but since Monero now does sparse block propagation (aka fluffy blocks) that's also well managed already. By most measures, this is the most important barrier going forward - you can't send data thru a pipe faster than the speed of light. Latencies are hitting a wall; we only get higher bandwidth now from fatter pipes.
I believe you have accurately identified Monero's current scaling challenges. I'm not sure you've fairly assessed their costs, but only time will tell. Also, Monero doesn't stand still, and radical changes still have a pretty easy time of getting deployed.
As a footnote, as Chief Architect of the OpenLDAP Project, I'm the only person on Earth who has developed and deployed a distributed data store that scales to billions of users and delivers query results at rates of 1M queries/sec per server in under .1ms avg latency. I.e., the only solution in the world efficient enough and scalable enough to service telcos in Asia. When I talk about scalability I'm not just making WAGs.

"to be implemented" means the first clause of your sentence is false.
Zcash has claimed to solve all kinds of problems; all of those claims are lies. They were false when the claims were made, and are still false at this point in time.

Pruning patches have been merged into Monero master just in the past week or so, so, no. And no, Monero using LMDB uses far less RAM than Bitcoin with whatever garbage DB it uses.

You have no idea what you're talking about. I, on the other hand, have reams of data and technical reports showing that LMDB is the smallest / fastest / most reliable embedded database engine in the world and that LevelDB (which Bitcoin uses) is bloated crash-prone crap.
Bitcoin's tx rate is pathetic. The DBs I've built are serving millions of transactions per second on single box servers, for the biggest networks in the world. Come back when you actually know something.

Interesting claim. Transactions are on average, a constant factor larger than Bitcoin's (12x or 25x, depending on how you count...). Constant factors don't harm scalability. Improvements in network capacity and storage bandwidth both continue to be super-linear over time, totally dwarfing our current resource requirements.
On-chain scaling is superior to Bitcoin's because of the dynamic blocksize. Combined with the 2-minute block time vs Bitcoin's 10-minute block time, Monero can easily process more transactions in any given interval of time. In practice, Monero's network processes txns faster than Bitcoin's, which still seems to be limited to 3.5txs/sec.
Ultimately, neither Bitcoin nor Monero will scale to Visa-level transaction rates, in their current form. No linear data structure ever could; this is a fundamental weakness of the Blockchain design. The only approach that *ever* scales well is hierarchical design - tree structures. Based on the speed with which the Bitcoin community has tackled its blocksize debate, I'm pretty confident Monero will have implemented a real scaling solution long before Bitcoin ever does.

Have fun if someone ever pays you with tainted Bitcoins.
Have fun if someone you've ever transacted with in Bitcoins decides you've got a tempting wallet balance, worth hunting you down and assaulting you over.
etc. etc. etc...

Sure, they have internet in hell - it's run by comcast.
