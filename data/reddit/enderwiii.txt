I thought BTC was banned?
@_date: 2014-12-10 06:13:12
ayy lmao
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:59:41
I've never heard of purse before. Kind of excited to try it :)
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:20:10
Thanks for all the info! What websites / forums can I advertise on?
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:24:24
I'm going to be convincing them to accept bitcoins as proof of funds instead of fiat. And I'll need to coordinate with escrow to convince them to accept the funds. For people not familiar with bt, it's like convincing them to accept Monopoly money...

@_date: 2015-05-24 17:29:08
Most accountants won't know what bitcoin is. Can you please tell me more?
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:21:07
Thanks. I know BitPay is a way to accept payments, but where can I reach bt owners who would be interested in buying a house?
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:08:29
Los Angeles County. Specifically Arcadia, CA. I currently have properties in Arcadia, San Marino, Pasadena, Encino, Monterey Park, City of Industry, and Rosemead.
@_date: 2015-05-23 23:19:29
Just listed on there! Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2015-05-24 05:10:39
Why wouldn't they? I just learned about Bitpay so my sellers would get paid in fiat.
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:23:50
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:28:14
I'm confident I can convince most sellers I meet to accept bitcoin. Right now, I need to find people with enough bt to buy.
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:42:09
If bt really is the future, then someone will need to think of these implications regardless. We've found another niche market! haha
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:53:21
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:26:35
I'm not trying a marketing strategy. I actually want to take over this niche market.
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:27:18
I have one in my garage, but it only transports me to the future.
@_date: 2015-05-24 05:11:12
I'm more than open to partnering up.
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:15:11
Please PM me for anything like this. I'm not here to solicit for business. I'm just here to try to better serve my clients and bring Bitcoin into the mainstream. I'm down quite a bit since bt dropped so anything I can do to get it back up will get my gf off of my back... hahaha.
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:28:40
Great list! Anyone have any resources on starting a non-profit?
@_date: 2016-03-24 17:51:31
Wow! That's super generous! I'll ask some of my local shelters and help at least one no kill get set up with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:23:44
Can I still be the second?
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:27:27
That's my goal!
@_date: 2015-05-13 01:03:01
A beer for you all!
@_date: 2016-03-24 17:10:00
California okay? How much were you thinking?
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:27:54
Right now because of the transaction fees, a property will get more in fiat.
In California, lawyers aren't used to transfer property.
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:27:12
I can convince all of my sellers to accept Bitcoin. I just want to find potential buyers.
@_date: 2016-06-05 07:51:52
No one has ever signed up under my account so I don't know what to tell you. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 02:35:11
I can buy and sell coins with Circle? Is there a fee to sell?
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:11:23
When bitcoin was $20, I wanted to buy 5 of them but it was so hard to buy that I couldn't figure it out.
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:56:42
I tried mining for a few weeks. Never got anything and my computer almost overheated. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 05:46:07
They charge really high fees to buy and sell bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:20:44
Recommend what? Coinbase?
@_date: 2016-11-10 05:29:24
Whoa! You're awesome! Can I also get a tenner? I'll be super happy when I receive it and then forget about it and it'll go back into your account! Win-win! :D
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:18:22

I changed my bank login temporarily and then used it to login through their authentication system. Then I sent the verification code to my phone via text. Then I changed my password back in my online bank settings.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:28:20
I believe in Bitcoin. I own Bitcoins (localbitcoins.com). We need to stop protecting bad companies.
Bitcoin is a fledgling movement and needs to be as legitimate as possible. I was warned about Coinbase cancelling my transaction if the price were to go up when I made this [post]( which means they already have a bad reputation. For it to actually have happened means that they're not a reputable company. When things go south, they will run off with everyone's Bitcoins. I'm willing to bet on it.
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:50:49
Going to grab some bt here to spead around! heh heh heh
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:03:22
What does it say about our movement (and Bitcoin IS a movement) that the most legitimate company is willing to scam customers?
$25M is a drop in the bucket in terms of VC funding. Just because they're well known doesn't mean they won't run off with all your Bitcoins when times get tough.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:05:12
Nice trolling :)
I paid for 1 Bitcoin at ~$760. The price goes up 25%. My transaction is cancelled after they've been holding my money.
Not sure how buying 1 Bitcoin is fraud.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:00:49
To me, this doesn't make sense. I don't get the coins until they have the money from my bank account. I'm not buying a large amount either. It's not like I can do a charge back and run off with my 2 bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:43:03
I already emailed them. I will post an update with how they respond. I think it's time we stop making excuses.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:34:57
As I do not have a VISA card, it would have not been possible for me to be verified for instant purchase. Coinbase could easily have offered a Mastercard and / or American Express option.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:20:11
I verified as much as I could because I had wanted to purchase more Bitcoins once I was able to. I would have verified any information they requested. I've had the funding bank account for over 10 years.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:52:40
I really hope I didn't make a huge mistake...
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:27:34
I don't know if there's a way to pick payment methods like with PayPal. If it uses my credit card, i'll be paying fees.










@_date: 2013-12-09 13:33:41
I might be dead from disappointment...
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:39:55
Coinbase scammed me by cancelling my Bitcoin purchase when the price went up 25% from where I initially purchased. I would avoid keeping your Bitcoins with this company at all costs. When times get tough, I wouldn't be surprised if they disappear with everyone's Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:51:12
Sorry about that. I placed my order; I haven't actually gotten a coin yet. It says I should get it in 3 days.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:30:41
It's saying my coins will come in 3 days or so.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:03:06
Do I transfer my bitcoin from Coinbase into a "wallet"? The "getting started" and "faq" don't really talk about securing my bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:59:48
Protip - after you signup, go to trybtc.com and get 30 cents free! Hahaha.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:45:31
To be fair, I don't see how bank wire transfers are reversible. How many old grannies have been tricked by Nigerian princes only to never recover their transferred funds?
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:54:44
Uh, this subreddit is the epitome of fanatical devotion. People who criticize anything related to Bitcoin are shouted down.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:35:00
My experience is a unique experience. I believe that people need to have information about those entities that are the de facto faces of Bitcoin, especially with Coinbase's recent $25M USD VC funding. Coinbase is not a reputable company, yet a quick look at the comments and downvotes shows how much people still believe they're a great company. Clearly the dozen "high risk" threads are being shouted down.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:23:42
I did set my real name. I was told I would only have one chance so I did it. It matches my funding bank account letter for letter.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:26:05
Ahhhh. I see...
Thank you very much! :)
Now to spread the wealth!
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:22:46
For me it's not frustrating since I didn't lose any money. I call out a scam company like this, spread the word, and move on. I have no desire to work with a scam company. What happens when times get tough? They will just run off with your coins.
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:42:50
Thanks for the support. I'm not worried about the downvotes. People have a hard time disassociating anything related to the things they love from the thing itself. It's how the community has been "shocked" so many times by people running off with most of the coins in an exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:30:20
The people here strongly believe in Bitcoin, but they're letting their positive emotions for the movement overlap with the companies and people who associate with Bitcoin. It's why there's always such widespread disbelief when a company disappears with peoples' Bitcoins. "No one" sees it coming because everyone refuses to see the warning signs.
