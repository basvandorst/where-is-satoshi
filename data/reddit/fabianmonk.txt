Rats, I guess that was bound to happen. Thanks for pointing it out, I'll correct it.

Thanks! The first two need some adjustment in order to fold properly, as it stands now the eye/key icons would probably get cut kinda awkardly. Haven't actually printed any yet though, I'll update if I run some tests!

Thanks for the tip, will keep it mind!

Thanks! I'll see what I can do with Canton Beckers generator, seems to have everything needed. I'll let you know!

Neat idea, thanks! And I agree it's more of a gimmick.

Thank you!

These are some great resources, thanks man! Gonna see what I can do with this format!

Thank you!

If anyone wants, I'd be happy to make these available somehow. Unfortunately though I don't know how to code, so anything beyond uploading a printable version somewhere (which you would have to edit yourself), not really sure what I could do. 
Edit: I updated the image description on Imgur with these links as well.
high res PSD, layered (20.3 mb) : 
high res TIF, flattened (4.2 mb) :

Maybe in the future!

It's from the calculations section of the white paper. There's an existing paper wallet which displays it as well, but I'll admit I have no real clue if its' placement within this image makes sense.

Glad you like them! I updated the post with a link to higher res files.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:05:35
Thanks for the offer! Sent you a pm.

Good to know, thanks! Probably gotta extend the white frame around the QR codes on versions 2 and 4.

Thanks! I'll give you a link once I have it, just been notified I missed a minus sign in the equation there, gonna have to correct that.

Thank you!
