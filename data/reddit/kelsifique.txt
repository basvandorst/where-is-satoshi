Exactly... my feeling is that if you don't have the two-factor auth required at least for the $100 or more you taking quite a risk as it is.

Wow and as soon as I typed that comment, it fixed itself and uploaded my past transactions.  I guess it just takes a little while :)

I've been waiting for this!  So glad they listened to the people requesting this link up.  Now Mint just needs to adjust how it shows the unrealized gains/losses... right now it is just showing my total holdings in it's current USD value, as if that's the amount I paid for it.  It also doesn't show BTC value at all (ony USD) but I suppose for the time being and for Mint's purposes, that's ok.

Well all the transactions appeared under "Transactions" for the Coinbase account, and for about one minute the "performance" chart was showing growth from November until now... and then for whatever reason the chart went back to only showing today's performance.  Frustrating because the Gains/Losses are super inaccurate that way.

The airline employs these people to assist you in checking your luggage.  Usually you will see them if you do curbside check-in.

How much have people been tipping you for these?

Thanks for this, I was looking for a cool way to gift bitcoin in our family's white elephant exchange.  I found this Christmas themes paper wallet on that website you mentioned!  Gonna load it up with $50 worth of BTC (that's the limit we set for the gift exchange.)

These are beautiful!

Both good ideas, thank you!  I'm going to play around with this today and see what I come up with.  Definitely don't want to personalize it too much since I don't know who will end up with it.  But I do want it to be exciting to the recipient.

This guy is smart.  I travel a lot for work, and sometimes I check up to 40 pieces of gear at a time.  Depending on the job and what their tipping allowance is, we tip $2-$3 cash per piece.  This skycap could build a nice little BTC balance very quickly if people start utilizing this.  I hope I see more people with heavily tip-based incomes utilizing this soon!
