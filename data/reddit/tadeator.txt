I believe that good % of people who sold their crypto for fiat will just buy back later. Once it stabilizies, people will buy back in, including me.

I am not brainwashed, i believe in my investion, you probably did not, so that's why you sold your Bitcoin and lost your money, jk.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:25:23
Yeah, i am not gonna say i am not scared about it, i am scared it will go to 8-7k, hopefully that's not gonna happen. But as you said, this dip is killing greedy people and most of this shitcoins.

This maybe could send us back to stone age. This would have bigger impact than Mt. Gox.
It's serious. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are crashing naturally, just look at the chart, then Bitfinex prints some fake munies and it starts rebounding, but the rebound is just temporary.
They now have to do it more often. Follow  on Twitter or TetherPrinter.

Well, i can setup that and just tell them where to send the payment.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:09:42
Well, you are too naive if you believe no one is corrupt. What about the infamous Bitconnect, they werent scam right? What about Mt. gox?

I see posts like this daily and i really don’t understand. I’ve been paid in Bitcoin for countless jobs over Internet, i’ve paid for many services in Bitcoin. And that’s just the beginning...

He is not my friend, but what’s the truth?

I've created this design mainly for myself, but i've decided to share it with you guys.
I've listed it on Teespring and i will be donating 80% of profits to local charity.
Let's spread the good word of Bitcoin and altogether.

Almost instant transactions, faster lighter network, lower fees, very huge improvement

Ponzi or scam or pyramid or all together, GTFO.

Buying in.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:23:50
Well, my Trezor should arrive today so i will just wait for this.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:12:35
Nice perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:10:35
Well, then you must be lucky one or you do not pay that often. Last time cashing out BTC i had to wait 11 hours.
But in past two weeks i cannot complain about the confirmation speed, 2 hours max.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:16:50
Guys, you got me wrong, i was not fast enough to load money into exchange, i wanted to buy at 11k. HODLer here

What is Bitcoin Futures?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:37:27
No, as someone said above, he actually supports Bitcoin. It would be nice to see Bitcoin hit 20k usd this December. 
But we need to keep in mind there will be some dips soon, or at least i think so, because people will sell some of their holdings for Christmas etc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:05:26
Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Believe in Bitcoin and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:05:41
I am actually pretty enjoying the fact that someone makes jokes out of what i just did. HODL
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:17:15
Hey, never ever store your coins on any site, if you do, these coins are not yours, you are not the one in control.
Use Blockchain or Electrum

Hello, 
i am 17 years old and i’ve invested everything i’ve had from programming and security analysis.
If you believe in Bitcoin, just go for it. I truly believe in Bitcoin and that’s why i am not scared of bigger dips or price crashes.
You have no assurance you will make some profit, risk is always involved, but you can check Bitcoin’s history and make your own opinion, so far Bitcoin seems to make profits to anyone who holds it for some time.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:33:59
Mining would not be profitable in your case, but definetely hop in, i’ve bought few days ago and toda i’ve bought some more. Then just HODL and enjoy the ride.
