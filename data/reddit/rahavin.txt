But they will continue to rise, ya? More and more people are starting to buy, and world trade is going the way of cryptos.

I still think the only reason they did that was so some Chinese bankers could cash in before they legalized it shortly after. People got rich from that move for sure.

Chase closed my account after a scammer stole coins from me by telling the bank that I never delivered what he had paid for. I even had transcripts proving otherwise. They gave the money to him and refused to talk with me, even claiming that I was a criminal. I had transcripts. I had the people at the trading site saying the scammer was a known theif. Fuck Chase Bank.

Every government official is guilty of that and more in Thailand. I think they scapegoat him to get eyes off of themselves. During the last round of protests there were people demonstrating against the Shinawatra family's corruption while at the same time saying that their own corruption was okay because the people accepted it as part of their lives. Basically, the logic is: My corruption = ok, my political opponent's corruption = worse than cancer (Unless you're Hitler, because he was strong.   It's mind numbing. Funny because for how much Thaksin's opponents blame him for everything from potholes to poltergeists, he arguable improved both infrastructure and international relations and business. Whatever.

It feels like a nice warm blanket made from quilted McDonald's napkins.
