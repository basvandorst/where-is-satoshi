Isn't it key to the whole dpr allusion that there would be one to take over the identity anyway?
If there isn't another it seems like a wasted opportunity

One of the big points about bitcoin is the anonymous nature of it. 
If everything is recorded through the blockchain how is it not trivial to unwind every transaction through the entire history of bitcoin to see all the transactional history?

You can tell if coin lands at a place like coinbase though correct?
I know a bit about netsecops as it relates to the darknet sites so I know a savvy person that wants to remain anonymous wouldnt transact with a fragile procedure.
My friend just got ransomed having his server encrypted and I want to be sure I can fill him in on the realities involved in how this went down.
The likely options for the criminal are to hold the coin safely and use it in the bitcoin economy, trade it locally which is a good measure for anonymity or rather foolishly route it to a place like coinbase and cash it out.
I just want to affirm these are the likely options and Im not missing anything.

"i will make it legal" --darth sidious
If he was in that situation could it be trivial to classify him as an enemy combatant and terrorist fly him off to 'Fernando Poo' and torture him there quite legally!?

Is there any logic to running a mining operation for your own transactions or for a specific set of users.
Im wondering the feasibility of this.  Could basically a novice or hobbyist with no dedicated hardware just run the mining as needed given an appropriate service level agreement?
Assume that your mining motive is not for a bitcoin reward but for establishing relationships for people not "plugged in".  Or assume Somebody provided a service for 1% surcharge...

Thats true.
I just don't know if I ran a program myself could I within 2 hours be reasonably sure that my transaction goes through if I acted as the miner for my tx with a Macbook for instance.  
It sounds like it couldn't be because I'm doing random proof of work for some random block?

I was asking something similar in another thread before.
Lets say that you do mine it as a hobby. Assuming that you could mine .165 bitcoins monthly running 24x7 and the reward is 12 bitcoins that would mean that it would take you 6 years to mine a block single threaded.
This isn't the way a hobbiest would do it!
Does the software exist to participate in a network that gives you an incremental reward for work done to complete the block?
I would think you only have "something" once a block is actually completed.
