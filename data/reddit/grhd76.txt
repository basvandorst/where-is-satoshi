This goes back to my original point - regardless of the BTC transaction fee - if the resulting USD fee was $0.25, my guess is that the motivation for miners is going to be severely diminished.

I see the argument for higher number of transactions.
The higher value of Bitcoin resulting in a better payoff in transaction fees doesn't hold weight though. Similar to the previous argument if 1BTC is worth $100,000 then one mBTC is $100. If I want to purchase something for $50 there is no way I'm paying a $100 fee to process. 
The machines will likely become more efficient and the overall cost of running a machine might stay constant. However, a user is still going to look at it as an investment. If the initial cost of purchase and running a machine don't result in a 5-10% return on investment then the user is not likely to keep going.

In this example one mBTC would be worth $100...but if you're trying to make a transfer of BTC for something on Amazon (or other ecommerce site) that is worth only $60 I don't think the user would want to pay this high of a fee.
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:19:47
But given the likely astronomical difficulty in the future wouldn't the payoff for running a powerful miner require more than one mBTC?

uhh dude, you realize that the key to making Bitcoin a real currency is to make it viable in day to day trade?
That means merchants accepting Bitcoin in exchange for goods. 
In our store we accept euros, hong kong dollars, Philippine pesos, etc.The key to ANY..........currency is liquidity. Using a currency doesn't cause a decrease in its value......it INCREASES its value. One big reason Bitcoin could decrease in value is if people hoard it and don't spend it, resulting in Deflation.

Wow, It is really a shame to hear about this. 
We pre-ordered a Neptune and requested a refund at the beginning of January. The wire transfer refund finally went through in mid February. They cited similar issues with bank transfer issues...it took several calls to their offices to get things worked out but they did finally come through.
I remember the sales page specifically saying that regardless of payment method, any refund would be done in USD (this was when BTC was trading at ~$1000). I even asked for a BTC refund when they were having issues with the wire transfer - they declined. 
How tables have turned.
I'm sorry to hear of these issues and I wish you all the best.

True, that $ number is nice.
However, isn't the upper limit for a block 1MB which is ~3,000 transactions? So if your pool makes the block the resulting fee would be $750 (as opposed to today's 25BTC ~$23,750). 
Doesn't the difficulty get adjusted so blocks are mined every 10 mins? This seems like the overall transaction value would be very limited.

Thanks for the support everyone! We're blown away from the comments/advice/orders. We are happy to be part of the bitcoin revolution and are looking forward to the future! We hope all your cats sleep well!
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:45:23
Keep googling there are some good ones out there. Ours keeps the cats in a hideout :)

The payment option comes right at the end - multi step process and something we're trying to streamline a bit further (trying to work out the kinks with Shopify).
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:24:04
Yeah, we'll be uploading an image at the bottom of the page. However, the Bitcoin payment option is showing up for us when we test. 
If it is not showing up for you then this is probably the most obvious reason why we're not getting any transactions using Bitcoin...we'll have to investigate further.

It fits on a variety of chairs. You can see other people's setup here: 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:22:46
Haha, you'd think we would have thought of that already? I guess we were so concerned with getting the payment gateway open that we forgot to add the logo at the bottom of the page...I'm assuming the standard "B" logo for Bitcoin is a good one to go with?

I don't think bitcoin is like ff miles. Rather, the general public is very comfortable with the notion of paying with this frequent flyer "currency". These same people are uncomfortable with the notion of bitcoin and therefore should be shown the benefits of bitcoin.
People are very worried about bitcoin not being "real" but they're very comfortable with paying for flights using frequent flyer miles that are severely restricted in use and suffer extreme inflation.
Just trying to think of ways for the general public to relate to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:03:14
Just trying to say we support Bitcoin through the ups and downs. We also feel that in order for Bitcoin to strengthen its foothold more retailers need to accept it and keep the Bitcoins moving. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:56:36
Thanks!!! Our first Bitcoin transaction :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:09:45
now you're talking!
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:30:07
We started accepting Bitcoin during the last plateau. No regrets. We went into it with eyes wide open and realized it would be a long term play. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:25:19
We're trying to figure out the programming to display the different currencies :)  Not sure if our checkout software has that option.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:47:15
Yeah, we posted to a few "where to buy using bitcoin?" sites. I smell a biz opportunity for a good website directory. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:41:03
yep! We ship international. It is $17 (don't know the current btc conversion)
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:21:27
only the Cat Crib right now, no "puppy crib" just yet, stay tuned :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:54:55
Cats don't use Bitcoin? ;)
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:39:38
That is what we thought....but we also thought there might be a strong correlation between bitcoin users and cat owners? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:42:18
:( sorry to hear about your kitty.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:48:07
that would be ammmaahhhhzing....you got the hook up?
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:26:36
If there is one things that cats like...it's sleeping.
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:56:07
That is beyond our skill set. We prefer watching cats sleep. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:48:37
BTC FTW!
