I use to believe bitcoin needed to reach a point of stability so it could be used as widely accepted medium of exchange but now i think that might actually hurt bitcoin, I think it's best Bitcoin stays volatile, We need the speculators pumping up that market cap so Bitcoin will become an investment vehicle while still also could be used as a secondary medium of exchange.

"A fool and his money are soon parted"
Seriously. What idiot stores hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin in an exchange?
The most Bitcoin i have ever owned was 4 BTC and i never stored it in an exchange for more than an hour, After i got done trading i would immediately move it to a secure wallet on blockchain.info which i had made serveral backups of for extra security.

I don't, I'm not a day trader, I have been in bitcoin since early 2011 and by now i can tell just by reading the news what bitcoin will do, I dont need to look at charts all day or any of that shit, I make a trade and within a few weeks or maybe even months it pays off big, I made $50 just three days ago because i knew bitcoin was going to go back to $700 so i bought at 5 something and few weeks later boom $700 my sell order kicked in and i made $50 profit.

If you stick around for the trial then you are at the mercy of the court, Why take the chance? Think about it, You have $500M in Bitcoin, You could buy a new identity, Pay off some pilot and someone at customs to smuggle you out of japan and on down to a nice beautiful south american beach somewhere.
I do watch a lot of movies but that doesn't mean it's impossible to get away, It is. People have done it.

Did they just recently purchase 150 btc or did they adopt early?

I think there might be a firefox addon for that but i'm not sure how "Real time" it would be.
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:52:37
Only if you are an idiot, If you stole $500M in an anonymous portable money then you could buy yourself a new identity and disappear forever.
$500M in Bitcoin you could buy yourself a nice house somewhere on a secluded beach and live like a king, It would be easy as shit to launder those Bitcoins too.
You give me $500M in Bitcoin and i gurantee you will never find me.

It's overvalued, Wild speculation has pumped it to the moon when it has very little utility.
People use it but it's not being widely accepted everywhere and it probably never will, I think a lot of investors are hoping one day it will become mainstream and wal-mart will start accepting it but that's not gonna happen because Bitcoin has a very serious flaw, You have to be tech savvy and smart to use it, Most of the population is borderline computer illiterate.
Any idiot can hand someone a dollar bill or swipe a visa card but bitcoin is magnitudes more complicated.
It's overvalued.
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:58:54
It's design makes it very hard to simplify enough for the masses to understand and use it which is why it will never become mainstream.

I'm still waiting for a blockchain.info app for WP8.
There is a [bitcoin wallet app]( for WP8 but it's not an official blockchain app like android has.

They can only regulate the exchanges, Bitcoin is decentralized and there is nothing to stop in person cash to BTC transactions from taking place.
Or underground exchanges popping up on the Tor network.
They can "Try" to regulate it but that's about it...

I'm not sure how it is everywhere else but in the US i believe any money money you make from a Bitcoin trade is considered a capital gain.
@_date: 2014-03-06 01:23:11
You wouldn't store $100k in cash at a friends house would you?
Storing $100k in btc at an exchange is like letting a total stranger "hold on" to your money for you.
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:59:15
I will, Because it has a little thing called utility and intrinsic value, Bitcoin is pegged to fiat, If fiat where to collapse tomorrow how would you determine the value of a bitcoin? With silver and gold!
Also if the SHTF internet access might be a little hard to come by.
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:48:06
That is the nature of all money based systems, The rich cannot exist without the poor, If everyone had an equal ammount of BTC then Bitcoin would be worth practically nothing at all.
The scarcity creates value.

Bitcoin is great for buying stuff online, Very little fees and the transactions are non-reversible so that protects the sellers from charge backs.
Paypal is all about protecting the buyer but offers 0 protection for the sellers which is why more and more people are becoming reluctant to sell things on ebay, That and my god the fees.
Bitcoin + Trusted Escrow = best way to buy stuff from individuals online.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:51:24
Since $140k is nothing to you, Could you just like give me a shitload of money for no reason at all? I could use it to better myself so it would go to a good cause.
Anything beats throwing it away (investing in bitcoin).

I remember early last year when gox was lagging so bad they where actually starting to fuck up trading, And then they froze trading for a while citing technical difficulties or some shit, I knew right then gox was full of shit and stopped using them.
I told everyone i met to stop using gox but everyone was like "no gox is good, it's reliable dont worry" Well... Those people just got goxed...

I understand that people want to fit in and in order to do that you have to sort of play monkey see monkey do, But you cant just become rich if you are poor, Contrary to what you may think not many people are able to come up from being poor, There is a little saying "It takes money to make money" And that couldn't be more true, Without money to invest it doesn't matter if you have a rich friend that is telling you what to invest in, Stocks are terrible, Unless you have a shit ton of money to invest in stocks your profits will barely be enough to cover the comission fees.

5 years from now i predict Bitcoin will be used just as much if not less than it is now, The only difference will be we will have Bitcoin ATM's everywhere that hardly anyone will use.
It will be sort of like money orders or western union, But that's as far as it will ever get.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:08:46
If i had $100k in bitcoin i would still be smart enough to not move all of it to an exchange at once, I would sell it off bit by bit because it's dumb to put that much money into a central point that could fail.
In fact if i had $100k in BTC i wouldn't even use an exchange i would try to move as much as possible locally to avoid paying taxes on it.

Anyone that actually stored their Bitcoins on gox or any exchange for that matter is a FUCKING IDIOT.
It takes like 5 minutes to make a wallet on blockchain.info or bitaddress and make a backup to a flash drive.

Gold's price in fiat paper money is irrelevant, It was valuable before paper money came and it will be valuable long after its gone, Bitcoins value is pegged to fiat paper when it goes the Bitcoin goes too.

This is why being able to jailbreak a device is important, Because you can't always assume the company that makes the device will allow you freedom to do what you want with it.

I would say your scenario was not as common, It was most likely just people with more money than brains.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:55:36
That's actually a bad idea IMHO, You would essentially be tying your bitcoin address to your name, That QR code would most likely be stored in the credit card companies file they have on you and the IRS could ask for that info from them.
