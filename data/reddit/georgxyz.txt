Seriously? Have you been living under a rock?

But how precisely? Any source? Solidity can be compiled to rootstock VM? Or literally same opcodes?

Interest is money out to work. He's literally putting money to work. Sure he could buy some corporate bonds, let that capital be used by the corporation for growth, then donate the accrued capital to charities, but why not put the capital to work with charities from the start?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:01:16
Source on this? Do you mostly mean that rootstock VM is Turing complete just as the EVM so in theory you can rewrite contracts to run on it? Or is there a closer integration (eg compile solidity for rsk VM, or reuse of EVM)

Please enlighten me on the type of mental gymnastics you're doing here. With equal security, why should I prefer a blockchain with higher fee?

Everytime a story like this comes up, Americans are the first to brag "we got guns so it wouldn't have happened like this in Texas".  It's just fucking annoying.

Hey it's me your dev

You seriously can't see this tanking? Like, you look at the parabolic growth in the last few months a d you can't fathom a major correction? Checkout what happened late 2013/early 2014

What about miners, LN node operators and exchange operators? These are all making banks now, could you imagine if the entire planet was using the network?
My comment wouldn't apply if the entire planet could use their devices to mine, and if only miners were in the picture (eg no LN and Dex instead of ce realized exchanges), since then all of us would be miners...  But there are obvious economy of scale that can be made with mining. So of course our current inflation strategy leads to a small number of winning miners.

What if one day it doesn't come back bigger? This has been true for anything that increased significantly and ended up not going back to ATH....

Welcome to the Bitcoin subs!
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:32:12
Why wouldn't we observe the same wealth inequality with Bitcoin in long-term? Miners, LN operators, exchanges are the new central nodes who profit from this network the most. Its going to be pretty darn hard for the remaining 6+ billion people to ever get to 0.1 BTC. How is this better than the current system?
Edit: I'm a big fan of crypto, but Im not disillusioned thinking somehow it will help the 99% prosper. The new 1% will do whatever it needs to keep control/wealth. Just like the ancient 1% did with banks. It's the human nature. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:38:52
Means hoarding
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:19:06
Huh.. ? Why is this ideal?
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:27:56
One of the main proposition of Bitcoin is that the first layer doesn't change, no matter pragmatism or what the backlog looks like. Solutions are built as second layers. So unless someone comes up with a second layer solution that doesn't require making a tx on the first layer (eg no need to open or close a channel) then my estimation is valid.

9000 is absolutely within the realm of possibility. 2013, went from 100$ to 1200$ in a matter of few months, then decline to 200$ over one year. Similar pattern would bring us to 3000$ over the next bear run. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:20:45
But, they have higher ROI because there are people willing to pay more than what it was 10 months ago. Will that still be the case for the 6 billionth person to join?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:27:08
Satoshi would like to have a word with you..
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:02:48
Let's see. It's going to happen no matter what, I just hope it doesn't end up worst then now
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:19:58
Sure but who gives a fuck? Is this really the most interesting post you could come up with today? Sure he's a dick, move on. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:16:26
But... There's an opportunity cost to not mining even today right? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:41:40
The people invested in it? Like 100,000 of us out of 7 billion?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:23:23
The cause of dot com and 2008 bubble pop were different. Yet both happened. Next Bitcoin bubble pop might be caused by 100 different things: flaw in the code, regulation in US, major exchange hacked. 
I would argue that if coinbase goes the way of mt gox, this could very well bring us below 9000, even if there are more marketplaces now. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:01:37
I agree. Mt Gox could be blamed on early exchange with poor design, poor security, etc. If Coinbase hot (or worst cold...) wallet gets hacked, who the hell could we ever trust to handle Fiat&lt;-&gt;crypto gateways? Can you imagine the headlines?
I don't mean to sound alarmist, I sure hope this never happens. But people who can't imagine Bitcoin falling below 9000 (which we were at barely 1 month ago) dont have a very good imagination. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:56:45
It sure does prevent runaway inflation, but it doesn't mean it's the holy grail. It means that even if BTC is perfectly distributed, the average normal people on this planet get less than 0.003 BTC each. And that's for their entire life span, aka savings, living, buying a house, etc.... Now it's much worse than that because surely it won't be uniformly distributed, the top will HODL their share to hell. So how is the bottom ever supposed to get up from slavery?
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:29:28
But that's too easy of a call. At ant point in time it's pretty easy to say that anything is going to go down (gold, currency, stock) if I don't need to actually commit to when and by how much.... If it's that easy, everyone would make that call and nobody would take the other side
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:30:20
Like... Who gives a shit who Roger Ver is and what he did years ago? Move on, there are more interesting stuff to discuss on here than how much of a dick he is. This is pure circlejerk, we all agree.
We are better than this, let's move toward constructive posts maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:06:20
That's irrelevant, there will still be tx fees so still be miners so still be top %1 growing their wealth faster than us
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:35:33
Sure, I definitely think it's a better system. But it'll be as skewed toward the 1%, might just be a different 1%. 
Also, 7 billion people with 300K tx per day means we can each make 1 tx every 6 years. So I can open a LN channel now and close it 6 years from now....
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:02:45
I entirely agree with this, it was a combination of that and complete FOMO. I'd argue the FOMO now is even larger than it was back then, which means that the price gets artificially inflated past what the technology is truly worth. 
My initial point is that if people can't fathom a price below $9000, it means there are seriously disillusioned people out there, and this isn't reassuring. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:03:56
Because coinbase is trending, lots of new people here and I don't feel that Bitcoin drama and circlejerk is what we should display. Whatever, keep it up guys
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:22:57
Yes, I do agree that this system is better than the Fiat alternative no doubt. But we shouldn't pretend like it's some system that will save 'the people' from the 1%. The 1% will operate all mining and LN nodes operations, and everytime you'll want to transfer some of your non-diluted you'll need to give them a cut. They will be the new banks
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:29:58
Hes trying to make the point that Bitcoin will bring prosperity to the masses as opposed to the banks since us the people got in before... The truth is that wealth inequality is also pretty darn bad with Bitcoin. How would it magically be redistributed to the other 7billion people who didn't profit from this? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:30:02
Good luck with that!
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:46:27
Maybe not actually. I know block reward will go to 0 in 100+ years, but there will still be fees, right? Is your point that these fees will break account for mining expense? If so, why would miners still mine? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:38:18
Let's simply say this is very low quality post, and probably turn off for newcomers

1 BTC = 1 BTC is stupid as hell, but not "invest what you're willing to lose"
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:38:29
Seriously, I'm happy too. 99% of my feed was spammed with the absolute shitties crypto ads. No need to spam regular FB users with shitty projects. Good for the ecosystem

Wow I wish I was as smart as you.  Good luck in having normal social interactions
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:45:44
Legit projects don't need to advertise on FB to total noobs since there's already plenty of knowledgeable capital willing to invest in good projects. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:55:58
Yeah man, fuck off your clouds, "don't invest more than you're willing to lose" makes sense for 99% normal beings.
