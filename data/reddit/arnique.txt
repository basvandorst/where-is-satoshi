Yes. You can't have 2 orders that are selling 100% of the same thing.

Unfortunately most investment firms just end up shorting BTC driving the price further down :(

I remember before the crash watching a Kenyan news story of a guy who paid his dowry using Bitcoin. So clearly crypto was becoming a practical  means of payment before prices tanked
A crypto app that can take on Western Union or Worldremit could revive interest though, coz foreign remittances constitute a big chunk of most African economies.

The real idiots are the people who believe this story.

Did you mean as fake as Wakanda?

This is how it works. You borrow 10 BTC then sell them when the price is 10k pocketing  100k. Price drops to 5k, you buy back 10BTC but only spend 50k. You return the 10BTC and pocket 50k.
Unfortunately very few exchanges allow this.

What is the purpose of deliberately posting a fake news item?

All of my coin alarms fire at the same time every time! This clearly a coordinated pump and dump. 
But no use in whining about it...just follow the patterns and profit with the bots.

If all you're doing is holding btc, then you're doing it wrong. The market is heavily manipulated so the best strategy is to trade like the bots and whales.

It's only Thursday. It will dump as we enter the weekend tomorrow.
Don't buy the top!
