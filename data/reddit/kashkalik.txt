Exactly , put 4k more into litecoin this morning :)

I bought some more at 13680,hopefully we don't go further down than that. I think it is gonna go up like crazy tomorrow, especially once everybody realizes that CBOE futures launching is not affecting the price of bitcoin as much as everybody was expecting

As you all see from the chart, there were cleary many pumps of bcash in the past and bcash to bitcoin ratio went up significantly after those pumps, but the long trend is always going down. Slowly, bcash is losing its position and market cap.
