...well, you could search for only news and set the time-frame for "past hour"!
Just a thought! ;)
Or even better, create a Alert for "Bitcoin" at

That's why you buy LTC and exchange for BTC...

I just withdrew some LTC, no problems.

Looking at the trend line, whenever a key level is reached and support becomes resistance...
When it hit 3000 it dropped back to 2000, when it hit 5000 it dropped back to 3000, when it hit 8000 it dropped back to 5000.
...and now it have hit 17000 and will drop back to 8000-1000?
*(please note the round'ish figures)*
And that's not adding in any of the (possible) future trading effect.
Slam a few shorting attempts from big players on top of that + everyone that bought at 15k+ panics and sell...then we're drooooooping!
...and I'm buying!

I feel you man...
...I jumped from LTC to BTC just after the Future release when it started booming and LTC started going down, fuck me too!
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:52:45
...you won't be when it hits 150k! ^^
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:09:01
Already done?

...so Archer Daniels Midland's (a food processing company) investment service (ADMIS) have decided not to trade with Bitcoin Futures!
What does that have to do with Cboe's planned launch in trading bitcoin futures!?

Me to (ID card verified), and I was stuck on the GDAX verification (passport) on my desktop. Then someone suggested completing the passport verification in the Coinbase app so I did, that verified me on GDAX also. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:26:53
Don't do it!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:19:42
Had he same problem....spinner and timer just keep going forever.
Downloaded the Coinbase Android App and did the verification there, worked the first time.

Think we're gonna see a new ATH before next dip...
...even better!
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:57:18
Yeah, pay off the house dude...
Very solid storage plan though!
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:09:53
...or a few months after the first quantum computers start mining!?

One does not simply use valid reasoning!
