At this stage of the internet in 2015, it's very likely that there are paid trolls everywhere. It's much more common than many can imagine. Take a look at [this 20-year old who got arrested]( for basically trolling too hard. He wrote under many influential handles (including MoonMetropolis, European88 AND Emily_Americana), was a contributor to many blogs/websites basically trolling the fuck out of white supremacists, LGBT/feminist communities, gamers, he played all sides. All of his known handles were very respected in their respective communities.
That is just one person. Imagine what groups of these types of people, working together, can do. There is no doubt in my mind that there are many groups working together on the Internet to influence mainstream discussion, including government funded groups.

“Controlled inflation promotes a successful economy”
This is false, and you have no reference on what defines a “successful economy.”
And what exactly is “controlled” inflation, anyway? You have no idea, you’re spouting something without details. You think there is some sort of “ideal” way to inflate.
The “ideal” way to monetarily inflate would be an even % distribution of the new money to everybody. This way nobody is “stealing” from anybody else.
In fact, “ideal” monetary inflation mathematically equates to no inflation at all; in both cases every individual’s share of the money supply stays the same. 
You’ve been taught that inflation is good, but the benefits of inflation have historically always gone solely to the rich and those in “the injection points” mentioned above. (I will assume you are not rich. Why are you fighting for the rich? **I’m** rich.)
I also assume you are against trickle-down economics. Why are you not against the most trickle-down policy of them all, inflation? Money is **literally** trickling-down.
