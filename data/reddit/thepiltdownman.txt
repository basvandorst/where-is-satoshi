How do you convert bitcoins into the local fiat in each country? Do you open a bank account in each one?
@_date: 2014-06-01 11:57:37
It may be better for you to specify an approximate amount that you would wish to withdraw and ask if people have done similar recently. Many people will be reluctant to set out their transaction amounts in a public forum.

The volume is irrelevant, it's the amount of (artificial?) fiat added to the market that matters. The other exchanges follow in lockstep, and if there are price differences then there are arbitrage opportunities that ultimately diminish such differences.

In the long run I don't see bitcoin and paypal as being comparable. This is due to cost per transaction of bitcoin 
A lot of people think this is low because they only see the tx fee, not the system running costs - currently supported by mining rewards.
The closest thing to paypal would be some centralised off-blockchain service (circle? or somesuch) that allowed users to transfer within between each other.

Thanks for this fascinating analysis 
Has anyone been involved in bankruptcy/fraud legal investigations involving data analysis like this? Do the investigators have the skills to interrogate the data and piece together the circumstantial evidence?
@_date: 2014-06-30 09:57:58


I understood it as higher than that, closer to 4TPS if there's 350 bytes per transaction. But I've also heard 7TPS but I think that is with the most optimistic transaction sizes. What's concerning is that we are already close to 1TPS throughput already:

Mark must be aware of the extreme negative sentiment on reddit and bitcointalk. He will be deeply hurt by the justifiable criticisms of his management and communications and also the personal attacks over his obesity and quirky childlike behavior. In Mark's mind he perceives himself as the one who has been wronged and this stalling and ambiguity is likely his form of revenge.

The fact that it was censored lends more credibility to the theory and conclusions. Clearly there are people who are keen to keep the mtgox story completely private, and while it may benefit this bull rally in the short term, it will do irreparable damage to bitcoin in the long run.

He's so sneaky and sly, he runs rings around intelligent people with his ambiguous and far fetched IRC statements. Imagine what it must be like for people in the legal system in Japan having to deal with him speaking a second language about some new and complex software. This is why I think there is a slim chance of the legal route producing a positive outcome for depositors.
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:25:29
Evidence is emerging, documented in the "willy report" that the run up from low 100s to 1000+ was an illusion created by mtgox fake trades. It's also quite possible that the price April 2013 was also artificially manipulated. Without this the 106x increase would likely never have happened.

It's worth bearing in mind that the fiat system does not need the notes, coins, ATMs and bank branches any more than bitcoin needs ATMs and physical coins. They exist for the convenience of people who prefer the old ways, but could be completely eradicated if energy efficiency became the primary motivator.

The more I hear about this, the more I doubt that the state and legal apparatus in Japan and USA will get to the bottom of it. It's hard to envisage them putting the vast level of forensic data analytic resources onto it that would be required to uncover the truth especially as Karpeles appears to be an evasive character and absent of any kind of conscience. I am not so optimistic that the truth will come out.

This income is generated through inflation and so you don't see it directly  just as with fiat inflation. It's also hidden by the mostly rising price of bitcoin. When the block reward diminishes to a negligible level, the miners will have to recoup costs some other way, most likely through higher transaction fees at which point the true costs of running transactions will become visible.
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:33:48
The market wouldn't be destroyed. It would be a great buying opportunity and people on the sidelines would be incentivised and get the chance to buy into it and actively start using bitcoin in real life. 100Ks or millions of bitcoins in cold storage are doing no good to anyone except buy and hold speculators.
