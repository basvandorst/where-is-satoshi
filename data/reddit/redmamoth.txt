I genuinely can't wait for this to go live, the Bitcoin network needs it yesterday. I know adoption will be gradual but Lightning is game changing.

Yeah me too.  Stick £20 in a channel, whats the worst that can happen? So I lose £20, at least I could say I took part in testing the TCP/IP of our generation.

Hi Sara,
I don't know if this has already been mentioned by someone else in here, but did your husband ever have a common password he used for things? Name of a child, pet, etc?
I have a Ledger Nano S and it also has functionality to 'hide' wallets. What you could be looking at is your husbands 'hot' wallet for day-to-day spending, he could possibly have more stashed away behind a passphrase. Take a look at the transaction history and see if he was sending funds anywhere else regularly.
If you go back to the first screen on the device (after you enter the pin), then go to settings -&gt; security -&gt; passphrase -&gt; set temporary, then enter what you think he may have used as a password, you never know you may just hit the jackpot! You can try as many passphrases as you want, the balances will just be 0 if they weren't correct.
Good luck and just to re-iterate, never give any information on phrases, seeds (the 24 words on the paper), or pins to anyone. If you can, try and keep some bitcoin on the device itself, if only $100 worth, you never know what it may be in 5yrs time.

Couldn't this period of no backlog increase segwit adoption though? Meaning the next backlog may not be as harsh? I, for one, have just moved all my funds to segwit because it's finally cheap enough to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:51:47
Firstly, what you are doing is incredible and I'd love to be in a position to do the same. Especially in a world where the media likes to associate Bitcoin with the criminal underworld.
Please consider a donation to Tree of Hope,  the work they do is amazing and very close to my heart.

I just bought a Nano S, waiting for it come in the post. I have a question though, the seed word and passphrase allow me to restore the wallet in the device goes missing / kaput. Does that have to be done on another Nano S, or can it be recovered in any wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:54:12
Probably a complete noob question; but can the blocksize be increased temporarily? Then reduced one Segwit and LN are fully adopted and it's no longer needed.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:31:58
I was kind of interested in what they were doing here, at least for putting small amounts away for savings. But then they put it behind their paywall so I completely lost interest. You either have to refer x people to revolut or pay for their premium product (min 1 yr). What happens to your coins after 1yr if you don't keep the premium product?

Define 'cash out'? 
For me, I'm not in to cash out for GBP. I'm in so that in 18 years time I can pay for daughters (and her siblings) education.... with Bitcoin.

Yeah, i'm now thinking I should give half the private key to my parents and the other half to my inlaws, just in case.

Why is biometrics not a thing with bitcoin wallets? It should definitely be a thing.

I'm fine with that.

I know right! I've justed ordered a safe from Amazon along with a fire proof container. Any other things I should think about? Laminating it maybe? It's laser printed.

Tell me about it, I tried to send some gold to my friend in Germany and the fees were astronomical.

If I was single and didn't have a family to consider, I would do the same. But, I would make sure I could afford the repayments if everything went sideways.

This sounds like a pretty insignificant vulnerability to me, especially when you consider some of blunders by the likes of Apple lately. Clearly the dude just wanted some publicity.

Ok, so that's the first time I updated my Nano S firmware and it was painful! I had to remove all the apps, then about 5 attempts and 5 laptop reboots later I eventually got it to go on. I really hope the new native app improves this process.

I'm in a similar boat to you, bought 1BTC back in 2014 when it was about £270 (I'm the UK). I was saving for a wedding so couldn't afford more, but I just had a feeling I'd regret not buying at least one. I've now got 1.11 sitting on a paper wallet thanks to BCH. I'm in for the long hall now, moon or nothing. I should really buy a safe and fireproof bag.

Bought a single coin over a few months early 2014, total cost £280.  It's now stored offline until my kid(s) go to Uni (~18years), I'm hoping it will pay for it, and then some.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:37:31
No, my confidence is very high, I just can't afford to invest any more at the moment.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:40:49
I'm just waiting for 1BTC = 1BTC, i.e. we stop comparing to fiat and BTC can be spent everywhere and used to pay off my mortgage and send my kids to Uni.
