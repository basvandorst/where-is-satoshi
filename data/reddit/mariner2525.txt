yes, i just DON'T release the escrow and nothing happens. Just like now - what if you don't pay your 15 bucks the pizza guy?? The deal is off. But ask yourself one question how often does that happen? How many time did you NOT pay the pizza guy? How many times did you not pay a booked before hotel in a foreign country? In fact, if you do decide not to release your escrow for a hotel room in Rome, it will make your life even easier - just NOT release the crypto you had escrowed a week ago - go looking for another one, that's it. 
I don't see what the problem in this "human" thing of yours. Judgement the disputes? There won't be the disputes as such that's the beauty of it. You escrow 1 crypto and then it's either you release it or not release it. No disputes at all, because this way of escrow would be a condition of the deal at the beginning. Release or not release. Simple as that.

At this point there is not much to use. Without escrow ability the crypto is like a Ferrari on a muddy off-road terrain - nice to look at, but nothing else.
Tell me, developers, how come that a crypto project can safely swap values between addresses in a trustless system, but still does not have a  mechanism to safely escrow the values in a trustless system to safely meet the conditions of the swap... before the actual swap? A universal mechanism which would fit for all the blockchains just like TCP/IP is universal for all the gadgets now. Isn't it a obvious that that's what's missing?
Why are any coin still dependent on some third party  - centralized and mostly criminal - exchanges when it can easily become the market???

You are right! 
I think we should launch a flash mod: whenever you pass by a bank on the street - through some sort of garbage to the bank's door. Any garbage really - a candy foil, a burger you didn't finish - just through it in a bank's direction.  Let the bank in your town be the most littered areas. Let it rot there. Let other people know why you do it - because all the banks are dirty thieves and criminals who simply do NOT get a proper punishments from the government, so you do whatever you can to fight it.
Let drown the banks on the planet in garbage. 
What do you think, friends?

ERC tokens might be good, but I'm talking about the the universal standard embedded into all the blockchains to the point, that even when a new blockchain is created the escrow ability is there by default. 
You know, like if you were to make a new computer today, you wouldn't be creating a new token in order for this computer to use TCP/IP. 
 
@_date: 2019-02-09 14:15:42
Seems very similar to what i mean. Although they seem to creating a new os. I'd rather leave things as they are with the exception of adopting a new standard which would be as invisible as TCP/IP is now. Keep it as simple as possible.

Ok. You sell pizza for 1.5 crypto. I order the pizza by escrowing 1.5 crypto on the escrow address you advertise (which could - and i think should - be in human readable format, like emails now). Now, you see that the funds are escrowed (not paid, but escrowed only) and you deliver pizza. I get the pizza and, if the conditions are as agreed upon  - i simply release the escrow. 
And all that from the comfort of my crypto wallet.

I'm a user, not a dev. And I speak as a user. And being a long time tech user I speak about what any user would love to have. An average user does not want a link to Github - he or she wants more simplicity and less applications. He or she would love to be able to just agree on a deal over some Facebook or even a telephone conversation first and then simply escrow whatever funds he or she agreed upon in their coin wallet. And when the pizza arrives  - simply release that escrow. Done.
And no links to Github.

All we need now to break free from the current criminal system is just one additional layer to all the blockchain projects - Decentralized Escrow Peer-to-Peer protocol. A blockchain language.
Something like TCP/IP was to Internet the decentralized Escrow protocol option shipped by default will turn any blockchain to a market place in itself - able to swap values between other markets/blockchains. Any type of values and all of it goes p2p. Real estate, services, voting in any form... or whatever you'd like to digitize as some form of token and declare it as value.
You create value and you declare it and see if the market accept it as a value.
It's a declaration protocol, the one that always come before the actual deal. We need that intermediate layer before the actual swap of values.
The nodes operators get the fees, which will insensitive  nodes proliferation of any given blockchain due to competition for best security &amp; speed with other crypto, while week and bad blockchains will die out in natural selection process.

While you have a perfect point as a whole, but it's the last argument I can't agree - I think it does make a perfect sense for the banker's cartels to accumulate as much crypto as possible so when it finally becomes the media of exchange  they, just like now, would have most of it. Now, where am I wrong?

Eric Wall, a cryptocurrency researcher:
    “Just read an estimate from the TABB Group (in a $5,000 report) that OTC crypto markets exceed exchange volumes by 2-3x. That would mean 1 to 1.5 million BTC is traded OTC daily. Strange it’s not visible on the blockchain, which shows a meager 100,000 a day.”

I know what you mean. Although my idea is ALL-SWAP. Say, i have btc, and you have your bungalow - you can rent it to me for 5 days using the Escrow layer.... and i only press the "Escrow" button in my wallet when i actually arrive to your bungalow. OR if your bungalow is so popular you might want to easily tokenize it (right from you wallet or a IFPF-like portal, or smth like that ) and put it out to the Escrow layer so I could buy it and get my share of the pie... I'm talking about the easiness of both swapping any value and the easiness of creating that values too. 
I have put a post in DGB thread here on Reddit, and i posted it in r/bitcoin as well.  i will try to put a link to that here too... (not sure if Reddit rules will allow )

Coinmarketcap is no longer reperesents the true picture of crypto market. The real crypto volume is at least 2x larger than reported.

Evidence is this: 
Sentiment is main thing on any market. JPMorgan and other bankster pigs will not show to us  that they are buying all available crypto. They are - and have been - purchasing all the crypto in the shadow, while we are being distracted by totally centralized CoinmarketCRAP.
BTW - it also shows the evidence that  we should go peer-to-peer ASAP! Just like Satoshi meant it to be - peer-to-peer cash, peer-to-peer values swap....peer-to-peer all swap
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:22:40
thank you! i wish i could code to implement them
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:57:47
... for example: 
Imagine if all the wallets on Earth of every coin on Earth had one more button in them - an "Escrow" button, which would be as natural to any wallet as the "Send" button now.
If blockchain can safely swap values between addresses in a trustless system, why don't we use the same  mechanism to safely escrow the values in a trustless system to safely meet the conditions of the swap? ... and then we don't need exchanges any more. Then you have a total peer-to-peer society simply because every single person or entity on Earth could now safely agree and then safely swap values between them.
