when will you have more PS4s in stock? cuz this is where i'm buying it
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:56:10
i hear you, but the problem is that all the items you listed that apple "created" are FAR more popular and well known then their original counterparts... 
@_date: 2014-09-03 16:13:43
yeah i just got mine to.
 
how is this different from coinbase?
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:42:31
cheers mate
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:52:56
do you only need to report gains if you've sold?
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:29:09
what site should i be using to buy/sell/monitor prices? i have some btc in coinbase, but whats the deal with mt. gox? how come they have different prices.
 
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:18:49
woah thanks! now i gotta figure out how to use this!! 
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:08:41
does this require me to meet in person? a bank transfer (like coinbase is doing) would be ideal.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:59:49
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:12:49
thats what i'm saying! i want to buy .01btc
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:56:10
does offline paper wallet mean electrum?
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:49:24
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:02:09
so i generate a wallet on bitaddress.org, then send my btc to the SHARE bitcoin address i see there? and if i buy any more BTC i can continue to send them there?
and if i NEED to use them, i import them where? and then i have to send them to a NEW wallet if i don't use them all. correct?
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:21:48
thank you all you generous redditors! now i gotta figure out how to get these bitcoins into my coinbase account, right? each site has a separate wallet, correct?
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:08:35
this is annoying. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:59:16
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:48:12
so i can send my coins to my electrum wallet, and keep them safe there.
 
now what if my computer crashes? 
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:01:29
no its down
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:43:37
you can't buy through coinbase right now anyway so...
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:14:32
what do you mean "paper wallet"? i currently have mine in coinbase. is that bad?
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:14:33
what exchange should i use?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:36:16
do i have to sign up with my coinbase email?
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:54:50
dude just go to the bank. 
 
if it WAS related to bitcoin let us know
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:31:53
nope. just the localbitcoins.com site but you have to find a seller who's willing to let you do it
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:43:06
so if i download a client on my computer, i can send all my bitcoins to that wallet and keep them there until i want to use them
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:36:41
that makes sense
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:35:40
did you sign up with your coinbase email?
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:30:36
whats a good exchange to sell?
