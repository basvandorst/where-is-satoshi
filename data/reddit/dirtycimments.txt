I don't know why you're telling this to me.

If bitcoin(or derivatives) are made illegal, IOU's, either between people or in the form of tabs at bars and restaurants. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:38:01
They can pass any law they want, doesn't have to make sense or even be something the courts can use.
What I'm saying is if they pass a law that just says "bitcoin and other crypto currencies are now illegal", even if I agree with what you say, what I'm saying is that that law now has other implications. IOU's and bartabs are basically ledgers of stored credit, and so should be illegal as well.
And to be completely sure, I am not advocating that, I want bitcoin, crypto currencies, blockchain and distributed ledgers to be legal.

Good point! 
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:52:00
Theoretically, what can be done to avoid this vulnerability? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:57:30
Copied my response to a similar reply. 
No, but if you had 1btc(worth 4000usd) before, you now have 1btc + 1forkcoin. That forkcoin is not going to have a lot of value, but it might have some. So we have now inflated the total value of your assets, and the amount of inflated value you have is in direct relation to how much btc you had. 
Again, everything I say is under the clause that i might have misunderstood the technical side of it all. Having said that, this all sounds like inflation to me. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:18:35
Isn't a stock split à bad comparison? Isn't that more akin to increasing the 21 million btc limit? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:38:47
Inflation is not always controlled. I don't understand the significance. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:40:11
So, as far as the hardware side is concerned, any forks start from zero? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:05:55
Right, so my understanding that if I have a wallet with 1btc at the moment of forking, I will have 1btc and one fork coin, even if that fork coin loses almost all its value, it's still value created from nothing, right? 
Wouldn't this give companies that have large sums of btc an incentive to fork, as long as the btc survives with its value intact (atleast not lose more value than what the fork coin would earn them)

That's what I'm afraid of. Also it undermines one of the basic principles of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:33:15
Thanks for answering!
So a refill is always an On-chain transaction.
Only speculation on my part ofc, but I guess on-chain tx's are going to be pretty expensive if LN gets widespread, which in a sense is okey as since they'll mostly be used to validate LN channels. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:21:00
This might happen with forks, but it might not. With stock it's different. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:24:07
"If not, then this is just like a new, detached altcoin launch, with a distribution equal to existing BTC." 
- Good explanation. I agree that btc as such is not getting inflated based on this argument. Perhaps I should rather say that I'm worried that all these forks and alt coins are actually making things worse for cryptocurrencies as a whole. 
"Does a new altcoin launch equate to an increase in the BTC limit?  I personally do not care about almost all altcoins with the possible exception of Monero, ZCash, and MimbleWimble coin whatever that becomes." 
-This was never my point, rather that forks with copied wallets are" money for nothing" schemes, and therefore akin to inflation or ex-nihilo money that banks create when you take a loan, which is a bad thing.

@_date: 2017-08-19 10:24:43
So, basically, if allow me to paraphrase : I'm right, but it's a non significant value and mostly media hype? 
Could it not be orchestrated to be a problem? Or a way for big bitcoin hardware operators to cheat the system and cash in on forks? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:06:56
But btc does not exist in a vacuum, and the amount of new coins that you now own "thanks" to the fork is in direct relation to btc, so in many ways this is inflation of the money (normal inflation is the inflation of prices with respect to the value of the money) 
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:57:45
I don't understand, why is perceived value not inflation? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:58:12
Hasn't this only happened by chance so to speak, not as an imposed measure (as compared to stock)? So who's to say a fork won't happen that has a huge hardware player supporting it, which mean it has perceived value, btc will get fall in value, but perhaps less than the new coin rises in value. Total effect = inflation. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:59:37
Isn't that exactly one of the reasons bitcoins got developed, to avoid people (banks etc) creating more money from nothing. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:17:12
It will allow btc to grow, as long as every event is still looked at and analysed. We are young, but we can't count on future size and strength to solve today's issues. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:15:41
I would agree with this if the wallets weren't being copied. The amount of new coins you get depend the amount of btc you had at the moment of forking. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:12:00
At a technical level, if I'm mining (and therefore participating in the hardware side of the economy), and a fork happens, is my hardware now participating in the forks economy as well? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:54:34
Is that why people are comparing computational power of the btc network? To see if any real abandonment is happening? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:51:29
That's pretty well explained, thanks! 
@_date: 2018-10-10 08:50:15
Hello all.   
About Lightning network.   
What i understand is this. You need (at least) two people to start a multsig address, atleast one person needs to put in initial funds. Transactions then happen off-chain.   
My question is : Can i refill the multisig address? All posts and videos i've watched talk about initial funds, but none ive seen or read talk about refilling. When initial funds run out, do i need to restart a multisig address with new funds, or can i refill? I imagine the refill needs to be validated on the chain though.   
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:17:23
This looks very much like P-hacking. But then again, i'm not an economist, so i wouldnt know.
@_date: 2019-01-28 20:19:13
Id love for this to be true, but i'd love even more to be SHOWN that this is true, rather than just "I believe".   
Don't accept something as truth just because it "feels true enough". 
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:33:30
What am I looking at here? 
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:54:13
Only drawback (atleast ideological, for me it doesn't matter), the transaction is not anonymous. 
@_date: 2019-09-01 11:57:34
wait, why are crypto fans saying this is a good thing(If it were to be true i mean)? Shouldn't we want for crypto to have legal tender status (as an ultimate goal i mean)?
@_date: 2019-05-15 10:47:39
The goals laid out in this article are all right. But I think fiat's flawed banking system has already primed people of different accounts having different functions, spending account, savings account, credit card etc. Meaning that top ups are, I think not a problem. People already think of their credit card and their cash in the pocket as largely different things. Having a "fortune" btc wallet and a "spending" LN wallet doesn't seem as a problem. Tx fees are the big problem in that setup though. 
An amateurs two satoshis on the matter.
