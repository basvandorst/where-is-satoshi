No you have to create a new wallet and move your funds but you can't use lightning without a segwit wallet anyway..
edit: I'm wrong
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:51:22
Will this cause a problem? I guess it would. As more and more people die bitcoins will just go missing forever.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:13:02
Stop using coinbase. Use an exchange that pays the fee for you and then use a wallet where you can actually determine your own fee. You'll find a £2 fee works most of the time.

and what gives gold its value?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:02
It can't grow at this rate any longer it's not possible!

Trade fees too high

Was this just a shell to get your public key out there hoping some bitcoin billionaire feels generous?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:02:08
Yeah but... it's still unconfirmed as we speak wtf.!? Made a larger transaction with a 0.72p fee and it's already fullly processed. Lovely.

You sent it to this address? 1Q5ZeHykA9ACHNo5A7pktA4FVpFm3uzqSP . If so then just give it time and it should be fine.

New guy here. This recent dip has actually made holding bitcoin alot easier. For some reason this dip has made me stop caring and I don't bother checking the price anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:30:08
I'm sorry I'm testing on it but to join a node i had to pay 0.1 btc which is $1.5k.. This seems a bit steep no?
Edit: my bad that's how much BTC is on the lightning network I own. 
How could I go about withdrawing this btw?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:49:15
People got to use it though for it to work. It's not magic.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:30:34
Dude it's hideously overpriced as it is.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:36:52
haha wow that's every response my Dad gave me last night when I told him to get into it. "It's like Tulips"... "It's a pyramid scheme".. etc etc.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:29:19
If you buy bitcoin and don't hold it you'll seriously regret it in 1 year... or 10 years when it's used for everything.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:17:43
It's true. Analysing the graphs, candles etc you're hoping that when you sell there's many other people that are thinking just like you are which hopefully should make the price do what you hoped it would.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:24:36
Someone codes a game then sells it digitally via steam with no real material object to hold its value then gets real cash. It's a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:33:40
Definitely not going to happen. A delusion
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:12:00
People like you need to stop seeing the price of a coin and start seeing it in percentage gains and losses. You're actually an example of why the value of bitcoin needs to be shown in satoshi's or mbtc because you see $20k and think it's like a share where you have to buy one and assume the price is insane.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:14
And it's dropping!

Bcash is the final form

The fees won't be the death of bitcoin. The people who don't update at soft forks will be the death of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:57:12
Can someone explain to me a hard fork? Wouldn't it split the bitcoin community.. would it also reset how many coins you own or what?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:24:33
My ledger nano suggested yesterday I pay £200 in fees. Changed it to £2 and it went through in a couple hours. Not fast at all but definitely not disappointed after hearing all the shit here about how transaction fees are so high.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:56:11
This was just a shell so you could paste your address amirite?

Before you use lightning though make sure you move to a segwit address
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:52:34
Can someone explain to me why this sub sounds seriously like a pyramid scheme? The whole hodl thing, the whole "we're still early adopters" all seems quite fishy. It's more an approach to lure people in to increase the price than joy for bitcoin itself.
I invested in bitcoin and have been constantly thinking and talking about it to people I know but recently someone I've been speaking to told me to get off this subreddit because it gives a serious confirmation bias and can be very risky.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:06:08
I want to but the hardware wallet is taking fucking ages to arrive in the mail. I'm getting more anxious every day!
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:38:40
Why does something physical have any more value than something digital?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:10:33
It's the same with gold though. You have to cash out to make money.  Gold only has its value because society gave it value.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:18:13
Dude forgets to mention if it were to get to $300 a coin it would need a market cap 50x the size of Bitcoin's with it's current circulating supply or 16x to get $100 a coin. It just wont happen with Ripple... not any sooner than bitcoin. It's way more likely a coin that isn't in the top 10 multiplying that much over the next 10 years than any of the ones below bitcoin. If bitcoin itself was to grow to the market cap required for Ripple to be worth as much as he's saying a coin then it'd be around $600000 - $700000 a coin.

Wallets really shouldn't give people the option to use a legacy address. Especially newcomers. Most people, especially if you put legacy as a higher choice or on the left, will CHOOSE LEGACY if they have no idea what they're doing. They're already doing something they're probably very unfamiliar and nervous with so they'll choose what appears to be the safest option. I blame wallets and exchanges for this massive fuck up and I blame everyone on here who could have changed to segwit ages months ago but didn't. You're catalysing bitcoin's death. If this implementation in exchanges and wallets happened sooner maybe bitcoin could have been grasping long enough for longer term solution to be implemented. All I can see now is bitcoin dying.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:00:28
I thought it was 95% of nodes updated to segwit but only 10-15% of transactions are segwit meaning people need to start using segwit.. coinbase needs to start using segwit...
