I am surprised this not has been posted here by yet, and maybe rightly so... I am HIGHLY suspicious of this "service".

The fact of the matter is: Who cares.

Much agree. Such thought. Well article. Wow.

What proof is there that BTC is actually "burned"? How do I truly know the private address doesn't exist?

They're probably getting a mini-flood right now, and still working on a viable email response to give all customers.

Is BitStamp any good? Looking for a secondary source of buying BTC; Using Coinbase currently.

I'd highly recommend that you guys employ some anti-brute force mechanisms. Even employing a 30 minute account lock-out + email/sms message to the account owner would go a LONG ways.

Welcome to life. Seriously. When you see the News in general, it's not the good stuff that has the tops hit or the most press: It's the bad stuff. Wars. Mass shootings. Missing planes.
Good news doesn't sell. We're pretty much conditioned to smile at good news but go crazy over bads news. It's not a problem with Bitcoin or but us as human beings in general.

I think this summarizes it:

Since Bitcoin is now property, doesn't that mean they can no longer consider it money laundering?

Yeah, I work in Support. Every once in a while, I choose to just ignore the detailed documentation 3rd level support spent hours making to solve situations such as these, and just "wing it". Sometimes these issues take me all day to resolve, and we end up just giving the customer a brand new PC.

Hey, you gotta make sure you set those &lt;p&gt; tags up correctly! 	
	&lt;p&gt;In light of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox&amp; operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Best regards,&lt;br/&gt;

Nope, this morning the only articles I see so far are bloggers catching up on yesterdays "news". No new articles, nothing about the recent gains. The only news they want to report on is when Bitcoin value falls.

In all honesty, if this was MY HDD with 13 BTC on it, I would give 0.25 BTC to 1.00 BTC for being such a kind person... Depends on how rich I am to have had 13 BTC on my HDD in the first place

This has already been discussed in another topic. People need to simmer down on this: It's simply being lumped into the same EXISTING law.


@_date: 2014-03-11 14:15:51
My impressions were that it's all custom/proprietary. Paid out of pocket.

Debatable, but most will tell you it's because of MtGox 
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:04:36
Eh, if you read through the two laws mentioned, I don't think so.


All this statute says that if a single transaction is going to exceed $10k, you have to report it (I assume ahead of the time of transaction). *Edit* - The statute also states "or who receive this amount through two or more related transactions". Pretty gray area IMO, but still doable.


The law simply states if you're not licensed to deal with the various transaction limits imposed in said law, then it's an offense. I don't think the law would kill LocalBitcoin: It would just require that those who work through LocalBitcoin actually get licensed to deal with money transactions.
*Edit - Further Reading*


If I understand this correctly, if LocalBitcoin became a licensed money services business, it could potentially grant registered users the ability to work as "Authorized vendors" for them. Since LocalBitcoin doesn't actually hold the currency on hand though, I wonder if they could become licensed though or if they could appoint vendors.

This is why 1) My coins are stored in a paper wallet and 2) The bank account linked to my Coinbase account always has less then $100 spendable in it.

Note: I'm not trying to be dick'ish here (well, maybe a little, in that mood). I just usually hold Bitcoin users to a higher standard ;)

Except that all cryptos are pretty tied together. If you look, you'll see all coins are popping downwards right now

My favorite quote (facetious):


@_date: 2014-01-24 14:45:15
But you know, that's what I told myself back when it was $13.50 a BTC.
I should alter that I guess: I live within my means. I have a day job and have enough to pay for my house, wife's college loans, and still get a coffee once in a while.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:46:42
Umm, no? Because all of them are going up? Not to mention that Dogecoin also had a massive drop overnight.
Frankly, stop acting like it "Us vs Them": All cryptos are tied to together. I have both Dogecoin and Bitcoin in my wallets.
