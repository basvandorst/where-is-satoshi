That's what I think too.  In june 2017 I estimated that Bitcoin would likely reach $10K by the end of 2018, then it would crash in 2019, and then it would slowly march to $100,000 over the course of 5-10 years.
Instead bitcoin reached 20K in 2017 lol, and at that point I was hoping bitcoin would crash sooner rather than later so it can rally to 100K MUCH sooner.  It seems that is kinda happening just as I hopped, but you still can't help but feel a LITTLE nervous haha.  
As long as Bitcoin stays above $7K, and bounces between 9K and 12K for a couple months; I will be happy.   That shows a lot of maturity in this market.

That is a very privileged and "first world" way of looking at Bitcoin's utility imo.
1) There is no way you are telling the full truth unless it was a VERY limited trip (or you got lucky).  I regularly travel all over Europe both for business and pleasure, and I always have to make sure I have Cash on me if I want to guarantee I can eat at a restaurant.  Seriously, in Europe (especially Germany) there is like a 50-50 chance a restaurant will accept a credit card AT ALL.  I also had a co-worker with me last time and he couldn't withdraw ANY funds because of some ATM error with his card.  He relied on me to keep him going, and then paid me back after the trip.
The fact is credit cards and banking accounts can be EVERY BIT as annoying and complicated to use as Bitcoin.  Sure once you have your entire life set up by your 30's, credit cards appear easy as pie.  But please don't tell me you forgot how hard it was to get your first credit card, or hoops you had to jump through just to set up a bank account.
With Bitcoin you download an app and it's there!  You have an account!
2) Furthermore, the example you gave is limited to the idea of a trip - but not moving countries for an extended period of time.  Moving a substantial amount of permanent (not credit!) funds between countries is an incredible amount of work and red tape.  Westerners take for granted how united the countries we freely travel between are, but most of the world is simply not like this.
With Bitcoin your mobile wallet works the same everywhere you go.  It just works.
3) Don't forget too, that everyone is not required to use the Bitcoin-qt wallet meant for the technical elite.  Just like financial advisers/managers and credit card websites make navigating financials easy for simple people, places like Coinbase do the same.  Nobody needs to understand TX fees or anything like that if they just use coinbase.   
But Bitcoin is nice because it ALLOWS you to CHOOSE if you want to use a centralized system for ease-of-use.  For those who understand the system, they can finally fully control their financials themselves.

Jeez I cannot even imagine that happening.
I do however remember when it went from $1200 to $300.   I actually didn't waver at all back then, but it depressed my brother for sure.  Now he is happy though haha!
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:48:52
Could be next month, could be 2020.
But it's not "when", so much as "when it deserves to."   I think Bitcoin is solidly worth ~ $5,000-10,000 as a longterm store of value.  But it doesn't really deserve to go at all higher in the immediate future.
Before another bull run: 
1) Bitcoin's regulation worries NEED to stabilize
2) BCH and BTG need to die in a fire (with any other malicious forks)
3) Bitcoin needs to have it's lightning network prove itself
4) Bitcoins NEEDS to become accepted by another mega-entity (Amazon/ebay/etc).
Large masses of sheeple won't want to adopt Bitcoin until it eliminates its most hostile competition, proves it can solve its scaling issues, and receives some degree of regulatory approval.  It needs to prove it is truly here to stay as more than just a speculator's asset, and that people should bother investing in it over altcoins.  If that happens, it will likely go all the way to ~$120,000 (But it's an IF, and it might be a while).
P.S.  Keep in mind that while I think highly of myself, I am not an expert ;).  Just some other guy throwing out his 2-cents... erh... Satoshi's.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:17:10
LOL I know that mentality all too well.  
That would be like if I bet on a "classic" fork of a smart-contracts crypto that starts with an "E" (And ends with an "thereum").  If I did that I would have likely gotten stuck in a bear trap and lost good money...
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:50:32
I suspected that you were just merely making a (valid) point, but even so I like to be fairly aggressive in my responses on purpose.  I want people to directly challenge the points I make, and I like that you kept a level head.  A lot of people simply get mad haha.
But yes I do agree with you on pretty much all counts, and if you look at the points I made - I was indeed also alluding that I think some people simply can't be bothered to safely handle their finances on their own.
However I resent the assumption made, that the media also often makes; that Bitcoin is complicated or hard to use.  If you are a competent person, it really is often easier to use than standard banking.   And thinking longterm, there is no reason Bitcoin (or other cryptos) cannot simply be the backbone of standard-type banks and credit cards.
In fact I will always have a credit card for that extra buffer and customer support, but there's nothing stopping it from being anchored to DASH or Ethereum instead of fiat.  
Simply put - Bitcoin does everything better, but changes nothing in how you interact with transactions  if you don't want it to.  I would compare it to the financial revolution that happened when governments switched from gold to paper money.  To people that understood the fundamentals - it was a huge deal.  But to most people it seemed like nothing changed ;).
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:32:43
I expect some regulations, but if they are reasonable...regulations are good.
Don't forget that France is making a power play right now.  To call Germany "The leader of the EU" is a little silly when France seems to be at about the same level of leadership...

@_date: 2018-01-24 16:57:16
Yeah I have seen the demonstrations.  The lightning network seems very impressive, and it's growing quite fast.   This could be an important step in reassuring investor confidence once people stop panicking that governments are proposing regulations.

I honestly think you are mostly right - no tin foil hat required.
Half of the banks refuse to admit that their entire business model is about to be made partially obsolete, and the other half smell the winds coming and want to make sure they are one of the banks left standing in 10 years.
The banking industry isn't gonna die, nor should it; but it will probably become quite a bit smaller.  Not as many banks will be needed in the future, and the ones left standing will be those that loaded up on Bitcoin.

This is it.  This is the prep for transitioning from the Institution Investor phase to the "Awareness" phase.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:41:57
It's been shown numerous times, and was obvious from the start in my opinion; that BCH is just an angry rebellion by the losing side of the the "What bitcoin really should be" debate.  
Bitcoin isn't the fastest or cheapest, but it simply doesn't need to be (at least in the short term).  That's what the majority of the community basically decided in 2016.
Bitcoin is the original crypto, and therefore the "digital gold standard" all other cryptos measure themselves against.  Its greatest asset is its established reliability, and it can never be as good as DASH (for example) at being a payment system (Even if that's what Bitcoin's initial goals were).
Bitcoin Cash was doomed from the start because it's an answer to the wrong question.  if you want to fix Bitcoins speed and scalability issues, you would simply use an altcoin lol.  Tons of altcoins fixed this a LONG time ago in far more fundamental ways than lazily increasing the blocksize.  Forking off of Bitcoin makes absolutely no sense if your end goal is the "ultimate currency."

I could NOT be HAPPIER!!!!!!!!

@_date: 2018-01-25 18:03:40
Nice job only quoting a small part of my statement.  I said:
1) Bitcoin can't compete with DASH at a COUPLE of things.
2) I never said that couldn't change too.  Bitcoin might eventually beat it at everything, but that's not gonna happen in the foreseeable future.  Lightning is a nice development, but it's not a magic wand; and it has some BIG downsides...
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:54:35
I really could be wrong, but so far I still see this January as a necessary cool-off period for the market.  This is an important time to shake off the weak hands.
It will be hilarious if by March Steam, MS, and everyone else recommits to Bitcoin.  If the bull-run re-ignites that quickly I will for sure laugh...
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:05:26
Not shilling at all, just stating that DASH is better at speed and privacy.  These are boneheadedly obvious facts.
Am I shilling if I say Siacoin is better at storage?  Or are you going to tell me how Bitcoin will beat Siacoin at decentralized storage next week?
Get over yourself.  Bitcoin is made outdated and weaker by people who blind themselves to areas it needs improvement...
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:30:19
But it really doesn't in terms of the easily enforced taxes.   Don't forget that many European governments don't have redundant "Tax returns." 
if Bitcoin hypothetically replaced USD, then nothing would really change.  Income taxes would still be withheld by your employer, and sales taxes would simply be tacked onto every purchase.
In fact it would make these types of taxes MUCH harder to fabricate.  Sure there would be other taxes that the government would basically have to abandon, but who cares?

If it weren't for 401K's and storing wealth, do you really think the stock market would be valued at what it currently is?!   
For instance why is AMD worth $12 a share?   Why not $100?  Why not $2?   Do you think anyone actually did the math to work out why each company is worth EXACTLY what it currently is?  Most of that is fluff.
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:19:38

I agree - let's be cool ;).
But come on man, it is a FACT for now at least.  Again, Bitcoin may innovate and beat DASH at its own game; but it certainly won't be better speed/security next week...
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:44:38
150% agreed my friend!
A cool down period is incredibly necessary right now, but not just to get rid of "weak hands"; but to get rid of all of these bloody Ponzi Altcoins and ICO's.
I have no problem with at least a dozen non-BTC crypto's, but that's about it.  I would say 80% of the coins in the top 100 right now are just complete wastes.  I mean Pot coin and Hemp Coin both exist?!  GO AWAY!
Hopefully Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, PIVX, and more will all fall of a cliff behind Bitconnect.  Meanwhile hopefully some actually common-sense regulations will be decided upon by governments and calm people down who think crypto could ever be banned...
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:57:42
Not even close.  In fact I said to myself: "I won't worry unless it goes below $7000, and I won't SERIOUSLY worry unless it goes below $5000."

@_date: 2018-01-24 16:46:00

We are not there until crypto is unavoidable.  When you see DASH ads on NBC.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:13:17
I never said DASH will "win."  Your assumption I meant that does reveal some common insecurities I often see in crypto forums though...
I simply brought up the obvious FACT that one thing is better at a couple things than another thing ever could be (Again, short term at least).  Becoming bogged down in arguments like these is a complete waste of breath.

BTC *is* a store of value - talking about the price is fine.  That's how humans think.
P.S.  Most people I see have no intention of selling most of it, they are just interested in when they can cash out **some** to finally pay some bills.
@_date: 2018-09-30 19:26:29
Have a life outside of money.   Even though I think Bitcoin will continue to gain value over the next 20 years, I still only invest as much as I can stomach losing - and I do other things besides watch the price.
\-Everyone should put 1% of their liquid savings into Bitcoin.
\-People who can stomach risk, have a lot of extra money, and believe in Bitcoin should put 5-10% into it.
\-Developers and true believers should put 20-35% into Bitcoin.
But no one should be putting so much into it that they have to worry about losing their lifestyle.  No one should be obsessing over the price besides traders.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:10:38
All joking aside, I would bet money the floor is between $2,900 and 5,500.  The longer we wait for capitulation, the higher that floor will be.
In other words, if we don't hit the "final crash" until December/January - then I do think \~$5000 is the floor.  However if some big crash happens in a week or so, expect us to dip a little below $4,000.   
But I do not really see any chance of below $2K anymore - this crash has gone on for too long and people seem to finally be maturing in their opinions.  However I would not be surprised if the altcoin market drops by another 50-75%.
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:13:58

Yeah I already posted in the Btrash sub that they have till December (at most) to finally dump their bags.
After the hardforks in November, it is conceivable that Btrash will have less than 2% of the hashrate of Bitcoin.  At that point I am fairly confident a lesser Mega-Miner will decide to finish off BCH.
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:55:11
People aren't dumping shitcoins *just* because of the "network effect", they are doing it because Bitcoin is also proving to be superior.  It's unhackable, uncontrolled, and its code base is incredibly stable and reliable.  
This didn't use to be the case in 2014 TBH.  Bitcoin was never terrible, but it really did have bugs and speed issues that made me throw some support behind DASH.  However at this point Bitcoin is faster than every other coin since 0-conf is pretty much secure.  Additionally there are now better wallets available, and soon it will likely have the best privacy features as well.  
It's kinda over - BTC fixed whatever issues anyone could argue they had, and there are clear signs of exciting upgrades in the near future.
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:05:39

Honestly I don't bother people about Segwit.  All major businesses should of course use it - it's MUCH cheaper.
But most wallets (even good ones, and my android wallet) still do not accept Segwit.  We need better wallets, and frankly normal transactions are still really cheap.
@_date: 2018-09-15 05:49:57

@_date: 2018-09-11 18:36:56
Time horizon for what?   I think people need to define several "rules" for themselves when it comes to holding Bitcoin.
1) When do you plan to take some profit for safety reasons, and also just to reward yourself?   
For me this is just about every time BTC hits a multi-month high.  I cash out some gift cards for groceries.  Then again I am a miner, so I always have more BTC coming down the pipe to replenish my stock.  I have to emphasize that this is important to do in case of Black Swan events.  Then at least you made some money right?
2) How much money would it take for you to really cash in say 10%, 25%, or 50-67% of your crypto?
   For me this is tricky.  In general I want to cash in 10% when it can get me enough money to live comfortably for a year, 25% when it gives me enough funding to really try for a dream business or job, and 50% when it would be enough for me to not have to work again (I would still work of course, but at least I wouldn't need to worry anymore).
3) How much BTC do you plan on holding forever?  Or more to the point, how long do you plan to live? ;)
   I actually think this is the most important question to ask yourself right away, and that's because this question dictates how much you are willing to spend in the near future.   If you won't retire for over a decade, then you probably don't need to HODL more than 1-2 BTC.  But if you plan to retire in around 5 years, you may want to cling to 10+ BTC ASAP so you can hopefully retire around the next major Bull Run.  
For those wondering, I did some math a while back that (assuming things go well) more-or-less suggested it would take about 16-17BTC to be considered Wealthy for life if Bitcoin truly succeeds in the next 10 years.  I know that doesn't sound like a lot, or a long time - but it is my friends.  
\-What were you doing in 2008? That was 10 years ago.  
\-17 BTC sounds cheap if you know it will be worth $10,000,000 each some day, but are you are actually sure it will be?  Are you actually willing to sacrifice over $100,000 right now with the knowledge that you *cannot touch it* for the next 10 years?
Food for thought my friends...

Exactly.  BTC ain't dropping below 3K, but the marketcap may lose 90% of it's value before the dumb money is finally gone.  We need to get to at least below 150B total, and 100B is a realistic target.

That is what I am alluding to.  Put some money every month into the S&amp;P 500, and that will likely make 10-20% per year plus dividends. Oh, and you don't need to worry about 90% drops in value lol.
Bitcoin is an excellent hedge against the S&amp;P 500, and I still think it's an incredible store of value that will likely outpace all other investments over the next 5 years... But don't pretend it's the only option people.

When I see walls of text in conversations on Reddit I usually expect the normal BS: "Banks fail! People rise.  Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders 4 lyfe!!!"
But I pretty much fully agree with you - well put bud.  The only tweak I would make to your "prediction" is that I think it's actually going to be in-between your two "ways."  I think there will be another crash, but it is likely to happen in the (no offense) lesser yet still powerful European and Asian countries all over the world.
I expect some major country(s) like Italy, England, Japan, India, Korea, or Mexico will go through a currency and/or debt crisis at the same time.  Sorry, I just don't see the US/China/Euro completely collapsing.  But one of them will probably catch incredible backdraft from he economic explosions on their border - and that will make people buy Bitcoin.
I do legitimately think we have grown a bit smarter from both the Great Depression, and Great Recession.  To be *very* clear - I am not saying the Fed, IMF, or morons in charge have figured everything out.  But it does seem like humanity has learned enough of a lesson to not completely fall apart like in the 30's.  However we haven't learned enough, and so I do think there will be something a tad worse than 2008, but it will happen for the most part in the countries that are not "Too big to fail."
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:42:56

What are you talking about?   You can literally own stocks, go get that piece of paper and hide it in a safe if you want to.  It's just most people are not competition (or care enough) to do this.  Same with Bitcoin.
Mainstream (Including traditional investment firms/banks) getting into Bitcoin is inevitable - this is going to happen whether you like it or not.  But this new world will still be vastly superior to the previous "Pre-Bitcoin" world.
@_date: 2018-09-03 07:47:06
My Heart says the same, but my brain says $3500 is a very real possibility.  
It seems like $6K is crazy defended, and yet mainstream doesn't care about Bitcoin once again.   That bodes well for a "bottom", but remember that this bottom could drag on ALL 2019 before we hit $12K again.  This could take a while to build up steam (Although I think 2019 won't be that bad).
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:02:26
I totally agree.  Bitcoin is a replacement for Gold, a check on the banking/fiat systems, and a speculative asset.  All three.
This arguably places bitcoin's "true marketcap value" at 5-20 Trillion dollars.   I am not convinced it will replace everything though (not yet). 
I will play devil's advocate against the OP though and say: Arguably aren't all financial systems still tethered to USD, Gold, Oil, and Land/countries?  Couldn't Bitcoin *possibly* just become the Mega Settlement layer of EVERYTHING?  You could still have the USD, and credit cards lending on the USD - BUT then you could have the USD settled with Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:11:41

The world is not truly "just" or "unjust."  I think that's obvious that everything is mostly chaos.

Relatively speaking, yes.  Personally I don't think this "bear market" will last even half as long as it did from 2014-2016.
It should bottom out sometime this year, and slowly climb till $30K.  Once it hits $30K the fomo will likely start up again.
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:54:32

Intel is about to lose a huge tech advantage once AMD hits 7nm, and AMD has had the privilege of support from Alt-miners for years.   Intel would be stupid to not get themselves some financial support from miners while they lose CPU marketshare.  
I mean honestly so many of these tech companies could make piles of money in the mining market.  It's getting a little ridiculous that Bitmain still holds this much power lol.  Do Intel/Samsung NOT want to make more money?!

I am honestly not sure what your point is.
There are people in other countries who now are starting to depend on Bitcoin, and while most people in the west are completely spoiled - they are also *trying* to vote out the BS.

I think Tone Vays put it best:
  
"Every year startups think they have finally come up with a solution that will finally make a Token be the "Crypto killer app."  First it was short block times and a larger supply, then it was privacy, then TPS, and now governance.  But what if the killer app was just the fact that it was completely decentralized and uncontrolled by any single entity.  That IS the killer app."
@_date: 2018-08-16 15:00:43
No it isn't.  Taking into account all available Dark Web Merchants (that you can), the ranking of most used crypto is: Litecoin, Dash, Btrash, Ether, and dead last is Monero.
Monero's horrible speed, bugs, and wallet support make it the last thing besides unknown coins for "dark" transactions."  Why?  because you need to actually do transactions well before you worry about anonymity lol.  It's not a coincidence that LTC and Dash are the coins of choice for "Dark Merchants."
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:17:42
Hope this is how things work out, but keep in mind that there is a chance BTC could be crashing half as fast as before as well lol.
Either way I think the bottom is in the $3000-$3750 region if it collapses again, but there is a chance $6000 is the bottom.
@_date: 2018-08-18 02:41:53
Never underestimate a Man's Ego or Laziness, especially if that Man is never told he is wrong.  
1) Just like phone companies believed their internal "experts" when they said "The internet is a bubble, but Intranets will help our efficiency!"; big banks believe their own Yes-Men when they say "Bitcoin is a bubble, but blockchain is here to stay!"
These people are only aware of a world where life is easy and they are always right.   Their egos have blinded them to reality.
2) It would take an enormous amount of effort to actually stop Bitcoin - way more than most people realize.  In fact it is almost impossible if you live in a democracy.  Bankers are insanely lazy.
You should watch Andreas Antanopolous' videos about Bitcoin.  He goes over a lot of this.

Maybe I should be more clear:  I think almost all "Day Traders" who do trades every few hours are indeed just lucky.

@_date: 2018-08-10 17:24:25
It's not that simple.   
Do I think the price will go up? Yes, and of course I hold some because of that.  However why else do any of us hold ANYTHING?!   Stocks, USD, cars, houses/land, and even GPU's are all held on to largely because you believe they will hold their value for a certain amount of time.  That is the only reason to hold ANYTHING.
But the idea is not to just "sell at ATH", you hold Bitcoin because there is a chance you will never need to sell it.  Bitcoin is **deflationary.**   It's price *has to increase* over time or it dies.  Period.  Eventually Bitcoin will probably level off between $100K and $300K, and then just increase in value by \~5% for eternity until something replaces it in the distant future.
The bitcoin **protocol** should be thought of as the base immutable settlement layer of a new financial network.  There is so much more that will come **on top** of this.

@_date: 2018-08-10 17:09:39
The main use case for any longterm currency is Store of Value.  Bitcoin has arguably JUST achieved this.
Next up is medium of exchange, but this is never more important than store of value.
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:01:25
There's no doubt the stock market will need a correction at some point in the next few years, but then again that's obvious.
However a smart person would ask: How much higher, and is it justified?   It might be.   
\-The housing market isn't a complete casino anymore, and "smart money" is abundantly aware of the (real) 5% inflation going on.    They need to put their money somewhere besides Bitcoin (gold doesn't seem to be an option anymore).
\-GDP.  Really?  America's GDP is not a perfect metric anymore lol, this isn't the 1800's.
\-I think a currency crisis is much more likely than a Stock Market crisis for now.  I mean the US' politicians have basically given up on ever spending reasonable amounts of money, and as such the fed will eventually just have to print the debt away.  Hope I am wrong about that of course....
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:25:01
I am somewhat convinced one will happen next year, but yeah I only give it a 25% chance of happening this year.
Again though, more good foundational news has happened this year than any other year since I have been in this space (2012).  Bakkt will likely get an ETF by the end of next year if no one else does.
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:16:26
And you just described every Bitcoin naysayer.  If someone writes Bitcoin off, it's because they don't know what it is...
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:25:29
"(1)" No it wouldn't.  People use Bitcoin for its brand name and unrivaled network stability.  Atomic Swaps won't change that.  Store.  Of.  Value.
"(2)" It failed because it was unnecessary and poorly thought out.  If Moore's Law FINALLY  catches up, and/or the network decides TOGETHER It is finally worth bigger blocks - then it WILL happen.  But not until then!  
2MB blocks were a band aid no one could agree on - Not big enough to make a long term difference, and too small to be worth the trouble.  In fact a 100% adoption of Segwit does a better job than 2MB or even 4MB blocks would ever do.   So 2MB felt like an arbitrary compromise between both sides, and if it's arbitrary it isn't worth the trouble.

This is a silly question.  It reminds me of people 10 years ago that said: "Should we really be pro globalism?"
It doesn't matter if you like or dislike globalism - In a world where I can be in any square foot on Earth in under a day, globalism is inevitable.  The correct question is: "How do we best work with globalism for our county's betterment?"
The same is true of mainstream money and Bitcoin - Wallstreet WILL get into crypto eventually.  It doesn't matter if or if not we want this because the end result is the same.

Yeah I mean I think everyone keeps analyzing this bear market the wrong way.  Everyone keeps showing previous drops of 70%, 80%, and even 95% - but back then Bitcoin WAS the market.
What matters now isn't how much Bitcoin drops, it's how much the market drops.  2017 was an insane year of speculation over complete and utter BS.   This market needs to crash 85% just like it did in 2014 - but that doesn't mean Bitcoin (or even some of the "good projects") needs to drop that much.
Verge needs to go to ZERO.  IOTA needs to go to ZERO.  Neo, EOS, and TRON should have never even existed - AND YET THEY ARE STILL IN THE TOP 15!  As long as garbage like this is around, the crash is not over!

Nothing lives forever.   But what is the actual time horizon for BTC?
Idk, I would say at least 20 years if things continue to go well, but most assume over 100 years.
On the one hand money does change about every 100 years, but on the other hand there is no real reason I can conceive of to move past Bitcoin.  It's a settlement database, and we can build other systems on top of it for a VERY long time.  I am a tad concerned there are not enough Bitcoins (21m is very little), but that could probably be solved with various forks in the future.
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:51:46

In all seriousness, I think the biggest continual mistake "Bitcoin Talkers" keep making is not mentioning Bitcoin benefits ALL political ideologies.  
This isn't "A libertarian's wet dream;" this is also a Socialist, Federalist, Republican, Democrat, and especially communist's dream!  
Bitcoin makes centralized entities more accountable, civilians harder to track, and gives every user direct control over their money.  Everyone should want this revolution besides very specific people at the top...

I will say the unpopular opinion that it isn't exactly like Paypal.  With Bitcoin you can move your money off-bank and store it privately on your own wallet.  
You cannot do that with Paypal - it's either on that "trusted" third party or back to a bank (another third party lol).
So let's not pretend this isn't better than the previous system, but it still would be WAY better if people would just use real wallets...

Decent quote.  Banks aren't going anywhere, but they need accountability.

I think this story is a perfect example of what Bitcoin truly is.  Look guys - Bitcoin isn't going to make banks obsolete, and that is because most people are stupid and need smart people to watch their money for them.  
What Bitcoin truly is, is a PERMANENT check on centralized power.  If they get screwed up, or too greedy - we can switch to crypto when needed!

Savings don't need to be spent regularly - they are savings.  If you want "cash-like money", Bitcoin will NEVER EVER eclipse the usability of DASH/Pascal/Litecoin.  EVER.
So the one thing Bitcoin has to do is maintain its stability and brand name as something "You just can't kill."  
P.S. Notice I never said Bitcoin will be impossible to spend, only that it might cost 1-10 cents per transaction for the foreseeable future.

That's not entirely true.  The actually good (win most of the time, and have for years) day traders are really just super conservative traders that are 1) good at controlling their emotions and admitting when they are wrong, and 2) very good at making sure they minimize loss when they are wrong.
Many day traders are just gamblers, but if you are careful and not greedy - it's really not an impossible thing to be good at.

I won't confirm the company, but a friend of mine was in a top level conference call at a Mega Corporation - And someone openly asked: "What are we doing about Bitcoin and the disruption it could bring to multiple industries?"
The CEO of the company unmuted himself and said: **"Blockchain is what's important.  Bitcoin is not worth talking about, and that will be the official view of our company.  You will never be able to convince me that some program can't be hacked.  They can always be hacked.  But we are watching blockchain closely."**

I tend to agree with Tyler a lot, but not quite always.  I do think his insistence of "going below $1000" is a little too dogmatic.
Depending on how you draw the hyperwave, it could be 50-100% higher.  Additionally Bitcoin still acts in "orders of magnitude" more-so than linearly in price movements.  The difference between $1500 and $2500 is INSANE if you are talking about Amazon stock, but not really worth mentioning in Bitcoin ;).

My money is on some fiat collapse in Europe or a major Asian country.  Something like the British Pound falling apart after no good resolution to Brexit, the Chinese Yuan collapsing, or Italy abruptly leaving the EU and crashing the Euro's price by 10-20%.
To be clear, none of these would be as bad globally as 2008 - but they would highlight that no Fiat is safe.  That's the message people need to internalize for 50% of the population to decide they need their 0.1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:38:12
Keep in mind that $20K would be a new ATH.  It doesn't need to go to $100K for it to be doing better than ever.
What I can't decide is (assuming there isn't a world meltdown) what the last "Fuck it I will by some" point is.  The higher the value, the less likely people are to FOMO onto BTC without thinking twice.  At a certain point people will see a price and go "No way!", heck most of my friends did that when it was over $4K last year!
Once we hit $15K again, I think there is a very real chance that we might see a fast run-up to between $25K and $50K - but after that it will likely just be a slow climb for a long while until there is a paradigm shift.  
Once people start talking in bits or Satoshi's instead of Bitcoin, then we will likely see another mountain climb.  We need the social generation to graduate high school ;).
@_date: 2018-10-09 17:50:21
It's all about timing.  If we stay above $6K till Decemeber, I will say the bottom is basically in.
But we aren't there yet friend.  One thing is for certain though - If we never go below $5,600, then Bitcoin is INCREDIBLY healthy!  That would mean only a 70% drop after an absolutely insane bull-run, and point to us likely reaching ATH's again in 2019.  But I do think 20x's in a year are over either way.
@_date: 2018-10-07 05:22:37




















I would like to see this as well actually.  Please post here if you do it!
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:20:49
Agreed.  I feel like this is the final Bulltrap coming to a head in the next 2 months.
It will crash abruptly, and lower + faster than the "trapped bulls" expected.  But I also don't think it will fall quite as low as some of the bears think.  If everyone is waiting for $1000 BTC to buy, they also won't sell at $1800.
A lot of the alts will implode though.  Once bitcoin goes below $2,700, many will think it's destined for $1000 and dump their alts.
@_date: 2018-10-09 05:13:26
Pain or time?  Which one?  
Either way we will be $5000-$7000 at the end of the year.  Likely $15-30K end of next year.

I mean I was mining Dash in 2014 while it was still called Darkcoin (it's actually older than Monero).  It's usually in the top 10 too, but man are there a lot of shitcoins ahead of the good alts right now lol.
It's just so hard for me to use Monero after being used to the speed and stability of Dash.  I really don't see the point, but at the same time Monero isn't a shitcoin either imo.  Oh, and neither are stupid like Zcash lol.
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:52:25
It has a Satoshi quote meant to poke fun at people who still "don't get it."  Thus I am saying people who don't "get Bitcoin", aren't worth our time - because only a fool would not understand how needed bitcoin is.  Only a fool would look at all of these examples of hyperinflation, and then still not understand how necessary bitcoin is for our future.
I am saying Bitcoin is the cure to a fundamental flaw in fiat.  A flaw we have seen many times in history.

I would accept 0-confirmations on Bitcoin as long as the transaction was less than $20, and I saw that the transaction had propagated to 5 or more nodes.
There really is almost zero risk on a network this robust.   However there are almost no other networks I would do the same with, ESPECIALLY if they aren't on the top chain of their chose POW algorithm.

@_date: 2018-06-09 20:11:34
Hey don't misunderstand what I am saying - I have no problem with Monero existing.  But I do think its value is incredibly overstated in the West.  The reason it is overstated though, is because westerners rarely NEED to hide transactions.  We only do it when we make our bi-yearly illegal transaction.
However in Eastern Europe and South America half of your transactions might be worth hiding from your government (And there are people doing way more illegal things too honestly).  DASH offers faster-than-LTC speed, and it is anonymous.  Hence why it is so popular.  However people still use LTC on the Dark Web the most because speed and immutability is all that matters to most people (Including criminal enterprises).
But again my initial point - Until Monero gets atomic swaps, it is almost useless imo.  DASH is anonymous and it doesn't suck to use!  Now if Monero becomes easily swappable with BTC, then yeah it will act as a built-in coin mixer.  That would be sweet!

I mean Bitcoin IS adopted imo.  There are just different tiers of adoption:
1) Niche Darkweb Currency (Silk Road, no competition) 
[$100-$1,500, reached in 2012-2014]
2) Last resort niche world currency (Venezuela, replacing some desperate stores of value) 
[$3,000-$25,000, 2017-Now]
3) Unbanked and Back-Up World Currency (TBD, replacing USD/Euro use outside their main territories)
[$30,000 - $150,000, 2019 or 2020?]
4) Longterm Store of Wealth / World Reserve Currency (TBD, replaces Gold and all non-internal Fiat)
[$200,000 - $10,000,000, 2030? ]
Personally I think  is very achievable, and almost definitely going to happen.  However I am skeptical about Bitcoin hitting fantastical values any time soon.  
But either way Bitcoin is already accepted for everything in most Western countries if you know how to convert it, and it is already a standard in South America and Africa.  Bitcoin has been successfully adopted already! :)

"impossible with any degree of accuracy."  It's not impossible at all, just complex and too hard for most people to do repeatedly.
All I said is that I think Bitcoin is going to continue to crash through July, and this is faster than most people expected.  I also said if this happens it should be the "bottom."
I will freely admit if I am wrong, but I am curious - how would you define me "being wrong?"   My opinion will be different 2 weeks from now, and that is because things will be different in 2 weeks...
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:05:55
I completely agree.  Most ads for exchanges should ONLY show Bitcoin.
When you show 10 currencies in a commercial you are making people think: "I can't get into that, what if I choose the wrong one?!"

@_date: 2018-06-27 16:30:04
In 2017 people seemed to forget why every previous big altcoin made its own tailored hashing algorithm - it wasn't an arbitrary decision.  If Litecoin, DASH, Monero, Zcash, or Ethereum didn't make their own mining system - they would have been hit with 51% attacks in the first 6 months.
Therefore people also need to fundamentally understand that if you decide to go against consensus and hardfork a coin, you better have an incredibly good reason for doing so.  Your reason needs to be so good that you match or beat the consensus within a month or so.  Otherwise you will hemorrhage hashing power until the established miners decide to finish you off.

I mean it really depends on how expensive your tastes are.
I like nice things, so I don't really ever see myself retiring.  But I would assume most people think "retiring" requires $1 Million if you want to live well for 30 years.   So yeah - then you should have 5 BTC just to be safe if you want to retire in a decade.
P.S.  Keep in mind that there is no reason you cannot live to be 150 given modern medicine.  This is another reason I hate this question.  For instance I listened to a podcast describing people in England who saved hundreds of thousands of Pounds, and retired at 60.... Now at 85 they are broke....

I think it's becoming increasingly obvious that Bitcoin will flash crash down to $3200-$4900 before rebounding back up to $5-6K and sitting there for a month or so.
These lower floors need to be retested again, and everyone around here knows it whether they consciously realize it or not.  Nobody can say why Bitcoin ever "deserved" to go above $5,000, and everyone is also bragging about how they can't wait to buy Bitcoin at $4K.
I expect HIGH volume once we blow past $4,900, and increasing volume as we near $4K.

It is directed towards a guy who doesn't understand why 0-conf on a network with an immense amount of hashing power is more secure than VISA (If I remember correctly).  It IS more secure with 0-conf on Bitcoin.
If you don't understand what I am saying, I don't have the time to convince you.  The intention of that quote works well when applying it towards how people perceive Bitcoin next to several examples of hyperinflation imo.
In my opinion Art is about eliciting a reaction in the ballpark of some intended emotion (although many would argue a reaction is all art should aim for).  I intended this to get people to either see Bitcoin as a joke, or (hopefully) realize immediately that people who "don't get it" aren't worth our time.  
I honestly still can't believe like 5% of the people here immediately think I am poking fun at bitcoin.  Like how could a 1 Quintilian note from Hungary next to Bitcoin mean anything bad regarding a non-fiat currency?!  I actually think it's because the price is "down" right now - people get defensive when we are not shooting for the moon.  Understandably too...

Scaling is always a major concern for anything that needs to store ALL info EVER to be done over its network on ALL nodes.
Bitcoin is the best at doing this (besides maybe Pascal, but Pascal can only really do money + super simple contracts).  Consider that Bitcoin is almost a decade old and only takes up around 200GB of data.  On the other hand Ethereum is 3 years old and takes up over a 1TB!
So Bitcoin IS the best at scaling.  We will definately be able to handle adding a few hundred GB every 5 years, harddrives will keep up with that (and so will data limits from providers!).  But the second you need to download like 20 blockchains, is the second the overall network will not be able to scale.
That's why layer 2 is so important, and that's why "good altcoins" should be MUCH smaller in marketcap in Bitcoin and stick to VERY niche usecases Bitcoin could never come close to doing.

I still don't quite know what you mean.  Bitcoin is built on incentives that keep the network secure.  It is only gets "bigger" if people can profit by expanding it.
Plus everything you just mentioned (land, music, etc) can have its signature anchored to the Bitcoin network.  So There doesn't need to be a bunch of redundant blockchains, most things could use Bitcoin.

TX/sec is an outdated metric repeated by people who fundamentally don't understand how these things work.
1) Layer 2 payment systems, batching, and further enhancements (Like Schnorr) make "effective TX/sec" impossible to measure anymore.  I could batch 1 million transactions 7 times per second!  Millions of lightning payments can be settled 7 times per second!
2) Atomic swaps add a whole new layer of complexity as well.  Lightcoin and Monero could add as an "offramp" to help when the BTC network is congested, and if Pascal is ever able to be swapped with Bitcoin our "scaling problems" are basically completely solved.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:43:29
I find these statements hilarious.  What does "Threat to Fiat" even really mean?

On chain transactions won't ever come to an end, it will just be an expensive option anyone can use outside the system.  
Consider that right now there is literally no way to send money P2P.  You need to pay a 10% fee at a bank, or slowly over months withdrawal thousands of dollars of cash to hand over in person (very dangerous!).
Bigger blocks, greater segwit adoption, and other scaling solutions like Schnorr can easily keep things under a $1 to send for a decade.  However yes it may cost you $20 and a couple days to send $1,000,000 - but no one will be able to stop you from doing it.

Exactly.  No one controls it, and no one can take it from you (Though they can still kill you lol).   
That has never happened before, and we need it.  It's the "back up currency" of the world.  It may never hit $1 Milllion, or even $200K - but it doesn't matter, Bitcoin is already kinda doing it's job as long as it can stabalize between $10K and $100K....  It's that reminder in the back of every banker and despot's mind - "This currency is there waiting if I abuse my power.  People don't *need* to use *my* monopoly money.  They have a back up plan if I get out of control."
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:22:32
500Kb, 1MB, or 4MB - they all would work.  However 1MB is the STANDARD, and Bitcoin is about maintaining and building on top of a global STANDARD.
Please people - stop with useless Blocksize BS.  1MB is plenty small enough to eventually allow Moore's Law to catch up for phones.  
Heck I can fit a full node on my Phone RIGHT NOW (It has 300GB of storage).  Within 5 years most phones will likely be 1TB, and this won't be an issue anymore.

Exactly.   My Dad recently told me that some of his colleagues have almost randomly started talking positively about Bitcoin, and before they were Way more skeptical.   According to them, it's because they have slowly been learning about how the financial systems in our world actually work - and the farther you get down the rabbit hole, the more you realize the use case for BTC is incredibly valid.
Heck I remember myself going down that rabbit hole over the past 5 years.   At first bitcoin just made complete sense because I have always believed that debt enslaves you and other libertarian values, so I really didn't ask a lot of questions at first.  But then in 2017 I heard the federal reserve was technically a private company/trust, and not actually part of the US government...... It was down the hole from there... 
@_date: 2019-02-03 20:20:01
It will take over LTC, XMR, and DASH most likely (and almost anything similar).   There is just no point in using these other bogus coins that do the same thing except with less security and decentralization.
Now fun coins like Doge, or more lofty projects like Siacoin?  Idk they may find a use at least midterm, but I am skeptical anything out there right now will last in any meaningful way.
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:45:52
How will they succeed?   There an infinite number of ways they can fail.
Look at Venezuela, Iran, China, etc - none of them can get rid of Bitcoin.  Their people are still using it if they want to.
As for major governments trying to literally "kill the network," look at my other answers on here.  In short, there aren't even enough ASIC's for sale to buy them up immediately and 51% attack.   The energy costs to 51% attack bitcoin are hilariously huge as well.  It's just not doable - but yeah, they could kill most of the altcoins.
@_date: 2019-02-16 02:18:12
Actually this is a brilliantly funny meme.  It seriously seems like the stages of Bitcoin for 90% of people are:
1) That sounds weird (Or some say - that has to be a scam)
2) Oh, people are making money.  I better buy an altcoin.
3) Maybe I can make one myself.
Step 4) I accept Bitcoin as the real one.
Various stages of Bitcoin can take varying amount of times for different people.

To all of the people saying "When it's ready," I think you may want to hold back on some of the snark.
I, like the OP - want this ASAP.  Schnorr should bring down TX fees decently and make Bitcoin the best privacy coin (without any room for argument).  Furthermore the whole "segwit debate" weeded out most of the stupid from the BTC community, and so many (including me) expect Schnorr to be adopted much quicker once "it is ready."
And on a more important note:  I think we should all want a ready Schnorr before the next bullrun so BTC can better withstand a spam attack without fees getting above $5, and so we have decent privacy by the time "Blockchain Analysis Companies" begin attempting to track everyone.  Segwit is doing its job, but it could use a little help.

I did, let's see:
"When you are withdrawing your funds from lntip bot, you are asking a service to pay you.
If you were transferring directly from one wallet to another, it would be instant.
Since you are transferring from a service to your wallet, there are any number of reasons why that service may fail, including it just being shut down randomly."
Hmmm, at no point do you directly say it was the bot that failed lol.  Did you read your own post?  Thank you for NOW answering my question, I will message the bot owner.

What do you define as "US Failing."  LOL what is failing?!   It's a country of 400 Million individuals spread across many smaller governments.  California alone could win a war (both militarily and economically) with many European countries COMBINED.
\-Purchasing power is best in the US still
\-UBER, Lyft, GM, Tesla, Apple, AMD, Intel, Tinder, Facebook, Twitter, Square, and the list goes on FOREVER.   
 Innovations happen and continue to happen in the US despite us supposedly being stupid.
\-The US' debt is bad, but many other nations are in substantially worse straights.  Italy for instance is likely about to collapse and drag most of Europe down with it.  The UK is also probably about to go through a currency crisis.  Paris is fucking on fire lol.
*I am the one who is using facts, not you*.  If a debt crisis happens in the US it will ***after*** much of the rest of the world has already been hit by harder ones - I mean China is literally building entire Ghost Cities to artificially prop up the economy -**Entire Cities**.  Literal (and a lot of them, not 50) Nazi's are marching in Poland, Hungary, Germany, and Greece.   
Finally, comparisons to Rome are incredibly hilarious.  Rome stated they were on an inevitable decline due to the "feminine youth and bad economic policy" in 200BC - they still had 200 years before the "republic" fell, and even after that they were the  super power for another **400 years**.   So if the US only has 600 years left, I bet that sounds good to them lol.   America is nowhere near being "usurped", especially when people like you can't even say what a final "fail" would even be. 
Bad things may happen, but the US will survive hard times.  Put yourself in the shoes of someone in 1937 New York - and honestly tell me things looked better then.  It has been WAYYY worse.
@_date: 2019-02-03 20:17:08
Monero is arguably already less private than Lightning.  To use Monero, you need to transfer funds into monero - that makes your transaction very easy to identify (especially any large ones).
However no one notices BTC transactions, there are just to many to see, and over lightning no one on either end knows each other - WAY more effective than Monero.   The addition of Schnorr will make it Bitcoin indisputably better.

It has been perceived to be, but it's not as private as most think.  I forgot the whole story, but I know someone (or some people) figured out a way to unscramble the transactions before (I think) 2016.
Additionally there was a recent kidnapping where a billionaire's wife was ransomed for $50-100m Monero (I think)... and most security experts said that was 1) Almost impossible since it would be really hard to get that much XMR on short notice (10% of all XMR lol), and 2) it would be crazy easy to catch the culprits since that much movement actually would be traceable with the on/off ramps.  Heck many analysts think XMR is unsecure for even smaller transactions because there are ALWAYS on/off ramps into BTC.
**With BTC it's very doable to track a** ***specific person if*** **you put a lot of effort into it, or they are lazy.  But it is incredibly hard to track someone who is very careful, or millions of people at once (almost impossible).  Add lightning or schnorr and it's way safer to just use BTC.**
@_date: 2019-02-12 21:58:48
It wouldn't really be more transactions than Visa though - everyone would still have to wait 10 minutes for a confirmation.  0 conf is only arguably safe on Bitcoin, DASH, and PASC... but DASH is centralized, and PASC is unproven so they don't really count.  
Still, I have come to accept that the greater market is never going to accept 0 conf transactions as "safe" even if they are.  People will only switch to Bitcoin if it is 10x better than existing systems, and so yes LN is needed to literally be faster than credit cards.  Without the speed, the greater "capacity" over VISA does not matter.
@_date: 2019-02-06 02:52:12

Honestly, a "game-breaking unfixable bug" is really the only thing that would end it.  Everything else will just pause its climb or keep it from becoming a world standard.
-US or EU banning BTC wouldn't ban it from other countries, and so it's price wouldn't go to zero.  It would likely drop rapidly, and then rebound to $1000 for a year or so.
-A new gold standard would definitely slow down BTC's mass adoption, not prevent it.  However Bitcoin would still "live" as a back-up currency anyone can use.  
Bitcoin achieved the status of "The gold standard of the Gray market" and "World Back-up currency" the second it hit $5K and survived several hardforks and countless social attacks.  I just don't see that status ever being lost.  
Now it is certainly up for debate if it will ascend to any other "tiers of adoption" though.  There is no guarantee it will ever hit $100K or $50K for that matter.

"I think."  "Find a way."
I am tired of phrases like this.  There have been people trying to kill bitcoin for 10 years, and it's not dead.  Every year it gets harder to kill Bitcoin.
The US isn't banning anything - this is a Republic made up of 50 states (And more territories).  The Federal government can't ban jack sh*t because it would impede on States' Rights, and the individual states are incentivized to accept Bitcoin so they can attract "blockchain jobs."  Not gonna happen in the US.
Now China?  They basically have banned Bitcoin, and yet people still use it a ton.  This is a global world, if a few countries ban Bitcoin it won't do bloody anything.  Bitcoin is propped up by the fact that there will always be competing countries that do not ban it - and so Bitcoin lives on.
Finally, people need to stop assuming evil and all-powerful people exist in democratic governments.  Most people are good, most people don't care about Bitcoin, and most people will advocate FOR bitcoin if they think it will make their country stronger - and it will.  Just look at the US politicians pushing tons of "pro crypto" bills every month....

Correct.  If every millionaire in America wanted a full Bitcoin RIGHT NOW, they would not be able to buy one.  People who HODL understand this (usually, some are just trying to get rich quick lol).

I can't speak for direct Bitcoin Miners, but I do mine Monero (that I sell for Bitcoin every time it peaks tri-monthly).  I am still not losing money mining with 0.07 KWH in a cold area of the world.  All of my rigs have already paid for themselves, and they heat my house too.  
It would take $1000 BTC for me to consider shutting these down, and that price would be incredibly brief.  Not to mention even at $1000 BTC, the difficulty would adjust and I would likely end up not making much less than now TBH.  I am making more Monero/month now than before, but a Monero is worth less - hence how mining was designed to only be doable for those (like me) who have the best location and energy.
So yeah, I don't really see myself shutting it down. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 00:10:26
If that was it's only use, it would be worth 1/10th per ounce what it is now.
@_date: 2018-03-25 02:14:55
I 100% agree with your statements, but nevertheless I am looking for an unbiased answer to my question.  Of course the taming of the frenzy has led to lower fees, but Segwit (imo) has clearly greatly assisted in lowering fees.  And so I am curious: If Segwit (1.4MB effective) helped this much, would 1.5MB blocks cut down fees by a factor of 10? 
P.S. When you say "New tech" do you mean just off-chain payments, or there other out-of-the-box enhancements being proposed?
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:37:07

@_date: 2018-03-21 17:28:12
Have you read the Bitcoin whitepaper?   Are you aware of how revolutionary cryptocurrencies are?
If you answered "no" to either of those questions, then yeah you should sell your Bitcoin.  This is not a Get Rich Quick scheme, and there are certainly riskier gambles you can make with your money if that is your goal (Look into Oil Futures).  Buying Bitcoin is for those that want to either diversify their portfolio (Bitcoin is an EXCELLENT hedge), or if you truly understand how big of a deal this market is becoming.
P.S. The argument "I can't spend Bitcoin anywhere" is outdated and incorrect too.  Most online stores accept it through gift cards, and you can directly convert it into Fiat whenever you want.
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:43:24
Bitcoin's never going to be as private as Monero or even DASH, and I don't think Litecoin will be either.
However I do think there could be some effort put into making it so over time the ledger makes it harder and harder to search old transactions, and it's almost impossible to follow transaction strings between more than a few accounts.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:56:56
How are these any harder to hack than an encrypted laptop that is turned off and left in a closet?

No state or individual is issuing Bitcoin.  Thus again - No, it would impede on state's rights for the federal government to try and ban it.
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:17:29
You likely won't see it.  Notice that I said a capitulation and surge from $1800.  Thus I am saying it would likely happen in under 2 hours - you would likely miss it happening before it has already bounced back above $2,500.  Most who see it will buy like crazy.
This could happen - there is still a notable amount of stupid still in this market that might need just one more game of Chicken to be rid of.

Tether doesn't seem bad to me.  They have been audited (it showed nothing is wrong), and the spotlight is REALLY on them - they would be insane to ruin a good thing.  
Furthermore I don't see Mt Gox sales as a mid-term issue.  The idiot selling them will for sure crash the price a bit, but that's it.  I think the buying power around 6K is WAY too strong for it to get much below it.

Ehhh you can always estimate within a reasonable margin in my experience.  So you seem informed, let me ask you:
If we had (effectively) 2.1MB blocks in November.... Would there have been $2 fees instead of $20?  Or less?
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:17:41
So $0.11 fees instead of $20.00.....  That's quite the improvement, and would likely mean the next rush wouldn't get nearly as high as before.
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:40:22
A few things:
1) Their value IS going up.  Thus it is human nature to use them as a store of value similar to stocks, and why is that bad?  There's no problems with using them as BOTH currency AND stocks.
2) Where do you live?   In Africa for example, Bitcoin IS already used as a currency.  Period.  
3) You are aware that people on Wall Street trade fiat currencies like stocks as well... Right?  There are plenty of speculators trading GBP for USD and Euros the same way people trade stocks.  So in reality your question is fundamentally flawed (no offense!).
Also please understand that a lot of people "HODL'ing" Bitcoin are doing so because they understand just how rare they are....
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:33:14
This was a pretty strong bounce though (FINALLY), and that does show that there are a lot of people who are ready to start "selling their house to buy cheap Bitcoin."
Imo we will either have another capitulation all the way down to $1800 with a surge back up, or we will do one more flash crash to 3500 that is instantly and powerfully rejected.  I don't really see much of an in-between.
Either everyone who will sell, has sold - or we need another mega fall to get out the junk.
@_date: 2018-11-16 16:39:45
Exactly.  Mining is designed to either grow or constrict with the Value of the Network.... Not the other way around.  People really need to stfu about "cost to mine."

Oh good lord give me a break buddy.  I am not saying anyone should blindly "HODL," and furthermore the only "HODLer's" out there are those that own Bitcoin - that includes anyone who bought one 5 seconds ago.

Yeah I recently dipped my toes into the Bcash sub, and it seriously seemed like 1/4th of the posts were novices asking "Why will Bcash go up so I can sell?"
I can't help but feel bad for so many people who's first foray into crypto was being swindled into buying "Bitcoin Cash" for $4000 or .25 BTC in December.  They didn't know any better, and they seriously thought they were buying a discount version of Bitcoin...

Do some actual research.  Gold (like everything buyable on Earth) has had some degree of manipulation from time to time, but the major reason Gold's value has been flat for so long is that it has no use.
If you want to save money you can  store wealth in the S&amp;P 500, Land, or more importantly for this sub - BITCOIN.  Gold has no real use anymore dude!  It's incredibly hard to sell.  It just sits in a safe wasting your money.

Some of them are though, and in the past none of the poor young people were involved.  NONE.  
I am actually surprised at how many of you don't understand that if Millennials got a hold of even 33% of the Bitcoins, that's SUBSTANTIALLY more than  the younger generation normally would.  Oh and here is this:
Most of the Bitcoins owned in America are under the age of 34, and less than 1% are Baby Boomers.  That IS incredible.
@_date: 2019-01-08 04:56:22
I worry about this type of stuff.  Don't doubt that this would serve 3 purposes for Russia:
1) Allow them to move towards a world currency untethered to the USD.  Maybe they finally accept they will never get widespread adoption of the rubble lol.
2) If they can associate "Russia with Bitcoin", then they could maybe get some of the dumber lawmakers in the west to see it as a threat to national security.  The US (despite what some say) is leading the way in blockchain companies, and getting the US to shoot itself in the foot in an emerging asset class would pay many dividends...
3) They could of course ban forms of Bitcoin transactions in their country that aren't under surveillance.  There could be state sponsored LN's that a state-sponsored app connects to.  Although I think this would eventually backfire on them...

I never said it was probable we would get 2MB blocks this year, but most developers seem to think an increase to 2MB wouldn't make it any harder for most people to run a node (I don't really want it bigger than 2MB due to storage size either).

Well I mined Litecoin, and then Darkcoin in 2014.  I seem to remember Bitcoin being worth ~$400-$800 back then.
I used an exchange called "BTC-E", and it actually worked quite well for exchanging coins.  Although I believe it doesn't exist anymore (and I think it was based in Belarus lol).
I have to say though: Don't listen to anyone telling you "you were bound to lose some money from Mt. Gox back then."  I was just getting into the space during the Mt. Gox fiasco, and it was OBVIOUS something was wrong with that exchange MONTHS before the real trouble started.   
Don't get me wrong, I feel bad for people that lost money - but I never kept more than 1% of my holdings on exchanges.  The wallets were always clearly the better way to store your money.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:38:34
Man this is getting desperate - Even if Bcash technically has more nodes than lightning, it doesn't seem like it's magnitudes more (and they should never be close). 
You would think this would scare Bcash puppets into selling, but the truth is that Bcash's longterm weakness is also their short term strength:  Less users = less buyers AND less sellers.  I no longer think Bcash will die before the next bull run, I think Bcash will continue to trade sideways and then just not gain much during the next run.  It will be slowly forgotten.

I still think there will be at least one interest rate increase this year, probably another .25%.  However it will of course depend on how much the stock market booms this year.
If the S&amp;P (for example) hits 3000-3500 points by the end of the year, it wouldn't be crazy for Powell to abruptly raise the rates all the way to 4% and dare people to complain.  He would be arguing from a position of strength that "The US Economy has never been stronger, sell if you want to."

Wealth distribution is definitely a concern, but people quoting these numbers have no clue what they are talking about.
Think about this:  If the price of a PS4 (due to high demand) has its price increased from $400 to $500.... and I buy it - does that mean I took an extra $100 from the "poorest 40%"?   NO!   
A lot of the "wealth" at the top is meaningless objects that we arbitrarily assigned value to - it wasn't taken from anyone.  Life expectancy, daily food, and infant survivability are all rising in ALL regions across the board.  We are all getting richer together - straight up.

It could certainly be a *component* of the next bull run, but it won't do it all by itself.  There have been NUMEROUS fantastic developments in 2018, and it changed nothing.  What we need right now is the last of the week hands and garbage projects shaken out.
What would be awesome is if we could either get another capitulation or just a re-test of $3000 before the great news starts rolling in.  If Bitcoin bounced off $3K again and hit $5K.... and then a week later Bakkt launched it would be very Bullish.  Hmmm, that would probably happen right around when the British pound collapses too...

@_date: 2019-01-29 01:53:26
They could try that I guess, wouldn't pan out though for any prolonged period of time.  People would know what is going on, and eventually supply would meet demand.... eventually the price would go up way faster than they could print.
Also just to put things in perspective - The US government (now) doesn't even have enough printing equipment to inflate the USD fast enough physically, and the Fed wouldn't allow any digital inflation without some pretty crazy developments leading up to it (keep in mind the Fed is 1000's of banks with central ones that vote on decisions).  This isn't something that would happen overnight in America.
Now "shithole countries" are a different story.  Yeah, nothing would stop a country like Bolivia from trying this BS, but then again few people would sell Bitcoin for their BS fiat currency.  We're fine.
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:01:23
Yeah unfortunately it probably won't be till 2020 (hopefully) until LN becomes somewhat common on Bitcoin accepting websites.  But it will come.
Until then all I can advise is to pay \~5-10 Satoshi per byte for anything you need confirmed in 10-20 min, or simply use Litecoin or Dash if those are options (they sometimes are).  
**But most importantly I have to ask why you need things with** ***multiple*** **confirmations done so often?**  Anytime I have transactions.... ever.... I haven't needed the thing to confirm for at least a few hours (Confirmed before shipping anyways!).  What on Earth are you using Bitcoin for that needs to be instantly done NOW?

Not saying I am doubting you - But is there a statement, leak, or any piece of data from Coinbase that supports your claim?
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:27:13
1) Ok yes I could see that as a solution in say 5-10 years, but I am looking for a somewhat quantitative answer.  I know it's a big ask, so I understand if you specifically don't want to answer this, but:
If someone were to take a modern-ish super computer (~100 PETAFlops), how many of the total theoretical addresses could it generate per year?  
If it was even .1%, and they could store them in a database that flags when one of the addresses corresponds to one holding value, they could do A LOT of damage.  I am curious if anyone is readily aware of the numbers needed to compute the ACTUAL answer to this question...
3) I am not sure I entirely agree that there are "easier ways to kill Bitcoin" outside of what I mentioned.  
a) Governments can only spread so much FUD, and litigation is limited due to impinging on "States Rights."  Bitcoin will not be banned because of lobbyists or old-timers (imo).
b) Dumping Bitcoins into the market doesn't work.  We know because it keeps happening ALREADY, and Bitcoin keeps bouncing back.  I am actually surprised some people still think this could kill it.
I am talking long term, and long term there will be some BIG losers with lots of money.  So I am asking basically:  How much it would cost to buy enough mining hardware, how long people think it would take to effectively kill Bitcoin with non-stop 51% attacks where they burn stolen BTC, and how much in electricity it would cost over that time period?
Again I understand these are complex and semi-theoretical questions I am asking, but I am curious how much people around here have meditated on these potential issues...

Woo is one of the smartest Analyst I have payed attention to.   I hate to say it, but all indicators I use are seriously pointing to us going to $1,800... at least briefly.  
I don't want this to happen lol, but objectively I have to stop lying to myself.   We are 90% going sub $3,000, and 60% sub $2,000.   It's scary though because I think Bitcoin is in serious trouble if it can't keep weekly closing candles above $1,500.

If the bottom is not in, it will be in by the end of the year (most likely).   If I were you I would dollar-cost-average in over the course of the next 6 months.
Figure out how much money you are willing to invest (risk?), and then divide that by 26.... Invest that much once a week.
P.S.  If Bitcoin goes below $2000, consider just throwing in the rest of whatever you want to invest.  But REALLY be prepared to control your emotions and not touch your Bitcoin for a couple years at least.
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:45:37
Should be under $1000 imo, or better yet it should only apply as an income tax when you convert crypto to Fiat.  You already pay sales' tax anyways too.
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:04:20
I know it doesn't directly mean to make transactions confirm faster, but at the very least they are.  Maybe because non-segwit transactions are still technically most of the network (And so the miners accepting segwit accept lower TX because they have to).

In 20 years if things work out?  Yes it could.   
I am not interested in getting into a flame war over what's possible or not unless you are willing to base your "hilarious" counter-claims on actual numbers and extrapolation.  This is it's own conversation, and the numbers ARE there to suggest $10m BTC could happen.
I don't think you realize how small of a number 21m is...

I think that is a bit naive.  Who knows when another Bull Run will happen, but if it happened 2 months from now; and BTC got to ~ $50-100K by the end of 2018 - I can assure you fees would be stupid again.
Now what do I mean by "stupid"?  I mean any fee above $0.10 that takes more than 1 hour to confirm is dumb.  I also do not believe lightning will be completely ready (especially with 1MB blocks) for another year at least.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:17:28
Furthermore they never shut up about how Bitcoin is supposedly "Forcing people to use lightning networks."
It's like they don't understand that even if lightning networks work out, you will still be able to send on-chain transactions like you can now.  
Additionally if lightning doesn't work out due to some unforeseen reason (it is still just a potential solution in testing), there ARE other solutions that can be worked on.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:40:09
Excellent news, but I have to say it is a bit surprising for me personally.

@_date: 2018-03-25 03:32:26
That's not entirely true.  There have been spikes recently, and there will be again.   Do you really not see any utility in having a network that NEVER has fees above $0.10 in normal usage, and never above $1 under insane demand?
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:12:10
A limited meltdown of one important currency like the Euro, Yuan, or Pound (this one is looking likely lol) would definitely help Bitcoin a lot.  It would prove its usecase and show nobody's currency is completely safe.
But a meltdown of all markets would NOT be good for anyone lol.  Nobody should be *hoping* this happens.
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:48:46

Except now we at least know the majority of the price decline wasn't from new users selling, and that means the Bull Run should easily reignite once this fool is done with his Fire Sale.

It's funny to because nobody is going by SV or ABC until one of them wins.  People will be too nervous to buy unless they think theirs is the winner.
Thus I give this a week before both Craig and Wu start losing many of their supporting miners to BTC.  Then we will get into a situation where SV and ABC each have only 1-2% of the hashrate the BTC network has, and they will likely start to get 51% attached by people on the BTC chain.
Btrash dead before 2019...
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:23:34
I have friends that are still interested, but they say "I feel like I missed the boat, and it's risky!"
But they also said this a year ago lol.  I suspect nothing has changed lately for the average Joe compared to the wealthy:  The longer Bitcoin exists, the more people that will invest in it due to being surprised it hasn't died yet. 
More rich people, AND more non-rich are investing right now.  But there will always be the same skeptics... 
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:54:17
Exactly!   In general BTC will likely be between $5K and $20K by the end of the year, but that means it isn't an explosion year.  Oh, and it shouldn't be!  A 1 year cool off period is healthy while we wait for SOME of the governments to catch up lol.
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:12:10
I will never understand why people act like you need to sell your house to invest in "Crazy" bitcoin.  You can invest $20,000, $10,000, $5,000, or even just $100.
Your biggest regret would be if you didn't invest anything, not if you didn't invest enough.
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:28:51

Hmmm I think I will answer this question with two answers:
1) DASH is well funded, and (unlike Zcash and many other shitcoins) they actually use that funding well.  You are seeing DASH everywhere because they have money, and the open financial reports they are committed to provide force them to spend that money on gaining adoption.
2) DASH is not a "shitcoin" at all.  It has a very competent team with an old and proven track record.  They were the  coin by marketcap in 2014 (4 years ago), and they have consistently been in the top 15 since then.  They are here to stay because they are actually being adopted as CURRENCY in several 3rd world countries.
Now I know some people will call me a "DASH Shill", but I don't care.  Bitcoin is  (and should be), but DASH deserves just as much credit as the other "proven coins" like Ethereum/Litecoin.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:59:04
Hence the truth - no storage method is 100% safe.  The safest way to store your Bircoins is in MULTIPLE locations.
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:05:27
I understand that, but at the same time there's not too much they can do when Litecoin plans on adding some form of anonymity within a year.  And with upgrades to Litecoin, Bitcoin usually follows.
So it will be interesting to see how it plays out if coins already on their exchange get upgraded to "Dark coins."   They can probably see this coming though, and so I thus somewhat suspect they will add Monero/DASH anyways once they figure out how to do it legally.
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:32:54
I put what little money I had in college into buying 2 x 6850's, a 6870, a 7950, and a 7970.  I mined this coin called "Darkcoin" lol.

Sorry if you haven't.
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:04:21
I would agree if the goal is to get Bitcoin above $10,000 before the end of the year - but that's not really a necessary (or confirmed) target for 2019.
It can easily drop all the way down to $1,400 next month and still climb to $6,000 before the end of the year. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 23:39:11
Agreed - and that is why I think you are asking the wrong question in the OP.  Why are you asking people to convince you to invest **$100,000?**
If $100,000 is risky for you (and it would be INSANE for most people lol), then invest less.  Either way you likely believe in Bitcoin or you just don't, and if you do - invest *something.* :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:38:40
Yeah me too actually.  I think a lot of people around here underestimate just how much sustained interest there is in crypto right now.  We are in the bear trap right before the main "Mainstream Frenzy" period....
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:17:07
What you just described is actually the CURRENT system.  Every few years big new tech or financial assets come out that the poor or uneducated cannot afford or gain access to, and then they suffer.  
However Bitcoin IS different, and I will give you an Example:  The first iPhone was $600, not $0.50.  Imagine if the first iPhone launched for $5, and then every 6 months they doubled the price... That's what Bitcoin is.
The market Bitcoin created truly is transformative.  You didn't need to know some guy, or come from some family, or be at ANY place at the right time - you just needed to see the genius in the whitepaper, and HODL.  I see this as comparable to the industrial revolution, where for the first time the English Gentry had to put up with these "Lower Class" people attending their snooty luncheons because they made more money actually inventing and producing machines.  :)
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:57:06
Haha this is also true.  A good example is FDR - easily in the top 10 presidents.

@_date: 2018-03-13 00:52:49
Close to half think it is above 20K, and many of the other half say WAY below 20K.  In general I would say that means the community is (On average) aware that this year is not a 2016 or 2017 rocketship year.

I don't really want the Yellow Vest people associated with Bitcoin.

As long as you are careful, I would actually say certain forms of TA have worked for me *better* in the Bitcoin market than they have in other markets - you just have to be more opportunistic and careful.  But (in my experience) when there is a solid signal in Bitcoin TA - it is even more likely to be correct in Bitcoin than in Traditional Markets.
That is *my* experience.  Your childish complaints don't change profits I have made lol, and in fact I do always find it hilarious when noobs vote down bearish statements.  I am sure you would upvote me if I said something positive - get a life.  I don't want Bitcoin to go down, but it is what it is.
Last, I am not sure why you cannot comprehend percentages and chance... Maybe you are bad with numbers.  **I didn't say it will "go up or down", I said: it will** ***most likely*** **continue to trend down in the short term, and a total capitulation is looking more and more likely.**   Thus I am not saying nothing - I am saying you shouldn't be going "all in" quite yet... But do whatever you want kid.
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:57:34
Yeah, maybe an impeachment too.  I personally don't expect the dollar to go down though.
It's not because I think any form of fiat is great or anything, but the USD is the least stupid and most responsibly controlled fiat - so until someone starts debasing it (hopefully not some lefty in 2020), it's gonna do well.  
The US has made it through multiple impeachments before, and it was fine.  But a hard Brexit and the possible disintegration of the EU?   BAD BAD BAD

$15 to send $5,000 in under 24 hours **is** "almost free" when banks would usually charge $100-$500 and take **an entire week.**   If you could wait a few days, it would cost what I said - $1-$5.   I do not agree that my statement was inaccurate.  
It's all relative, and relatively speaking Bitcoin's fees were magnitudes less than what banks charge *in a worse case scenario*.  And it all happened without any middleman, and while there was a massive spam attack going on.

**Every** growable asset booms and busts lol - all of them.   But having a *degree* of risk does not equal gambling.  You are right that most people stay away from real estate, stocks, gold, and yes Bitcoin.  - **These people are stupid, not wise.**
These people live paycheck to paycheck, throw away money every month into apartment rent, and at best horde some cash that slowly loses value.    Many of my friends still tell me they are smart to not risk money in the stock market, but I wouldn't call missing out on 10 years of gains "smart."  **It's stupid.**   
Most people don't invest any money wisely.  These people will *also* miss out on Bitcoin.  **Missing out on the enormous gains Bitcoin has seen is by no definition "wise" or "smart" - it's** ***ignorant.***

Personally, I would recommend at least $100.  But it really doesn't matter...

He is a smart Engineer too.  For people like him, I think the thing really holding him back is procrastination.  He wouldn't invest in anything without reading the whitepaper and fully understanding it first.  Thus he keeps putting off when he will take the time get into this market because he thinks he can wait.... Without realizing the people that made the most money are the ones that DIDN'T procrastinate and bought in as soon as possible.  Doesn't mean people shouldn't buy in 1 or 10 years from now, but the longer they wait the more it is more about storing value than making money.
On the other hand my stupid friend has made money because he just bought into the market blindly...

Just like they said 2018 would be "the year of altcoins."
But what these idiots don't realize is that 2017 was the year of forks and altcoins lol.  Bitcoin went to 20K, but it was only a 20x increase.  Meanwhile Ethereum went up by 100x!!!!
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:58:06
Yeah and they were then punished with a 2 year bear market that killed off 100's of shitcoins.
However it's been half a **decade** since 2013, and 2017 hit even more insane numbers in the altcoin market than before.  Many of these altcoins are outright scams or at best have no real world usecase.  Thus they need to be punished harder - **The market hasn't matured enough yet.**
Now I differ from Tone/Tyler where it comes to statements like "Bitcoin needs to hit 90% market capitalization again" - I don't think that's true (or even possible anymore).   The market has changed, and now there are thousands of coins.  Furthermore most projects can't really "die" per say, they just become irreverent and stop increasing in price.
However I will say that I mostly agree with Tyler/Tone's *sentiment.*  I do think Bitcoin needs to get back to 65-75% market cap of **top 100 coins** (who cares about anything below 100?!).  Until I see that.... Or I see Bitcoin hit $8,000.... I don't think this bear market is over.

Aaaaaand thank you!   Interesting book to read (Although some of it you will need a math or engineering background to understand haha).  
For those interested, the theory in that cheap looking link starts being discussed on the bottom of page 157.  He actually goes on to theorize that the best computers we will get for cracking keys in the next 100 or so years are biological-based computers (They are already being tested in labs actually), but these still could only really crack 128-bit keys and they would take up entire small oceans of space.  
The only thing that concerns me is that when the book went through the history of number factoring it showed:  The only thing humans can consistently predict about the future of brute-force factoring is that we ALWAYS underestimate our abilities to come up with new ways to factor numbers quickly in the future.  But at the very least you could argue that even if someone finds a way to brute force a bitcoin address 1000 years from now, we do not yet have the insight to know how they will do it!
Again  thanks!  This is the type of depth I am looking for in answers.  Care to answer the other ones with that much insight? :P

The funny thing is that it really seems like (whether he would admit it or not), CSW has realized Bcash is nothing but a Bitmain Coin backed by Ver.  It's entirely centralized, and Bitmain only supports it to increase profits.
Hence why I actually do give it a 50/50 chance CSW is willing to burn his whole house down if it means stopping the Bitmain-controlled chain.  This isn't over - the hashwars will continue.

I have a friend who is actually a very successful programmer as well, and he *also* thinks that Bitcoin is BS.... or at least he used to before he found out how much I believe it has potential.
You have to understand how silly Bitcoin sounds most of the time on the surface level - especially when most people talking about it are saying the dumbest things.  It's rare you have someone like Andreas or Jimmy Song speaking in an incredibly deep and articulate way.  Most of the time it's just idiots yelling "Bitcoin gonna make you rich!"

It's new, and no one plays Fast And Loose with money.  Money demands conservative actions.  You can't fuck around with wealth.
Again, don't worry - LN will *likely* become standard in the next few years.  But it just takes time.  Think of how long it took us to go from gold - USD - banker wars - Federal Reserve with backed money.  It was like **150 years of Americans not being sure what money was safe!**
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:53:41
Biggest?  No, lol.
But it is definitely a good development.  Finally there will be Bitcoin logo's in major stores that are hard to avoid.  One of the first steps to migrating Bitcoin from "niche" to "early adoption" is ensuring it is easily found and seen in common life.  This is *one* part of that first step...

This post is noob 2013-era BS.  It would have been talked about back then, but the novelty of a simple bloody wallet isn't special anymore lol.
The market isn't done shaking out the stupid, and it probably won't be till we wick down to $1500 briefly (hopefully briefly).  The only situation that might cement the bottom above $2,500 (imo) is if these three things happen in the same month:
1) A hard brexit that makes the British Pound collapse... in conjunction with Bakkt actually going well.
2) The US Shutdown almost threatens the value of the USD due to dragging on too long.
3) Bakkt and an ETF actually get approved - making it easy for noobs to buy in.
\^Now these things might happen, but it's unlikely even 2 of them will.  This is the type of immense news it takes to **unnaturally** turn around a Bear market before it is truly done.

Clickbait title, but I don't disagree with his statements.  
I don't think Bitcoin needs anonymity to the degree of Monero, or even DASH - but it DOES need to be better.  At the very least it needs to get to the point that transactions become harder and harder to track as they get older, and additionally people can avoid being followed by the NSA as long as they switch accounts a couple times a year.

Yeah I still think we are going to sub-$2000 briefly... but idk I do get the feeling we might get a V-bottom and start spiking back up sooner than expected as well.
**Either way it finally feels like the buzz around Bitcoin is changing.  People seem to be talking about its** ***actual merits*** **more often than it just being the newest "get rich quick scheme."**

It was just a turn of a phrase, don't take it seriously.  Personally I don't think Bitcoin will get above $10,000,000, but then again you do have to remember that if the USD was ended then one BTC could easily equal a Trillion $ since it's now worthless lol.
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:30:58
Oh come on man, yes it would; or at the very least you are in the minority for stating it wouldn't have had an effect.  But what's really funny is you continuing to say the word "Obsession."  Apparently to you anyone who asks a question is "Obsessed."  That's pretty pathetic.

Bitcoin Core wallet for Desktop is honestly what I recommend most of the time.  It's incredibly secure and the standard.
For mobile there is another Developer-made wallet called Bitcoin Wallet for "legacy" transactions, and then also the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet too for segwit and lightning transactions.
@_date: 2019-01-15 18:26:24
We are using educated guesses at best, but most metrics I use indeed point to us not peaking again until 2022.  However I new ATH of like $25,000 next year isn't out of the cards.  I expect this next run up to be very slow until the last few months.
I am still completely unsure too of how high we are likely to go in the next peak.  I am feeling just under $150K or maybe $230K, but I always seem to underestimate.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:22:21
That's the thing.  There have been suggestions (And real examples) of crypto mining forcing companies and governments to accelerate their renewable energy initiatives.
So perhaps PoW could actually force BETTER environmental outcomes on the world.  It truly is creating a new class of investors willing to pay big money for cheaper energy.  
Although I do worry longterm.  A $1,000,000 Bitcoin would make mining 100x more profitable than it is now lol!

Which is completely reasonable.
It takes time, effort, and intelligence to understand some of the in-depth parts of cryptocurrencies.  So if I was a busy politician that didn't have time to read into this, I would just back up and let the experts handle it for now.
But I would also try to regulate any company that offers an ICO.  That's enforceable, and it's necessary.

Why?  I am here to discuss slight increases and if they could potentially reduce fees by magnitudes from small increases.  
Off-chain solutions are the future either way.  But I suspect a 1.5MB block increase would be just enough to tide the chain over until lightning is ready in a year.

To quote Andreas "I don't remember the first time I heard of Bitcoin, but I do remember the second.  We all remember the second time most, because the first time you hear about it... It always sounds too good to be true!"
I actually heard of it late 2012, but the wallet took so long to sync that I assumed it was broken or something.  Haha then I got into in a big way mid-2013, and I am glad I did!
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:56:53
Nope, but I like informed discussions where SOME people bring supporting arguments to their predictions.  Either way I do agree that no matter what NO ONE can predict this market exactly.  For example I didn't think BTC would crash to $180 again, but I also thought BTC would hit $5K in 2017 at the HIGHEST.
@_date: 2019-01-28 01:57:47
It's probably gonna have at least one more leg down (even if brief), but yeah there's a chance this could be the "stable year" so many have spoken of before.
The year Bitcoin proves it can withstand the worst drop in history while also being less volatile than other markets.  It would remove yet another argument the nay-sayers love repeating...

@_date: 2018-03-15 00:50:52
Honestly can you blame them for supporting Bcash?  It (unfortunately) has a lot of value, and so I would argue it would be unfair if they didn't give people access to their Bcash funds.  Furthermore I don't think it would be fair for them to remove it until it has already become irreverent or mired in scandal.  That would send a bad president for future (possibly not stupid) hardforks of other coins...

Good for you kid.    
The point of my comment wasn't to share some "magic" I think I have, I am merely sharing my work because I am curious what other informed/knowledgeable people think.   If you don't like what I am saying, feel free to ignore it.  Or better yet - make an informed comment to add to the conversation.
But don't act like TA is all about "who is following who", or that a bearish comment is "anti-bitcoin".   Just because I am bearish, doesn't mean I want to be right lol.

And you are?    What would you  say is intelligent about those protests?

@_date: 2019-01-24 19:48:52
"Robustness" is a good word to use.  Indeed I am also surprised at how absolutely unshaken Bitcoin is by all the BS over the past 5 years.   In fact **I remember thinking in 2014-2015 that Bitcoin would likely be fine, but that there was still a 40% chance it will fail.  But in this bear market I have very little doubt Bitcoin will be fine over the next few years - would you agree?**
I for sure thought something dumb would *almost* destroy Bitcoin - Bitmain takeover, 51% attack, Western Governments banning, some crippling bug, etc.  Seems like any attempt to attack Bitcoin is immediately counter-attacked by an almost Immune System that evolves due to Bitcoin's incentive structures.
@_date: 2019-01-20 04:39:56
Yeah that's not Bitcoin's fault at all.  Most exchanges do planned "batched" transactions every 5-20 minutes.  So there is an expected delay.
Heck I have had exchanges take 1 hour to send DASH, and yet I always send it INSTANTLY with zero fees when it's me sending it.  **It's the exchange's fault.**
@_date: 2019-01-16 18:06:08
Conventional wisdom actually said Bitcoin was way overpriced at $20K, so the analogy is reversed.
Right now would *actually* be like the start of the Big Short if they were **buying Bitcoin at these bottom-ish prices.**  Most in the mainstream are saying not to buy Bitcoin, and thus they would be "doing it again" if they were buying BTC.

Because the exchange is stupid.  You're not gonna get a better answer than that - it's the truth.   I just used LN to *instantly* get some gift cards.  Also:
1) Keep in mind that A LOT of the money exchanges make is from people messing around with shitcoins.  Thus many exchanges try to make Bitcoin look slower on purpose.   **I mean really think about it - if they wanted Bitcoin to be fast, they would use Segwit and LN.  If they aren't, they are dumb or lazy.** 
2) You never answered my question lol - why did you NEED Bitcoin to confirm so quickly?  Whenever I use on-chain bitcoin I just pay the near-zero fee and forget about it.  It will get there eventually.
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:47:29
Higher than it started in 2019, but probably not by much.  I think this year will end overall positive ($4000-$7000), but not blow anyone's socks off.... except there will be articles stating: "If you bought Bitcoin in February, you would have tripled your investment by now."  Next year is $20,000-$30,000.  Just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:40:51
Haha the whole sentiment in the article makes immediate sense when you read "I lost 80% of my holdings when I panic sold between $20K and $10K."
He has no idea how long Bitcoin has been around, and how much worse previous crashes were.  He also makes no reference to anything having to do with the technology and its long term viability.
Just a sore loser telling himself he is smart for panic selling...
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:20:52
If I am being completely objective in my analysis, I could see Bitcoin crash to around $5-7K.  That's what we should expect with these caveats:
-If it stops above $7,000, that means we are likely only looking at a few months of a BullVBear market before the trend continues up.
-If it stops above $5000, then this was a typical large crypto crash - but not the worst one.  It will likely be a very slow climb before any big moves.  Likely end-of-2018 is when things would show real improvements.
-It it goes BELOW $4,000.... Well this will be comparable to the 2013 crash.  We would all likely want to just ignore the market for 2-4 years as it consolidates.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:14:59
You want to buy before the shift happens.  What you need to establish is if you truly believe this technology is revolutionary (it is), and if you think so you should buy.
But personally I somewhat disagree with your assessment of how people currently regard Bitcoin.  More and more people are finally talking about crypto with a modecom of understanding.   Most people seem to be positive about it, even if it is just slightly more than the amount of people that are negative.  
I smell change in the air...
@_date: 2019-01-18 00:55:05
If you are seriously concerned due diligence is required, you need to officially consult professionals.
But, I would say that you have done more then enough.  You have the name and you (I assume) will log the transaction.    
Long term though money laundering will likely become an outdated concept.
@_date: 2018-11-09 20:43:49
Yes, but it wouldn't necessarily crash anything or even prevent bubbles in other markets from happening.
For example houses and land will always have many factors that add to their land's value (and therefore the overall housing market's value), and there will always be people that come up with reasons to invest more in the housing market and create a new bubble cycle.
However Bitcoin (if wildly successful long term) could make the bubbles in other markets much more grounded.
@_date: 2019-01-31 17:25:53
That's not true at all. % gains are % gains.
If you invest $100, it may be worth $10,000 some day.  No you won't be rich for life, but it's still a very good investment.  In fact if I were in a poorer country I would be more likely to put a decent amount of my money into bitcoin.  You never know what lesser governments may do to their fiat...
@_date: 2019-01-16 18:02:34
No it doesn't lol, and I don't think there is almost any chance BTC will get that high in the next bullrun.
However $80K-$500K by 2025 is quite possible.
@_date: 2019-01-24 17:23:05
To gain adoption through SoV first.   Once a significant amount of people **hold** Bitcoin for longterm wealth, store owners will want to accept it.
Worrying about this before Bitcoin succeeds in its *first most important* usecase is stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-12 04:17:29
I averaged it out (Based on assigning the average to each range, and $25K to those that said 20K+).  Generally I think Bitcoin will be a slight bear market till later this year, and then a slight Bull market will ignite.   That would place it somewhere around 12K-25K by the end of the year...
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:25:49
That's kinda what I am asking here too.
@_date: 2019-01-16 06:14:35
I mean who said anything about worrying?  My particular post (and Woo's) was regarding where the market is going - you can use this knowledge to make some money.  Nobody is saying this means "Bitcoin is dead."
However I will say that it is a tad concerning that so many seem to not understand that this is going to be by far the worst Bear Market in BTC's history.   It is weird how mad people around here get when some of us mention how bad things are about to get.... I mean are you ready to go 3 years with Bitcoin below $5,000?   That might happen....
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:46:03
Before Bitcoin can be mainstream, we need:
1) Matured Lightning and additional on-chain scaling innovations (like Schnorr).  You don't want a $100,000 BTC before we properly support all of those transactions cheaply.
2) Proper and intuitive wallets that combine Segwit, Schnorr, and lighting together for excellent privacy and transaction speed.  In otherwords we need a "Venmo Challenger."
3) A black swan event that reminds everyone why Bitcoin is needed.... Even in "first world" countries.  It could be the collapse of the Pound, Yuan, or even some type of Patreon replacement that uses Bitcoin so free speech and be supported.
@_date: 2019-01-25 01:31:50
Sounds about right, but be careful using reason to explain your opinion.  Some people around here freak out if you say anything remotely bearish, I think they have self esteem issues because of how bad they are with numbers...
@_date: 2019-01-18 00:58:40
The entire point of Bitcoin is to be neither.  It makes it so no person controls money, and therefore cannot do "evil."  
That's the point.

The sad thing is I can see the comments from investors now: "When your cab driver says to buy something, that's when you need to sell!"

@_date: 2019-01-16 18:44:22
In 10+?  Yes maybe a $1M Bitcoin... But 2025 is 6 years from now.
However I am inclined to think a few things here:
1. This should be the longest bear market in Bitcoin history, possibly not ending till mid-2020.
2. The next run-up will probably start 2020, but it might be later; and it will probably also be slower than usual.
3. I just do not see the next Bullrun doing more than \~10x the previous ATH ($200K peak).
4. After the next peak, the resulting correction's size will highly depend on how many dumb projects exist.  If the market has finally grown a brain and stopped supporting junk like Btrash and Iota (for example), then I could see a less severe bear market next time.   However if we see the same level of stupid (except more) again... idk I could see a crash all the way down to $10,000 from $200,000.  **Hopefully the market will be smarter this time...**
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:21:40
Yeah in general I am sick of people even saying "Bitcoin topped at $20,000!"
No it didn't lol - there was like one trade at \~$19,800 (not 20K!), and the price stayed there for 5 min if I remember correctly.  In Technical Analysis you would call that day's candle an absolutely insane "Shooting Star".  It wicked up crazy fast to the (maybe literally) *one* sucker who bought at 30% higher than everyone else, and then it rocketed right back to Earth at \~$13-$15K.
**Bitcoin really topped at $15K in 2017, and in fact it really topped at $1,000 in 2013 (not $1,200 lol).**   
**The 2018/19 bottom will probably look similar too:  People will say it crashed to idk $1,800, but if it hits that low it will be for 5 min.  The real crash is $15K-$3K, not $20K-$1.8K.**

I agree that very soon we need to consider implementing regulations that aim to make sure growth is sustainable.... but honestly I wonder if this can even happen before we unlock extremely long life.
Until we get to a point where the average person lives (well) to the age of 120 Years, why would anyone care about the future?
But until then here is what we know - In western countries the % of forest is **growing,** not shrinking.  In poor countries the environment is being destroyed.  Thus the only *real* conclusion we can make *based on facts* is that the richer a country becomes, the more green it will be come.   What we also know is that the US is paving the way with Green energy research, *not China or most of Europe!*   If you want to save the Earth, you should want decent regulations to protect it; but you should also want to NEVER impede economic progress or you risk setting back research and the march of science - and that IS what will save Earth 20 years from now.

"Get off" is indeed the term I would use.  It's almost never based on facts or reason - some people just want to hate the most powerful country.
And yeah a lot of people want to hate the US because of Trump, but you know who also hates Trump?  **Most Americans lol.**  Hmm let's also see approval ratings in other countries:
\-Macron = 27%
\-May = 29%
\-Trudeau = 35% (Lower than Trump despite US media practically worshiping him)
\-Abe = 43% (basically tied with Trump except for right now)
\-Merkel = 56% (Hey one isn't completely hated! :D )
The best we can find is someone where more-or-less she is still not approved of by half her country, and she is still probably the best president their country has had in decades (Merkel).  So America's worse president in history is still better regarded than a lot of the other clowns out there right now.
**What really bothers me though is how many people chant that the US should leave everyone alone.   I don't think these people get how international affairs turn out when** ***other*** **countries mess with things.  Just look at Syria...**

Why isn't it worth buying at $100K?  Are you another one of those people that doesn't realize how excellent of a store of value Bitcoin is?
That's what I was saying with "Mental Wall" too.  I think the price can easily get to $30K-$120K during another Bull Run within a year or 2, but it will take a financial crisis for people to wake up and realize that people holding Bitcoin are the only ones who didn't have their savings wiped out.  Then there will be a run for the doors as money floods in -&gt; And there aren't enough Bitcoins for every Millionaire in JUST America to buy 1.
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:24:39
It actually depends on what you mean by "fastest".  For instance Bcash isn't any faster than Bitcoin (it's actually a little slower), but its network can handle more at once due to the much larger blocks.
Litecoin and DASH are known for speed, and there are dozens of others.  Oh, and please no one get mad at me for mentioning other coins.  This part of the conversation should probably be in the r/Cryptocurrency sub, but I figured I would answer it here before it gets filled by shills from another 100 altcoins lol.

Do you know what the funny thing is?  This article is half right!
Look I agree with most around here that Bitcoin is a permanent financial asset, and I in fact think Bitcoin will settle on $50,000-$1,000,000 per coin.   BUT, blockchain IS overhyped.  The only real use case for blockchain is censorship resistance, rapid auditing of massive data, and fair distribution.  If you don't need any of those things, you don't need blockchain lol.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:29:03
Bcash removal should come first.  Don't worry Stellar, Dash, Monero, and others will be added soon enough.

Well now we are getting into the hardest part of talking about Bitcoin: what is it's true value?   I have see experts say "$100", and recently I have seen a few say "$10,000,000."  My opinion is that IT COULD get to $10m, but that might be in 2030 or something.  However there are numbers out there that support it getting that high:
1) There are 15 MILLION millionaires in America.  If each of them wanted a Bitcoin right now, there wouldn't be that many for sale.  There are way more than that world wide. 
2) It only takes 1 Trillion Dollars in trading to move the market up to 20 Trillion...

The entire point of decentralized money is that one can finally store wealth somewhere safe that no one can take it.  That is the **only** usecase that is truly revolutionary.   Everything else is secondary, or even tertiary.
**Plenty of currencies have existed for** ***decades*** **that can be sent quickly and easily between peers.  That is not what Bitcoin was created for.**  Bitcoin is P2P Digital Currency, not an "Instant Payment Processor."
Oh, and even during the worst TX fee months Bitcoin allowed people to send thousands of dollars almost free *as long as you can wait a day*.  Even in December of 2017 Bitcoin was only expensive if you needed to send money in under an hour, and why would you use bitcoin for that?!

I said $15 to send $5000 in 1 day across the world is cheaper (and quicker) than **what banks charge.**  Also if you scroll up, you will see that I indeed advocate using credit cards for quick payments - that's what credit cards (not Bitcoin) are for.
**Bitcoin is for storing unconfiscatable wealth, and immutably moving it internationally much easier than Gold** (or even banks).  That is the bitcoin revolution, not some techno-BS version of credit cards that *already exist.*  Credit cards work just fine for your stupid cup of coffee lol.

@_date: 2018-03-25 03:29:06
But do you really not see the thought experiment I am doing here?
What if hypothetically 1.25MB blocks lowered fees by 100x on average over the next year, and then also made it easier to use second layers.  I run multiple nodes, and I can assure you that I do not think a change to 1.25MB would have ANY effect on who could run a node.  There would be NO INCREASE in centralization.

The funny thing is that it would be AMAZING if Bitcoin hit 12K by Q4 2018.  Every analyst in this market keeps saying that 12K is the barrier Bitcoin keeps failing to pass in order to stop the Bear market, and it seems like they are right lol.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:34:51
Bitcoin will succeed, because it ALREADY HAS. That is what people like this need to understand.
If they wanted to kill it, they should have done it in 2014 when the bear market almost killed it without them.  But now that it is holding above $5000, and now that several US states and EU countries have declared they will be supporting it - it's too late.  If France tries to ban it, it won't be allowed to because Germany and Switzerland would block it.  If the Feds try to ban it, Wyoming will say it impedes on their state's rights.
It's already too late to kill Bitcoin, and it's almost too late to slow it down.  Bankers let their ego's blind them to emerging tech, and I think they will continue to.  Once Bitcoin hits $100,000 - $500,000, it will be too big to fail.

**You need to define what a "bull run" is**.  It's not clear a bull run is underway until you are *well* into it.  Some (stupid) people say the "Great Crypto Winter of 2014-2015" was 1-1.5 years, but I would argue it was closer to 2+ years.  
It wasn't entirely clear things were good until early 2016 at the earliest, and there was still a massive drop at the very beginning of 2017.
The bull market will likely be starting when we see a $7,000 Bitcoin, and definitely when we see a $10,000 Bitcoin.  But don't expect that for another 6 months at the earliest, and possibly not till early 2020.  You also need to look for garbage like Ethereum and Btrash dying to signal the market is growing a brain.
Although I would say the worst case is a bull run by the next halving - mid 2020.

I am aware of that, and so I am wondering if anyone has gone back in time and done the math:  Segwit (1.4MB) + 1.5MB blocks = effectively a 2.1MB block.  
So if we effectively had 2.1MB blocks in November, would the fees have been 1/10th of what they were?

Yet the Standard of Living is rising in ALL countries globally every year (minus the countries killing themselves).
In fact 95% of the world in the 1890's lived in what (today) we classify as "extreme poverty."  Wealth distribution was much "better" back then.  **So if anything there is a correlation that** ***the more*** **wealth becomes unequal, the greater the median standard of living is.**  So I guess we should hope for MORE wealth inequality?

In your opinion is Bitcoin ahead or behind where you thought it would be in 2014?  (Don't know if you were involved back then)
For me the price is higher than I expected, and it has suffered WAY less major attacks than I also thought.... but adoption is still not quite where I thought it might be in a few years.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:17:03
DASH is the fastest traditional crypto I have used (Again, I am not a shill - just my experience).
If you use the InstantSend option in DASH, it randomly selects 10 masternodes (Out of ~4000 total at time of this posting) for an instant 10 confirmations.  I think it costs about a dollar (most DASH transactions cost less than a cent and take minutes).  However it is worth noting that a $1 instant send actually buys you more security than a 6-confirmation wait period with Bitcoin (that takes ~1 hour).
Litecoin is also pretty good though, I just haven't used it for a while; and I know Pascal is aiming to basically do the same thing DASH does without the requirement of Masternodes.
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:51:13
Again people - I never said it should be done willy nilly, but I don't mind entertaining the idea of "What small increase could bring enough short term stability, and also allow more powerful off-chain programs?"

Buddy we are in the middle of a descending triangle right now (a bad one too).  Therefor this increase in volume is incredibly likely to actually be a sign of an impending breakdown - this could be people in the know who care getting out before the next drop.
Now there is of course a 20% chance this could break upwards within a week..... but that is highly unlikely imo.   It would take a series of truly gamechanging developments in the space.

Bitcoin crashed after 2013 for 2.5 years STRAIGHT, and it was an 85% crash!   So as long as Bitcoin stays above 6K, this last Bullrun recovered from its resulting crash better than previous surges.  But to answer your question directly: This will continue to be a Bear Market as long as people are unsure of how regulations will go!  The second it becomes clear that the US/EU will adopt mostly positive regulations, everyone will jump in.

And could it become the default payment option?   One weakness I am tired of is the fact that you have to check a box in order to make a Segwit address, or to conduct a private send with DASH.  I wish both just made it the default (I am aware that private send has some limitations).  I think the box should be for "use legacy address, may cost more." 
So would schnorr be utilized without checking a box? (and will Bech32 eventually as well?) 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:01:05
Well it's undoubtedly unavoidable that some of the shitheads in wallstreet will profit a ton off of this, but I would say it's a short term necessary evil.  After all they are helping make us rich, and not all of them are bad.
Long term mass adoption of Bitcoin (And a few other alts) would basically make it impossible for Banks and fraudulent companies to continue to pull the  BS they have been pulling for centuries.  After all, we can all see the ledger ;).
So to be more specific - my only true worry is that the worst and smartest of the "bad guys" buy up so much of the supply that they can effectively control the market and euthanize it.

@_date: 2018-02-01 22:34:23
Yeah honestly that is what is starting to bother me the most.  It reminds of mid-2017 when AMD stocks failed to bounce as high as they should have.  AMD was fully thriving company again, but most lemmings didn't wake up to this fact until some people shorted the stock a dozen times to make sure they could buy in cheap.
The same is happening with Bitcoin right now.  It has been almost nothing but good news for the past month, and yet right now it is incredibly clear that some billionaires are throwing their weight around to make it easier to acquire a ton of money before it is too late for them.
But I don't want the money laundering bankers to be able to buy in.  This is a very REAL chance for the average Joe's of the world to completely suck the wealth out of the useless speculators on Wallstreet.  Full stop we are looking at a chance for the newly Informed People of the internet age to decide on their own that we do not need these people taking our money anymore.

@_date: 2018-02-13 15:05:12
Well that's nice to consider, I am not so sure it would really help with anything.
Looking at the current ASIC prices it seems like a reduction in mining rewards would really only affect small-time miners.  It's already only profitable to mine Bitcoin for the most energy-efficient and well connected Mega Operations.  Reducing the reward would just further centralize the network.
Before any reward reduction happens, we really need someone like Samsung to make a FAR cheaper mining setup for the average joe (That they don't horde most of for themselves like Bitmain does).

If we (hopefully) bottom at $1,800 within a few months.... we should only hope for us rallying to $5,000-$7,000 by the end of the year.
However ending the year above $5,000 would be very bullish for 2020 and 2021 imo.  It would show big gains finally, and convince most to buy in for the next rally. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:13:27

@_date: 2018-02-13 05:39:46
I am unfamiliar with this "method".  Isn't the majority of the hashing network required for any hardfork to be successful?
To be honest I think 1) we need to lower the mining rewards, and 2) make it so more than just mega ASIC miners can efficiently mine on the network (Like with Ethereum).
Although TBH you could argue  may solve itself if someone like AMD or Nvidia specifically went out of their way to make a good and cheap mining card anyone could afford.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:36:11

A "bit" strong?
LOL the only time Bitcoin was ever looking questionable imo was back in 2014 and 2015 when it hit $180 after hitting $1200 2 years prior.  That was brutal, and it went on for TWO YEARS!  Furthermore, there was ZERO institutional backing behind crypto back then (So it really could have gone to zero).
But right now things are far from any sort of "Abyss."  Bitcoin sitting at $8000 is nothing but AMAZING news as long as it stays above $5000.  Furthermore there is now ZERO chance that it will actually go to zero.

@_date: 2018-03-25 06:39:40
Well by how you are talking, it's obvious you aren't one of these Great Developers lol.  
Look around - it's obvious slight increases in block sizes would actually have huge implications on fee reductions.  Furthermore a small increase isn't hard at all as long as it demonstratively is worked out as the perfect mount to build off of for layer 2 (And not a temporary solution that will need to happen again).  1.5, 2, 4, or whatever - I am curious about what people think would be the highest we would ever need to reduce fees a ton while also not going overboard in size increases that aren't needed when Lightning takes over.
This thread is just a place to discuss what a potential perfect balance would be between making sure on-chain fees never get insane, and never making blocks bigger than they need to be.

"You might wonder why I feel so strongly about this. Imagine all the people with all their savings in securities tied to fiat, pensions, college funds you name it. You think these people are just going to accept to buy into a system where their savings have become practically worthless."
They are going to have to eventually, or they will miss out.  Just like people have to fill out resumes using the internet now.  The march of progress cares not for what YOU want, it only marches forward.
Oh and for the third time: I never said this would happen over night, or that ALL fiat/traditional finance will become worthless (You keep putting these words in my mouth).  But yes I do believe cryptoassets will eventually become as big as the stock market, probably within 10 years (10 years IS slow organic growth lol).  I am not sure why you are becoming so angry about this prospect - this would be overall good for the world.  It is a long overdue check on centralized institutions, and has nothing to do with "Moon Lambos" (I think those cars are ugly and a complete waste of money btw).
P.S.  Those people with pensions and securities are already having their wealth stolen genius.  Entire cities in the richest country in history are going bankrupt, and have you seen the news?

"This would leave the same wealth gap we have now"
1) No it wouldn't.  You clearly have no idea how BIG the wealth gap is right now.
2) There will always be a wealth gap.  Get over it.  However with Bitcoin there is no way to directly control the market the way current Oligarchs do, and so it is without a doubt an upgrade to the existing system.

For the record though: I tried it again with the minimum fee 4 hours later and it didn't confirm for 18 hours (until I increased the fee to 20 cents).
Still a low fee, but don't expect it to confirm quickly every time you pay a "basically free" tx.  However I am guessing it would have still confirmed within a day.

The fact is you are being overly negative to the point of being unrealistic.   Could Bitcoin fall apart?  Yes, but it's WAY less likely that could happen now than before in previous crashes.  It would take something absolutely extraordinary for this crash to be anything more than a standard market correction.

And people bought Bitcoins at $10K too, don't forget that!  I didn't think Bitcoin would hit $10K till 2020!

@_date: 2018-02-12 18:13:58
100% agreed!
The transaction fee issue has already arguably been solved in altcoins like DASH anyways, and there are multiple promising upgrades Bitcoin can implement to alleviate the current too-successful Bitcoin.
But PoW mining seems like a very real longterm issue.  Perhaps advancements in alternative energy (like Solar and Fusion) will make this a non-issue, but I am skeptical.   I just can't help but think that eventually Bitcoin will need to move to an ASIC-resistant algorithm, but I don't know how that could happen with the stranglehold Mega-Miners have on the network....
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:58:25
Why?   Our generation has never been forgiven for anything.  On the contrary the younger generations have been constantly ridiculed by these old idiots who accused us of not knowing what we are talking about (When really they never have).
This is seriously the least-well researched thing I have read, and I used to grade papers at college.  This is insane.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:39:15

After all you are turning into a child so I might as well start being condescending if you are going to accuse everyone with more information than you "condescending."
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:40:32
Do these powerbrokers of the previous era realize they are simply aiding in their own destruction?
They think they can simply cash in on this industry by calling Bitcoin a "commodity" and saying things like "Blockchain is here to stay, but we are not sure about Bitcoin."
When you talk about "Blockchain" or allow people to buy Bitcoin "only as a commodity" they aren't mitigating the tide of change.  Endorsing Blockchain just makes people want to buy Bitcoin, and calling Bitcoin a "commodity" doesn't stop anyone from using it as a currency...
@_date: 2018-03-12 04:22:37
You really do not know what you are talking about (As the guy below me demonstrates).  Additionally - I would disagree about Bitcoin's "intended purpose."  Store of value is just as important as its ability to be used as a currency.
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:41:05
Ummm no.  I mean in 10 years I will be in my mid 30's, and I consider that "not old" lol.  When I say "older generation", I actually mean people above the age of 45.
Furthermore, I don't think "All old people" are dumb or bad.  But I do think the American Baby Boomer generation (on average) is one the most spoiled and selfish generation Earth has seen in a while.  I would love to debate that if you wish, but i believe it's a bit off topic lol.
P.S.  Even if YOU are a baby boomer, I am not saying YOU are bad.

I have not seen anyone ask these exact questions.  I would hope someone as enlightened as you might direct me to an answer instead of becoming instantly defensive...
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:34:17
Ummm no.
Bitcoin needs to stay above $5000 until a bull run reignites around the end of this year, or worst case scenario is Bitcoin needs to stay above $2000 till a bull run in 2020.
Anything above that and things are looking CRAZY good.  Previous crashes were FAR worse than this at the moment.   But if Bitcoin hits $1000 it will be VERY bad.

@_date: 2018-03-07 16:29:38
Yeah.  I mean those 2 coins are no brainers to list from a logical point of view.  High use rate compared to other coins of similar marketcap (especially Monero), proven developers, a long history of stability (especially DASH from 2014), and above all - distinguishing features!
TBH if those 2 aren't added, I don't think any other crypto would be worthy of being added lol.  At the very least I suspect they want to wait for at least some level of regulation to inadvertently bless privacy coins, for crypto to stop being dogged by mainstream media for being "Used for Illegal activities," or for some exchange to set a precedent that they can't be bothered for using privacy coins.   Maybe all 3...

Man there is a lot to unpack with you lol.
Nobody said "money makes you smart."  I simply pointed out that all investments have a certain amount of risk, and the smart answer is definitely not to never invest your money.
What I am trying to figure out now is which type of Bitcoin Troll you are:
1) The type that sold at the low and is trying to make himself feel better by calling Hodlr's dumb.
2) Some stupid teenager who feels emasculated by missing out on Bitcoin, and continues to tell himself he is smart for not understanding something.
3) Someone who likes Gold or Stocks, and hates BTC... Nah this one isn't you lol.  You seem too dumb for that... well maybe you are a Silver Bug or something lol.

For a second I was thinking Russia might make a truly Brilliant play: Adopt Bitcoin and crypto in order to trick their population into using a system they can monitor. Also, make Bitcoin look like the currency the "bad guys are using" on purpose in order to try and trick The West into fighting it.
But instead they will just continue to be woefully behind the rest of the world. This decision will simply cause the never-ending brain drain from Russia to continue...

Only you are buddy.   Japan, some US states, Switzerland, and the Netherlands are embracing crypto.  If some countries tried to kill it, they could do damage - but it would be almost pointless and not worth the effort.   If governments wanted to kill it, they should have done it in 2014.
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:58:33
Sure, I agree we should regulate centralized exchanges.  
But if we are going to hold them to the "same standards" as "The Financial System,"  does that mean we can allow crypto users to launder money for drug cartels without any threats of prison time?  That is what the "existing system" is allowed to do...

It's funny you say that, because one of my best friends asked me in mid-2017 if he should buy Bitcoin (After walking past one my many mining rigs in my house lol).   He said "I want to invest a few grand, but I feel like I missed the boat."
He said that to me again a week ago, and then I told him his current holdings would be worth double what he invested in early 2017; oh and I also told him my mining operation is bringing in almost as much money as my (lucrative) day job.  He just went "FUCK!  What am I doing?!"
I still don't think he has bought any...

This truly is another contributing factor to the rise of Bitcoin.
If you remove people's increasing wages, then they will naturally look for ways to compensate (People want more and more over time).  So they will use Airbnb, Ebay, and the "gig economy" to keep they standard of living.... And they will use Bitcoin to keep their wealth from deflating over time...

Unless he causes China to collapse (and therefore the US to collapse) from him chipping away at China's hollow economy for absolutely no reason.
A new Great Depression would NOT be good for BTC.  It would cause people to SELL their BTC to pay bills, and possibly scapegoat Bitcoin.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve is doing an excellent job of maintaining this economy.  GROW UP - the point of bitcoin is not to crash the world economy, it's to force people like the Federal Reserve to never TRY anything stupid ever again.
@_date: 2018-07-16 05:00:55
Yeah it's absurd the FUD going on by the custodians of the world trying to hold Bitcoin back.  Combine that with the common man's stubbornness and arrogance to think he is "smart for ignoring bitcoin", and it is understandable why it is taking so long in the west to catch on.

Overnight?  Nobody is "Rich overnight" from Bitcoin except for a HAND FULL of VERY lucky people who invested a ton of money at the same time (just like with penny stocks).
Most people have only invested moderate amounts, and waited a LONG time for it to mature into a decent bit of side money.
Oh, and Bitcoin is SUBSTANTIALLY easier to get a hold of then the effort required to set up an IRA.  Download the wallet in 10 seconds, and add some Bitcoin.  It IS easier.

There is no doubt that their actions suggest a certain degree of shadiness, but at the same time it seems incredibly odd to me how unnecessary it is for them to ruin a "good thing that's working out."  Don't get me wrong, I am not some naive guy that thinks things like "If this was corrupt, why would so many exchanges use it!?"   But I do think it is worth mentioning how many exchanges are migrating to utilizing USDT, and how much money Tether could make simply by NOT f***ing this up lol.
Personally I think Tether is mostly legit, but didn't put enough effort into things like record keeping or making sure their cash reserve was 100% at all times.  I think they WANT to be 100% audited and backed by cash, but they were lazy/inept several times in the past.  In the middle of being audited they likely realized there were a bunch of mistakes the audit would end up showing, and so they canceled it until they can get their sh*t together.
As such, what I am really asking you is: Do you actually think the ENTIRE operation is just one big scam?  Or could it be a Mt. Gox-like situation where ineptitude could kill them (Not that I am saying they are as stupid as the Gox people were lol).
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:28:54
I have a feeling Schnorr will be adopted WAY quicker than Segwit was.   The civil war is over, and Bcash has lost.

"Why would people sell BTC to pay bills?" - Because bills need to be paid LOL.
But really - your comment is hilarious.  Most people in this thread are advocating for the destructing of the US Economy and/or dollar.  Your bills still cannot be paid by BTC, so yeah - you will need to sell it when the rest of your savings go up in flames.
Economic collapses do not help genus, or at the very least they are unnecessary for BTC to succeed.
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:47:26
It would depend on the situation, but even right now a single Vega will make you the equivalent of about 0.1 Bitcoin a year (Thus paying for itself).
If Bitcoin hit $1000, it's difficulty would be significantly less.  Yes, I think college kids (for example) would be more than happy to simply mine during few semesters for their card to pay for itself.
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:17:48
No there wouldn't be, not yet.  Bitcoin is simply not ready for that kind of traffic, and most people don't actually know how to get Bitcoin.  It would be a massacre of inept people rushing for a door, except they don't even know what the "door" looks like.  A lot would simply buy Gold and other assets if this happened within a year.
Not to mention who cares if the Dollar collapses?!  How does that help Bitcoin if JUST the dollar collapses?  Sure 1 BTC might equal $1 Million,  but who cares if it costs $100K for dinner?!  It wouldn't help Bitcoin at all lol.
What people should be rooting for is a slow burn whereby Bitcoin sustainably gains value as its network continues to be upgraded.  Then like 10 years from now (when most people have some), an economic crisis forces it to be as mainstream as the dollar.  That's the best way for this to pan out.  Toppling the dollar helps no one except the egos of people who never worked for a dollar...

I have to say that almost all of these Wrong Predictions by Experts have 1 thing in common:  A complete lack of imagination.

Not sure I think too highly of that family, but this actually is a big deal in some regards.

Even more important is that she actually showed Bitcoin, and not some shitcoin or ICO scam.
@_date: 2018-07-10 05:27:54
But what do you mean by "cost"?  Once you set up the rigs (assuming you don't overclock unresponsively), you can just let them run.  So it only costs electricity, and A LOT of people have free or near free electricity.  A lot of people building mining complexes also have a ton of money already - they can afford to not profit for years and HODL their mined money if needed.
The economics are not as simple as people say.  Most Mega-Mining firms are making them for (Allegedly) $1000-$2500, and if it ever became unprofitable then people with free energy would run one mini rig each.  There is always someone with cheaper energy, but it isn't always possible for said person to "scale up."  But there are a lot of people...

@_date: 2018-07-31 19:38:56
Make no mistake - I don't have any trouble imagining a better world.  But I disagree your wonderland is possible, or if it would even be good if it was.
Yes, humanity should continue to strive for a higher median standard of living and more egalitarianism.  But removing competition simply **cannot work - that punishes the hardest working people.  We need them to make our world better.**
What you are advocating for is a world where people who cure cancer (for example) are not awarded for their hard work for humanity.   Again, PLEASE take note that **money=value.  If you want to fix injustice, then you need to work towards making the means of earning money more fair.  But removing money means removing value.  Money is just how we assign value.**
Furthermore, this idea that "one person's gain is another person's loss" is wholly UNTRUE.  The standard of living in the world is better for **EVERYONE**.  This is something I studied in anthropology classes.  
I will leave you with this fact:  
\-"Extreme Poverty" means making less money  per day than you need to afford enough food/shelter.  
\-Right now less than 10% of the world lives in extreme poverty.
\-**It was 45% in 1990!**
\-It was **95% in 1900!!!!**
\^\^\^ That means even though there is "increasing polarization of wealth" we are still **ALL** becoming better off over time**.  That directly disproves the notion that you have to take from others to become rich.  Clearly, that is not true.  The rich may be getting richer, but humanity as a whole is still living substantially better on average every deca**de.
@_date: 2018-07-16 01:02:05
Very self congratulatory and preachy, but an alright read nonetheless.   If true, kudos!
I agree with the overall sentiment though.  I am sticking with my gut from now on when people ask me about Bitcoin - I have been right 100% of the time until now.  Bitcoin will be above $100K by 2020, and likely closer to $1 Million by 2025.

You see this what Bcash people (and many dumb altcoin people) don't get - It wasn't about "block size," it was about if ANY upgrade was worth a hardfork at this point. 
The concencus was that it was NOT worth it.  As a result, a very small (~10% minority) forked off to make their own idiot coin.
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:08:12
Whatever people are willing to pay to mine a Bitcoin.  That's it lol.
Idk why some people are so obsessed with "The cost of mining."  You really can't quantify it the same way you do standard manufacturing costs.  The economics of mining are new and radically different from almost anything that has come before it.
@_date: 2018-07-16 07:32:49
If Bitcoin gets high fees, it's BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO USE IT THAT BADLY.  High fees follow popularity, not the other way around.
Furthermore, the soonest I could see fees ever get close to $50 again (which never really happened in a meaningful way), is if somehow Bitcoin rockets to $100K by fall of this year.  I don't see that happening.
The next bull run is most likely to start some time in 2019 or 2020.  By then Segwit will be at 60%+ adoption, schnorr will probably be implemented, good lightning wallets will be available, and atomic swaps to Litecoin may be even be available as an emergency "off-ramp."  Fees will not be an issue lol.
The only time fees will be $50 again, is in some distant year like 2040 where lightning channels are paying $50 to clear millions of transactions at once.
@_date: 2018-07-17 00:52:37

@_date: 2018-07-15 06:39:21
Absolutely.  If they really wanted to make this "Bcash": they would stop the "halving" (so miners are always compensated), add another 4 decimal places, and make the "minimum" fee one satoshi instead of "satoshi per byte."

But drop the attacks, you clearly do not understand what is being discussed.  That fiat you mention can be confiscated, and if the world economy collapsed - it likely would be by governments taken over by leftist idiots who blame the rich.  
Additionally it seems like you have no concept of how interconnected various markets are.  What you are saying is literally as stupid as someone saying "I hope the housing market collapses because it will strengthen the stock market."  That isn't what happened though kids - there was widespread panic, and entire banks failed.  People lost their savings in many cases who did nothing wrong.  This helps no one, this would not help Bitcoin.

The fallacy of your argument is thinking of money as anything but of how we assign value or "quality."
If you want to see "exponential gains in our quality of life," then you should remove the unfair ways money is used/assigned.  Getting rid of money/capitalism solves nothing.  Truly smart people realize that we just need to get better at how we assign value.  Value will always be assigned.

I think something Tone Vays recently said was very accurate to what's going on right now: 
"This bounce was unexpected and could be very good.   But this bounce is either a return to a Bull Market, or it could also mean this Bear Market is actually going to take longer to bottom out than it did in 2014-2015..."

Oh yeah - EOS, NEO, Tron, and Iota are all on borrowed time.

I am starting to become of the opinion that the "debt crash" everyone keeps talking about will happen a bit farther out than people suspect (2-4 years from now), and it won't be the apocalyptic crash gold bugs and anarchists say will happen.
I would say it will be bad, and probably be very comparable to the one in the 80's.  We have learned enough to not go full retard like we did in 2007, but at the same time this cycle of rapid debt accumulation will have to stop.
The only thing I could see making a crash truly terrible would be if China defaulted at the same time America did due to China's hollow economy collapsed by unneeded tariffs....

Haha I somewhat agree that Russia has to basically just shut up and take it, but there ARE still 2,000 US troops in Syria.
One could say they are a definite target now, and while I do not think Russia would be brazen enough to mount a direct ground offensive against US forces there; I could see them do something indirect like funnel ISIS fighters and "Syrian Volunteers" towards US  bases to inflict casualties.
After that, who knows if Trump would be dumb (smart?) enough to escalate things further...

I mean I agree with the guy: $100,000 is only if the market comes close to matching precious metals.  After that you would also assume cryptocurrencies will replace "surrogate currencies" like the USD and EURO being used in non-native countries out of desperation.
So in my opinion Bitcoin should conservatively be worth $50K-$250K within 5 years.  However perhaps a million dollars temporarily if you add speculation and replacement of even more industries.
But idk 1 million by 2020 is still unrealistic for me.  Sorry McAfee's penis...

@_date: 2018-07-16 14:55:20
I am certain because I use bitcoin often enough to see the differences in real time, and I can do the math myself.
-Right now it cost ~10 cents to get a transaction into the next block.  Usually I can get it in under an hour if I pay less than a 1 cent fee.
-Thus if the price goes to $100K and demand skyrockets even TOMORROW, nobody should be paying more than $10 fees unless they are idiots (exchanges) overpaying. That is because current segwit usage is making Bitcoin effectively have over 2MB blocks.
-Again, by the end of 2018 Segwit usage should be high enough to make Bitcoin up to around 2.5 or 3MB blocks.  That will easily be big enough to hold Bitcoin over till Schnorr (and other softforks) effectively increase blocksize another 10-40%.  By the end of 2020, lightning will make this entire discussion a joke.

You know what I won't be someone who just comes in here and preaches with religious fervor "HODL HODL", because frankly that is stupid.
But I will try to comfort you by admitting that I too - wavered a little today.  Breaking below $9000 was scary, and I seriously considered selling half of my holdings.  But then I looked here:
^  I recommend looking through this as it is bizarre to see the roller-coaster ride others have have had to withstand.  If you think this is bad, consider 7 years ago when Bitcoin crashed from $30 to $3.  That's a 10x drop in value buddy.
I myself make it through the 2014-2015 period where Bitcoin went from $1000, to $180.  A 5-6x drop in value that was excruciating to watch as a poor college student.  But take notice that it wasn't a 10x drop!
Thus if we are to consider this as a trend (that isn't going to die), I would say 2018 could see Bitcoin hit as low as ~$5000 (But I am hoping $7000 is the lowest it goes).   I know that's scary to hear, but then you need to ask yourself this: "Fundamentally, has anything really changed for the worse for Bitcoin?"
The answer in my opinion, is a resounding NO.   Japan is fully embracing Bitcoin to the point that they are instituting it into their banking system, TONS of online retailers in Asia are showing support for it, Square and Robinhood just announced they are accepting it, and transaction fees are already heading near Zero again now that the Mania is cooling off.  If you ignore the price drop, January is one of the best months for Bitcoin news IN HISTORY.  As such I am not selling.
I would recommend selling a little bit here and there during days the price is up just to make sure you keep some of your profits, but then again I am a miner (so I keep getting more anyways).  After that, all you can do is HODL, diversify, and most importantly - stop watching the price every 10 minutes!!!  Close the browser and enjoy life!  We should all expect Bitcoin to take at least 8 months or more before we get close to the previous highs (although 3 years is also very possible based on past trends).

Shorting in crypto is ridiculously risky.  I cash out some money when we get "good days" like this, but imo only a fool would short any crypto.

You can see the sentiment changing though.  More and more people working in crypto are now confident enough to directly say "Bitcoin.  Not Blockchain" on mainstream TV.  This is quite different from 2016.
However change does not mean the journey is over - you can still see that we are in the "bear trap" before the "mass adoption phase."  Bitcoin is now a name everyone has HEARD of, but not quite to the point that everyone knows what it is (Like "social media" in 2006).  For instance I recently went to r/ investing and mentioned adding Bitcoin to someone's portfolio, and most responses to my comment seriously were: "Wait, Bitcoin is still a thing?!"     People have heard of Bitcoin, but that's about it.
However there are only so many times someone can ask "That didn't die?", before they realize it is never going to die...

That's a cute High School Essay, but again you are missing the point.  And I will requote this passage:
"The threshold can easily be changed in the future.  We can decide to increase it when the time comes.  It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed.  If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use."
The TEMPORARY high transaction fees in late 2017 were EXACTLY what Satoshi put the limit in place for: The bitcoin network was spammed, it was not actual use.  It did not NEED to be higher at the time - get over it.
Now comes an even short quote of the same passage: "We can decide to change it when the time comes."
Let me shorten it again: "We"
The network voted, and the network decided that a Hardfork for blocksize increases is not worth it right now.  Get over it.  Decentralization means changes come from the BOTTOM up, not from a select few.  
Bcash IS a select few.  Bcash tried to force an agenda on the majority.  Satoshi hasn't spoken for years because he understands that this only works if he lets the consensus decide.  The consensus is certainly not Bcash lol.

This is the correct answer.  We are still in a bear market, but things are looking slightly more promising on this "dead cat bounce" than I expected.
We need to hold above ~$7500 for at least a week I would say, and then we need to finally break $10,000 again (and stay above $9000 after that) before I would say any bear market is gone.
If this does happen, well then I expect a slow bull market that climbs to $30-50K by the end of the year, and then another explosion of growth in 2019 as FOMO kicks in.
However if we dip below 7K within a couple days, I expect a drop to below $5K before May - and hopefully that will be the floor.  If it isn't... well then we would go $2K...
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:18:18
My main issue is with what you consider "The community."  Most people around here straight up do not know what they are talking about, and most posts are "When will the price go up again?!"  Oh and your Schnorr example only underlines my point: If that few people in a given Bitcoin community know of Schnorr, then that community is not informed.  Developers are fascinated by it right now.
That is why I bring up how ACTUAL change happens in the Bitcoin Network - Stakeholders signal which upgrades they support.  Those actual stake holders voted in the majority to forego a hardfork because it WOULD NOT solve scaling issues sufficiently to warrant the risks it would require.
With regards to your concern of Transaction fees: Segwit + batching IS working as intended (fees are now lower than many altcoins).  If another Spam Attack happened (Like in November 2017), then it would indeed raise fees; but no where near as much as before.  It is impossible to quantify what fees would be for sure though. 
But to get to your initial focus: I think this community is a good place to go to for stirring up discussions and gauging the temperature, but I haven't seen any indication that consensus opinions around here push change.  The reality is that people around here parrot what their favorite Bitcoin Youtuber tells them, and a lot of youtubers are saying Segwit/lighting are awesome lol.
Hope I am making you think ;)

@_date: 2018-04-03 01:59:17
No offense, but some of the questions in your survey are a bit flawed.  For example Segwit ITSELF is not an end-solution.  It is really a combination of a short term upgrade and an opening of a door to more scaling solutions.
Without Segwit there is no Lighting or Schnorr (not on your list?!).
Furthermore it's odd you are asking rando's on Reddit to vote.  The real community that controls Bitcoin DID vote - and they signaled for Segwit.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:01:54
So far in 2018, I have ONLY paid 1 sat/byte; and the transaction has always gone through.
There is maybe 1 exception in January where it took 2 days to finally clear, but conversely every transaction I have sent in the past month has been confirmed in under a few hours.  
I will say that again:  ALL of my 1 sat/byte transactions have cleared in under a few hours in the past month.

@_date: 2018-04-30 01:30:30
To be honest, further enhancements will be needed.  But it's ok because Segwit, lighting, and soon Schnorr are just the LATEST (not the last) enhancements.
Just off the top of my head I can think of two more that will follow soon:
1) Atomic swaps would allow bitcoin to use Litecoin and Monero "off ramps".  That would easily alleviate scaling issue for another long while.
2) If there is ever consensus for it (And "moore's law" catches up), 2 or 4MB blocks COULD be added.  
The point is fees are still quite under control, and even in the foreseeable future Lightning/Segwit/Schnorr should make fees lower than they are now.  Eventually there are way more enhancements ALREADY on the table, and I am sure more will be invented/discovered every year...

I think it's pretty clear at this point that the majority of BCH supporters are either a) Bagholders looking for the price to go up so they can get out, or b) "bad actors" who simply want artificial competition in order to benefit their business models (Bitmain, BitPay, etc).  In other words, I don't think any changes will convince these people to dump their altcoin.
It stopped being "about the tech" months ago.  Bitcoin's fee problems are under control for the short term, and lightning is taking off way faster than expected.
P.S.  Bitcoin still does have 2-4MB blocks in its future according to most developers I have seen speak.  But these increases will only come when there is total consensus in the community, and that's how it should be.

I think you are missing the point: Numerous quotes from Satoshi shows he was in favor of BOTH on-chain and off-chain scaling proposals depending on how things progressed.   Nobody can say EITHER "Satoshi wanted bigger blocks!" or "Satoshi wanted small blocks!"  Both statements would be incorrect.
The fact is Satoshi initially had no blocksize limits, and he ALSO is the one who added them.  Unless you can call him up right now, we do not know what he currently thinks lol.   What he actually wanted was for bottom-up consensus to drive Bitcoin's upgrades, and that is what happened.  The general consensus in the community was that bigger blocksizes, while nice on paper; did not solve Bitcoin's longterm scaling problems efficiently.  They also required dangerous hardforking.
The community has spoken: Segwit is the short term solution, and it opens the door for adding long term solutions.  That doesn't mean just lightning, it also means other creative means of efficiently reducing Transaction Costs/Weight (like schnorr).

Well first of all - you (and everyone) should regret not selling more at $19K.  Hindsight is 20/20, but if you *have the hindsight* you should wish you sold then and bought it all back now at 1/5th the price!
Second, let's say for example that someone has 20 Bitcoin:
1) I get why they didn't sell at $1200 in 2013 - **$20,000 isn't a life changing amount of money (Thought nice).**
2) However I would hope this person sold a *few* at $19K.    A total of $50K-$100K made is a nice chunk of change to tide you over for a few years or reinvest in the S&amp;P500 (Or a new house for your family!).   **However yes, you should have kept most of your BTC if you believe in it.**
3) Once Bitcoin gets into the $50K-$200K region, I would seriously hope you consider selling 1/3rd to half of it.  I mean seriously life is short.  Who cares if it keeps going up?  If you are 50 years old and have 50 Million Dollars.... Is that really any better than having $10 Million when you are young, and $10 Million left over at 50 years old?  I don't think so.  **Enjoy your life, or there was no point in living it!**

Yeah, that's my point.  A 1 million dollar Bitcoin before 2030 would only happen imo if the dollar (and many other fiats possibly) collapsed in value.
Yes, I mean faster than usual.

What I am saying is that nobody should be wishing for an epic crash of the markets - that would suck for everyone.  A crash is a crash - everyone loses (Even Bitcoin holders).

If Bitcoin is worth a million dollars in under 10 years.... it's probably because USD has inflated to 1/10th its current value...

So you are "one of the smart ones"? 
You strike me either as someone who panic sold in 2014, or someone who just lost untolds amount of money in the stock market this quarter - and you are now trolling to feel better.
Or maybe your someone with zero savings, and you are just bitter.  Sad.

You seem to genuinely understand very little.   In fact you strike me as someone who bought at $11K, and just sold at $4K.  
Now you are seeing Bitcoin hold at $3K and it's worrying you. You could could be one of those 1/1000 idiots who made every bad choice possible...
Not saying it won't go lower, it probably will temporarily.  But it makes you worry doesn't it?
