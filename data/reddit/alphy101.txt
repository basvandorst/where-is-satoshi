idk what to do... Do I buy?
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:33:08
Sorry for asking advice, dickwad.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:49:46
“Kid” bruh go home this is Reddit and you act like a self made billionaire who has it all. Go home dude
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:35:31
Maybe you should move along and be a millionair since you know exactly what to do, when to and how to do it.

Sorry to ask but what do you mean with my “private key”
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:23:46
So they can pretty much take my bitcoins and do whatever. And if I store my bitcoins in a wallet how could I sell them through my wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:12:38
What is Satoshi? I keep hearing it over and over
Edit: dumb of me. Googled it. Interesting world this Cryptocurency
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:32:06
Well what would you recommend to someone living in the europe? Kraken?
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:45:33
So how can I cut the middleman out of it then?
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:48:44
Thanks for saying that. I will definitely not say hodl. I will shout it from the rooftops to put fear in those naysayers and those that want to get rich on the spot. HODL

Can you explain more about the whole Coinbase situation when the price plummets? You mean I can sell my Bitcoin through that wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:31:57
Exactly because alot (and I actually mean ALOT) of people have been going to Coinbases’s customer service since that 1.5k dip three days earlier and it got me thinking the same way you just explained it
Might need to get a wallet after all.
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:47:41
Honestly dude this is actually one of those comments I expected and kinda hoped to get because now I actually legit understand it. Thanks
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:47:47
Okay so I get it I think. It's legit a hardware wallet where you safekeep your coins and when you want to sell it you just do it ASAP through an exchange? am I getting it right?
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:46:57
Exactly why I looked up for reliable alternatives. When BTC plummeted about 1.5k like three days ago I couldn’t access it to invest. So here I am with money that could’ve been invested and now can’t.
So you can send money through trezor that converts it into btc and “loads” it up in your wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:18:44
So pretty much a note that says you own “this” and that’s it?
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:26:18
In here for a long time, not a good time.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:25:31
I think it is but it’s much more based in the States, I’m guessing
@_date: 2019-09-28 09:50:40
It only took five seconds to answer that.
