You could accomplish this with a trustworthy market maker willing to hold large amounts of prepaid card numbers. Market maker sells btc for prepaid card numbers and buys btc with prepaid card numbers.
With prepaid cards you can use them at any cash checking place to liquidate them into cash. 
All one needs is blank cards and a card writer to transfer the card number to a physical card.
As for fraud, the market maker could put a hold on btc withdrawals until prepaid cards transactions have cleared. 
As for chargebacks, check cashing facilities are insured, and in the case of a chargeback in this situation 9 times out of 10 the prepaid card is linked a real identity so scamming immediately creates a paper trail. 
This is similar to how people used to trade moneypaks for btc before green dot was forced to register users' social security numbers.

PSA: Ask to review the insurance policy of any exchange of which you may become a customer if they claim to be insured. Policies insured by fiat reserves will inevitably scam you of your BTC. If they get hacked especially during a price spike, and you lose your funds. You may only receive a fraction of your original BTC when trying to settle. It's better explained where I reported on BitGo's insurance policy here:




tl;dr **Unless your Bitcoins will be replaced 100% by Bitcoin in case of loss, the insurance policy will likely result in a BTC loss in the event of a catastrophic loss.**

It's called market depth. The more skin you put in the game the more difficult it is to exit. As you sell of your stash the price declines as your market sell orders hit the book. They're may not be enough demand to support that large of an exit.

Hedging on the future is bad financial advice. Even if said bet is a "sure thing" you don't know the actual outcome of the future until the moment arrives. This is like someone living outside of their means because "I'll be rich in the future so I can afford to go into massive debt, since I've been getting bigger bonuses every year." Until the bottom falls out and you're stuck with a bunch of debt you cannot pay off.

What the actual fuck people?!?
FDIC insurance cannot be applied to Bitcoin. If a bank gets robbed the FED prints more money as its insurance policy and gives it to the bank.
This CANNOT exist in Bitcoin because the supply is fixed. If Bitcoins are lost and are insured with fiat what happens is you get paid at cost in dollars for said lost Bitcoins. Then what? You and the other insured claimers flood the market with bids to recoup their lost bitcoins causing the value to go up so in reality you will acquire less coins than you originally had.

How is a hard fork a good thing? It breaks the old consensus rules and replaces this with new ones. Proving Bitcoin can hard fork means there is a chance you could change the inflation schedule or other valuable consensus rules that should never change.  A hard fork needs to be the most absolutely difficult thing for Bitcoin to do to prevent it from being used as an attack vector.
I hope I don't live to see the debate where people debate for a different inflation schedule.

When a larger block is mined, nodes who have not upgraded will reject the block and continue to listen for a block they believe is valid. Eventually a block that is valid to them will arrive, splitting the chain in two.
Sure if 90% of miners indicate they are ready for the hard fork, in an ideal world this would indicate 90% of the hashing power will go to the new fork. This does not mean 90% of the network will accept a larger block if mined.

A lot of those people no longer have their coins. One or two "bum investments" or scams and you're back to square 0. Bitcoin is pretty unforgiving in this regard. But that wasn't really my point.
A complete meritocracy assumes that people's abilities are known-knowns. If this were the case with Bitcoin, Hearn would have amounted to much more, given he was merit-washed by Google. 
Those who are industrious could be extremely unknown by merit discovery means (or their implementations), but "earn" their keep and accumulate wealth. Bitcoin allows for this to realistically occur. Look at such businesses as Satoshi Dice or Just Dice that were essentially Bitcoin money machines for investors. 
There will always be means to separate people from their coins. Bitcoin ideally makes the separation harder thus real value must be created for someone to spend said coins. Why spend money on something useless when you can buy a Bitcoin today? Why spend a Bitcoin today when it'll likely be worth a lot more in a few years?
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:52:15
"Because that would be crippling Bitcoin's capabilities"
I could say the reverse, that changing the production quota without blocks being full would result in less capital available to mine thus crippling Bitcoin security. Gavin already stated twice in a published medium: "I don't know how we're going to pay for Bitcoin security in the future." Don't you think we should solve THAT problem first before anything else? If not it seems like you're just hodling "to get rich quick."
"inflationary reward is enough"
The inflationary reward is not enough. The result of the price correction will be an inevitable drop in the hash rate. Miner profit margins are razor thin. Davout elaborates on this point in the IRC discussion which you obviously didn't read.

High tier universities traditionally aggregate the best and brightest into a single trust, perhaps research a list of the current CEO's in Fortune 500 companies and link them to their alma maters. 
The sewage is systematically filtered out through the application process. Thus "But a diploma from Harvard and Yale means much more than a good score at the free Khan Academy" isn't an argument here, because it disregards the Eternal September phenomenon. I was once told, "You can't fix stupid". If you aren't cool enough to get accepted to MIT on a full ride and then drop out to create a multi-million dollar business, Khan Academy likely won't facilitate the production of a dissertation worth reading.

This is where the Web of Trust comes into play. You vet things based on your competence and look to educate yourself with teachers you trust. Bitcoin is not only an experiment in finance, but gives you economic tools to build a network of trustworthy people.
A great analogy someone made to me was the AK-47. Soldiers who had one issued would take the gun completely apart and learn how every piece works. If gun jammed on battlefield and you died, it was your fault for not checking the gun or gaining the necessary knowledge to maintain the thing.
The recent failings in open source is from a lack of scrutiny when publishing code. The code is out there, but how many people "actually" read it?

The reason the price is as high as it is, is because the large holders allow it. If Hearn were truly a "super whale", his exit would have caused a much more catastrophic crash in the price. It only takes 100k BTC to sink the price:


The will of the majority doesn't dictate what Bitcoin does, it's the will of those who have earned the most Bitcoins. Fortunately most of those people are sane and rational.
To see this rationally: Satoshi stated 1 CPU = 1 Vote. Who is going to own the most CPU's? The most wealthy have easier access to computational power than someone with limited means, thus don't the wealthy get more votes? If 1mn people have 1 CPU each. But 3 wealthy people have 10mn CPU's, does the majority really matter in this case?

Arguments like these hold no weight because it's implying that Bitcoin is a democratic process upheld by laws. A conflict of interest would be if a judge personally knows a defendant in a criminal case, thus would have to recuse themselves for the benefit of the justice system.
Bitcoin is a sovereign entity with no laws and infinite freedom. You are free to defraud people (although this is morally wrong), you are free to enter contracts with other peers voluntarily, you are free to do whatever pleases you. However your actions are only as strong as your economic will, and as such like in Darwinian terms, the weak will inevitably yield to the strong if they are to survive. This is why honesty, respect and trust in Bitcoin goes a long way. 
If someone with economic power trust someone and shares said economic power with another, even a million of the majority shouting at them will not break that trust. I.E. "loyalty to the end". Respect and trust must be earned and freely given. Demanding respect will never work as this amounts to coercion in most cases.
As for the conflict of interest, there can be no conflict of interest in Bitcoin. Only conflicting interests of private entities. You are basically saying "Blockstream doesn't have the right to organize as a company and do business in the Bitcoin world and contribute to the development process." You want to TAKE that right from them, whereas you have just as much freedom and rights as they do, but are limited in financial and economic resources. 
tl;dr Every time someone shouts "conflict of interest" in this space I hear "I want to oppress on someone else's freedom!"

Well this level of softfork generally disenfranchises old nodes by making them unable to verify transactions they send. They have to upgrade to see confirmations after X date. This is no better than a hard fork.

The network effect concludes that a system is more valuable as more users are on boarded, as is the case with telephones or telegraphs. What it fails to address is the Eternal September problem which has plagued the internet for decades. Even though this is a modern phenomenon, it was accurately predicted by Aldous Huxley in the 1930's with his novel Brave New World. 
The best way to visualize this phenomenon is like so: Imagine on the Bitcoin network there are 100 people. 1 of these people is an honest business man the other 99 are scammers of some sort (imagine 99 pirateat40's). Now imagine a network of 15 people, each one an honest businessman doing honest work. The first network has more raw utility as it is made up of more people, however the second network is more valuable.

I think you completely missed my point in which I was describing the problem of too much money. VC fuel is deadly to a business in Bitcoin  - they require growth in terms of fiat to be deemed successful rather than the actual value they provide Bitcoin.
Bitpay hasn't really provided any value to Bitcoin, for every merchant they have on boarded, I'd rather just pay with a credit card. Why? Because why would I ever spend my coins on junk, the fiat mentality is "to spend" where as the Bitcoin mentality is "to conserve/save". 
I've used 0 of the open source tools Bitpay has crafted because they aren't really coded that well or even remotely trustworthy to my standards, and given I view Bitcoin finance as being more precious then fiat finance, the bar is extremely high there. So what Bitpay has done is spent millions of dollars on something that could have essentially been done for far far less, with two employees rather than the armada the amassed before the layoffs.
Coinbase is just a bank operating in Bitcoin land. What value do they provide vs. the risk? It's another company run with completely insane leadership. They refuse to segregate the fiat side with the bitcoin side as Paymium does in France. This creates an issue where Coinbase is liable to stay even more compliant than a bank rather than offsetting said liability to banking partners that hold custodial fiat accounts for the customers. For instance: just yesterday I asked coinbase support if I would be required to provide my pay-stubs if my source of income to buy or sell Bitcoins came from a paycheck. A normal bank would NEVER ask for this sort of information. The physical paycheck deposited or an ACH credit into the account is more than enough to satisfy them. If Coinbase segregated these operations, customers could take back more privacy.
From what I can tell 21inc is a borderline scam. The company created high end mining chips in secret that became obsolete before they were paid for now they are offloading them to users.
I've never used purse.io and as an educated Bitcoin user why should I? What innovation is here? Gift cards are straight up scams. Do you know why large companies love selling giftcards? It's pretty much a bond with 0 interest. Gift cards usually have an expiration on them where the funds allocated on the card revert back to the company, in this case it's like a bond with negative interest. Some gift cards have an expiration fee attached that devalue the card to 0 after a certain date. Companies that issue gift cards don't want you to use it cause it increases their margins/cash flow. 
Factom needs VC money why? You realize  does exactly this for free (provided you're in the appropriate Web of Trust).
None of this is useful by a long shot, or moreover none of it is useful to the value VC's have placed on these companies.
Now don't get me wrong I'm not anti-venture capital, I'm anti Venture stupidity. If a company raises millions of dollars in funding, burns though most of that capital, and needs to convince people they've done something useful, something is seriously wrong. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:43:58
Fall of 2014 Bitpay had about 8 months of reserve capital at current burn rate. Since they were doing the "free products buy some support", they weren't profitable. The most recent round of layoffs (like 20 people or so), could probably extend that lifespan from 8 months to about 2-3 years. It's fucking retarded to have such an insane burn rate in BTC, since you can't fake growth like you would in the fiat world of Silicon Valley.
If Coinbase has the same problem I'd expect layoffs first, but given the loon Armstrong is I have no idea what would transpire there.
Point is that you can't just keep asking for more money to delay the inevitable. Coinbase and Bitpay are likely in a position where they either become profitable with the money they have left, or do something like "raise the block limit" or "fix Bitcoin" so VC's are willing to invest in another round of funding. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 01:43:46
Most of the VC fueled companies in Bitcoin right now are struggling to make a profit because they aren't doing useful things. It's as if image became everything after the Facebook start-up boom in the late 2000's.
Bitcoin is like a giant spotlight, you can't obfuscate your business model, then use weird "cheat codes" to make a profit. You actually have to put in tangible work that provides value to harness a profit.
So I honestly ask, what kind of value do these "venture" that are limited by Bitcoin's blockchain capacity intend to bring to Bitcoin?
Bitcoin isn't just a payment network, it's a new way of thinking about finance. This is why you should try to avoid using Visa as a comparison. 
For instance: Holding US dollars is a guaranteed loss due to inflation. IIRC a nickel pre-WWII has the purchasing power a dollar has today. This forces any business to invest its money, yes it's good to have cash on hand for various operational needs of the business, but the capital NEEDS to be invested or it will net a loss. 
Bitcoin does not have this problem. 1 Bitcoin today will be 1 Bitcoin tomorrow. This has been seen in practice for companies that only operate in Bitcoin. These companies minimize expenses to the bare minimum some even sacrifice labor costs via salaries, and instead pay employees through stock warrants or a share in profits (Thus if the company is profitable the employees make money). Thus a heavily Bitcoin capitalized company can just hold the Bitcoin if there is nothing worthwhile in which to invest, the capital can be held without fear of a guaranteed loss.
Many will argue "what if the price goes down?" This is irrelevant, because a Bitcoin company should fundamentally be able to weather price volatility, be it through insuring it's capital via futures contracts or options (although this is an added expense), or having a business model that doesn't rely on the fiat price per coin. 
What Bitcoin needs isn't a block size increase, or even more VC fueled companies that won't see a profit in BTC. Bitcoin needs sanely managed ventures that provide real value to Bitcoin by providing one or many of the cornucopia of useful things that's lacking. If you truly think "mass adoption" by onboarding more people to Bitcoin to just "use it" in lieu of fiat is one of those useful things, then you're not thinking hard enough.

Bitcoin is anti-socialist in favor of anarcho-capitalism. This was very evident in the early days of Bitcoin. 
In socialistic democracy everyone is seen as equal. Each person has an equal vote, although this isn't **really** the case in most democratic societies. This is what the consumer majority of Bitcoin has "come to expect".
In anarcho-capitalism which Bitcoin facilitates, each individual is a sovereign entity. Individuals may freely align themselves together and form groups that are also sovereign. The ruling class here are those who have accumulated the most wealth. In Bitcoin wealth accumulation is significantly different than in the fiat world. Here there is truly an equal playing field - if you are useful and provide value to society there is class mobility. 
I'm almost certain Satoshi came to this realization early on based on his "1 CPU 1 vote" mechanism. One person can own multiple CPU's, thus those with the most resources have the most votes.

Yes indeed. My point is more that Soft Forks could possibly disenfranchise unnecessarily (a nuclear option), the ideal scenario would be the way NO_OP codes have been implemented into new ones. Allowing for old clients to ignore multi-sig et. al. tx's that are non-standard until they enter a standard tx space. The nuclear option creates a black hole where tx's can't be viewed as valid.

Well Bitcoin has severely broken edge, which is why the original transaction  is FUBAR and the network won't relay it. It's detecting a double-spend which isn't really the case. I'm confident it'll be figured out.

The United States does charge people a use the US Dollar. Albeit obfuscated in the form of both inflation and income taxes (all receipt of cash must be declared so it can be assessed for taxes), although there are other ways. It's used as a reserve currency, because guns and nukes.
Bitcoin has no direct competition because it's retained some of most talented people in the world or as one of my favorite quote states it:
"Bitcoin is in fact first and foremost a wonderful community of highly skilled, intelligent and open minded people which tearfully reminds one of the old days of the pre-September Internet."
As stated in another of my comments which you may not have read, the network is valuable because valuable people use it. If 15 people who are legitimate businessmen and provide value to society, are using the network, it is about 15x more valuable of a network than 99 scammers using the same network infrastructure for ponzis, shady businesses, etc. and only 1 legitimate businessmen. This is an irrefutable fact.
The network effect has a problem: the eternal September. This problem was yet to be solved until Bitcoin existed.

Okay as for a note, that maffs were done on the expenses needed to operate as you were.
At minimum you would want to mine your transaction once per day, this requires 0.5% of the current hashrate at current difficulty:
* Current nethash: 883447751.875
* 0.5% of nethash: 4417238.75938
* Cost per gigahash at approx. wholesale value: $0.07/ghs
* Cost of investment for hashpower to mine 1block/day: $309206.71
Note that difficulty goes up and you'd eventually have to upgrade. Now tell me would any SANE person really want to spend enough money to buy a decent sized American home just to mine $1 txs?
Honestly these prices are likely going to go up as Bitcoin gets older so it's only inevitable microtransactions get knocked off the chain. They had a good run in Bitcoins early days, (cause you know 100 BTC used to be like a dollar at one point), but now not so much.

Although the fiat bankers could just turn on the fiat printers and buy as many BTC as possible, this would inevitably make the shadowy whales extremely well endowed.

You can't bootstrap a node on AWS for 12 bucks a month. More like 50 due to I/O limitations, so you'll need an SSD block to store it to bootstrap quickly.
The memfootprint is pretty high if you don't increase fee relay to a certain point.
Most AWS nodes are ending up on blacklist because people are using them to DDoS other nodes (node warfare). 
In the next 5 years I have a feeling there will be no point in putting nodes on AWS or a VPS.
Additionally in the next 5 years if you haven't bootstrapped a node and backed up the full blockchain, you likely won't be able to without a computer that has extremely fast I/O. (I/O latency is the main bottleneck to bootstrapping a new node.)
Also bandwidth is mostly consumed in relaying transactions, not relaying blocks. Particularly if your node connects to a "spammy node", you'll keep getting hit with the same set of transactions sucking up all your bandwidth, the only way to prevent it is by upping the relay fee.
Making the blocksize bigger could very possibly make this situation worse as people will find it cheaper to spam the mempool, or they may even be able to fill blocks with 0-fee transactions. 
Either way it's becoming significantly more difficult to hold onto archival nodes. I'm actually surprised there hasn't been a vocal push for a hardfork to make the limit smaller.

There are smart Ether ~holders~ huffers. No one is all bad. There are those who said "Do not invest in the DAO it's untested" but people still did and hyped it. Now that the DAO is too big to fail, these same people are against the "emergency forks" that serve as a bailout mechanism for DAO investors.
The Ether holders you speak of tho, are the ones who hyped the DAO and spit on Bitcoin since it wouldn't raise its blocksize so it could have it's own DAO. The reason Bitcoin is good, is because it resists idiocy and discards it pretty quickly by removing capital form the hands of the gullible and uneducated.
Unfortunately smart, diligent people can also be malicious and evil.

Revenue - Expense = Profit. 
Most low income families in America ( &lt; 15k-30k a year ) end up having a negative number in the profit variable. As you increase their income they spend more. Those who don't know how to budget their money appropriately who lived in poverty will end up spending way too much as their income increases. For instance basketball players who net 100-500mn throughout their entire career usually go broke after basketball cause they are still stuck in their fiat mentality. 
People who build wealth, usually stop spending as much once they hit green profits. It's better to save for the future than impulsively spend today.
People don't know how to use money...that's the bottom line.

There are no fraud proofs so SPV nodes have no way of flagging an invalid block and rejecting it. Bitcoin's antifragile nature is that if every validating node is running the same consensus rules, if the miners disobey those rules, a supermajority of those nodes will "orphan/reject" the block and continue to listen for a block from an honest miner to add to the chain.
With true SPV fraud proofs, an SPV node could listen for blocks (without a blockchain) and reject a block if it were invalid. There is a subset of these proofs people have been working on but not the ones I think were envisioned based on the vision of the whitepaper.

Remittances work on the notion of crediting money to a family which serves as an organization. It doesn't matter how often they receive the money as long as it is in a surplus to their average financial fees. The source here are the first people willing to pay the fee. In this case if you are living in an impoverished state and only need say 10k USD a year to survive, if your relatives wire you $2500 in Bitcoin per quarter that's 4 transactions. If you credit only what your family needs monthly to purchase food from Amazon pantry, that's at most 12 transactions a year. Maybe 14. People who actually live on Bitcoin tend to have significantly better money organization than their "normie peers".


1) Bitcoin has never had a hard fork before, every major bug was fixed with a softfork. Every chain split was caused by a softfork. I really wonder what the fiasco would be trying to deploy a hard fork in the same manner...probably a disaster.
2) Blockchain size increases fast enough as it is, making it nearly impossible for old CPUs to validate a block chain effectively without libsecp256k1 (which I don't trust since tinyECC does the same shit a 1/8th the size, so something is going on there that feels "out of place"). So even if someone gives you a copy of the blockchain free of charge, on a free new SSD hard drive. If your CPU sucks it will take almost a month maybe more to validate it (without libsecp256k1), and create its own UTXO set and an index of watched addresses.
Additionally if you want to "sweep a private key", or watch an address you have to be looking for them when you're reindexing or else you'll have to start from the beginning.
3) Moving full nodes to datacenters before full SPV fraud proofs exists prevents SPV nodes from voting on the network. An SPV node at this point can only announce a transaction and ask a server if that transaction has confirmed. It can't vote on the network by rejecting a relayed block. If you have enough people give up this power, the remaining few are easier to control How much easier would it be to get BU implemented if you only had to upgrade 6 nodes on the network and you knew those 6 people and controlled them?
Meanwhile the only beneficial reason for having bigger blocks is to mitigate traffic congestion. But from a traffic engineers standpoint induced demand is a double edged sword when increasing roads. Adding cars to the road makes traffic worse. Putting people on more efficient transit is what clears the roads.


Except not. IIRC Hal Finney was the "OG small blocker". Luke-JR as long as I've been acquainted with him, has had a personal war on spam. Several people I asked as a n00b when inquiring about transaction fees was, "at some point you'll have to bid for a miner to accept the transaction".


Luke-JR has tried several times to present a hard fork to every sub community on IRC, and is usually kicked out by at least one of them who would be able to veto a change with their cryptowealth (similar to how Ver is doing with SegWit), thus he's stated several times "the community does not have consensus" meaning he doesn't think its viable to go up against whales who vehemently don't want a hard fork.


You're opining on things you clearly don't understand. Instead of saying, "Hey I'm not the best at this or an expert, but this is my opinion take it as it is." You're saying things like "Most users think a filled mem pool and a 40x increase in tx fees in a year is a problem. If you want to characterize this as "not broken" then I think you're out of your mind."
Which is something you don't have the comprehension yet to opine on. You know what a blocksize increase does to the mempool? It writes it to the blockchain. Most will opine "Well disk space is less expensive than bandwidth or memory!!!" And will scream "MOORE'S LAW!!!!!" when it comes to CPU speed.
You know what happens when a large mempool is written to the blockchain with a larger blocksize limit? It means everyone has to verify just that much more data. Data verification isn't cheap regardless of how you want to opine.
Thus you have two choices in terms of increasing blocksize: keep it small and have better mempool jettisoning, or increase the blocksize and make verification take longer to reduce transaction load.
Your opinion may lean to the latter, but long term its a terrible solution that will disenfranchise older CPUs in a time when Moore's Law is at the brink.
All and all. r/btc exists because a bunch of butthurt people didn't get rich quick on the first bubble and were promised "mass adoption" which to them == get rich quick. r/btc is full of people who would rather complain on reddit like you and I am now, thinking its actual work rather than what it is.

But I applaud your anti-socialist message, although it falls on deaf ears. To be successful in Bitcoin you have to just be a better human than what the fiat world finds satisfactory.

Hell you may trust them enough to give them $150 of Bitcoin early in the month to prepay for all your coffee cause you just love the shop so much and you guys trust each other.

It reminds me of the Matrix when The Architect describes his failings. Eventually he states a more intuitive program discovered the solution (The Oracle), giving people a choice, even if that choice was just another illusion in Plato's Cave, allowed people to accept their reality.
Very few had a vocal opinion on the block size until Gavin publicized his roadmap in late 2014. Until 2014 it was really just a thing a few people talked about until it became a global political debate.

You don't know how to respond because the critical nature of what is at war with Bitcoin is beyond your means to combat.


If your needs affect the global economy, because you are inconvenienced then no, people dying because the assert their freedom definitely means you can't have what you want, no matter how much you want it.






The reason you can't respond is because you have yet to truly experience actual hardship. If hardship for you is the inability to walk into Starbucks, scan a QR code of NFC chip, and walk out with coffee in a timely manner using Bitcoin, your priorities are really fucked up. I'm not trying to be insulting but this is the same notion of how SJW think they are helping starving Africans by posting on Tumblr.
The more likely scenario is your salary is deposited into a single address and takes several days to clear, just as it does now with banks. Except you will control the address, it will be immune to seizure, and you will be able to save for your offspring who hopefully try to improve on your legacy (whatever that may be).

Bitcoin respects the finite nature of economic realities. 1 Bitcoin today will be 1 Bitcoin in 100 years, and so on.. Whereas the US dollar I'm holding is constantly inflated.
Gold was the perfect money until governments found a way to put lead in gold bars.
Printed money always sucked, because people printed more of it. They didn't respect value, and want subsidies to just magically appear, which doesn't respect the finite nature of reality.
If money have never evolved beyond gold coins we'd probably be better off economically (particularly if government didn't take an active effort in replacing gold coins with lead ones spray painted gold), because the money supply would reflect economic reality.
The existence of Bitcoin solves this dilemma, although I'm sure the government in someway is trying to find a way of replacing Bitcoin bars with lead ones.

Inevitably people will just route around Coinbase and buy BTC on the street.

Right and wrong are just words, which I misused I apologize. 
I feel like people are cutting GLBSE's operations too much slack (both Theymos and Nefario). Sure you shouldn't have to "go underground" to start a business, but anarcho-capitalists aren't very well accepted by the upper echelon, (See: Murray Rothbard), so why would this be any exception?
It is sort of a good thing GLBSE did get shutdown in the end due to the amount of bogus assets listed, but an anarcho-capitalist society (like the Bitcoin community) shouldn't depend on state regulation to enforce their rules.
You can't operate without regulations, then call for big brother when you get scammed. That's like retroactively buying fire insurance and expecting them to pay a claim on your $1M house, because you accidentally fell asleep with the stove on one night.

You're both wrong unfortunately...one country != Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a currency of dissidence by nature due to the fact no one country can regulate it. One country views the ecurrency as "real money" another views it as "toy money". There will never be a 100% global consensus, so there will always be a bastion for bitcoin users to exist in an unregulated (I prefer the term "self-regulating") state.
Nefario's betrayal and disloyalty to his shareholders was due to a lack of contingency and legal planning, which shows in the stupidity of the way he shutdown the exchange. i.e. the logs.
No one seems to bring up these same arguments 


when talking about MPEX's operations. Just unsubstantiated claims against them. (Romanian lawyers apparently view Bitcoin in the same light as money from an MMORPG).

Great question. Thanks for asking.
Coinbase dumps all their KYC data that links to Bitcoin address to a database. This is how products like chainalysis work their magic. Buying from Coinbase automatically links addresses to your real world identity (i.e. not anonymous), and any addresses you interact with become part of that graph even if those addresses are "unknown" in terms of their links to identities. 
Coinbase acts as a spook to deanonymize the network, while secretly feeding that information to law enforcement. If you're suspected of committing any crime of interest, regardless if you actually did anything, you'll go from being a passive target to an active target.
The fact anyone who is a Bitcoin user is comfortable with this notion is extremely unnerving.
In short, any Bitcoin moving through Coinbase gets tracked and placed into a "deanonymizing" graph, thus anyone interacting with that graph indirectly becomes "a target".

cryptoXchange recently disabled MtGox coupon withdrawals, and bitinstant code withdrawals, making it damn near impossible to take out fiat without using:
1. International Wire Transfer
2. Local AUD Bank Transfer
Given there isn't enough liquidity or volume to warrant the 15 dollar withdraw fee for a wire transfer, your fiat is essentially "locked" inside of crpytox.
Take a look at the ever declining volume of trades.


I call bullshit on the market manipulation. campBX has the same average trade volumes but isn't as terrible as the piece of shit crypto has become. 
Their customer support is terrible. They have constant liquidity issues. And now they've essentially locked out the withdrawal of fiat to non Australians.
I hope this is a death throe, the BTC world would be far better without crypto.
(Also as a side note, they were accused of scamming a customer, which can be referenced in the bitcointalk forums)

UGH. What you may not realize is if I transact with someone who uses Coinbase, I am tainted by their surveillance program. Example someone buys BTC from Coinbase, then transacts with me. I then use the BTC for gambling, or other "blacklisted reasons", and in consequence the Coinbase user is banned, and I am now a target regardless if I personally was deanonymized or not, just for interacting with a Coinbase user.
I know this, because Coinbase uses a product like Chainalysis, which aims to create a massive database linking KYC information to bitcoin addresses.
I can't respect a company that is clearly not in the best interest of the community. As I said, in order for evil to perpetuate, it requires good men to do nothing. The least I can do is make everyone aware of the bullshit and get as many people to not use Coinbase as possible.

KYC/AML are specifically made to deanonymize and limit privacy of Bitcoin users since it can't be enforced at the protocol level. There is no compromising with the USG when it comes to BSA, so the only solution is to not use them.

He can't avoid legal hell, he's likely already neck deep in shit. By transferring Bitcoin equities into USD, he's opened the door for US regulation, (any income made must be taxed).
He's clearly stated (on the record), that he exchanged BTC into USD. He was issuing bonds, or in the eyes of the IRS an income stream. This means he was somehow making income off the investment. If any of that income was converted into USD, it's eligible to be taxed, (as long as it is above a certain amount per fiscal year, and given the investment totals to 1.5M, I'm sure the income made from it exceeds the minimum amount to be taxed). 
In my opinion, this guy is trying to resolve the tax issues, before paying back the investors. If he isn't able to pay the taxes, he is facing some federal prison time. 
Shit is getting, real.

80 Million in VC funding AND NOT PROFITABLE. There are other significant Bitcoin businesses that aren't bound by regulation that are highly more profitable, and ironically (to lawmakers or maybe not), are more trustworthy. It's an exercise for you the reader to find these businesses.
It isn't hate I feel, it's immense distrust to the point I perceive Coinbase as a scam. You keep apologizing for their privacy rape simply because you still believe in the "too big too fail" mentality. The $80mn in funding means nothing if you use it merely for show: hiring hundreds of useless college dropouts parading as engineers, using KNOWN scammer [Zenefits]( for employee benefits, wasting money on projects that are terrible written (Toshi), and actively attacking the privacy of the network makes for a FUCKING SCAM.

There was a post earlier about setting up a commodities market.
The way I see it, is if there was a union of farms, or even a few farms that offered their commodities for bitcoins (like wheat or corn), then an exchange would be willing to write contracts for those commodities at agreed upon quantity&amp;quality. 
Physical delivery becomes the main issue, but is not an impossible obstacle to overcome.
The idea is as this market grows, more and more farms/producers would be able to sell via a BTC based commodities rather than traditional ones, which opens up a whole new ball game.
Since BTC is so easy to transfer globally vs "digital fiat" I see no reason why a farmer on one continent wouldn't be glad to sell a portion of a harvest to someone on another continent for BTC. The buyer if he is looking for procurement, would likely have network for distribution, and the cycle continues.

The reality is that chainalysis keeps blacklist database of fuzzed identities. If you get banned from one exchange or device  that uses chainalysis as a compliance tool you will be banned from all of them. The ones I know of are that utilize this are Bitpay, Coinbase, and Gemini.
Although they might deny it, I believe their vision is to prove Bitcoin is changeable to appease regulators. If LocalBitcoins is removed from the scene, you have to use a KYC procurement method. And it wouldnt be long before Bitpay denies payments coming from addresses they "don't trust" via chainalysis. If this is provable Gemini may be able to list their precious ETF. It all seems a ploy for basically a Wall Street takeover.

Given 30% of the hash power is already defecting, it will probably be Antpool vs The World. 
Also not to mention if exchanges don't honor 2x, (as LocalBitcoins probably won't), you will have a situation where people lose money by accidentally cross swapping chains, or companies freezing business until one chain wins. It's really a TBD. But given people are publicly withdrawing there are probably some businesses that are freaking out a little bit at the potential gargantuan SFYL.

You don't seem very technical, and also a little over zealous in your assumptions.
You must 1) acknowledge the contention. If you discount serious dissent when going forward with a hardfork (which you are doing), you become blind to the potential attacks therein. 
2) The attacks themselves will cause unprecedented SFYL. Imagine Coinbase and Bitpay honor 2x as the chain to check for payments, but other entities do not? What happens when someone with a GreenAddress wallet sends payment to a merchant using Bitpay? Will Bitpay have to actively say which wallets will support their platform?
Will Bitpay be restricted to using only exchanges that support 2x given no exchange has stated they are supporting one chain? Will Bitpay merchants still get their money on time will it cause a liquidity crisis?
Will all payments have to freeze until one chain emerges (what if this takes several days?)
You can hardfork if you want, but don't hardfork without understanding the consequences or being prepared for them. VC fueled companies have always been under the mentality of "move quick and break things", but that hasn't worked well historically for Bitcoin companies handling a large some of money.

The big difference is the ETH, hard forked to roll back a smart contract since the original soft fork to freeze the funds failed.
Bitcoin didn't hard fork. Satoshi released a patch and told everyone who was mining to mine a new chain until it had the most proof of work. This was done with a soft fork.

This isn't a tinfoil hat issue. It's a real issue that will destroy fungibility of coins. 
Should I be blacklisted just because I have coins that at one point were part of "prohibited use" even if I don't know it?

Yup, we reproduced the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus in AP Physics. I say ALMOST trivial, not trivial. It takes work, a lot of people fucked up the experiment for one reason or another.
I was referring to deriving c from the Lorentz transformation as described in Einstein's *Relativity* when you solve for c at very high speeds for v. The first time I did it was very empowering, and this was before AP Physics mind you.

I did. In high school, after my dad bought me a copy of relativity for Christmas one year. It only requires a 10th grade education to derive, no Calculus required! The barrier to the calculation isn't unfathomable, I didn't require a supercomputer and 3 months in order to come to this solution. It's easily verifiable and almost trivial to calculate the c in E=mc^2.

I'm sorry to say this, but...you're fucking retarded if you haven't researched these points.
1. Threats 1-2 Finding a bitcoin address that is linked to a person and tracing it via block exploration is NOT HELPFUL. Only dumbasses treat a single bitcoin address like a bank account. The official bitcoin client states when generating an address, "Here is your address book. You should generate a new address for every transaction." If you're succumbing to "human nature" you're succumbing to utter stupidity and deserve to be fucking robbed. Take more effort in maintaining anonymity on the bitcoin network. Shuffling coins between hundreds of address tends to do the trick. If the mafia can launder mass amounts of currency through this network, without it being stolen by some super elite hackers, or even detected, then the network is anonymous to me. 
2. Reversing the IRC Bootstrapping by decoding others IP's can be avoided if you use fucking TOR. Holy fucking shit, just use TOR and shut the fuck up please.
3. Threat 4 is just dumb. I'm sorry, but you could say this about any software that connects to the internet and has some private file. Hey I use SSH on port 22, you think you can steal my private keys? No! Because you need a private key to get into my machine anyways.
The pattern I see above is bitcoin theft will occur primarily through human stupidity, or moreover, feeling one is secure when they really aren't. Bitcoin won't protect you against traditional attacks, you need to have firewalls, up to date OS patches, and general malware protection, or you're going to get fucked one of these days. 
Bitcoin is open source. Open source is primarily about educating yourself. You wouldn't commit to a multi-million dollar investment into a venture you didn't fully understand would you? 
The thing that pisses me off the most is this guy had to pull up the "ponzi scheme" argument. 
Running a ponzi scheme using the bitcoin protocol would require more processing power than is available to most supercomputing facilities. The longest block chain that has been accepted by the network can only be regenerated to add new blocks IF and ONLY IF you redo the proof of work from the begginning with the Genesis block. How the fuck would you make a Ponzi Scheme without having more computing power available to you than is contributing to the network. Only Batman himself would be able to generate a completely new fake block chain more quickly than bitcoin network.

That's why users need to educate themselves rather than whine after they've lost half a million due to something preventable, (like a trojan, or worm).

* "Maintain a strong password" 
* "Use different passwords for different accounts"
* "Change heavily used account passwords often"
* "Keep your virus protection up to date"
* "Keep your operating system up to date"
These should be fundamentals for dealing with trust relationship on the net in general.
When you add anonymity into the mix, you have to maintain even higher and more paranoid standards. I really feel people should read the introduction to bitcoin and "safety guidelines" on their forum before another theft occurs of such magnitude. 
I'm only pissed because it feels like the bitcoin developers worked very hard to make bitcoin open and transparent as well as secure, in terms of a protocol. People should spend more time designing a better client and implementing it, rather than complaining about the faults of a client that is extremely open. 
At some point consumers need to take responsibility for their own education, rather than desperately trusting someone else for that purpose.

No it's not. You sound like a really uninformed user of any payment network. The transaction is not immediate only the authorization of the transfer of funds. Only relatively recently with the push of online and mobile banking do payment processors offer the option to adjust the available balance of the issuer account. When payment cards first appeared you had to keep a ledger of your transactions to make sure the reconciliation of the authorization and settlement matched. Banks still recommend you do this. The consumer has perverted this process.
Even now it's best to wait up to 6 confirmations (or more) to make sure a transaction is verified due to orphans etc which can take up to an hour. 
You obviously have 0 to no knowledge of the payment industry so really I don't think your opinion matters or really provides any benefits.

Rapid growth isn't sustainable. The problem with too much money is 100x more deadly in Bitcoin. Bitpay's original burn rate last year this put them on par with 8-12 months of money left.

@_date: 2015-11-30 21:44:36
I understand what you're trying to do. However the Bitcoin payment network has always been "crippled" or inefficient. Bitcoin as a payment network cannot scale to absurd levels of throughput seen with Paypal, VISA, et. al. on its own accord without sacrifice of resources in an inefficient manner.
If VISA, Paypal, et. al had to settle transactions as well as shuttle them, sure I'd see your point. 
Bitcoin's payment network is extremely inefficient, which is my point, thus trying to pervert it with more throughput directly will never allow for it scale to payment processor/network levels. It will cost significantly more resources to match these levels...
@_date: 2015-11-30 15:06:55
Bitpay has a good heart. But is a terribly managed company. They spent way too much money with very little returns. For instance their invoicing system doesn't utilize proper accounting reconciliation, so merchants liquidating into fiat, sometimes don't know if they've been paid or not. In these cases the merchant has to reach out to Bitpay support (which was always understaffed in comparison to marketing and events), to find out if the liquidation is on the books.
Not too mention further wasted money on the catered lunches for EVERY employee, sponsoring a college bowl game they honestly couldn't afford, and providing free services without any source of revenue.
No matter how you try to spin this Mr. Spindoctor, it's not a sane business management. The company deserves to die, or at least the brain needs to be replaced with one that didn't come from an asylum.
The actual value this company has thus far brought to Bitcoin is negligible. Not nearly worth the money VC's have dumped into it.

Content is monetized through ad revenue or subscriptions. That is you pay for consuming the content either by viewing advertisements (i.e. ads in a free newspaper or on various websites) or you directly pay for consumption (i.e. Netflix, buying a dvd, WSJ paywall, etc.). 
How does this relate to STEEM? We'll get their, but first a history lesson.
In 2009 Wired published [this article]( in its magazine. I remember reading this article in a lab just trying to pass some time, but it always stuck with me. Lets see some key points:


This was in 2009, and Facebook was having trouble monetizing its infant ad network. This contention actually led to Google to personalize its users metrics even more - the competition has led to a  platform one can launch targeted ad campaigns never seen before. 
But this means Facebook was dependent on external funding (VC capital) to stay afloat while it figured itself out. STEEM is attempting the same strategy by bootstrapping off of Bitcoin capital. Note 98% of all STEEM volume is priced in Bitcoin. Since STEEM doesn't directly pay for content (you don't buy STEEM to consume content, although buying STEEM inevitably pays the content creators; you buy STEEM to curate content), all revenue for investors will need to come from some sort of marketing/ad revenue - there needs to be value returned for investing in STEEM.
The article goes on to show why Facebook had such troubles in 2009 trying to get profitability from its ad networks:


Google opened the door for targeted marketing. A few months after I read this article for the first time, I watched a documentary where a couple who owned a struggling small business invested in a targeted ad campaign. As a business owner, if your product is sound, and your business is operating properly, but your market is underserved (thus lack of sales), targeted marketing allows you to discover new customers who are looking for your product but just don't know about you yet. This was the case for the struggling business in the documentary. The business owner set up a Google ad campaign to target users who wanted their product, and sales immediately increased.
However this doesn't help businesses establish brand identity, which is just as important as customer discovery.


Youtube cracked this first, shortly followed by Facebook Business Pages. This is what large companies care about the most in terms of marketing, (particularly in the States). Like Mad Men, ad executives in charge of branding are trying to maintain brand awareness. 
Okay. So keep this in mind for a second.


That's not really ethical marketing. You're taking a reviewer with integrity and paying them for positive reviews. If the positive review doesn't match with the actual quality of the product, this is essentially false advertising, and burns the reputation of the reviewer. Pretty scandalous.
In the example above WB was doing promotional material using PewDiePie as an icon. WB is EXTREMELY good at the ad game, to the point I don't think they care too much about the actual quality of their product. For instance, the movie Man of Steel, was paid for through promotional branding throughout the film, before it was even released in theaters. But in this case you are selling space for brand awareness, not targeted advertising.


In the ideal scenario 500 million pairs of eyeballs view Steemit regularly, and promoting content on Steemit runs similarly to Facebook. Businesses pay to put pages up for their businesses, then buy Steem power to promote it to the top page. But in this case, why do you need payouts? 


Okay. So brand advertising is used to promote brand awareness rather than a direct ROI resulting from the campaign. This can only be done when you have a ridiculous market share with your product, like Coca-Cola, or Disney. This gets into market mechanics that Steemit will need years to develop. Facebook had over 500mn registered users before the first branded advertisements started showing up. 


Yup, same concept.
It seem you believe in the concept of STEEM, and that's fine, I just  think its inadvertently become a Ponzi in its current form.

The attacker would be smart and likely short Bitcoin to excessively low prices during the chaos of the attack. He could make triple what he would spend on the attack...especially if he had it well planned.
This probably wouldn't kill Bitcoin, but would devalue it significantly while a few people exit with large sums by betting on its destruction.
@_date: 2016-07-22 21:16:56


I know it's a silly phrase but that is the point. 
Basically something that sets out to be an actual economic system ends up turning into a game of musical chairs. That is small fish trade at nominally high prices without much bid depth, so basically only a few people can exit at once at the advertised prices.
Bitcoin markets occasionally, but rarely now experience this problem. The article makes note of a few examples. Bitcoin capital has proven to be sound so trading has become more pragmatic. Recall times Bitcoin volatility was at all time lows for record durations - you can see here Bitcoin has a good foundation.
Steemit content creators require Bitcoin investors in order to liquidate their proceeds., however the content itself cannot directly be monetized (yet). The promises of TV shows being exclusive to Steemit are far off, so what exactly will a Bitcoin investor get in return for investing in STEEM? What has resulted is a game of musical chairs like the notorious Bitcoin Gem. Those who exit first get paid at the expense of those who exit late...
I don't think any of these people sought out to create a game of musical chairs very similar to a Ponzi, but due to lack of education this is the exact situation we are faced with. Someone is going to end up a bag holder at this point. 
Also note this could be solved with short selling solutions. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 20:44:39


I can't say that for certain as I wasn't a Facebook insider during its inception. From the reports I read in *The Accidental Billionaires* Sean Parker was very much against ad revenue, up until he was forced out of his leadership role. I think Justin Timberlake also has a line about this in "The Social Network" - "When you install ads, it's not longer cool."
When Facebook IPO'ed the price didn't return to this valuation until it started making acquisitions with it's cash on hand, and increasing it's ad revenue. Facebook was a borderline bubble, and I have a 2011 Fortune magazine that showed metrics of Facebook's valuation to revenue statistics were x5-x10 greater to that of company's during the dotcom bubble. The point I was making here was that Facebook was unable to monetize the content itself, it had to monetize the users.


Mircea Popescu is a board member for Qntra, and honestly I have no idea why he published the article there instead of on his personal blog. Barring this incident, Qntra is the only news site I've known to be brutally aggressive in attacking scams promoted elsewhere.
Personally I believe if the Bitbet fiasco had been resolved, instead of it going into receivership, and sold at a fraction of its valuation, the mining konspirici accusations would have been more thoroughly investigated, as there a natural growing cartel in mining revolving around chip manufacturers. The nature of the ASIC miner production and market mechanics, has created an entry cliff into mining. I don't think this is merely coincidence.


But if the content itself is not monetized, what use is it for it become visible? For a display adwords campaign you make bids on the PPC value, for the venue slot and are charged based on impressions and amount of legit clicks on the ad. People who fully convert on an ad are linked to real revenue. For instance someone clicks on an ad for shoes, buys those shoes via that ad campaign, the revenue associated with that sale is linked to that campaign. So you can see how much revenue a particular campaign generates for your product. 
Straight from the Google Support docs:


Steemit has none of this in place.


Those blogs have metrics attached to them to calculate the ROI of a campaign.


Bitcoin has a lot more depth than STEEM. STEEM has maybe $500,000 in total market bids across all exchanges, Bitcoin has $11381863.6922 of bid depth before the price gets cut in half on just Bitfinex.
Bitcoin is also a good capital allocator, STEEM I dunno. I guess basically it reminds me of 2013 when people were trading above $180 on shallow depth in Bitcoin inadvertently creating a bubble.

This is yet to be seen. When embedded child porn, terrorism manuals, or undesirable leaks start showing up on the Steem blockchain, pressure will be on the Steemit leadership to force a hardfork to remove it.
Depending on whether or not this happens, will determine whether that postulate holds true in the future.
People navigate toward the path of least resistance. That's why Steemit advertises inflated prices based on shallow market depth, it's "easy money". I respect the inspiration it's instilling in people, but that's just because it promises riches.

I'm not talking about high returns on investment, I'm talking about inability to exit the market cleanly without creating any volatility in the underlying market. Ponzi's arise when speculators go from making the market efficient to playing musical chairs on shallow bids. If everyone exited with their liquid payouts at the same time the STEEM price would crash.




STEEM doesn't provide any utility. In fact in the "STEEM will allow for sovereignty article" they were talking about using SBD as a currency which seems ludicrous due to the fact the market is entirely supported by Bitcoin. The only reason to own STEEM tokens is either exit for STEEM or "donate to content".


This is how valuations become nominal and not realistic. Facebook wasn't very profitable until after it started stealing the ad network market space from Google with targeted advertisements. Twitter lagged behind on this, and as such its bubble popped. Social networks are only as valuable as the ROI on their marketing, and even then the conversion rate is horrendously low.
I mean take a look at reddit. It still isn't monetized to profitable levels. They raised VC capital in the past 3 years, and are still limping toward someway to make the business profitable.
Nearly every media site generates revenue through selling ad-space or using a paywall. (I.e. its paid for with commercials or a subscription of some sort). Steemit doesn't facilitate this. It's purely funded with the esteem of the mob, and the money supply is given value by Bitcoin investors. There is no business model here...




I don't think you're looking at what would occur if everyone tried to exit. The economy is currently based on musical chairs. People create content and sell out to bitcoin investors. Whereas Bitcoin has both a shadow and surface economy, exchanged for the procurement of goods. Because Bitcoin has an actual economy, STEEM is using bitcoin as its actual monetary based. (Bitcoin bids for STEEM is technically what gives it its value).
STEEM will not incentivize undiscovered content creators, to create the next 5-star Netflix TV show. Given the production costs of professional content, and the fact people have to eat, it's more valuable for a professional content creator to go through traditional channels than to try and monetize through Steemit. 


My involvement with Qntra is strictly due to disclosing scams in the Bitcoin space. This is ultimately why Qntra started, as an antithesis to when cyrptocoin news sites were actively pumping scams. 
The difference between Qntra and STEEM is clear. Qntra shareholders get paid if Qntra is ever sold as a whole. Qntra shareholders are also entitled to ownership of any profit or revenue the company generates. 
STEEM users will never be entitled to any proceeds from created content. It's all funded through altruism.
Tell me why a professional TV producer would rather create a STEEMIT exclusive vs. selling the pilot to any other number of services that have a revenue?

I'm the OP. And I've read it pretty thoroughly. It has some good concepts in the ideal sense, I just think reality and idealism never mix well.

Dude, how fucking dumb are you? Probably dumb enough to the point you didn't even read the blog post, before making your own unintelligible rant. I'm so sure of it, I'm willing to make a BitBet on that one.
Your argument devolves to name calling, the least intelligent form of debating, likely because you lack the mental capacity to educate yourself, and put forth an intelligent argument. Rather you believe the hype, and think with the sheep. As to quote Flava Flav of Public Enemy: "Don't, don't, don't believe the hype." You're an idiot not because you don't agree with Mircea's views, but because you're too dumb to educate yourself to make a valid judgement. Your mind is closed and you'd rather judge based on tertiary sources rather than putting in a little effort, and finding out for yourself. As for name calling: You're one of those fucks who likely doesn't read the manual, yet is the first person to raise his hand and ask a question the manual answers within its pages.
The more I read posts like this the more empathetic I am to Mircea's viewpoint of, "don't waste resources on the ignorant." And as well the frightening realization of the inevitability of the Bitcoin community devolving into an infinite September.
First off hate speech looks something like: "God hates fags". And is deliberate in spreading a hateful message. Mircea's post however illustrates a point, developed through intuition, that is very aware of the condition the "black community" faces, particularly in America.


This quote clearly illustrates this is not about race but about community and culture. Dave Chappelle stated on his show, "We are all part of the same human family. Our differences are only cultural. That's it." 
This gives rise to the issue of what American's particularly young African American's relate to "black culture", via what is propagated through the "black media", such as hip-hop culture. This brings to the table an entire maelstrom of issues that Mircea's post alludes to, through INTUITION, I might add, that he himself has not likely physically observed due to his geographical location being Romania, but understands due to the aggressiveness of how the American media portrays this culture. 
How many hip-hop songs have you heard about "hoes in different area-codes", promoting violence, and extreme drug use?
How many stories have you head of hip-hop artists, and sports stars that earn 7 figure salaries, end up in financial ruin?
How often have you heard of children growing up in environments with no educational resources in, an INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY, falling victim to gang violence, and/or becoming a prison-based statistic?
Mircea's observation of dangers of children being raised by TV was even used as satire by The Boondocks, in their portrayal of BET. (There is an episode where one of the characters watches nothing BET for 168 hours straight. His health begins to deteriorate and by the end of the episode, his IQ has visibly dropped more than a few points). Shortly after this satire became mainstream, BET rapidly changed their image, and content, and continue to do so.
These are ALL very REAL issues, that plague my (I being black), community. And before you downvote me into oblivion because I am willing to speak out against your bullshit, throughout my years I have donated my time to try and educate children in communities with no educational resources in an attempt to save even one child from the horrors of having to "run the streets". These are issues you haven't even brought up, and when they are brought up, you ignore them, and continue to state like an automaton: "Mircea is a racist who used the word nigger." Yet, you are likely completely okay with a black person using the phrase "mah nigga", no problem. Hypocrisy much?
In the immortal words of Paul Mooney: "Everybody wanna be a nigga, but nobody wanna be a nigga." Seriously...think about that for a moment. 
MPOE-PR an employee of Mircea once posted on the forums:
The same ignorance I'm constantly seeing generated in the Bitcoin community, is the exact same ignorance that plagues my community. 
To quote MPOE-PR directly:


This is you right now. You are being as lazy as an American. You see the word "nigger" and you claim racism, but have no idea the hurdles a young black man must go through, particularly one born impoverished. Again how fucking dumb are you?
Mircea isn't what is wrong with the world. The world needs less people like you. People that not only don't understand the issues, but are unwilling to educate themselves, before making any judgement.
Yet MPEX, has never gotten, hacked, while countless businesses have fallen to the Bitcoin graveyard. No one cares.
Yet MP is in IRC at least once a day to directly address issues, and answer questions. No one cares.
Yet MP takes the time [to warn of us our own ignorance]( No one listens.
Yet MP again [warns us of the dangers of the ignorant media]( No one listens.
Yet MPEX is the only place to **reliably** provide REAL option hedges, via MPOE-bot, unlike that ICBIT bucket-shop. No one cares.
The list goes on and on, however, "MP is a racist, don't do business with him," is your fucking argument? Out of all the fucking scams and inept decisions that have perpetrated within the Bitcoin-sphere from Pirate to GLBSE, this "boycott" is your *glorious* contribution to the Bitcoin community?
Even though Popescu doesn't invite me to his secret conspiracy dinners, he's still mah nigga.

How do you feel about the state of the Bitcoin community after the collapse of GLBSE?

Shipping would be the key factor in this scenario. If in this hypothetical world an international shipping company exists that takes BTC this is highly feasible. 
Even without an internet connection, the exporters could receive coin in the form of paper wallets. If they have cellphones, coinapult would serve their needs in spending the coins.
