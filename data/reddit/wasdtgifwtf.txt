In an ideal scenario when everything else crashes, everyone will throw thier money into bitcoin for store of value. But sadly during crisis, everyone still needs to eat, pay rent and take transports, thus they will pull money out from all investments including bitcoin to fund themselves. Largest factor is still human behavior at the end of the day.

It was above $5k for 2 hours until awhile ago

Its not dead, it just had a year long correction from the previous artificially high price caused by the introduction of USDT. Based on the chart on CoinGecko, Bitcoin price today at $4,700 is still 8x to 10x of what it was 5 years ago! Which market in this world would you be able to find such return and still say that it is dead?!

are you running your own lightning node?
@_date: 2019-01-22 06:41:22
Sounds like bad news to me, they would just make this crypto space more centralized
@_date: 2019-01-23 03:44:45
Not even Petro is helping.
@_date: 2019-01-31 06:45:45
If you run the full node then you will know
