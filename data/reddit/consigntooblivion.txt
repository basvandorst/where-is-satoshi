That... is the million bitcoin question.

I bet this guy's inbox is blowing up with people begging for Bitcoin. A shame it was ruined soo fast. A crazy generous thing to do - maybe this will increase the publicity for Bitcoin a tiny bit though - so still a good thing for everybody interested in Bitcoin?

It's all about if/when BFL ship. They have dozens of missed promises at this stage - but apparently they are going to start shipping real soon now, for real, this time, maybe.
It's the 1 million bitcoin question at the moment.
Edit: Oh, and the other important question is how much the difficulty will have gone up if/when you finally get your BFL device. There are a LOT of preorders ahead of you in line at BFL as well as (at least) a couple more Avalon batches  as well as ASICMINER bringing something many TH/s on line shortly. So the difficulty might be up 10-100x before you get your BFL.

Everybody is kicking themselves. Must remember hindsight is 20/20 etc to maintain sanity.

Me too.. I found out about Bitcoin when it was nearly hitting $100 - it took me a little while to understand what is going on. I (like everybody) wish I got in a bit sooner - but oh well, hindsight is 20/20.

Let's see how crazy the price gets this time!
