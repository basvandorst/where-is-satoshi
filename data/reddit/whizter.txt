Here's what I am doing to handle my BTC:
I got a blockchain.info wallet secured by double encryption and TOTP (there's a plugin for keepass which is google auth compatible). The encrypted backup is automatically saved from there to my dropbox. In case blockchain.info fails I got a backup of all private keys inside keepass with a secure password. I also use keepass to login to all of the sites, not storing the passwords in browser. The encrypted keepass password db (where I store all of my passwords) is also automatically saved to dropbox (check addon KPDataSave), and I copy it once per week to an USB drive via robocopy batch. I do all of this because once I lost my password db and had to restore most of my passwords, and that's quite alot. 
The biggest issue would be a trojan with keylogger also stealing my password db (the .kdbx file).

Hey, some days ago I created a similar system, but a little bit simpler and without inventory control. You have a commandline and initiate payments with "pos x currency", then a QR-code pops up that you could move to a second screen faced to the customer. As soon as a payment is received the popup disappears and you get notified that payment is complete. It accepts every currency code that the google api knows and ofcourse btc. Here's a video I created which demonstrates how easy and fast it is to accept 0 confirmation payments:

Thanks, I really like the idea of this pool, I didn't know something like this existed. Makes mining with GPUs reasonable again.
