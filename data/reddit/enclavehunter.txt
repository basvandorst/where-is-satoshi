Surely they all do
@_date: 2019-08-05 04:56:07
50 here. Fucking crazy how it works. I'll hold tho
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:58:47
Does coinbase run this risk as well?
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:45:53
I just want a jeep tbh

I believe a whale simply sold a huge chunk and stop loss orders kept the sell train going
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:05:17
No I'm stupid. O meant I bought $75 worth of it
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:37:49
You wish. Its 2k for the nurse, 9k for the technician, 12k for the doctor, and 3k for the hospital.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:44:53
Almost panic sold during the coinbase slowdown.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:52:01
20k milestone then to the moon
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:21:34
Is it? I'm happy with a used one. Lots of muddy roads here in texas and my car gets stuck all the time. Plus I like the idea of driving one. Heading to the oil and gas industry and I would hate driving my current car to those jobs
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:18:41
I dont. If I paid insurance I wouldn't afford anything else lol. Going into o&amp;g industry. Lol I dont wanna have some accident I'll limp away from.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:42:36
This. Bought 75 at 6k. Now bought 72 at 13k
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:20:19
Oh I want a used jeep. Just something for when I want to drive on dirt
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:19:57
I got my regular car for long rides. I do want a jeep or comparable offroad vehicle with that shape
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:51:58
I'm just here for a jeep
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:22:20
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:17:44
That's why I'm unsure whether to sell all my $120 that I bought at 75 or selling part since theres a chance the next low will be higher than when I bought in
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:17:48
Cries in freedom$$$$
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:15:32
Same but only $75
Could have put in my 5k
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:02:35
It's a debt that isnt even on record anymore. It's just the school keeping me from my transcript. I'm getting into the o&amp;g field and most likely going to college after a year for a degree in that
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:30:43
Look up oil rig hand no experience. You'll find openings. I'm currently waiting for my background check to arrive
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:41:09

@_date: 2019-06-26 22:50:34

@_date: 2019-06-27 14:29:53
McAfee confirmed
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:53:48
Fuck paying my college debt. I was saving up 3k to pay off my 6k debt to continue college. All my graduated friends cant even find good jobs rn. May just invest
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:15:20

@_date: 2019-06-27 21:16:51

@_date: 2019-06-26 18:05:00
