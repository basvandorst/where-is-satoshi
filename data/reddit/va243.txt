Just separate them as 2 lines/paragraphs. Type whatever comment you want, then hit double enter and type in your tip amount/moniker and the bot reference. Then the bot will choose the lowest tip amount/moniker in the same line/paragraph as its name.

Bitcoin is digital currency, created and held electronically with no single entity controlling it. Transactions are made with no middlemen or banks, no hidden fees and no need to give your real name!
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:01:53
No spaces actually made it more tricky! =)
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:36:33
If you've sent every single BTC out of your BCI wallet into your Trezor and don't ever expect any incoming tx into those BCI addresses again, yeah you can delete the private keys.
Basically, if you won't ever use those addresses again, you don't really need to hold onto those private keys. Just be 100% sure nobody else is going to send you BTC through those addresses again. Feels like repeating myself, but you get the idea.
@_date: 2014-12-22 20:48:58
So you created a new address on BCI web wallet? And it disappeared the next time you logged in? Did you archive/label the address or log in from a different place/into a different wallet?
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:04:58
Ah, so that's how it works! 290 bits, thanks!

Do you turn off your router/computer or leave them on 24/7? When you turn them on, is your computer the first to boot up before your router?
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:33:41
I checked and saved more than one of them just to be sure, here you go.
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:36:26
Well, you can send the BTC amount you want to gift him to an address and then transfer the address's private key to the flash drive and gave it to him with instructions on how to open a wallet and sweep the BTC into his new wallet. (Try not to use import instead)
Or you can simply open an online wallet for him, send the BTC to that wallet and simply tell him the wallet login/password details. Or even create a portable wallet like Electrum on that flash drive, send your BTC to it and pass it to him along with the Electrum password. There are plenty of ways to do this really, just choose whatever suits you best.
Remember that to be able to spend the BTC, he needs the private key, not the address. So, private key is most important and thus secure it properly.

The big F. ;P

Very nice, didn't know some of them even accept BTC till I saw your list!

Go to export and check if you still have the key, else try importing one of the earlier backups and check again.

Like adsense but in the dark?
@_date: 2014-12-26 08:27:33
You can test it all by yourself too. If weeks don't turn into months, I don't mind doing this.
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:51:53
Take note of the order, which boots up first? Computer or router?
@_date: 2014-12-23 10:37:02
Sure did! Much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:56:09
That's novelty! Upvoted.
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:09:10
I actually experienced your problem in the past. I believe it has something to do with the Win 7 64. Another thing I noticed was that it happened less when my gateway and router was fully up and running before I even turned on my pc. The problem happened mostly when there was a significant download/upload bandwidth spike.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:21:17
Watching with popcorns!
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:38:42
That happened to me before, give it an hour or two. The tips will eventually go through.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:04:59
Any left to spare?
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:08:28
Funny how it's actually timestamped when you first created it rather than when people collect it. Still very exciting nonetheless!
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:11:03
Actually, it was just random luck! Haha...
@_date: 2014-12-22 23:30:05
I just love a happy ending! =)
By the way, has been shut down, don't think that tip will work anymore. We all use now, go check it out.

Looks like you've been pasting without the slash for over a dozen comments now. =P

S: "Have you read the white paper?"
N: "Yeah, did you really write it?"
S: "Of course not, I hired a ghostwriter for that!"
N: "Wait, there are ghostwriters for white papers?"
S: "There are ghostwriters for everything! They'll even write nursery rhymes for you if you want."
N: "Huh, who needs a ghostwriter for nursery rhymes anyway?"
S: "Don't know, don't really care. The guy I paid said that he also does nursery rhymes and obituaries, if asked."
N: "Actually, obituaries sound very fitting for a ghostwriter."
S: "Yeah, but we shouldn't be talking about something so morbid now. This is a new beginning, a new era! We're going to make history here!"
N: "No doubt. This will either send us to the moon or turn us into laughing stock of the century! But there's still one thing bothering me, whose name should we put on the paper?"
S: "Good question. We're eccentric, bordering on insanity. Some people might even call us demented but we're definitely not stupid!"
N: "Exactly, we need to think of a pseudonym instead. Something foreign, something exotic."
S: "Agreed. Best if we can incorporate our initials into the pseudonym somehow, my ego could use a boost!"
N: "Sure, why not? Do you speak Japanese?"

Use your original identifier to login instead. If you have email notifications on, it's on those emails.

Nice format for the list, less scrolling needed!
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:28:11
Not sure if I can help but send me anyway.
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:47:19
Very generous of you! Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:07:43
Still looking?
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:17:00
Nah, thank **you**! =P
@_date: 2015-01-20 18:58:04
Bit by bit, the list lengthens!
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:47:40
Much appreciated.
@_date: 2015-05-12 21:04:28
Though I don't comment here that much, I can still remember back when the list was not yet formatted. You put out a reward and someone finally formatted it as a table with only 2 columns at first and then multiple columns later to lessen the need for scrolling. After that, you categorize everything, shortening them further and the list just keeps growing... That's some real dedication! I just didn't realize it has already been 6 months!! Well... Good luck to your future endeavors, Captain Charity! =P

If you have the private keys, the wallet itself doesn't really matter. By transfer, you mean sweep or import? What balance is only 30% of what?
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:01:18
Can you talk about how this locking to specific client can be accomplished in any practical way through code? Remember, everything is open.
@_date: 2015-08-29 05:56:58
Are you restoring from QT/Core wallet?
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:06:00
Not quite sure I follow your question but what exactly are you worried about? As long as you still have all the private keys, your bitcoins are safe. That's just a format compatibility warning. What are you doing or planning to do?
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:22:15
Right click that row with the label 1.
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:50:11
For time being, wait it out. Someone's rebroadcasting it and your transaction's priority is actually quite high so it might get confirmed later but if it's still not confirmed after 2 days, you need to contact that Norwegian website for either a refund or a higher fee transaction.
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:40:24
You can use any blockchain explorer, among other stuff. The problem with your transaction is that the fees/byte aren't high enough to be included in a block with the current spams going on. And since it was sent 13 hours ago, it's not being relayed much now.
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:05:00
Other issue is that nodes increase their minrelayfee now to help combat the spam and his transaction falls victim to that.
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:36:25
I'm going off, so I'll answer what I think you're asking.
Save a copy of your Armory data directory before upgrading if you're worried about that. But since you already exported all the private keys, that shouldn't even be an issue. As long as you have all the private keys, you can create and sign transactions elsewhere without relying on Armory.
Remember that sweep is different from export/import. Don't import those private keys into your new wallet, especially a HD wallet such as Electrum. Just sweep everything instead. In other words, make a new transaction and send all your balance to a new address in your new wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:17:03
What's your bitcoin address or the transaction id?
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:41:59
Not if it has a high chance of being dropped.
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:31:21
Okay, your transaction hasn't been confirmed yet. That's why you don't see it in your balance and with the ongoing 'stress test', it might not get confirmed for a while... Who sent the coins anyway?
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:30:26
Just give it some time, let everything be confirmed and it should resolve by itself.
@_date: 2015-03-17 15:58:32
Oh, you categorize them now. Nice!
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:42:27
Don't worry, it is not gone forever. What's the transaction ID or address? It will either end up in a block, meaning you've successfully sent it, or be dropped from the network after couple of days so that you can send it again.
@_date: 2015-10-04 16:51:52
Delete everything in your Bitcoin Core data directory, then reinstall if applicable and run it again.
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:56:41
No, the ongoing malleability attack on Bitcoin is not specific to you or Mycelium. As for your transactions, just wait for everything to be confirmed at least once before creating new transactions from scratch.
