Please don’t post MSNBC Fast Money stuff here. The lady’s husband works for Bitcoincash and has been pumping it thru her

So they’re letting you use it for free? Paying the property tax and deciding that they don’t need any rent money?

Google how to recover BTC from BCH address. It’s a little bit of a process but not too hard

I think you should learn how to invest safely first! Otherwise, I would just keep holding your coins for now
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:21:49
They do

I’m sure there’s a bunch but one I can think of is accessibility. Credit Unions are usually local institutions. So your credit union won’t have a branch even one state away. So if you’re ever SOL outside of your home area you won’t be able to access your money

You just pulled a random number out of your ass

Lmfao, who thought of using the word telegraph in Bitcoin business name?!
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:43:28
Yeah i think that correlation has also been established before

Nice article!

Bro I’m sorry but you gotta get fat again.

A loaf of bread for $20 in 2017?

“Could you stop fucking with the Bitcoin market?”
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:51:20
Yah with today’s prices it’s gonna be more like $4 of BTC
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:09:57
No, he lost the number of bitcoins times the price at the time he lost it.

nice website

Only put a small amount for what you need on the Ledger, everything else do cold Storage.
Encrypt your exchange passwords, write down hints or whatever but not the actual password itself.
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:41:15
Hot and Cold Storage simply means how easy is it to access the data. Ledgers are “colder” Storage but what I’m saying is that the Ledger in your backpack when traveling is probably going to be money you want to access whenever. So, if you get stopped at the border or whatever and they ask you to open your ledger or something ridiculous like that, you’d rather show em your Ledger with $1,000 than a Ledger with $100,000. So, I’m just saying separate your funds that you don’t need immediate access to (cold storage) from the funds you do need access to (hot Storage). This can be two different Ledgers or whatever. Not sure why the response to me from u/alexrecuenco is so hostile lol, possibly just having a bad day or misunderstanding the concept.

Any suggestions for outside sources that are good, bitcoin.org for sure
@_date: 2018-04-30 08:04:17
Thats what I thought. I'm working on BitStarted.org. I just made it and am trying to add more stuff if you have any suggestions.
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:40:42
Yeah but I wanted to make this super simple and basic before the move on to more stuff
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:47:55
Stop being bad and annoying .
