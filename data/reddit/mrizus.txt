I understand where you are coming from with the whole loaned money thing, but it's not through a bank it's through a lending agency, they don't care what I do with the money once they know I have the income in order to pay it back, which I do, they don't know what I am using the money for so the reason they won't give me that money is still unknown

Yeah I know the loan could possibly turn into a bad idea, I'm thinking I'd be probably best off taking a loan and playing some online poker which I have an understanding of rather than playing it into bitcoin haha the interest on the loan is pretty ridiculous tbh, if I was to get the €1000 I'd have to pay €300 in interest, it's quite a shitty loan but it's quick cash

sorry only getting around to reply back to you now, busy at work the past few days, thanks for your great reply! that is a pretty decent prediction and definitely has me 100% sure that I am going to invest, I put in for the loan yesterday so should have it by next week, should I invest my money in before the fork or wait till after it?
You say that when the chain splits into 2 it will be half BTC and the other half B2X, whats going to be the price of a B2X coin after it splits? will I have to sell my B2X coin to put back into BTC and it will still leave me with my current 1000 investment or will I lose out on money? sorry im still a little confused, as the title says newbie to this lol 
Once again thanks!

it sure is! its still an affordable loan for me to pay back and its just the only way I can get quick cash so it'll have to do lol

First of all I wanna say thank you very much for your detailed reply!! This is literally the reply I was looking to get! I understand a lot more now on how the investing end of things work with it, you definitely know what your talking about.  
I am not investing in more than I can pay back, I borrow the loan of €1000 and have to pay back €50 a week for 1 year and have to pay back €300 on top of that €1000 in interest to the lending agency, its pretty shitty interest but its the only way I can get €1000 fast!!
I earn about roughly €360 weekly and after bills, rent and shopping I am left with about €200, I still live at home so being able to put money back into more bitcoin like you said and being able to pay back the loan weekly shouldn't be a problem.
I don't really spend much on going out to place very often or drinking at the weekends, I might do this maybe twice a month but I am always cautious on what I am spending which is a plus!
I don't plan on making immediate profit, I want to l just wanna buy some coin next week and then sit on it for a long time, I am not going to spend any of it or cash out, I understand that there will be a bit of turbulence the next couple of months with bitcoin rising and falling but once I do see a profit in the long run I will continue to invest.
I am going to follow your advice and go about it as you would, you sound like you have done your research on the future of this coin and its going places! I am going to start doing my own bit of research.
I plan on buying my bitcoin through Bitpanda.com and then sending my coins to my Electrum wallet, I dont plan on keeping my coins on any website wallet cause you never know what could happen with them.
Once again thank you very much on the reply! you have got me sold into making this investment haha 
I will make sure to let you know how I get on in the next couple of months!

That's not too bad at all! I've definitely made up my mind and going to invest but the thing I keep reading about this bitcoin fork? What is this all about? I know that it splits the block chain into 2 separate chains is that right? And there will be 2 versions of coin but how would that effect normal BTC?  
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:00:41
Sweet! Thanks for the reply, I think I'll take out the loan and then go ahead and invest, yeah I wanted to know if I invested 1000 what the ROI would be after let's say 6 months but I suppose that's hard to tell but i hope it keeps going and going! Haha

I'm not emotionally attached to money at all, it comes and goes and can be always earned back, I don't wanna make millions off this investment but wanna just do it as maybe earning a little side income in the future if I sit on it long enough and bitcoin does well

Thats insane haha I'd say that was a great feeling being able to pay that back! I'm almost debt free, this investment will hopefully pay off the rest of my bills and hopefully make some money for myself!

I can pay this loan back, I have always been good when it comes to paying back loans from anyone, I work part time and go to college and get paid to go, so I do have money that I don't mind losing if in the event of some sort of crash
