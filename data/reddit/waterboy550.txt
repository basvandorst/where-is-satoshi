I'm aware at how Armory works and have been trying to get it updated and reading the database for about a week. I needed the funds to add to a down payment for a construction loan. Great to see there is still a sense of needing help makes you an idiot in the BTC world!

Just an update.... so the the wallet I had backed up only had two addresses associated with it.
* 1CqmjgYj46vRqBxFvbt5WsqMudRShhGKmD
* 1NNcPWKhowH7QhKDAjRYrdBFVbAHoDDcCe
I noticed 2 of the payments went to different addresses, this concerned me as I don't know how I could have sent them to the wrong place. In Armory I simply clicked "receive coins" and the send to address ending in Smzu was added to my wallet. I did this one more time and now the send to address ending in xnxnA was added to my wallet.
So now I have all the addresses in my wallet, but the balance is still showing 0 in Armory.
I have fully downloaded the blockchain and Armory says it is up to date building and reading the database, but my balance remains at 0... I'm feeling better, but still a little lost.

I figured it out... I finally said screw the whole armory thing! I exported the private keys, all 4 of them. Then imported to a blockchain.info wallet. The balance was then transferred to this new wallet, yes I had to pay a $0.11 fee for the transfers. Then I transferred the balance to my original coinbase wallet, paying the $0.11 fee again, and sold the coins for cash... I paid about $0.50 in fees, but got my cash.
I was having issues with Armory and pointing the blockchain to another location. Bitcoin core worked fine downloading the blockchain, however Armory would sit for days at initializing database... doing nothing. No matter what settings I used I could not get Armory to read and process the blockchain. Whatever, I got my coins and the cash. Thanks for the help!
