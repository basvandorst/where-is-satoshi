So then are the people who said that LN will kill altcoins incorrect? What's their reasoning to how LN will do this?

Honestly, I'm not much of an advocate because the transition could be a big deal and make some sharp changes in the price, but I feel like in the long run it might be a good idea.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:44:43
Oh wow, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:19:58
Thank you! This is basically exactly what I was looking for!
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:39:57
Oh ok, thanks! I'll look into it.

Do you have the card? How long have you had it? Have you had any errors with it?
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:00:40
I've looked into both, and I have a problem with both. 
Bitpay: The Bitcoin is converted to dollars when you send it, and I basically need it to be converted at the time of swiping.
Shift: I'd rather not hold my Bitcoin in Coinbase because I can't control my private keys.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:21:07
I know that it probably isn't, I'm just not sure why.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:17:15
There's nothing wrong with the idea of it, I guess I made it sound like I hate it. The main problem is that it stores the money in dollars and not in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:49:23
Oh wow ok, what alternative would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:37:42
And so the switch from Bitcoin to dollars is at the time of the transaction or is it when the Bitcoin is sent to the card?
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:19:33
I'm not just getting a one for the profits, I'm interested in contributing to the community. Only reason it has to be profitable is that I just want to at least make my money back.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:35:35
Yes you can.

I've seen a bunch of tutorials on how to test the lightning network with bitcoin core, and they all mostly say to run core in regtest mode. I'm using version v0.15.1 . I'm new to this testing, so any help would be appreciated.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:22:45
Well of course it is possible, but I've seen a lot of people say this graph is inaccurate and that bitcoin is not a bubble. So I'd like to know their reasoning to have a response to the people that tell me this.
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:55:26
Yup, that's what i meant, so thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:36:02
How do we know that the programmer of bitcoin isn't manipulating the system and giving himself/his family/his friends etc. bitcoin for free?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:16:16
Yes I am, and what are the differences between Centra and Tenx?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:21:34
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:31:53
And obvi I don't know if it won't, but you get the idea.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:01:07
I probably wouldn't be able to do that, thanks though.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:31:25
Good point, I guess I meant some more reasoning I can use, because when people compare this graph and bitcoin, I have no other thing to say but "It wont" when I know there are other reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:18:10
Do they store the money in Bitcoin or in dollars? I'm mostly only really interested if the switch from Bitcoin to dollars happens at the time of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:49:06
What do you mean? Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:56:01
So then do you know of a good card that minimizes on these? Again, these have to work in the US and they have to store the currency in Bitcoin and convert to USD when I swipe the card.
