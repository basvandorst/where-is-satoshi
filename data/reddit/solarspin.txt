No need to elaborate. Sometimes people need cash in hand. I only hope that he and his family get what helps them most, ASAP. I hope this Newsweek turmoil turns into something good, instead this negative situation.

Sorry, I knew that. I just know that sometimes people really need money in hand fast. I have a lot of empathy for his situation. I thought the intent of the mention that He sold his trains, which are items the Newsweek article made seem quite important, was meant to impart urgency to his situation. I am probably wrong. I don't know anything about what he and his family are going through.

Dorian probably needs the bitcoin donations turned into dollars sooner than later. And no, I do not find that ironic. Most people need dollars to  pay their expenses. And he appears to like most people, unlike what Newsweek made him out to be.

:)   No problem, I appreciate the comeback. My thoughts are with Dorian's immediate needs.

Maybe when your routines and habits become disrupted, especially if you used them to live as cheap as possible, it costs your budget more money. Say you used to go place A on Tuesday for a lunch special, but now you feel like everyone is looking at you there, so you go to place B which costs more. And so on. But I'm just guessing.

Spoken like a brother that truly loves his older brother. And yes I agree, the blind greed of the people at Newsweek is repulsive in respect to this whole affair.

I voted this up, because it helped me learn more about tipping and about Bitcoin. Thanks.

I like the paper design.
