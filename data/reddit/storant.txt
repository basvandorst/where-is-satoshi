I might disagree with what Ver sometimes says, but saying "I'm a self made millionaire" is nothing to be ashamed of or complain about.
It should be a point of pride that you achieved something that is so difficult to achieve.
Here's hoping more people from this sub can say that :)

Yeah you are right about that one, context matters. 
And becoming a self made millionaire by committing fraud doesn't help at all.

Are you adjusting for difficulty changes?
Here's your set up thru my calculator. 
This assuming - a reasonable monthly diff inc, btc val inc (pretty favorable assumption) , miner dep, all values i inputted seem reasonable to me.

Cool, i completely agree with that, and wish u the best of luck on your investment. 
Just a question, do you know what bitcoin mining difficulty is and how it works? Because that and the price are the largest factors in our calcs. And from a cursory look at you calc, you seem to be ignoring the difficulty aspect.

I saw that, and i chose to comment to possibly highlight that your spreadsheet might be *quite a bit* optimistic. (even my calc is pretty optimistic)

While you are right to some extent, the difference between mining in a pool which my model does, and your nicehash model will not be so large as to make them much more profitable than my calc suggests. (feel free to poke holes in it, any input is good)
Im all for long btc as well. But I built that spreadsheet for when i purchased my miners which i soon sold because of my spreadsheet. Sometimes the better ROI is just buying and hodling BTC vs buying miners.

Kinda funny how they list the btc price on top but says bch is true btc.

Video from where that quote likely originated
Long, but amazing and informative video of the Canadian Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce discussing BTC and Blockchain technology (“Study on the use of digital currency”) on October 8th 2014 with Andreas Antonopoulos.
