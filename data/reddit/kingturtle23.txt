jesus fuck that's outrageous, I doubt they'll have any money left after paying that high of a fee.

I find it funny that every few months or so this story is brought up again and people still get blown away by it
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:46:59
Personally I set an amount I'd like to hold, buy double that, whenever that holding goes up 100% I sell half which covers my initial investment. After the initial investment is out since I won't lose any money it really depends on how bullish/bearish I feel when I shave off more profits. I mainly do this with alts though.
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:35:04
laughing but it hurts, since this falls inline with me a lot. I always tell people not to put money in bitcoin just because I know how brutal it can be even thought I truly believe in bitcoin and think it is a solid thing to have.
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:08:26
That same exact study shows exactly why it's a healthy thing. Given the real volume shows the supply is truly limited. As the study says, if most of the trading volume on BTC was real, that would be a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-03-31 17:13:34
Fiats just correcting, this is normal, wait till 2030 when fiat destroys btc.
@_date: 2018-10-07 20:19:36
Really now?
@_date: 2018-10-07 22:17:50
then they make fun of the "bag holders." top tier tactic.

@_date: 2018-10-14 19:12:32
I think he may be asking why are there fees in the first place, to which the answer is: Other than the transaction fee that comes with BTC itself, the exchange needs a way to make more money.
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:19:53
it stays pending until it goes through. bout a year ago they installed a gps system for bitcoin so it won't get lost anymore.
@_date: 2018-10-09 13:56:44
I only really use DEX.
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:12:45
I never had a problem with bcash itself, my main problem is they keep doing this misleading shit trying to spin it as the actual bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:06:37
People can adapt it whichever way they like, it shouldn't make you cringe. What should make you cringe  is the people who say "hodl" doesn't work in a bear markets when that's literally when the thing was termed by good ole drunkie.
@_date: 2018-10-07 11:20:44
@_date: 2018-10-06 13:22:33
all of them.
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:43:04
lmao what is this
@_date: 2018-10-05 15:43:41
but he didn't say hodl ltc.
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:01:48
delayed till December. im pretty sure.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:59:36
Someone's got a lot of pent up anger giving that came out the blue, but in the famous words of Kanye, I'ma let you finish, but eth ain't a currency.
@_date: 2018-10-03 01:38:46
most likely not.
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:23:16
nice self promo tactic.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:30:56
Aka they're trying to stop scams. Notice it's cracking down on ICOs, not BTC or ETH.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:37:56
Banks were against cryptocurrency but it's pretty much known you can't really stop it, and as the saying goes, if you cant beat them join them.
@_date: 2018-10-12 01:34:42
First off what the hell is cps coin. Second, This question might be better asked in r/cryptocurrency or in their own subreddit.
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:17:47
when ico?
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:10:49
I expected much more panic when I saw the title.
@_date: 2018-10-07 20:44:26
@_date: 2018-10-12 01:53:06
Seeing the replies, I'll help clarify: what he's saying is bitcoin will never go to $0.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:34:45
to some people in this space I'm sure being in 4% profit overall is gonna make 'em jealous.
@_date: 2018-10-09 21:09:01
It depends, mostly with this dip IDEX since I was buying erc20 tokens.
@_date: 2018-10-04 03:17:10
Somehow I didn't get bingo.
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:20:51
depends on the seller.
@_date: 2018-10-06 11:22:00
uh that's not the proper usage of hodl.
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:26:49
every time I see the term normie I die a little. I'm not doing well
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:45:21
I take it you've only been in crypto from 2017-2018.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:43:04
This won't age well.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:47:09
You can't exactly say it's never going to be valuable when it's already thousands of dollars soo uh that's one thing but still. It won't age well because as you said this will bear a mutli year bear market but it will end.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:54:56
I don't have my money in BTC exactly  as I already see other projects that have outgrown it, just crypto in general. I take it you're new to investing or you wouldn't be asking that question at all. The "why keep your money and watch it dwindle one". I actually have made a bunch of smart moves in my life but I do believe Crypto will be another one. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:55:18
Smart man.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:18:22
New invester eh? Cryptocurrency always goes down and comes back up around the $200 range. I just started on July  31st (funny enough) and I invested $600 when it was at $2,794. Then it went down to like $2,710 and I panicked but I couldn't cancel (thank god).  Take it from me, HODL it'll go back up.  It might take some time, but it'll go back up.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:49:58
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:45:39
You want Reddit users not to use memes?
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:56:07
Yes I've considered it and that's literally exactly why I'm holding, selling is the dumbest thing possible at this point and time. Bitcoin is HIGHLY unlikely to die but even if it does you still get  2x for holding it.  This whole thing was blown out of proportion just like the bitcoin cash fork.
@_date: 2019-02-14 11:19:55
If you don't mind my asking, why exactly are you interested in bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:51:06
We're going to slowly start phasing out of the early adoption phase in 2018, 2019 and 2020, I'd guess after BTC halves in 2020 that's when we'll see the real bubble form, then after that bubble pops btc will be back with ATH. That is along as the stock market stays up.
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:02:32
Implementing a system like this would directly go against bitcoin at it's core, because it would basically be censoring certain wallets and it would bring a degree of centralization. Yes it's shitty people are scammers but that's what you'll get with a open system where people are their own banks.
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:19:09
Yea, this would be a great idea if bitcoin was more closed off, but since bitcoin at its core is a open system where anyone can join and be their own banks it wouldn't be accepted lightly even if it is a good thing such as blocking scammers.
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:45:03
everyone's loosing their shit for no reason, simply hodl bitcoin there'll be the split you'll get both bitcoin will go down a bit because of people going into alts and segwit will go down also because of the same thing. Month later bitcoin will be right back up and segwit will probably be with the rest of the forks.
@_date: 2019-02-14 11:14:05
So let me get this straight, you actively want a system that can block someones wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:46:39
Took a nap with everything still being in red, woke up to a everything in green confused as fuck. Gotta say one of the best feelings.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:12:33
Ideally it should be, because then people could be selling their bitcoin to buy things that are more profitable given a crash which establishes bitcoin more of a currency and a safe haven. My point was as long as the stock market stays up that should be how it plays out (in my mind at least). Only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:26:51
What the fuck? No one honestly expected you to do it, that's the most disgusting shit I've seen in a while.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:24:39
What? what's so hard to understand about that? So let me get this straight, you don't quite understand the fact that if you buy 1 bitcoin, regardless of if the price goes up, it's still 1 bitcoin? Er..that's about the easiest thing to understand when it comes to bitcoin, It's just appreciating.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:29:44
Yes it is, I'm quite surprised this shit isn't banned off of this subreddit and put on the deep web already.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:22:42
RemindMe! Of this in 1 year
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:38:59
You call me "turd" then say I must be young and have a low I.Q, sure little one.  
Anyways my reason for putting RIP wasn't that you couldn't buy back, but it was because you tried to predict the market and you were wrong and it's should be common knowledge by now that you don't try to predict the market in an unpredictable market such as cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:19:56
Haven't you heard of the term only invest what you can lose? "Am I screwing my life up" shouldn't even be a question. You sure you've taken a couple of years to debate? Because surely you would know to just Hold on, nonetheless just hold on to it and you'll be happy. It's at ATH so it will correct, no telling much though. So just don't panic, in a couple months you should be happy.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:21:15
Everything you invest in is gambling, this is just way riskier.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:22:50
You must be new! Hodl = Hold on for dear life, so yea. Legend says it came from a drunk guy... 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:17:18
It's already used as a currency, so uh ya.
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:25:15
Woah pal! I did look at the other comments and I have confirmed you were 100% serious! 
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:32:26
Alright, remember this then it's gonna be a roller coaster in the beginning until the next few months and you don't lose till you sell. Try to distance yourself from bitcoin (it's gonna be hard) until a few months from now. Especially since that 1k means a lot to you.
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:01:43
So if you want them to stop why did you decide to go whine and make one? Kinda confused here!
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:56:30
Its mined!!
