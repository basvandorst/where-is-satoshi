I meant a few weeks, from December 22nd it's barely moved above 12k and below 9k. It's stagnated.

Coinbase is the app that allows you to buy and sell BTC, BTH, ETH and LTC - but they use GDAX as the exchange, so you're actually buying from GDAX - Coinbase is just the app.

Yeah absolutely! Like I said, "I reckon" so it's all just my own opinion. I'm not on the "It's gonna crash!" train, but I am definitely on the "It'll plateau out and stagnate for a while" train.

Remember in 2015 to 2016 when BTC lingered around 200/300 all year? I think it's plateau'd again at around 10k. It hasn't gone up or down drastically for a couple of months now, I think it'll settle down at this price for a year or two - it's been overcooked. Too many people are buying into it now, and selling it as well - the growth will never be as quick and volatile again.

You joke about, but short selling like this is the best way of making money on crypto.

Congrats on your 0.0013 btc! What do you plan to do with the 0.0011 btc you just acquired? Will you save that 0.0001 btc?

I'll get my grandkids to call yours because we'll both be long gone by then.

We have been waiting for that for nearly seven months now...

What has this got to do with the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:45:27
And the price will continue to go down. Having people hoard money doesn't increase the value of money. It happened in the Roman Empire with their gold coins - people started hoarding them and they went into an economic crisis because not enough money was floating around the economy. As a result they had to mix other, non-precious metals into their gold coins to fix it.
The price will carry on going down, the best way to use bitcoin isn't to hoard it but actually use it and get it working for you. Buy stuff with it, use the lightning network, buy more bitcoin and sell more bitcoin. Just use it like a normal currency! That's what it's for!

Congratulations on actually using cryptocurrencies like it's supposed to be used and spending it, rather than HODL'ing it like the rest of the fucking morons on the subreddit who think by doing so it'll increase in price. Keep it up - it's what Satoshi wants!

People cutting their losses before bitcoin carries on dropping like a rock? It's finished. Move on.

If everyone thought like this, the crypto bubble wouldn't have burst. Unfortunately, most people seem to be invested for a financial gain. This post exemplifies that.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:06:20
I mean the last seven months have been a clear indication of that.
@_date: 2018-07-06 10:29:36
It's literally just retards who have HODL'd through the bubble burst, posting memes about BTC value going up again in the hope that it actually does and they recoup some of their money.
It used to be people who were actually into blockchain and decentralisation, posting interesting articles and who viewed BTC for what it is - a decentralised, unregulated money system. 
Now, you get one of those posts every 10 posts. The other 9 are the people who are clearly only into bitcoin for the monetary FIAT gain. It's sad.

It was a hype - everyone was getting on it, people were scared to miss out on the potential "get rich quick" vibe. But there were always sceptics in the ears of each buyer, telling them that it would crash - and to be honest, most casual crypto investors knew in their gut that this was probably too good to be true. So as soon as it started crashing around new year, people panic sold and now it's gone down to what it is now.
There isn't as much news coverage on it, its not as much in the mainstream, it's just a bad thought in peoples minds now. It'll never get back to being as mainstream as it was around Christmas of 2017.
Set a reminder in however long you think it'll take to get back up to 20k and prove me wrong on this thread when that timer is off. But honestly, I think this circle jerk SR is just content in covering their ears, shutting their eyes and telling themselves that everything will be on the up soon.

Yep - I feel sorry for people who still have money tied into cryptocurrencies. I sold half at the double, so I'm in for a free ride, but honestly - I can't see it going back up to what it was. The bubble's burst but people are too busy telling themselves a bullrun is incoming to accept it.
