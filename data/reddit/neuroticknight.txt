Not the point, it's  pointless that you can have money, if there is no way to earn it. Currently government can tax the really rich so, that the poor can get some amount of cash. This prevents that. You can say people who can't earn btc can die of starvation for all you care, but you can't say they won't be dying. With current laws, government can't take away the money from Apple or Google either. How is the next generation bitcoin billionaires hoarding change anything for someone too poor to mine.  
Honestly, you gotta give a better argument than with BTC you won't be taxed. Because it's kind of obvious.  What is the solution for people who can't obtain btc is what I'm asking.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:08:32
How exactly is it different for BTC though, rich can afford more hardware than the poor, so they can mine more than the poor. Both BTC and Fiat, are designed with a philosophy of finders keeper and 1st come 1st serve.

Everyone isn't and i know that, that is why we have nationalised health care. Where government pays a doctor from common tax pool and helps the patient through the same. The thing is I don't agree with communist philosophy stating "everyone takes the same effort" but it also is equally false capitalist philosophy that says "everyone starts of the same". You try to strike a balance in a society by rewarding people for effort, while ensuring people don't suffer over merely being born into the wrong family.

While all governments are shit, wealth that cannot be taxed is a public infrastructure nightmare. Cryptos solve some problems and bring another.

It is real like numbers or language, not like chalk or paper. Same is true of bitcoins, computers are real, wires are real, the math is as equally intangible.

Bitcoin can't solve income inequality, in fact as seen from many threads, people support bitcoin because it can prevent income equality from being solved. It is a libertarian dream, of taxation free, social contract-free, accountability-free wealth. The entire philosophy of mining itself is finders keepers and 1st come best served. A government cannot be sustained in a bitcoin-based economy and that is what many people here want.

Please, running a bitcoin mining operation doesn't require you to be a tech geek. Just a person with money to buy the required hardware. Ultimately who has more bitcoin and who doesn't is determined by the capital, in old case oil/gold etc in this case gpus. It just generates a different set of new comers with lots of money. A person born two decades from now merely by virtue of being born later will not be able to mine suffice in same amount as much as a miner now.

It is complex factor of race, gender and numerous other things. But basically it is due to access to capital that other people do not have, that allows you to obtain further dividends or provide a bargaining power to negotiate with third parties. E.g say all of us need 30 toilet rolls a year, if you can buy 30 at once you can save up money, if you only earn enough to afford one at a time you don't get a deal. State regulation would allow it to stimulate economy or pour money into key critical infrastructures or reduce value of individual currencies in pool allowing cheaper exports like china or increase it allowing it be a greater store of value like USA. Upside of ending income equality, is less poverty, greater affordability, and social stability which reduces things like crime, orphans, trafficking, and more literate populace also make better decisions and less stressed populations live longer with less medical requirements.
The thing about interfering is that, if you have a good state or government, them having greater access to money means they can do a large scale projects and negotiate more and better deals for community. Bad thing about ability to interfere or benefit of no interference is that if the state is bad then they do not have the power to make things even more shittier for you. Collective actions always have larger more impactful outcomes, in both positive and negative manner. Hence quality of the government interfering is as critical as the quantity of interfering governments can do.

But the problem is not the currency but unequal access to it, it is not that India lacks hospitals, but rather they'd cater american visitors over poor Indians. Bitcoin does not solve that. You can tax the rich and provide a safety net for the poor. But Bitcoin is just a way for you to hide money from that. Bitcoin does a good job of protecting your money for yourself, but please stop peddling the BS that it would alleviate stresses of poverty. Only way to get a lot of bitcoin is to have a lot of fiat. Just like the 1st oil barons of 18th century held power over the economies of the world, 1st people who could get a lot of bitcoins will in the future. But at least the barons had to employ people in order to sustain wealth and thus invested, bitcoin removes that aspect  too.

So, may be it helps the 1% more compared to fiat primarily hoarded by 0.1%. But it can no way fix it for broader anyone. if anything, the wider inflation and fact it cannot be ever reached by good local economic policies make it scary. Because in a century, i can see my country growing up to us economic parity, but by that time, if most global wealth is in bitcoin, even if local can begin to afford tech, it would be too late.

Blockchain has so much benefits that banks are implementing them, and in such a situation there is little incentive for someone to use blockchain powered tech by trusted institutions over random internet speculations. Governments also have incentives to promote such because they need to have control over money or the society will basically collapse as all economic resources vanish into the ether. 3rd people innovate to create something new or to leave their mark, so to them it would still make sense to get loans or invest, with fiat as its inflationary nature reduces impact of loans over time, compared to Bitcoin which punishes investment and rewards hoarding more.

Unless, you want a straight up civil war or callous to think, that it would be decades away and you would be dead. I think you should address income inequality.

If it is not the governments enforcing, it would be corporations, enforcement predates governments, oil barons, warlords, emperors, colonial companies. When there is power people will try to seek it, anarchist free market utopionism or communism, both fail for same reason, belief that unregulated power naturally tends to egalitarianism. It is about placing order on chaos, bit paternalistic yes, but better than going blind. Democratic systems and social systems are so that the distribution of power is structured at least in some means so that it can be utilized to benefit majority of people. Again it is not stealing wealth, but paying dues. Taxation is the membership fee you pay to be a part of the society, if you walk out of it, you do not have to pay.

Not OP, but we can justify taxation because no one truly creates anything, they just rearrange common resources already present in nature, if for e.g a mine has 100 kg steel and you refine it, then next day i find a better process but now the mine is empty, and there is nothing for me to refine, it is not because of my moral failing.  In this view, Your income is just  a commission you get for rearranging natural resources to be more conveniently accessed, and thereby, taxation is not stealing but rather restriction of your commission so that other people who might stake claim to those common resources gain some benefit too, but since you did the process you get to keep most of it.  Hence the social contract, you take a part of societies common resources to enrich your life, and in return you give back some product of your creation. If you can truly create something out of nothing, then you truly do not have to give back anything either.

Just because it is not listed as an inherent effect does not mean, it does not benefit that way. Just like all other human endeavors economics is complex and some effects seen both beneficial and not can be a factor of unintended consequence.
Also success is subjective, if you asked the banks if the current state of Fiat is a success, they would say it is.

However, deflationary currency incentivized you the other way. HODL is obsessive here for same reason.

Stocks are based on perceived value of physical assets and competence of people in a company. Bitcoin is based on faith of users who see it superceeding and destroying global hegemoney.. If you buy most of a companies shares you own the company. If you end up unlikely buying most of bitcoin you will see a market bubble.

Utility matters more than philosophical purity for most people and till bitcoin provides a distinct utility over other currencies or forms, it will not really take off. Current utility of bitcoin is just a speculation machine for most people.

In a sense, non-government currency is better than a garbage government currency. But Bitcoin needs to show utility even when there is a sensible government after all most of the world is not Venezuela and there needs to be a stronger incentive then if a totalitarian tyrant took over your country.

Considering banks trade with anyone from chinese and russian to somali and luxemborg, centralized banks still don't have centralized money. That is like saying Apple wanted mobile phones to fail because they were selling laptops, no they didnt, they sold the freaking iphone when they saw the oppurtunity. Banks are just facilitators of trades and can switch between things, there might be inertia in their large structures, but traditional atms becoming bitcoin atms just require a software and hardware upgrade. they already have necessary infrastructure to so.

International remittance is not a concern for majority of population, again utility outside nice. As for underbanked population , it's not due to lack of banks , people not trusting technology or understanding it. To people who see computers as magic , i don't think bitcoin simplifies anything. Also by the time any member of underbanked population is smart enough to understand cryptocurrency at that point they would understand how to use banks too.

The inflationary nature of fiat, means it is better spent or invested than to hold, the deflationary nature of bitcoin incentivises the opposite.  So as long as that is there HODL will be the dominant philosophy.  You can't chastise people for HODL, when Bitcoin was designed to be so.

But Bitcoin and other crypto is basically throwing resource into nothing, at least when you put in a company stock you invest in the economy and industry and things that produce tangible things. Bitcoin just burns electricity to create no value but arbitrary tokens, which hopefully can be traded for fiat. Bitcoin especially is problematic in a sense that unlike fiat where investing in economy is more profitable due to inflationary nature, the deflationary nature of bitcoin rewards people for inducing economic stagnation. This might be good for holder of bitcoin, but economy has to move for poor people to have at least some basic job and income, none of it which happens when you invest in bitcoin.

All currencies are backed by people, even the Feds, so that is moot. Indian government needs money to build roads as much as US government needs money to build roads too. Bitcoin is about privacy sure, but it is also about obfuscating wealth so that public entities cannot capture them from you. Being in 1st world or 3rd world does not change that. May be you do not want to reveal your money because you want to avoid taxes for personal gain or maybe because you think government is abusing that, it is irrelevant. Ultimately the factor is you employ bitcoin to ensure your personal wealth is not regulated by the state or community, for whatever reason and that is anthetical to being a leftist. Where the wealth of community is seen to be a priority over ability to maintain personal wealth. Maybe you do not trust 3rd world countries to effectively implement leftist policies, and that is a fine argument to make. But still you are using a system of unregulatable money for personal gain and that is libertarian in nature.

Personal wealth is not a tenet of leftism either, which exactly is what Bitcoin protects.  A central system means all money is essentially borrowed from the state rather than owned by any and the state is subject to the will of masses. In a crypto market, the people as a community cannot decide on the allocation of resources or currency, only the individual who holds it can.

Hyperinflation occurred because of a dictator taking over and international sanctions. So assuming all of them had bitcoin, but the local dictator destroyed all crops, and foreign companies are not shipping food into your country? How much money you have mattered. Hyperinflation also occurred for the governing class, but they do not starve because they are not using the money to get food.   
Can we stop pretending that Venezuela's economic problems are because of fiat and not because of artificially constrained access? It does not matter if fiat or bitcoin if another person refuses to sell things to you.

Dictator cannot take over money but can seize assets, even with bitcoin inflation can occur as supply of products get constrained. 
It's funny you bring up Greek crisis because a part of it was the government being unable to print it's own money unable to regulate the economy.

Best Analogy to Bitcoin is Tesla, some people bought shares to make profit, some people bought it because they believed in electric car and eco friendly vehicles. We do not know of Satoshi, but at least Musk personally does not care as he said in long run if tesla fails, he just wants world to shift to green cars even if all are made by GM. So even if Bitcoin crashes, fact that banks across the world and governments are looking into block chain and implementation of it in various manners means we won. Money is and was always ancillary to this, and am sure it was for satoshi too.

Deflation is bad for economic investment though, because if you Open a shop, you risk it being a successful/loss, if you put on bitcoin, it isn't. Imagine in 2012 you wanted to start a website to sell food and decided to put 10,000$, now imagine if you had instead put that 10,000$ in Bitcoin, you would be far richer now. But fewer people would be in the workforce due to lack of that of that shop and though in this scale fewer people would have food to buy. 
You might have more money, all peachy and dandy for you, but if everyone in the society acted in a similar manner, the society will collapse. Think of why the Aristocracies failed, it is because they locked up wealth in a manner that can never be accessed. 
Deflationary money is better for personal good as it allows you to hoard forever, Inflationary money is better for social good because it forces those who hoard to spend and invest. 
The key to a good life with welfare is to strike a balance between these too and that is often what governments do. Because you do want those ambitious to strive higher, but at sametime if majority of people starve or are unemployed then stability is at threat. That is why governments try to balance it. So saying Inflation bad, Deflation good is reductive. 
The great depression that spurred majority of fiat changes was due to deflation.

Actually it will, and it already is because currency 1st and foremost is not seen as a source of income but a stable platform for transactions and current currency does it quite well. Money is useless without industry, you can have all the money in the world, but if no one is selling food you cannot eat bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 10:47:44
You conflate passive with deflationary, stock money is not put in a closet, it is used by companies to build more factories or hire more workers and so on. Bitcoin does nothing to generate physical tangible assets, the stock does. 
Consume less is all great, but the inability to buy food is not, while conspicuous conception is a problem, eliminating all consumption results in society collapsing. There needs to be a way to dial up or down as needed by the governments.

Gold has cultural value; Gold is not paper, it is the book. Books are made of paper but why Book A costs 200$ while Book B costs 20$ is not because of the quality of the paper.   
Bitcoin is also something that relies on cultural value to maintain it's price. If people get bored of gold it will fall, if people get bored of bitcoin it will too. Except Gold is too entrinched in our culture and especially in Asian it is ritualistic and religiously involved too none which is same for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:26:09
I don't think so, just like Oligarchs moved to dollar from gold at start of 20th century, they will flock to bitcoin if it ever becomes large scale accessible and they will hold most of the coins and they will hold most of server spaces that can mine those coins. What bitcoins can do however, if remove pool of money accessible to government and public services and put it further into the private sphere away from taxation, funding and other infrastructure expenses.

That is why you buy a house, gold or anything, dollar is not a store of value, but a medium of transaction. It works when it is inflationary, so that you are not hoarding it in the kitchen, but investing it to produce more.
If you have 1 BTC, you HODL to make more money, if you had the same in dollars instead you will invest in the economy to stimulate business.
Fiat exists to ensure wealth never stays digital/virtual, instead of putting in a bank, you buy a house, you might rent it to people and so on. This does two things one your money is safe and secure and two it provides a tangible benefit, housing other people.
If people could just hoard it in bank then this won't occur and economy stagnates. People who have money have money, those that do not have any means to get it.
You might ask why should you care about people who do not have money, because everytime there was such a situation be it french revolution, colonialism or whatever, people who had money got murdered, which am sure is something you don't want to be.
