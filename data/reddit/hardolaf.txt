Are you open to donating to local makerspaces which are incorporated as 501(c)(3)s?

It's really not for the size of their organization. A good office desk and chair can easily run $1500 for proper ergonomics. A conference table can easily hit $5-10k without even getting anything fancy.
Companies aren't buying shitty pine wood furniture from Ikea. They're buying high quality furniture that will take tons of abuse and hopefully outlast employees who start today and retire in thirty years (chairs are the big exception).
And cabinets? Those things are freaking expensive in terms of labor and wood.
My cubicle at work has $5,000 of furniture.

I lost 10k BTC in a harddrive failure back when it was worth less than $1 per coin. I'm only slightly sad that I can't retire at 24.
But hey, the launch of Dogecoin paid for an entire semester of college for me. So that happened.

They realistically can't do anything more than blow hot air. As long as that company doesn't have a presence in that state, that state has no jurisdiction over them.

I lost 10k BTC on an encrypted hard drive that wasn't backed up which had mechanical failure. Yes, I'm sad that I couldn't sell it back when it hit $1600 the first time. But I won't beat myself up over it.
Everything that I now have is backed up.

This is New York. Not the feds. The Feds went about it appropriately. They classified it as the least regulated security that they could (commodity) and then simply subjected it to capital gains tax. There is almost 0 paperwork involved with the way the federal government is regulating it.
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:18:25
Actually it is treated like all non US currency. They are all commodities when being traded on exchanges and for tax purposes you are supposed to pay capital gains in the difference in value when converting back into USD. It is a consistent method of approaching all currencies. Note that there is very little burden on individuals and businesses under this system.

The secret in all large scale applications is to use multiple databases. So use a relational database with a NOSQL database with a Graph database. As for saying MongoDB does not hold accurate information, that's not true at all. It has different benefits than other types of databases. It also has different drawbacks.

You're talking about medium to large companies. Last I heard, Coinbase doesn't qualify as a medium company yet (100+ employees). They're working as a still small seedling of a company. Not knowing when a supervisor will get to something is perfectly reasonable. Heck, even at my work if an issue gets referred to a higher up in IT, I may not hear anything about it until it's fixed.
Their service is great. It sounds like from this that they were already working on solving it but OP is just impatient.
@_date: 2016-03-26 01:23:48
Chances are that most of their support problems are technical in nature right now because they don't have good support software in place.
@_date: 2016-03-26 01:50:47
They said that a supervisor would email him with more information later. Once it leaves that employees hands, they have no way to know when the supervisor will get to it. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 12:49:31
They're not a bank, they're a payment processor. A one to two week wait time to resolve issues with Visa or MasterCard when there was a technical problem or fraud is also not uncommon.

Chances are they didn't know anything more than OP had already been told so what's the point?

They're dealing with banking here. Have you ever tried to handle any issue related to ACH? It can take two days just to get someone on the phone at ACH to figure out what the hell happened let alone what the status of the money is. Let's not even talk about dealing with banks...

Ever hear of the OTC derivatives market? It was completely unregulated in the 1990s. I think we all know how that turned out.
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:55:58
The SEC not being allowed to audit the OTC derivatives market is what led to the 1999 market crash. Magically, there's been very little fraud since they were given the power to audit the OTC derivatives market. Obviously that's because the market self regulated and lynch all of the bad actors as they go and completely unrelated to any regulations run by the SEC.

Saddam was gotten rid of because his sons were even more fucked up than he was and he was in failing health. Also, WMDs were present in Iraq when we declared the start of the invasion. But they were moved, sold, whatever most likely to Syria right when we started mobilizing.
@_date: 2016-11-30 03:28:55
Declassified last year. There were viable WMDs still in Iraq under government control.

Declassified last year by President Obama. There were still stockpiled, viable WMDs in Iraq.

They basically want to formally recognize that it is a currency used by people and to put the same penalties for money laundering with it or scanning people with it in place as actual currency. They also want to monitor and regulate exchanges between government backed currency and virtual currencies to ensure that laws are followed and that markets are not destabilized.
@_date: 2016-11-30 04:49:08
Yes they are. They're even defined as WMDs by the agreement Saddam Hussein signed.

Any tampering of evidence can vacate a conviction faster than you can sneeze if the judge is mad about it. Unlike other issues with evidence, tampering is evidence of malice on the part of the state and the tables turn from assuming that evidence gathered as part of the chain of custody is valid to assuming that all evidence may be invalid and potentially fabricated. Beyond that, there are provisions in law and case law whereby a person may have their conviction vacated and granted immunity to re-prosecution if the tampering of the evidence was material to the case against them even if the evidence clearly shows that the person committed the crimes they have been convicted of.
Basically, tampering with evidence is the single stupidest thing that law enforcement.

Read about Operation Avarice. President Obama unclassified it last year. It confirms that WMDs were still present and under Iraqi control.

The yellow cake uranium was under the control of the IAEA and the AP knew it and still ran that shit article. The US government knew it too. Some members of the armed forces on the ground didn't know it at the time though. That's where the problematic story not backed by the brass came from.

The problem with backing money with a physical thing is that when that physical thing becomes needed in industrial processes, it hurts the economy to base currency on it. It's much better to come to an agreement that this abstract thing has value because as a society we agree that it has value.

It may not have been considered over until later. Also, they did release some details of it in 2006 and people said that they were lying and ignored them. It was fully declassified last year.

President Bush NEVER said, implied, or in any way indicated that Saddam Hussein ever had any type of nuclear weapon. Nor did he ever state that he thought that Saddam was actively manufacturing WMDs. The media claimed that. The presidency and executive branch never claimed that.
As for when this information was discovered, Paul Ryan held a giant press conference telling the public about some of the weapons that were recovered. Later in 2015, it turns out that when he said recovered he meant purchased by the CIA from a former Iraqi government official. People (Democrats) claimed he was lying when he said that they had found WMDs because it was right before elections that he made the announcement.
As for those weapons being there, technically it can be argued that Iraq violated their agreement by not disclosing all viable WMDs to the UN and USA.
Also, there was tons of evidence showing that Iraq was going to start full production again of chemical weapons as soon as the limitations on them ended.
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:20:12
They never said there were nukes. They said there were Weapons of Mass Destruction, specifically Bush and the rest of the government claimed that they had chemical weapons in violation of agreements made after the Gulf War. The media said there were nukes to scare people, the government never said there were nukes because that would be idiotic.
@_date: 2016-11-30 17:42:07
No, the uranium wasn't used as justification to invade. Bush specifically only said WMDs and chemical weapons. WMDs are a superset of chemical weapons. Anyone who inferred nuclear weapons from that wasn't really paying attention. Stop making up facts.
When we invaded that yellowcake was under the control of IAEA and was never part of the justification and is why the US government never tried to use it as justification for the invasion.

ACH might take 2-5 days, but the balance sheets might take longer. I know my bank takes between 6 and 24 hours (during the business week) after it receives an ACH transaction to actually finalize and release the funds to my account. I only know that the ACH transaction has been initiated at the bank because I monitor my finances constantly to prevent fraud. I would suspect a similar occurrence happens at other banks.
