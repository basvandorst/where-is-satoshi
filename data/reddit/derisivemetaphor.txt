Some site feedback:
1. Cryptocurrency donations should cater to the private user.  I am not interested in creating an account, and without doing so, I cannot see how to find the donation address for your project on the site.  Let users create an account if they want, but also expose a "anonymous donation" address.  Also, your whole tour is invisible to anyone who doesn't want to sign up. 
3.  Putting the projects onto the front page with iframes is a little janky - if you really want to do this, be sure to lock the size of the iframe to the maximum size of the page content, so it doesn't show the scroll bar (looks unpolished, bad usability).
4. What is the moon project?  It looks like it is just a painting.  Do you only have two projects?  Between "cancer research" and paintings of a moon, a lot lies in between.  Getting more examples to show what within art and what within science the site is looking for will help people decide from the home page whether this site has stuff they'll be interested in. (Edit: after signing in I see that there are many more projects, show more on home page so your site doesn't look empty).
5. Your research seems interesting... but its completely over my head!  I'd change the "details" section of your own project to something that is easier for the layman to understand.  I think the summary section of your paper would be more accessible than your current details section. Perhaps add a sentence explaining how this research may be relevant to cancer. 
6.  Clicking on a single image and being taken to a slideshow of that one image does not make sense.  If project only has a single image, don't embed slideshow. 
7. Where's the bitcoin donation link?   I don't have to deposit to your website before I can donate, right?
Feel free to PM me if you have any questions, I do tech startup consulting and would be happy to donate a few hours of my time to your project if you'd like some help.

*I'm an idiot, this is not financial advice, don't trade based off of anything I say*
Feds auctioning off 30000BTC in 10x3000 BTC lots (Total value ~ $16.5 million). I'm calling a bubble leading up to Friday, June 27, 2014 and pullback to July 1.
Market has already started to price in the anticipated increase at end of June sell side liquidity from all these coins hitting the markets. Some big players might be selling to pull together funds to try to get a slice, but Bitcoin "believers" probably don't have a lot of cash lying around and getting their coins converted at a good price and out through the banking system could mean cutting it close to the deadline.
I think wall-street is going to notice this and get interested at being able to purchase a large lump sum of Bitcoin, possibly under market price. Even if only half of the buyers are "outside money" (didn't just sell bitcoins to try to rebuy at a better price), that means an influx of $8M into the Bitcoin market - an amount which could easily push prices up 30%, given current market depth. I wouldn't be shocked to see $800.
Smart (and possibly bitter) traders that can't get enough funds together to bid on the auction will want to run up the price preceding the auction - they know people are going to spend more than $10 million buying bitcoin that day, why not make it as expensive as possible for them?
As soon as the BTC are purchased though, it's in the traders' interest to DUMP, DUMP, DUMP, because they know that those bitcoins are about to be available to hit the market.
Then, get out your popcorn on July 1, when the winning bidder(s) get their coins. If they dump them all, prices could easily drop down into the $200 range. If they don't, I'd expect the bubble to churn forward.
Should be exciting.

If you exchange fiat currency and Bitcoin, the exchange will probably have your real name, address, etc.  If those Bitcoins are subsequently used for something illegal, it can be traced back to you (with the exchanges cooperation), a real person who was in possession of them at some point in time.
Practically, if they are used in a crime, you could be questioned and it may be deemed "suspicious" but it is by no means proof that you were the one who used them for the illegal purpose. (If there are multiple addresses between your exchange and the illegal transaction, you could have sent them to the person who used them illegally.  You are not breaking any law by buying a hot dog, and then having the hot dog vendor spend that on pot from a third party without your knowledge.) 
People who launder BTC are probably engaging in crime and don't want to be questioned.   If you grow pot and sell it on the SilkRoad, you certainly don't want the DEA coming to your grow house to ask you if you know anything about it.  
**tl;dr Having possession of certain BTC is not incriminating, but it could provide a link back to you, so some people use laundry services to break the chain of transactions back to them.**

Getting bitcoins isn't the biggest problems.  
I have convinced all my friends that bitcoins are cool.  They like the idea.  I offer to sell them at current exchange rates, but they don't care about speculation so they haven't taken me up on it.
Why should someone want to buy bitcoins right now, other than for the purpose of supporting bitcoin?  Once we solve this question/find the killer app, bitcoin will be permanently solidified.

Not quite on (1).  Bitcoins are "stored" in unspent transaction outputs.  You cannot create a transaction which spends Bitcoin without the output, even if the address has enough funds, because you need to reference the (hash of the) transaction output your are spending as the input in the next transaction.  
(2) is right, you can send from multiple outputs, from the same or different addresses.  
Sillicon's tl;dr is still correct: OP needs to make one large transactions with every "loose change" sized output as the inputs.

I feel like you might be jumping to conclusions.  All the evidence shows is that the BDT operator worked on Kronos and then it got hacked.
Is there any actual evidence that he stole? If not, you shouldn't have posted this thread. 
There are plenty of on-site security reasons to be wary of BDT (and I wont keep my funds there), but baseless accusations don't help the situation at all.  It seems like you are trying to attack him more than warn readers.

A complaint with the BBB will actually get through to them, and they will work very hard to resolve it. If they don't expressly forbid transferring $9 multiply times in their TOS, they have no basis to freeze your funds. If they take a long time to return your funds, you should also ask for interest (even on just $25, its the principle).

Or, take the hash of the contract and use that to generate a Bitcoin address. Upload the contract to a public server, so people can read it and associate it with the Bitcoin address.  Then, register your "public identity" bitcoin address with another public service.  This will allow people to verify that your public identity Bitcoin address has accepted the publicly available contract document.

@_date: 2012-03-22 21:52:25
Without a centralized "taint list" everyone will have to constantly worry whether their coins will be accepted.  
It is impossible to tell, if there are multiple transfers from a theft to current holder, whether that person is the thief or an innocent who accepted the thief's coins (possibly before they were even tainted). 
Tainting coins will only hurt the innocent.  This has been thoroughly debated in the forums.  If you don't think so, post how you think tainting could work to only hurt the criminals.

From the other post:
They would have to give an address out to each individual, who could send a lump sum as described in an email with the required reporting information.

All this info lives in the blockchain. I'm not totally sure what data is in the wallet besides keys, could keep transaction outputs as a speed optimization.
I got really excited about the idea of creating transactions before receiving funds, so you could generate a huge number of 1BTC transactions to move funds to different friends, and then only broadcast them on the network once you get money and need to pay them.  This would get rid of a lot of security issues with storing your private key.  Alas, needing the transaction hash makes this a no-go.  
@_date: 2012-08-16 23:12:49
BDT has bad security, but people are claiming that he is behind bitscalper with very circumstantial evidence.  The sockpuppets are accusing him of stealing from Kronos during the testing period, which there is also little to no evidence of.  
I think security is the only valid complaint against Alberto.  If he lied about security (link?) that's a strike against him for sure, but claims he is a thief seem to be overblown and possibly vindictive.  Could the real Kronos hacker be attempting to misdirect blame onto him?

This is a very unlikely scenario because:
1. There is currently no software which allows you to regenerate from seed and drain a private key on a mobile device.  Holding someone at gunpoint while typing on your laptop, with internet connection, is not very plausible. If you can't verify and drain it on the spot, the victim could get home and drain it first, or simply give you an incorrect pass phrase.
2.  Even if the robber knew that you had 10,000BTC, it is unlikely that he would know for sure that you stored it with a "Brainwallet". It is equally, if not more, likely that the victim has the funds in a wallet.dat or randomly generated private key.  
3. If the robber does not know the exact current balance or address of the brainwallet, the victim can provide a brainwallet with a lower value and a story about how they spent it.
So yes, if the robber knows the victim has a brainwallet, and knows exactly how much is in the brainwallet, they can rob them for the full value.  
If you are really concerned about this, keep your savings in a never-online cold-storage double-layer truecrypt volume with many copies, physical and in the cloud.

The only issue with this is that revealing your public key makes your Bitcoin's slightly less secure (to brute-force attacking and such).  This is the reason the official client sends change to a new address every time you spend an unspent transaction.  In the near term, the solution you proposed is practically acceptable, but as computational power becomes more readily available, it would be nice to have a solution which doesn't reduce the security of your coins.

More options are always better for the consumer.  Fiat money plays a useful role in our economy, and shouldn't be outlawed.  It should exist as a competitor in the currency space, as it has certain benefits: better for paying legal obligations such as taxes.  I'd hate to pay taxes with a good which has a floating rate against the dollar, as you'd never be quite sure if you're paying the right amount.  If Bitcoin goes down on the day I send my taxes in, do I have to send more?
In idealized voluntary commerce, sure Bitcoin is probably better for almost all uses (notable exception with current technology is fast "pay-for-coffee" type transactions), but I think our society is quite far from that.  Baby steps.

A centralized cryptocurrency defeats the purpose of a cryptocurrency. 
Better to just run a virtual currency that is easy to trade and transact digitally, skip the mining part and just track it on centralized servers.  Regardless of how it works, the value is fundamentally centralized with the company, so there is no reason not to put centralized trust in their management of the currency, as that is the currency's only value: trust in the company.

The first client, which is maintained by Gavin, the "official" bitcoin dev, can be downloaded from here:

I remember back when the block reward was 50 BTC, and most blocks got about 0.05-0.1 in transaction fees.  
Today, you get 25 BTC, and we're seeing blocks with around 0.3-0.5 on aveage, with some having 1-3 btc in fees.  
Frankly, I heard and trusted that fees would scale up, but I'm impressed by how well its actually working so quickly. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:28:36
The "previous page" refers to the previous block header.  By requiring miners to include the previous block header in the hash, it prevents miners from being able to start working on future blocks early, because they are missing the block header information required to do so.  It also forces miners to stay connected to the Bitcoin network, so they can see when a new block appears and start working on the next one.

The important feature of the algorithm is that it is impossible to solve in any other way than brute force guessing withh huge amounts of raw computational power, but once a solution is found, it can be verified very quickly by others. 
This allows mining to be diffiicullt - an "honest indicator" - and makes the distribution of newly produced coins un-gameable. But despite being hard to find an answer, once it is found, nodes on the network can quickly receive, verify and distribute the answer (newly found block). 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:21:39
There is really no such thing as a single coin:  all bitcoin is just numbers in an accounting ledger.  If you have two bitcoins, there is nowhere that one starts and the other ends, it is just the number "2". Coins can be identified by the transaction ID in which they were received, sort of like a serial number. 
Totally fungible. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:54:51
Wheneer you spend bitcoins, any "left overs" that you dont send into another bitcoin address are scooped up by the miner that wins the block, and considered a transaction fee. 
(sometimes people mistakes when using bitcoin programatically and forget to send change back to themselves, causing 100+ btc transaction fees. any good wallet client processes change for you properly, just be careful if you're writing you're own.)

There will always be the potential for regret, IMO, until Bitcoin is trading into the $1000s of dollars.  The price being this low makes it easy for money to come in and push up the price. 
Bitcoin technically is inflationary - new coins are being made.  However, because it is not inflating exponentially, as fiat currencies do, and adoption is outpacing inflation, people say that it is deflationary.  
Personally, I think that Bitcoin being deflationary is a feature, not a bug. I like that I can store coins in my brain and not worry about so many new coins being made that my coins become less and less valuable - all i have to watch is the exchange rate.

You actually forgot a third: the Public Address
The Private key is the secret piece of information that lets you spend your Bitcoins.  Its basically just a super-huge number. 
The public key is freely distributed to everyone you want to be able to verify a given message was signed with your private key. The public key is generated by performing a cryptographic algorithm (complex math problem) on the private key.  Every private key generates a single public key, and will generate the same public key each time you put it through the algorithm.  (You can recover your public key from your private key, but not the other way around). 
The private key lets you "sign" something, proving to everyone who has the public key that corresponds to that private key that the holder of the private key in fact made the signature.  Without the private key, it is (statistically) impossible to forge a signature (assuming you're using a strong cryptographic algorithm, as bitcoin does). Bitcoins are spent when the network versifies that a transaction has a valid signature from the owner's private key. 
Bitcoin uses Public Addresses, which is derived from the public key using another cryptographic algorithm.  These have two benefits:
First, they contain a checksum, so Bitcoin clients can quickly recognize some improperly typed addresses.  
Second, when quantum computers come out, they may be able to reverse engineer private keys from public keys. By obscuring the public key with an additional cryptographic method, it may add additional defense against some theoretical quantum attacks.  Your public key is revealed whenever you send a Bitcoin transaction (so they can verify your private key's signature), so it is useful to know that the private keys of Bitcoin Addresses which have never sent funds out might be more resistant to quantum computer reverse engineering.

A "single" bitcoin doesn't really mean anything differnent from 0.9 btc except for the number.   Bitcoins are just numbers in a giant accounting ledger.

I've also used my secure offline computer to generate brainwallets by saving the webpage at :  transferring to my secure computer, and then writing down the seed.

When you mine, you're putting a few things through a hashing algorithm:
- the hash of the last block (so you can't get started on the next block early)
- the hash of all of the transactions in the block (so everyone knows exactly which transactions are included)
- the block reward payout address (to know who gets the block reward)
- a random number
When you find a block for a mining pool - their bitcoin address is encoded into the block you found.  Because of this, mining pools will only accept shares that point to the pool's address. You can withhold the block, depriving the pool of the block reward, but you can't change which address will receive the reward without changing what you're hashing, and starting the mining process over again. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:05:08
When you have a bunch of coins, in an address, these are actually in chunks, called "unspent transaction outputs". Whenever you receive BTC, you get a new unspent transaction output. If you receive 10 0.1BTC transactions, you'll have 10 different outputs to spend. 
When you want to spend coins, you collect one or more unspent outputs you control, specify an amount to be received and to what address, and sign the transaction with your private key. 
If you want to send 0.15 to someone, and have 2x 0.1 unspent outputs, your bitcoin client signs the two outputs to "open up" the unspent outputs. Then you specify that you want to send 0.15 to the recipient.  If you don't do anything else, the remaining unused 0.05 will be given to the miners as a transaction fee.  If not, you create another transaction output back to yourself for the remainder.
Elegantly, any "leftover" BTC is automatically swept up by the miners each block, so the location of every bitcoin is accounted for at all times.

Any good wallet client automatically makes change, so you don't have to worry about this functionally.  You only need to worry about this if you're writing your own wallet client, really. 
But, when you look in the blockchain, you'll see that transactions will often be from an address back to itself - thats the change being made.

You can't do instant withdrawals from cold storage, (unless you're using a brain wallet  but whether that is cold storage is another debate).   A responsible bitcoin business should keep their working capital in a hot wallet, and keep the rest in cold storage.  Reputable depository institutions SHOULD have delays in withdrawals in a bank run - it means they were securing the coins with the proper level of precaution. 
Anyone who says that they keep 90% of funds in cold storage but you can withdraw all of your deposits with them instantly in full at all times is lying to you or doesn't know what they are talking about - be wary.

Paypal and Credit card are "soft" currency - up to 3-6 months later, you can call your CC company and reverse the charge. Because Bitcoin is not reversible, many people in the past have tried selling Bitcoin for CC, but got so many chargebacks they went out of business.

Transaction fees exist because, the amount of BTC miners receive for finding a block goes down over time. Miners are needed to keep the Bitcoin Network running.  As the amount of BTC miners receive goes down, proportionally the transaction fees will make up a larger and larger part of the reward until no new Bitcoins are created, and (hopefully) the fees provide enough incentive for miners to continue mining. 
Also, transaction fees make it possible to prioritize transactions based on value.  This prevents an attacker from being able to fill up every block by issuing a ton of tiny transactions back and forth to himself:  transactions with fees will be prioritized, so these garbage transactions either have to pay (which strenthens the network by adding incentive to mine) or they will have no effect.

You can think of blocks in the blockchain like pages in an accounting ledger. 
There are only so many lines, and often they arent all filled out (blocks aren't always fulll, but they can be). Miners choose which transactions to include, often by transaction fee, and try to put the cryptographic product of all of those transactions, the last block's "name", and a random number.  If the product is above the difficulty target for the bitcoin network, the miner "wins", broadcasts the block, the network recognizes it as valid, and everyone starts on the next block.  If the cryptographic product isn't above the target, the miner keeps changing the random number until they either find a block, or hear that someone else did and get started on the next one. 
This cryptographic process can't be falsified - it can only be performed with raw computational power. You just have to roll the dice billions of times. 
The network verifies that each transaction has a cryptographic signature from the private key that matches the public address the funds are stored in.   Because the cryptography of bitcoin is strong, these signatures cannot be forged.

Bitcoin Addresses are Pseudononymous - or only sorta anonymous. 
Bitcoin is only anonymous when used very carefully.  There is a trail, so people have devised methods of braking the links in the blockchain (by depositing to shared wallet service and withdrawing different coins, mining coins themselves, laundry services) in order to get anonymous control of bitcoin, but any time you're trading USD for bitcoin, the person who receive the USD is going to have some information about you that can be traced forward with those coins. 
One of the unsung features of Bitcoin I personally am excited about: when used properly, is COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT.  For the first time ever, businesses can elect to open their books up to the public in a provable, no-BS way.  All they have to do is publish all of the company's Bitcoin addresses, and the public can see how much funds the company has and what it does with them.

If you're mining through a pool, check their website interface for your balance.
If you're solo mining, it will probably take a while, but when you get a block, it will be a sizeable chunk.  Whether you'll see when you get a block depends which mining client you are using. You can also check the address you're mining to in block explorer - if you see a block reward transaction received, you got a block.

That's one good way.  Coinbase has a 24 rolling limit.  Because of this, if you want 10 bitoincs, and try to buy all 10 at once, you'll almost always hit the limit.  Try buying bitcoins in increments of 1 or 2, (or even 0.11, if you don't think the $0.15 fixed fee will hurt your basis too much). Because buyside availability tends to be small, often only small amounts will be availiable for purchase.  I've only seen the ability to purchase 10 btc on coinbase a few times, for hours, in the past couple weeks. 
About wallets: read my other comment in this thread about private keys.  tl;dr - the private key is what allows you to spend your bitcoin, and if someone else sees it, they can also spend your bitcoin.  You have to keep your private key secure.   If your computer has viruses or spyware on it, they can steal your private key. 
Most recommend generating a private key in "cold storage", or never connected to the internet.  Put your "savings" in cold storage, and keep your spending coins in a "hot wallet", using the standard bitcoin wallet (with an encryption!) or blockchain.info.  I recommend keeping your coins in multiple places to "diversify" your storage. 
Selling locks in a price instantly (no future market orders as far as i've seen), and it initiates a transfer that ends up in your bank account about 3-5  days later.  Once Bitcoins are in your account, you can sell them instantly. Coinbase isn't good for swing trading, because there is almost a week turn arounds on getting in and out of positions - not to mention the 1% fee on each side.

Private keys aren't divided.  You can hold 11,000,000 BTC or 0.00000001 BTC in a single private key. 
The private key is just the "holder" of the coins, and it is always a whole key.  (Well, there are ways of splitting a private key to make multiple different "master" keys required to make a valid signature, but that's a different topic unrelated to bitcoin amounts)

The public could audit it - by publishing a list of all of their Bitcoin addresses, any member of the public can check any deposit or payment addresses the company sends to them against this list.

It doesn't force them to be transparent forever, but the public will notice once they stop.

Offshore bank account in tax havens like cyprus are worth over $30 trillion dollars.  Bitcoin is valuable in that it cannot be seized, there is no risk of the depository institution defaulting, and can be spent from anywhere around the world.  
If 1% of those with offshore bank accounts hear about Bitcoin, and decide to put 1% of their offshore funds into Bitcoin, it would imply $3B of new capital will be coming into Bitcoin, which should in theory more than double its' price from where it is today.

It's not random. You can always send a transaction without a fee.  As an anti-spam measure, some miners only process transactions without a fee if they are older than a certain age (so somone can't clog the network by sending 0.0000001 BTC back and forth to themselves over and over).  
The fee is decided by each client, so what rulles are applied varies from wallet to wallet.

Each Bitcoin Address has a corresponding private key.  This private key lets the coins in that address be spent, and must remain secret (or else others will be able to spend coins in your address).  
Your wallet at its most basic is a collection of one or more private keys. Often Bitcoin Addresses are also saved, but they can be recomputed from the private key, so it is not essential. 
How to import private keys varies client to client - butt all you have to do is import the same private key to all the clients, and they'll all be able to spend the same coins. 
You don't need to run a client to receive coins.  My "savings" coins are in an address whose private key has never been connected to the internet - no client has ever been connected for that wallet.
