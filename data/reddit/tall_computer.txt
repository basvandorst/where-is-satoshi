How does that help?
Scenario: my account gets hacked and my BTC is gone. How do I take advantage of the insurance?

Interesting. Cheers!

It's really not for you to decide what his story is about. "Bad banking" is a problem but there is no "bad bitcoin storage" because there is no trust to a third party. Bitcoin is a solution to the problem that he mentioned.

But if he can't find someone to help him or they just don't want to then he is powerless. Not with bitcoin

It's not the same result because it will be your own fault if something goes wrong.

Pretty dumb picture of text, but banks are shit though and I would rather live in a crypto based version of reality.

Depends on the precautions you take. The point is that the user is in control.

Hey f u

Curious about this. Can you back up the thing you said? The descriptions I find say that Fiat is any currency that does not have intrinsic value or can be traded for something. [
I feel like there is a piece missing for me

Thanks. I had always just associated fiat with the part where it was an alternative to money that was backed.
Curious: Would you like governments to embrace, say BTC, and use it as legal tender and require that we use it to pay taxes? Would that make it fiat if it happened?

I will try to rewire my brain to this meaning of the word then
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:31:16
But then what future are you hoping to see? Crypto gaining traction and being used as an alternative, co-existing with fiat currencies?
With my limited understanding, I think it would be a good thing if crypto became a global de facto currency for everyday transactions. And, no offense, I think maybe that saying that it will \*never\* happen is being a bit unimaginative, being that we come from a past marked by feudalism, slavery and many others things that required changes more massive than this would. It certainly represents a change of paradigm and power structures. But as I see it, it is one of the natural next steps for our ever improving democracy.

I dont like that Bitcoin is seen by some as a criminal currency, so I wish this was posted in the silk road subreddit which is where it belongs anyway, as it does not really pertain to the currency of Bitcoin. Still upvoted though

Bitcoin is a fiat currency. He is using the word as if fiat is the opposite of crypto
