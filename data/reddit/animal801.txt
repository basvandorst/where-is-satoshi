I'm up 2.5x and I'm pissed that I'm not 10x +...  If you're not at least 5x your money, you haven't taken advantage of the frenzy.

Just bought both, love this guy.

Try setting up a business account.. holy - 30+ days... Waiting still

I did it with mine and 4 months later I'm still waiting to buy Bitcoin.  The whole process is a nightmare.

If anything, buy his books.  You'll support him and know a hell of a lot more about crypto.

I've been working through broad financial for months now trying to get invested, and am now stuck at the stage of getting my account setup on one of the exchanges.  Personal account is easy, but business is difficult it seems.  Coinbase and Gemini are taking forever, and I am also attempting on bitstamp and itbit.  The price of BTC has more than doubled since I began this process...  Any advice?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:59:58
You're right, it will correct and we will still be up 100's of %.  Fine with me.

Ive been waiting 40+ days for Coinbase to authorize my business account.  It's an LLC to invest 401k monies.  I'd suggest registering through Gemini, ITBIT, Bitstamp, and basically any other exchange to up your chances of ever getting approved.

My brain never registered the word Bitcoin no matter how many times I may have read or heard about it.  Had friends involved with it early that didn't bother telling me either.  It wasn't meant to be I guess.

It's also going to take 3 months to set up a business account....

Buying a pound of gold is also unobtainable.  That's why you buy in ounces.

I've been waiting 30+ days for Coinbase to verify my business account (401k) money.  I'm &amp;$&amp; pissed as hell right now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:47:49
No reason it can't hit 1 trillion...

@_date: 2017-11-28 06:18:34
Idiotic response.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:36:18
Did you expect it to instantly double?  It fluctuates $1000's on a weekly basis.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:39:40
More like an hour!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:45:34
Price will dip slightly, who cares.
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:33:36
I've been waiting since about September for my business account to be verified.

Quality repost for the 1000th time.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:23:50
I waited 5 months to invest a small 401k.  Got approved at 18k.  Lmao
