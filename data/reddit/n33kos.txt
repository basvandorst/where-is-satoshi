People losing bit coins isn't an issue..hell, even if eventually only a couple thousand BTC exist, .00001 will just be the new 1. If we need more decimal places adding them would be trivial for the devs working on the protocol

What do you mean whose expense? Banks PAY the FDIC for insurance, so if a bank fails, the FDIC can refund deposits. Was that your question?

Not quite, I have the 4GB in the dorm cause my friend brought it, there's enough room for updates + the free halo: reach maps, but not much else. Probably couldn't buy extra maps if I wanted to. You can use any flash drive as an HDD now, though.

Not obvious to me, please explain if you aren't too exasperated with my stupidity. Jesus Christ.
What you described with the $1000 is the opposite scenario, in which your money becomes less valuable.
If somebody loses BTC everyone else's BTC become more valuable.
One big difference I see between the two scenarios is that fiat becomes devalued when the government prints more of it (obviously there are other reasons it can happen, but this one is most relevant). The government has an incentive to do this, therefor it will happen to a large degree.
There is an (obvious) incentive for people or companies to NOT lose private keys. The majority of people with any significant amount of BTC will take steps in order to prevent losing them, which is why I don't think lost BTC will ever pose a serious threat.

Yeah I understand what you mean, thanks for explaining!

Right, customers are footing at least part of the bill, likely in the form of lower interest rates, but in return they have their deposit ensured. What's the problem?

@_date: 2015-01-05 16:16:22
1BTC fee? Why? The best outcome is that the transaction gets included in the next block which isn't hard, a whole coin is many many times overkill
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:44:01
Explain why it is not ideal instead of saying it over and over. I think not proving solvency is much much less ideal.

Awful how?
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:53:49
Not quite..there are reasons that &gt;32MB blocks would be more difficult.
Not sure if you have any programming experience, but variables can only take on certain values. For example, changing the limit could mean using a long integer instead of a short integer, as you have to store larger values. It may sound like a simple change but it can have some wide reaching implications.
@_date: 2013-06-02 01:28:17
but how long does bitspend take to receive and place the order?
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:38:13
Customer protection comes at a cost. Whenever you use a credit card/paypal/whatever, you are paying for the labor and costs associated with chargebacks for people who aren't careful where they spend their money.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:39:41
This isn't the case though, BTC can be liquidated fairly quick, and real life examples (namely bitcoinstore) prove otherwise.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:43:17
hahaa it better, don't see why it wouldn't. I have 0.3 BTC and a bunch of listed items on there..

MtGox really fucked me over honestly. I put in a market order at $76, but it fucking bought them at $88.5. Some strange glitch where it didn't show me the correct market price? Oh well, probably made a tiny bit of profit.

Yea Bitmit is really great, especially since they upgraded servers. A month ago it was a pain to use lol

lol..if bitcoin catches on at all adding a character to the standard font is a non-issue..better have something unused by another currency, much less confusing for when bitcoin is used worldwide.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:42:57
But the thing is, you are footing the bill for people who aren't careful (the people who order the empty box). I would rather order the $1000 computer, doing my research about the store and taking the small risk than order the $1100 computer risk free. For someone who is very careful about where they spend their money, the lack of risk isn't worth the $100.

Bitmit is a bitcoin version of ebay, but with MUCH lower fees. I highly recommend it, the escrow system works really well.
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:27:33
Cool, but entering private keys is no fun, any chance of a version that has QR codes for both?
@_date: 2013-08-05 05:19:43
Not 100% on how the coins work, but couldn't the seller write down the code, then withdraw the BTC after the seller receives the coin? (possibly months later to avoid paypal dispute)
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:51:12
If you want BTC really fast just use bitinstant, you put in an order, go to walmart/cvs/wherever, and pay in cash.
My MTGOX voucher was in my account by the time I got home.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:36:07
I haven't had any issues.. But yeah its a strange site with quirks.. Like you can't press enter to login, it will say wrong pass unless you click "log in". Strange stuff.

I was seriously considering it as well, in fact I only bought back in (sold at $67) day before yesterday at $71 :(

Dividends go into your Bitfunder account, and can from there be transferred to your weexchange account, and from there to your address.
For some reason Bitfunder does all BTC transactions through weexchange, theres no fee, waiting, or verification, it's just a bit annoying.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:09:44
Mine Litecoins, currently about twice as profitable as BTC, a week ago it was 4x as profitable.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:50:57
You are missing the genious..every coin can be tracked, and because if this, whether or not a coin is "colored" can be verified absolutely.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:11:19
Not sure why you feel that way, were the people that invested at $10/coin disappointed?
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:53:54
Thats the point.. If it was locked to one address other people couldn't steal it since it would just go to your address..

I'm doing neither, I'm buying stock in a company/operation 
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:57:11
agreed. It pisses me off how personally people take it when you sell your coins..It's not a god damned charity, this is how currency works, if there's a bubble it's going to tank, and not selling is a bad financial move.
@_date: 2013-06-02 00:57:01
Although many have had trouble with it lately, I was able to get Bitcoins same day with cash with Bitinstant (actually I got MtGox credit, but converting that to BTC is easy).
Unfortunately you can't use a card since CC transactions are reversible, making it too risky for sellers. For your wallet, I highly suggest setting one up on Blockchain.info. Unlike other web wallets, they only store your keys encrypted, meaning if it got hacked you could still get your BTC/they wouldn't be stolen.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:30:16
The price could just as easily drop, then you end up with 5.1BTC

@_date: 2013-03-27 21:01:09
Never heard of btcbuy, but Bitmit is no hassle, you make an account, no personal info needed, find a good seller, and send the BTC to the address it gives you. I looked at the prices on btcbuy and the markup isn't too bad, but like I said I have never used it.

it's coordinated..haven't you seen the pics of hundreds (thousands?) of orders created within within a couple seconds all for 0.00001 BTC? That is NOT trading. That is DDoS
This happens AFTER the DDoSers have sold out all their coins. After this everyone starts to panic sell, which acounts for the crazy trade volume.
Disclaimer: I have no insider info, but this is the most likely explanation and seems obvious to me.

No the people doing this are doing it for money, they sell all their btc, tank the price with ddos, then rebuy way lower. I wish I was in on it, they must be making a killing..

I can't believe coinabul is going to take the moral low road and tarnish their arguably good image for ~$3.5k.
They spent all this time building up a business/image, and they are throwing it away trying to weasel their way out of paying out on an insurance policy THEY SOLD TO A FUCKING CUSTOMER. He fucking paid extra for insurance! It's not his god damned responsibility to research the insurance company that coinabul uses, it's coinabul's responsibility and they clearly fucked up big.

The only reason I need to log in is so I can withdraw to Btc-e, I'm done with MtGox's bullshit. I have like 4 BTC so I don't need the huge trade volume. Plus with Litecoin's recent explosion btc-e is a more useful exchange anyway.

Yeah, it's what merchants did thousands of years ago too, trading.. I don't really see your point. I'm not a merchant, so I wouldn't really have a good avenue to sell my cards for BTC, that's what the sub is for.
It's basically the bitcoin market subreddit, just specifically for MTG cards. I'm not claiming it's a revolutionary or original idea, just a useful one.

Well, I don't think this involves any change in protocol..just added functionality to clients..
The reason to use the bitcoin protocol even if you are trusting a third party is all the other reasons bitcoin is great (lack of trust isn't the only one) such as:
* Irreversability
* Zero trust between buyer and seller, just issuer
* Anonymous
* Fast
* Cheap
* Send to anywhere in the world
What part don't you see the value in? With this functionality, stocks or gold or non BTC currencies could be sent using the already established and util bitcoin protocol 
edit: One service I already use which would benefit greatly from this is Bitfunder (stock trading platform for BTC services). With this I could have total control over my stocks (still having to trust the stock-issuer) even if Bitfunder were to die.
