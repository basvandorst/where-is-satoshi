I saw the message disappear temporarily, maybe just keep checking?
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:05:42
Yeah that's fairly consistent with what I had in mind, no more than maybe $20 at a time.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:11:33
Definitely interested

Not in a meaningful way, no matter how many coins you get they get $635 and you spend $635. Coinbase doesn't have any incentive to perform the transaction at any particular time.

Be careful you don't get scammed by someone forcing a refund on PayPal.
I'd totally buy from you but I'm not looking to invest $250 right now.

I could be mistaken but I think you could import it on blockchain.info

It's money. Buy it, work for it, beg, or steal it.

Yeah having just started with Bitcoin and looking at faucets, anything larger than 0.00000100 BTC is beyond me.

As far as I can tell, yes. But you're buying in USD, not BTC. So if you want to invest $20, tell coinbase you want $20 worth of BTC. On Friday you'll get how ever many BTC $20 buys you.

I'm in for $20 of you want to give an exchange rate to BTC for your service.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:00:17
I'm definitely interested..
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:21:10
Sounds good
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:43:33
They made it pretty clear that you would get the amount of bitcoin equal to what you paid in USD when they finally processed your buy.

I canceled my pending order to do the same and the delay message reappeared..
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:17:58
That's up to you I suppose. I'm fine with bitstamp though.
