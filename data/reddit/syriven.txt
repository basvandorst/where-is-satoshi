Bitcoin has a lot of good ideas, and a lot of people think something *like* Bitcoin is inevitable. I always tell people: invest some small amount, whatever you wouldn't mind losing, into Bitcoin. $10, $100, whatever your budget easily allows.

Have you considered using an individual Bitcoin address and QR code for each exhibit, so that patrons can tip whichever exhibits they like the best?
Depending on how involved you want to get, it might be a simple thing to attach a camera to a raspberry pi, then allow patrons to borrow these devices as "tipping guns". These would be usable by people even if they don't know what bitcoin is, especially if the front desk facilities an initial deposit with fiat money. At the end of their stay, they would return the device and could collect any unused money in a similar way.

I've done the bulk of the work by myself, but I had a lot of help with the netvend api from I'd love to have some friends who program! I myself am not a professional programmer, and I haven't been able to find anyone (other than who's been willing to work on this with me without me being able to pay them.
The concept is open-source, so I don't plan to make money off of this directly. However, I expect netvend to be a powerful tool in monetizing things in general, and I think there will be a lot of opportunities that come from being at ground-zero when the momentum starts to build.
An app would be great! At the moment, there's only a Python api for netvend, so I don't think there's any way to get a netvend app. However, building an api for another language isn't too monumental of a task (all it needs is to be able to sign messages with a Bitcoin keypair and make http requests), so it might not be long before we see an api that will allow app development.

Good question! $1

I see coinflow and netvend as the first of many--more of a type of tool than a brand of one.
Chances are good that specific coinflow *clients* will have different (and likely, catchier) names, and "coinflow" will refer to the *network* that those clients interact with.
Similarly, I think we'll see several different "netvend servers" in the future, and again, these will each probably have their own name.
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:45:49
Oh. Well, that's what I thought at first, but then I couldn't find any evidence. I removed it, thinking that I'd misread stuff.

Thanks man! The final prize pool is now $201!
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:34:49
First of all, since the whole thing is open-source, you can call it whatever you like ;)
The reason I like coinflow is because of the way content is aggregated and filtered, as discussed in the [post from 8 months ago]( Basically, when I see a post I like, I can tip it. This makes all of my friends more likely to see the post. They can tip it, and the cycle continues. So, content rises based on how the coins flow, and while a given piece of content rises in popularity, the poster of the content is receiving those tips directly.
That's not to say that some dude with a lot of money can shoot his post up to the front page, because that dude's expenditures will only affect the feeds of *people who've tipped him*.
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:53:15
There isn't yet a way to directly fetch fees from the server.
Tips always cost the same amount (as they always require the same amount of work for the server): 5 mSat (mSat = milli-satoshis, or 1/1000 satoshi)
Posts cost a base fee (3 mSat) plus more based on the size (0.1 mSat per byte)
Queries cost a base fee (1 mSat), a fee based on processing time (0.01 per second), and a fee based on how much data is returned (0.001 mSat per returned byte). Having said that, every query I've run *so far* has come out to just barely above the base fee of 1 mSat.
It's possible to set a max fee for the query command, as this one is less predictable than the rest.
To put all of this in perspective, a single penny would pay for:
- Over **300,000 tip fees** (5 mSat per tip)
- Up to about **16 MB of data storage** (3 mSat per post + 100 uSat per byte)
- About **1,500,000 simple queries** (1 mSat per query + 10 mSat per second of execution + 1 uSat per byte of data returned)

At the moment, I'm gearing my writing toward the tech crowd, because that's what I need to bring it all to the next step.
Honestly, I think the bulleted list I have in the OP is a pretty good summary. I know not all the points are palatable to the layman, but some are, and the others are hard to distill further without misrepresenting them or expanding them quite a bit.
Don't worry--by the time we have a working application prototype, we'll also have a more user-friendly way of explaining what this is all about.

In fact, either today or tomorrow, I should have a wiki up. The wiki's going to have everything I've written on the concept. I'll also be writing a few articles on how to make a social network on netvend, what I think it will look like, etc. I'll send you a message when it's up.
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:49:22
I haven't heard of that. It could be something to look into when the time comes to move to a different server.
At the moment, netvend is just hosted on an amazon AWS instance, mostly because it's nearly free at no use, and scales with increased usage. This aligns nicely with the netvend fee structure.
As soon as coinflow and netvend gain some momentum, netvend will probably be tried on several different kinds of platforms.

I think coinflow will be a combination of the perks of content aggregators (like reddit) *and* social networks (like facebook).
Imagine a 'tip' button that functions the same way as a 'like' button. One click, and you're done. The tip will be some user-set value. The important thing to note is that this value can be a thousandth of a cent, and in that case will be more of an expression than an actual payment.

It's very difficult to summarize netvend itself--imagine trying to explain the Internet to someone, but without being able to show them any websites. However, [this post]( is a good writeup of the social network potential of netvend. That post talks about the kinds of tools we'll see begin to be built, as people start to learn how to use netvend.

For what it's worth, I dropped out of college to pursue bitcoin stuff, and I was only about a year and a half away from graduating with a mechanical engieering degree. I don't regret it, and I've never been more confident and excited about my future.
Just another data point for your consideration =)
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:38:12
Eventually, absolutely.
For now, if you have some experience with cryptographic functions, then we could use a Java api.
The hardest part of creating a netvend api is actually signing the messages cryptographically. It's harder to find the tool than you might think. If you're interested in trying, check out the source code to the python api, and email or message me with any quetsions.

My project [netvend]( which I recently announced, uses public addresses and cryptographic signatures for user authentication. It's meant to be a framework for other tools, including my *also* [recently announced plan]( to make a social network based on it.
Maybe our projects have something in common, or could complement each other in some way.
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:39:32
Specific coinflow clients could easily be called something different. But I also think that the name coinflow will make a bit more sense when people can see the interface.
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:45:03
In addition, while Myspace, Facebook, and Google+, are effectively different implementations of the same design, coinflow will offer advantages that other social networks simply don't even come close to having. See the bulleted list in OP. Many of these are unheard of on any existing social network or platform.
What did google+ *really* have that was new? Personally, I was rooting for it mostly because it *wasn't Facebook*--that might as well have been their slogan: "Google+: it's not Facebook!"

As I said in response to another comment, the names netvend and coinflow probably *won't* be the names of the actual tools that users will use. Netvend is the first of a specific kind of server, and coinflow is the name I'm putting to sum of all of the clients that use netvend in a social way.
By the time we have an interface, I suspect that interface will have a name other than coinflow.

I personally don't mind small tips, but on the other hand, if it ends up being worth less than a cent it doesn't really mean anything to me either...
Altcoin tips, on the other hand, are a bit more of a hassle. A small bitcoin tip just adds to my balance, but with an altcoin I would have to go through quite a bit more of a process to actually use it like normal bitcoin.

At the moment, I think it's more important to get everything working and tested with a community, and trying to integrate it with other in-development things will just make that harder.
Having said that, though, I agree that eventually netvend could probably go very nicely with things like this. Just a matter of time.
@_date: 2014-05-18 03:58:08
**Tying it all together:**
Netvend serves as a platform with many of the characteristics you want. With a bit more work, tools and interfaces can be built (and are being built) that will work as a portal to netvend, enabling the community to discuss and aggregate ideas and content much more efficiently and transparently than ever before. Content is organized based on the tips it receives from the people the user has already indicated they trust and value, rather than by exploitable upvote systems or a closed group of individuals.
@_date: 2014-01-18 04:23:41
We'll have to agree to disagree =)
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:32:21
No need to be sorry! Your points seem valid.
I never intended to make this version of netvend perfect. It would have taken much more time to do so, and one man alone (when that man is not a professional programmer) probably couldn't do that anyway. My goal was to get a working prototype, so I can begin to build applications that prove its unique utility. When people start to understand the purpose of the overall design, I welcome any experts who can do a better job than I can.
In a similar vein, the server is currently hosted on an amazon EC2 instance, which I'm sure is not the best choice in the long run. But I'm an even worse administrator than I am a programmer, and I'm sure that someone more suited to the task can host the server better than I can, with much less effort, when the time comes.

Sorry, you're right. That didn't make much sense. Obviously, open source projects have to choose a single name like any other projects.

It's a little sad that you're getting downvoted. I agree--the dogecoin community does seem much more willing to tip for things they appreciate.

@_date: 2014-09-24 03:02:14
It depends on your definition of "easy". The fact that a 10-year-old can do it easily doesn't actually mean that a corporation can.
Consider what a corporation *is*. It's a large group of people, whose decision-making process always must involve several people. Bitcoin is easy to adopt for certain individuals, but it's difficult for a corporation. It doesn't even really *work* like traditional money, which means that to really digest Bitcoin, it will take a lot of effort and focus for something as big as Steam. How do they fit it into their existing model? Someone is going to have to *explain* this to every single accountant and anyone else involved in financial planning. Explaining Bitcoin to *one person* is difficult enough--can you imagine having to educate a whole *company* of them?
Further, Bitcoin is far from politically neutral, at least in terms of perception. Steam **must** ask the question "how will accepting Bitcoin be taken by our customers?", and it's simply not an easy question to answer. They don't really lose anything by waiting, and we've seen that many companies (there are exceptions) don't exactly gain much (in terms of additional revenue) by choosing to accept it.
@_date: 2014-09-30 03:05:51

I'm talking like a programmer, because right now, programmers are what I need.
Users don't have to care about this advantage directly. Coinflow will begin with unique advantages, far beyond what other social networks offer. And when someone has an idea for an improvement, that idea won't have to be heard about and approved by some centralized group: it will be in the hands of the open-source community, to use or not, as they see fit.

Read your first line. You want to effectively silence what *you deem* trolls.
First of all, are they trolls? Do you really think that much diatribe comes from someone just wanting to russle our jimmies? however much you disagree with them, are not trolls--they're people who really do disagree with us. You can't slap the "troll" label on someone who consistently disagrees with you just so you can ignore them (well, you can, but that's stupid). They might be haters, but they're not trolls.
Personally, I like the buttcoin link bot. It is a good indication of what sees as our greatest failures. And you know what? Sometimes, they're a little bit right. Other times, they clearly don't get it. Either way, it's *information* on what "the haters" think, and each time I can downvote the link bot just like any other piece of content on reddit.

Technically, netvend is not a decentralized network--it's a centralized server. It just achieves many of the benefits of decentralized networks through other means.
As one example, while the blockchain is difficult to corrupt *directly*, it's a little different with netvend. In the event that the netvend server was compromised, the corruption would become immediately evident. This is because each piece of the netvend history is signed by each user's client, and stored transparently for any interested party to validate at any time.
One of the cool things about coinflow is that anyone who wants to can create an coinflow interface, or write their own from scratch. You guys actually don't have to depend on me being an amazing coder, because the development of the tool is open to anyone.

I would agree that the option to make data transient is a feature that a netvend-*like* tool should offer. However, netvend is meant to be more of a permanent history tool--this is better for reputation tracking and building webs-of-trust.
I think that as netvend takes off, we'll see a lot of offshoots, with the common thread being simply a server that charges microfees for each request. I'm sure one of the very first new types of netvend-like servers will offer a transient data storage option, where instead of paying one time for one public data upload, you pay to *rent* an address, then update that address when you want to.

Actually, this is not technically decentralized. Netvend is a centralized server, that attains the perks of a decentralized system through other means.
Netvend (and therefore coinflow) stores its data transparently, in such a way that any interested party can confirm for themselves that no funny business is going on.
Whereas the blockchain is difficult to corrupt *in the first place*, netvend is not quite the same. Rather, *if* netvend/coinflow were compromised, it would become immediately obvious to the clients, which would simply refuse to trust the server until it was restored. This is because the entire database is supported by cryptographic signatures from users, which support whatever action the database *claims* they performed. These signatures are unfakeable, and can be checked by any party at any point, as the database is open to anyone.
@_date: 2014-10-01 18:05:41
:D I'm glad I could have such an impact!
I'm actually working on netvend, a backend which can be used to build a social-network-*type* tool that uses voluntary tips (called "pulses") to prioritize content. So, if I'd pulsed you credit on that kind of network, my client would start to prioritize things *you've* pulsed in turn. This "pulsenet" would be defined entirely by the user, and would be a filter to effectively present new, valuable content over spam.

First, know that I don't think Bitcoin is any kind of scheme or scam.
But here's why others do:
- Some people do get rich quick.
- Some people lose tons of money quickly.
- Reasonable questions are met with answers that are complex at best, and often confusing.
- It looks like "another e-cash", which historically has failed every time.
- Many of its proponents often seem radical or even a little crazy when it comes to Bitcoin.
There are probably other points that I can't think of.
The thing about Bitcoin is that it sounds too good to be true, and to understand *why* it can work, a lot of research and mental digestion is necessary. Most of us here have backgrounds in something that has put us ahead in understanding Bitcoin: economics, computer science, cryptography, etc.
Most people just don't have the time to look into every idea that sounds too good to be true. This is the Internet--there are lots of crazy ideas out there that promise the moon. For most people, there is no way to immediately distinguish Bitcoin from any other crazy idea, and from their point of view it's a simple choice not to spend any more time on one more crazy idea.

No, not yet. There are lots of tools to build, and the community has to learn a lot. But I feel like we're getting closer, consistently.
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:16:43
Yes, the backend is centralized. However, it achieves many benefits of a decentralized system by it's design, and is much cheaper, faster, and simpler to use as a result.
In the same way the Bitcoin blockchain is signed by each sender of each transaction, netvend's database is built from individual actions, each signed by the user or agent that initiated the action. In this way, we get the trustless nature of the blockchain.
And although a nefarious third party could take down netvend, the database is transparent and open to anyone, as well as the source code. Because the database is self-authenticating, netvend can be started up again, with the any old backup anyone has, and the community can instantly verify it as legitimate. So, although the server can be taken down, it can't really be taken down *permanently*: it's just too easy for anyone to set up again.
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:39:28
I will agree that this *has* been a challenge for typical networks. However, I would argue that Coinflow has a very unique advantage:
Let's say that, at some point, Coinflow is working and has a small pool of users. If any one of these users has a cool idea for a feature, and has the skill to implement it, they can do so. Their own version of the Coinflow client will still have access to the same community--even though they're using a modified client. This applies even if they write their own client from scratch, with a completely different idea of how the interface should be designed.
Facebook evolves as fast as a small, closed group of developers can build it, but Coinflow (as with all netvend applications) can develop as fast as its whole userbase can build it.

$50 Congratulations to skeeto for winning the $50 prize of my contest. The BitTorrent tracker submission is a great example of what I was hoping to get. It is a simple and straightforward script that uses netvend for a real world application. It helps to solve the issue of how to share larger files through netvend, avoiding the MySQL size limits.
I also want to apologize for this late response, but life has thrown me a few curve balls and I was forced to face the fact that I have not done a good enough job of explaining netvend. Skeeto's submission was the only one I got.

I would love to help you set this up. I'll write some thoughts here, and if you're interested to hear more, please PM me!
The first and easiest step would be to implement this kind of thing on your web page. First we would simply generate a Bitcoin address for each exhibit, then put that address (and a QR code, as this is easier for some users) with each exhibit's page. This would be very easy to set up, and would immediately make exhibit-specific donations possible from people who already have and know how to use Bitcoin.
The above technique could be augmented to be more friendly to those who aren't familiar with Bitcoin, although this would take more work. I can give you more details about possible ways to implement this, if you're interested.
But to me, the most interesting application is the one I've already mentioned: hand actual patrons a device that can scan QR codes and instantly tip any exhibit they like, as they actually walk through the museum. When you combine this with knowledgeable front-desk staff, this device could be used by any patron without having to know anything about Bitcoin.
I would be happy to get you started on any of these applications.

Yes, this could happen. I've heard a few other respected Bitcoin community members put it this way: it's not that Bitcoin is automatically anonymous; it's that, with the right tools and preparation, it *can* be.
For the sake of argument, imagine The Government has identified your public address as belonging to you, but you would like to send some bitcoin to your friend Jim without The Government knowing who you sent it to.
What you'd use is a mixer. A mixer is a person or computer program who will accept a transaction, along with an encrypted final address you want the money to go to. You send the transaction to the mixer, along with Jim's address encrypted so that only the mixer can access that information. A few other people use the mixer in a similar way. The mixer then sends the transactions on their way--in this case, your money ends up going to Jim.
The key is that no one except the mixer and you can ever find out that "your" money went *to Jim*. Yes, outside observers can see that you sent it to the mixer, and that later the mixer sent bitcoin to Jim. But no one can prove that the money that went to Jim actually came from you, because the transaction of you -&gt; mixer is one of many the mixer received, and the transaction of mixer -&gt; Jim is one of many the mixer sent. As long as the mixer has enough traffic, avoids sending exactly the same amount it received, and is careful in a few other ways, nothing can be proven. Plausible deniability is maintained.
Of course, this depends on the mixer not sharing its information. But if you're worried about this, you can create, say, 10 extra anonymous addresses, mix your transaction 10 different times, and use 10 different mixers. Then, all 10 mixers would have to share information to know that you sent bitcoin to Jim.

Many offers are more contracting work than a steady job, but it's still a great way to begin building contacts in the Bitcoin business sphere.
Maybe it's dried up since then, but if you can even get two or three jobs there, a good quick contracting job can be a really good investment. You'll make money, and figure out how to market and sell your skills better.

There aren't any buyers on the sidelines anymore.
People who could have been convinced from hearing that Microsoft is accepting Bitcoin, have already been convinced. The question "where can I spend Bitcoin" is still *essentially* unchanged: "a small, exclusive list". The fact that Microsoft now accepts Bitcoin doesn't actually change that answer much.
The people that are left--the vast majority of the world--will change their mind when they can go out *today*, and find a *local business* that accepts Bitcoin. That day is coming, but we're not there yet. One day, Wal Mart will accept Bitcoin, and the answer to the question above becomes "groceries". Tesoro -&gt; "gas"; McDonalds -&gt; "food"; etc.
For most people, Bitcoin doesn't work like real money, because there isn't a local place they can spend it. That will change one day, but it hasn't yet.

For example, posts will have "tip" buttons right beside it, and when writing a post, encryption will be as easy as one or two extra clicks.

Here's my opinion about where all this hate comes from: **From the outside, Bitcoin has all the hallmarks of a scam.** When you get more into it, you learn that it's not, but that's not how it appears at first.
Here are some things people learn about Bitcoin. Often, these can be the *first and only* things people learn about Bitcoin. Forget what you know about Bitcoin, and imagine your friend is telling you about some new thing he's excited about. He tells you:
- Some people have gotten ridiculously wealthy, very quickly.
- Other people have lost a large amount of money just as fast.
- Reasonable questions are met with answers that are complicated at best, and confusing at worst.
- Whether or not *you* will make money depends significantly on whether or not other people "buy in".
These admittedly true facts scream "SCAM!". Most people just accept that it is one, and move on.
Now, most of us here know that there's much more to it than that. But that "much more" part is not easy to explain to someone in short, easy-to-understand sentences. It's simply not possible to explain the blockchain, mining, proof of work, cryptography, and all the other pieces of Bitcoin in a simple way.
So, naturally, there is a large portion of people who've heard only the negatives of Bitcoin, and have decided it's a scam not worth getting into. You can't really blame them for this. How many of us already had a leg up, from knowing certain specifics about how computers, cryptography, or economics work? Most of us here, I'd bet. Most people don't have that advantage, and it's just not worth their time to invest a lot of thought into everything that looks like a scam. If it looks like a scam and sounds like a scam, it's a scam, end of story.
So, this huge portion of users who've decided Bitcoin is a scam keeps hearing that more people are "falling for it". If you *knew* thing X was a scam, and your friends were falling for it, wouldn't you be upset? Wouldn't you try to express your disagreement wherever possible? Can't you see yourself filled with a helpless rage as more and more people fall for what is *obviously* a huge scam?
Again, we here know that there's more to the story. But I think most of us had to take at least a solid month before *really* feeling comfortable in that knowledge. It's a huge chunk to process, because it's so fundamentally different from the currencies we're used to.
**TL;DR:** The rage against Bitcoin comes from the fundamentally misguided, yet totally understandable, belief that Bitcoin is a scam. Not everyone is willing to spend the time it takes to understand how it's *not* a scam, and if they don't, that's their right and their loss.

Good video for getting *basically* the right idea into someone's head, if they have no knowledge of the blockchain before hand.
One small issue I have with it: the blockchain can't really be thought of as a "crowd-sourced cloud". Or at least, not an efficient one. In terms of *transactions*, Bitcoin is cheap. In terms of *storing data*, it's prohibitively expensive. The very nature of centralized and decentralized networks is such that using a decentralized one costs orders of magnitude more, and we already have effective centralized cloud servers.
This actually relates to my own project, netvend, quite a bit. It's what we call "pseudo-trustless", and offers cloud storage and retrieval in a transparent, auditable, open way. [The whitepaper]( if anyone's interested. Section 2.2 in particular relates to what I'm talking about.

Maybe I should have said pseudonymous, rather than anonymous. Netvend (and therefore coinflow) uses Bitcoin keypairs to identify its agents and users.
Clients can access coinflow through Tor if they want, and netvend will serve the request as long as the cryptographic signature lines up.
@_date: 2014-04-16 07:29:01
Unfortunately, the way the system is built won't really support that kind of growth. One of the biggest perks of netvend is that *all* agents have equal access, and there are no shares--just a neutral database built from users' expression. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:04:02
I'm working on a project specifically designed to capture this mechanic, and offer its potential in an open a way as possible. I've written about the netvend project here before. The social application of netvend yields a system which I've begun to call a **"pulsenet": a network of voluntary tips viewed as individualized upvotes.**
Part of netvend's structure is that it offers a **pulse** command to any client, which is essentially a financial payment that costs less than a Satoshi to send, and which can handle ultra-small values. A **pulsenet** is the history of voluntary tips among users on a secure, transparent, ultra-low-friction, irreversible payment system. **By analyzing this pulsenet, clients can follow real value through the network to find good content.** The pulsenet would look different from user to user, because the pulsenet is defined primarily by the *user's* pulsing habits.
On a system that functions like this, users will find that **a pulse is both a financial tip and a sincere upvote**, perhaps only a few millisatoshis, that nevertheless can pile up for good content creators. Each pulse would add definition to a user's (and the network's) pulsenet, and each client can mine the pulsenet in any way the developer can think up.
We're seeing a new culture emerge with this tipping mechanic. Netvend is designed as the convergence of many recent trends, and the social network application relies heavily on the same thing that's got everyone.
In the wake of all this changetip buzz, I'm working to have a concise, updated description of the social application of netvend within the next couple of days. For a *very* out-of-date one, see [this]( I'm also hoping to prove the pulsenet concept with a reddit changetip scraper bot I'm working on, and shortly after release a netvend pulsenet management/demonstration tool.

Hmm. What I meant is that the hard part of the *implementation* was done.
But I also think that growing a userbase won't be as hard as some people assume. The important difference with this project is that the backend is open to any developer or client, and can be accessed simply and without signup. I think this will lead to rapid development of not only one tool, but a network of many tools.
This includes, by the way, tools that mirror other popular social networks or websites.

This isn't something everyone can do, but:
I own a Piper Bitcoin wallet printer, which is basically just a Raspberry Pi that prints cold wallet keypairs out on demand. I keep it in my car, and I can bring it out if someone shows interest, and print them off one "secure, cold wallet" (which I still have to explain).
I can then say "as long as you only load btc *into* this, it will remain secure. Once you send *any* of it somewhere,  it becomes insecure, but you can send any amount to a *new*, secure cold wallet."
I then usually put a little on their smartphone if they have one, so they can get experience actually using/handling bitcoin, in addition to holding most of their bitcoin in a secure cold wallet.

As I said elsewhere, coinflow will probably turn out to refer more to the *network* of social clients, rather than any specific client itself. By the time we have a first coinflow application, the application itself could well be called something else.

Not decentralized--but open-source, transparent, cryptographically secure, and independently verifiable? Netvend is the beginning to this. I've written about [the social network application of netvend]( and just recently I was able to finish and announce [the completion of netvend beta](
We don't necessarily need a decentralized application, to build an open system that requires no trust. Netvend offers a lot of the benefits of a decentralized system, without having the high financial and developmental cost of one. As a social network and content platform is built on it, these characteristics will trickle up into the application.

You're right--tools can come out to make secure storage easier, but fundamentally, the user must have some level of operations security awareness. I wasn't really aware of "operations security" as a phrase until I read your comment, but it's exactly what makes this such a difficult problem.
We can't really get away from the fact that the user must *somehow* protect one piece of digital information--in this case, a private key. We can make tools that make it easier, but in the end only a human is capable of actually planning and executing some set of "operations security" strategy.

I would argue that the truth is a little bit of both, and actually better than both.
Parts of the market will shun dirty money some of the time, depending on the circumstances and each person or organization's personal beliefs.
If someone extorts Bitcoin through a bomb threat or ransom note, those coins will be "very" dirty. Almost no one would be willing to accept them, and certain transparent blacklist services with good reputations can step in to make this market expression very easy for others.
On the other hand, if the money is only "dirty" in the sense that it was made by selling weed, then chances are good that almost the entire market won't care.
And if it's something a little more complex, then each market node can decide for themselves whether the coins are "too dirty" to accept. Would you accept money made via prostitution? What about via the sale of child porn? With colored coins and increased blockchain analysis/transparency, you make the choice yourself.

In regards to your question about using MySQL, let me start by saying that I'm not an expert administrator, and I don't know a ton about databases.
The current version of netvend is meant to be a prototype, and MySQL is simply what I'm familiar with. It works enough to begin building with. The overall design of netvend itself isn't that complex, and at some point, this version of netvend will be a distant predecessor to whatever comes after. I wouldn't be surprised if the new iterations change many things about the implementation.

I know it seems like a contradiction, but there's a reason I'm making such a ludicrous pair of claims. See the first quoted section of [this post](
Basically, it's not that spam won't find its way onto the network, but rather that it won't ever be exposed to users, By following the trails of tips outward from a user's agent, a client can be nearly guaranteed to not only avoid all spam, but further prioritize subjectively valuable content.

The moment the accused transparently submits evidence for their innocence, the community would back off. Imagine if Jordon had revealed, say, his own record of emails, which revealed evidence proving Andrew had made it all up.


No. First of all, a post without proof won't get any traction. Further, it's easier to prove the truth of something than make up lies and all the evidence necessary to back up those lies. For every lie the scammer makes up, he must prove it; for each piece of evidence they take the time to fabricate, the attacked party can simply respond transparently, which takes much less energy and time anyway. A scammer only needs to be proven a liar once, and all of his claims are suspect.

If I understand your description correctly, you are asking for a software platform to effectively replace the Bitcoin Foundation, and which has the following characteristics:
- 100% transparent
- neutral; not controlled by a centralized system
- open to anyone
- facilitates paid bounties for good work
I believe my project netvend could serve as an excellent foundation for not just one, but potentially many projects that fit with what you're describing. A prototype of netvend is already finished, functional, and open to the public. There is a technical writeup of netvend [here]( and a description of the features it facilitates for social uses [here](
Any tool built on netvend would inherit the four bulletted characteristics listed above--I'll explain how further down. A netvend tool built specifically for your needs would provide a much better, "purer" alternative to the Bitcoin Foundation, which the community can use to both make decisions and build software. The tool would be open to anyone, and would allow for a truly democratic method of selecting good contributions out of the sea of submitted content. The system would be effectively immune to "corrupt" political influence, and rely only on the aggregate actions of the community to determine which content floats to the top.
Some of the following features are already built and active, and others are in development. I'll separate the two after I describe the idea.
**The client:**
Imagine a client that connects to a provably transparent and neutral server, where all activity is automatically signed cryptographically by those using the software. Further, all users of the client already have some bitcoin deposited into the server, which allows for one-click tips. These tips are tracked internally (but still transparently), which allows three important things: the tips are instant; they can reference any netvend post as a memo or paid request; and the tips can handle values down to 1/1000th of a satoshi.
With this client, you submit a piece of content to netvend (whether it's an idea, a piece of code, a question, or anything else). The first people to see this content will be those within one degree of separation from you: those who've chosen to follow you, or those who've already sent you a tip for something you posted before. Then, if any one of them likes your content enough to tip it (which, remember, can be as low as 1/1000 of a satoshi, and as easy as one click), the content will effectively travel through the network and be exposed to people within one degree of separation of *that* person. So, your content starts with the best audience imaginable (those who already like you) and spreads through the network based precisely on who has expressed their own approval of the content. Meanwhile, you will be receiving tips based on the popularity of your post, which you could then of course withdraw into Bitcoin and spend however you like.
This system allows new ideas to spread quickly, and at the same time, rewards the author of the content with tips directly determined by the users who make up the network. Looked at from the passive user's perspective, they have the power to participate in both popularizing *and funding* any idea they see pop up on their feed--whether with microcents or more. Furthermore, this means that any given user's feed is made up *primarily* from a network built out of the people they've tipped directly, secondarily by people those people have tipped, and so on. With every tip a user sends, they can further define what "their" network means, and therefore determine what kind of content they'll find.
**What's built:**
Netvend itself is already functional, although it's untested on an industrial scale. Netvend provides 100% provable transparency and neutrality as it is, using cryptographic signatures as described below, and facilitates the instant, sub-satoshi tips I mention, as well as arbitrary data uploads by any client. Any client can search, analyze, or filter any part of the database. The nuts and bolts of the idea all *work*, and we are beginning to build a [very basic client]( (feel free to download, try out, and/or fork!), to begin harnessing netvend's potential.
**What's not built:**
It's true that the client linked to in the previous paragraph allows the user to write and view posts, tip other users for content, and perform other basic actions. However, this is only the beginning to an initial set of interfaces and tools, each of which would expose more of netvend's potential in various user-friendly ways. For example, there isn't really a feed functionality yet, and tip-trail browsing (the mechanism I describe to find new content) is yet to be implemented.
**Netvend as the foundation for what's not built:**
As you can see, the client I linked to above is pretty basic. Keep in mind, though, that it's only been in development for less than a month, and is already capable of sending tips, making posts, participating in chat, and other basic actions. If you look at the code, you'll find that interfacing with netvend, while a bit unique, is actually extremely simple. A client can connect to netvend and make a post, run a query, or send a tip with only three lines of code--counting the import statement. Netvend automatically handles a huge bulk of the complications that typically come from such a project: fund handling, user logins, server setup, server funding, etc.
Another thing to note about netvend is that clients don't need *approval* to access netvend. Netvend itself defines what an agent can do (post, tip, or query), so there's no need to limit who has access to it. This means that *anyone* can download the client's code, change it to add a feature, and *immediately begin testing and using their modified client*. This is a huge advantage over any other open-source project that requires a server, where anyone who wants to try out a new feature must somehow set up their own server.
This same characteristic of netvend allows independent clients to access the same history and community, and potentially use or contribute to it in different ways. Imagine if Facebook allowed users to use any client anyone could dream up. With Facebook's configuration, this would cause several problems. However, netvend's characteristics allow this to become a reality: there aren't any passwords to steal, and all the data on the server is open for anyone to read anyway. Therefore, anyone who has a new idea for how to utilize netvend is *immediately* free to do so.
At the same time, netvend's underlying structure and api guarantee things like infinite, unerasable, unfakeable reputation tracking, secure user funds, and neutral content aggregation.
So, to sum up the past four paragraphs, netvend allows a development and software platform that is *open* in much grander terms than anything else out there. If any one user has an idea for a new way to use netvend, and the knowledge and skills to implement the feature, they can do so without any approval from anyone else. Netvend is built from the ground up to facilitate this kind of thing safely and intelligently, which will lead to unrestrained development of useful tools.
**How netvend delivers its promises:**
**Netvend is transparent.** All data uploaded to or tips sent with netvend is signed by the uploading agent, and this command and its signature is stored transparently on netvend, free for any interested party to view or verify. Because passwords aren't used, and because deposits are held on a separate server, this allows netvend to be **100% transparent.** There is nothing (aside from root passwords and other obvious exceptions like that) that the server has to "hide" from users.
**Netvend is neutral.** After depositing any amount of Bitcoin into netvend, an agent has access to the entire server, at the cost of **milli**satoshis per command. To put the scale of this into perspective, an agent that queries netvend for information every second would cost about **$0.15 over one year**. This is virtually free--but the important thing here is that, because each command processed is compensated by a microfee, the server's operating costs are always paid for. There's no need for advertising to pay for the server (which would ruin the neutrality of the system). While there is technically a pay-wall, the pay-wall is **one-million times smaller than a Bitcoin transaction fee.** Because netvend is also transparent, and each command is stored with a signature, the neutrality of netvend can always be proven by any interested party.
**Netvend is open to anyone.** All a client needs is an agent with netvend credit, and the client can scan, search, and analyze the entire netvend database; post any arbitrary data under their public address; or send a tip to anyone. By using the tip-trail browsing method I mention above, new content always has a shot at becoming viral.
**Netvend facilitates tips, which determine content popularity.** There are only three commands, on the most basic level of netvend interaction; one of these commands is "tip". The potential comes from the fact that the tip history of netvend can be analyzed by any agent. This allows a client to search through the user's tips to find agents they've valued; then search through *their* tips to find who *they've* valued, and so on. This "tip trail" is not only an excellent tool for finding new, valuable content, but it also filters out all spam, and rewards tip-recipients with more exposure--and very likely, yet more tips from that additional exposure.

If you look at the third link in the group of links at the end of my post, there's a more in-depth explanation of how a program can access netvend.
Here's some code that would post something to netvend, at its current state. You'll need python 2.x and the netvend api, which is the second link in that group of links.
    import netvend
    
     an agent with the seed 'correct horse battery staple'
     agent has credit sitting on it already, meant for anyone to experiment with
    agent = netvend.Agent('correct horse battery staple', seed=True)
    
    response = agent.post('hello, netvend!')
And that's it. response will contain a dictionary with some information about your request, including the post id. you could use this post id in a tip, to reference it as a memo.

What the hell are you on about? You claim:
- the Internet is becoming more controlled 
- individual freedom from governments is decreasing 
- bitcoin is becoming more controlled. 
But none of this is backed up. It's just a bunch of pessimistic *claims*. The kind of shit someone would say at a bar to sound smart, without having to bother actually having an outlook that reflects reality.
Individual freedom has been increasing. Obviously. There is less outright slavery in the world. Democracy isn't perfect but it's better than monarchy. Today we argue about women's rights and legality of weed; used to be, we viewed those debates as extreme and presidents debated about the ethics of owning slaves. 
The Internet began as a government project. Today we have tons of blogs and decentralized news sources that routinely uncover and shine light on mistreatment of individuals. We have wikileaks. And beyond all that, we have the dark net, which reaches a new level of insulation from any kind of government interference. 
And where do you get the idea bitcoin is being controlled, in any way? It's a transparent system. You could argue for conspiracy theories, sure. But can you argue that nothing can stop people from donating bitcoin to support Ross Ulbright? Maybe there are powers trying to destroy and hamstring bitcoin. But I think it's more than a stretch to say that those powers are winning, or indeed, can win.

Seems to me that we're not seeing an "obama effect"--just the owner of the address (Snowden, or someone helping him?) moving money out and then back in.
This is his balance, not a direct measure of donations. The huge dropoff just before the "obama effect" label, we can assume, is because the funds were moved somewhere else.
Doesn't it seem a bit odd that the supposed "obama effect" increase almost directly matches that decrease? Doesn't it *also* seem odd that the supposed "obama effect" is basically vertical?

What you're saying about an army/marketplace of paid machines reminds me of a project I was pretty serious about for a while, netvend. [Here's](  a post I wrote about it a while ago.
Basically, any script could connect to the netvend server and send it signed commands to either send/receive money to/from another account, upload data, or read data. From this you could build any paid service, and have it operated by just a few lines of Python code. 
I stopped working on it since then, but I still think the idea is a good one and I want to return to it one day when I have some better ideas of how to get over its biggest obstacles.

@_date: 2013-05-14 22:09:38


I disagree. I think the discussion is different, and a community's nature of discussion alone *can* be used as a somewhat dependable indication of their future behavior. Simply put, a culture that talks about the price less probably cares about the price less. If we still cared about the price like we used to, then why isn't anyone talking about it? Why aren't posts about the price being upvoted?

@_date: 2013-09-21 21:29:21
That's a big part of the idea, yes.
The use of Bitcoins allows the whole thing to be used by automated tools much more easily than any other service that operates on fiat currency. This difference also allows the server to serve as many identities as its users want, regardless of how many people those identities come from, and signing up is as easy as making a deposit or receiving a tip from another account. There are a few other differences, which might be clearer in the technical writeup.
The fact that the database is transparent and signature-based means that no part of the database can be subversively affected without it becoming immediately obvious and provable. It also means that every bit of information has been signed by some identity, which can be a useful fact for those posting and for those browsing.
Finally, the money sending features *paired* with the database features is what really gives this thing potential. It allows one identity to send a *paid request* to another identity, where either identity may be automated, human-controlled, or some mixture. This should allow collaboration between different tools like we've never seen before--as soon as it gets the community to support it.
And that's where I'm stuck now. You said you don't expect many to understand it, and that's been one of my biggest headaches. It's very difficult to summarize the idea--if I try, I often find I've either reduced it to exciting promises without proof, or boring proof without promises.
My plan at the moment is to write a few more scripts for the service, since they're extremely easy to write, and make another post soon showing them off. A service which takes encrypted commands, waits for some specified time, then sends the decrypted commands itself, for example--it would be an extremely useful service for guaranteeing a user's anonymity, in the same way that mixers are useful to Bitcoin users. As soon as encryption is worked into the api, I believe this service would take less than a day to write. There are many other ideas I have for useful little simple tools to write--some of which might pay for and use the others, and most of which would be very easy and fast to write.
@_date: 2013-08-11 11:09:56
I think the user-controlled privacy is definitely a point that will be very easy to sell. I think the tipping is ultimately more exciting, but it's not quite as immediately obvious or easy to explain why.

The thing is, most people who are really *into* bitcoin--not just casual about it--believe that Ripple isn't much more than an attempt to harness enthusiasm about cryptocurrencies in order to profit.

@_date: 2013-08-12 05:23:18


I go into this issue in [this comment]( To summarize, the nature of the system makes it very easy to mirror, backup, and clone; and in the worst case scenario, the hidden server can return funds to users according to the last known balance for each user.


Well, it doesn't actually matter how many spammers are on the network. As I describe in [this comment]( a user will never see spam, since they (and those they have tipped) will never tip to a spambot in the first place.


Well yeah, duh. People don't like paying for anything. And yet somehow, grocery stores make money. It's not really a question of "are there fees?"; It's a question of "Are the fees worth the service?". If this network provides a significant set of features that others don't, I don't find it too hard to believe someone would pay a couple dollars for a year or two of use.

Retroshare is fine for what it does, but it does something different than this server would.
This server aims to be a blank slate, which you can put anything you want on it--which happens to include encrypted information. The clients themselves will have built-in encryption tools, and you could do it manually if you'd like to be extra paranoid.

As I said in the main post, users can still find new content. The client will follow tip-trails outward from their (or anyone else's) account to find new content that is guaranteed to not be spam. Better yet, it's going to show the most valued stuff before the less-valued stuff.
If no one ever tips anyone, the network will act like Facebook or Twitter--you only get info for those you choose to follow. If users do use tips, this will offer a mechanism for finding new content without encountering spam. The more users tip each other, the better this mechanism gets.


Phishing has been around forever. In this case, however, it's *impossible* for an attacker to pretend to be some other identity, because that attacker would have to prove to both the server and the community that they hold the private keys to whatever account they're trying to impersonate--which they can't (unless they actually steal the private keys, which is an inherent problem in all of crypto that will never entirely go away).


In the same way that the system avoids spam, the system will avoid any nefarious content, including links to viruses and the like. If I am following my friends, and I occasionally tip valuable content, how would any attacker (whether a spammer or virus-injector) inject himself into my feed?


I'm not sure what you mean by this.


It's trivial to move onto another site that *offers comparable services*. It's my contention that this type of network simply could not be offered for free. Charging tiny fees for each command removes the need to regulate or restrict activity, which means that developers and their bots can use the service just as easily as a "legitimate" user (this may sound dangerous, but again, I believe spam will not be a problem). Imagine how amazing Facebook could be if even just the interface was open-source, and available for any developer to work on. In addition, the alternative to making money from the users directly is to make that money in some other way, and this would require some centralized controlling force to execute. A fee-per-action system is the only totally neutral way to ensure both that each user is not being taken advantage of, and that each user isn't taking advantage of the server.

Honestly, I use a bunch of pretty subjective stuff to build my own opinions about the short-term future of Bitcoin.
Most of what affects my outlook is paying close attention to the news as traditional media sees it, the news as Bitcoiners see it, and then just the general mood, culture, and beliefs of the Bitcoin community itself. Beyond that it's stuff I couldn't really generalize.
As an example, I am very sure that we are nowhere near a crash. This is based on two major things, and probably also affected by smaller bits of news. First, the community quite simply *feels different* now than it did before the April crash. Back then, it was easy to see a lot of what you could call a frenzy. Anything optimistic in this sub was upvoted, and any bearish comments were downvoted. The other main piece of evidence is just that we're seeing micro-corrections regularly here, especially after sharp rises.

rideelement247 gives an example of something important to remember:
For every method of storing your paper dollars, you can use that exact same method to store a piece of paper with a private key to an address with bitcoins waiting, which is otherwise untouchable. Therefore, if you (or someone you trust) can make that piece of paper securely, then it is *at worst* as secure as any denomination of a dollar bill.

The thing is, right now, it doesn't matter if you're right, because the way you talk gives people the feeling that you almost definitely aren't. To me, at least, the feeling is so strong that it's difficult to seriously consider *anything* you have to say. And regardless of how right you *feel* and how obvious things *seem* to you, if you don't practice the skill of truly having a conversation with someone, no one will listen to you.
You jump too far from one point to the next. I feel like you'll interpret that as a compliment, but it's not--what might feel like leaps of intuition to you come across as seeing patterns that simply aren't there, to other people. Have you ever talked to a crazy homeless guy who thinks he's running from government hitmen? You sound a little like that:


This is a good example of what I mean. Clearly there is thought here, but the thoughts and order are inaccessible to anyone but you. I have no idea how "Life is real" ties into anything else you're saying, and i strongly doubt anyone else does either. The rest of the sentence is confusing because it doesn't seem to make any other point than that Facebook is a communication medium dealing with real information, which we all already know anyway. It sounds like you are hurrying to get your point across, skimming across your thoughts in a way that might feel poetic or enlightening at the time, but without actually going back and re-reading to see if they are actually easy to follow, *given that someone will think somewhat differently than you do*.
Take it or leave it, but my advice is that you stop playing the game "make the idiot realize he's an idiot" and start playing the game "learn something significant from this alien mind".

On the other hand, if I were to see a clearly *playful* ad talking about "magic internet money", I'd be a little intrigued. I'm on reddit anyway, looking for something amusing, so why not click on this silly little wizard? If I've heard of Bitcoin, all the better--now I'm already smiling a bit *and* I am looking forward to some sort of explanation that's not necessarily dry and boring.

I talked to someone with some server administration experience, and he estimated that the base AWS--a very basic package that is either free or $20/month--can handle 1000-3000 queries per second, given an "average" query (inasmuch as something can be defined). Taking the lower bound of 1000, I got the number of queries that would mean in a month (1000\*60\*60\*24\*30 = 2592000000), and divided that by three, since a tip takes three (very basic) SQL commands (864000000). Dividing that number by 20 gives a pretty solid lower-bound estimate for the amount of the number of queries $1 should pay for. Even if this is off by one or two orders of magnitude, it's still a ridiculously large amount of tips for $1.
Intuitively this doesn't seem *too* absurd--the incredible amount of companies that can offer content for free and make money on ads implies that the actual cost of serving the information is quite low.
EDIT: large amount of tips, not tiny.

I think you're jumping the gun a *little*, here. Almost everyone here agrees that one of bitcoin's most essential features is the fact that it's decentralized, and not controlled by any one entity.
However, if we have a trusted *agent*--no matter how big this agent is--who operates *within* the bitcoin protocol, I think this would add a lot of stability. The agent would be nothing more than a tool that people can choose to use--or not. It wouldn't have any kinds of power that, say, a trustworthy dude has in a neighborhood of people who trust him.
The fact is that there *does* need to be some formal organization. Not in the form of changing the Bitcoin protocol or culture, but in the form of getting a reliable, dependable business up and running that the bitcoin community can eventually trust--a business that can somehow *prove* its honesty and trustworthiness.

Well, first of all, remember that each deal is made on an individual basis and only according to the interests of the parties involved. So we can create whatever kind of trade we want. Usually this means that we'll agree on some *dollar value's worth* in bitcoin, and when the work is finished, that's what is used. So the price volatility doesn't actually matter at all.
What's nice is that lately, since the price hasn't been as volatile, I've been able to do at least short-term deals completely in terms of bitcoins.
So if the price is volatile, it doesn't matter to me. And if it's not, I can legitimately make deals in terms of bitcoins without mentioning dollars at all. I think as time goes on we'll just see a switch toward the latter behavior.

This service is not just a money-handling service. The power comes with the combination of the three commands--data, tip, and query--to quickly, cheaply, and easily build services and apps that can handle money.
For example, it takes a significant amount of time and expertise to build a simple Bitcoin gambling app the traditional way, and this would require you to pay for and administrate a server. Lots of people don't have this combination of time, money, and expertise. Within NetVend, however, a simple coinflip gambling service would likely be 100 lines or less (my rock-paper-scissors script was 135 lines), and take less than a day to write. The developer could either run this script manually regularly, or get a server that would only need to have cron job functionality.

If I was trying to gage Bitcoin interest within the patrons of a brick-and-mortar store, I'd put up a sign with a QR code that says "We're thinking of accepting Bitcoin! Send a small tip or let us know if you'd support this."
I feel like almost every Bitcoin-holder would be excited enough to do one of those to actions on seeing the sign, and the business would be able to get a really good look at how many people care.

While your points aren't ridiculous, I have the feeling that you're more interested in *attacking* the idea than actually *discussing* it. I'm willing to explain myself to someone who seems to be truly considering what I have to say. However, you seem to be *primarily* interested in telling me I'm wrong, and only *secondarily* interested in actually understanding what I'm trying to tell you.
With that in mind, this will be my last response. I'm going to try to explain this in general terms, rather than specific ones.
There are two somewhat separate systems here.
The first system is the server, which quite simply takes commands from anyone with money, and maintains a record of these commands, the data uploaded, and the tips transacted, for anyone to see. This server **must** remain neutral, and so it must allow any traffic that can pay its way in.
The second system is the set of all clients that people develop to use this server in a social way. It's these clients that will have to solve the problem of filtering out spam. This problem--entering a "dirty" set of data and extracting only useful content--is not unsolvable. I've given you examples of what I believe to be a pretty good beginning to a solution to this problem, but I'm not claiming that I have all the answers. What I am claiming is that the answers are out there, especially when every developer has access to something like a tip-history. This is different from karma, because there will always be ways to create karma out of thin air; this isn't the case with bitcoins. Therefore, a spammer only has as much "voting power" as he has bitcoins; and to vote with these bitcoins, he has to give them to someone else.
You seem to be claiming the opposite--that given a dirty set of data, no client could ever filter out all spam (or enough spam to be usable). This doesn't seem like a reasonable claim to me. If nothing else, clients will simply get *more restrictive* until a client can view the network without any spam. At this point, tools that help legitimate users break into the "clean" section of the network will naturally be developed, as there will be a need for them. The clients can utilize any kind of filtering systems they want, *including any of those used by the most successful social media providers of today*.
Given that any client can use a system similar to those already being used by the big players today, and also given that these clients will have access to a very unfakeable tip history, I believe this network will be better suited to sorting out spam--and that one day it will be nearly *perfect* at it.

Certainly, AWS isn't the perfect solution. The server I'm setting up is going to be a first-implementation of a pretty big idea, and AWS seems to be a good choice considering that. The fees will probably be a lot smaller when the project moves to a bigger server with more traffic.

The thing is, the processing cost necessary to actually successfully perform a double-spend makes it simply not worth it to try to double-spend for any small purchases.

**No one owes you microtransactions.**
Remember that every single part of this network is run by people whose best interests *lie* in running it. Miners don't have to accept your transactions; peers don't have to relay your transactions. Each of these entities does so because *it benefits them*, and that's where a lot of the beauty of this system comes from.
If someone can find a way to make a profit off of propagating microtransactions or including them in a newly mined block, then they'll do it; if even one mining pool does it, then you can connect directly to them and they, at least, will include your transaction. Changing the code of the **standard** client is not as big of a deal as it may seem--there are a lot of nonstandard clients (and miners!) out there. Furthermore, it's just as easy to mod the standard client as it was for Gavin to make the change in the first place.
And if no one can find a way to make money off of your microtransactions, tough shit. Welcome to the free market. The fact that you might not be able to send 0.000001BTC to a betting website is not the network's fault, any more than you hitting one red light was the fault of traffic engineers. I read somewhere an interesting idea: that people only complain about bad traffic when it inconveniences us *because* we're so used to it running smoothly. And no matter how much we complain about traffic, we still get in our car and drive to work everyday, because **it's simply orders of magnitude better than any alternative.**
I understand why a lot of people are upset: part of what a lot of people were sold on was the idea that a transaction could be infinitely divisible and virtually free. That was never entirely true, though; at least not in the long run. Anyone heavily involved in Bitcoin knows this. However, it's *so close* to being true that Bitcoin still has an amazing set of advantages over any other reliable payment system known to man. We're getting **a lot** out of this Bitcoin deal, regardless of whether we can send microtransactions.
Also, I'm sure that when bitcoins are more valuable, this limit (and transaction costs) will be lowered.

Well, to be honest, I don't know too much *about* their business idea. But I can at least tell you why I've never bothered to look into it.
Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, have a very elegant and complex system set up. Miners, blocks, and everything else about the system is designed so that not only does it *work*, but it works in a way that's decentralized, transparent, and open to anyone. As soon as you remove the decentralized nature of it--which Ripple has done--it's no longer neutral. The neutrality of Bitcoin is essential to those who really see it as world-changing. I know that if it wasn't for the decentralized (and therefore neutral) nature of Bitcoin, I'd be totally on the other side of the fence. Instead of investing, I'd be waiting for it all to crash.
By the way, I'm not talking so much about the fact that the *computer network* is decentralized; I'm talking about the fact that no one can "own" bitcoin in any way beyond owning coins.

That's a great question.
The system itself is centralized. This can't be avoided without drastically increasing fees--this is part of why a Bitcoin transaction costs so much, and why the fees of this system can be so incredibly low.
However, the server itself is very simple and easy to set up, and it's open-source. It will be trivial for anyone with server administrator experience to set up their own server, once the first implementation has been put up. So while the server I'm working on could be taken down, by the time that happens there will probably be quite a few similar ones out on the web, some of which could operate as a Tor hidden service--which, as far as I understand, are almost impossible to take down given the right precautions.
In the case of any kind of takedown, the users' funds should still be safe. In the technical writeup, you'll find a description of the security of the system. It consists of two servers--one public, and one hidden. Even if the public one was taken down, the hidden server is the one that actually holds the private keys to users' funds. If the hidden server (or the administrator thereof) notices that the public server has been taken down, it can return all funds to the users, based on the last record it was able to get about how much each user had before the takedown.
I'll also note that clients could be configured to connect to more than one of these servers for posting and browsing, which would allow users to effectively simultaneously use multiple servers. In this scenario, even if Big Brother or some other entity took down all but one server, many users may not even directly notice any difference in the operation of their clients.
I hope that made sense. If not I'm willing to try again =) Thanks for the question!

We won't have Bitcoin "banks". What we'll have is several *services* and *tools*.
Banks are incentivized to offer an array of services, to a *sufficient* degree of quality, to their account holders. This is because no matter how well some bank does one service (say in-bank transfers), no one will use the bank if it lacks even one of many other services which are considered necessary (debit/credit cards, a good online interface, customer support, etc.). It's just too inconvenient to use several banks, regardless of how well those banks specialize in any one thing--unless you're moving a ton of money around.
The difference with Bitcoin is that transaction costs are vastly, ridiculously lowered--and this will become even more true as tools are improved. It doesn't matter whether two services are offered by the same system/organization, because it's very *cheap* to use more than one Bitcoin service or tool in concert. If some Bitcoin service does one thing better than everyone else, I lose nothing by using that service instead of something offered by a system that I "already use".

If a bitcoin transfer system was implemented on facebook, we'd only be giving them a few pieces of information:
First, the transactions that take place. But these are public and easy to find anyway, so who cares?
Second, Facebook will have access to information about how some names are attached to some addresses. But it's a simple matter for anyone to mix the funds and put it in a different account, and that would be impossible for Facebook to follow.

I would say that the seed feature of Electrum is a *really, really nice feature* to have, if only for my peace of mind. I can keep a series of words (easy to write down and reenter without error) anywhere in the real world, and know that as long as I have that, I won't lose my bitcoins. To me, this is enough to make me choose Electrum over anything else that doesn't have a similar feature.
I would also say that, in general, increased security at the cost of increased complexity is always worth it, if it's the kind of complexity you can get used to after a learning curve.

If you're saying this is exactly as vulnerable as any other network, then I'm not sure what the problem is.
The big issue here is that we're attempting to create a truly *neutral* social network, immune to control by some centralized party. This means we must allow things that might be spam or other nefarious content (I'm going to refer to both of these as "spam" to keep it simple) to be posted--to try to ban it would require that someone have more power than the users. We can't at once have a neutral network and have a spam-free network.
However, what we *can* do is create clients that filter out the spam so effectively that it doesn't really matter how much spam is actually stored in the server. The fact that a client can iterate through the tip-history will be a very effective tool for this purpose.


I don't think you understand what I mean when I say "completely ignored". I mean that if I'm sitting around on the network, my client queries the server periodically, and is going to show me an *exclusive* set of information--information that matches some criteria. For each client, this criteria could be different, and the user will probably be able to change these settings. But consider how easy it is to filter out almost all fake accounts in a totally automated way:
To notify the user of a friend request, the request must meet one of these qualifiers:
- The requester is within their social network, through some-degrees-of-separation
- The requester has received some threshold of (or any?) tips from the user's already-trusted network of identities
- The requester has included a tip, and asks for it to be returned upon approval
The last point is an odd one, I know. It's a last-resort for that small percentage of legitimate users who can't meet the first two qualifiers. But if you're really asking to friend an old friend, you can probably trust him to return the money. On the other hand, a spammer simply can't afford to send these tips to every potential mark.
Another thing is that this list of qualifiers is just something I came up with off the top of my head. I think that when a developer can harness something as unfakeable as tip-trails, he could come up with some more excellent qualifiers that make it very difficult for spam to get through, but easy for legitimate users to.

Note that I'm not saying Bitcoin experience always trumps the knowledge that an economics expert has. I'm only saying that Bitcoin experience is more relevant than might be obvious to outsiders, and this can *sometimes* be enough to give the "experts" a little less weight than you would normally.
Also, I would argue that a true understanding of the technology is actually very important. For me, at least, it's most of the reason I'm so bullish on Bitcoin. It's the technology that gives Bitcoin it's strengths--therefore, understanding of the technology is actually pretty important in making an informed decision about it.

You do bring up one valid concern, and that's the whole issue of a trojan jumping from one client to another through the network. However, I don't think this will be an issue. Here's why:
Considering that the server is effectively a blank space that sells its space cheaply to anyone with money, the clients will be designed to view any data as just data, and not to allow this data to execute anything that changes the user's settings or files. We have the chance to effectively design these social network browsers from the ground up, and we'll be doing this with the knowledge that any data they pick up could be *literally anything*. I think this will allow us to make them pretty immune to injection-style attacks coming from the network itself.
If you're worried about things like phishing for private keys or keyloggers, you're worried about vulnerabilities with *any* crypto-intensive tool used by someone who also uses any kind of social network. Your point could be made just as accurately about Bitcoin, and it's certainly a concern--but not a fatal one.
You seem to be making the point that this network would be *particularly* vulnerable to trojans and other nefarious uses, but I'm not sure why you think this. It doesn't matter whether a spammer is allowed to make a billion accounts, because without actually participating in the network in some real way, each account will be completely ignored. There are a lot of websites with trojans on the web, but that doesn't mean the web is broken, because I (and most internet users) have gained the habits necessary to avoid them, and the tools we use have become pretty good at noticing them as well.


Again, you're making a criticism toward social networking in general, and I'm not sure why you think this network would be particularly vulnerable to this stuff. The amount of "fake" profiles a spammer is able to make simply doesn't matter, because for *each* profile, they will have to put in a lot of effort to get the profile exposed to any users in the first place.
It's like if I told you I had a bunch of hot girlfriends in Canada. It doesn't matter how many I claim to have, because to convince you of each, I'd have to provide evidence for each of them one by one. If I don't convince you of their reality, you'll ignore everything I have to say about them. In the same way, for each fake account a scammer made, they'd have to individually either tip someone enough to get noticed, or somehow convince a legitimate user through other channels to follow the fake account. Otherwise, they will *never be heard from*.

Technically, yes. Realistically though, it would be easy for the community to decide which new server should be the primary one. Bitcoin nodes choose a longer blockchain over a shorter one to solve this problem, and the community itself would effectively use a similar mechanism for a cloneable social network. The only difference is, they'd use the metric of "which one has more of my friends?". This is assuming one server doesn't have some obvious advantage over the other--like being administered by a more trusted identity, or having lower fees, etc.

But tipping to someone who already believes in Bitcoin... we have 0 chance of increasing Bitcoin adoption by one person.
Admittedly, there is a third case: someone who isn't yet a believer, but is open to the idea. This is a better investment, in terms of increasing Bitcoin adoption. But it doesn't mean that donating to this guy is pointless.

Personally, I'm not going to pay for a song until I can hear the entire thing first--even for just 0.001 btc. It's just too easy to get music for free (or "almost free", like with Spotify) these days. I think that if you're trying to make bitcoin off of *art*, it is more likely to get you significant returns if you first offer the content for free, then allow the user to easily pay after that.
I know, I could just pay a negligible amount, listen to the song, then pay again whatever I think is reasonable. But it's a hassle. Sure, less hassle than writing this all out was, but then, I'm writing this less to get the song for free for myself, and more to hope to convince you to reconsider your method of presentation.
If you have specific reasons for not doing this, I'd love to hear them! These are just my thoughts =)

Well, if you go try to mine by yourself, you have a small chance of mining the block successfully. If you're lucky enough to do this, you get the entire "block" of coins. What most people do, though, is join a mining *pool*, which distributes the coins more evenly, according to the processing time you've put in.


Over time, the number of coins people will be able to mine from a new block will diminish to 0, which is when we will have the maximum number of bitcoins available. I believe that it was recently 50 coins, and is now 25. (At that point, miners will be mining for transaction fees)

I'm not very clear on how M-Pesa works, but I'm curious about comparisons between that and Bitcoin--especially considering that [Bitcoin can now be handled via pure SMS](
Ask them this, and then of course clarify anything that's unclear to them: If Bitcoin were as widely-adopted locally as M-Pesa, would Bitcoin through this SMS service be more attractive? Are there hidden drawbacks to Kenyans switching to Bitcoin that us Westerners might not realize?

I would suggest not focusing too much on mining. Mining is cool and interesting to *some* people, but in my opinion it usually leads peoples' curiosity in the wrong direction--rather than focus on how Bitcoin can be used and what it means in a larger sense, they begin focusing on how it works, which is a very long rabbit-hole.

I'm working on a project that I believe fits your description: NetVend. It's like a public library, open to all readers and authors, which also supports tipping.
There is only one difference, and it will seem like a big one, but please hear me out before you make a judgement on this: it's not decentralized.
Decentralized services have the advantage of being extremely resilient to direct attacks, and are also fundamentally neutral in a way that centralized systems are not.
My system, while centralized, achieves these goals in different ways. It may not appear as "elegant" as a decentralized system, but I believe it achieves these goals just as well, in reality.
First, the code is open-source, and the database is transparent and can be verified independently in the same way the blockchain can. This means that if the NetVend server is taken down, anyone with a backup can recreate it with a copy of the database. The key here is that the database effectively confirms itself as legitimate, using hashes and signatures, and any tampering done by anyone--whether this is the current administrator or some third party--will become immediately, mathematically obvious. Currently, the project doesn't operate as a hidden service, but it could be made into a hidden service easily enough (it's just not a priority right now). So, while the server could be attacked, it can rise again immediately, with very little effort on a competent admin's part, and possibly behind the security of a Tor hidden service. At the time the server is reincarnated, all users and developers can verify for themselves that the database is exactly as it was, with no missing or modified records, without actually having to have a copy of the database themselves.
I've already talked a bit about this in the previous paragraph, but I'll focus on it more here, at the risk of repeating myself: The data stored in the server itself is proof of its own legitimacy. I would be happy to discuss the details, and I've written about them before (see the links below), but here is the gist of it: each command is signed by the user who authorized the command under that user's Bitcoin address, which means that any other user can verify for themselves that any one command on the server's transparent database did indeed come from where it claims to have come from. All action on the database points back to the original command that caused it, and in this way the entire server is verifiable as neutral and objective.
NetVend supports tipping and data storage. By encrypting the data client-side before storage, and by creating mixing services that operate on top of NetVend, it can facilitate both of your initial goals--excepting the p2p parts.
In addition, it is possible for a social client to be built on top of NetVend--this is actually the primary goal for us at the moment. This means that, not only would NetVend facilitate both open and private business among any two individuals, it would also support both open and private social network activity, while offering untraceable pseudonymous identities to users. This is important, because it brings true anonymity to the casual user, and broadcasts that anonymous voice to other casual users; at the moment, these capabilities are restricted to those with a deep understanding of cryptographic tools.
We have a working version of NetVend at the moment, which supports all of the self-verifying characteristics I've talked about above. We are at work now getting the message out, as well as building up the services that augment its operation, such as a social client. It's also worth mentioning that we have a working Python library that simplifies interfacing with the server to 3 lines of code, in order to execute any one of the three commands (store data, tip, and query)
I know some of this may seem wildly idealistic, or even naive. I beg you to bring up any concerns you have, and I promise I will be able to answer them satisfactorily. I believe this NetVend is the beginning of a very big idea, and I'm willing to spend a lot of time explaining that opinion to anyone who is intrigued enough to think they see some fatal flaws in this system.
[here]( is a recent post that focuses on recent developments on the NetVend server itself.
[here]( is a somewhat older article that focuses on the social network application of the NetVend server.
I hope to hear from you, as well as any other readers who are interested in this project.

Hand out the passphrase to access a brain wallet that will have some not-inconsequential amount of Bitcoins waiting for them.
There could be a tool that will provide an address for donations, then generate a pdf giving the basic information about how much has been donated to the brain wallet (in terms of bitcoins and also however much it's worth in local currency at time of printing), how to access it, and where to go for more information about how to set up their own wallet and transfer the funds there.
It would be nice if a user could donate once to one account, then split those funds into multiple brain wallets, and print out a whole bunch of these bitcoin coupons. Maybe they could be put in a sealed envelope with only the amount on the outside, with a note about how it was sealed on the inside; this would help prevent people from picking up a "used" coupon and having their first interaction with bitcoin be rather disappointing.

I think there are enough innate perks to the system (instant, easy tips; facilitated identity management; intrinsic neutrality, total verifiability and transparency, etc.) to begin to draw users in even with very basic interfaces. Coupled with the fact that any developer can tweak or recreate interface if they choose, I believe the idea has more than enough to overcome the critical mass / network effect problems. I already have stuff I'd like to say anonymously on this network, but would never put on Facebook, which is clearly watched closely by the NSA and difficult (to say the least) to truly retain anonymity on. There are many things this network could do that Facebook simply could not, and this alone would be enough for some users.
Implementing crypto is actually very easy--it's just a matter of finding the right libraries. After that it's a single function call, in most cases. I know for a fact that, if you have access to the reference bitcoin daemon, both message signing and encryption/decryption are all operated with single function calls. Brainwallet.org's interface is also open-source and well-documented, from what I saw, and that performs all of these cryptographic operations.

Two things come to mind:
There is no drug test for Bitcoin, which means that there's no way a company can refuse to hire me just because I've used Bitcoin in the last month. In my opinion, this is a HUGE tool they have against marijuana, which they won't have against Bitcoins.
There is a significant portion of humanity that has a negative connotation associated with marijuana, which makes it much easier for the gov. to get away with criminalizing it. I don't think it would be the same with Bitcoin.

I believe that easy-to-user mixing services is one of the many improvements we'll see. If you use a mixing service between your secret and non-secret addresses, I think that would take care of this problem.

All keypairs (addresses) are actually created randomly. What's important is the **magnitude** of the amount of variety in possible keypairs/addresses:
If the entire sun's energy output was harnessed for the rest of its life only to generate random addresses, you *still* wouldn't be likely to find any one given address, because there are *so many*. This is based on thermodynamic limits of the universe.

I think it's important to keep in mind that  we're having a *temporary* influx of new bitcoiners. Someday soon it won't be much different than it was before this influx, as these new users get more familiar with Bitcoin. I'd rather have the noobs stick close to the "experts", anyway.

I wouldn't call it zero-knowledge, but rather transparent-knowledge. In other words, the only thing the server knows is the same stuff we do: unencrypted (and therefore public) stuff.

Yeah, that *would* be weird and unnatural. You don't *have* to tip someone to keep up with them; you can just follow them. If you follow each other, then you can interact normally like you would on Facebook, without ever tipping each other for anything.
It's when person A doesn't follow person B, but person B would like to talk to person A, that the tip-history filters would come in. In the same way that Facebook requires you to "friend" each other before anything can really happen beyond messages, this network would simply require that you follow each other. But any of this is up to whichever developer is making the interface, and I think we'll see tools that offer this as a setting, not a permanent characteristic.


This would be true, except that unless a victim purposely follows one of the bullies, there's no way the bullies can contact the victim directly. Unless they'd like to send him a tip, that is, which seems unlikely.

This has certainly been thought of, but I don't know of any service where tipping is *easy for the casual user*. The bitcointip bot is one of the better ones, in my opinion--and it's still just a command-based interface. This might seem natural to people who are used to using that kind of technology, but it's absolutely not for anyone alien to it.
In addition, most tipping services I've seen still have a minimum tip amount or transaction cost in the ballpark of a few cents.




The information on the database is, for each entry, either transparent or encrypted by and for users. There's no information to be "bribed" away, because the only unencrypted information is left that way on purpose, with an attitude similar to twitter posts. Imagine Facebook with two post buttons: Post Publicly, and Post Encrypted.
Each of the commands takes a very tiny fee, on the order of less than a cent. I wouldn't call it a bribe, since it's the same price for each user, and all users get the same level of access, regardless of their finances. A user could download the entire database with one query, and would only pay the (again, **tiny**) cost to get the data.




I wanted to keep the post brief, but the technical writeup goes into this. I'll try to summarize some of it here.
Basically, any information you post is available for anyone to see. Clients will be built that have client-side encryption. Like I said earlier, there might be two buttons: Post Public, and Post Encrypted (optionally to a specific user).


For each user, the server stores their *public* key. For a user to execute any command, the command must be sent *as well as* the text of the command signed with the corresponding private key. In this way, the user proves their identity with each command--to the server, and to anyone else who cares to view the record of their command.
This actually prevents the whole server from being subversively affected, since any non-user-approved meddling would become obvious on a mathematical level.


Not sure yet. I have some ideas, but interfaces aren't my thing. When the server is working, anyone is free to create any interface they want--the server doesn't care where the commands come from as long as they're signed. I'll certainly try to make a cool interface, but I think it's more important to note that regardless of how good mine is, anyone else can make another one, with or without my cooperation.


No. Any user can immediately verify the legitimacy of any action by checking the signature of any command. If the server says that I tipped your friend so much value, you can check the signature of that command and verify that only someone with my private keys could have signed it.


From what I understand, diaspora was aiming to be a decentralized network. So it's at least different in that way. I also don't think Diaspora facilitates tipping, and it certainly doesn't focus on it.

I was in the same boat as you. I tried bitinstant and was pretty satisfied. You can print off a moneygram payment slip, pay it at a CVS or wal mart (as well as some other places I didn't pay attention to), and they'll send bitcoins to either a simple bitcoin address or (for example) a mtgox account. I chose to do a wal mart moneygram and send it to a bitcoin address, and the bitcoins was already confirmed in my wallet when I got home. There are more fees this way, but it was worth it for me.

Depending on what you mean by "we", your statement could easily be true. However, I'm talking about the subreddit's users in general, without any kind of clarifier about who a "real" Bitcoin user is. If the users care about the price, that's what we'll see on the front page; if not, then we won't. From this, I think it's reasonable to deduce that the *users of the subreddit* cared more about the price then than they do now. How else do you explain the difference in popular topics?

Mike mentioned that we don't have a tradenet yet. I argue that we do have one--or at least, the seed of one.
[NetVend]( is a server that facilitates communication and payment between any two identities, and can be operated easily by a program or by a human. There is some progress to still be done, but the server is pretty much finished. All the rest of the work that needs to be done is on the open-source interfaces and services that will make the system better as a whole, and these can be developed independently by anyone.
