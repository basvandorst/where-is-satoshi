So you are going to trust this bag of spanners with the creation of  a crypto currency when they cant even manage there fiat currency.  If they are in charge of issuing this crypto they will inflate the hell out of it.   Their fiat currency was backed by the biggest proven oil reserves in the world and it still tanked. Good luck with that one.

I think you will find that none of the leading economists invested in bitcoin at the best time, which was 5 years or more ago

Segwit , Liquid, Lightning network and Bakkt should all work to get her to increase network capacity and decrease cost.  The bitcoin network did not buckle it became congested and you had to pay more for your ticket to ride. Or you could pay less and wait for the network to be less congested. More capacity equals less congestion and lower fees.  I suspect Bakkt will provide the most benift as it totally off chain second layer solution that will allow the big financial institutions to trade high volume of bitcoin off chain while still holding the actual real bitcoin in cold storage.  To sum up the network has more capacity this time. And Bakkt will allow stock exchange leveles of bitcoin based transaction without affecting bitcoin transaction costs.

Jesus Christ you guys are Cray Cray with the the fud. If you don't like tether don't use it there are plenty of alternatives now. If you do like tether use it, it's never been proved to be unbacked. But can we please stop banging on about it all the time nothing has changed apart from the fact there around six other stable coins you can use instead of tether now.
