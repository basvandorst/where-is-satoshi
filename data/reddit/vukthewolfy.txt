As for blockchain, I can see only Btc and Ether there. So, "Bitcoin Cash is supported by blockchain.info", if you, hypothetically speaking, send me B cash, I will receive it, but I won't see it? What is the option then, that I can do to get my B cash? Thanks again.

I most certainly will, but need a year or two to finish my education. Hope the crypto saga wont end till I lay my hands on some money.

One of top Ph.D. students in my class with timely projects that can only cover my bare needs. In a failed country where no one gives a fuck about science...Trying to get myself from the bottom though...
