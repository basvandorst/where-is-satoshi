Taxes.  But I think school will be replaced by VR goggles (Oculus Rift) ala "Ready Player One" (book) in a decade or two (out of necessity of increasing costs), so what the fuck do I know?  
The energy cost of shipping students, faculty, and staff in (shared) metal boxes powered by tiny explosions set on 4+ inflated rubber tori to a shared space that is inefficiently heated might be thought of as being pretty outdated by then.  But it all depends on how fast we can get away from petroleum in the coming fifty years.

That's definitely an interesting take, especially since receipts are known to cause cancer and contain an irregularly large amount of biphosphenol-A (I believe that's the one, anyways) in them.  I felt that it was especially interesting to learn that wet hands, which are common in restaurants when handling receipts, make the transfer of BPA into our bodies about 10x more effective.  Fun!
So Bitcoin prevents cancer.  Sorta.  haha.

Reality often necessitates forceful changes regardless of what we want (example: war).  These are forces sometimes more beyond our control than we grasp.
Assumption: you don't want to pay for public school because you've grown up in a self-absorbed society and had this belief granted/passed to you through a variety of means (the opinion may be valid or not, but for the sake of discussion it honestly doesn't matter).  
Hypothetical situation that is happening all across the USA right now so it's not actually that hypothetical: how about you vote to stop paying so much for public schools since they suck so much?  Then the stupid, poor kids (let's be honest, the two are sometimes the same, society loves to pretend it isn't true but we have some serious class issues) with parents earning less than six figures can get a better, cheaper, more sustainable and infinitely more scale-able education in VR because of your decision to vote against public schooling.
I'm arguing that the natural increasing pace of resource use combined with the strongest anti-tax currency we've ever seen might make this almost inevitable.  You can hope all you want, but your own opinions seem awash with foreshadowing.
I work in government and I am watching financial blunders most humans aren't capable of comprehending (which is probably why the blunders are made in the first place).  Our leaders are children playing on a playground in adult clothing.  Each successive president is more and more like a movie star because it's less about substance and more about style.  Reality is already being drained, with most of us spending the vast majority of our time in entertainment of our choosing.  Then we die and realize in the last few moments of life that much of our time was completely wasted here because we just did what we were told, alone in front of the latest amazing mass-produced HDTV, laughing by/to/with/for ourselves, in the saddest caricature of the American dream that has yet formed (though it's ever-changing).
How is a VR learning environment actually worse?  It's not like you can't turn it off when you want to be done.  I would say a VR learning environment would empower individuals that are presently held back by the "pull up the bottom students" approach of public schooling (I felt I was on the other side and would have excelled beyond my own dreams with a tutor, so your public school argument isn't without at least some evidence).

I actually try to talk to younger people about BTC more often than old people, because their reception to what I'm talking about is often far more appropriate (I have been accused of some pretty remarkably outlandish stuff when talking to adults about it).
Interestingly, dogecoin is less of a joke among young people, too.  I think sometimes this community forgets how important a community is to "true adoption" among peers because we were the first.  In my opinion, this is hubris that tarnishes our currency of choice, but I'm not about to argue about first-mover advantage or predicting the future.

Could you explain your reasoning behind the environment being better taken care of without regulation when regulation, in some cases, forces awareness of environmental factors into the big picture for a corporation?  Could you explain why China has less regulation (or US businesses wouldn't have fled there), and more pollution (they are working on this as we speak, of course) from the same US companies when the line is traced from production to consumption?
I am trying very hard not to pedantic or facetious with this post, and I want to ensure it doesn't come off that way (I often have this problem, please bear with me).  I am genuinely curious what your response would be since we all must use the same water supplies, ecosystems, and environment, and it has always been obvious to me that not all of us value it the same way.  Namely, some humans basically "shit where we eat" and have absolutely no problem with it, to put it plainly.  I see this as an insurmountable problem when in a "truly" free market and China is currently an excellent example of this behavior if we actually look and listen carefully:  
To assume this is the only type of problem present in a deregulated environment would be folly in my book.  I'm not saying I have the answer to this complicated problem, as I do otherwise enjoy the benefits of a (halfway) free market myself.

Good for you.  I'm in IT and post on all the time (and often facepalm about the crap being posted these days).  In case you're in need of a quick rundown:
- The Intel's have the highest reliability rating (and are plenty fast, though not the *fastest*), but are prohibitively expensive.  
- OCZ has had a really ruinous past filled with bad drives, but supposedly their latest offering is better(?).  I'm not so sure, and it seems like the reviews speak for themselves, with the new products being only slightly more reliable (and generally still awful for anyone who wants it to work for longer than a year).  That said, the Vertex 3 is insanely fast.
- I use a Crucial M4, which, to me, strikes an awesome balance between price, performance, and reliability.  They aren't perfect in any category, but they are good-to-great in all three.  If you browse Newegg, you can see that others tend to agree with me on this.

According to what I understand about economics, even **expected** changes in demand can change the exchange rate of a particular store of value.
The reason gold and silver are so expensive right now, still, is because there is still higher *risk* of US debt insolvency (or hyperinflation, but not both) than there was before they were worth this much (pre-2008, basically).  I'd argue that the same factors may also be the reason bitcoin is on the rise, as well.

Bitcoins aren't made by anyone. They are "mined" (like gold in the real world, or marble in Minecraft).
Cool, but marble doesn't exist in Minecraft(outside of mods that I and most others have not played).  Iron, Gold, Diamond, Redstone, Lapis Lazuli, or Coal seem like fitting alternatives.

Because I was pinned down by dwolla's AML (anti-money laundering) practices (sigh) to get verification, as well as the 30-day account creation delay, as well as a 5-day delay in the actual transfer to Intersango, etc, I missed sinking any income into bitcoin earlier in the year when it was $5.00.  By the time I purchased it had already passed $10.00.
I sincerely regret that now.  That's all I have to say on this subject - basically, there is no correct time to buy, but I definitely have a heck of a lot more faith in bitcoin than the dollar, which makes me think that if I'm anything like everyone else in the world, it should go up A LOT more, but continue to fluctuate wildly like gold or silver prices.
Ultimately, you are asking for advice regarding a topic that nobody can do anything but speculate on.  This is quite similar to asking the same exact question about a stock.  You should, however, flip that analogy on its ass: Bitcoin is more reliant on the newly created anonymous electronic black market and general cryptocurrency adoption rates (I expect usability to go way up, so all my friends stop bitching about how hard it is to use bitcoins - that's when they'll really start to go up in value) than it is on anything within the "official" global economy.
Some more wild speculation (might be fun or depressing to think about depending on your attitude):
Around this time next year we will probably see the fed trying to end Bitcoin for good - or at least attempt to end US citizens being able to convert their value to another currency like this.  They will either ultimately fail (or fail to act, same consequences), which would eventually dissolve our current banking system into something unrecognizable after a period of systemic collapse (like Napster and later digital distribution did to CDs, but...not involving art, instead involving everything you put a dollar value on and exchange dollars for now, including gas, groceries, you know, all the stuff you live on), or succeed and turn the USA into the next fascist state (this has nothing to do with politics at all, it's more of an "old money" vs "new money" power struggle).  If the latter happens I have absolutely no freaking clue what will happen to the value of existing bitcoins or whether I'll even live through it.
Sorry, this might come off like insane person collapse nonsense and you may think that the government has blankets, warm milk and freshly baked cookies waiting for all of us in case of unforeseen consequences like this.  However, it is my opinion that the next few years are going to be insane and you may want to have bitcoins around in case your fiat money suddenly isn't worth anything, which is primarily why there have already been plenty of Greeks (and geeks, since we're the only ones that get real news these days) putting money into Bitcoin earlier this year.  It's an extraordinarily logical thing to do when it's too fucking late, so you may want to show up early to the party like we are in order to minimize losses post-collapse.
Even if you aren't a fucking nutjob like me, putting money into bitcoin seems like a very sound speculative "investment", if you can call it that.  I just think of it as a way to protect against inflation, like gold or silver, but easier to work with and it probably won't be stolen as easily (for a while).  Just keep a good head on your shoulders and keep your eyes on for news - Bitcoin may someday go down in flames due to some factors that nobody has yet considered, so it would be wise to remain informed.

I have a computer science degree from a *private* institution, you didn't pay a damn cent of my tuition (no FAFSA), I busted butt to obtain nearly 100% scholarships to pay for my schooling, and I own my own web business (mildly successful).  Also, I work for the government, and we're poor as fuck, which, I guess, is why they call us public servants!  I work my ass off 8-5, am on-call after-hours (through the weekend), and make peanuts compared to pretty much any other IT position in the country, but thanks for your understanding and care!

How old are you?  I meant that to be competitive in today's job market, a 4-year degree is *absolutely mandatory*.  This was shoved down my throat since 3rd grade.
Ok, so now let's do a cross-section of my friends - the ones that went to college and are now 20, 30, 40+ thousand dollars in debt have been able to, (about five years after college now) find a job that pays them, on average, $15/hr.  Congrats, guys.  That's going to earn enough money to pay debts off in...10 years.  Did our parents have to deal with this?  Absolutely not.  They were fucking and buying houses when they were our age.  A very small shred of 20-to-30-somethings are actually going along with that American Dream nonsense, and that's because they come from rich families.
How is it college voluntary if it's mandatory to be able to *get* a decent job in the first place?  Answer: it's not actually voluntary.  It's exactly what conservatives have wanted for years: non-public-funded education.  This is just one of the many expenses that is stripping away the middle class.
The ones that *chose*, as you imply, *not* to get a college degree are still living at home and don't have jobs, because none are available anymore that are even worth their time.  Entitlement again, yes, sure, but they wouldn't be able to earn a "living wage" regardless.  Minimum wage is not livable.  There are many problems which I think you're glazing over and not observing (whereas we are fighting every day to keep up - it's a very quiet war on the young), which is sadly, pretty standard fare for conservatives in America.  Hell, I'd say it's our number one problem - lack of real empathy (plenty of examples of fake empathy though, like "giving" money to a church, when really it's just like paying fare for something you've already been given).  Real empathy is you understanding my struggle, and perhaps even joining in it, or vice versa.
These posts are all over reddit.  I'm not alone in being both young and poor.  I'd love to put more of my nonexistent money into things like bitcoins, but obviously it's not going to happen.

Bitcoin is a deflationary currency vs the USD, Euro, and other fiat being inflationary.
If nothing else, it's a better store of value over time than your local currency for exactly this reason.  
With some possible exceptions happening as a result of specific events (successes or failures), a finite resource will *never* be as cheap in the future as it is now.
The same principle applies to gold, silver, platinum - even gasoline/petrol.  Unless we suddenly "find more", these stores of value are going to become more and more "expensive" in whatever your local currency might be.

This is very interesting, but why are bubbles truly to be avoided?  Does it destroy trust in a currency unit?
If nothing else, bitcoin might remain something of a novelty to nations that have presently-stable currency...until said currency disappears entirely (collapse).
More importantly, it only appears to be a bubble if you're basing your value comparison on *another unit of exchange*, right?  I mean, the same thing happens with currencies around the world, doesn't it?
I'm definitely in over my head here, just trying to figure things out with you guys.

It won't actually generate that much USD equivalent per month.  Right now, BTC is in a bubble phase.  It will pop back to reasonable levels someday in the future, but first everyone will be swept away in a "this is different" belief.  Also, you aren't the only person who is interested in obtaining one of these.
Difficulty will quickly increase to the point of *requiring* one of these to get ANY reasonable return IF a.) BL can keep up with demand, which they have shown repeatedly that they cannot do, *and* b.) BL is not exaggerating these claims of effectiveness.  They also have a tarnished record in this regard.

Just keep paying for bitcoins.  You're effectively removing yourself (bit by bit, no pun intended) from the dollar economy and adding yourself to the bitcoin economy, making the dollar weaker (shrinking the network of exchange) and the bitcoin stronger (growing the network of exchange).  This effect, of course, is insanely small, but the more of us there are, the bigger the dent will be.  If there's enough of us moving to bitcoin, the dollar will actually drop in value, something that is rarely (if ever) mentioned...anywhere.
Fiat is only useful so long as we decide it is, and the same is true with bitcoin.  We are living in such a crazy world these days...

Is this true, though?  I have never seen this social contract he speaks of, but it is interesting that this could have the potential to thwart bitcoin's growth during critical mass adoption stage (right now).  Otherwise, why wouldn't we just use PayPal, or like he says, VISA?


The blockchain is a system for transferring value, of which the final total is specified in advance. Those are the terms of the social contract every Bitcoin holder has adopted understanding. Those are the terms every node has agreed to voluntarily participate in the network.
Nodes and miners have not unanimously agreed to have their resources/time spent inefficently processing informational messages like "you lose", "you win", or even "I bet on &lt;this&gt; game with &lt;this&gt; much". This was never part of the agreement.

I recommend putting money in slowly over time to get rid of your emotions in bubbles like this.  $50 today, $50 next week, $50 the week after...no matter the value.  If it goes down to $20/BTC, then just buy $50 worth that week too (or more if you're feeling frisky).  This is how I'm doing it and it allows me to stop worrying about the price going back down again, because it simply won't matter.

Speculation is an assessment, not of value now, but of expected value in the future.  If, indeed, the price of bitcoin ends up being $1000 in a few years, it will only hit that price with as much turmoil and  fluctuation as we have today.  For a stock, that's fine.  For a currency, this sucks ass and will be a large barrier for the bitcoin economy to overcome.  It may become so rampant that it more-or-less stalls bitcoin entrepreneurship due to the level of speculation.  I doubt it, but this is possible.
Fluctuation of a currency has the potential to at least prevent it from becoming a mainstay.  You'll continue to think about goods in other valuations, such as dollars, rials, yen, pounds, etc, therefore it won't ever truly end up as a reliable/predictable store of value, and instead end up as a unit of holding "in a ponzi scheme" (as the detractors will say) that has no real economy to speak of, just a bunch of "stockholders" that do not care about using bitcoins, only holding them.
When all speculators like your(potential, I'm not blaming anyone here)self leave the market, we will have another month like August 2011.  Bitcoin may fall through the floor, and another cryptocurrency that has planned around these issues in advance may take its place.  Many of us just want a currency that is reliable and potentially anonymous but not fiat, given the inherent problems and risks associated with fiat.

There are highly specific reasons why that card is priced well above a normal Black Lotus, and it would be a waste of time to talk about it.
Also note that this link technically isn't an auction, it's a Buy It Now, which means this seller can sit on this stupid outrageous price as long as he wants, and nobody may ever buy it.  It's like having a BTC buy at $5 or a BTC sell at $900, it's just not happening (bad example, I know, but it's at least relative to this subreddit).
I don't own a single Black Lotus because I don't want to spend that much money on a single piece of stylized cardboard.  It'd be neat to have one, but I'm just not comfortable or secure enough in life to have something that is such a theft magnet.

Only Avalons, and afaik, they are sold out within minutes for each batch.

The cumulative effects on one group of citizens not paying for "burny insurance" (or whatever it is you are suggesting to be the alternative) would be tremendous, and impossible to understate, if a fire actually burned down their building and harmed some of them.

Slower (conservative) uptake on price adjustment, price based in local currency vs using bitcoin as the primary (for now - if BTC ever gains significant enough market share, as in &gt;50% [yes, I giggle madly about this because I don't think it will happen until I'm long gone] this will flip-flop).

I define "more than I would ever need" as ~6-$10 million equivalent.  We all define this figure differently.  I do not intend to "sell bitcoins" though so much as create an economy to spend them in, in the meantime.
I would run a small business (Magic card shop, IT repair shop) the way I want to run it - more like a charity than a business, haha.
I would also stay modest and own a house worth *well* under half a million dollars, probably around $200k (those being the "upper limit" of what I was looking at last year), and even consider starting a family now that I may even have the time to raise the kids properly.

If you're thinking about bitcoin valuation in terms of "gains", then, in my opinion you are just doing it wrong and deserve to lose some money anyways.  Besides that, it's not like bitcoin will never be at these levels again, even if it is a bubble.  The cryptography itself has proved resilient enough, and the network is stronger than ever (especially with reference to mining since a few very lucky people have ASICs in their hands).

Fortunately, so did the labor movement in America, as well as the black rights' movement, the women's rights' movement, etc.  Progress isn't pretty, and even in OWS recently there was a *huge* amount of piggybacking by other groups trying to hijack for their own agenda.  Fuck, it's basically all the media reported on, shamefully.  Now our president is trying to address the gap between the rich and poor in his presidential speeches, so obviously something (/hot air, depending on which color you subscribe to - I'm not really a colors guy) came as a result of OWS.

One thousand years in the future, your comment is resurrected in an internet archive:
We have here an insensitive sludge of the human race, long since forgotten, and even a step better, at this point - prevented.  This one thought it was funny to miscategorize sexual preference, as if it were derogatory or inflammatory (the joke here being the common denominator of animalistic instinct, very banal, ugly stuff).  It may be mentioned that this was a trend at the time among working class Amerikens that also happened to infect wealthier parts of society (of course, this was when wealth was still shored up in inefficient generational pockets, as opposed to being exchanged with the rapid precision of today's nanomarkets) to a lesser degree.  Most of the monkeys of the time weren't at all aware of this, of course, and years of pain in forming self-identity were often endured by the thoughtful from these thoughtless, tactless beings that were merely echoing cruelty that had been previously passed to them, unaware of the potential damage of the ripple effect.
But you, students, you of course benefit from the modernity that progress always brings.  Hate has all but been bred out of our gene pool by now, so this isn't something Wargy High School will ever have to deal with - or tolerate.

Most strangely of all, though, I find that even I come out of the woodwork and feel more willing to post here during a bubble, as I don't feel that my contributions are usually adequate enough for attention.  I'm not a business owner, or even a mathematical genius programmer guru or anything, I just work in IT for a county government and really, I'm a small fry that just loves the ideas and feels a bit sensationalist about the possibilities.  *shrug*

Plenty of good people do not understand probability.  Take the religious, for instance.


Having multiple competing fire departments isn't guaranteed to happen, because this type of business is highly territorial and not easy to replace.  Trash services are about the only example I can think of that comes close - and in some areas, management of waste isn't exactly competitive at all, even though it should be.
Lowest prices.  Think about that.  Do you really want the guy saving your life to be paid minimum wage?  There would be walmart-style fire-fighting companies that sacrifice quality for the almighty dollar, these are probably the only ones people like you and I could afford.  Of course, corporate protection would be available, just always out of reach for citizens.
It would be like health care.  Some might be able to afford it for a time, but the price of good care would skyrocket, and "good enough" care wouldn't be good enough - it would be a modeled reflection of what the rich can afford (one solution) combined with what the poor can afford (a different, far worse solution).  We soon won't even have a middle class if current trends continue, and if that happens, the "free market solution" would be a total nightmare.  We are then *totally* locked out of earning our way out of the fucked-up hole we have been pigeoned into.


I've run out of time, but yes, I do agree that it's possible to have fewer problems with less government - I am currently employed in a local government and see waste in every single direction - but I cannot change it because it's like trying to move a wall (and I'm not old, so I must be naive/stupid).  This is all extremely debatable, but it's not likely we'll ever have much impact on the system.

Not true.  Plenty of counterfeit silver exists, just go to a random local pawnshop and tell them you want to see some of their silver.  Though many bigger chain shops exercise strict testing requirements, many also do not, and the counterfeit coins/bullion (usually coins, tbh) slip through the cracks to lesser-known and shadier shops.
I do not speak about the origin of this silver, nor do I care very much, but rumors suggest a link to China, which is interesting because rich business owners there have also been buying up a lot of silver and gold recently.

Actually, I'm buying today, friend, and have absolutely no intention of selling, since I've been subbed here since the very beginning and want to build the bitcoin economy rather than cash back into the shitty dollar one (which I'm already too big a part of).

Sometimes people invest in gold when they think the world will still see progress, as a hedge against their other investments.
I work for the government, and I have money in bitcoin and silver because I see them as hedges against the mess of inefficiency I come across daily (and ultimately repeatedly fail at improving due to mismanagement/power struggles/politics/lack of knowledge at the top).  
In fact, I work here because it is sometimes very easy, it's not easy for my boss to fire me, the benefits are still good (though the employer is trying to scrap them) and I get (for now?) a reliable paycheck in USD to convert to whatever goods or services I need.  Bitcoin may be much more relevant to me if the US government was destroyed, but I don't have as deep of pockets as some people, so I won't stand to benefit quite as much, either.
Previous attempts at jobs I had worked at in the private sector forced me to analyze wtf I was doing wrong.  As a result, I ended up here.
You could, however, say I'm...*puts on Deus Ex shades*...an enemy from within.  Hopefully this reference is not lost here.
Sadly, however, it's not nearly that cool.  It's more like I can't see the future so I may as well distribute my income over a few different weird mediums of exchange.

I have the strangest feeling that your comparison won't be lost to many here.  
Regardless, well put.  My Jalapeno is doing well and earning ~0.19 BTC per night for now, but much less than that in a month (as usual).  It should pay itself off, at least, so I can't hold too much of a grudge.

Just not at the same time - so let's not encourage anyone else but you to do this stuff today.  The last thing we need is 1000 simultaneous emails landing in Gabe's insanely busy inbox.  The guy is incredible, but he's also human and will certainly be frustrated by such an approach.

To be fair, there are $750 Magic cards like Black Lotus or any of the other original P9.  I'm sure some were likely traded on mtgox back then, in addition to the many "Jace, The Mind Sculptor" or other $100 cards floating around.
Still, this always seems like a good point to bring up.

Vaporware meaning it's not functioning properly and is way behind schedule; I think you answered your own question, there, matey.  =)

And if so, it might even make more money than my poor, stupid jalapeno, which is hard at work failing right now.

Ah, good.  I got to Hell difficulty and started asking questions like "wtf am I still doing playing this game?  I'm not enjoying myself at all..."
Glad to hear things have been buffed up on the endgame.  As weird as it sounds, my favorite thing to do in Diablo II was just rock on with the cows all day, lol.
I'll give it another shot soon.

Jesus fucking Christ, get this link up on your phone, turn the computer off now(NOWNOWNOWNOW), download the latest Hiren's BootDVD 15.1 (torrent link easily found at bay of scallywags that includes the extra utils I'm about to mention) and run GetDataBack NTFS through "Mini Windows XP" (a small, portable optical- and USB-flash-bootable version of windows independent of your hard drive), assuming you were/are on Windows.  Make sure you have a USB drive or some other storage device to pull the wallet.dat (SEARCH FOR THIS) to.  It should be in appdata/roaming, that weird hidden application directory attached to your Windows profile.  YOU CAN DO IT!!!
You're talking about **$232,500** now (first figure of 5k coins, second figure of 3k is still **$139,200**), which is why I feel that this is all very important, as I'm sure you can agree.

What is that one called, LSD kitty?  Christ, haha

I find bitcoin to be an awfully useful penny stock, myself.

Indeed.  I've been watching this project since late 2010 or so (a friend tipped me off to it) and got in embarrassingly late given that perspective, but pretty early considering where we're at now.  Balls deep is something that is never a good idea, though.  You could still end up a millionaire from this yet, and none of us really want to be "the 1%" anyways, right?  In my opinion, that's way too much responsibility/pressure...not to mention stress.  Yuck.

This is by far the best product for bikes though:
Not an affiliate link, just a friendly neighborhood bitcoin biker.
First wipe the chain with a paper towel (turn pedal backwards, find that spot of the chain you can "grab"), then apply this lube drop by drop.  Then wipe it down with a paper towel again until the towel is coming back looking about 1/4 as black as in the beginning.  It doesn't take as much as you might think!
Good luck out there.

Cool.  Considering all of the downtime they used to have, this news is great to hear.  Moving back today myself, though I only do about 1 GH/sec (maximum), so I'm a very small fish in the sea.

A compelling story, but not one that has anything to do with me.  I bet you're right, though, there will probably be a lot of pissed off parents after today.
Call of Duty is just not a good game, there's nothing to talk about.  I much prefer Unreal Tournament 99/2004, myself.
The price just keeps going lower!  *nimbly presses fingers together quickly* when should we buy?
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:31:53
Is it a bubble, then, or does the "this time it's different" warning simply not apply to bitcoin *because it is actually completely different than everything before it?*  I'm as interested as you are at the possibilities, but the answers aren't here yet.  =)
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:02:38
Very strange, but I agree with you, it's like I'm part of a big fraternity that is intent on kicking corrupt banker ass (to extend this metaphor, the Persians are obviously corrupt bankers, and our bitcoin brotherhood may "die" in attempting to stand for this ideal).
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:57:19
I am laughing hysterically right now, thank you so much, really.  =)

This is probably the best investing advice in this thread.  Spreading out buys AND sells during moments of crazy activity like this is best, but don't listen to me: I just bought $4k worth @ $150 this morning like a fucking idiot, thinking it was the new floor price.  Good times!
@_date: 2013-03-07 16:31:38
Fascinating business idea.  I wish you luck.  I do play Minecraft too, maybe I'll hop on and check it out.  :)
