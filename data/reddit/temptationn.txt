got that same email 3 years ago (Coinbase just sent you 0.03798 BTC (worth $10.00 USD) using Coinbase.) 
go ahead and look at how much that $10 is worth now.. guess what? Sold it for $8 :)

shouldve bought in at 13500 yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:44:45
at this rate? chances are pretty slim. bitcoin was trending hard durning that week because of the rise in price EVERYONE was talking about it on my facebook, even my co workers. now I hear nothing from them. Again it’s bitcoin so who knows 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:19

I make about the same as you and was putting $20 a week into BTC 2 years ago about a year ago I believe it was $450 a coin and I sold my coin. Regrets man regrets, don't ever sell but I bought back in at 4000 a coin and made $600 so I feel better

lol i’ve known of btc and ltc since 2013 and this week my co worker came in and said “hey any of you ever heard of bitcoin”  facepalm
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:53:32
its so lame how they disable buying on certain things all they do is fuck shit up
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:55:36
so I put in $500 and it turned to $1800 I report I made $1300?
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:13:57
I’m only 22 so i’ve never done my own taxes (parents do that shit for me) but I thought if you didn’t make more than 10-20k you didn’t have to report? I use to sell on ebay for a while and if you didn’t make more than 20,000 with paypal transactions you didn’t have to report. so why report if you only make a few grand with coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:55:04
I got a whole $10 :) glad I sold all my btc before this "fork" .... can never win lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:52
yeah except they gave me $5 which is now $9?
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:58:51
let that bitcoin sit for 4 years by then it’ll be worth so much more then fly to another country and cash out
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:19:39
always a sad time to add up your old bitcoin and realize you’d be a millionaire if you held.. ah well can’t always dwell

just checked his account, a month ago he transferred 50 btc to his bank (400k) and seeing as he been hodling for years that probably isn’t even half of his stock so i think he’s set, sucks he lost that tho
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:50:28
why u asking this subs advice? clearly everyone answer is HODL and you failed to listen to that part, why listen now? never panic sell man
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:36

india will be fine with bitcoin when the price goes back up and after they take everyone’s bitcoin and have 100,000+ BTC that’s when it’ll be “legal” in their country.
