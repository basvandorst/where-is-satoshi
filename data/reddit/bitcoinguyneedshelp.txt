Well, I was unaware that those other transactions were still pending so I'm concerned that this wallet is somehow in limbo.  This is just an assumption I guess because I do not understand the fundamentals of system or the program (Electrum).

Okay, I guess I have really screwed up but in the end it will somehow work out.
I still need to make this payment, however, and I guess I don't know what to do.  Can I make a new wallet and purchase coins and begin again while this sorts out?  I am not sure how to do that in Electrum because previously I thought I was making a new wallet but it actually all went into the same wallet I had so i guess I only made new addresses.  What method should I use to make a new wallet and still keep this one?
thanks very much!

Yes, I am unfamiliar with that method, but willing to try it if it means the difference between losing the coins...
How long can I expect to wait?  I haven't heard of any transaction taking this long before.  Any idea how long the coins could be in limbo?  hours?  days?
Thanks for the help.

Okay, thank you!

I think I can get the money automatically refunded to me so I am not concerned with the possible loss, but I just want to be sure to have a wallet that is totally separate from this one since it's seeming like it could be several days.  Luckily, I have enough to cover the time waiting but I cannot really miss making this payment for another day.

Man, I screwed up.  Does my computer need to be on during this time or is it already past the point of that making a difference?
One other thing: I have the wallet on my laptop too and that has been open as well and I have checked it through there.  Could there be an issue around that?  I have been reading about some "wallet surgery" methods but do not understand what they mean or when to attempt them.  I guess I'm wondering if my payment is indeed out there and if that is all I can do about it.
What should the transaction fee be set at? .00005? .0005?
Thanks again.

Okay, well you guys were correct and the coins came back to me minus the transaction fees.  I don't understand how the transaction fees work.  I've heard somewhere that you can adjust them to pay less.  If that is so, why would you pay more voluntarily?
Also, this was even more of a noob move because I used mBTC instead of BTC so I actually only sent less than a dollar....
One other thing I was wondering is that it still keeps making confirmations on the previous transfers.  When does it stop, or am I supposed to stop it manually?
Thanks for the help!

how long will this take and when will i know it's done? it's still going...

I'm showing -1.05376 in red font under "Amount" and a I'm not sure what that means.  Both transactions have the green check next to them.  Does this mean that I should just leave the computer on and the coins will return minus the transaction fee on their own?
I'm hesitant to post the tx ID because I don't want to put my real identity on reddit and these coins came from coinbase straight to my electrum wallet then to the reciever.  I'm feeling like an idiot because i have used coinbase a few times but never used my own wallet so I didn't know what to expect.
From your responses it seems like I'll get some  coin back and the recipient will get his coins as well.  Am I safe in thinking this?  I'll definitely do some more research before I venture into this further but for now I'm hoping to not lose my coins..  Is it possible that the recipient will get the balance of the coins from the transaction that has insufficient funds?
So, the best thing to do would be to wait, right?  Thanks for any help guys.

Hi, I'm now showing 47 confirmations and it appears that the balance has returned to me for the entire amount minus the transaction fees.  How can I be sure that it is done attempting to send?  I want to resend the payment but I do not want to have the same thing happen again.  I don't know how to tell if the transaction has completed doing whatever it was doing.  Thanks
