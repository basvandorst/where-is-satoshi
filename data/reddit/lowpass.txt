Proposed dangers/solutions in video:
1. Cryptography is broken. Solution: change cryptographic algorithm. Yes, possible, but requires a hard fork. Sure, maybe you think it's not a big deal. How many people still use IE6?
2. Quantum computing. Solution: QC-resistant algorithms. Problem: none of the QC-resistant algorithms are really strong. Theoretical, anyway.
3. Taking 50% of network. Solution: "It's too big" -- what? Ghash had &gt;50% not too long ago.
4. Make Bitcoin illegal. "It's not possible" -- again, what? Sure it is. Making something illegal is not the same as shutting it down entirely. That's incredibly naïve. However, making it illegal can influence people's decision to use it or not. Would you really want to store any significant amount of value in something that could be seized at any time?

Yeah, that's true.
What about if you had a pool of public keys?  Let's say n keys.  You could make a transaction that is like a 1+1-of-n.
The 1+ is a key of yours.  The n keys are those of possible merchants.  The transaction is broadcast and confirmed.
Now to spend it, you give the merchant your key.  They use yours and theirs to "unlock" the funds and send them elsewhere.
You can't double spend because you only know the solution to one key: the list of public keys could be verified against an impartial third party, and if any are suspicious then the transaction is denied.
Some problems:
1. The transactions are for pre-specified amounts, so you need to trust that they'll give you change.
2. There's no way to get your funds back*.
3. The transactions would wind up quite large, depending on the number of public keys you reference.
4. You have to pre-plan to some degree where your funds will go.
But in terms of quick transactions I think it would work.  It's basically automatic escrow (without the possibility of a chargeback); rather than a third party that needs to deliberate, the merchant just decides whether or not they trust your list of public keys.
\*I suppose you could request that merchant to unlock it and send them back to you, but that requires you trust them to do so.

I'm sure someone somewhere has given a prediction that will turn out to be true.  Truth is, it could settle at 200, it could crash and burn, or the world's national currencies could collapse and bitcoin reign supreme, skyrocketing to millions per btc.
Nobody knows.


Honestly, probably not; I would see us post-scarcity before it could ever happen.  But who knows?


Even more ubiquitous computing. Physical bitcoins are technically possible but at this point they're just a hindrance.  It's far easier to just look at a QR code with your Google™ Transparent Aluminum 5® and think "spend".


Arguably, government regulation.  They can't really shut it down, but they sure could make it illegal.

Transactions are verified by means of a [script](  1+1-of-n would only be a bit more complex than m-of-n, which itself is handled almost entirely by one command: OP_CHECKMULTISIG
You can't eat and run at (e.g.) a fast food restaurant where you pay upfront.
And this is different than plain escrow; escrow would be too slow for a fast transaction like this, and still has the issue of a possible double-spend.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:01:15
But then you have to create the transaction right then and there, and you have to wait for confirmation.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:50:14
Couldn't a script be designed so that the transaction doesn't go to a particular address, but there is some computationally hard problem that must be solved to spend it.  This is broadcast and confirmed ahead of time.  Then, to spend it, you give the other party the solution.  Because it was already confirmed, they have the funds right away and can make a new transaction to send them to a secure address.
.. I suppose that just adds a tiny bit of separation; one could still annul the second transaction and use the solution to send them somewhere else.

This article is flawed.
1. The author doesn't understand what quantum computing is.  It doesn't just "address more data at a time".
2. Bitcoins are not "generated only as computers break codes to unlock them" -- they're generated by finding a number that, when added to the block, causes the hash to fit a certain form.  Whether or not this particular aspect of bitcoin is susceptible to quantum computing attacks, I'm not sure.
3. The real threat is in the addresses (or more specifically, the public/private key pair) -- it's ECDSA-based, which is crackable with quantum computing.  So, if you reuse an address, your BTCs are at risk.
4. The fact that there's post-quantum cryptography doesn't matter since the ECDSA part is integral to the Bitcoin protocol.  Change that and you're making something altogether new.

@_date: 2013-10-28 18:54:04
Yep. To get a bit more technical:
A transaction consists of two parts: inputs and outputs.  There can be one or more of both of them.
Each input has a few different parts, among them (1) a reference to another transaction (the unspent one) and (2) a "scriptSig" -- this is the signature and public key I mentioned above.  There's also data about the size of the transaction, and a lock timer that's kinda neat, but I won't go over it now.
Each output has a few different parts also, among them (1) the amount of bitcoin for this output and (2) a script.
Not an address.  A script.
A typical output script looks something like this:
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;pubKeyHash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
If you look at [a random transaction]( you'll see that at the bottom (if not, click "Show scripts &amp; coinbase")
The pubKeyHash is the hash of the public key (an address is just this in another form -- you can convert from address to pubKeyHash and vice versa).
In the verification, the scriptSig from an input is combined with the script from the referenced output and run.  If the ultimate output of this is true, then it's accepted.  If not, it's rejected.  You can see an example of a script "running" [here](
I mentioned that's a typical output script -- if you know what you're doing, you can write your own output scripts. As a really simple example, let's say you wanted to send money to anyone who knew the password "password".
Your output script might be something like this:
    
    OP_SHA256 5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8 OP_EQUALVERIFY
5e88... is the SHA-256 hash of "password".
To spend this transaction, someone else would just refer to it and set their scriptSig to "password".  Then, in the process of verification, the output script would take "password", hash it, compare it to the given hash, and if they're equal, return true.
If someone set their scriptSig to "foobar", that OP_SHA256 would spit out c3ab8ff13720e8ad9047dd39466b3c8974e592c2fa383d4a3960714caef0c4f2, and the OP_EQUALVERIFY would return false.

But you'd never have been able to bet so much in the first place.

Most, if not all, bitcoin competitors are just forks of Bitcoin -- they're essentially identical, except they might change some element here or there. Litecoin, for example, changes the block rate (~2.5min instead of 10), uses scrypt instead of SHA-256, and caps out at 84mil instead of 21mil.

@_date: 2013-10-28 17:04:44
First things first: wallets do not really store bitcoins.  They store private keys, which have corresponding public keys, which can be hashed to find addresses.
The block chain is essentially a long list of transactions.  A transaction can be "spent" or "unspent" -- if you send 5 btc from address A to address B, that means:
1. Address A had at least 5btc worth of unspent transactions into it.  It could have been one transaction of 10btc, or 5 transactions of 1btc -- whatever, however many, as long as the total is at least 5btc.
2. When the A-&gt;B transaction takes place, those unspent transactions into A are marked as spent.
3. If the total marked as spent are more than the amount being sent from A-&gt;B, then there is change.  Another address is generated (from a newly generated new private key) -- let's call it C.  The transaction is now technically from A to both B and C.
4. B now has an unspent 5btc transaction, and C has whatever the change was.
Therefore, your wallet "balance" is actually just the sum of all unspent transactions that target addresses the wallet has keys for.
All this to say: generate a new private key/public key/address, put the private key on the flash drive, and send the money to that address.  The flash drive does not actually have money on it; it has, essentially, a claim ticket.
Essentially equivalently, save a backup of a bitcoin-qt wallet onto the flash drive, then delete it all from the computer.  The backup is just your private keys.

I question the truth of that, at least at this stage.  The block reward is huge in relation to the transaction fees.
The three most recent blocks (as of writing this) had .37331, .23397, and .6689001 BTC in transaction fees.  The last one (which had an unusually high number of transactions) is only about 2% of the reward -- and considering blocks are almost certainly going to be mined by large pools, that's a miniscule change.
So, yes, as the reward gets smaller, the fees will play a larger part ... but that's a ways out right now.

Where'd you get the 4000 number?  The block structure allows up to 9 bytes for the transaction counter -- 2^(8*9) = 4.7 x 10^21
Obviously right now that's pretty much impossible for a number of reasons (one: if each transaction is about 500bytes, one block with the max number of transactions would be nearly 2 yottabytes), but the point is the capacity is there.
4000 transactions (at ~500B per) would only be about 2MB, so it's not a size issue.

Just a note: this is (at least partly) why change is sent to a new address by default, and not back to the sending address.  That way, when you announce the address's public key, there's nothing there to steal anyway.
Edit: ~~this also makes me think it's a good idea to have a way to automatically move bitcoins off of an address as soon as you get them.  Major public addresses (e.g. SatoshiDice's) would be prime targets.  Just the 50% address right now has about 22BTC sitting in it.~~ realized this wouldn't make a difference; if someone else has the private key they could just set their system up to redirect BTCs the same way, and then it's a race to see who gets it first.  in a quantum computing world, addresses would be 100% not reusable.  what a hassle.
Not that this is a worry for anytime soon.

1. Blockchain size. You mentioned the block size, but I think you meant it in a different way (i.e. blocks can only hold so many transactions). Right now, the blockchain is nearing 12GB.  Increasing activity will only make this rise even faster.  In the long run, it could become impractical to store this on your average computer, leading to the need to keep trimmed versions (e.g. only keeping track of unspent transactions), which reduce the security of the system as a whole.  That said, storage also gets cheaper all the time, so it's a matter of which wins the race.
2. Quantum computers could make reusing addresses dangerous, which would be terribly inconvenient.  The protocol is extensible enough to handle it, but right now I'm not sure there exists a really secure, QC-proof digital signature algorithm.
3. Though ***extremely*** unlikely, one stray hash collision could cause someone to lose some bitcoin through no fault of their own.
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:32:42
Well, that's wrong.  What actually happens:
1. Bob sends his address to Alice.
2. Alice adds Bob's address and the amount of bitcoins to transfer to a transaction.
3. Alice signs the transaction with her private key.
4. Alice broadcasts the transaction on the Bitcoin network for all to see.
then, to spend:
1. Bob creates a transaction with Alice's transaction as an input.
2. Bob adds his public key to the transaction and signs it with his private key.
3. The public key is hashed and compared to the address in Alice's transaction, and the signature is checked to ensure Bob is the one creating the transaction.
in that link, "scriptPubKey" would be a piece of Alice's transaction, and "scriptSig" would be a piece of Bob's transaction that references Alice's.

One of the more popular ways of "gaming" it is the Martingale betting system.  Essentially, with 50/50 odds, if you lose, double your bet.  That way if you win, you make back what you lost and win what you would've won the first time.  If you lose again, double again, and repeat 'til you win.

Con: your bets go up exponentially, so let's say you bet 1BTC initially and then do lose six times in a row.  You're now betting 64BTC (after having already bet a total of 63BTC), chasing down that 1BTC profit.
Oh, and by the way, the fact that you've already lost 6 times doesn't matter.  Now you're betting 64BTC for fifty/fifty odds at a net gain (overall) of 1BTC.
And then, even if you DO have a fuckton of bitcoins to play around with, in the SatoshiDice case there's an upper limit of under 500BTC for the 50/50 shot -- and the payoff isn't even a straight 1:1.  Long term, the strategy fails.

Did not explicitly say that, but yes, bitcoin can change algorithms.  Not sure this would be necessary but you could even denote the address type by the [prefix](
The address itself is a hash.  This is essentially unbreakable, and the reason bitcoin already has some QC resistance.  The problem comes when you spend your coins from that address -- to do so, you announce that you own the address by showing your public key and signing a transaction.  The public key is used to verify the signature and also compared against the address.  Because the actual public key is now out there, it could be used (with QC) to find the private key.

Sure, maybe it will. Maybe it will get 100% (ha).
But you have no way of knowing. You do the calculation, and then forget the whole "if".
Well, in your case, you didn't -- but you just throw in another random number. You even admit "exact value not important", but it is. You picked 10%. Why should I believe Bitcoin has a 10% chance of being used for 1% of the world's transactions?  1% is a huge number on a global scale. 1% of the world's population is 71.3 MILLION people.
Since the "exact value [is] not important", why not.. 1%? Because then your estimate is only $240, and that's nowhere near as impressive.

This means that you back up the wallet once, and even if you make more addresses in the future, it won't matter because they can all be produced from that backup. By contrast, bitcoin-qt has to be backed up whenever you make a new address.  You would still probably want more than one backup, but you don't need to backup periodically.

I think you were assuming that fees are incentivized, and therefore there must be some limit (otherwise how would they be incentivized).  Right now, there's not really an incentive.  Miners are primarily doing it for the 25 generated coins, not the fees.
Transaction fees are actually mandatory for transactions below a certain limit.  This limit is determined through a calculation based on the number of coins being transacted, the size of the transaction, and how long you've had the coins.
1BTC that is one day old would be able to transfer fee-free, if the sender so wished.  This limit can also change with new client releases.
Once all the coins are generated (and perhaps even before), miners will be more motivated by the fees -- and in that case, miners might prefer to avoid low-fee transactions.
Also, I suppose I misled you... Right now, there is actually a block size limit (of 250kb) -- however, this can be increased without requiring a hard fork.

[Generating public key &amp; private key manually](
[Going from public key to address](
All of this is already done automatically by whatever client you're using.  Any time you make a new address (in bitcoin-qt, under "receive coins" there's a "New Address" button, even), it's doing all of that.
To put it on the USB drive, if it was something you generated yourself -- paste the key in a txt file or something and put it on the drive.  If you go through a btc client, there should be a backup option; that just backs up the private keys.

I was thinking about a case where you're trying to buy something at a physical store.  You don't want to just be standing at a register for ten minutes while it confirms (longer if you want better assurance).  You probably visit some stores/restaurants pretty often -- just include them in your public key list.
As for the transaction size, I suspect there'd be a way to sort of compress all the public keys into one number through some sort of mathematical cleverness, but I'm not sure.
If you're spending elsewhere, then yeah, you've gotta wait.  At least this speeds things up in some predictable cases.
I agree with KIND_DOUCHEBAG, I can't see how a secure zero-confirmation trust-free transaction would work.  Any zero-confirmation transaction could be spent elsewhere, and if the blockchain goes that way, the original merchant is SOL.  Hence I focused my thoughts on how to have a secure transaction be pre-confirmed but still broadly usable.

1. You're printing out way too many digits.
2. Coincidentally, you also don't use enough digits for the multiplier.  SatoshiDice gives to the thousandth -- why do you round it to the hundredth?
3. This doesn't take fees into account.
4. Your balance can go negative.
4. Frankly, it's of questionable value.  You could have different "strategies" (e.g. martingale) to add something.

Click through a bit more.
* NTRU
    &gt; NTRUSign is not a zero-knowledge signature scheme and a transcript of signatures leaks information about the private key, as first observed by Gentry and Szydlo. Nguyen and Regev demonstrated in 2006 that for the original unperturbed NTRUSign parameter sets an attacker can recover the private key with as few as 400 signatures.
* GGH
    &gt; 1999 Nguyen showed at the Crypto conference that the GGH encryption scheme has a flaw in the design of the schemes. He showed that every ciphertext reveals information about the plaintext and that the problem of decryption could be turned into a special closest vector problem much easier to solve than the general CVP.
* UOV
    &gt;Problems of this signature scheme are the key-lengths. The public key is a whole equations system. Someone who wants to verify a signature needs all  equations to compute  and compare it with the original message. **The public key is in the range of some Kilobytes.**
The UOV scheme is a young digital signature scheme. Some attacks are known and prevented at present[citation needed], but certainly in the next years other attacks will follow. The actual state of the art can't be used for commercial purposes.
* Hash-based signatures
    This is what is currently used... but because you have to announce the public key when you use an address, it fails after one use.
* McEliece / Niederreiter
    &gt; Information set decoding algorithms have turned out to be the most effective attacks against the McEliece and Niederreiter cryptosystems. [...] Since the attack is embarrassingly parallel (no communication between nodes is necessary), it can be carried out in days on modest computer clusters.
There's a reason post-quantum cryptosystems aren't already in use: they're not adequate yet.

to answer your first question:
if you're looking it up on blockchain.info, b6a9c8c230722b7c748331a8b450f05566dc7d0f is the "Hash 160"* of the public key.  you have the source string (hello) so you could construct a transaction to verify that far, at least.
however, you would also need to sign the transaction, and as you don't have the private key corresponding to the public key "hello", you can't.
\* "Hash 160" is shorthand for SHA-256 then RIPEMD-160

First of all, useful quantum computers, especially ones powerful enough to break ECDSA, are a long way off.
Second, as AgentME noted, SHA256 is a hashing algorithm, which isn't encryption.  Essentially a hash takes any amount of data and produces a constant-size output (256 bits in this case).  So you could take a 1TB file, hash it, and still get just 256 bits.  Clearly something is suspect here -- there are 2^256 combinations for the hash, while 1TB of data has 2^2^43 (if my math is right) combinations.  At the very least, couldn't two different 1TB files produce the same 256-bit hash?  Yes.  This is called a collision.  They are quite rare in general (to steal a quote from a stackoverflow post: "If you run the numbers, you'll see that all harddisks ever produced on Earth can't hold enough 1MB files to get a likelihood of a collision of even 0.01% for SHA-256.") -- they are even more rare if you're trying to find a collision with a specific hash.
There is also work towards quantum-resistant encryption methods, though right now they seem to be progressing about as well as quantum computers themselves.
Also, bitcoin as-is is already somewhat QC-proof; it's just inconvenient (since you could never reuse an address).
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:36:28

1. Armory is open source; browse the source code.
2. You could also make one yourself. Just generate a private key (and corresponding address), print it off, and send your money into it.  If you want (as far as I can tell) impeccable security without having to read the source code for everything you use:
  1. Generate the key on a fresh OS install
  2. Never connect the box to the internet
  3. Once you're done, write over the hdd with junk data about six times, then smash it all with a hammer.

The only things on the network are (1) the address, and (2) the public key, if you've spent coins.
Here's the deal with the keys: when you spend a transaction, you sign the new one with your private key, and broadcast the signature along with your public key.  The public key can be used to verify the signature -- that is, there is an algorithm that, with the signature, the public key, and the transaction itself as input, will return "true" if the signature was indeed produced with the public key's private counterpart, and false otherwise.
Also, the public key can be hashed to produce the address.  So there's a two-part verification:
1. Does the "to" address of the unspent transaction match the address you get by hashing the public key specified in the new transaction?
2. Do the new transaction and its signature pass verification with the public key?
If those are both yes, the transaction is valid and accepted into the block.
The crux of this is that the PRIVATE key is (ideally) never known to anyone other than the owner of the address.  The PRIVATE key is used to produce the signature -- the public key just checks it.  Hence, if you don't know the private key for a given address, you can't spend any coins sent to it.
