use gdax, they are the exchange for coinbase and it can save you quite a bit of money based on their fees. You just supply your coinbase wallet with funds like normal and then transfer your funds over to gdax, which you can log into with your coinbase account.

BU's greatest flaw is with an unlimited blocksize, eventually only those who can keep a super high speed connection can even hope to keep up with the newest large blocks propogating through the network. Imagine if you have to download blocks that are progressively getting larger and this amount is determined by miners. Guess what. Eventually the average person can't afford to support or verify the network and you essentially have a very centralized looking system with only big time miners and companies controlling what blocks are accepted because they're the only ones who can feasibly keep up. Also, a larger block means longer propogation time through the network which means a miner can get an even larger head start than what is currently possible when mining the next block. That'd snowball into a huge advantage for any mining group with greater hashing power than all other mining groups.

I'm actually more curious if that is static or dynamic. If the value of bitcoin were to skyrocket or plummet, you have an issue if that is static. If it plummets, suddenly you can't use Lightning Channel to buy general inexpensive things such as meals (in which case Lightning Channel wouldn't even be all that useful as the blockchain might not be maxed out). If the price skyrockets for btc, suddenly .042 btc might be able to buy things priced over or around 100 dollars which means as the price of BTC grows, so does the upper bound of what can be transacted on a single Lightning Network channel (I'm still very new to this so don't mistake this post for anything but conjecture...). I'm really curious about this .042 btc value now...

From what I understand, sticking with SegWit and the current direction of Core, we see that we are leaning towards off-chain solutions.
What this means is these off chain solutions can take revenue away from on-chain transaction fees, which is  the current way the bitcoin protocol currently works to support miners on top of the block reward. 
If you think about it that way, it makes sense for the miners to not support the core team from taking a large chunk of their potential earnings away, and therefore do not support SegWit and are looking for any alternative solution.
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:27:55
Can you elaborate how miners will benefit with the cumulative transaction fees per block increase? I'm not well versed in Lightning Network but I'm guessing your suggesting that on-chain transaction fees will go up because of the additional security and value of being on-chain with the growth of user-base due to benefits of off-chain transactions.

I know specs are useful when comparing the two implementations, but does anyone have any real data on the differences between a successful implementation of BTC Core and BU? There are a ton of variables here, but if the miners want to talk money then we should talk money. Someone here has to have some reasonable, data-driven estimate of miner return value of each implementation in best/worst case.

I know this is a joke but the thought of this guy reading half way through this book to only then realize it is not about bitcoin is dumb as hell. It's clearly a picture of a book on display in a bookstore that he never read, but this is still the lowest quality content I've seen here, and that's saying something.

That's not really true as any time you buy anything with bitcoin and your same belief of bitcoin value going up holds true, it'd be the same thing. The guy who spent all those bitcoins on 2 papa john's pizzas way back when was essentially getting a good deal based on the current value of bitcoin. If anyone buys anything with bitcoin using your current understanding, everyone will shudder as the price goes up and they realise what they could have had. The truth is money is generally more valuable to the average person now rather than later. These crypto currencies are unique in that their valuation is continuously shifting and recently been growing.
The best way to show you you're wrong is if you had played the casino with fiat. In retrospect, you could have just bought bitcoin with fiat and, according to your understanding, eventually regret you didn't buy bitcoin. When you spend the bitcoin or money is when it holds the 1:1 ratio between fiat and bitcoin, and in the same vein you could have amplified your winnings had you won (in the future by keeping your winnings in btc assuming the same model of btc price going up)

I suggest you look more into proof of stake because you're asking the basics of it. I'm glad to answer your question though because it is somewhat hard to find.
So mining is proof of work, you can prove that a certain amount of work went into finding the next block. In proof of stake, you can prove that a certain amount of cryptocurrency was staked and therefore recycled back into the system to find the next block. Having more cryptocurrency helps your chances at finding the next block. Essentially the idea is with proof of stake, there's not a lot you can do to help your chances finding the next block other than having more at stake, aka having more cryptocurrency, and therefore being more favorable in finding the next block. 
It's part of the algorithm to look at how much is being staked, the current minimum difficulty, and if the hash satisfies these conditions and others for the next block. The difficulty of the next block is reduced by an amount proportional to the cryptocurrency you are staking while your computer tries to find the next block (but in terms of finding, it's not doing that much computational work relative to a PoW coin). Even if you bring the difficulty down to zero, you are not guaranteed to find the next block. It definitely helps having more at stake because you are more likely to not have missed out on a successful stake because the difficulty was higher than what your staking machine could produce, but otherwise would have been a perfectly fine solution. Keep in mind there is very little variability that your computer can do to increase your chances (other than a small range of hashing that is very doable on low end computers) because the real most helpful factor is amount at stake.

@_date: 2017-09-19 21:30:00
nah not actually. Believe it or not, you don't necessarily need a competition of computational power. You just need an algorithm that chooses a block validator at random and that a lot of people are vying to be the one to next validate the block and that no one should ever have a huge advantage over others (think 51% attack) in a distributed system. Ethereum is moving toward PoS, or so I heard months ago so what do I know. I'm going to shamelessly plug PIVX here for you if you want to take a look at it. It's just a baby but it has potential. It will soon be the first Proof of Stake privacy coin.

Bitcoin makes you want to save for a brighter, speculative future. It's like buying anything you hope and believe will go up in value: you just want more and more of it for the future.

Well, that would take time to setup and requires a partnership with an ASIC mining machine company which is for the most part just Ant Miners currently. Then there's also the absurd amount of capital and logistics that would go into that for it to be worth it. You're arguing something that implies someone wants to lose all their money and also has enough money to out compete the entire mining ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:13:42
This is probably falling on deaf ears, but you don't need to have a competing miner infrastructure for a blockchain technology to work. You can just give participants a token each that they use that is randomly selected to validate the next block in the chain by the algorithm that is not proof of work, but something closer to proof of stake. In corporate settings, they could implement some type of ico between all participants and once the system is working, the token isn't worth anything in itself, but is instead just a way of proving you are a valid actor/stake holder in the current blockchain. This is kind of like proof of stake but the reward mechanism isn't designed to help participants gain more tokens, it's designed to just secure a distributed and transparent ledger that all participants can hopefully now trust.
Note: I'm talking less about cryptocurrency implementations and more about information blockchains

Reddit is just a bunch of keyboard warriors like myself who don't know enough but spew rhetoric like it's fact. This sub is full of it. As long as bitcoin price goes up, it's a huge circle jerk. Going down? It's a support circle with hodl signs everywhere. I feel like most people here like to be victimized when the issue at hand really has very little do with them at all, even more so because they don't understand it.

they'd have to be buying up mining farms now and 100 billion dollars is not pocket change for the 1% unless you're suggesting they'd all somehow have a meeting and pool their resources, all just to lose all that money when they sink Bitcoin OR inadvertently legitimizing it even more?

You mean to say every time you say which team is going to win a game that you called it? I bet you're just like the rest of us and "call it" only when you were actually right, and never when you were actually wrong. Those times, you just.... pretend you never said them....
That being besides the point, you didn't call anything. You predicted that a wildly volatile market would be volatile and you happened to pick down rather than up. Hell, maybe you "called it" back when it was at 1500, in which case, you didn't call shit. Either way, this is some stupid post you wrote trying to validate yourself. Congratulations.

I think you should probably understand these problems if you are trying to promote and setup bitcoin for local merchants...these are very important things to know so you can appropriately explain to potential local merchants the benefits and current problems with Bitcoin. They'll probably get pissed off if you don't let them know up front about the high fees and slow block times, more so if you can't explain why. I mean to say, you should already know these things if you are so far invested as being part of and promoting a bitcoin startup.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:54:36
It is always a good time to buy if you believe bitcoin will go up and it's always a bad time to buy if you believe bitcoin will go down. You're trading on emotion which is bad and you expect someone else to make the decision for you. Who cares what I or anyone else says. No one knows. If you believe in crypto then hold, otherwise you're more concerned about having 6 dollars today than you are about having  4 dollars today and a belief you will have 20 dollars in a few days/months/year....

yes, but in terms of disk space, you can see how increasing throughput and therefore increasing the amount of the blockchain you have to download every 10 minutes is effectively a blocksize increase. You'd also have to consider the repercussions on the PoW difficulty (short term issue) and speed of block propogation through the network. Propogating these blocks through the network will most likely not break anything, but it does give a greater head start to some of these miners although Litecoin, as an example, doesn't seem to have issue with it.

Because 100 doesn't make sense and at some point it's easier to set a goal in terms of btc instead of usd. 21 btc would reap the benefits of a highly successful cryptocurrency (should that happen). if you're looking for any psychological milestone, this one is or at least has been attainable and holds significance because of the aforementioned. Also, people throw around the idea of joining the 21 club for added incentive and sense of exclusivity in the bitcoin space.
