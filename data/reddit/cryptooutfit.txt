Sounds good I didn't think of that! However, I think there's already a community going under that name.
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:03:51
It definitely does! I fell in love with it personally when I saw the first sample :) Thanks!

I designed the shirts this way so they can fit with any outfit and still look good. I would say that's having fashion in mind. I've had people mistake the shirt for designer due to the quality of the shirt/embroidery and because they didn't know anything about crypto lol

Yes you can purchase with Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrency accepted through Coinbase commerce :)

Had the same thought about other shirts too which a reason I designed these this way.
Thanks for the encouraging words! :)

I understand, thanks for your comment.
I have settled with this price point due to the costs of making such a product at this quality. The shirts are made using 100% Ringspun Cotton and Embroidered within the UK. They are actually also branded (new brand but slowly building it up) with custom packaging as you can see here  
Without including what it would have cost to design/sample all of this and to stock and process the orders within a fulfillment warehouse (to allow for cheap and fast shipping worldwide) the COP is already quite high.
There's a 25% discount at the moment using Code: BULL2019 if you're interested. Thanks again :)

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have and any advice is greatly appreciated. 
Personally, I wear these shirts all the time and have had many positive encounters and they have started many great conversations.

I simply did not have the budget to stock these sizes. Hopefully, I will be able to provide them in the future.

People tend to be interested in what others around them are interested in. To speed up the adoption of Bitcoin and other CC innovators need to step up and take a lead. Heres an interesting page about adoption
I created these shirts in the thought of this. By wearing them around I've found a lot of people asking me what it is, leading to conversations and me teaching them what I know. It's like brand awareness but for Bitcoin, the more people see it around the greater it'll pique their interest.

haha I will make sure I am able to stock these sizes as soon as possible and will let you know! :)

Haha those pyramid schemes rly do put a bad image on Bitcoin but at least it has helped people become more aware of how to spot and avoid them. Also, I believe people who don't see the worth in Bitcoin and think of it as only an algorithm simply don't know enough about it and its use cases.

Let me know what you think about the prices, I currently have a discount code (BULL2019) for 25% off putting them at £26.25. Pretty decent for what you're getting but people have still mentioned it being steep.
Check us out on Insta too @
