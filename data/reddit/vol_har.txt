A positive bounce? If more people short than shouldn't that result in a drop? 
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:49:25
Could be the decision has already been taken, but not announced

Stuff like this:
Liquidated short on XBTUSD: Buy 7,003 @ 6125.5
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:19:48
Does this mean the price is settled at market close on Thursday or at what time? 
Been looking at btc chart and  it looks like the price starts rising again after each Thursday at around 6 o clock 
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:24:05
Ah like that. But doesn't that all depend on their price target?
Would be better if the price rises without the shorts and they're forced to buy

Is there also a daily deadline (office hours/trading hours) before/after which the SEC has to make statements?
Want to leave the house tonight, but I'm not going if I know there's a chance they accept/decline today.
I assume the decision will be made in NY, so I hope 1700/1800 eastern time at the latest.
Can anyone shed a light on this?

Would like to know the same thing

Two questions before I buy:
1)Is it possible to show two prices: say BTC+ETH?
2)Is it possible to show your favorite exchanges' price?

Thanks. True, this looks smooth xapart from the coindesk promo

2 questions: 
-what site do you use for graphs? Trading view?
-how does one connect more than 2 screens om 1 pc? I use 4 screens, but use 2 pc's and therefore 2x keyboard/mouse. Would love to use one mouse for all screens
 
@_date: 2018-10-24 00:28:19
Thanks for the reply. Do you need special software for this? My pc only recognizes two screen. Have room for 3
@_date: 2018-10-24 00:39:40
I think i have a vga+dvi output from graphics card and a vga+dvi from motherboard. For my 2 screens I'm using both graphic cards' outputs.
I believe someone once told me you can't use both graphic card AND motherboard outputs.
If that ks correct i have to make a setup like your's and buy a shitty second graphics card (it's not for games or anything, so the quality can be poor) 
PS What do you mean by crossfire
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:30:53
Do you know the dates of the current two offered futures? I believe one is from cboe and the other one I don't know. 
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:29:38
Will this affect open orders?
@_date: 2019-02-27 04:16:26
But never to fiat? No regrets? 
@_date: 2019-02-27 03:30:12
Did you sell any since 2013?
@_date: 2019-06-09 00:26:06
What about its use in science?
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:05:06
Hi eddy, can you give me a source for this part?
"The biggest problem is that the Dutch Supervisors on bank activity, AFM and DNB, already came with negative advice.
The statement from AFM is that regular banks never can work together with crypto. If they do it, then they will give the impression that you can trust crypto."
Dutch source is ok, thanks!
