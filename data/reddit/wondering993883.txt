No lol, they are literally using Bitcoin for everyday transactions as the de facto currency. Toilet paper, water, wages, etc.

Certainly good, it will open up more conversations about Bitcoin gainz between friends, friends of friends. The more exposure, the better. Until U.S. gov makes a move.

We can look at this a few ways. First, this is all complete speculation for you and you've made the absolute worst possible choice already. Chances are if you do the complete opposite of what you're advising, you win, since you inherently make such bad decisions.
Two, you're a sadist and wish to troll some poor newbie who actually sells his stash during a dip in a bull run.
Three, you're being manipulated by whales to sell and they eat all of your nom noms. Maybe you *are* a whale trying to eat my nom noms.
Nearly **everyone** believes it's going up. The only thing pushing it down are institutions on purpose, cartel-like pump/dump groups, and they're feeding off of people trying to day trade.
Either way, this just adds more confidence in HODL strategy.

I've thought about this too, but guessing that half of them will probably hold, and that institutions are beginning to buy, it isn't enough to stop the run. Plus news coverage, people pulling the trigger who missed the last run, etc.. They haven't been carrying the bags for that long really.
Another thought - ethereum is dirt cheap right now as far as ratios between BTC and ETH go.

This is sort of what I think is going to happen, why do you say no? Not that any of us really know, but I think most of us will agree that it will continue to increase in value forever.

This is an insightful simple perspective.

Real question, when this train crashes and let's say we're at an ATH of let's say $140,000, can this contribute to triggering a stock market crash?

Everyone make sure to do their daily "what is bitcoin" and "bitcoin price" searches to trik bots!

We are so unbelievably early in the bull run. These dips are from desperate market manipulation that won't last much longer. It's large groups of whales eating up the day traders and the few selling for a break-even. They will eventually own everything that was left to manipulate. Then moon. Then panic sell.
If you own 10 Bitcoins that's like 1/1,000,000 of a **valuable, deflationary, global** **asset**. It doesn't take many of you holding to nudge the market up.
Further, if you sell, you're just fulfilling your own (short term) prophecy because you added to a limited number of Bitcoins on the market.
We still have yet to benefit from exponential news coverage and adoption.
Worst case scenario you wait till after moon and the bottom support is between 8k-13k. Like shit it's the national currency of Venezuela. Probably a few others by now too. **COUNTRIES.**
What if large financial institutions start dipping their feet in more on Monday? It's the weekend... they don't make decisions like this on the weekend.
Look here: shorts are very low right now and decreasing
Chill tf out. If you're still worried, look into that 50,000 block HODL statistic where it's been guaranteed to make a profit at any point in history. Many people are planning on continuing their weekly purchase average strategy past previous ATH.
