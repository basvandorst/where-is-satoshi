That's what I'm saying!
Maybe this sort of platform could bring transparency to these kinds of practices?

Couldn't they pay someone for upvotes to promote something in the first place?

Cool, I was really hoping someone would rebut with this exact point. 
So, from what I understand about this website, socialism seems to be the favored system. I'm not planning on getting ideological, so hear me out: 
"Free" and "free speech" are not one in the same. Free speech is the ability to say anything you'd like, not the ability to say something without having to pay. On that same note, does Reddit really need to be free to allow free speech? 
Limited votes would be established, but only in the same way that Reddit has implemented it. One vote per post. Or comment. 
But back to your underlying point... What happened to putting your money where your mouth is? 
If you have an opinion, and you really want other people to hear that opinion, so much that you want *as many people as possible* to hear that opinion, wouldn't you pay to promote it? Isn't that the basis of advertising?

I think so too! But at the same time, if it's only one cent, how many people would even notice? IF the content is super good? Like replace paywalls with one cent instant transactions? Just thinking out loud lol.

Exactly! That's the goal. If you really care about how many people hear your opinion, then you'd better do everything in your power to promote it.

Just checked their website...Looks like shit hit the fan when Google mistook one of their posts for child pornography?

Sounds interesting, what is LN?

Yes, and the idea I had in mind would give the author a majority share of the cents. There would be a charge for site maintenance, and maybe salary for the owner if the business became time-consuming, but overall the content providers would be reaping most of the profit.

That's really cool, I'd love to talk about this more with you!
Does the system seem to work well?
I keep thinking it would be cool to cut out all the people who are here to just say stupid shit and not contribute, while at the same time reward the people who really care about having their content at the top.

That's really cool! Does the bitcoin used to vote go back to the Bitcoin website? Or the user who posted the post?
@_date: 2017-04-04 00:34:12
Good point...made me think of a couple points:
1) Could that be a good thing? People who truly care about a subject could hold more gravity in a discussion?
2) If it's a bad thing, couldn't we just cut the vote-per-post at one per person?
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:02:25
That looks cool, is there a way to view the code like codepen? I tried downloading the source but it's missing so many files, I'm not a big GitHub guy. Never had time to learn
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:06:27
I think this is a great idea, but would deter users once they ran out of votes. Technically, you can only vote once on Reddit anyway, why would we need another level of security?
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:08:52
Wellllllll....... 
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:11:24
Elaborate please?
EDIT: Just realized what I wrote in the title lol. Rookie mistake.

Can you rephrase this? It sounds like you're saying that "free" users would have the task of weeding out good content from bad content. Which sounds interesting, making the free users go through the tedious tasks. Please expand!
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:10:35
Right! So instead of holding on to reddit gold, you'd be able to hold on to a currency you could exchange for something more valuable
