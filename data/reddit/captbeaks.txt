I think monero (mymonero) uses a 13 word private key too?

The amount of times my family has asked to see my bitcoins over the past 4 years... Same people, same questions. They can’t comprehend it!��
Maybe I am crap at explaining the concept? ��

Good writing for a 4year old...

So true. 6 months ago no one was asking me about crypto. Over the past few weeks nearly every day someone new has asked me how to get involved!

My poor, poor litecoins. All alone, feeling abandoned....

Have you tried to exchange money from Australia to US or Europe before? It takes a LOT longer than 30mins...

Yep. In the U.K. 0% fee credit card, no ATM charges, no fee to use banks... I do have crypto, but can also see the above posts opinion.

Not sure about charges to vendors, but the price is the same whether I use cash, debit or credit cards.
The card providers don't run at a loss- they anticipate you will have money on the card when the 0% period expires &amp; then they get you!

I don't believe you! Do you have any pics as proof? ;)

You've misunderstood my point about the numbers. They don't mean anything without a different type of evidence to support them.
That's the issue- I really do want to believe you! On paper, there is no reason not to. However, your comments and way you come across seem to drive people to not believe you. 
Lets leave it here. Enjoy the rest of your thread &amp; enjoy the mega karma you're collecting!

If you're telling the truth, good for you and I hope you achieve your goals. A strange way to portray it though...
As for your numbers, I can make some up too! With a little research, I can even make them believable! You're obviously intelligent, so surely you realise all facts need more than one source of proof?

I was supporting you at first. Now I have read this I realise why people are hating you &amp; it's not to do with mining. You come across as very distrustful, which is not helping your cause. Maybe the best way to test your theory that this sub is run by miners is to send a mod the pics, let everyone know when &amp; who they were sent to &amp; then the mod confirms?

Coinbase does work in the U.K, as does Kraken. Other options are coinfloor and coinify (via blockchain). In most cases you now have to provide ID to get high to higher trading vol.
