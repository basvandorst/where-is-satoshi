Cointracking.info is actually more of a web client in terms of entering the data, the app just displays your balances, portfolio changes, etc.

Well the biggest rule in crypto is don't invest more than you can afford to lose. If you can't afford to lose $100, then don't put it in.
However, you seem to believe that crypto is the future of money. If that's the case, probably worth betting $100 on it.
Whether btc is the right choice, who knows. Right now it's what everyone knows so it's not going to disappear in the near future. You can always split your $100 into btc/eth/whatever to diversify.

As the other poster mentioned, if you just wrote a paper on it you're probably more versed in the potential than most who invest in it.
But either way, you're talking 100-250 here. Not to say that's not a significant amount of money, but if Bitcoin completely crashes and you lose $100 is it the end of the world? On the other hand, did your research make you believe it could go higher? If so, that $100 could multiply several times.

CME futures market launches soon. Not saying that will do it but a lot of money could be made by shorting Bitcoin futures and subsequently selling off btc.
