Thanks for the reply, now I'm wondering if I need to update my backups of that wallet.dat as it will include a new address I have coins on?

They are well known for say mining with the S7 then when they have the S9 ready they sell the S7 as if they are the latest and mine themselves with the S9.

Even if they are not required by local law, personal information is still valuable.

The number of gates in a quantum computer right now is a joke. The level of advancement they need to be considered a threat is absurd. The threat of mining BTC wallets is not a thing. Its so far in the future anybody intelligent enough to guess would know better then to try.

I worked for eBay as a supervisor and can say without question never buy anything off that site unless you pay with a credit card. If you ever have a problem the 19 year old PayPal employee who is paid fuck all and pushed so hard to close tickets as fast as they can, dose not give the slightest fuck about siding with the seller or buyer, right or wrong. They follow a rigid workflow and are just going through the gears. The only thing they care about is moving on to the next case so they can keep the shitty job they have.
Sooner or later you will get a box of rocks, bricks, usb thumb drive hot glued with some scrap iron in a Intel ssd enclosure, or whatever and its 50/50 if PayPal sides with you. The sellers "the bad ones" are much better at this game then you and have a good chance at beating you. Sooner or later they are banned but they have tons of accounts and just sell small things to buff up the feedback on new accounts prior to running scams. The cases that really trip up PayPal are the ones where the seller is just selling something as a one off and the buyer does not have a lot of purchases, but the seller still shipped a box with a rock or some garbage in it and had the shipping receipt with tracking. 
I would sooner keep my wallet.dat files in a unsecured S3 bucket then pay for eBay items with BTC.
as a point to note eBay is PayPal along with other online services like Kijiji and so on, they even has Skype at one point and made us all use it at work.
