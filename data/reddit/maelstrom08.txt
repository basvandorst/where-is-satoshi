Which is why you should let the ignorant big-blockers keep forcing the price down so that we who understand what scaling means can acquire more.

What we do know, however, is that there's room for cryptographic currencies in the future. As in market cap &gt;$1T.

Bitcoin is still pretty much in its infancy, but I guess it's hard to believe for some.

You might put a dent in one of the smaller exchanges if you market-sold. But if you even had a couple of bitcoins you'd know that and easily be able to cash out that amount without effecting the price of BTC.

Let the market sort itself out. It's still in its infancy, so it's natural for a few to manipulate prices like this. Ver will cut his losses eventually. Just make sure you're not decreasing the amount you're holding.

If that's the case you should already have 'dumped' your BTC for BCH. I'm sure you're going to be comfortable the coming days/weeks and I'm sure I'll be comfortable watching my BTC rise higher when people relize what problems that BCH solves (none). Even at the off chance of BCH being BTCs demise, it's still a shittier coin than most altcoins such as LTC, which means it doesn't have a future anyway. In which case I'll still recover quickly with my stash of LTC. Even if solid altcoins/pure cryptocurrencies with tech that is superior to that of BTC/BCH would tank, I'll still recover quickly with my stash of ETH.
BCH was doomed from start to finish as it doesn't propose, might even say 'yet' because they could theretically hardfork further down the road, a solution to the scaling problem.
Without involuntary ignorant, or paid and smart, Ver-shills like you we'd probably never have to experience these shitty situations in crypto and we probably wouldn't have wasted a couple of months on BS.

I'm sure Ver has enough money to pump BCH just when the difficulty adjusts - looks like he started too soon, though. It's going to be interesting to see what happens then. I hope I'll be able to pick up some cheap BTC.

Holy shit dude, you're good! You're almost making me sell, stop man!
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:28:57
You're really insistant on spreading FUD, nice.

I can't see your transaction yet. Are you sure you sent it to 1sdfkscjxzjasdjadklfssdlfsf?

I'm not "turning expert" and I'm not announcing how much I hold (which is why I removed all my reddit posts until a week ago), I'm just pointing out to the ~30 people who will read your comment whilst scrolling by that your post history the last 7 hours is "SELL AND BUY BACK LATER". I'm sure they'd be able to better weight your comment then.
But yes, I do hope the price dips further so that my monthly $1k deposit will yield more coins. I don't try to fuck up the community, though.

Hello there, good sir! I have a proposal just for **you**!
There's a new coin in town - killerstormcoin - and you can be part of the ICO for **just** 0.1 BTC! If you have, for example, 10 BTC 0.1 is only **1%** and there's a **chance** that you can double your 10 BTC. For 0.1 BTC!
Send the BTC to 1sdfkscjxzjasdjadklfssdlfsf and I will get back to you once the investment has been confirmed.
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:27:16
We'll see you at £100000!

Remind me of this post in Five Years when My parent's bitcoin is worth more than your 100k ltc. Capitalization due to spelling feature on phone.
