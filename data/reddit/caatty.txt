Escher hub allows users to buy and sell bitcoin quickly and for low fees. They are able to charge lower fees because they use zelle for fiat settlement, which is much more difficult to reverse than credit cards. They are able to transfer more quickly also because they use zelle for fiat settlement, because zelle settles much more quickly than ACH.
Why would merchants want to encourage this?  Because if the merchant routes the payment through a lightning channel, even if the payment starts and ends in fiat, the payment is irreversible. The payment cannot be charged back, and the processing fees for a lightning payment, even after fiat conversion, are lower than for a credit card payment.
The advantage of using a lightning channel rather than zelle directly is that although zelle is much more difficult to reverse than a credit card, it is not completely irreversible, and there is no transaction standard (like the qr code invoices that lightning uses). In the event of a zelle reversal, escher rather than the merchant is responsible for collecting from the user, but since the user has to sign onto their TOS, the user will face much more severe penalties from reversing a zelle transaction than for initiating a credit card chargeback.
I also want to add that the cumulative effect of this is a net positive for those who don't use chargebacks (because merchants will be able to offer lower prices) and a net negative for those who do.

The entire point is that the onboarding process takes five minutes for most customers. The user can go from never having used bitcoin to making their first purchase at the checkout (if they have a zelle-enabled bank account).


The citibank account is owned by escher. This is the CEO's video, so he has access to that account. In general, the user would not.
