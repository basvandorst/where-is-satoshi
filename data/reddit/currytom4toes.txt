That 1000btc is just not one person, it could be a whole bunch of people.

I think the only person sold his cash at 8k is coinbase's boss.

How much did Gemini pay you for doing this, I will pay double.

You can become a lender and I am sure your interest can take care of your daily life. If not now, soon it will.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:42:57
I guess this means free money.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:55:21
Now, at price of $4425, I don't care if the price drop, just taking $700 at first day of the month every month.

I exchanged two Bit coins for some eths, that's all I could remember.
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:41:04
Good for you buddy!
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:33:24
Go to YouTube and check lending bitcoins online, I personally doing it on poloniex.com, but there's few other sites you can try, most of those exchange sites have lending option, if you think exchanging is not for you, you definitely should try lending.

I can pay my rent even if it drop 99%, I am trying to see how this will turn out, I just love Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:34:51
Simply poke your eyes with a fork, HARD!
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:42:39
I trade them on this website
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:27:02
You never know.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:40:16
No fear, I am already in.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:27:45
Oh no no no, I don't drink and I don't like "all time drunk and high" people around me, sorry man, nothing personal.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:55:04
I wish, but too bad I have to focus on daily life right now.
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:35:00
You should ask how long have you been hodl? Lot of them sold it when they see the price doubled, so will you.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:26:49
I know what I should do now, thanks man.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:28:10
I will give it a shot anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:20:05
I don't think so, there maybe a dip, but soon it will goes up to another ath.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:55:35
Sure thing, I might have a report every 3 months
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:43:15
I did nothing
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:29:29
Going back just a day is just too hard, I mean technically impossible for now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:25:26
We need an astronaut to do this.

What movie is this clip from? I have to watch the.whole movie no matter what.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:29:53
Man this guy is crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:05:43
Just a little update, as Nov 1, after three months, I took out $2100 (0.419BTC),  And still have 1.4649892BTC in my account, which is worth of $10345.64. So I spent $2100 out of $8400, and still have $10345 left, this is amazing so far.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:50:49
I need a link to this video,  or at least tell me did you eating raw or toasted.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:04:52
I found out most people here just see the knives and bandaids and quit watching the video, but I finished it, it was kinda gross but I like it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:10:04
Too much in an exchange, should separate them to a few exchanges instead of just one, that's what I do.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:13:27
I bought in at4500-4950, and that's about half of my savings, so what? Just face it, and hodl.

You will sell it at $7600 per BTC, and looking for a dip, then it never happens, and you start over again.
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:46:23
One hundred trillion dollars! Wtf!
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:59:51
Come on, it is only $200, go ahead and borrow money from you friend, out $200k in it man, have some ball please!
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:55:43
Oh yes, one most important thing: do not listen to all those "experts" out there, they are all bullshit, just follow your heart.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:18:43
Yes, when Eth was about 20, I bought all the way up to 130, and sold most of it at 240.
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:08:28
Life is a gamble, especially when you are in this  digital coins game. The safest way for a noob is to buy little by little, don't be a stupid and buy a whole bunch, little by little is what I think the best way to do.
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:27:29
I don't think they will have that much bit coins.
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:32:35
While you guys playing with bit coins, I sold hundreds  of eth when it hits 260 last week,  just trying to quit before I don't make any profit(my average buy was 200),  and luckily, it hits 138 on poloniex, guess what I did, I bought them back, all my money!
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:42:25
Wtf? Why there's a "-"sign in front of the numbers? Does it mean the price is negative?
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:35:49
There is a BTC in Poloniex, I think you lost that money.
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:19:37
People are very stupid, they buy everythings that start with "Bt", just go to poloniex and see what those stupid people have done.
