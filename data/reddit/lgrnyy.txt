Yep. I put my funds on a nanoledger and check just a few times a day.

Same here with Gemini. Went in on BTC and ETH only, swinging between 2-3x overall depending on the week. My friends are all discussing alts meanwhile the ETH they used to convert to everything else went up 3.5x. I put mine on the nano and don’t touch it.

I love both. Great for diversification.

This is not hyperbolic at all.

What? Brokers report gains, of which you need the cost basis to calculate.

Like any investment in life (save for some exceptions), yes.

That, and the govt would know if you bought a mutual fund because brokerage accounts require your SS and you receive a 1099 annually.

No it’s not. You sell something for more than what you bought it for and buy something else it triggers a taxable event. I wish this was taught in school instead of just for accounting/finance majors.

The answer to all of your questions/scenarios/examples is “yes your gains are taxed”.

While this may be true, I have zero sympathy for anybody who took out a student loan at any time this past decade to obtain a useless degree.

Yes. You’re taxed on the gain. If you held for under a year it counts as ordinary income and is taxed at your current rate (or higher if it gets you into the next tax bracket). If it’s more than a year then the gains are only taxed at 15%.
Edit: if you transfer it all to another currency then that amount is your new cost basis since you paying taxes on those gains when you sold makes this transaction kind of a “fresh start”.

Well this isn’t true. Gotta spend money to make money. You need 150 credits in America to be a CPA. That will require loans. These loans can be paid off very quickly after graduation with an entry level job in that field.

Only if you sold. If you’re still hodling then no because it could go back up.

Index funds are the way to go. Set it and forget it.

Your 1099 contains your realized capital gains and dividends. Your brokerage account contains everything which the government has because you provide your social security number when you sign up.

Need to start somewhere and it’s probably the most popular one.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:57:35
Gemini as well

Nobody in the world times these things correctly.
