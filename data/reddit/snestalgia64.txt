Honest question and I'm sorry it's not really Bitcoin related. But why is everyone saying they are going to sue the big Bitconnect people (cryptonick, trevon james, etc)? What could they possibly sue for? Do they have a case?

Remember everyone, bitcoin takes the stairs up and the elevator down. As the price of bitcoin gets higher, the size of the swings will get larger. This is fine.

@_date: 2017-12-11 15:19:49
I don't understand the people who are freaking out about the price when they have $100 invested. Like bitcoin seriously needs to be $34,000 for you to turn your $100 into $200. Get some real skin in the game before you flip out over every 5% dip

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:26:27
At this point, with only that much money I would invest it in a really cheap crypto like Bytecoin, TRON, Cardano, Ripple..etc. Much more of a chance to make some good profit. For you to double your $300, bitcoin would need to go to $35,000.

Coinbase charges a premium when buying bitcoin, they need to make money. That's the price you pay for using a basic interface.
Use GDAX which is owned by Coinbase if you want to buy at market price with no fees. Use limit orders.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:07:05

@_date: 2017-12-28 23:05:32
If anything that huge buy order is a good thing, keeps the price from going down
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:13:03
Hopefully bitcoin will go to $35k so you can make 20 bucks

Poll: [What do you think the price of BTC will be in 1 year?](
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:44:58
To follow up on this, the LTC just arrived in my GDAX account, took 4 days
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:59:51
It only works when LTC and BTC are playing against each other. When the prices are following each other it doesn't really work. I use the LTC/BTC exchange on GDAX and use limit orders. I wait until there is a lot of volume which causes really fast price movements. Say I set a buy LTC limit order at 0.01650 and purchase 20 LTC. Immediately after it fills, I pick a spot of where I think it will rise to and set my sell order, lets say at 0.0170. When there is a lot of volume, this could only take seconds. If it fills, I make a profit of 0.0005 BTC per LTC. So at 20 LTC, that's a total profit of 0.01 BTC (~$180). I like to do very quick trades like this, as I like to get my money back into BTC as quickly as possible.

You can send it to any address you like, just make sure you send it to an exchange that works in CA
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:41:21

Just hold your bitcoin and stop worrying about fluctuations. In 5 years when bitcoin is $1,000,000 you won't care 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:50:29
If you are scared, look at the 6H chart on GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:43:43
I do the same thing but with litecoin. Just make sure you're using limit orders. In the past two weeks, I've picked up about 0.03 free BTC
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:42:30
Still up on the day lmao. Chill 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:42:55
I saw your pic bro. On GDAX the price opened yesterday at $16,885.76 and closed at $17,730.12 (increase of $844.36) and it hit a high of $18,149.99 (increase of $1,264.23). So you can't really say the price has been boring. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:15:59
Sorry for the delay
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:43

@_date: 2017-12-20 17:27:06
It will, the people who coordinated it have probably already sold and their followers are the ones who are going to lose money

he just went sailing right out there
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:59:36
I feel like btc did better than a lot of the alt coins during that drop though... some of them got absolutely murdered
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:25:20

@_date: 2017-12-28 23:16:41
So people can see who it was before he deleted it
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:34:42
Maybe but I don't think that would effect the desire to own bitcoin. Which along with scarcity is what drives the price
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:28:06
No prob! Planned on recording it anyways, seemed like a good opportunity for my next video :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:31:29
yeah bad idea
edit: doubling up doesn't happen overnight btw...that's pretty rare. I'd look into a more obscure altcoin if I were you, something that hasn't broken out yet. You'll need to get lucky....
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:01:01
they would need a LOT more coins for that

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:18:19
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:45:34
I was scared of the price dropping today and losing a lot of my profit, but then I remembered that I don't plan on selling my coins for at least 2-3 years. So why do I care if it drops a few thousand if it will be $100k plus someday. I'm going to use this drop as an opportunity to increase my stack. In it for the long run
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:13:01
limit order bruh no fees, made a few hundred bucks
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:41:44

@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:59
wow that was cool to watch
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:01:29
They're not cashing out for a long time don't worry. Future is too bright to quit now
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:20:51
Yeah for sure. A sell wall is when there is a very large amount of bitcoin for sale at a certain price. In this video, there was over 1,000 bitcoin for sale at $17,250. The price cannot pass $17,250 until all 1,000 of those bitcoin are sold. On the right side of the screen are all of the incoming purchases, some of which were upwards of 200 bitcoin each (millions of dollars). This was the biggest sell wall I've ever seen
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:52:35
is the price only bouncing back up because the BCH exchange isnt working?

I think it’s just correcting to where it will stay for a while. It dipped down to 0.1 which was crazy. Just a bounce back 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:20:22

Not seeing this BCH spike
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:20:09
Yeah. I bought $300 more last week. By the time it hit my account it was worth $370
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:53:39
Then I will be a very rich dude
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:23
Hey, at least I didn't buy litecoin at 100

Edit: and never sell
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:53:36
Just blowback from the past 2 days which have been absolutely insane

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:06:17
That was some crazy volume
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:06:42
So $100 of BTC back then would now be worth $316 million...yeesh
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:05:30
You have to do a market order for that small of an amount
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:30:06
Haha, pretty funny not gonna lie

@_date: 2017-11-30 02:36:14
So I will have 1 of each?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:21:19
yeah because it dropped to 5500
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:39:38
Honestly this is a good thing. You don’t want 8 people texting you every time bitcoin drops $10
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:36:56
Ok so say BTC is $10000 and BCH is $1500, BTC will drop to $8500?
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:51:30
Good, 10 days where you can't fuck up trying to day trade

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:58:03
Nothing, because I'm sure you sold them long ago
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:08:02
Yep. I sold at $1600, bought back in later and lost half of my stack. Dumbass
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:52:18
Don't buy from these things, guarantee you it will be asking for like $11k per coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:43:40
Everyone panicking and I'm over here buying more
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:14:48

@_date: 2017-11-16 19:46:59
How much BTC do you think one would need to achieve this?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:50:35
Bought more at 9600
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:44:12
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:50:43
chill dawg
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:10:45
Don't worry, it broke 8k by $50+ which is huge. If it stopped at $7999 and never broke, that would have been bad
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:25:03
Just saw a $200 drop in literally 5 secs, that was insane
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:37:51

Had a dream last night that bitcoin had a flash crash to $10 and I was scrambling to get to my computer to buy a ton of them but by the time I got there it was back to 9k. I guess that was more of a nightmare and not a dream
