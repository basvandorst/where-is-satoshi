Some brighter news, my testimony as an expert witness for the first ever blockchain bill (AB 2658) introduced in the state of California passed! I made [a blog about it here](
In summary the gist of CA AB 2658 proposes to simply define blockchain technology in statute (not including smart contracts) to provide users and businesses greater certainty. It suggests blockchain technology to be defined as an electronic record under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). I assume this will be used when there is a legal issue between parties, taxes, labeling, identifying e.g., so then CA businesses and individuals can point to this bill in case of disputes.

I'm also building a decentralized way to host your web apps as an alternative to Amazon, Google, and Microsoft's cloud. If anyone is a developer in the space I would love for you to join me on [our subreddit]( I have a working testnet.

I'm using the important features inherent to a blockchain to facilitate the sale between those who need computing resources with those that have computing capacity to lease. This welcomes others to get involved in the cloud space and together we can provide more processing power and server space than any single entity could at a lower cost. This approach also flips data ownership back to the user.
Amazon still mostly runs at a loss [but their cloud computing is highly profitable]( Competition seems necessary.
I have been developing this with a team for years and we are still early. The subreddit is pretty new and would love to invite more to join. I will listen to everyone's impressions and ideas.

This is a good point. I will be sure to mentioned it in future conversation with members of legislation.

A few high level problems being solved are:
1. User's data is encrypted and owned rather than controlled by a centralized cloud oligarchy
2. Protects against government backdoor or request for API access
3. We lower waste of our planet's limited resources by enabling others to sell their unused server power / space
4. At scale, we would drastically lower cost of compute power and cost for reasons in 
5. It will be an open platform and ecosystem, rather than closed, that developers can build and offer their own tools and services on
I went ahead and pinned it too but I go into further detail [here](
