It is beyond me why we are discussing about Starbucks when there is non in my city. This does not have any news value in it. init?

Torrent has a tracker as well, so not exclusively Peer to Peer in a superstrict manner. I understand what you getting at. I think it always have been like that or at least since I joined the community for the first time in 2010. I'm more concerned about the other word from that sentence.

Something is wrong with your keyboard, words are missing from your sentences. Or what you say just does not make sense?

I’m just trying to get the logic in detail but it seams everyone is angry here and there is not much reasoning.

A true HODLer does not want to cash out. HODL-ing until one can start using it without an exchange or middleman.

Are you getting your information from Russian State Television? Why don't you use Cartoon Network instead so you can save yourself from getting grey too early?

I see, thanks for clarification, I am a fan of Irish people :) 
Why is it not Peer to Peer? Is torrent Peer-To-Peer?

Are these guys work for a company called bcash?
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:20:10
What do you mean "bcash is buying up bitcoin companys"? Money cannot buy, people buy. Who do you have in mind?
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:23:37
I don't know any HODL-er who does not have a job.

Noone cares about weekly stats when people are using payment solutions in peaking manner. Do you think new years eve, Valentines day or 24th of December, Black Friday/Cyber Monday are weekly events? Some of them is but most people do things in the same time in the same timezone. If you are not ready serving the peaks, your product is not ready for mass adoption.

How can you say there is no other version of an opensource project? You are either crazy or deliberately lying to people. Linux is Opensource for example and there are many distributions.

Bitcoin was designed to take away the power from rich people and welcome everyone even if they earn cents in a week. You are just doing the opposite = acting like central banks.
Do you also want to charge poor people for checking their balances?!

Did you know that soft wallets are soft nodes as well? They keep the recent blocks so they can verify the TXes you receive.

I love this comment!

haha if I were you I would upvote this comment
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:45:55
I was referring to the fee, let's see another one: 556769 . The fee doesn't have to grow if the tx pool is bigger or the block gets bigger because it wraps all the recent transactions. The fee is growing artificially if you are trying to compete with other TXs and you replace your transaction with higher fee. It's an upwards spiral, a race.  If the pool is constantly at a number of unprocessed transactions you are forcefully expluding people from the system who want to pay eachother but let's say they are only transacting a few dollar cents so they can buy a bag of rice, corn or fire wood. This makes me feel sad.

Thanks for putting back my comment. Why is my flair sais I'm "redditor for 3 months"?

Check Block 556758 on the bcash chain.

hahahahaha and another ha
jajajajajjaja - also in Spanish
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:23:02
You are missing the point :) The sats are set by software presets but you can set it yourself as well usually. If you are doing small amount, you can set the fee to 1sat or even 0 if you are really broke and your transaction will still be there in the next block. Even if it doesn't fit to the next block you can expect it to be processed since you cannot send the same TX with higher fee therefore cancel your initial transaction. That is my problem with RBF.
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:21:24


With instant transaction times, low fee, and superior merchant support.
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:09:37
Do we still have the same amount of transactions as we did in December?

Can you paste here the “not good” part? Does it have a syntax error?

Well you are talking but not really saying anything. Can you specify please? I’m listening.

The most downvoted comments are usually gold here. And there it is.
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:27:35
Can you please elaborate? If you read through the threads from last 2 years you can find that the comment is actually true.
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:25:10
Based on what?
@_date: 2018-12-04 12:37:02
Well this is not WOW childchat so your tiny argument doesn’t worth a penny. It seems someone got rekt and is not able to understand reason.
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:33:52
No you did’t you are just trying to lower me to a level of no referencing. The ball is still with you.
@_date: 2018-12-04 12:35:05
I’m not referring to anything, I’m trying to figure out what you are referring to. There are plenty of tech around what could be discussed it seems you cannot even tell an example.
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:31:47


Yes it was hacked. Just show me the gold reserv backing it. Yep, it is nowhere...
