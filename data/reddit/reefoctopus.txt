In reality we still don't know what will happen once there is liquidity. There is quite a bit of uncertainty, and that is the likely reason dollar value and hashpower are discordant.

The opposite of what? Link? 
You're going to get drastically different opinions depending on which side they support. It's like a holy war.

I don't see any way around it. Electricity costs aren't cheap for everyone either, and that drastically limits where miners can be located. I'd run at a loss where I live on both electricity and bandwidth. 
Centralization / decentralization exist on a continuum. Many places on that continuum are acceptable. The question is how much centralization is too much. I don't know the answer, but certainly protecting against bad actors and governments is important.

No. I don't. I would run at a loss.

They can sell. The price is determined by transactions on the exchanges, and each transaction requires a buyer and a seller. The problem is that the infrastructure for moving bitcoin cash to exchanges is reportedly not working or nonexistent at the moment. This means that at some exchanges the only supply is coming from people who had BTC on the exchanges during the fork. 
Imagine it's 4 in the morning, there are 3 pieces of pizza left, the pizza place is closed, and 10 drunk people want a piece of pizza. During the day a slice of pizza is $1. In this case a bidding war erupts, and maybe the 3 pieces of pizza go for $5 each.

You're thinking of ethereum.

1mb was completely arbitrary to begin with. How can you take a hardline stance that 2mb is the end of the world? Is 1.1 mb the end of the world? What about 1.05? 1.00001? 
I've seen tons of rah rah cheerleading, but I've yet to see anyone make a convincing argument that the block size shouldn't be increased to 2mb. When you can fix a whole bunch of issues by increasing a single variable - that's what you do! Seriously, please explain it to me or point me towards anyone that has made a cogent argument against it.

There are many people who agree with the principles behind BCH who are neither shills nor paid by Roger. Responding to all criticism with ad hominems does nothing to further your cause.

Thank you for backing your argument up with empirical evidence. 
People often refer to centralization and decentralization, but there seem to be different types. For example, there is centralization of hashpower, but there's also the problem of geographic centralization. With the 20k nodes bitcoin cash hopes for, it is clear that geographic decentralization would suffer immensely.  
You may be right that a decentralized currency cannot stand the test of time in the same way that governments have been known to fail. Perhaps the explosion in alt coins is an evolutionary test in currency governance, and we'll arrive at a solution.  
Typically when it comes to politics the status quo doesn't give up power willingly. Economists often remark that they'd prefer a benevolent monarch to any form of representative government.

You make good points, and I'll likely watch some Adam back talks and read some papers tonight. Could you point me towards resources you think might be beneficial?
My concern is that we have this brilliant idea which has the potential to change the world for the better.  It wrestles power away from central banks, away from political regimes which use them to redistribute wealth towards those who already have it. It's probably the most important discovery/breakthrough of the century.
Investors often pervert good ideas in order to profit. Here's an example: 
There was news today that Reddit will be completely redesigning their homepage, they are adding features, tweaking things, and my spacing out the profile pages. I've been using Reddit for nearly a decade (this isn't my first account), and I'm of the opinion that it already does exactly what it needs to do. The change isn't meant to make the site better for users. It is meant to increase ad revenue, and it perverts what made Reddit great in the first place. Why would they do this? There is pressure from investors.
All of the descriptions I've seen as to what Blockstream/Core has planned for the future look like banking infrastructure plastered on top of bitcoin. I don't understand why this is necessary, and I'm afraid it'll end up captured by an industry at odds with the good bitcoin might bring to the world. 
Why do we need this settlement layer? It sounds like they want to bring in big banks / MNCs to handle what bitcoin already does well.  What would be wrong with people holding bitcoin and transferring it to fiat as they need it, or only using it for larger purchases? There are already debit cards which work like that, and they use the existing infrastructure. 
Core has fought tooth and nail against increasing the blocksize when it's clearly a valid solution at least for the time being. Maybe this is just kicking the can down the road, but there is probably a long road before it's untenable. I imagine hard drives will continue to increase in size at a similar rate in at least the near future. 
Blockstream has raised money, and there needs to be some return for their investors. How can you say that this hasn't affected their stance on the scaling debate? I've raised money before, and I certainly felt pressure to make my investors a return. Regardless of the cypher punk street cred Adam back has, his stance on these issues is very likely affected by this.
Those are my concerns. I unfortunately sat on the sidelines watching bitcoin grow for years, and only recently did I start paying attention to the politics of it. I am still trying to piece it all together. Why aren't these concerns valid?

If bitcoin dies there are five altcoins to take its place. This is a ridiculous argument. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:38:31
Bitcoin and bitcoin cash are two different coins. Bitcoin cash is a fork or bitcoin so everybody that owned bitcoin also now owns the same amount of bitcoin cash. Many have claimed they'll sell bitcoin cash as soon as they have the chance. It's almost a religious war at this point. 
There is no pent up supply of BTC that will now hit the market. Supply and liquidity of BTC has not changed.
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:24:46
Ah. I can see that. I was responding to a couple of different threads. I forgot where this one started. My point was meant as anecdata to highlight that not everyone in relevant fields agrees.
I realize that the core devs may be doing the correct thing. I'm still trying to figure out what that is, and it's tough for me to ignore the conflict of interest. With the number of early bitcoin millionaires I'm surprised core isn't funded by a nonprofit - seriously, the kochs fund pretty much anything they can related to Austrian economics.
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:49:14
I understand the factions at play, but I hadn't seen that breakdown. I only recently started paying attention to bitcoin again. I never claimed to be an authority, but I do certainly have some relevant knowledge.
I'm here asking questions and bringing up issues I think might be important because I'm trying to cut through a metric fuckton of bullshit to find some semblance of objective truth. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:00:55

It's a recurring theme on this subreddit. I'm not sticking up for anyone. I'm trying to convey to you that it's doing the opposite of what you hope, and it's turning this subreddit into an echo chamber devoid of real debate.

Each block contains a bunch of transactions. If there are no blocks then nobody can move Bitcoin Cash on or off exchanges. He's suggesting that the price is plunging as people are able to move bitcoin cash to exchanges because everyone is selling. This is probably true. I imagine we'll see a crash and then a recovery once there is liquidity in the market.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:34:58

I don't think it's a conspiracy theory to point out that investors have an effect on the direction of firms in which they invest. You're probably right that that particular account isn't here to discuss the matter with good faith intentions. That said, the impression that I get browsing this sub is that there are certain questions that aren't welcome at all - questions which are met with abuse rather than an honest explanation.

Fees aren't going down, and doesn't it shrink the non segwit part of the block?

You probably wouldn't have kept them. I got to the confirmation page to buy 100 @ $12, but between then and now there were times when I definitely would have cashed out.

There isn't an upper limit in terms of fiat because central banks create it out of thin air.

You can't guarantee that the price will not be in the range of $1000.

I doubt this prediction took into account what will happen if it splits. That looks to be the route we're taking.

It might. Take a look at some of the historical price graphs on a logarithmic scale. We could see $2000 bitcoin again this year.

People arguing against miners are the same sorts of people who think you can eliminate drugs with prohibition. You know what will happen if you change proof of work? Someone with capital will still probably rise to control a significant portion of hash power.

That must be why the price ratchets up at each new block. /s 
It is clearly not priced in. I wouldn't be surprised to see a new ATH today as people who sold FOMO their way back in.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:00:22
You're right unless something about segwit fundamentally alters the nature of bitcoin such that it is no longer bitcoin by definition. If segwit goes through, and there isn't a split then I'll likely sell/move to an Altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:07:54
What sort of research? How low do you expect it to go? What are you basing this on?
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:07:16
The market hasn't decided anything yet. I don't know what will happen, but I bet it'll be interesting. 
I doubt we'll see that many coins hit the market. Most people learned from the ethereum split that they should probably keep both until the dust settles. If a bunch of people all dump the new coin I imagine it would be a great time to buy.

@_date: 2017-07-30 04:39:09
He probably means cheap for the miners. The money that goes to the miners goes towards securing the network via hashpower. You would be moving transactions off chain. Of course this is the point of view of a miner. Core/blockstream is moving transactions off chain so they have control over them - so profits go to the layer 2 infrastructure that's planned. That's the central issue isn't it? This is a power struggle between the miners and the developers. Both groups have investors. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:26:51
People are selling because of uncertainty. It's likely we'll end up with two coins.
