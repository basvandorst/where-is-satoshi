Seriously.  I'd love a movie of his life as an economic hitman.  He's done a few interviews that are used in a couple documentaries.  I think Zeitgeist is one.

John (I think) Perkins has a bit of good information on how banks/financial orgs and unreasonable loans are used as "soft" weapons in Confessions of An Economic Hitman. I'd recommend checking it out.

It's just about 100% traceable (excluding coin mixers). Super easy to track transactions to/from wallets. Just can be difficult to match wallets to people/institutions.

I've never bought anything with BTC. I view that as a long term store of wealth. Def bought some noots with LTC though.

I love the app guys.  Simple to use, clean interface, and the concept is great.  Any idea when/if Navy Federal CU will be supported in the future?  Thanks.
