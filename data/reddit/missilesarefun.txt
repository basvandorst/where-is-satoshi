You cant say that either, you are making an assumption that is based in your beliefs i.e. "his conclusions dont align with mine therefor he did no research and is a dumbass". This is even worse than being intellectually lazy. Try to think about the situation a little more.

No no no, look at your reply again. In your eyes one screenshot enough to make him famous.
Shall i remind you why he is famous? 
Well for his software and antics, antics that got him covered by mainstream media. Thats why he is famous, not because people take screenshots of his tweets, they take screenshots BECAUSE he is famous. Get with the program sport.

This is not a shitpost, after carefull analysis and speaking to my professors, I have come to this conclusion, I can go into detail in another post.

There wont be a bull run tho.
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:46:24
How can I be biased against BTC if I own BTC? The same goes for the other crypto. I'm not favoring any other crypto so what exactly am I being biased about? THINK BEFORE TYPING!!!
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:28:40


What other side? The thesis of my post was an argument explaining my thoughts on why bitcoin is not going to recover. If by the other side you mean I Should have included an optimistic point? Yeah sorry sport, but you should look into the definition of "biased".


You can't explain your position so you resort to call what I am doing trolling, fail.
Now if I was a staunch supporter of Etherium and constantly praised it while bashing Bitcoin and ignored data supporting Bitcoin and I only posting things that reaffirmed my support for Etherium, then you can call me "biased" against Bitcoin.
You have to learn to take L's bud.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:19:11
Not saying its false, never implied it, so get your shit together noob
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:38:39

You need to be able to accept when you are wrong bud.


What exactly about what I wrote makes it "biased"?

Its to be expected from the bitcoin community, alot of people are here because they go against the mainstream, which zerotrash pretends to be. The ONLY objective meduim is one you piece together through rigorous research consucted under a moderate centrist view. Otherwise you will let your biases and preconceived notions cloud your judgment, which is exactly what both sides of any given spectrum do.
Oh and research does not mean reading articles you found on zero hedge. 
Remember, avoid that confirmation bias.

@_date: 2018-11-18 15:17:07


You NEVER gave a reason as to why I'm being "biased"


If you cannot make a proper rebuttal, keep your rhetoric to yourself. So please "stay away" from making any more comments.
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:56:16


I'm not bashing Bitcoin, what part of "won't go up any time soon" alludes to me bashing bitcoin? I'm not attacking bitcoin, im not saying it's going to fail, im I'm saying it won't go up "any time soon". Now you have two words to look up the meaning of "biased" and now "bashing". 
I get the sense that in your world, any opinions on bitcoin that are not positive are biased.


"Fact is" that the contents of my post are the conclusions I reached after looking at the data. And again, nothing about my post is "biased".

Ill ask you again, what stance am I taking on bitcoin? For or against? Optimist or pessimist? Bearish or bullish? Because "CLEARLY" you deduced that by the title of my post.

So what, thats not my point but yes he believes in bitcoin more than me and im 100% fine with that, so no dice there moon boy.


Yes because i "literally" sit at the computer all day looking for pitential screenshots. Yup because after one screenshot that is bitcoin related I "literally" have nothing else to so XD


Oh yeah because a widespread implimentation of bitcoin depends on the small percentage of people in it for the tech. No dumbass the public at large has to accept bitcoin and belive its a better alternative to fiat. Anyways, this section was a garbled mess of reaponse. Work on your writting skills sport.


Wtf? After getting this far I now know you are talking out of your ass in a emotionally charges typing tyrade. See ya moon boy, ill be laughing the whole way as bitcoin is manipulated into oblivion because idiots like you dont want to accept reality... bitcoin is just a way to make more fiat.

Yeah b******* I have seen plenty of post of people predicting Bitcoin will rise that get up votes with nothing to support them, but as soon as someone makes a post that does not make you feel good, "oh have to downvote". I have my reasons, I looked at the state of affairs and spoke to several economists at school, there will be no bullrun.

So people are buying bitcoin because they have faith in it and want to purchase good with said bitcoin? To get rich with bitcoin is to buy at a low price and sell at a high price, only way to buy essential with gains made from your investment is to convert it to fiat. I seriously doubt most people are buying bitcoin because they are supportive of a change in currently accepted fiat standards.

You can increase or decrease the money supply to accomidate for changes in the market and you also have physical currency in circulation.
Bitcoin only has a finite amout which will run into the same problems seen with the gold standard.
Also having it be 100% digital leaves it volnurable to cyber attack. Its a neat idea on paper and would work is the countries of the world worked together but that is not going to happen.

Really? RT? Thats your source? A russian propaganda outlet known for pushing half-truths, conspiracy theories, and demonizing the west?
Back in 2013 they ran several stories where they insinuated that the New York Federal Reserve Bank was missing Germanies gold, they spread this dogshit conspiracy for weeks until the NY fed started shipping Germanies gold back to them. Conspiracy debunked right? Ohhh no not for RT, these clowns then spread rumors that the gold being sent to Germany was not the original gold, but were other bars in the same shape with the same stamps and serial numbers. Such an obvious scam by the US that Germany complained... oh wait they said nothing.

I was just like you once, i bough silver, railed against fiat yadi yadi yada...but after a more centrist approach I learned too look at both sides of the issue and bring X &amp; Y together to form a more complete picture instead of, "Fiat bad!! Good and Silver good".
Of course is you had sound money there would be less debt because you cannot loan out money which you do not have in reserve, but that would stifle growth and bring the economy to a screeching halt if we reverted to the gold standard. The last 50 years has seen the fastest growth in human history, and has literally created more value in development, products, advancements etc... than all th gold and silver put together. There is no reward without risk, and fiat unfortunately does bring risk and has its own problems, but it's not the boogeyman like so may in these circles make it out to be.
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:08:51

Dude stop making assumptions!! Fuck you are assuming I am a bitcoin optimist, im not!!! The title of my post is neutral, it can be used on either side of the argument. If I was an optimist on bitcoin I would have included more detail on said optimism. If I was pessimistic on bitcoin I could use my post and argue that because Mcafee saying these things, it might discourage bitcoin adoption by the public at large if they think bitcoin is just another trade to make money on.
YESHHHHHH!!!! A little critical thinking wouldnt hurt there bud.
@_date: 2018-11-11 12:24:09
Fiat allowed for exponential growth, money was no longer tied up to a supply of gold or silver. And if you really think about it, that "paper" is backed by the goods that are produced, the value that comes out of production backs fiat. Of course if there is a better way of managing financial transactions im in all for it but crypto is too young an unpredictable to be making claims such as, "it will replace fiat". Just because it's crypto does not mean it won't be affected by market forces. Gold and silver itself is intrinsically worthless just as much as fiat is. If there is nothing to buy, they are all worthless. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:20:28
There is a reason behind it I did not just post it for no reason I already looked at a lot of numbers a lot of charts and also spoke to my professors at school. The markets are not going to recover anytime soon anywhere near the levels they were before. One reason is the strength of the dollar as long as the world's biggest economy keeps growing investors will have confidence in it leading to less interest in Bitcoin. The technology Bitcoin is based on will be adapted that I am sure of but Bitcoin itself it's not going to recover anytime soon

Sourcing from zerohedge is a red flag that the person behind the link might not be the most objective type of person. 
Besides thats a moot point, you are trying to say that because Reuters reported that same story it somehow legitimizes zerohedge? Sorry but that does not work.
