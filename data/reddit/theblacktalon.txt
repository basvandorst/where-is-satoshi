This is pretty sweet. Thanks for this!
**Edit:** It would be nice if we could also see the prices in our local currency. For example I live in Canada and prefer to see the prices in CAD.

Avoid Coinbase like the plaige. Not only do you get screwed with insane network fees but also they keep disabling trading/buying/selling almost daily now limiting your ability to make money. Gdax does the same minus the insane network fees but I'd say dump them and switch to a much better and more stable exchange site.

Send it through Gdax because Coinbase charges around $40 for sending BTC. My BTC transaction from 2 days ago took about 3 hours to complete but it could be different now.

Im a newbie and support this 100%. I come here for news, constructive discussions, and learn from the vets but all I see are cringy memes and fanboyish threads mainly bashing other cryptos for no reason which unfortunately get upvoted while the more serious questions from newbies who want to learn gets downvoted. This is the official sub of Bitcoin and we should treat it in a more serious manner or else the non-sense will drive more newbies away to other subs or forums. This will probably get downvoted too but its the truth regarding the image of this sub from a newbie's POV.

Its very accurate. This is me as a day trader selling high and hoping the value drops so I can rebuy again. Its very stressful but its been working pretty ok for me so far.
