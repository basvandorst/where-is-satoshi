You are right, but a greater % of newcomers will stick around if we all make a small effort to be a little more welcoming, show them the ropes and allay their fears. 
Getting into crypto is scary enough.

Well I must admit I’m struggling to comprehend your point, though I can’t be sure if that’s because of your apparent inability to articulate yourself beyond playground rhetoric or my own ability to read. Given the medium by which we are communicating I’m inclined to assume the former. 
I edited my previous reply to you for what it’s worth.

Right but I’ve been trying to verify my ID on Coinbase for 3 weeks now and they tell me to try again in 30 minutes every time.

Just hostility in general then?
I do hope you realise my comment was before the original commenters “edit”, in a comment thread that is also talking about “normie purges”. 
This comment and others in the thread are hostile towards newcomers, which is what my comment was getting at. 
If there is a point I have missed, please help me identify it.

Articles like this just make bit coin look sketchy to the layperson and are ultimately harmful to the (bitcoin) economy.

Don’t think I missed anything at all. 
Edit: to clarify, my original comment is from before the original commenter added his “edit”. Since your reading proficiency is better than mine I’m sure you noticed that. 
Even post-edit however, his comment is hostile towards newcomers and he appears more interested in observing and commenting on the misgivings of newcomers than educating and assisting. This is not behaviour that will develop bitcoin for the better.

Oh you do? That would be really interesting research to look at if you have it available?
Technology is nothing without people to adopt it. 100k won’t come if more people don’t adopt it. Stop being elitist and help people get on board and we will all benefit.

So the post office can either send your email and take an admin fee, or let you figure out another way to send the email and get nothing.

It’s depressing that the new technology you (I’m assuming) have a vested interest in is gaining popularity?
Sure, super depressing.

Do you understand how market values work? Why do you want to “purge” the new found interest in the commodity you have invested in?
Think about what you are saying.

Without giving it a great deal of thought, a gov crypto currency seems to me to be a great idea for spending public funds (including expenses of gov officials). Given the public nature of the ledger this would provide a high level of transparency to tax payers. 
Also, is it not only fiat if the value is determined by government regulation? Could a government not still create a crypto currency without linking its value to the economic output of its country? (Genuine question)
