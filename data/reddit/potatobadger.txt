\ - Get involved! Don't feel like you're expected to invest large portions of money in Bitcoin. Find a local Bitcoin meetup and attend one to get some of your questions answered and meet new friends. Get a few dollars worth to experiment with, and purchase something small. These treats from the Bees Brothers are delicious! 
\ - You didn't ask for  but I'm giving it anyways. Watch out for scams! Many of us are accustomed to the institution-backed financial system, where you can usually reverse fraudulent transactions. Bitcoin transactions are generally irreversible, and this makes it a prime target for scammers. There are more legitimate businesses than scammers, but you need to be careful out there! If something sounds to good to be true...

Lol. Faucets probably aren't really worth your time, man. Check out @_date: 2015-06-29 02:15:13
I am as optimistic as ever! Some exchanges will continue to fail, and better ones will replace them. Wallets will become more user-friendly. The block chain will become the TCP/IP of financial applications, the backbone of land titles, stocks and bonds, decentralized marketplaces (Open Bazaar?), etc. I'm probably in the minority on this one, but I actually think that as Bitcoin matures and its "antifragility" continues, it will eventually (20 years? 50 years?) become one of the most stable stores of value we've ever seen. Imagine a currency that is even more widely accepted than the current USD, is used in the vast majority of financial contracts, has a predetermined and unchangeable supply, and has no central point of failure or trust.
I'm really excited.

Multisignature wallet services like greenaddress.it which allow for instant confirmation of payments exist. What I would like to see is:
A) A standard protocol to allow many of these services to work interchangeably and make it easy for merchants to choose which ones they trust and for how much at a time.
B) User and merchant adoption of this protocol.
C) An escrow feature (in addition to the instant confirmations feature) which allows dispute resolution and charge backs.

Bitcoin works like most open source projects. There is a set of core developers which must accept any suggested modifications to the source code. These core developers have invested a large amount of time to earn the respect of Bitcoin users.
In the event that these core maintainers did implement "bad code", users are not forced to update. Many developers are watching changes to the source code, and would sound the alarms if anything fishy was happening.
The project can always be forked as well, by a new set of developers that want to make their own version. There are more than 1 full node implementation already, and I expect more will come.
In the end, it's up to each user to decide what code they would like to run.

You take an ordered set of data, such as a list of transactions in a block. Replace each of these pieces with its own hash. Now combine these pieces in pairs to form a new set with half as many datum. Hash, rinse, and repeat until you only have one hash left. Now you have your Merkel root from the Merkel tree :) Google for examples, pictures, and a more detailed description.

In 5 years, I would guess we'll continue to see a *lot* of growth. Much more adoption by users and businesses alike. Some of the earlier "on-top-of-Bitcoin" applications such as colored coins and Open Bazaar will probably be getting some real traction. I don't think 5 years is enough to get us to the endgame where BTC has reached the position of the world's reserve currency, but maybe 15 or 20 years will be.

There are great arguments on both sides of this debate, and enormous amounts of potential success or failure are on the line. These, among many other factors, make it extremely difficult to reach consensus on the issue.


These core developers represent the views of many Bitcoin users, including miners, exchanges, pool operators, and everyday users. Anyone is allowed in this debate, and anyone is allowed to ignore it. Nobody is forced to upgrade their clients to a new block size limit. Nobody is prevented from upgrading their clients.
There certainly is some level of centralization in having so much influence in the hands of several developers. I hope we continue to see a growing number of alternative full node implementations developed by a variety of communities.

There are great arguments on both sides of the block size debate. At this point, I am still undecided. I try to set a high bar for myself before I draw conclusions. If it were up to me, I would leave the limit for now and begin some serious research before deciding to promote a change.
@_date: 2015-06-29 06:04:33
That will be quite challenging ;)
You will want to start out looking into OP_RETURN and how to use it to encode data in a transaction in chunks. See here for example messages:

It's a hash algorithm. You put any amount of data in one end, and get a seemingly-random 256-bit string of data out the other end. Every time you put in the same data, you get the same 256 bits back. There is no way to reconstruct the original data from the 256 bit hash. There is no way to predict what the hash will be. A tiny change of the input data will result in a complete change in the hash.

I think I'm going to have to go with my first Bitcoin paycheck, though. I was sitting in the lounge on the top floor of a dorm building at my school with a beautiful view of the city. Hearing that coin-rolling notification sound, seeing the transaction on my phone with +X BTC, and *knowing* that somebody on a different continent just sent me an entire paycheck instantly with no trusted intermediaries and a fee of maybe $0.02. Knowing that the money was minutes away from being truly, irreversibly mine. There was a huge grin on my face, and the rest of the world felt like an anachronism. It was seriously awesome.

Definitely yes for something like that, where you have a system where others want to verify the "authenticity" of your item. I can sort of see it applying to art, but it in no way stops somebody from just duplicating the image file and sharing that. It doesn't really stop anyone from having their own free copy of the art to enjoy, but it gives a limit to how many copies allow the owner to say "haha, I have the artist's blessing!"

Satoshi set a 1 MB block size limit early on to prevent unruly miners from creating massive blocks full of spam.

Yes, coins will be lost (well, they're still there, just not accessible - sort of like blasting gold into space) over time. However, as wallet software and backup methods improve, and as the value of coins increases (assuming it will), I think fewer coins will be lost.
If you're wondering if we could come close to "running out" of coins, no. As I mentioned, people will be more careful in time and I doubt even half will be lost within the first few decades. Additionally, we can update the protocol to allow further division of coins. Even 1 BTC would theoretically be enough to facilitate global commerce if we keep increasing divisibility.
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:28:49
No, I don't really follow the idea that we'll reach a jobless society. Going back a few thousand years and introducing farming to hunter-gatherers, you might wonder what the other 95% of people will do with their time. Well, they moved to cities and find new useful things to do with their lives.
We live in a world of scarce resources and unlimited demand. Our jobs will become easier and our quality of life will improve. Maybe someday a 4-hour work week will be plenty to support an average lifestyle. Heck, maybe the amount of work required to life an average lifestyle will become so small that charitable organizations can afford to completely eradicate our current understanding of poverty. But I'm sure people will always want more, and it will be their choice to work in order to get it.

You can take a 5 MB image and hash it to produce a 256 bit hash. If you put those 256 bits in the block chain, you can prove that the image existed at the time that block was mined if you can also produce the image itself (which would be able to result in the identical hash).
What the block chain could be useful for is timestamping files with a proof of existence. As for just sharing the file itself, things like BitTorrent are much more efficient. Data on the block chain is expensive. People are also working on protocols similar to BitTorrent which allow you to pay for others to store your files in a sort of peer-to-peer cloud. Check out projects like MaidSafe.
Edit: That wasn't very ELI5, but hopefully close enough.

I think wallets should abstract away the concept of keys entirely, and allow the user to back up their entire (HD) wallet in various familiar formats. Printed QR code, a mnemonic phrase to write down, a simple wallet file. I also think multisignature implementations for muli-factor authentication should be improved to flawlessly increase wallet security.
In the meantime, my recommendation depends on how much the user wanted to save and just how unfamiliar with computers they are. I'd generally recommend existing multisignature services such as green address.it, and using existing backup features such as the 12 word mnemonic phrases. For someone storing very large amounts, I would recommend getting a little bit educated on the issue and investing in dedicated offline hardware for generating and storing cold wallets.

1. A bitcoin address contains 3 pieces of information. At the beginning is a version number, and this is what always leaves you a 1 at the beginning for Version 1 (pay to public key hash / P2PKH) addresses. The new version of addresses are for (pay to script hash / P2SH) and start with a 3. In the middle is the main part, a hash of your public key (or script). This is the part actually used in a transaction that pays to the address. At the end is a short hash of the previous data. It is used as a checksum to validate an address was typed/copied correctly. If you mistype one character in the address, your wallet will know because the checksum won't match.
2. I don't like to give investment advice. You should really step back and see what your financial goals are and how to give yourself the best chance of accomplishing them. Everyone is different.
3. I just want to caution you about lending itself. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and that is dangerous when lending to strangers. It can definitely work out, just be careful. Take things slow. Make sure you know what you're getting into.

Those are also hidden until the outputs are redeemed.
When you pay to a regular '1----' address, the output on your transaction is actually a simple script that can be redeemed by anyone with the private key to a public key whose hash is contained in that address. An address contains the public key hash, as well as the version number and a check sum. These are called P2PKH (pay-to-public-key-hash). The public key itself is not revealed until the recipient claims that output in a new transaction, where they both reveal the public key (which **must** hash to the same value as in the output) and a signature for the new transaction using the corresponding private key.
When you pay to the '3-----' addresses, it's similar but the script is a bit different. Rather than saying "pay to public key hash", you actually say "pay to script hash". That script could be lots of things. Usually, it's a multisignature script which requires m-of-n signatures. It could be any kind of Bitcoin script, though. This script is not revealed until the output is redeemed. The revealed script must hash to the hash in the original output, and it usually requires some accompanying data such as m signatures.

We actually used to just send to public keys with Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) outputs. There are a few reasons we switched to Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH). Probably the most important reason is that using the hash adds a sort of "buffer" of security.
Implementations of public key cryptography tend to lose their security over time, as small weaknesses are found that make it incrementally easier to do things like derive a private key from a given public key. Hash algorithms tend to be much stronger.
When you use P2PK, the public key is public knowledge. If you use P2PKH, only the hash is known before the output gets redeemed later on. This is actually one of the reasons you should never reuse addresses. When you redeem an output sent to an address, the public key gets revealed in the transaction. Any future transactions send to this address are a bit less secure.
There's now a new standard transaction type called Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH). It lets you send coins to an output redeemed by a non-disclosed script with the corresponding hash. It works similarly to P2PKH, but rather than using the hash of a public key, you can use the hash of an entire (possibly complicated) script. Usually, the script is a simple multisignature script requiring m signatures from n keys.

That's exactly correct! It's definitely a privacy issue, but it can become a security issue as well. In addition to revealing the public key, you also give out a signature from the private key with each new transaction. While this shouldn't be a problem with problem cryptographic implementations, it can be problematic in rare cases. There was once a RNG bug in Android that resulted in stolen bitcoins. The RNG bug alone wouldn't have been enough to steal the coins, but Android wallets were reusing addresses, and this caused a problem.

I never stored my Bitcoins on Mt. Gox, but my previous BTC paychecks are now worth 40% less because of Mt. Gox failing. Mt.

Full nodes propagate transactions. When you create a transaction, it is just a piece of information signed by you that says "I am sending X number of coins to address A" which gets passed around the network.
Miners then confirm these transactions by placing them inside blocks (groups of confirmed transactions) on the block chain. Each new block is placed on top of a previous block, giving an extra confirmation to all transactions before it.

I live in the US. My employer in Europe pays me through the Bitcoin network. We don't have to share banking information. Our money doesn't pass through the hands of multiple banks, picking up fees and exchange rates along the way.
The fee for each international Bitcoin "paycheck" is about **$0.05**.
I can then take those coins and buy things I need online without having to enter a credit card number and worry about identity theft. Merchants like NewEgg also regularly give big discounts to Bitcoin users to reward us for using a payment system that has low fees for them. Businesses don't like the multiple-percent fees either, especially when their profit margin is only in the vicinity of 5%.

I think the others gave most of the advice you can get as for recovering these 30 BTC, but I have some advice for future use.
I'm in a similar situation regularly. I keep only small amounts for spending (like you would keep in a regular wallet) on my mobile wallet. If you don't already, I would suggest making some paper wallets for cold storage and putting them in a safe place. What you can then do is save one of their addresses (not the private key) in your mobile wallet. Whenever you get paid or have excess money for any reason in your mobile wallet, you can just forward the funds into cold storage without having to actually make new cold storage wallets or take any out.

If you know the public key, you can send to the public key. This was actually the first standard transaction type (pay-to-public-key / P2PK). Then came the 1--- addresses which contain a hash of the public key, and transactions are pay-to-public-key-hash / P2PKH. To redeem those outputs, you must provide the public key (whose hash must be the same as in the output) and a signature from the corresponding private key.
Now we're getting fancier with the 3--- addresses. Those addresses contain an entire script hash (pay-to-script-hash / P2SH) rather than a public key hash. The script could be anything from the Bitcoin scripting language. Usually, it's a multisignature script requiring signatures by multiple public keys. When redeeming these outputs, you provide the original script as well as any other data required by that script.
Also, addresses are more than RIPEMD160(SHA256(Key)). They begin with a version number and end with a hash used as a checksum (to avoid sending to a typo). They're also converted to base 58, which is most alphanumeric characters, excluding a few visually similar ones.

Pools decrease payout variance. It makes mining less of a gamble. Without pools, you could invest $20,000 in mining equipment and not even have that great of a chance of finding a single block.
Which would end up bankrupting most of the casual miners. And you would have even less people mining.
Pools aren't *that* bad for being "democratic" because it is easy to just switch pools if your pool operator is acting maliciously. The only problem is that in the mining pool protocols we have been using, it isn't possible to know whether the pool operator is being malicious until some time into the attack.
With things like getblocktemplate, miners will be able to react almost instantly.

Yes, pools assign a certain range for each miner to work in. That is how they can guarantee none of their miners are doing redundant work.
All you would need to do is send the miners the block header parts of a previous block and tell them to work in the range A-&gt;B where the correct nonce of the block was A&lt;X&lt;B.

Nope. You can have a shitty client that just strips off the checksum of the address without checking it.
The protocol doesn't know what an address is. Your transactions are either pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH) for the 1- addresses or pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) for the 3- addresses. The checksums are stripped from the address to get the public key or script hash to which the transaction pays.

To be honest, I think a lot of miners are just not very skilled at math. Most Bitcoin users at one point wonder whether or not they should mine. The ones that are decent at math look up some mining equipment prices, do the calculations, and almost always find that mining equipment is probably going to be a negative ROI. So they don't do it.
The ones that do make it past this point are either too lazy to do the math, bad at math, or have somehow come up with a way to actually have a positive ROI. And so we have a mining community compromised of a few miners with large rigs that actually profit and a ton of other people with crap from Butterfly labs that have no idea what they are doing.
These people relate variance with profitability, assume bigger pools mean bigger payouts, and voila! Tons of people mine on Ghash.
As for Ghash sabotaging other pools by directing hashpower to them and withholding blocks... I don't think there is any real evidence to either prove or disprove it. It is an interesting possibility, though.

What you can do is avoid asking for payments to the same address.
So I guess if somebody sends you money to an address you didn't ask them to, for no reason, I'm obviously not going to blame you for address reuse. Enjoy your free money and move on. What's bad is intentionally asking for payments to the same address, and especially wallets that automatically reuse addresses for change (looking at you, most mobile wallets).

I'm not really going to disagree with you here. It probably could have been a little better if the supply was spread a little longer.
However, I do not see this as a critical threat to the success of Bitcoin. It was a sub-optimal parameter in the tuning of Bitcoin, but it's not going to lead to failure. Do you think it will?
And then of course, where can we go from here? There isn't much you can do about it other than to create your own coin (or fork) with a different supply rate. But then you have the huge problem of the network effect. Bitcoin has a very large and concrete userbase. Your new coin/fork would not.
Would you mind just answering these two questions?

2. Do you have any proposed solution?

Well, all currencies have floating values and can go up and down.
For sure, though. Bitcoin is much more volatile than your USD, EUR, etc. The volatility will continue to reduce over time as the currency matures and adoption increases.
For now, though, you can just use it in small amounts as a consumer. Nobody is asking you to convert your life savings into BTC. Set up an account at Coinbase or a similar service, and just buy $100 worth. Pick your favorite consumer wallet and withdraw the coins to it from Coinbase. Now you can start spending bitcoins at places that accept it! If you start to run low, just buy some more to replenish your wallet.

Cryptocurrency is a valuable creation. For the first time, you can memorize a piece of property. You can send nearly instant, irreversible payments over these networks. Of the various cryptocurrency networks (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc.), Bitcoin is by far the most secure because it has, by far, the highest proof of work in hashrate.
Now consider that only one type of currency is accepted on this network, and there is a hard limit of ~21M of this currency.

This wasn't a problem until ASICs started being developed because everyone had easy access to CPU mining.
Now it's a race for each hardware developer to be the first to make the next generation of chip size. The huge advantage in smaller chip sizes and the difficulty in buying them is what has been centralizing the hashrate.
We're getting very close to the lower limits of chip size. Once we get there, I think we'll see the availability of efficient mining hardware start to increase again and the hashrate will once again decentralize.

Every user has some master public key with which they sign "I trust X" messages. You independently list merchants/customers/friends/etc. that you trust. They would all be 1 degree of separation from you, and your client would weight feedback given by these people very heavily.
All of the people trusted by the people you listed personally as trusted would then be 2 degrees of separation from you. Their feedback would be weighted less by your client.
Etc. for further degrees of separation.
If somebody creates 1000 shell accounts to give themselves feedback, everyone else would generally ignore the feedback because their client would ignore the not-well-connected/trusted shell accounts. The person could have all of the shell accounts trust each other, but that still doesn't make a connection of trust to the real people viewing feedback.
You would need to get this cluster of shell accounts trusted by real people. It would require them to convince one of the people you trust to sign a message of trust for a shell account. Sure, that can happen, but something like this could be easily detected and you can remove your no-longer-trustworthy friend from your personal web of trust.

Here's the full interview, with the Bitcoin part: 
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:47:31
If your goal is offline cash backed by cryptocurrency, you probably aren't going to find a cryptography-based solution. There is a reason Bitcoin uses the block chain and requires being online. If Bitcoin could have been done without a public ledger (requiring being online), it would have.
The best you can do is to either literally make cash backed in cryptocurrency by the issuer or put the keys to the cryptocurrency itself in the cash. It would be about as easy to make as fiat currency. An issuing bank can put in various anti-counterfeiting measures and just promise to pay anyone in cryptocurrency to redeem it. The other option, putting the keys inside the cash, would be done so that the coins could be redeemed without needing to go to the issuing bank and request the redemption. It would require both anti-counterfeiting measures and tamper-evident measures.
If your goal is instant confirmation payments (not offline payments), then the best solution I have found is green addresses.
The problem with 0-confirmation transactions it that the sender could sign a second transaction to double-spend the coins. However, if the transactions from green addresses also required the signature by a trusted centralized entity that never signs a double spend transaction, you don't really need to wait for block confirmations.
I realize that it is not ideal to trust centralized entities, but this would only be an optional feature. If a merchant doesn't want to trust green addresses, they can just wait for the confirmations like any other address. Additionally, you could increase the splitting of the keys so that, for example, 3 different trusted entities need to sign off on a green address's transactions. That would spread out the trust and add a little bit of decentralization.

A proper bitcoin transaction propagates to almost every node in about 8 seconds. There isn't much opportunity in that for you to find the transaction with your own node, change the transaction id, and rebroadcast it to a significant enough portion of the network to get your transaction mined before the original one.
So yes, I'll grant you that it is **possible**, the only way that this was conducted in practice is that Mt. Gox was issuing transactions that failed.

Don't worry about colored coins. The idea isn't to say "This Bitcoin is better than that one." It is simply a way of adding value to satoshis by attaching them to something. The fungibility of paper isn't ruined when a few people start printing stock certificates on them.
Most importantly, it will be practically impossible to use coloring to decrease the value of any coins. This is because you would need to convince *all* Bitcoin users that a "black" coin is unacceptable. This won't happen.
If some organization of people decided that your coins are tainted and not to be accepted, I would simply offer to mix our coins together so that now both of ours are "tainted." So would a ton of other people, and this organization would effectively only be secluding themselves from trading.
Fungibility is important and luckily easy to defend.

The longer the attacker waits, the more difficult it becomes to reverse a transaction because that transaction would get more confirmations as blocks are mined.
On average, you would expect about 30 confirmations after 5 hours. The attacker would need to create a new fork starting before this transaction. With only a small (~2%) advantage over the rest of the network, it would take a while for the attacker's fork to catch up to the main chain with a 30-block spread.
That's the main problem, though, with 51%. If the attacker can maintain more than 50% of the hash rate, they *will* eventually be able to double-spend after any amount of confirmations.
With someone who has only 30% of the hash rate, they could try to double-spend a 1-confirmation transaction and have a chance of being successful. Again, see the whitepaper for a mathematical description of the probability of a successful double-spend.

Pools calculate their displayed hash rate based on the shares being submitted, not the blocks they mine.


Unless they are using something such as getblocktemplate (many do not) to make their coinbase transactions transparent to the miners, they can "hide" blocks that they mine by not putting their pool name in the coinbase, having it pay out to a non-publicized address, and relaying the block with a proxy.

If you can spare about $500, I would have them all install wallets and give them each $1 worth (leave a $1 paper wallet under each of their seats maybe?).
Then load 4 donation addresses (ex: Sean's Outpost, Electronic Frontier Foundation, The Seasteading Institute, and Khan Academy) side-by-side on blockchain.info. Have them choose to either scan the QR code of their choice and donate the $1 or keep the $1 themselves.
Watch in awe as the donations roll in on the blockchain.info interface.
Edit: Another idea for dispersing the coins to the audience would be to give $20 to 25 people and ask them to tip it around to the people near them.
Edit 2: For those with Apple phones, they can use Coinpunk.

Bull fucking shit.
Bitcoin does not require you to have a credit score to open an account. It doesn't only allow licensed individuals to participate. The block chain doesn't care if you are a refrigerator. If you have a private key with funds in the associated address, you have equal access to the block chain as another person/refrigerator with a private key and funds in the associated address.


All you can do to keep BTC is not spend it. Once a rich person spends a coin, that coin is no longer theirs.
This is why it is a level playing field, and the current system is not. Central banks give preferential treatment to the large corporate banks that own them, and lobby the government to bail them out. Nobody can lobby the block chain.

As long as you trust the two banks, your transaction can be considered finalized as soon as they say it is.
Of course, I would rather the system remain more decentralized than require banks and clearing houses for transactions.

You can check the balance of any address. It's all on the block chain.
If somebody "stole" your watch-only wallet, they would be able to know which addresses are yours. So they could then pin that balance to you. Sure.
Although you could put any address in a watch-only wallet, so you could have plausible deniability of owning that balance by just saying you set up the wallet to watch some addresses for fun that weren't yours.

fiat: a formal authorization or proposition; a decree.
The reason they are called fiat currencies is that they are given their value from the "decree" of their government. Bitcoin doesn't have this decree, and it is why we separate it from fiat.
You're probably thinking of fiat currency as being not-backed-by-gold or something similar. Those are misconceptions. [Fiat money is money that derives its value from government regulation or law.](

Bitmessage does not use any currency. The block chain is kept at ~2 days old (messages removed after 2 day expiration) and messages are only allowed to be added if the sender submits an accompanying proof-of-work.

It would be cool to have a similar system where BTC are used instead of pure proof-of-work, though.

The coinbase transaction is included in the block. You can't mine a block and then change the coinbase transaction to go to yourself.
If you don't include the correct coinbase transaction to reward all of the miners in the network according to P2Pool protocol, the network of miners would reject your submitted shares and not include you in the P2Pool coinbase transaction. So you either mine for P2Pool or for yourself, you can't do both.

[Bitalo]( uses 2-of-2 multisig wallets. One key is yours, and the other remains on Bitalo servers. They use two-factor authentication so that for each transaction you make, you must verify with a 2-factor authentication app that basically asks "YES or NO?"

If you think it's hard to plan for predefined reward functions, try planning based on the decisions of the Federal Reserve. Really, the hard part of miners' calculations is the difficulty which is based on the dynamic hash rate of the network.
I'm not sure why Satoshi chose reward halving rather than a steady decrease. He probably described the decision somewhere, but I don't recall it at the moment.
It's probably easier for rounding issues. I guess it's also easier for miners' short-term calculations when not approaching the halving event. It's also a bit more elegant of a solution, I suppose.
Or perhaps he worried that with a constant rate of change, it would be easier for the community to argue over what the number should be and attempt to change it. The reward halving structure is not so easy to adjust.

First of all, don't mine. It is nearly impossible to ever profit more than you would have by just buying the coin outright.
Second, I recommend avoiding altcoins for the most part. The vast majority of them are "pump and dump" scams with nearly no innovative advantages.
Finally, I recommend doing your own research before investing any significant amount of value in any cryptocurrency. Nearly all of my assets are Bitcoin right now, but that's because I have invested a lot of time in researching it and have come to my own conclusions. You may very well come to a different conclusion. Don't go around asking on Reddit for investment advice. That's stupid.

Sure, maybe you *should* use a different Bitcoin address for every new transaction for privacy reasons. But sometimes you want to be transparent, and it's great for a charity to be able to post one public address that the world can verify.

Saving money actually provides an investment by lowering prices. If there are less dollars out there fetching goods, the price of goods decreases and every dollar that is spent by businesses stretches farther.
Consider saving money to be an investment in the entire economy. You're letting a business (or other consumers) buy goods today, and you are willing to wait until tomorrow. An inflationary currency just leads to everyone wanting everything today. It's not good.

Backups are sent via email.
Edit: And I was slightly incorrect. They do not email the Bitalo key, but instead email a transaction presigned with their key to send the funds to your external address. All you would need to do is sign the transaction with your own key and propagate it. This is also safer than them sending the private key itself.

It depends on the chronological order of the bids/asks.
If the first person asks for $500 but there are no bids to complete the order, that $500 ask gets added to the order book to wait. Now somebody else bids $1000 and gets matched with the lowest available asks in the order book, which might be that $500 ask.

@_date: 2014-12-28 07:29:55
To list just a few reasons:
1. It increases your privacy.
2. It increases the general privacy of the block chain by creating more "noise" which adds plausible deniability for other users.
3. It avoids having coins "stored" at an address for which the public key (not the public key hash) is known, which saves you from certain attack vectors I won't describe in detail. This is that R-value stuff is talking about.
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:05:17
If your coins are in cold storage, it would probably take a while to initiate a second transaction. The first one would already have propagated throughout the entire network (It takes about 7 seconds to reach 99%+ of the nodes) and most nodes will just completely ignore your second transaction as a double spend.
You *could* incentivize miners in theory to mine your second transaction instead by placing a higher fee, but at the moment most mining software is also using the original rules and will ignore your second transaction regardless of the fee. By the time mining software has been updated to be more selfish and mine your second transaction instead, thieves will also likely have updated their strategy and would simply issue a third transaction with an even higher fee.
It's safe to conclude that if somebody malicious has a copy of your private keys, your coins should be considered as good as gone.
I think multisignature will ultimately be the best deterrent to theft.

Yes, I was offered my choice of BTC, USD, or EUR. I chose BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:20:27


This would make sense, because otherwise there would be the reverse problem. If the value of BTC went up in the middle of the purchase and they were holding the BTC, they could cancel the order and refund you less BTC.
The choice of refund method should be of the party not at fault for the cancellation.

Yep. Bitcoin Core generates new change addresses for as far back as I can remember, and I'm assuming it always did.

I'm already a full-time student with a part-time job and more side work than I can keep up with, but I *could* work on this. It's hard to give an exact quote on what I would want in compensation, but I can tell you that the server itself would run you a pretty good bill.
I also question how popular this pool would be. All of the mined bitcoins get donated to charity, or just the pool fee of like 2%? Most of the miners that want to donate to charity have already just set up their miner accounts to send payments to the donation address. The pool doesn't have to do any of the work.
Not to put the idea down, though. I love charity and SeansOutpost is great. Mining pools are also fun software to work with

1. I would rather not trust third parties with my financial information. (A credit card's public key *is* it's private key, etc.)

3. I prefer hard payments over debt-based transactions. When I do need to use USD, I still prefer cash over credit.

Miners do not have all of the power.
Should 99% of ASIC SHA-256 miners decide to do a hard fork that, say, doubles the rate at which coins are produced at a certain point, their blocks would immediately be rejected by all standard Bitcoin clients.
Anyone can make a hard fork. If you wanted to, you could go back and change the rules starting at block 20 and easily produce your own chain. However, unless you can convince most of the wallet development teams to change their code, most of the merchants to accept your new coins, and most of the regular users to use this new fork, it is without value.
Should a majority of miners decide to create their own fork, they could  threaten the merchants, developers, and users to switch to the new fork or they will begin 51% attacking the original chain. However, we could simply change our mining algorithm to something other than SHA-256 which would render their ASICs useless and worthless. That would have a cost on the Bitcoin network because there is value in having an established distributed hashrate already in the ASIC stage. The cost on the SHA-256 miners would, however, be greater.
The Bitcoin ecosystem has these natural checks and balances in place. There are no courts, no legislators, and no politicians. There are, however, these natural rules mutually agreed to by all who use the block chain.
It's beautiful, really :)
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:23:15
They don't need Coinbase/Bitpay to process Bitcoin transactions. That's the magic of Bitcoin. The main service BtiPay/Coinbase are providing is the BTC-&gt;fiat conversion, and that's the part they're taking fees on. They generally offer the transaction processing for free just as a convenience.
@_date: 2014-08-08 05:29:08
The block chain is a ledger of transactions. Everybody using a full Bitcoin client has a copy of this ledger.
When you send bitcoins to an address, you're just making a transaction that basically says "Move these coins to that address."
Anybody with the private key to that address can than claim the funds from that transaction when making a new transaction.
There is no "registering" with the block chain. All addresses that can exist do exist. We just aren't using all of them (and never will, there is an unimaginably large quantity of them) and we don't know the private keys to all of them.
PS: When you make an address, this is the general process:
1. Generate a random 256-bit number between 0x1 and 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141. This is your private key. You will need it to claim/spend funds sent to the address you are about to create.
2. Run that number through the series of functions defined by the Bitcoin rules to generate a new seemingly-random number.
3. Convert the resulting number into Bitcoin address format. That's your address. You generated it completely offline and without "talking to" the block chain in any way.

Contracts are a thing. As a potential employee, you have the right to demand an employment contract that requires your employer to be liable for damages caused to you by your work environment. If your employer doesn't agree to this, find a different one. Employers aren't these almighty gods that can do whatever they want to you unless restrained by the magical government. There is an employment market, and they are held accountable to the whims of the market. If you don't want to work in a dangerous environment without safety precautions and external liability, don't offer yourself on the market for it.

I applaud you on actually having a grasp of the facts before making a criticism, but I think your diagnosis is wrong.
Every miner has their own electricity cost. The difficulty increases incrementally. Mining does not suddenly become unprofitable for everyone. It becomes unprofitable for a small number of miners at a time, and those miners can simply shut their machines off. The network hashrate would decrease, and the difficulty would adjust accordingly.
If the opposite happens again, and it becomes profitable for miners that were previously unprofitable, they will turn their miners back on (incrementally, again) and increase the network hashrate.
You will see the market constantly reaching for equilibrium.

If he dumps 1,000,000 BTC on the market at once (and assuming the market was already under the assumption that he and his bitcoins were dead and gone), that would increase the effective currency supply by less than 10%.
Is 10% significant? Eh. It's quite a bit, but compared to the shenanigans pulled by central banks 10% is nothing. The value of a USD has decreased 96% since the creation of the Federal Reserve.
And again, it would be a one-time 10% haircut on the value of BTC. One time.

To your edit:


The Android problem wasn't so much an issue with random address creation, but with the transaction signing process. I can't really speak to RNG security and quality. I think that's an issue we'll always be improving but might never be able to prove 100% confidently for all RNG software implementations. So why make yourself even more vulnerable?
As for it being a hassle, it really shouldn't be. The Android wallet developers could have made some very simple one-time differences in the code to handle addresses and no users would have had to deal with the problem themselves.
As for being able to publish one static address, for example, for friends to be able to send you money or for a waiter to collect Bitcoin tips, use stealth addresses. One address to hand out, but still avoiding address reuse under-the-hood.

That's a pyramid scheme, actually, not a ponzi scheme. Similar, but different. A ponzi scheme does not individually require investors to recruit new investors. Ponzi schemes are operated by one entity that does its own recruiting of investors by making payments to previous investors with new investors' money and falsely claiming that the payments were the result of successful proper investment in some other area.
The only difference between a classic ponzi scheme definition and what many (me, OP, etc) are suggesting some cloud mining operators are or at least could be doing is that because their payouts are not even profitable for existing investors, no new investors are required to keep the system going. They can pay each individual investor back (minus losses) with their very own investment funds. This is the only caveat between what we are discussing and the definition of a ponzi scheme, and I will continue using it as the most accurate term available unless a better one is found.

When calculating your average revenue in coins per unit of time at any moment, all that matters is your hash rate, the difficulty, and the coins per block. When planning long term, you will have to consider that the difficulty changes based on the network total hash rate.
slightly tl;dr: To calculate profitability right at this moment, difficulty is all that matters. To plan for what the difficulty will be in the future, you need to consider network hash rate changes.

Nope. Please take some time to learn how markets (and stock markets) work. The price of a stock doesn't go up because people buy it. The price of a stock is the market's best estimate of the value of that stock. A wealthy person buying/selling a stock does not impact the value of that stock.
In effect, buying and dumping huge amounts of stock would just result in Satoshi losing a ton of money and stock traders making it all from him. The economy would be unaffected.

No problem, I'm actually a little embarrassed that I had to backpedal on my original claim. At first I said that adding hash rate to P2Pool has no effect on variance for individual P2Pool miners. It actually ~~increases~~ **decreases** variance for large miners and ~~decreases~~ **increases** variance for small miners. I'm too lazy to do the math on what constitutes small and large, but most miners would be in the small category.


This is true, it's just that P2Pool finding more blocks does not correlate to lower variance for all P2Pool miners because only 8640 shares are awarded per block.
Thanks for the tip!

The 24-word mnemonic for greenaddress is a bit excessive. 12 words is what most mnemonic wallets use, and it's not too difficult to remember 12.
I think the best solution is to use two or three different types of wallets for different purposes. If you have a lot of BTC, you should keep most of it in encrypted paper and hardware backups somewhere safe. Consider these to be similar to the amount of money you would leave in the bank. Then, have another mobile and/or desktop wallet that you use for everyday purchases. This can be slightly less secure, and would be similar to the amount of money you carry in your wallet.
If you're looking for an easier wallet to use, I might suggest [Electrum]( (12-word desktop wallet), [Bitalo]( (2-factor authentication multisig web wallet), or the [Schildbach Wallet]( (for Android).

Sometimes an analogy helps to explain it.
Think of Bitcoin transactions as checks. When somebody pays you, they're giving you a check for that amount. To spend those funds, you just add your signature to the check and hand it to the next person. There is no actual "asset" behind the number written on the check, but there is a limited total balance of all the checks. The difference would be that in this system, you can magically combine and divide checks.

Someone big hopping on to P2Pool does not lower the variance for P2Pool miners.
P2Pool has a block chain of its own with a block/share difficulty just like Bitcoin, but it retargets to have one block/share every 30 seconds rather than every 10 minutes.
If you add hash rate to P2Pool, the P2Pool block/share difficulty will adjust. In effect, Petamine moving to P2Pool would approximately mean that P2Pool would find 3x more blocks, but each miner would be 1/3x as likely to find a share. Net effect on the variance for each miner: none.

I think the problem is that is not using the standard meaning of a playing field.
A playing field is an analogy where teams compete. If the playing field is not level, one team has an unfair advantage over the other (moving downhill vs uphill). This analogy carries over to markets, where a level playing field is one in which no artificial barriers are put in place for certain participants as opposed to others.
In this analogy, earning money is compared to advancing your position on the playing field. Teams win and lose, and market participants gain and lose. is requesting that the game be cancelled, and we all have a picnic on the field with an equal distribution of the food. It just doesn't follow with the analogy at all and is misleading for anyone reading his comment.

I don't think you are familiar with how P2Pool works. (Don't feel bad. I didn't really start digging into how it actually works until recently.)
It has a share chain similar to the Bitcoin block chain. The minimum share difficulty is adjusted so that one share is found every 30 seconds. When a share is found that meets the main Bitcoin difficulty requirement, it rewards a 0.5% subsidy to the miner that found it and the other 99.5% of the block reward is evenly distributed to each miner of the last 8640 shares.
In effect, mining on P2Pool is almost exactly like solo mining, but blocks are found every 30 seconds instead of every 10 minutes and the block reward is a share which gives you a chance of getting a payout.


It is still quite high.
The P2Pool share difficulty is currently 1,592,413. Compared to Bitcoin's difficulty of 11,756,551,917, that seems pretty good, but most pools are awarding shares for difficulties more in the region of 1 to 1024.
And this only gets worse when you add hash rate to P2Pool. The difficulty retargetting algorithm would make it even harder to find a share.

What's wrong with this, other than the fact that 99% of the people that say it don't actually know why they're saying it?
It seems perfectly logical to accept the value of block chain technology, but to disagree with the Bitcoin implementation of it. There are lots of parameters that can be tweaked (for the better?), which most altcoins do. Target block rate, issuance rate, etc.
I certainly don't think tweaking any of these parameters could possibly be more valuable than the network effect that Bitcoin already has. But only time will tell the answer, won't it?

Even pretending that bin Laden was just some rich guy, he killed about 3,500 people. That's about 0.03% of the people killed by the Nazis in World War II.

revenue/day = block reward * blocks / day
revenue/day = block reward * 86400 * (blocks/second)
revenue/day = block reward * 86400 * (hashes/second / (difficulty * 2^(32)))
**revenue/day = hashrate * 86400 * (block reward) / (difficulty * 2^32)**
While typing this, the current conditions are:
revenue/day = hashrate * (25 BTC (standard reward) + 0.05 (approximate transaction fees)) * 86400 / (27428630902 * 2^32)
For a 1 Th/s miner, you would have:
revenue/day = 1000000000000 * (25 BTC (standard reward) + 0.05 (approximate transaction fees)) * 86400 / (27428630902 * 2^32)
revenue/day = 0.018372 BTC

Difficulty wouldn't be a major problem. It would require another hard-fork, but it would be a fork that the developers/merchants/users would likely agree to as opposed to the mining reward change in the miners' fork. The new change would simply lower the difficulty to a reasonable level. Problem solved.
The real problem would be the risk of a 51% attack by the miners in order to ruin the original chain and "incentivize" the users/developers/merchants to switch. To counter this would require a less desirable fork than the difficulty adjustment. We would need to switch mining algorithms to something other than SHA-256. This would bring us back to pre-ASIC mining (which I consider a negative) subverting the 51% attack.
The reason I think going to a pre-ASIC algorithm is bad would be that eventually ASICs will be developed and we'll be right back to where we were anyways. One of the hardest parts of this process is the arms race. Every improvement in chip design gives the designing company a temporary huge percent of network hashrate. The point we are reach with ASICs means that no more of these improvement advantages will be had. It is now a matter of physically producing and maintaining the hardware, which is much less centralized.
I would still support such a change if we got in such a situation, however, as the alternative would be adopting the miners' fork. I suspect most of the developers, merchants, and users would also agree.
Of course, this would all shake confidence in Bitcoin for a while. People don't like conflicts between miners and the rest of the network, and they certainly don't like changing algorithms. But Bitcoin would continue. Everyone's coins would be intact.
And since the miners who began this attack in the first place would end up with nearly worthless ASICs, they would be irrational to attempt it.

I think I just have to disagree with you here. The initial distribution might not be ideal (What is ideal? It's all subjective.) but I don't think it is going to lead to failure.
And the only way to change it is with a new coin or a very severe hard fork. I don't see either of these as particularly likely to succeed.
But then again, if Bitcoin does fail because of the distribution model, so what? We do have plenty of alt-coins such as Auroracoin that use different models. May the best coin win.

I've been trying to come up with a solution for NDAs recently. Unfortunately, NDAs suck because IP is practically impossible to enforce.
I want to come up with a way for me to sign a NDA for a business partner with some idea, to not share/steal that idea. The problem is that he would have no proof that it was *me* to shared the idea with someone privately, as opposed to somebody else independently coming up with that idea in parallel. Which would just mean that he would have no guarantee that his IP is safe, and I would have some arbitrary obligation hanging over my head.
Your best bet might be to just have the information placed in the block chain with proof of existence (see comment) and then also put proof of existence into the block chain for you signing a NDA using PGP.
If you broke the agreement, he would be able to make the NDA public and prove when you signed it via proof of existence.
But again, it doesn't really guarantee anything. Because IP sucks.

Limitation of the block size is an interesting and important problem. I have reasons to believe that this problem will be solved.
Once Bitcoin reaches full adoption, the block chain size will grow linearly. Bandwidth and storage will, however, probably continue to grow exponentially. This means that the block chain will be growing slower than the computers and networks needed to maintain it, so we can just continue increasing the block size when necessary and not have major repercussions.

We *do* discuss problems that are actual problems still in need of a solution. One of those problems is the Bitcoin Foundation, and you have seen that discussed on the front page plenty of times. Some guy just awarded $100,000 for a solution and $10,000 to the runner-up.

If you're going to be hodling a large value in BTC, it's worth the investment to do this:
* Buy a dedicated, old, crappy computer that you use for nothing but this wallet and never connect to the internet.
* Put Linux on it.
* Get an old, crappy, printer.
* Put a copy of bitaddress.org (Right-click, Save as...) onto a flash drive from your normal computer.
* Copy the file from the flash drive to your old, crappy computer.
* Open up the bitadress.org saved copy and generate as many paper wallets as you want, with BIP-38 protection using a passphrase. **Don't forget/lose the passphrase**.
* Use your old, crappy printer to make 2 copies of each wallet.
* Deposit coins onto the public address of your paper wallets.
* Put one copy of each wallet into very safe places in two different buildings. Possibly one in a safe in your house and one in a safety deposit box or relative's safe.
*

@_date: 2014-06-14 00:11:13


Crap. This is embarrassing, but I need to backpedal a little bit.
It actually depends also on the size of the miner relative to P2Pool.
If you are a small miner who barely finds any shares, adding hash rate to P2Pool would increase your variance as you will find less shares. If you are a large miner, it will slightly decrease your variance as you will still be finding a reasonable amount of shares and each share will be more likely to be rewarded.
Very few miners are large enough to be able to benefit (and the benefit would be small) from adding hash rate to P2Pool, and it would be even less so if P2Pool were a significant (20% or so) portion of the total network.

Generally, salting means that you add some extra random input to the end of a passphrase before hashing it, not editing the passphrase itself. In reality, you have pretty much the same effect though.

As for the USPS, they recently took ( ... wait for it ... ) 6+ months to deliver a piece of paper a few states over. Priority, delivery confirmation, etc. 6+ months. There was literally no customer support. Not once did I receive a reply to the "Contact us" attempts.
At least they *allow* competition (to some extent - they don't let others use mailboxes and such) so I can send my next piece of paper through FedEx or someone else.
With some services, I'm not so lucky. Do I want to use the public fire department? Do I want to pay for a police force that locks my neighbors up for smoking a plant? Do I want to pay for a war overseas? Doesn't matter, they're charging me for it.
It is true that some companies aren't very good, but there is a mechanism (competition) in place that motivates them to either get better or get left behind.
With a government, there isn't much motivation to improve. The ultimate accountability falls on the politicians, and they are selected only by a 'majority' of the public every X years.
You are implying that defensive violence is a task too important for the market to handle. As if the governments are the only entity capable of keeping peace. I guess I'm not sure what you consider successful, but this list does not seem to me like something to be proud of: 
As for DRO's getting too large, I don't think this is very reasonable. There are economies of scale, and unless you can show me why one massive corporation would be likely in the DRO industry, I simply don't believe your assertion.
One of the costs in this situation is that people wouldn't *want* to have one massive DRO. It would be far too much trust in a single entity. This is exactly like what we have been seeing in the Bitcoin mining industry. Some pools (ASICMiner) made and held pledges to not go beyond a certain portion of the market. Other pools (GHash) did approach half of the network hashrate, but were quickly prevented from doing so as self-interested miners (the metaphoric customers) switched pools (the metaphoric DROs) in order to maintain the network integrity (the metaphoric peace).

This is true, but it hasn't caused any issues so far, and volatility has only been decreasing as Bitcoin matures.


This would be true, but mining costs are dependent on both the energy consumption per hash, *and* the cost of electricity. The cost of electricity varies greatly among miners, and this is why the number of miners shut off would be a smoother transition.

'Twas not I who downvoted you, but I'd be happy to counter the position.


This is a poor argument to make, as I (and the majority of anarchists over at don't advocate the sudden disappearance of government. We realize this would create a damaging vacuum in the services that government does provide, including law arbitration, defense, fire protection, etc.
I (and many other Ancaps) advocate for the slow dissolution of government, so that the market has time to prepare for and slowly accommodate for these services.
We also believe that if the government does not voluntarily dissolve slowly, the market will eventually create better alternatives for its services. One of the services government provided was distanced communication, through the postal service. Over time, companies like FedEx and UPS started to compete by providing better/cheaper services, and eventually the service was made almost completely useless by the Internet.
The same is happening with currency. Bitcoin replaces the need for a central bank. The same thing is being developed for law arbitration. Smart contracts on Ethereum or other platforms will replace the need for a supreme court.
The same can happen with defense. It seems like the entire outline you're standing behind completely ignores the mechanics behind DROs (dispute resolution organizations).
I don't have the time or room here on Reddit to explain DROs to you, but I invite you to watch this video:

Do you not see irony in funding theft prevention with theft? Why not just let opt-in business models take care of theft prevention just like everything else?
I mean, I'm with you 100% on wanting to at least get the government way down in size to the point where all it does is enforce basic rights to life, liberty, and property. That would be a huge win.

If you really don't trust yourself to remember the password, at least still encrypt the paper wallet before printing but then write the password on the wallet.
Why? Because encrypting before printing will remove the possibility of your coins being stolen with a compromised printer. If you encrypt first, you could even (although I wouldn't recommend it) print your wallets off on a public printer.

I didn't leave any previous job, but my current job certainly wouldn't be possible without Bitcoin.
I'm a software engineering college student working for a multi-service Bitcoin company. My employer is on a different continent, and we agreed to payment in bitcoins. This was the easiest route, as we don't have to deal with the banking industry at all. It is also the cheapest, with a cost of about 6 cents (soon to be less) per paycheck.
Right now I'm finishing a mining pool for them. As soon as this is finished, I will resume working on a mobile HTML5 wallet for Apple users to have mobile access to the company's multi-signature wallet service.

If was correct, I would be much less hesitant, because then you at least have *some* market mechanism where adding more transactions increases the cost.

If it is true that customers do not spend appreciating currency because it will be worth more tomorrow, would it not also be true that businesses do not accept depreciating currency because it will be worth less tomorrow?
By the time Bitcoin matures to relative stability, do you think that a small amount of appreciation is going to significantly impact how much people buy?

I personally don't think the mining scene affects the price much, but rather the price dictates the mining scene.
If the value of a coin goes up, miners are able to incur a higher mining cost, so the network hashrate will go up. It doesn't really work the other way around, because if everyone switches to more efficient ASICs, then the difficulty just goes up and nothing really changes on the economics of the coin itself.
@_date: 2014-06-11 03:29:52

I'd like to clarify that a Bitcoin address is not a wallet. Further, there is no such thing as a "from" address. Sites such as blockchain.info are very misleading in their representation of the block chain as such.
An address is used only as a sort of invoice/receipt system. They should not be reused (this hurts the anonymity of your wallet) for multiple payments.
There is indeed a spectrum of anonymity available with Bitcoin. You could be fully transparent, fully anonymous, or somewhere in between. Measuring the anonymity of your usage doesn't really have a single formula. There are various methods of analyzing transaction history to tie coins and identities together.
If you're looking to increase anonymity, here are a few tips:
1. Don't reuse addresses when receiving payment (this includes not reusing addresses for change).
2. Don't send to addresses that have been used before.
3. Use systems such as coinjoin to mix your transaction with others in order to add plausible deniability.

You said that governments are actual entities because they're like ant colonies.
The problem with your comparison is that ants of a colony are all nearly identical. They don't act in their own self-interest.
The people that make up a government are all very different. They have their own goals, personalities, desires, and actions. Police officers aren't just some arm of government. They don't really care about upholding the law. They're just trying to get a paycheck, and they get it from somebody in payroll also working to get paid. Government employees aren't atomic units of government. They're individual people that perform functions under the banner of government.

Usage is a chicken and egg problem, but that's s problem that solves itself if the benefits of use are high enough. Bitcoin itself has a chicken and egg problem, but we see merchants and users taking the leap to become the first generation of Bitcoiners. I'm sure more developers will be adding stealth address support if no better alternatives are found for the purpose.
I didn't suggest stealth addresses for ASF. That was in response to the question about people wanting to put up a sign on TV saying "Mom, please send Bitcoin" with a static address.

You're wrong about them being able to collectively veto anything.
If 95% of the miners/pools colluded to go against the will of users and merchants, two potential things could happen depending on the type of argument.
If it's a hard fork (major protocol difference) then the 95% of miners would be mining an unused chain while the other 5% mine the valuable chain that users are using.
If it's a soft fork and they just aren't doing what we want (double spending, not putting transactions in blocks, etc.) we could just change the proof-of-work if it is a serious enough problem.

To add more detail:
There is no master server. Bitcoin clients are usually seeded with a list of several default IP addresses that host nodes. This list is used to bootstrap yourself into the network. From those nodes, your client will get the IP addresses of other nodes to connect to in the future.
Before this bootstrap list came about, nodes used to connect to an IRC server and broadcast themselves so that they could find initial peers.

After that, you *could* learn PHP for server-side programming, but I've come to dislike it over the years.

Bitcoin mining began as CPU-only. Everyone had relatively similar hash rates and easy access to mining equipment (a computer), so the global hashing power was very decentralized.
Once software was developed for GPU mining, CPUs became obsolete and more hash rate was concentrated in less physical hardware. GPUs were slightly less accessible, and so the global hashing power was slightly less decentralized.
Then came ASICs, a huge leap toward centralization. The difference in hashing power concentration from a GPU to an ASIC is enormous, and the ability to purchase and maintain these is only eclipsed in difficulty by the ability to manufacture them. With the development of ASICs, miners turned off their GPUs (or redirected them to other coins) and the global hashing power continued to centralize.
This is continuing as each generation (smaller chip sizes) of ASIC is developed. Old ASICs are becoming obsolete and whoever is first to manufacture the latest generation is going to have a significant advantage over everyone else.
ASIC transistors can only be made so small, however. Once you get down to around 16 nm, physics stops playing nicely. 20 nm Bitcoin mining chips are already being used. Now that we are approaching the limit in chip sizes, there won't be any more temporary prizes of having an advantage over everyone else for developing the next generation of mining equipment. It will come down to a matter of only physically producing and powering the chips.
As more companies produce the same final-generation chips, they will become more accessible to everyone and the global hashing power will once again begin to decentralize.
tl;dr: Hodl tight, we're almost over the hump.

That's crony capitalism, and I will oppose as wholeheartedly as you do.


I would indeed counter with the ability for DROs to network with each other. This in itself would be that each DRO requires less defensive force to protect its clients. What I do not understand is how you reached the conclusion that this would limit innovation.
If a DRO finds a way to lower its costs by 10% and maintain the same level of security, then it can go ahead and do so. It could lower prices slightly to get more customers, keep the profit for itself, or a likely combination of both. The other DROs would eventually follow suit. Any DRO that doesn't would lose customers and fail.
What is making you think otherwise?

If you send bitcoins in the simplest fashion as most people currently are, you are using them like cash. If the runners had given cash to the race organizers, they would be in the same situation as if they had sent bitcoins.
The solution is to build the services that credit card companies provide, consumer protection in particular, as a new method of sending bitcoins. This can easily be done with multisignature transactions.
Example solution: X acts as a BTC transaction arbitration company, just like VISA acts as a USD transaction arbitration company. You have a multisignature consumer wallet for day-to-day purchases such as race registration fees. In this consumer wallet, each address has 2 private keys and requires 2 signatures to complete a transaction. You own two keys and X owns the other one. When you pay your registration fees, you sign the transaction with only one of your keys and deliver the half-signed transaction to the organizers. X ensures that if the organizers complete their end of the deal, X will provide their signature.
Scenario 1: The organizers hold up their end of the sale and put on a successful race. You notify X and they sign off on the transaction.
Scenario 2: The organizers run off with the worthless half-signed transaction. You notify X and they do not sign off on the transaction.
You can modify the M (number of private keys) and N (number of signatures required) for this scenario and even include multiple arbitration companies to spread out the trust factor. All of the signing and information pushing can be abstracted into the software itself to leave a clean and easy-to-use interface for the user.

* Block chain size is too large for the average person to run a full node.
Once full adoption is reached, the block chain will begin growing at a more linear rate, while hardware capacity will continue to grow exponentially. Problem solved. Additionally, not everyone needs to run a full node.
* Bitcoin can only handle about 7 transactions per second. That's not enough for full global adoption.
    if (blockheight &lt;x){
       sizelimit = a;
    }
    else{
       sizelimit = b;
    }
* Mining consumes way too much energy. It's bad for the environment.
Printing fiat money consumes plenty more resources than the Bitcoin network. Also, if Bitcoin can remove the need for any banks, that is quite a bit of energy savings. Consider how much it costs to heat and light a bank.
Even ignoring the energy benefits of Bitcoin replacing the old system, the economic benefits of Bitcoin itself outweigh the costs.
* SHA-256 or other dependent cryptography could be broken.
If SHA-256 is broken, we have bigger problems on our hands. This is the same crypto used to secure military equipment.
Also, crypto algorithms aren't broken instantaneously. It has always been a process of finding one weakness at a time that just makes it slightly easier and easier each time to break. We would have plenty of advance warning before it became a serious problem. In that instance, we could just do this:
    if (blockheight &lt;x){
       algorithm = a;
    }
    else{
       algorithm = b;
    }
* There aren't enough coins for everyone \ what if too many coins are destroyed/lost?
There are 2,100,000,000,000,000 atomic units. We are going to have plenty for a long time. If it becomes absolutely necessary, the code can be forked to allow further division.

Your transaction fee is only 47 satoshis? I'm guessing you realize already that's why it isn't being confirmed.
As for the solution, your bitcoins aren't in limbo during a transaction like you might expect. You can just use the same private keys to sign a brand new transaction that does have a fair transaction fee and broadcast that. I don't think Bitcoin-qt has any method that allows you to do this directly from that wallet, though.
So what you're going to need to do is back up your wallet.dat file and then import the private keys into a new wallet. That wallet shouldn't even know you ever tried this transaction, and it will show your full balance. You can then proceed to create a new proper transaction.

(Not offended, and my apologies if I did the same)


I expect that most large mining operations will be built in locations where energy is cheap.


Not a problem even if you did. I welcome criticism and suggestions.


The problem here is a technical one. It is best for the problem required for mining to be a unique one not paralleled with other goals. The process *needs* to be a waste otherwise. Mining needs to be a nonsense proof-of-work in order to secure the network. I'm guessing you understand why, but if not feel free to research/ask.
I think it is important to understand the benefits of Bitcoin and that they vastly outweigh the negatives. Unless somebody can think of a way to remove the negative of energy consumption (again, technically not practical as the proof-of-work is fundamental to the entire concept) we just need to accept it.
Also, this can be seen as a benefit in the long run. With mining chips now reaching the lower thresholds of size, I expect the hash rate and production of equipment to become more linear rather than exponential. When that happens, nearly all focus for mining profitability will be on cheap energy rather than fast hardware. With the direct ability to turn energy directly into currency anywhere, there will be a universal market force driving for cheaper and more efficient energy. Expect investments into energy innovation.
And of course, you should probably compare the environmental impact of Bitcoin to the environmental impact of the industry it is replacing. We will need far fewer banks (very expensive to build, heat, light, etc.) to handle our money. We also won't need to waste energy and resources printing fiat money.

The probability of finding *x blocks* during a period of *t* minutes would be:
P(x, t) = e^(-tλ) * (tλ)^x / x!
For your example of 0 blocks (x=0) in 100 years (t = 60 * 24 * 365.242 * 100):
P(x=0, t=52594848) = e^(-52594848 * 0.1) * (52594848 * 0.1)^0 / 0!
P(x=0, t=52594848) = 1/e^5259484.8

How do you measure the economy?
I would probably measure it based on how efficiently resources are being used to maximize a population's happiness. In this respect, a slightly deflationary currency (which is what Bitcoin will be when/if it reaches mass adoption and this growth spike ends) that slightly dials back the population's spending and consumption to save more resources for future (and more efficient) consumption is probably a good thing for the economy.
If you measure it based on GDP, like a lot of people, then sure. Spending less = bad economy. But with this definition, people getting sick is good for the economy because it boosts the healthcare industry. Breaking windows would also be great for the economy because it would boost the window-replacing industry. GDP is just a measure of people doing stuff..

Explain that Bitcoin is a protocol similar to TCP/IP of the internet, that functions as a public ledger of ownership. Money is the first application being used on this protocol, and we call the currency bitcoins. More applications will be designed on top of the Bitcoin protocol such as colored coins, proof of existence, and P2P exchanges, just as applications like video chat, image sharing, and chat rooms were built on top of the TCP/IP protocol.

On the receiving end, I get money sent to me from a different hemisphere at the cost of about 5 cents and it gets confirmed in 10 minutes. No complaints from me.
I mostly spend BTC online (Overstock, etc.), where the order is confirmed and I get my receipt without any confirmations. The item doesn't even ship within the hour anyways, so confirmation really isn't an issue. When I do spend at local merchants, they also take 0-confirmation payments for a number of reasons.
1. Double-spending a &lt;$100 payment isn't usually worth the effort.
2. If I were to double-spend a transaction, they would have me on camera just like any other thief.
3. There is already some sense of trust in consumers for small amounts (leaving payment on the table at restaurants, paying tips without *having* to pay tips, etc.).
4. Bitcoin confirmation time is about 10 minutes to an hour. Checks can bounce, and credit cards can be charged back weeks or months later.
1, 3, and 4 aren't "good enough" for me to be confident in Bitcoin, but 2 is pretty solid.

I'm paid in bitcoins by an employer on a different continent. It's very easy. Send an invoice with a Bitcoin address and a fiat amount due. They purchase the equivalent amount of BTC on an exchange and forward the funds to you.
If your employer is not open to doing a small amount of set-up work, then there is not much you can do. Perhaps if you explained the savings potential for fees they would be more interested. They might spend $250 worth of time setting up the account, but it would save that much within 5 payments.

I think the counterpoint to what you're saying is that we can use block chain technology without Bitcoin by using alternative chains such as Litecoin. We could even make revolutionary block chains such as Ethereum and Bitmessage that either change the function of the currency or remove it entirely.
I do agree with you, though. We're most likely to see protocols for added functionality be built on top of the Bitcoin block chain rather than separate ones, just like HTTP, SMTP, and FTP have all been built on top of TCP/IP rather than as alternatives to TCP/IP.

I'm not interested in bullshit hypotheticals. You can't hijack my work and resell it or you would be doing it.
Artists face an actual problem. They have no working revenue stream for the most part. For many decades, their solution has been record label companies and violence (aggression through the state, does not always lead to violence per set). And how well is that working out? All I hear is artists bitching about the injustice of the high cuts record label companies take and the music sharing industry.
Rather than actual do anything, they just repeat the same failed system again and again expecting different results. Pure insanity according to Einstein, and I would agree with him.
This is why I have no sympathy for people who bitch about piracy. They are nonproductive.
I completely admire and support artists who are attempting to actually fix this problem. There are plenty of new revenue models being tested. I know a local artist who uploads his sets to SoundCloud for free and accepts donations. The free digital music doesn't generate all that much in donations probably, but it's a great way to advertise his talents as a DJ and get more performances. I enjoy listening to his music and appreciate his efforts toward new revenue models, so I donated 25 mBTC. He appreciated it, I appreciated it. He received 100% with no cuts taken by a record label, and I did it voluntarily without threats of aggression by the state.

I might also suggest breaking the word back into the original usage: block chain.
It is literally a chain of blocks. Each "block" contains a bundle of transactions. Approximately every 10 minutes, another block is added to this chain.
The blocks are stored by a regular/full Bitcoin node. You probably wouldn't get much value by looking at the raw files.
As others have said, you would usually use a block explorer such as   or

Thank you. I think one of the main differences is that libertarians see that the state is the ultimate concentration and abuse of power. Many of the problems liberals want to solve, both economic and social, are direct results of the state. If you remove government economic regulation, the vast majority of which is protectionism for large corporations, then smaller businesses would be much more able to compete in the market and wealth would naturally be more distributed.
Instead of recognizing the state as the problem, liberals try to use it as the tool it is to work against the concentrations of wealth and to somehow approve of certain social acts (gay marriage, drug legalization, etc.) when these things wouldn't even exist as problems in the first place without the state.

"proxy bot" isn't a very accurate term for what the pool operator would be doing, but yes. A pool could generate blocks with a misleading coinbase that pays to a separate unspecified address to "hide" some of their found blocks. This problem can be avoided by using something such as getblocktemplate which shows the miners exactly what they are mining, so it could easily be detected if the pool was assigning work for something other than their public records.


Assuming 51% control of the network hash rate, one could perform a double-spend of single-confirmation payments in roughly 20 minutes. They could repeat this attack with decent consistency for as long as they maintain 51%+ of the network hash rate.
I highly suggest reading the whitepaper. It very concisely details how this works and the probability of a successful double-spend based on the number of confirmations a transaction has and the percent of the hash rate controlled by an attacker.

I wouldn't say it directly helps the adoption of Bitcoin. I'm just countering the notion that saving currency is a bad thing.
The more money that people save, the less money that there is out there chasing goods and services. This increases the purchasing power of that money. In effect, saving 1 BTC is similar to lending 1 BTC of value to the entire BTC economy.

There are drawbacks to p2pool. You are required to run a full node which adds costs to your mining operation (not significant, but it's something). Additionally, the variance for p2pool mining is much greater than a normal pool because minimum share difficulty is necessarily much larger than what centralized pools use.

Yeah, the details are still fuzzy. I haven't spent much time working it out.
Perhaps this project will be able to provide for the identity/reputation: 
Maybe it would cost 0.5 mBTC to make an edit request and the 0.5 mBTC goes to a spam-prevention fund owned by the block chain itself. Once enough trusted members review and approve the request, it gets committed to the article and the editor gets their 0.5 mBTC back from the fund.
All edits that are rejected as spam would add up to a growing pool of money owned by the block chain, and could be used to pay bonuses to quality content writers. Then rather than donating money to Wikipedia to fill out paperwork and maintain office space, charitable people could donate to this fund.
Just some ideas :)

It is a trustless exchange, because you can buy and sell these assets on a P2P exchange with no middlemen like Gox, Bitstamp, NYSE, etc.
The assets themselves are still trust-based, however. There isn't really a way to get around that. In order to put physical items (gold, dollars, etc.) into the computer requires someone to collect, hold, and distribute those assets. This carries with it a counterparty risk.

I'm not dismissing. I'm asking questions ;)
I've already come up with some answers to these questions, but I want to hear what other people have to say about their own proposal.
I'm also not entirely against the concept of using pull over push payments. If it's easier and you can build a safe-enough trust network for it, then maybe there's a market for it. The cool part is that we can build pull payments on top of the Bitcoin push network, and reversible escrow on top of the Bitcoin irreversible network. Going the other way around, not so much ;)

Hey, you.

An exchange consists of an order book of "bids" and "asks" which are offers to buy and to sell an asset (BTC in this case). The highest bid is always slightly lower than the lowest ask. If you place a bid higher than or equal to the lowest ask, your order will be filled by that ask, and if you place an ask lower than or equal to the highest bid, your order will be filled by that bid.
The whale placed one large ask order to sell a bunch of bitcoins. He placed it at a certain price, though, so that his order would not immediately be filled by bids. So his ask is just sitting on the exchange waiting for people to fill it.
If he were to move his ask price down low enough to be filled instantly, it would temporarily lower the price considerably. The market would likely react quickly and buy up the cheap coins, though.

To clarify, an address that starts with a 3 is not *necessarily* multisig. Bitcoin has its own Script language for transactions, which allows a range of possible "address" types requiring different conditions to be spent. The most common type is Pay-To-Pubkey-Hash (P2PKH) and each of these payment types can be expressed as a version 1 address (The ones that start with 1).
Later on, another element was added to this Script language in BIP 16 which allowed the script conditions to instead be kept secret until the coins were reclaimed, rather than the conditions being revealed as soon as the coins are sent/requested. There is a standard Script for this called Pay-To-Script-Hash (P2SH), and any one of these can be translated into a different Bitcoin address version which results in the address starting with a 3.
The most common use for P2SH addresses is to use multisignature without having to include all the different public keys in the Bitcoin address. You could use a P2SH address for basically any type of Bitcoin transaction script, though.

Mining consists only of performing SHA-256^2 on an 80-byte block header. The header consists of the version number, hashPrevBlock, hashMerkleRoot, time, bits, and nonce.
The pool, with Stratum protocol, only gives the miner these values and a range of nonces in which to work. When the miner finds a block or share that meets the minimum difficulty, they send back their results and the pool verifies at that point that the miner was working on the correct data.
It works.

No problem. If you'd like more information, feel free to ask me. I'm fairly familiar in the area of mining pools ;)
To expand on the answer, pools usually report a hash rate on their website based on the rate of shares being submitted by the miners of that pool. They could easily change the page to say something like ActualHashrate*1.5.
However, most pools also publicize which blocks they mine by adding a small message in the coinbase transaction such as "Mined by Pool  that anyone can check. If the pool is consistently mining far more or far less blocks than expected from their published hash rate, you can begin to assume something fishy is going on.

Hey Matt! You got me to start watching Bloomberg, and I'm now a big fan of the channel and yourself. Keep up the great work.
I think the initial movement of bitcoin from ~$450 to ~$600 was not caused by any specific event. The price broke the previous downtrend during that month of relative stability at $450. Bitcoin tends to move a good distance past the "appropriate" level, and so traders brought the price back up to a more appropriate level once the downtrend was broken.
Additionally, there had been a lot of good news culminating during the downtrend. BitPay broke the $100,000,000 milestone, Overstock announced continued success, small merchant adoption grew, a few large payment processors added Bitcoin as a payment option which added thousands of merchants that we don't even all know about yet, Coinbase shook hands with Budweiser for a concert series, and much, much more.
As the correction up from $450 to $600 started to slow down, more great news pushed it up to $650 and might carry it further. These recent events were DISH's announcement that they will accept Bitcoin in Q3, Apple (partially confirmed, I'm still a little doubtful) loosening up on Bitcoin apps, the eBay CEO's interview where he happily said that he owns some BTC and that eBay/PayPal would need to integrate digital currencies (no date given) in the future, and most recently the news from the ECB of negative interest rates in an attempt to increase inflation.
Seriously, though. Great work on Bloomberg. It's nice to have someone on there speaking their mind rather than reading from a prompt.

Memorizing your random-word seed is not necessary for most people. It's a cool way to move funds through a border without having any evidence of it with you, for example.
For most use cases, you can just write down that random-word seed on a piece of paper and put it in the safe.

No, there's no such thing as limbo land. All your coins are still claimable at your original address unless the transaction gets in the block chain. You can just create a new transaction (a double spend) and propagate that one instead.

If you're thinking of things like paying for drinks at a bar, food at a restaurant, or gas at a gas station, you need not worry. For small and in-person transactions such as these, you can accept zero-confirmation transactions because the likelihood of a person committing a double-spend on small transactions when their identity is known (license plate, face, etc.) and they can be prosecuted is quite small. Compare it to restaurants accepting personal checks that can bounce and credit cards that could be disputed and charged back several months later.

* Currency exchanges
* Anonymous marketplaces
* Large transactions (a house, car, etc)

From what I've read so far (not too much), this seems like a good competitor for being one of the successful second-layer protocols on top of Bitcoin. The proof-of-burn was a fair distribution mechanism and it doesn't require its own block chain. I've been waiting for P2P insurance, smart property, markets, etc. and this seems to make some of those possible.

Increasing P2Pool's hash rate will decrease the variance for the pool as a whole, but because the share difficulty for P2Pool is based on the hash rate of the pool (target rate is 1 global share per ~~30~~ **10** seconds), it also increases the variance per miner of the pool.
The net effect is 0.
Adding to P2Pool's hash rate does not decrease the net variance for each P2Pool miner.

It does not go back to the miners (except the small transaction fee). The coins are sent to [1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr]( which has been created as a valid address to which a private key is not known. In effect, bitcoins sent there are lost forever. This doesn't mean their value goes away, it's just that there are then slightly less BTC, so all other BTC slightly increase in value.

P2Pool has drawbacks and there are reasons to not do this.
P2Pool has its own chain that basically finds a block every 30 seconds. It does not decrease variance nearly as much as a normal pool, and it would be nearly impossible for most small miners to find even one share.
Also, with the faster block time, there are a lot more stale shares. This is bad as it leads to a series of strange incentives that do not work very well. Propagation becomes more important and block sizes are more likely to be limited.
And there would be nothing stopping pools from continuing to do what they do with P2Pool in place. GHash and the rest would only be mining shares on P2Pool and sharing the profits with their miners rather than mining only blocks and sharing the profits with their miners.
If a pool got 50%+ of the network hash rate, it could do the same exact attack on the P2Pool chain as it could on the main Bitcoin block chain.
Making P2Pool mandatory solves nothing and creates problems of its own.
No thank you.

I like you, and if I didn't consider voting to possibly imply consent (and lived within the arbitrary borders you are running in) I would probably vote for you.
I'm curious, though, what you would vote for when it comes time to make a decision. Would you be willing to approve pro-net-neutrality regulation that effectively limits the rights of a business to choose what services they offer?
I too believe the free-flow of information is important to a population. I'll be the first one to advocate for free information, and I practically live on the Internet. I also think healthcare, defense, and roads are important for a population (as I assume you do), but I am not willing to advocate for a system that builds these things with theft (taxes) and the infringement of other people's rights.
If you are going to draw a line that puts net neutrality in this pool of too-important-to-not-regulate/steal/impose, where do you draw the line?
Please don't interpret any of this in a negative way, I am only genuinely trying to understand this inconsistency of forced net neutrality which contrasts quite strongly with other libertarian ideals.
Also, good luck with the campaign! I'm not going to participate in politics in any way, but good on you for being quite a bit better than the competition.
Edit: LGBT rights is a similar issue in the possible approaches. Would it be better for the state to involve itself with homosexual (etc.) marriage, or for the state to remove itself entirely from all types of marriage?

What is your solution to net neutrality if you believe in voluntarism?
I see two main options:
* Remove the state-granted local monopolies and remove artificial barriers to entry in the market, leaving the market to decide whether net neutrality is valuable
* Leave the state-granted monopolies and add even further state intervention to regulate what the communications providers can and cannot do

No chargebacks? Second-layer payment processors with multisignature transactions.


I personally doubt that Satoshi would intentionally cause harm to the Bitcoin ecosystem, but it is possible. It is a potential one-time problem. He would have the ability to greatly depress the value of a bitcoin. The good thing is that this is not a systematic risk. He can spend his coins only once. This is much better than fiat systems where the government can just keep on printing.

Is it feasible to occasionally feed work with a known solution to a previous block to miners? If they don't report the block, you can shadow ban them. Of course, they could set their miners to report from many different IP addresses in order to limit your ability to ban them, but I think such a tactic would be very effective in limiting their damage.
Edit: I suppose they could also rewrite their miner to check for and report solutions to previous blocks. You *could* still feed the solution to any block your pool mines to the rest of the miners immediately before reporting the block to the network. This would increase orphan chances, though. Pools are fun.

1. I don't see what's funny about your snarky "voluntary company = government" jokes. There *is* a difference between forced participation and voluntary options. Why are you ignoring this?
2. Please provide a reasonable background for this ridiculous example. Why does Bill not have a defense company? What has he done all his life? Where are his friends and family?


Are you familiar with contractual law? Contracts have termination clauses. If a private defense company (don't call them corporations, because a corporation is a state-sanctioned entity that frees the owners of liability and puts that liability on the public against their will, and would not exist as they do in anarcho-capitalism) made a contractual offer for clients that included some bonus for a lifetime agreement, then there is no problem with that. There would almost certainly be a termination clause that defines the penalty for terminating the contract. Any lifetime contract of such a nature without any exit clause would likely be thrown out by any court and the client would not be penalized for exiting the contract early.
Assuming a proper contract was set up, that offered similar defensive and economic services as the US government performs, with a similar fee structure where you pay them some percentage of your income, sales, etc. in a similar fashion to taxes, I would have no problem with it. This is, of course, assuming that the business is merely offering a contract which people can either agree to or refuse. That is the difference. Voluntary acceptance and forced participation. Two different things.


So what if they take issue with it? Again, I don't see how other people's opinions are relevant to the discussion you and I are having. What is *your* view and how do you support it?

TigerDirect and Overstock and most other merchants can't hold BTC because none of their suppliers accept BTC.
But accepting BTC and converting to fiat is one step in the right direction. If we can get the majority of merchants and suppliers doing this, then they won't need to exchange to fiat anymore because each of their expenses could then be paid in BTC.
It's using the USD as a crutch while businesses slowly transition to accepting BTC payments. Eventually, we can drop the crutch.

You would be costing yourself ***hB/H*** for each withheld block where ***h*** is your hash rate, ***B*** is the block reward, and ***H*** is GHash.io's total hash rate.
You would be costing everyone else on the pool a total of ***B(1 - h/H)*** for each block.
For example, if you make up 1% of the pool's hash rate, you would be costing yourself 0.25 BTC to cost the rest of the pool 24.75 BTC per block.
Edit: It gets a little more complicated if you want to consider difficulty retargetting, but we'll consider that negligible.

I'm not very familiar with PETA. Do they have any proof that they actually own hardware? I'm asking because I've been suspicious of cloud mining companies being likely ponzi schemes. It's as simple as raising investments and paying out dividends less than the investments while saying that the dividends come from mining.
I don't want to falsely accuse PETA, and I'm making no such accusation. However, it does raise a flag that they unexplainably decide to not mine on P2Pool which would have been proof that they do own real hashrate.
Again, I'm not familiar with PETA specifically. Maybe they already proved ownership of hardware and I don't know about it. My inquiry still stands for any cloud mining operations that have not proved an actual hardware investment.

Those who pay taxes to fund public schools generally end up passing the cost back onto the same people from benefiting public schools. If Walmart is paying taxes, they don't just pull the money out of a hat. They raise their prices to compensate for the added cost, and the poor people end up paying for it anyways. Or they'll hire less employees, leaving even more unemployed parents that can't support their own children. Etc, etc. The cost of taxation isn't just "on the rich." It comes right back to bite the very people you try to help.

No problem.
P2Pool has a share chain similar to the Bitcoin block chain. The minimum share difficulty is adjusted so that one share is found every 30 seconds. When a share is found that meets the main Bitcoin difficulty requirement, it rewards a 0.5% subsidy to the miner that found it and the other 99.5% of the block reward is evenly distributed to each miner of the last 8640 shares.
In effect, mining on P2Pool is almost exactly like solo mining, but blocks are found every 30 seconds instead of every 10 minutes and the block reward is a share which gives you a chance of getting a payout.
since the p2pool difficulty is so much lower than bitcoin's
It is still quite high.
The P2Pool share difficulty is currently 1,592,413. Compared to Bitcoin's difficulty of 11,756,551,917, that seems pretty good, but most pools are awarding shares for difficulties more in the region of 1 to 1024.
And this only gets worse when you add hash rate to P2Pool. The difficulty retargetting algorithm would make it even harder to find a share.
If you are a small miner who barely finds any shares, adding hash rate to P2Pool would increase your variance as you will find less shares. If you are a large miner, it will slightly decrease your variance as you will still be finding a reasonable amount of shares and each share will be more likely to be rewarded.
Very few miners are large enough to be able to benefit (and the benefit would be small) from adding hash rate to P2Pool, and it would be even less so if P2Pool were a significant (20% or so) portion of the total network.

Getting back and forth between fiat and BTC isn't the point of BTC. Once you're in the system, it's fucking amazing. I'm paid for a part-time software development job by a company on the other side of the planet. They pay me in bitcoins. Fees? About 5 to 10 cents per paycheck. Involvement of third parties? Nope. I then go and spend those bitcoins at businesses that accept BTC. Fees? About 5 to 10 cents per transaction. Involvement of third parties? Nope.
The reason exchanging between fiat and BTC is expensive is because fiat sucks. It's hard to move around. It is expensive to secure. The banking system around it is horse shit.


This is being done. Hardware wallets are being developed. Paper wallets are getting easier to make. The company I'm working for is implementing multi-signature wallets.

If you trust a central source (Bitcoin Foundation? Blockchain.info? Signed Bittorrent file?), then you can trust their record of everything that happened up to block number X. Everything up to X will be pruned, and you don't have to store it. You can then continue building your block chain up the normal way from that point.
If you don't want to trust anyone, however, you will need to download the entire block chain from multiple nodes the usual way in the Bitcoin P2P network.
Another issue is that if most nodes switch to pruned chains, it would mean that anyone trying to download the entire block chain has a much smaller number of nodes that are available to seed the full chain.

I can't speak for all of libertarianism, but I certainly don't think markets are inherently "good" or any crap like that. The reason I like markets is because they do work for the betterment of humanity. If the world changes and we reach some post-scarcity utopia, you won't find me defending markets. I'll adjust my views accordingly.


Correlation does not imply causation. Do the most capitalistic areas with closely held property rights also happen to be the happiest?

It's pretty much impossible to prevent somebody from copying a computer file on a software level, and Bitcoin most certainly does nothing to help that situation.


You can do that though.

My main concern was their planned source of revenue. One of the listed major sources was profit from Euro-denominated accounts, because they would hold Bitcoin instead of Euros and expected to gain profit when the price of Bitcoin went up.
That's just a gamble on the Bitcoin price. They should have hedged themselves against that and profited from the fees of providing the service.
Though I don't think they even got to this point anyways, as there weren't really any customers yet.

Punishing individuals with a high hash rate is beyond difficult.
Users could simply divide up their hashing power into multiple miners. This is the same reason you can't add anything to the protocol that punishes larger pools. They could simply report to the block chain as two separate pools.

It still gives them risk to let you choose how you want to be refunded.
* Buy large $10,000 item for 10 BTC when 1 BTC is worth $1,000
* BTC price increases to $10,000 per BTC
* Cancel order, ask for 10 BTC back
Overstock would have to buy back 10 BTC for $100,000 when originally they only got $10,000 from it.
That's a loss of $90,000 for them, without gaining anything. And if you say that they keep 10% of their BTC in BTC, they still end up losing on the other 90% that they do convert.
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:02:02
I went for BTC because:
* Much lower fees, less hassle (employer is on the other side of the globe)
* I believed it would appreciate in value (it has, I'm doing well) and believe it will continue to appreciate
* I wanted to be able to say that I'm paid in Bitcoin. It's a pretty small group at the moment, and I feel like a pioneer :D
My day to day purchases are limited. I'm a college student living the broke college student life, while accumulating a stash of bitcoins.

For new users without any starting connections, I think it would be easy to select a few starting trusted identities. For example, you could list the developers of your client as trusted. There might be reputable merchants with brand recognition outside of this decentralized market that you could list as trusted.
As a side note, I also think it would be important to have different degrees of trust you can assign to an identity. For example, you would be able to list your close friends as highly trusted, and you could list a merchant you bought from 1 time as lightly trusted. This would complicate the calculations for feedback weighting some, but all of that would be handled under-the-hood by the client.

Because of the small size, most of the transactions only go to individual miners. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this would require the recipient to be the one that mines the block. P2Pool nodes aren't set up to process zero-fee transactions for everyone else mining on P2Pool, that I'm aware of.
Also, the wallet I'm using has a minimum transaction fee of 0.0001.
I think what I will do is batch transactions together in groups of 10 to cut the per-transaction fee to 0.00001. You will still be able to send an instant/individual tip using the 'instant' keyword in the comment. I'll announce when this is ready, along with a couple other updates and a release of the source code.

Data is stored in packets, a bit like how Bitcoin data is stored in transactions. Each packet contains information such as "Email a is the same person as reddit.comand a cryptographic signature from the person who created the packet. It could also say something like "I give a 9/10 rating for store Example
These packets get passed around and stored by Identifi nodes. A block chain is not needed because consensus and chronological ordering of packets is not critical. With a financial ledger, it is critical. If you just see 8 out of 10 reviews that were made for an OpenBazaar merchant, it doesn't matter so much.
Nodes transmit and store packets with their peers. Nodes may limit/reject packets signed by identities with little/no reputation in the web of trust.

MySpace, Blackberry, and Internet Explorer are products operated by individual businesses. Bitcoin is a protocol. What replaced TCP/IP? Well, nothing really. What replaced SMTP? I guess we're still using SMTP. I'm not saying Bitcoin is guaranteed to be the primary cryptocurrency, but it's a lot more likely than the author portrayed.
Good article other than that, though.

Most of the people over at myself included, are not proposing a sudden abolition of governments. Of course if you get rid of the entity providing (albeit, very poorly) things like education, fire departments, and police there will be a sudden lack in such things. That would be bad.
We propose a transition. Go through a process where you start by cutting out all of the bullshit (foreign wars, drug war, etc.) first and then give the market time to respond to demands as you slowly phase out the actual services it is providing.

Your solution didn't solve anything. You leave OP with two choices:
1. Use your method, but don't give anyone access to the file.
2. Use your method, and sell access to the file to customers.
* Result 1: Nobody has access to the file. The art cannot be shared or sold. Nobody wins.
* Result 2: Anyone with access to the file can duplicate the file and share it with anyone. If more than one person was given access to the file, the artist would have no idea who was the one that duplicated and released the file.
Result 1 is completely pointless for an artist. They could just skip the cryptography and just keep the file on their own hard drive without ever sharing it.
Result 2 doesn't accomplish any level of restricting duplication of the file. There is no added benefit.
I'm done hand-holding you through the pointlessness of your suggestion. If you think it actually accomplishes anything, go make it.

You are incorrect in saying Bitcoin will *always* be inflationary, by both definitions of inflation.
The rate of increase in total BTC starts at 50 BTC/block and is halved every 210,000 blocks, rounding down to the nearest satoshi. At block  which in theory should happen around the year 2140, we'll be at a rate of 0 BTC/block. This is when the inflation (by the definition of an increase in the monetary base) stops, and the total BTC supply is fixed at 20,999,999.9769 BTC.
Bitcoins are and will always be occasionally "lost" when their associated private keys are lost. Some bitcoins are actually purposefully deleted as a "proof of burn" for things like the [CounterParty]( protocol. These lost coins lower the total supply of bitcoins in practice, which is deflation by the definition of a lowering of the total money supply.
The other definition of deflation, as a net increase in the purchasing power per unit of a currency, has been the general trend for Bitcoin since its inception because the Bitcoin economy is growing much more rapidly than the supply of BTC. This deflation will likely decrease as Bitcoin approaches total market saturation, but it will continue at a minimal rate as the global economy grows and technology makes goods and services naturally more inexpensive.


I concur. A small amount of *natural* deflation in a sound money is not a problem.

Are you familiar with altcoins?
It started with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a single unique network.
People started to copy the code base of Bitcoin, tweak some settings, and launch a new network with its own coin. (See: Namecoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin)
One of the main settings for a cryptocurrency is the mining algorithm. Bitcoin uses SHA256^(2). Lots of other coins switched to different algorithms such as Scrypt. Any coin that uses SHA256^(2) can be mined with Bitcoin mining equipment.
The main difference between those coins and Bitcoin is that they don't have much of a network effect behind them. People don't use them because people don't accept them because people don't use them because people don't accept them...

No. You get paid out when you find a share on the P2Pool share chain (there is 1 global share per 30 seconds, good luck) *and* the pool finds a block while your share is still valid.

My favorite solution for instant confirmations at the moment is multisignature green addresses.
The problem with 0-confirmation transactions it that the sender could sign a second transaction to double-spend the coins. However, if the transactions from green addresses also required the signature by a trusted centralized entity that never signs a double spend transaction, you don't really need to wait for block confirmations.
I realize that it is not ideal to trust centralized entities, but this would only be an optional feature. If a merchant doesn't want to trust green addresses, they can just wait for the confirmations like any other address. Additionally, you could increase the splitting of the keys so that, for example, 3 different trusted entities need to sign off on a green address's transactions. That would spread out the trust and add a little bit of decentralization.
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:08:03
Without a transaction fee, the transactions would not be relayed by most nodes and would not be included in blocks by most miners.

I think something around the order of $1M (in today's USD) per Bitcoin is an optimistic upper bound for a BTC for the next couple of decades. That leaves a satoshi at $0.01.

When you create a transaction, that transaction has inputs and outputs. The inputs are claims to previous transactions that were sent to the address you are sending from. When you add up the total number of BTC from each input, that is how many BTC you are able to spend in the transaction. If you try to spend any more, computers/nodes/miners will very easily be able to see that your numbers do not add up and your transaction is ignored.

A very small group of people already hold a very large share of the world's total wealth. So I don't think the condition there would be much worse.
The good part is that with Bitcoin, the playing field is level. If you're wealthy in Bitcoin, you still have to play by the same rules as everyone else. Nobody can print bitcoins out of thin air. Anyone is allowed to participate in the mining process, and everyone has to mine the same algorithm.
In the current system, a very select group of individuals control the printing of money. They don't play by the same rules as everyone else.
Feel free to disagree, but the way I see it is that the current monetary system started out with fairly decentralized wealth but concentrated that wealth in the hands of a few. Bitcoin on the other hand may start out with concentrated wealth, but the level playing field will in time decentralize the wealth.
@_date: 2014-04-05 21:43:53
This is the correct answer.
You can't stop someone from replicating a file, but you could use a sort of colored coin in to show authorized ownership of a copy.
It would be the equivalent of an artist creating 1000 signed paintings, where the signatures are verifiable and cannot be forged. But while you can verify the signatures, you can't stop someone from duplicating the painting itself.
Hope that helps.

I'm not sure how Eligius supposedly did it, but one possibility is as follows:
1. Take the information for a previously solved block
2. Send that information along with a range of nonces that includes the actual nonce for the previous block to the suspected miner for hashing
3. If they do not report the found block, you can assume they are withholding blocks
One point somebody just brought up to me is that some mining hardware does not check every nonce, so there is a chance that an honest miner would also not report the found block. I'm guessing you could just repeat the above process a certain number of times to guarantee reasonable confidence that the miner is withholding.

The way my employer and I do it is quite easy. I send him an invoice with a Bitcoin address and he pays it.
If you're going to be using ACH to send the payment to the employee, you're not paying bitcoins to the employee. I guess the easy way would be to set up a Coinbase account for payroll and deposit as needed to keep it funded. When it comes time to pay the employee, purchase the bitcoins and send to his address. The better way would be to accept Bitcoin as a payment method, hold (some of) those coins in a company wallet, and use them to pay employees.

I could practice a bit more empathy at times, you're not wrong on that. I'm pretty sure we all could.
And I didn't mean to accuse each individual parent of wrongdoing; there are always exceptions, and critiques should only be made to the extent of the details supporting them.
It does seem likely, though, that many of the parents of these kids *are* partially at fault for poor parenting, and that they are subconsciously looking for anyone or anything (those damn inanimate drugs) to blame rather than themselves.

Yeah, there are legitimate possibilities for a cloud mining contract. Pool operators could use it to pay for an initial boost in their pool's hash rate in order to overcome the chicken-and-egg problem of making a viable pool. Miners could use it to remove the uncertainty over difficulty adjustments and focus on the efficiency of their equipment. I'm sure there are other possibilities.
The problem is that right now the markets for this are very thin, and so it is rare to find any reasonably priced contracts.

Not really.
One possibility is that there weren't any transactions to add. It was mined ~27 seconds after the previous one. Another possibility is intentionally not including transactions in order to minimize propagation times for the block and thus minimize the risk of on orphan.
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:51:49
Completely unrelated.
Proof of existence is awesome. It allows you to prove that some file (a signed contract, a song, etc.) existed at a certain point in time, without revealing the contents of the file at that time. To do this, you create a special transaction that contains the hash of the file. Then in the future when you want to prove that the file existed, you can release the file contents, anyone can get the same hash as you did, and you point them to the block chain and the timestamp of the transaction's block.
This has nothing to do with preventing people from copy/pasting files, though.

fiat currency (n.): Fiat money is money which derives its value from government regulation or law

$12 -&gt; $1200 in one year is +990% annual change.
Historic inflation of [some government-backed currencies:](
* China (1949): 5,070%
* Germany (1923): 29,525%
* Greece (1944): 13,800%
* Hungary (1946): 41,900,000,000,000,000,000%
* Peru (1990): 397%
* Republika Srpska (1994): 297,000,000%
* Zimbabwe (2008): 7,960,000,000%
But hey, anything backed by a government is obviously golden. Right? Right?


There are these amazing wallets such as Bitcoin-QT, Electrum, blockchain.info, bitalo.com, Schildbach's wallet, Mycelium, etc. where no company can run off with or lose your money. You own your coins, and no company can run off with them.

There would likely not be intellectual property rights. As you know, they are practically impossible to enforce even *with* government intervention. Further, they grant an unhealthy monopoly to businesses that are then allowed to charge outrageous amounts for years without competition from generics.


Why does Google develop the open-source Android operating system? Because they are, in a way, the "first movers" in the Android project. People are willing to use Google's official versions because they trust Google.
If I have cancer, and Company A develops a cure for it and is offering the cure for $5,000, I'm not going to wait for Company B to reverse engineer it. Nor am I going to be willing to trust Company B to perform surgery / create a drug that is reverse engineered, even if they do reduce the price to $2,500. But you know what? Some people don't have $5,000, and they *would* pay Company B $2,500 for the off-brand treatment. With patents, that isn't possible. Company B would not be allowed to give the treatment, and poor people would literally die unnecessarily from cancer.
Secondly, much of the research isn't performed for profit but for recognition and personal ambition. Universities do research to build their reputation and pique the interest of future students. Students do research to get their degree.
Finally, if some research absolutely requires significant funding (let's pretend we could put the price tag of $1T on a cancer cure), you can imagine that would become a prime target for charitable donations. If you free up 50% of people's income that was previously taxed, they have a lot more money to donate.

P2Pool isn't "built into the software" really, but it is a great piece of software. Another benefit is that anyone running P2Pool is also running a full Bitcoin node. It has issues of its own, though. For one, it has its own block chain with its own idea of a difficulty to submit shares to the P2Pool network. If everyone was using P2Pool, it wouldn't decrease variance that much for small miners. Latency also doesn't scale that well with P2Pool.

BTC-e issues proper transactions with their BTC withdrawals, so the transactions go through.

Split your keys in better ways to spread out the trust and prevent anyone but you from completing a transaction.
For example, use 3-of-5 addresses. Keep 2 of the keys locked up in your safe, 1 on your main wallet device (phone or PC), 1 by a trusted service provider such as blockchain.info (They don't have this implemented yet, just an example), and 1 by Coinbase.com. Whenever you sign a transaction from your main wallet, both Coinbase and Blockchain.info will use 2FA to confirm with you before signing off on the transaction.
With that set-up, you can always recover your coins even if Coinbase and Blockchain.info lose or run away with yours. Additionally, Coinbase and Blockchain.info cannot steal your coins even if both of them cooperated.
Add in more keys and backup mechanisms to taste.

Bitcoin can replace checks, depositing and withdrawing cash, wire transfers, and quite a bit more.

One of the most interesting possibilities to me is instant confirmations from multisignature addresses if merchants trust one/some of the key holders to never sign a double spend.
For example, if a customer had a 3-of-3 address where Coinbase and Blockchain.info each own one of the keys and agree to never sign a double spend, merchants that trust Coinbase or Blockchain.info could consider transactions from that address as instantly confirmed.
You could also change the signing policies to introduce consumer protection.

What do you mean by normal users?
If it takes 15 seconds to propagate even to the first 50% of the miners, that is 15 seconds that the entire network will be spending towards orphaning your block. Do you know of any paper that analyzes this mathematically? Meni Rosenfeld has a nice paper on pools, but it doesn't cover the effect of block size on propagation / reward.

@_date: 2015-05-11 00:27:09
It's about the time required to propagate your block through the network. Bigger block = slow propagation.
It has nothing to do with the mining/hashing process.

Use the hash rate calculated from the P2Pool share chain, not the number of blocks found. There's much much less variance with the shares than the blocks (that's the point).
Looking at that, no. There hasn't been any significant change in the hash rate over the last week.

It is of course bad for privacy reasons, if you intend to be private. That obviously doesn't apply here. You, I, and Apache all want transparency for Apache donations.
It is sometimes bad for security reasons. Although rarely an issue, it is one necessary ingredient in what can sometimes be a dangerous combination. If you recall the Android wallet bug some months ago which left some wallets vulnerable (and robbed if I remember correctly), that would not have resulted in as severe of an issue were the wallets not reusing addresses.
Address reuse is also more of a hack that just happens to work than an intended part of the protocol. Addresses were many as one-time payment destinations, each given a label in your wallet as one transaction recipient. Addresses were not intended to be used like wallets themselves and considered to have a "balance."
To remain transparent, Apache could generate a new address for each page refresh and add it to some list they keep public. Anyone could verify that their given donation address is added to this list. Simple. Solved. No address reuse.

There are multiple proposed solutions, and not a whole lot of consensus on which ones to implement yet.
Some of the solutions include using "local" block chains that build up transactions and then square up with the real thing every so often with large transactions, just increasing the block size limit (it's an artificial limit to prevent spamming), and moving smaller transactions off-chain using payment processors such as Coinbase.
It's definitely not a fully solved issue, though.

The speed is limited by a self-imposed block size limit. Transactions have a size, blocks have the size limit, and we only get 1 block every ~10 minutes.
To increase this, we need to increase the block size limit. The limit is there mostly to prevent spam, but going higher also means more storage space is required to store the block chain.

Agreed. There are already "lite" wallets, mainly for mobile devices.

There's always plausible deniability. For all the shop owner knows, you could be using a service with shared wallets (e.g. Coinbase? Not sure if they do this). Perhaps this service pays from the shared wallet and deducts from your balance on their own internal ledger.
Note: This is one reason that **"FROM ADDRESSES" ARE NOT A THING**.
To add more plausible deniability, you should never reuse addresses. If your change is always being sent to a new address, how can the shop owner differentiate between your payments and your change? How can they differentiate between your change and your income?
To add even more plausible deniability, you can use methods such as CoinJoin to mix your inputs and outputs with other people's inputs and outputs in a single transaction. With this, how could the shop owner differentiate between your money and a pseudonymous stranger's money? How could the shop owner differentiate between your change and their change?

You're talking about the price of BTC, not Bitcoin itself.
There are many factors in the price of BTC. I'm not particularly interested in that, but generally the price of a BTC is proportional to the value of the network as a whole divided by the number of BTC. The value of the network as a whole is roughly proportional to the square of the number of users ([Metcalfe's law](

You can generate N private/public key pairs on separate devices, and have them share only the public keys with a single device. That device can use those public keys to create a M-of-N multisignature address.

I'm not a proponent, but playing devil's advocate... Fees. Less transactions, but higher fees per transaction.

Everything said is correct.
Address reuse was never intended in the protocol. Many Bitcoin users are treating an *address* as if it were an *identity* but they should be treating them as *transactions*. So you shouldn't use the address as being "Employer", but rather you should use it as "Invoice 014".
You don't really have to worry about why it's like this, unless you're genuinely interested in how the protocol works. Just know that you shouldn't reuse addresses ;)

@_date: 2015-05-06 03:03:23
Immediately, it wouldn't have much effect either way.
In the long run, it would likely increase decentralization by allowing more transactions to happen on the block chain itself rather than through third-party clearing houses.
There are probably also some implications on the decentralization of mining. Off the top of my head, a larger block chain might make it *slightly* more expensive to solo mine. It would be cheaper for pools to be sharing a single full node with the miners. 
Actually, it would make it slightly more expensive for anyone to run a full node. Less nodes would increase centralization a bit, but I doubt the cost would outweigh the benefits.
There's some size at which the cost does start to outweigh the possible benefit, but that's basically impossible to determine. Another thought is that miners would not be incentivized to make blocks of a size anywhere near that point, because larger blocks take more time to propagate and thus have a higher chance of being orphaned.

What is this huge portion? While XT might not have anywhere near what I would call consensus support, a block size increase certainly does.

I'll admit that "challenging to perfectly describe" was an extreme understatement, but I'd like to think it's possible to describe and translate the consensus protocol. It would be a great exercise in discovering previously unknown quirks such as the one fixed on BIP 42.
I would be happy to contribute to such an endeavor. The idea of relying on an imperfectly documented consensus library for Bitcoin is a bit unsettling to me.

How do you define economic consensus?
If 99.9% of users, miners, merchants, developers, etc. agreed to switch to XT and only 0.1% preferred to keep the original protocol, would XT still be an altcoin? How about everyone in the world except you? How about 51%? Where do you draw the line, and how?
If I decided to start up a node and mine the pre-0.8.1 chain, would that mean that not "everyone" chooses to abandon the old chain? Wouldn't what you're labeling as Bitcoin need to be considered an altcoin, since there isn't absolute consensus?
Also, how do you define "Bitcoin codebase"? Is  == "Bitcoin codebase"? Does it include other implementations? Just the consensus parts?

~~From the last list I remember, GA.it was one of the few businesses/wallets opposed to a block size increase. Kudos to you for standing your ground.~~
I'm still undecided on my personal support/opposition of an increased block size. This is why I'm trying to engage people such as yourself and luke-jr to understand your perspective, as well as possibly challenge some of your assertions ("XT is an altcoin", etc). If you can formulate substantial responses to my questions, then your argument is strengthened and the debate moves forward. If you can't, then maybe you should amend your argument. Again, progress is made.
I agree that we should strive for a high level of consensus before making such important changes. The 75% threshold for BIP 101 is lower than I would like. It's obviously lower than what you and luke-jr would like.
My main question right now seems to be something along the lines of this: How would *you* define the criteria for consensus?
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:13:37
It will likely be resolved before it even happens.
Assume you're a miner. It's late December, 2015, and 82% of all mined blocks in the last week have a vote for the XT fork. Are you going to keep running the non-XT fork, when it's nearly certain that your fork will not prevail and all of your income after the fork will be practically worthless? Or will you concede, switch to XT before the fork, and continue to generate revenue during and after the fork?
Of course, it's also possible that in late December, we're at only 10% support for XT. If you're a miner, would you continue running an XT client? Or would you concede that the XT fork is destined for failure, and switch back to the non-XT fork?

I don't understand. This has nothing to do with losing the physical coin.
* Alice mints a physical coin.
* Bob purchase the coin from Alice.
* Bob gives the coin to Carol.
* Carol gives the coin to Dave.
* Dave gives the coin to Eve.
* Eve breaks the coin's security mechanisms to determine the private key without damaging the physical coin in any way.
* Eve gives the coin to Frank.
* Frank gives the coin to Gary.
* Eve uses the private key to redeem the bitcoins.
* Frank now has an empty physical coin, and has no way of knowing who redeemed the bitcoins.
It could have been any previous owner. That's not a secure system at all. It's just playing hot potato, and every person that touches it has a financial incentive to redeem the bitcoins after passing the coin off to the next owner. It becomes a system of trust in a sense completely opposite to the principles of Bitcoin.

Can confirm. Big companies move slowly because their software systems are massive and their development process is rigorous. Adding a "small" feature like this means something like finding the team(s) that own this part, fully defining the specification, developing a prototype, testing the prototype to not interfere with other features, running a user experience survey, developing an actual implementation, getting design feedback from a design team, reworking the design, testing again, more testing, then sending a request to another team to add the new implementation.
Something like that. And it's expensive.

"Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard."
Altcoins can get a network effect, too. I'm still very certain that Bitcoin will come out on top, but if an altcoin were to facilitate a large amount of genuine payments that Bitcoin's bottleneck can't, it would only be a matter of time before the altcoin's hard work beats Bitcoin's talent.

That's a great point that is often overlooked. Inflation would eventually become a non-issue even with fixed bock rewards.
The main problem here is that we signed up for Bitcoin given it's current supply schedule. Keeping the supply schedule the same as the original is far more important to me than what the supply schedule actually is (as long as the original wasn't something absurd, like 500% fixed annual inflation or something).

I've been wanting a physical Bitcoin lately for the novelty, but I can't get myself to do it because they just don't make sense. It will always be possible in one way or another to secretly read the private key before passing the physical token to someone else. And with a chain of previous owners, anonymous or not, there's no way to prove if you redeem the coins. I love the novelty, but they're prime for improvable scamming.
@_date: 2015-07-19 05:34:27
It's kind-of-sort-of possible to track "where" bitcoins come from. But it's a bad idea. If you can trust me on it, please do so. If not, just ask and I'll bore you with the technicalities ;)
Wanting to mark blocks with the energy source used to power the miner also seems like an extremely niche interest. I don't want to sound discouraging, but you probably won't get any traction with that proposal. :\

I'm not taking any positions yet, but it's not quite 20x as difficult/expensive. The cost of creating and signing transactions is near 0. The main cost for spamming is the transaction fee. You'd need to consider what the new fees would be with larger blocks.
They would almost certainly be lower, and the equivalent spam cost for a 20x increase would probably be somewhere between 1x to 20x as expensive.

Public/private keys come in pairs. There is a single public key for your single private key.

I'm likely on my way out, as well, for similar reasons. I do not consider this case to be pedantic, however, and I'm sorry that you do.
People are reusing addresses, treating them like accounts, etc. This is a malpractice caused by misconceptions which are encourage by statements such as "Addresses are debited".
I don't think it is pedantic when this exact practice literally resulted in the theft of coins that would not have been stolen without address reuse. See:

A different RNG was used for key generation and for signing. The RNG used in signing was faulty, not the the RNG used in key generation. Without address reuse, the RNG used in signing would not have mattered.

I think you're missing the main point. Assuming all transactions with acceptable fees are able to be processed in each block and thus a backlog of pending transactions does not build up, then there will still be essentially 0 pending transactions and 0 transaction fees immediately after each block is solved. Without the standard block rewards, this would leave 0 incentive to mine a block. The incentive would increase linearly as pending transactions accrue. Each miner would have their point of profitability where they would presumably turn their miners back on. Most of these points would likely be in a small range.

Liquidity is slowly improving at BitMEX. Still not too deep, but it's moving in the right direction at least. Also, they've changed the margin call reference price to a mark price derived from the underlying index rather than based on the trades at BitMEX.

If you have a smartphone and are not looking to buy any more than an amount you'd feel comfortable carrying around in your wallet as cash every day, I recommend installing the [Mycelium]( wallet.
It includes an in-person market similar to localbitcoins. While I was in San Jose for the summer, I made several trades with mostly new users. My listings were more competitively priced than most others in the area, and I can't guarantee that the rest of the buyers/sellers out there will be as friendly as me, but there were quite a few listings in the area. I'm sure you could find a nice enough seller with a reasonable rate, if you are comfortable meeting a stranger at a place like a Starbucks or Jamba Juice.
If you really only want a small and easy-to-get amount to play with as a "trial", check out [Changetip]( "Top up with a Debit or Credit Card" feature. From there, you can withdraw to any other wallet you want to use. This is currently free, but it looks like there will be a 5% withdrawal fee (very high, in my opinion) beginning December 15.

I want to say my usual "If your mining profitability depends on an increase in the price of BTC, you should buy the coins up front instead of mining them."
However, this is usually directed at miners of small, medium, or even "somewhat large" scale. Purchasing $100,000,000 worth of BTC would be nearly impossible without massive slippage. Perhaps at such a scale, mining would actually be better.
Another interesting factor is that the more they spend on mining hardware, the less profitable each new dollar spent becomes. Gross mining revenue is correlated to what percent of the network hash rate you own. As your percentage grows, it becomes more difficult to increase it further.
For example, if the network is at 1,000 hashes/second, and adding hardware will cost you $1/hash/second... You could own 33% of the network for $500 (increased network now being 1,500 hashes/second). For another $500, you could own 50%. Multiplying your costs by 2 with that second $500 only multiplies your gross revenue (33% to 50%) by about 1.52.

So am I, and that's one of the most valuable principles for a person to have. Many internet points to you.


With BIP 101, 8 GB blocks wouldn't come until ~2036. By then, VISA (or some competing system) will probably have a higher transaction rate than today.
But comparing 8 GB blocks to today's VISA transaction rates:
let `visaActual2010Peak` = 11,000 tps [[source](
let `visa2014Q4Average` = 16,000,000,000 / 90 days =  2058 tps [[source](
let `visaBurstLimit` = 56,000 tps [[source](
let `transactionSize` = 250 bytes / transaction [[source](
let `blockTime` = 10 minutes = 600 seconds
let `blockSize` = 8,000,000,000 bytes [note: BIP 101 ends at 8,192,000,000 bytes]
let `bitcoinPeak` = `blockSize` / (`transactionSize` * `blockTime`)
`bitcoinPeak` = 8,000,000,000 bytes / ((250 bytes / transaction) * 600 seconds)
`bitcoinPeak` = 53,333 tps
Sorry for `visaActual2010Peak` being about 5 years old. I couldn't find anything more recent. I'm guessing it's a bit higher now, but still well below `bitcoinPeak`. As shown, the 8 GB block is just short of VISA's claimed burst capacity, which has never actually been used.

This is correct and basically kills OP's suggestion.
Another option would be to have an extra fee/byte taken out of the miner's block reward, and then distributed back to another miner in a different block reward.
If a miner wants to create a 1 TB block, they have to pay large fees for it that get distributed to later miners.
I think that's a terrible idea, but just throwing it out there.

Not sure what you imply. 50x is very high, yes, but it's up to you to pick your desired leverage anywhere from 0x to 50x. They've also got a fairly nice system for handling margin calls and covering any liquidation-induced losses with a publicly-displayed percent of trader profits.
And if you don't want to be exposed to possibly covering the losses (let's say you're hedging long term instead of trading short term) of liquidations, they have other contracts with less max leverage that are externally insured.

P2Pool does not have a high block orphan rate. When a P2Pool miner finds a block, they broadcast it to the main Bitcoin network immediately like any other miner would. With 10 minute blocks, there aren't many blocks found close enough to cause orphans.
If there is any increase, it's fairly small and due to the size of the miners relative to others. If a large pool finds a block, it has a little extra time to work on the next while it broadcasts it.
The shares have a non-negligible orphan rate, but that's due to the 30-second share time and the time it takes to broadcast shares within the pool network. But most miners in the pool will have about the same share orphan rate, so it ends up having little/no impact.
For a few examples of actual drawbacks, see my downvoted reply.

This is an excellent solution.
You can generate unlimited addresses on the server, your private key is kept offline, and the SPV client is lightweight but still doesn't allow spoofed payments.
@_date: 2015-09-06 03:20:57
If an SPV client receives block headers and hashes, it can be as certain as any full node that it's on the longest chain (unless the transactions in any block are invalid, which would be very expensive to do), right? And if it receives the full merkle chain from any relevant transaction, that's sufficient proof that it is in the block.
The vulnerabilities I see are withholding (which is no worse than with a full node), invalid blocks (which is very expensive), and reduced privacy.

@_date: 2015-09-05 20:12:45
I'm not necessarily advocating accepting Bitcoin without a full node (or at least an actual SPV client), but there are plenty of advantages outside the trustless payment receipt.
Bitcoin as a currency has a predetermined supply. Some merchants might want to accept a currency that can't be inflated at the whim of some organization.
Once a transaction is confirmed, it's practically impossible to reverse. When a credit card company says "You received a payment", they're not guaranteeing that payment won't be reversed. When a block chain explorer says " You received a payment " and then "Your payment has been confirmed" about ten minutes later, they are claiming near certainty that the transaction is permanent.
Although the adoption is still fairly low, Bitcoin is a global currency. As adoption picks up, a merchant might prefer to accept a global currency over a national one.
The list goes on, and maybe many of the points aren't that convincing. But it's not as though the other benefits of Bitcoin are actually zero.

You are correct in that basically all functionality of Bitcoin could be emulated by a single server. In fact, somewhat similar systems have existed in the past (the Liberty Reserve types). But they have their own set of vulnerabilities. A single point of failure that can censor payments, be shut down by governments, etc.

Requires a full node. Does not decrease variance as much as most centralized pools, particularly for small miners. Shares are orphaned/stale more often than with a centralized pool. It's not too bad, but a small difference can be the difference between profit and loss for low-margin miners.
@_date: 2015-09-12 13:34:24

Yeah, this is a fairly intense debate going on at the moment. It's impossible to know the exact curves for things like these. Exactly how does block size affect competition for transaction inclusion? Exactly how does competition affect the average fee?
There are other factors at play, too. Bigger blocks would make it more expensive to run a full node. Expensive full nodes would likely lead to less full nodes, decreasing the decentralization. It also has effects on latency in block propagation.
There are too many variables at play to come up with a perfect solution. Right now, everyone is trying to figure out the best solution we can agree on.
Understand that if we increase block size sufficiently, fees will remain low. If we do not, off-chain services, lightning networks, etc. will become the preferred method of using Bitcoin, and those fees will still be low.

I have no insider information, so my guess is as good as any, but...
It seems very likely that part of this rally is driven by the devaluation of the yuan and corresponding capital controls. Bitcoin is a great vehicle for getting capital out, hence larger buying on Chinese exchanges.
There is a delay in moving the fiat around (although **not** necessarily due to insolvency, as with Gox), so arbitration has a delay. Arbitration is made even more difficult / risky due to the volatility, so the spreads between exchanges widen.
It's also a bit telling that this gap can be seen between most western and Chinese exchanges. It's not just one anomalous exchange.

Greed is the reason I engineer software that makes your life easier and more enjoyable. Greed is why you don't shoot your neighbor. Greed, believe it or not, is why people donate to and volunteer for charity.
We are self-interested creatures. We want some subset of things including delicious food, luxurious housing, power, wealth, karma, and friends. Due to this "greedy" nature, we trade. Farmers trade their produce for your money. Your neighbor doesn't shoot you in exchange for not being imprisoned. Bill Gates donates to charity to feel that he makes a good impact on mankind.
Greed reciprocates to form mutually beneficial collaboration. Greed is good, and you talk out of your ass.

If I pay $3 to have a 75% chance of winning and you pay $1 to have a 25% chance of winning, we both have the same "odds". The reason a casino wins is that it can (for example) pay $0.95 to have a 50% chance of winning and you pay $1 to have a 50% chance of winning.

Each node (unless modified from the standard functionality) would prioritize the first one it receives and drop any others that it receives.

Bitcoin makes remittance cheaper because it removes the middlemen.
The startup you are referring to is essentially a Western Union clone that unnecessarily uses Bitcoin on the back end. It does not remove the middlemen.
To use Bitcoin properly for remittance, all one needs to do is send a Bitcoin payment back home. This costs a few cents, at most.
At the moment, it is likely that there is also the step of converting local currency A to bitcoins before the payment, and then the step of converting bitcoins to local currency B after the payment. As adoption increases, Bitcoin becomes more of a global currency and the conversion step (which might average about a 1% fee on each side) goes away.

If anything, address reuse makes bookkeeping harder. When you don't reuse an address, that address can serve as a sort of "invoice number" that can be linked to a payment request.
As for being transparent, there's nothing stopping you from publishing more than one address that you've used. The simplest implementation would be to keep a public list of all addresses used. When you make a new payment request, add that address.

It's probably in part because of the current volatility. You can't really expect high liquidity with tiny spreads when the rate is going up and down 10% in a day. Spreads should start to tighten up when things calm down.
Also, it really depends on the exchange. Do you know who is behind the MT4 pair you're looking at? It might be BTC-E, and while they aren't exactly small, they do have less volume and bigger spreads than some other exchanges.

Hi. mod here.
A bitcoin address does not need to be submitted to enter. It's one entry per Reddit account. While it's possible to create puppet accounts, we have enforced some account age minimum, and users tend to donate to the winner based on account activity. If you won with an inactive puppet account, you would likely not receive very much.
I agree 100% that does not function well as a lottery. That's not the point of it, though. It is more of a social experiment and a chance for those with a spare $1 to collaborate in making a positive impact on one person's life.
Also, we have had larger turnouts than "a couple hundred bucks".
So far:
1. ~$968.13
2. ~$11,400
3. ~$5190.99
These numbers may not be completely outstanding, but I think they did make the impact we hope for.
If you have any suggestions for the subreddit, we'd love to hear them.
@_date: 2015-02-04 06:57:51
Bitcoin transactions use a neat little scripting language to set the conditions required to spend outputs. Only a few types of conditions are considered "standard". Originally, it was pay-to-public-key (P2PK). Pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH) followed. Regular Bitcoin addresses (the 1xxxxx... ones) are of this type. The address contains version info, a checksum, and the public key hash. More recent are pay-to-script-hash (P2SH), where another condition script can be set without being revealed until redeemed. These are the 3xxxxx... addresses, and they're most commonly used for multisignature because you can fit a large script (involving multiple public keys) into a relatively small address by hashing the redemption script.
When people say your address is your public key, they are technically incorrect, but they are usually only trying to convey the difference between public and private. You can share your address and (probably) your public key, but you should not reveal your private key.

The price does not magically increase when the block reward is halved, because the halving is already known entirely in advance. Price changes based on new information. If it were suddenly "discovered" that there would be an extra halving tomorrow, the price would move up to reflect that.
Of course, it's entirely possible for irrational people to cause the price to go up anyways at a halving, but irrational people are already trading the price in illogical directions. There's not much you could do to stop that.

Having copies wouldn't make it any better. Once somebody has a copy of your private keys, they can use them to spend your bitcoins right away and then your private keys are worthless.


That's basically an M-of-N way to store your keys, where there are N parts to the key and M parts are required to spend the bitcoins. It's a good idea if you do it right.
Maybe you don't have a safe at home, so you want to put your paper wallet in a safety deposit box at the credit union. Well, all it would take is *one* person to be able to take a picture of your paper wallet in that *one* safety deposit box. You definitely wouldn't expect anyone to be able to do this, but why take the chance?
So you can split it up into, say, 3-of-5. You would have 5 paper wallet fragments and 3 would be required to spend your coins. Now put each fragment in a safety deposit box at a different credit union / bank. Ta da.

When you're doing mining profitability calculations, **do not factor in the exchange rate**. Do everything in terms of BTC including your hardware costs, maintenance costs, and production. This will show you the actual profitability of mining. When you factor in the exchange rate, you are throwing in an element entirely separate from mining profitability.

Aha, twisting the quote around to call Bitcoiners the ones fearing the unknown. While I commend your rhetorical strategy, I don't think it's a great analysis.
It probably does hold true for many of the tinfoil hat bearers, but they are the minority. Many Bitcoin users enjoy Bitcoin simply as a tool. They don't care about its underlying intentions. It's money, and it's good at being money.
Most of us that do care have actually done considerable research into the government and banking system. We saw that most people just accept the status quo at face value, but we acknowledged how little we really know about it. So we researched and didn't like what we found.

Hello? :o
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:20:36
Here's the thing... Bitcoin is way more than something you can just mine. I'm glad you're interested in it, but you should do some more research before trying to undergo something like mining. Mining is very competitive, and profitability will continue to drop as the difficulty rises. 
It's practically impossible to profit from mining with a CPU or GPU miner. ASICs are generally the only profitable hardware, and it's very difficult to get your hands on them. Search for Butterfly Labs and all of the problems they have had with actually shipping the hardware to customers.
Also, if you aren't completely familiar with how to use a bitcoin address, it's not a great idea to jump into bitcoin already. Don't be put off by this. Bitcoin isn't too difficult to understand, but you'll want to put in a little bit more time so you don't end up as another BFL, SatoshiDice, or 'correct horse battery staple' statistic.

The genesis block can't be spent, and you can't prove that early blocks belong to Satoshi. Even if you could, he could use a mixing service to hide the origins before spending them. You are also assuming that they will be spent at all.

If a private key is lost, the bitcoins are basically gone forever, yes. What basically results is that the value of every other bitcoin goes up ever so slightly to compensate. Think of it as a donation to every other holder of bitcoins.
This isn't a problem for Bitcoin itself, however, as it is only natural deflation. Most Bitcoiners agree that deflation is actually a good thing.
Also, as bitcoins gain value, people will go to greater lengths to ensure that their bitcoins aren't lost.
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:11:39
I personally recommend Bitcoin-QT if you don't mind the extra load on your computer of downloading and maintaining your own record of the blockchain. As long as you keep your computer secure (virus free, etc.) then this is a very safe way to store your Bitcoins because it puts you in charge of them.
One alternative is a web wallet such as Coinbase or the Blockchain.info wallet. These are more light-weight because the website manages the blockchain and your bitcoins for you. However, this means they actually "have" your bitcoins, and you ask them for permission to spend them. If the website is compromised, the bitcoins *could* be stolen and you would be out of luck. Web wallets are usually alright for small amounts of BTC.
The most secure, but least "usable" wallet is an offline wallet. Because storing bitcoins is only a matter of storing the private "key" text files, you can store them in many ways. You could print them off onto a paper wallet or save them on USB flash drives (be careful with deteriorating materials). If you want, you could memorize a "password" to have a brain wallet. These are typically more secure because your private keys are completely disconnected from the internet, but not as easy to spend at a moment's notice.
Moving bitcoins from one wallet to another is simply a matter of either exporting/importing the private keys or creating a transaction to send the coins from the address of one wallet to an address of another wallet.
@_date: 2013-08-26 02:11:29
Although I also generally dislike banks, they have a pretty good record when it comes to safety deposit boxes. To be safe, you could further divide the wallet to increase the number of banks needed to cooperate to steal your wallet, and have multiple copies of each at different banks to minimize the risk of banks stealing every needed copy.
Of course, you can avoid banks altogether by keeping the paper wallet in your own safe.

There typically aren't "many branches" coming off at the end.
It typically goes something like this:
0a -&gt; 1a -&gt; 2a -&gt; 3a -&gt; 4a
Where the number is the number is the block height, and the letter is which block at that height. Sometimes two miners will find a block near the same time, and both blocks (a) and (b) are put into the network and we get two competing chains:
0a -&gt; 1a -&gt; 2a -&gt; 3a
0a -&gt; 1a -&gt; 2a -&gt; 3b
Some miners will then be mining on top of 3a and some on top of 3b. The chain that gets a block added to it first is considered the "winner" by the network and all miners move to that chain.
If in the above example, 3b became the winner:
0a -&gt; 1a -&gt; 2a -&gt; 3a -&gt; X
0a -&gt; 1a -&gt; 2a -&gt; 3b -&gt; 4b -&gt; 5b -&gt; 6b
Whatever transactions happened in 3a will be ignored and not considered valid unless they get put into the (b) chain.
Hopefully that made sense :\

The limit was chosen for a reason. Satoshi obviously believed that a limited supply was the best option, and I agree.
What will result is a small, natural deflation from the combined forces of a growing Bitcoin economy and accidental loss of private keys.
Contrary to most modern economists, I believe that a slight deflation is ideal. What happens is people are a little more careful with how they spend their money. People will be less inclined to waste natural resources or spend money on frivolous items they don't need.
With inflation, there is a huge incentive to borrow money and rack up debt. That is what you are seeing today. This is why basically everyone and every government is in debt. That is not healthy economics.

The dividends that are paid to the shareholders are spent and recirculated back into the Bitcoin economy. The recirculating bitcoins are then contributing to the transaction fees that miners earn. ASICMINER's goal isn't to hoard 2,000,000 BTC. It's goal is to earn, spend, and regain bitcoins. This makes a 2,000,000 BTC valuation more reasonable.

A transaction of a tiny amount (such as 0.000001 BTC). These transactions don't accomplish much, but still add to the block chain size. For this reason, miners/clients usually don't forward dust transactions unless a decent transaction fee is included.

This is the miner "logic" I was talking about before, everyone.
Miners often rationalize their investment by saying they will make ROI when the price of bitcoins goes up. That's no reason to mine. If your betting on the price going up, you should just buy BTC.
Unless you can mine more BTC than the BTC-denominated cost of buying and operating the hardware, you shouldn't be mining.

Bitcoin-Qt backs up all addresses you've used and the next 100 addresses. So you should back up every 100 used addresses. Note that it will often create change addresses without really telling you, every time you send bitcoins.

Hi there! It's definitely weird the first time you hear about bitcoin and continue to investigate. You will feel a bit disoriented at first, and then when all the puzzle pieces come together, you say to yourself "Satoshi, you goddamn genius!"
The website  is great. Some sources of info that I learned from are as follows:
1. Watch these Khan Academy videos as an amazing introduction: 
2. Watch these cryptography videos to become more comfortable with the technology used to create bitcoin's security: 
3. Watch this speech by Erik Voorhees on the significance of bitcoin. If you know anything about the money system or economics you'll be able to relate, and it's a good lesson even if you don't: 
After that, what is left is actually to buy a bit and keep your private keys in cold storage.

~~shut Bitcoin down~~ make Bitcoin illegal
I doubt they'll make it illegal outright. There would be significant backlash from a community much larger than just Bitcoiners. There would be a fair case against such a decision as being against free speech/expression and a few others.
If they did, I doubt other countries would follow 'just because.' Not a lot of countries respect the U.S. at the moment.


Sort of. They can mine whatever blocks they want, but if the actual Bitcoin users run clients that don't accept whatever the colluding miners do, there would be a hard fork and the "evil" miners would just be ignored by everyone.

Could you please elaborate on the parallel you're trying to draw here? The Hunt brothers attempted to corner the silver market by borrowing heavily to purchase silver with leverage. Also, the end of this cornering attempt (side note: you can't ever fully corner things like silver and bitcoins and you certainly won't profit from attempting it) came when COMEX adjusted the rules on leverage, not because the government took action.
The Winklevi, on the other hand, actually own their bitcoins, and their ~1% market share is nowhere near the Hunt brothers' peak of ~33% market share in silver. Also, that silver bubble had nothing to do with threatening the USD. Bitcoin does, of course, but I again don't see the parallel you're drawing.

It's not so risky from the "buyer" (your) side, but it's just never a good idea. Credit cards are called 'soft' money as the transactions can be reversed. Bitcoin is 'hard' money with permanent transactions.
There's nothing stopping you from receiving the bitcoins and then calling up your credit card company saying that you did not authorize the transaction, you did not receive your goods, or some other story and cancelling the transaction. The bitcoin seller then ends up with no money and no bitcoins.
This is why you should never sell bitcoins with credit cards, and it's rarely a good idea to buy bitcoins with credit cards because you must ask yourself what type of person would be willing to take the chance with credit card chargebacks.

You would create a new address in your own wallet, then use the web wallet software to create a transaction sending the coins to your own address.


Your wallet keeps track of these for you. You usually don't want to go around manually messing with private keys unless you know what you are doing.


Exchanges take wire transfers, bank deposits, money orders, etc.
You can also buy bitcoins in-person from people using cash at LocalBitcoins.com

The miner fee is given to the people mining bitcoins to process your transaction faster. It's actual optional, assuming a miner eventually includes your transaction without the fee.
To make sure it's processed quickly, though, go into your QT wallet and click "Settings" on the navigation bar on top. Select "Options." You should be in the "Main" tab, where it shows "Pay transaction fee." That's where you set the transaction / miner fee. Most people do 0.0005 BTC.

Bitcoin's instability is completely the result of its age. It started with a value of almost 0. Of course it's going to be a rocky ride from 0 to globally-accepted-currency. Once it does reach mass adoption, expect stability to come and the deflationary rate to be tiny.

The main reason I suggest BIP38 is to work around the need to trust the security of your printer. Many modern printers are connected to the Internet and store printed files for some time. This opens the door to potential (albeit unheard of so far) attacks.
If the wallet is encrypted, the printer doesn't get access to the raw private keys. If you *do* feel confident that your physical safe is secure, you could even write down the BIP38 passphrase right onto the paper wallet to ensure you don't forget it.

I'm not a huge expert on those two, but the "nodes" are paid to store (large) and unique files. This is different from storing one of the most widely available files in the world (the block chain). To act as a proxy, you would need somebody else storing the file for you and being willing to freely send you a copy of it. This isn't the case for those two, as I understand them.

Is your argument that nobody should spend money when they could instead leave it "invested" (speculating, hoarding, whatever you want to call it) and be able to buy more later?
Then why the hell does everyone in America spend their USD when they could instead buy treasury bonds and have even more money in a few years?
I guess to answer your question without another question, it's because we want stuff and we want it now. You can have all the money in the world when you die, but you won't be able to enjoy it.
A coffee today is worth more than a coffee tomorrow. If you and two friends go to a coffee shop, they're going to buy coffee for 0.01 BTC. You will laugh at them, saying "Fools! This coffee will only cost 0.009999 BTC tomorrow!" They will chuckle and enjoy their coffee as you sit there with bitcoins in your wallet.
Also, if this argument against deflationary currencies is true, why do people buy computers? You know for a fact that the same $500 you could spend on a computer now will get you one twice as fast that can save twice as much in a year or two. Yet everyone is buying computers. Hell, companies like Google invest millions upon millions of dollars buying servers that they could just wait and buy next year. But people want Google now. They want everything now. This is why deflationary currencies won't fail, and it's why people are spending their bitcoins now.

I just foresee a continued series of big booms and minor busts as the risk-takers find out about Bitcoin and get in.

The bitcoins that are 'in' exchanges are actually already-existent bitcoins that belong to people that deposited them at the exchanges. Exchanges don't just "create" the bitcoins that you buy from them. Bitcoins are indeed created solely through the mining process.
The value of a bitcoin is derived purely from what people value it as. It works just like anything else. If Joe is willing to give you a Ferrari for 600 BTC, then a single bitcoin is worth 1/600 of a Ferrari. Of course, not many people are selling Ferraris for BTC, so we don't typically measure their value that way. We measure it based on what people are willing to buy/sell it for at the exchanges. This means USD, EUR, etc.
Also of note is that the reason people value bitcoins is their use in storing and transferring wealth. It's much easier to send bitcoins to your friends half-way across the world than throwing dollars at the computer and hoping something happens.

Please explain how that link disproves what I said.
It does distinguish between a centralized stock market and the "decentralized" Forex. However, it is completely wrong to conclude that NYSE or NASDAQ are, as the link quotes, "Master of the Universe" with the ability to make "one price" and that "controls the spread." The trading rate/price and margins are made up completely by the market. NYSE can't force me to dump my McDonald's stock at $80. As long as I can find a bidder at $110, I can sell for $110.
This same market-driven principle applies to Forex, but Forex is more decentralized. As the [graphic from your link]( shows, John has to place his order through a broker that then places the order through a bank which then places the order on Forex. It's not *totally* decentralized because without the banks, Joe Blow can no longer trade with Jane on Forex.
That's why I label Forex as "decentralized." The general understanding of Forex is that it is decentralized. But, within the Bitcoin community, it is still far from ideal.

Somewhere I read that a good way to visualize the possible number of addresses. Take every single grain of sand on Earth. Now imagine every one of those grains of sand was another Earth. Every grain of sand on each of those Earths is about how many public addresses there can be.

Semantics? Well, fungibility **is** currently a *characteristic* of Bitcoin.
characteristic (n.): a feature or quality belonging typically to a person, place, or thing and serving to identify it
Because merchants typically (almost always, actually) do not distinguish between the difference of my bitcoins and your bitcoins, the bitcoins are fungible. By encouraging merchants to distinguish between "clean" and "unclean" bitcoins, these people **are** threatening the fungibility of Bitcoin.


Waiting for confirmations has nothing to do with differentiating between bitcoins.

1. Don't use Mt. Gox. They have liquidity issues with their "USD" which results in their exchange rate being higher. Try a different exchange such as Bitstamp, CampBX, or BTC-e.
2. If you want to store BTC for a long time, you'll want to put them in "cold storage." This means you will store them on a medium that is in no way connected to the internet. One good route for this is to install Bitcoin-Qt and Armory. Print off a paper wallet backup and keep it in the safe.

I try to tailor it to the individual. If I'm talking to a business owner, I point out the miniscule fees compared to credit cards. For a libertarian-side-of-the-spectrum person, I'll explain how it removes the state's monopoly on money. If I'm talking to somebody interested in computing or math, I'll go into the cryptography of it. For other people, I can show how easy it is to use.
As for explaining how it actually works on a basic level, I like to use a "check" analogy. Bitcoin is a system of checks, where you can write out a check for X bitcoins to somebody's address and sign it with your private key. Then when that person wants to send that check to somebody else, they just resign it with their private key.

I'm not completely sure what you mean there, but I'll just summarize quick:
Bitcoin transactions aren't instantly guaranteed to be permanent, but they gain permanence over time as they get more block confirmations. It's not perfect, but it is much better than the existing systems such as bank checks, PayPal, and credit cards.
You can attempt to steal a few dollars at the gas station with a double spend attack if you are quick, but consider that this is still theft and you would potentially be prosecuted. You could just as easily hand the cashier fake $1's, or just gas up your car and drive away without paying at all. You will be prosecuted.
For more anonymous transactions and very large transactions, it would be necessary to use some type of escrow or just wait for more confirmations.

It takes roughly 7 seconds for a transaction to propagate through the network, so a merchant can verify that the customer has signed the payment.
The ~10 minutes part is for confirmation into the block chain, and is really only required for certain types of payments such as:
1. Large transactions, such as the sale of a house or vehicle.
2. Fully anonymous transactions, such as selling things on some not-yet-created peer-to-peer marketplace.
3. Irreversible virtual sales, such as online gambling site or currency exchanges.
For things like selling food at a restaurant or filling up your car with gas, a zero-confirmation transaction can be considered good enough because you already have some record of the person's identity and could pursue them if they double-spent and voided the transaction.
Consider merchants accepting checks that can bounce, or PayPal and credit card payments which can be charged back weeks or even months later.

1. The odds of winning the lottery are nowhere even remotely close to the odds of a Bitcoin public address collision. Not even close.
2. Breaking advanced cryptographic functions happens slowly. First, a minor hypothetical weakness is found. More weaknesses are found and the function slowly becomes obsolete. Bitcoin is ready for this process. If a serious weakness in SHA256 is found, another function can be added on after a certain block before it even becomes a problem.
    if (blockHeight &lt; heightUsingNewFunction){
     doThis();

As a college student, I keep my expenses at a minimum ;)
There is a local bar already accepting BTC, and our local Bitcoin meetup is growing very quickly (30+ people at last night's meeting). Many of the members are open to accepting BTC for their businesses. One of them is opening a BTC-accepting restaurant soon, and I'll be making his website for him.
I already submitted a formal proposal to my university to begin accepting BTC for tuition, housing, and meal plans. Haven't heard back, but I think I will pursue it later.
Long story short, I'm currently still spending Bernankecoins at the grocery store and using BTC for extra things (Bees Bros products, some beef jerky that arrived today, a couple Bitcoin t-shirts).

Let me introduce you to capitalism. You do not have a right to complain about what fees a business charges. If you don't like their fees, find another business that charges less fees or make your own to compete with them. Or, as you put it, "man up" and pay the fees.
I'm guessing you believe that greed is behind high prices and high fees? So what, when gas prices go down or your bank lowers a fee, does that mean that the bank's owners magically became "less greedy?" Greed is good.

@_date: 2013-09-20 15:14:06
I've got a question.
As I understand it, you plan on having accounts denominated in either BTC or EUR, at the choice of the customer. However, you will only be holding their balances as BTC.
In the prospectus, you say that the rise of BTC/EUR means that you will profit on the EUR-denominated accounts.
What happens if BTC/EUR drops significantly and you don't have the funds to repay the EUR-denominated accounts at the new exchange rate?
I think EUR-denominate accounts are a great idea to attract more customers, but you are essentially gambling on the fact that BTC/EUR will rise. Gambling with depositors' funds is not something a bank should do. This is pretty much the entire reason we hate the current banking system.
My suggestion is that if you allow EUR-denominated accounts, that you actually buy EUR with those BTC so you always have the actual EUR amount on-hand and are no longer at risk of a BTC/EUR drop. Make your profits from fees on EUR-denominated accounts, not by gambling on the market.

To put it most simply, the block chain is the public record of all Bitoin transactions. Every full Bitcoin client keeps its own copy of the block chain. It can be analyzed to watch every transaction. You can see the balance of all public addresses. You can see when A sends X bitcoins to B, and then watch to see where B sends those coins. You can see what address(es) A got the X bitcoins from.
This is why Bitcoin is pseudonymous and not anonymous. You can see every address, but it's not exactly easy to link an address to a person's name.
@_date: 2013-08-16 18:48:08


Exactly. They could, in theory, try to buy up all the Bitcoin to skyrocket the price, and then dump to scare everyone. Of course, passing legislation to allow them to do this wouldn't be easy. Also, while they might think they can disrupt the market and cause everyone to lose faith, all they would do is put profit in the pockets of actual investors.

You're implying that there would be a decrease in basically all up-front investments. I think the opposite is true.

As the value of the currency slowly increases, the numeric size of wages would decrease at a similar rate. I have some personal experience with this as I am currently working for a company that pays me entirely in bitcoins. The rate at which I am paid is determined entirely by the current market valuation of bitcoins at the time of payment. It doesn't bother me to see my actual wages decrease because I know that I am getting the same value payment and that my previous wages have now become more valuable.
Of course, the rate of "deflation" (We'll go with the idea of deflationary currencies being those that increase in value as opposed to simply a decrease in the monetary base, since by that definition bitcoins are technically inflationary at the moment. We know what we mean when we say bitcoins are deflationary.) is very high right now as Bitcoin adoption grows rapidly. Once it has reached full adoption, the actual rate of deflation will be a very small percentage based solely on lost bitcoins and the expanding economy. This percentage or two of inflation per year would probably have a minimal noticeable effect.
As for the idea of "sticky wages," I would ask that you be a little more specific. If employees or unions refuse to accept pay "cuts" caused by a deflationary currency, they are acting irrationally and essentially demanding a pay raise in terms of valuation. That's fine. I don't care if individuals or *voluntary*  unions want to bargain with their employers, but they might be left in the dust to competing employees who are willing to accept monetary facts.

Communism can be a broader description, and anarcho-communism a more specific ideology.
Communism is the economic movement to create a classless and moneyless society where everyone shares ownership of the means of production. Almost all communists are anarcho-communists, where they also believe that the state might be required to achieve communism, but once communism has been established the state would dissolve voluntarily.
An example of attempted communism that was not anarcho-communism would be Soviet Russia. There was still a government, but they tried communism.

The bulls are buying up existing sell orders and very few people are placing bid orders. So as the price goes up, it's riding on a very thin layer of actual support. When a large sale happens (as shown here) it will plummet the price down due to the lack of supporting bids. However, everyone in the market reacts to this after the fact and bring it back up to where it was.

Can I propose a theory?
Miner A was being sneaky and running miner software that withheld the valid block when it was found. Miner A then intended to wait until it accumulated an ideal number of shares to submit before submitting the block.
When Miner B submitted a valid block while Miner A was waiting, Miner A's software automatically spat out its own block hoping the network would accept it instead.
It seems this type of withholding attack isn't particularly useful against a round-based pool, though.

A short time frame relative to the rest of the process. We're seeing businesses go from not accepting BTC at all to accepting BTC as USD at a slow rate, because it takes time to educate business owners on BTC and for them to actually implement it.
Going from "accepting BTC as USD" to just accepting BTC and not converting, though, would take very little effort once we reach critical mass.
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:20:01
Two miners found two solutions for the same block height. The second found his block before the first block propagated to him, so he didn't know that the block was already found.
At that point, you just have to wait until the next block is found on top of one of these blocks. Then whichever one is not built upon becomes "orphaned" and is not part of the main block chain.
@_date: 2013-09-18 21:00:59
Beat them to the punchline.
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:47:00
Haven't we already done the math on this?
If you have 25% of the network, the odds of you finding a second block to add to your "lead" before somebody else publishes a block is 25%.
That's a 75% chance that your original block has to compete with the honest block. Since the honest block is published first and you have to respond by publishing yours, most miners will already be trying to work on the honest block. You will usually end up with your block orphaned.
So you're risking losing an entire block discovery, and for what gain? You won't be earning more bitcoins by stopping everyone else from earning bitcoins. You would have to maintain this attack long enough for it to affect the difficulty. By that time, you will have lost more in your unsuccessful and orphaned blocks than you will have gained by having a lower difficulty. Not to mention the value of the bitcoins you are mining will drop significantly if you pose any serious threat to the network.

Your second option is to mine BTC.
How do you decide whether to buy or mine BTC? You calculate the estimated **mining profitability** using my methods described in other comments. Put everything in terms of BTC. This will tell you that if you invested $1000 (10 BTC) into mining how many BTC you would get out of it.
If your produced bitcoins are greater than your cost in bitcoins (10 BTC), you should mine. If you produce less, you should buy bitcoins instead of mining.

It must have propagated to the rest of the network, since it did get mined after all.
I'm just curious as to why the propagation never made it to blockchain.info.
Perhaps my transaction got sucked up by some miners who then hid the transaction by not passing it on to the rest of the network until they mined a block with it. But that's a huuuuuge stretch at this point. I'm guessing it's just something on blockchain.info's end, and it's really no big deal. It was just odd.

That altcoin won't have the mining network, user base, distribution of wealth, or merchant  base.


That's just kind of ignorant. The protocol includes a difficulty retarget to keep the average block discovery rate at 1 every 10 minutes.


If mining becomes unprofitable, the least profitable miners will stop mining. This drop in competition will increase rewards for all the other miners, making it profitable again. The whole thing will rinse and repeat constantly and smoothly, keeping the average profitability hovering at near-zero.

Bitcoin is a protocol, a way that computers communicate with each other. It runs on open-source, free clients that are referred to as wallets. These wallets store your private keys (the passwords to your bitcoins).
You can send bitcoins from your wallet to somebody else's wallet by sending a transaction into the Bitcoin network. This transaction will be validated by the process referred to as mining.
Mining is what makes the network strong. People dedicate powerful hardware to do guess-and-check math that adds transactions to the public ledger. Miners are rewarded with (optional) transaction fees and with newly minted bitcoins.
These newly-minted bitcoins are minted at a fixed rate that is halved at a fixed rate. The result is that the total number of bitcoins in circulation will continue to approach the limit of 21 million.

@_date: 2013-09-15 16:10:58
If you want to cash out to fiat, that's fine. But it is **not** to be factored into **mining profitability**.
In your example where TerraMiners suddenly cost 140x more BTC to buy, you are suggesting that the profitability won't change because you just factor in the new exchange rate. That's just not right. If a TerraMiner costs 140x more BTC but produces the same amount of BTC (we're assuming the difficulty doesn't change along with the exchange rate), then your TerraMiner becomes 1/140 as profitable as it was before.
So yes, the BTC cost of a miner **does** matter. You make a great point. However, you can't just "correct" that cost by factoring in an exchange rate.
It might seem counter-intuitive, but it's how the math works for calculating mining profitability.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:24:59
You're correct. Understand that you don't have a backup of "bitcoins" but a backup of the private keys, which are basically passwords required to spend the bitcoins. So if somebody steals your private keys and you have a backup of them, whoever spends them first wins.

That brings up something I have been meaning to talk about in I'll write it for you here and then submit as a text post.
Right now, most businesses that accept Bitcoin will use BitPay or Coinbase to immediately convert it into fiat currencies. Why do they do this? Simply because the business has expenses and these expenses can almost always only be paid with fiat at the moment.
So what happens when the businesses that supply the other businesses are also accepting bitcoins through a BitPay/Coinbase system? The businesses would then be able to pay their expenses with bitcoins and eliminate the need to convert their BTC into fiat.
I think this shift will happen within a very short time frame as soon as we reach a critical mass of Bitcoin acceptance.

This is the wild, wild west of political, economic, and social experimentation. Whether Bitcoin dominates the realm of currencies or plummets to dust under its own weight is the big question.
My opinion is that with so much on the line, a solution will always be found to continue the success of Bitcoin. Perhaps the current system with an oligarchy running side-by-side with a minority of solo miners is the best model. Maybe not. I have faith in the free market, but we'll see.

Coinbase is usually good. You don't hear the stories from the many people who use it successfully, only the complaints from those who were flagged as potentially high risk.
I still think the best method is  though.
@_date: 2013-08-25 06:28:40
Here are a few tactics that would come to mind, and why they wouldn't work:


They would be committing political suicide by shutting off the Internet. Also, if they did this, they would only be able to close the connections in the U.S. and not the entire world. Additionally, people are beginning to create mesh networks that would be resistant to this.


This is impractical because you can't simply buy a 51% attack with Bitcoin. You need actual hardware. Bitcoin is, by far, [the most power distributed computer network]( Now, let's say they did accomplish this. They can't really mess anything up. All they could really do is a double-spend attack. And as soon as they stop the attack, everything goes back to normal.


This would be very difficult as described above. Even if it is accomplished, blocks will still get mined and the difficulty will eventually re-target to normal.


This would hurt a lot of legitimate Bitcoin businesses, but would in no way shut down Bitcoin. There would be political backlash, and the longer they wait, the more support Bitcoin has by the people and the greater the political backlash.


This would do no damage to the Bitcoin protocol. While it would cause many people to panic, it would only be a temporary setback. Normal BTC traders that sold into the Gov's buys and bought their sells would make a bunch of profit and the Gov would be out a few billion dollars.


Spammed microtransactions are generally ignored by the main Bitcoin clients. Also, the fees required to push these transactions through would be extremely costly. Additionally, this would only be a temporary setback if it did work.


Since bitcoin is incredibly divisible, they would only be throwing their own money away and adding it to the value of all good coins. It would be a donation to all legitimate bitcoin holders.


We can usually see this coming. Cryptography tends to get broken, but in steps. If the cryptographic algorithms of Bitcoin become weak, we simply add newer functions to it. Also, if they did manage to break it before an update and steal coins and such, we could simply hard fork to before-the-attack, amend the algorithm, and move on. A temporary setback.
There are plenty more ways to attack Bitcoin, but you will find similar failure points in all of them.

If you are genuinely interested in what Ancaps have to say, please redirect your questions to and they will be happy to answer.
So as not to dodge the question, there are a few answers. Identity theft can be minimized greatly when we don't have government-issued identification that can so easily be used against you. In addition, if identity theft became a major issue in Ancapistan (an imaginary Ancap society used commonly for hypotheticals) the first question would be to ask what is the most efficient course of action to remove the problem. The answer would probably not be to find, prosecute, and lock away the thieves, but to simply add some more security through various measures such as the ones we're seeing being added to Bitcoin services.
As for organised criminal institutions, the same question can be asked of the current system. Why did organized crime explode during Prohibition? It seems that organized crime is rarely profitable except when satisfying the black market demands which are no longer a black market in Ancapistan. Take a look at the drug trade. Drug cartels are violently territorial about all of the illegal drugs. Legal prescription drugs and synthetic drugs have entire legitimate industries built around them. As marijuana is being legalized in various states in the US, clean dispensaries are replacing drug dealers on street corners.

Nothing has 'inherent' value. Value is something that individuals project onto things.
Of course, people usually value things for their characteristics. Most of gold's value does not come from its usefulness as a metal in production. It comes from gold's characteristic of being a good store of value. You can buy gold, bury it, and come back to it later and it will not have degraded.
Bitcoin is also a great store of value. They're numbers on a ledger. There's no way they can degrade. Bitcoin is also great for other characteristics. It's extremely fungible, divisible, portable, recognizable, and scarce. These make it useful not only as a store of value but as an actual usable currency.

Quit dreaming. Bitcoin is going to be adopted by the vast majority of people, but it won't be some overnight thing. We'll continue to have media coverage and "bubbles" on the way up. Each time, more businesses will find out about it and start accepting it. Several bubbles later, Bitcoin will emerge as the world's primary currency.
Also, it will be adopted by people, not governments. It's not going to be easy for a country such as Germany to rationalize "buying bitcoins" to its citizens.

Currency makes trade extremely more efficient. When trade is more efficient, resources are wasted much less.
So what's the most efficient form of currency?
Well, we can use something like gold where we have to go dig shit out of the Earth. And of course, using gold as currency means we have less gold to use for cool stuff like circuits and jewelry. Or we can print out billions and billions of pieces of paper and print dead people's faces on them. But that seems like a waste of resources.
Or we could just use some computing hardware and some electricity.

Do some research on how Bitcoin actually works.
I'll get you started with the basics:
Bitcoins are just values held in the public ledger called the blockchain. The blockchain is just a database maintained by bitcoin clients containing of all the transactions that keeps track of how many bitcoins each public address holds.
To create a transaction (spend/send bitcoins) you need to own the private key to the public address that has those bitcoins. A private key is a string of characters, like a password to your bitcoins.
If you save your private keys on a flash drive, the bitcoins would be "stored" on that flash drive (in a way).

Most wallets will tell you that the transaction from your bitcointip account to your own address has been made very quickly. It should show something like "Unconfirmed transaction."
To be "finalized" however your transaction needs to be confirmed in the block chain. On average, a block is added every 10 minutes. The more blocks of confirmation you wait, the more "final" your transaction is. A general rule of thumb is 6 blocks.

On the bottom, you're looking at volume (total amount traded on that exchange in the given time frame).
On the top are the price candles. Red means it went down in that time frame, green means it went up. The thin lines on the top and bottom of the candles go up to the maximum price and minimum price during that time frame. The thick part goes up and down to the start and end price during the time frame.
The smoother lines look like some Simple Moving Averages or other technical indicator. People that believe in ghosts and fortune cookies like to use those to decide whether to buy or sell. In reality, they just give you an idea of the average price in a given time range.

Of course most businesses have to convert bitcoin revenue into fiat at the present. There aren't bitcoin-accepting companies for their own expenses. They can't pay the electricity bill, water bill, heating, employees, etc. in BTC yet.
But as we see companies joining the ranks of Accept-BTC-Convert-To-Fiat, we'll reach a critical point where businesses realize that all/most of their expenses *can* be paid directly in BTC and they no longer need the payment processors to convert to fiat for them. This will save them the 1% (or whatever rate) fees, and close the loop in the Bitcoin economy.

It would be more correct to say that a wallet is software that stores your bitcoins. Then you could explain that bitcoins are stored at public addresses to which there exists a private key. The public address and private key are the random character strings, not the wallet.

@_date: 2013-10-22 15:07:23
It's an issue in the liquidity of the USD on various exchanges. At Gox, it's nearly impossible to withdraw USD because of (probably) banking infrastructure issues. So people that need to withdraw have to buy BTC and withdraw those instead. Hence, a higher price.
On other exchanges like Bitstamp, it's fairly easy to deposit and withdraw so they have a moderate price.
On some like btc-e, it's actually harder to deposit than withdraw. Hence the lower price.

Yes. It's like buying or selling gold. There has to be somebody on the other end making the trade with you.


Yes. You'll notice that even on various exchanges (Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, BTC-e) there are different exchange rates due to the liquidity of getting USD to and from each exchange. There is no set price of bitcoins, it is entirely a free market.


It's usually fairly easy to sell bitcoins because a bitcoin transaction is permanent. The buyer does not have to worry about you "charging back" the bitcoins. This is why credit cards and Paypal should be avoided when trading bitcoins.


First, you should understand what bitcoins really are. They aren't files that can be stored on a computer. The bitcoins themselves are only numbers on the "block chain" (feel free to ask what the block chain is) and are stored at a "public address."
To spend the coins from a public address, you need the "private key" to that address. This private key is a string of characters, like a password to the bitcoins.
Exchanges hold your bitcoins for you in a type of "web wallet." This means that the exchange website holds the private keys to your bitcoins.
If you want to truly own your bitcoins (I suggest this), you should create your own wallet and have the bitcoins sent to that wallet. The main wallet types are software wallets, brain wallets, and paper wallets. For software wallets, check these out: 
Paper wallets are where you actually print the private keys out onto paper and store that paper wallet somewhere safe. A brain wallet is one where you use a special type of password that you can memorize so that the bitcoins are, in a way, stored "in your head."

The arbitration companies would have their own dispute policies. An arbitration company would be part of the contract, agreed to by both parties.
Enforcement of decisions? Well, either you satisfy the requirements of the decision or face punishment. As an anarcho-capitalist, my view is that there is rarely a need for violence even in punishments. Other options include economic embargo. If the arbitration company that deems you guilty is highly reputable to all in society and you refuse their decision, many businesses may shun you and you will have a very difficult time finding someone to sign a contract with you ever again.
Since the cost of something such as an economic embargo (ostracism in a way) is going to be higher than the benefit of breaking a contract, any rational players will not break the contract. If the benefits of breaking a contract are truly that high, then perhaps the contract was poorly crafted in the first place and would be thrown out of any arbitration court.

My point was mostly that you never ask random people from the Internet how to invest. And you *especially* don't ask a subreddit full of Bitcoiners how much you should invest in Bitcoin.
Please consider for yourself all of the risks, benefits, and your personal financial goals.

I've set up PHP servers to send text messages through individual carriers' email protocol.
You can spoof the "FROM" of an email very easily with PHP (although the recipient can verify where the email actually came from if they do about 2 clicks worth of digging). I wonder if you could do the same with a text.

There's no need. You can buy or sell things using Bitcoins without needing a central authority. Also, localbitcoins.com. I never said Mt. Gox was decentralized. I said Bitcoin is decentralized.


False. It's below 50%. Still not great, but improving. Also irrelevant to whether or not Forex is as decentralized as Bitcoin.


The "price" of a Bitcoin is driven by the market, not the exchanges. Also, it's roughly $120/BTC on local bitcoins right now. It's $103/BTC on Mt. Gox.


Yes there is.

You have to understand that this pool is made up of tons of participants. If the pool owner decided to say "hey, I'm going to use this pool to screw with Bitcoin" then everyone would simply leave the pool for another one.
It's still not desirable to have such large pools, but there isn't really a problem with it either.

This could definitely happen. Actually, they already have done it in isolated cases. Look at the ~$5 million the Fed [seized from Mt. Gox](

A 'wallet' is whatever keeps track of your bitcoins. This could be a web wallet such as Coinbase where the website server has your bitcoins, a bit like a bank. It could be a brain wallet, where you memorize the keys to your bitcoins. Perhaps most common is a software wallet such as Bitcoin-QT which stores your bitcoins in a wallet.dat file.
You can use as many wallets of each type as you want. To transfer between wallets you can either export/import the private keys or create a transaction that sends them from the address of one wallet to an address of another wallet.

Those amounts are about 10% and 6% of all BTC. The OP suggested 50%.
I don't claim to know where the line is that people would start to care, but I think we're all certain that it's more than 10% and less than 99%.

Sites like  will show the geolocation of a transaction, but they are only showing the (estimated) location of the node that relayed the transaction to Blockchain.

He means decentralized on the order of things like Bitcoin, where there is no central authority, no central server, etc. The problem with Amazon is that the CEO (or whoever makes decisions there) can say "No more selling product X," or the government could enforce laws against Amazon by stealing and shutting down its servers if it does not comply.
With a fully decentralized marketplace that would run on users' computers in a fashion similar to torrents, Bitcoin, and Bitmessage, no central authority could stop or manipulate it.

Gox shouldn't be factored into the 'bitcoinaverage' because it is not an accurate USD/BTC rate. Sure, it's 75% of the volume in the last 24 hours, but that doesn't make it accurate. If BitcoinAverage wants to accurately reflect the USD/BTC rate, it should not factor in the GoxBux/BTC rate.

1. When mining becomes too unprofitable, a few miners start to drop off. More and more keep dropping off until it becomes profitable enough again. These adjustments will be gradual once Bitcoin reaches mass adoption.
2. Those who would be negatively impacted by sudden decreases in the hashrate would be avoid such an event by simply increasing their transaction fees. It reaches an equilibrium.




What kind of abuse?
Also, no rationally acting miner (I would have to assume a company with that much hardware would have responsibility to be rational) is going to abuse the system because doing so would wipe out their own revenue source.

We're dealing with nice round numbers right now like 50.00000000 and 25.00000000 right now, but when we get down to the smaller rewards, the protocol will start rounding off. Eventually it gets down to the reward of 4 satoshis, then 2 satoshis, then 1 satoshi, and then finally 0 satoshis. So yes, it will become 0.
The concept may be that the reward is continuously halved, but in actuality there **will** be a point where the reward is 0.

If you don't have an ASIC, you're almost guaranteed negative profitability. So if you're looking to invest in BTC, just buy BTC instead of trying to mine with non-ASIC's.
Even if you could buy an ASIC, you would have a lot of assumptions to make and the general assumption is that you would not see positive mining profitability and would, again, be better off just buying BTC.

You're better off with merchants telling the customers "Hey, pay me with Bitcoin and I'll knock of 5% so I don't have to pay credit card fees!" rather than the customers telling the merchants "Hey, accept my funny money! It's better, I promise!"
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:41:59
Haven't we already done the math on this?
If you have 25% of the network, the odds of you finding a second block to add to your "lead" before somebody else publishes a block is 25%.
That's a 75% chance that your original block has to compete with the honest block. Since the honest block is published first and you have to respond by publishing yours, most miners will already be trying to work on the honest block. You will usually end up with your block orphaned.
So you're risking losing an entire block discovery, and for what gain? You won't be earning more bitcoins by stopping everyone else from earning bitcoins. You would have to maintain this attack long enough for it to affect the difficulty. By that time, you will have lost more in your unsuccessful and orphaned blocks than you will have gained by having a lower difficulty. Not to mention the value of the bitcoins you are mining will drop significantly if you pose any serious threat to the network.

Exchanges don't create bitcoins to sell to you. Exchanges are just that: exchanges.
They are a place where people with BTC and people with (let's just use this as an example) USD meet to trade between the two. It's a marketplace.

Correct. To clarify, by an online wallet I do not mean necessarily a web wallet. I am referring to software wallets on a computer connected to the Internet.

Distance from the origin (*The center of the graph, at (0,0)*) is the BTC/USD exchange rate.
Rather than going left-to-right like most plots, this one loops around the origin going counter-clockwise.
As a quick analysis, you can see that the price started at ~$0, and continued to increase in price (move away from the origin) somewhat steadily as time passed (the line moves counter-clockwise).
Edit: With closer analysis, you will notice two bands closer to the origin where the lines seem to overlap quite a bit. Those were times of relative price stability. In the parts where the lines are more thinned out, the price was increasing very quickly.

Keeping your own version of the block chain helps to add security to the Bitcoin network because you would be contributing as a full node.
However, if you want a more light-weight wallet, check out wallets such as Electrum and MultiBit:

Namecoin is almost an identical clone to Bitcoin. It uses the same hashing algorithm. The limit is 21,000,000 coins. It has the same block generation times and retargeting intervals. But it has a few more features added.
You can register a "namespace" on Namecoin. The major purpose of this is the .bit domain system. It basically allows you to register sephyre.bit as a website domain instead of sephyre.com, and your registration is purchased using Namecoins and the domain information is placed on the blockchain. This allows us to avoid the centralization of ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and remove the possibility of a government seizing a domain name.
You can register other namespaces, too. They don't have much support yet, but the protocol is there. Maybe you could register a nickname for Bitmessage so that people could send a message to your registered nickname instead of having to copy/paste the long Bitmessage address. You could also use aliases to other addresses such as a Bitcoin address for the same purpose. It could also be used as a messaging system on its own.
I like Namecoin because it serves an actual ideological purpose apart from Bitcoin. Things like Primecoin and Litecoin are essentially the same exact thing as Bitcoin, but with alterations. Sure, Litecoin is harder to mine and has faster confirmations. Maybe you believe that generating primes is worth compromising the focus on network security with Primecoin. But in the end, they're just currencies. Namecoin actually serves a purpose aside from being money.

If you're new to Bitcoin, why do you want to start mining?
Mining isn't "free money." It's a very competitive operation that processes all bitcoin transactions. If you do not have an ASIC, do not bother wasting your electricity and wearing out your GPU/CPU. Bitcoin is a great thing, but you are approaching it the wrong way.
Do more research first. Find out how you can benefit from Bitcoin other than by mining. Also, ask any further questions here and we'll be more than happy to help.

Don't do a money order through the USPS. CampBX isn't going to steal your money, but USPS will 'lose' your mail for a couple months. Then you can pay to have the money order cancelled.
Do LocalBitcoins.com - You can find somebody in your area, meet them at a Starbucks or similar public location, and hand them cash. They'll be able to give you a verification code (you get it off the site on your transaction page) when they send the pre-funded bitcoins to you with a text message, email, or other easy method. Also, you get to meet a Bitcoin user!
Source: I've tried both of the above methods. I'm obviously unhappy about the USPS and have nothing but good things to say about LocalBitcoins.

I'm just going to make 2 simple points here:
1. Trying to buy 50% of all BTC would raise the price immensely before one even gets close to that goal. It's like trying to corner any market. You just can't.
2. A lot of Bitcoin's value comes from decentralization. If one person owned 50% of all BTC, the value of Bitcoin as a whole would drop. No rational actor would make a purchase this large only to scare away the regular Bitcoin users that make it thrive.

It can and sometimes does happen. What you end up with is two competing blocks. Let's call them A and B.
Assume A was solved just a second or two before B. This means A is likely to have propagated to most of the network than block B, but let's assume it's not a huge margin.
Other miners who received the A block before receiving the B block will try to mine on top of A. Miners who received B first will try to mine on top of B.
If the next block to be found is on top of block A, the miners mining on top of B will abandon B and go back to mining the A chain. The reverse is true if a block were to be solved on top of B first.
Of course, a block *could* be mined on top of A and another on top of B at roughly the same time, causing the same problem again. The competition between chain A and B will just continue until it gets resolved. This is part of the reason why most people suggest waiting for multiple blocks of confirmation before assuming a transaction is non-reversible.
edit: For future reference, the block that gets abandoned is called a an orphan block and any chain built on top of it is an orphan chain.

Additionally, any rational actors watching the site would have a massive incentive to place their bets on the opposite side. Why not bet 1 BTC to have a chance of winning 50 BTC? People would be lining up to do so. And, in doing so, they would level out the bet ratio to a market equilibrium.

Never leave money sit on an exchange.
It's not worth it (at the moment) to buy a dedicated offline computer to save 1 BTC on, but you definitely want to have it offline.
I suggest printing off a paper wallet, loading it up with your 1 BTC, and sticking it in the vault (or safety deposit box at a credit union if you trust them). Read up on paper wallets for a while though to make sure you generate and print it securely. Some printers keep a record of everything they have printed.

However, the reason silver works (in theory) as a smaller-denomination currency rather than gold is that gold cannot easily be divided into small enough pieces to buy a cup of coffee. So they (in theory) swap gold for silver and use the silver in small transactions.
But you don't have to do this with Bitcoins, because even if a satoshi eventually becomes too valuable, the network can adapt a new version that would allow a satoshi to be further divided.

I'll assume you mean "What happens when all the coins are minted?"


Bitcoins are very easily divisible. You don't have to sell things for whole bitcoins. Maybe a gallon of gas would cost 0.000012 bitcoins at some point. So? There's really no problem here.
Of course, nobody would want to think about a 0.000009 BTC hamburger because all of the 0s are confusing. So we can just use different scales. For example, one mBTC (millibitcoin) is equal to 0.001 BTC. One uBTC (microbitcoin) is equal to 0.000001 BTC.
We're already getting close to the point where it's easier to think in terms of millibitcoins instead of bitcoins, and eventually we'll talk in terms of microbitcoins.

It's the closest analogy I've found as well, and it works into my rebuttal for the "Bitcoin won't be the winner of cryptocurrencies" argument. Bitcoin, like email, is a protocol. In the realm of computer protocols, the first mover has a massive advantage due to the network effect. We're still using SMTP from 1982 to send and receive emails.
While it's entirely possible that some critical flaw is found in the Bitcoin protocol that engages a switch to some other protocol, it's unlikely.

Bitcoin has been volatile in the upwards direction. That's generally why merchants (or employees like me) are sometimes happy to accept and hold on to BTC.
If it is a business that can't risk exposing itself to BTC's volatility, then the merchant can use something like BitPay to instantly convert payment to fiat.
So those two paragraphs can hopefully cover the volatility thing.
Now getting back to the main question:


1. Bitcoiners like finding places that accept BTC. This means extra business, which is good for business.
2. Payments are nearly instant.
3. Payments are generally irreversible. No more credit card chargebacks for the win!
4. Merchants don't pay any transaction fees, and their customers pay tiny transaction fees.

We love answering questions, but please do some of the basic research on your own first.
Why a paper wallet? Paper wallets are almost always useful only for long-term cold storage of bitcoins.
Do research here:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
If you're looking to use bitcoins and not store them, I suggest wallets such as Bitcoin-QT, Electrum, or Bitcoin (on Android).
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:09:46
1. I have no idea whether it's going up or down in the short term, but after all of my research and consideration, I can confidently say that it will be an amazing investment over the long-term. Trying to time your purchase over the short term to catch it at a guessing game, so if you are going to invest you might as well get in as early as you can and wait it out.
2. The price is typically volatile.... upwards. It can and has lost significant value from day to day, and this is why I don't recommend trading short-term unless you have the stomach for it.
3. Backups. Multiple mediums. Look into paper wallets, multiple USB flash drives, and brain wallets. These can all be stored completely offline and having at least two of these should prevent any loss.
4.  -  -

It works like any exchange.
People place orders. If a bid is equal to / higher than an ask, the trade is processed.
As demand goes up, the price goes up. As the price goes up, more people are willing to sell. It reaches an equilibrium. Demand doesn't make us run out of bitcoins, it makes the price go up.

I thought this at first, but let me break it down:
1. Send 10000 BTC to Joe, emptying your address A.
2. Joe waits for 6 confirmations.
3. Receive product from Joe.
4. Create a new transaction from address A that sends 5000 BTC to yourself and 5000 BTC to an address that is trivial to crack (i.e. brainwallet with "correct horse battery staple" as the password).
5. There is now a 5000 BTC bounty for miners to abandon the main chain, go back to before your original transaction, and mine the new one, taking the 5000 BTC you sent to "correct horse battery staple".
I'm guessing there is a flaw in this plan, but what is it?

I mean, if you want to use a different definition for anarchism, that's fine. I'm not going to argue over semantics. The meaning of words is open to interpretation.
So let's discuss the heart of what you said, instead of the semantics.
Capitalism does not *require* hierarchy. It is the free and voluntary trade between willing parties. Businesses can be owned by employees in capitalism. Check out [all of these businesses]( including Food Giant, Hy-Vee, and Parsons. You can also have a model where one person pays other people for their services in creating a product (Think Henry Ford paying his employees to create cars for him) and then sell that product to consumers.
Please, explain to me what issue you see with such *voluntary* models?

A pool can't generate a 7-block streak and then go back on it and change the transactions to work their double-spend. They would have to willingly attempt the streak as a double spend, and everyone would be able to see what they're doing whether they succeed or fail.

I wouldn't consider it foolish or childish. We need to avoid a knee-jerk reaction, but "clean" addresses are a serious threat to Bitcoin's fungibility if it gains traction.
It will be months at the very least before the CoInvalidate project comes close to gaining traction. Let's just sit back on this for a few weeks and think through all of our options while always educating the public on the importance of fungibility.
@_date: 2013-09-15 17:46:55


There's nothing stopping somebody from buying or selling their offered trades before they do. The offers are real. It is 'actual market activity.' Also, you are not compelled to buy or sell bitcoins just because the bots are making offers.
Also, they are paying trading fees for all of the trades they execute. This is slightly irrelevant to the whole painting the tape issue, but I'd just like to point out that they aren't doing this for free.


Intentions are a seriously important factor. Unless the article misrepresented the law (I admittedly haven't done my own research, I don't care enough right now) then it is simply illegal to trade in the fashion that this bot is. That doesn't take into consideration what the intentions are. It just blanket-bans all trading activity of this type.

No more of a currency speculator than if you hold fiat, I might add.
Buying A for B with the hopes to sell back to A for a profit is speculation. Earning A and holding A or earning B and holding B isn't really much speculation.
Nonetheless, Bitcoin's actual value does tend to fluctuate much more than the USD (so far) so adjust your strategies accordingly.

Bitcoins are completely divisible, so the price of a whole bitcoin should in no way be a barrier to entry.
If you want to invest in bitcoins, can I suggest doing a little bit of research? This question wouldn't be hard to answer if you took a couple numbers from Wikipedia and did some simple math.
Also, the current going rate is around $105/BTC.

A hard-working immigrant earns money. He wants to bring his honestly earned money back to his home country. The government steals his money as he attempts to cross the arbitrarily drawn national borders with an amount of cash greater than the arbitrarily set limit of $10,000.
Bitcoin solves this problem entirely. It is truly a currency without borders.

They can keep mining, but they won't be mining on the highest block until they get that new block.
Propagation time is usually very quick though, which results in orphan blocks being not-terribly-common since there is (ideally) an average of 1 block every 10 minutes.
That's why alt coins such as Feathercoin with a very fast block rate have more orphan blocks.

With inflation, people are incentivized to borrow money and use that to buy fancy toys and such. The government promotes this inflation because they think that "buying stuff" leads to an upward spiral of prosperity. It is nonsense, however.
With deflation, people are incentivized to produce goods and labor. They are also incentivized to save their money. It makes sense to have a naturally deflating currency where the longer you wait to buy an item, the less you have to pay for it.
Also, I'm not sure what you mean about deflationary currencies promoting labor over labor-saving-devices. Labor-saving-devices are more profitable for a company than paying for labor regardless of inflation/deflation. Saving money is saving money.

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but this is how I understand the ATM works:
You have two options for receiving your bitcoins.
1. Scan your palm in the machine and it will use your biometrics to generate a wallet for you.
2. Bring a smartphone with you and scan the QR code (a two-dimensional barcode) of your wallet in the machine. It will then send the bitcoins to your smartphone's wallet.
If you want to use the smartphone method (I would do this) you will need to install a good wallet app. Here's a list of the top wallets:

Suggestion: Don't differentiate between employers and job seekers. Let every account be able to both post jobs requests and make offers as a potential employer. Maybe I'm a web developer looking to create websites, but I'm not a graphics designer and would like to hire one to create the images for the site. It would be a pain to have to create two accounts.
Suggestion: Add feedback if you haven't already. After somebody completes a job, the employer should be able to rate them out of 5 stars and leave a message so other potential employers know what they're getting into.
Bug(?): Over on the right, when I click "Browse by..." it works fine, but when I click "Tags" to the right of that, it doesn't give any options. Is that broken, or will it work once people start using tags?

It's a good question.
Most exchanges charge trading fees which would make this very unprofitable.

Namecoin itself is entirely focused as a name service. Perhaps it's being used more for speculation than the registration of legitimate names at the moment, but that's not something you can hold against Namecoin.


The fee to register a new domain has two component, a network fee and a transaction fee. The network fee is a fixed value starting at 50 NMC that decays over time in a similar fashion to block rewards in BTC. This network fee is intended to limit domain squatting in the early stages similar to how BTC block rewards are intended to promote mining in the early stages. Over time, both of those things fade out. The remaining registration transaction fee is entirely based on the free market.


Alright, start up your own version of Namecoin with a better system and I'll support the effort.

I'm not going to try predicting the future on this one, but here are a few things to think about:

2. Most small businesses aren't able to develop their own payment solutions.
3. There will probably be some [open-source] development for easy-to-use Bitcoin checkout software so that small businesses will be able to accept 100% BTC without needing to use BitPay/Coinbase *or* develop their own software.

Sounds about right, yes.
1. Yes. Paste the address into the search on  and it will show you the balance and other information.
2. How does what know the private key? Everyone knows the public key/address and its balance, but the private key is stored only in your wallet.
3. M of N... You can create an address where rather than 1 private key, you have N private keys. It then requires M of the N private keys to sign a transaction. Let's say you wanted to leave an inheritance to your 3 children. You could make an address that requires 2 of 3 private keys to be spent, and hand out 1 of each of the 3 private keys to your children. If you die, it would require 2 of the 3 children to agree on a transaction in order to dispense the funds. This is also useful for escrow systems.

It would be profitable in your terms where you consider the exchange rate.
In my terms, you would factor in the cost in terms of BTC when the miner was purchased, the cost in BTC to maintain it, and the amount of BTC it produced. That will get you mining profitability.
To try simplifying my point...
You have two options: Buy BTC, Mine BTC
If you want to calculate the profitability of buying BTC, you factor in nothing but the USD cost you buy and USD profit when you sell.
When calculating the profitability of mining BTC, you factor in the BTC costs to mine and the BTC profit you get out.
Let's take a scenario example. If you can buy a miner for $100, pay the electricity bill with $25, and make 1 BTC... what's your mining profitability? You don't know until you calculate how many BTC you could have instead bought with your USD and remove it from the equation. To do this, you calculate how many BTC you could have bought with your $100 at the time you spent it on the miner and how many BTC you could have bought with the USD when you spent it on electricity. This will tell you how many BTC you indirectly spent to mine 1 BTC. If you spent 1.1 BTC to mine 1 BTC, you have a negative mining profitability. If you spent 0.9 BTC to mine 1 BTC, you have a positive mining profitability.
Sure, maybe you could hold your 1 BTC and sell it later for $1000, but that profitability would come from a BTC/USD exchange speculation and has nothing to do with your mining profitability.
The entire reason one calculates mining profitability is to determine whether they should or should not buy a miner. If you factor in your estimates of the future BTC/USD exchange rate, you will incorrectly manipulate the calculated mining profitability.

@_date: 2013-09-20 11:40:17


For almost all transactions, there's no need to wait for a confirmation because the transaction size is small enough to not make a double-spend attack feasible. If you're selling a house, you can wait 1 hour for the confirmations.
If you reduce the confirmation time, then each confirmation is simply less meaningful. You would need more confirmations to achieve the same amount of "guarantee" that your confirmations won't be orphaned.


I don't see the reason for this. Why would vendors have to sign? You can accomplish the same effect by having the vendor generate a QR code with a simple app that makes a request for payment. There are already mobile apps that do this.


The blockchain is already getting pretty big. How do you expect to fit a ton of information like that in the blockchain, when users could simply protect their private keys better? Presently, there is plenty of security in the 256-bit private keys.


I do like the idea of making coins non-spendable but this does not need to be implemented at the protocol level. You could just make a wallet that doesn't let you spend coins that you put on hold for X time. Of course, a clever person could just open his wallet.dat file and manually spend them. If you are that uncontrollable, however, you could simply have a highly trusted third-party hold onto your bitcoins for X time.


The implementation of this is just horrible. Everything with Bitcoin is out in the open on the public ledger. You can't incorporate sending private emails into the protocol. If you want email backup, use some online wallet that lets you recover via email.
Also, people store the blockchain on their computers. Letting people add emails would bloat it way out of proportion.

When Bitcoin reaches full adoption, there will be many, many transactions every second. The fees can stay small, but the massive increase in transaction volume will add up to large total rewards for miners.


How so? There are many, many companies capable of creating ASICs.


The fees aren't set by the miners. They are set voluntarily by the users when they create transactions, and the amount is to be determined by a free market system.


Denying transactions with an appropriate fee attached would just be stupid, and no significant mining operation will turn away profit.


So? It can already be made anonymous through mixing services, and an implementation such as Zerocoin might be on the way.

Optional twist:
Rather than (for example) making 20 wallets with 0.00125 BTC each, make 10 wallets with 0.0025 BTC each. Make 2 copies of each wallet.
Now explain how each student will be paired in a race with one other student. The first one to go home and figure out how Bitcoin wallets work will be able to claim their bitcoins!
Also, keep your own third copy of each wallet. If any wallets aren't used within 1 week, you can reclaim the coins ;)
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:00:28
If people already own ASICs, they might as well mine with them because the BTC profit is greater than the electricity costs. They made a poor choice in buying the ASIC hardware in the first place, though.
Miners tend to be illogical. Many times they argue that mining is profitable because they will hold the bitcoins and wait for the price to rise. Logically, however, they would be better of just buying bitcoins directly if they expect the price to rise.
Edit: Not all miners, of course. Some of them have made huge profits, and some of them know what they're doing.

To be honest, the block withholding attack is rather pointless in a round-based pool because it doesn't matter when the block gets submitted. You get paid for your shares during the round.
It would work (sometimes) on a PPLNS pool, though, because you withhold all of your shares as well. Then when the ideal conditions are reached, you submit all of the shares followed by the block.
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:18:58
This falls under the list of attacks I recently made, and why they wouldn't work:


They would be committing political suicide by shutting off the Internet. Also, if they did this, they would only be able to close the connections in the U.S. and not the entire world. Additionally, people are beginning to create mesh networks that would be resistant to this.


This is impractical because you can't simply buy a 51% attack with Bitcoin. You need actual hardware. Bitcoin is, by far, [the most power distributed computer network]( Now, let's say they did accomplish this. They can't really mess anything up. All they could really do is a double-spend attack. And as soon as they stop the attack, everything goes back to normal.


This would be very difficult as described above. Even if it is accomplished, blocks will still get mined and the difficulty will eventually re-target to normal.


This would hurt a lot of legitimate Bitcoin businesses, but would in no way shut down Bitcoin. There would be political backlash, and the longer they wait, the more support Bitcoin has by the people and the greater the political backlash.


**This would do no damage to the Bitcoin protocol. While it would cause many people to panic, it would only be a temporary setback. Normal BTC traders that sold into the Gov's buys and bought their sells would make a bunch of profit and the Gov would be out a few billion dollars.**


Spammed microtransactions are generally ignored by the main Bitcoin clients. Also, the fees required to push these transactions through would be extremely costly. Additionally, this would only be a temporary setback if it did work.


Since bitcoin is incredibly divisible, they would only be throwing their own money away and adding it to the value of all good coins. It would be a donation to all legitimate bitcoin holders.


We can usually see this coming. Cryptography tends to get broken, but in steps. If the cryptographic algorithms of Bitcoin become weak, we simply add newer functions to it. Also, if they did manage to break it before an update and steal coins and such, we could simply hard fork to before-the-attack, amend the algorithm, and move on. A temporary setback.
There are plenty more ways to attack Bitcoin, but you will find similar failure points in all of them.

There would be a fork in the chain. Old clients would continue running the old blockchain and new clients would run the new blockchain that allows more precision.

Every block is found approximately every 10 minutes *because* of the difficulty. The difficulty adjusts because that is how we keep the rate of blocks somewhat steady.
Every block found has a timestamp put on it from the miner. When a node receives a block, it allows some margin for error on the time. As long as it isn't too far off, it accepts it and forwards it.
In this way, miners have to keep fairly close to the actual time with their timestamps.

A client is usually something like Bitcoin-QT from  that you run on your own computer. A client like this also acts as a wallet, storing all of your private keys (and the bitcoins attached to them).
If you store your bitcoins on a third-party wallet (not running client on your own computer) then you should beware that you don't actually "own" those bitcoins. The website does. With the blockchain wallet, blockchain is basically acting as a bank. If the bank is robbed, you're probably out of luck.

New bitcoins are minted through the mining process. Every time a block is mined, 25 new bitcoins are generated. After every cycle of 210,000 blocks this reward is cut in half, which is roughly every 4 years. The rate started at 50 BTC/block and the next rate will be 12.5 BTC/block.
As the rate continues to decrease, we will approach a limit just short of 21,000,000 bitcoins. Before we hit that amount, the reward will be so small that it rounds down to 0. At that point, no new bitcoins can be generated and miners' revenue will come entirely from transaction fees.
The reason developers can't change this in the future is that Bitcoin's protocol is very hard to change. You could run your own version of Bitcoin that triples the amount of bitcoins, but nobody else in the network would even listen to you and your "bitcoins" would be worthless.
It requires general consensus of the miners, merchants, and users to change the protocol.

There's probably not a whole lot for me to explain, then. Bitcoin is obviously a threat to one of governments' control points. I wouldn't be surprised if a country tried to make a modified client and require every business to use it.
The problem would then be that all businesses there would pack up and move to another country. All it would do is hurt the country's economic productivity. Of course, making these stupid decisions isn't unheard of but there will always be some countries that permit businesses to run the true client.

It gets rowdy in here when everyone sees their investments double in ~24 hours. When the price cools down, will go back to being level-headed and productive. I'm not particularly thrilled by the hysteria here, either, but don't let it turn you away permanently.
As for transaction fees, credit cards aren't free. The merchants get charged a few percent, and they don't just pull the money out of their ass. It gets added into the price.
As for transaction speed, it takes about 5 to 15 seconds for a transaction to propagate through the network between two well-peered nodes. You don't need to wait for confirmations unless you are dealing with very large amounts or dealing with anonymous strangers.

The price of bitcoin is disconnected with the cost of mining.
Great question! With the automatically-adjusting difficulty, bitcoins are minted at a mathematically predefined rate regardless of how much mining power the network has. Assuming that the network hashrate goes down when the cost of electricity rises, each machine still mining would earn a slightly larger share of all bitcoins being mined. The extra amount of value earned by mining should be almost equal to the amount of extra value spent on electricity.
Of course, that's economic theory. If psychology plays a role in mining and not all players are acting rationally, the automatic adjustments won't work perfectly and mining won't be a net-zero ROI. But it's close enough to say no to your question.
**TL;DR:** New bitcoins are circulated at a rate independent of the network hashrate or mining costs.

My opinion, however, is that you should not worry yourself with trying to play the short-term and buy in at a low point. Nobody knows whether it's going to go up or down in the short term. I suggest buying whatever amount you feel comfortable with as soon as possible, putting it in cold storage, and waiting it out for the long haul.

People do. Exchanges such as Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, etc. don't buy and sell Bitcoins. They don't choose prices. They are exchanges. People can deposit their coins and USD (and others) and then place orders. When a buy order and sell order match, the exchange processes them.


Yes and no. One technical definition of fiat is that it is backed by nothing. This is true for US dollars and for Bitcoins.
Most people that know about  Bitcoins make the distinction that fiat currencies are coined and enforced by governments. Bitcoins, however, are not enforced by anyone. This is why we distinguish between fiat (USD, EUR, etc) and BTC.

It's hard to set up a fiat-BTC automatic processor because there are so many ways to pay in fiat, and most of those methods are risky because they could be reversed.
For example, if you let people pay with Paypal but then convert immediately to BTC, all chargebacks on Paypal would be a total loss because the BTC can't be recovered.

Okay, if you are really interested in Bitcoin I would definitely start doing your own research. Check out the wiki. Visit  Browse for a few days.
Bitstamp is an exchange, and Coinbase is more of a retailer. Their prices are likely similar, and they are both very reputable companies. I see no reason to switch unless you have trouble using one or the other.
When you back up a wallet, you are saving the private keys somewhere. This would allow you to import those private keys into another wallet and have your bitcoins "in" that wallet as well.

Even "the rich" can't force you to sell your land to them. Government, however, commonly uses "eminent domain" to force you off of your own land.


With Ancap, overall wealth is increased by freeing the markets, removing tax burdens, etc. Basically, anyone capable of taking care of themselves would be allowed to do so. If they aren't willing to take the initiative, they can either suffer or, if people are generous enough, suffer the humiliation of living off charity. Those who aren't capable of taking care of themselves would be first priority for charities and almost certainly taken care of.

Welcome to Bitcoin :D
Please do more independent research as it will lead to you falling in love with Bitcoin.
As for this question, no. All bitcoins can be and are constantly verified by miners and Bitcoin clients. Every transaction (and thus every bitcoin) is marked on the public ledger called the blockchain.
Basically, while you can always hack people and steal their bitcoins, it is not possible to hack Bitcoin itself and just create fake bitcoins.

Sort of.
It's not as dangerous with pools, however, because pools don't really "own" their mining power.
If BTCGuild ever attempted to intentionally orphan a block in order to carry out a double-spend, the miners would just leave the pool right after. Also, since this 7-block chain is an exception and BTCGuild can't reliably predict when they will get such a lucky streak, they would likely fail if they attempted a double-spend and lose their miners' confidence for no gain.

Economics 101 ;)
If the demand is greater than the price at price A, then the price will increase to the point where the supply curve meets the demand curve.
To convert your bitcoins back into dollars, you sell them to somebody that wants to buy them. You will get roughly the current going price for them. If people didn't want to buy them because "the price is so high" then the price wouldn't be so high in the first place. The price reflects actual demand, it is not some fictional number.

Transaction fees.
When you make a transaction, you can include a tiny transaction fee to incentivize nodes to pass on your transaction and miners to confirm it. By the time the block reward goes away, there will be so many transactions that the fees add up to replace it.

I would just like to point out something when you look at the difference between bid/ask support.
It's normal for there to be less asks for BTC in the +50% area than bids for BTC in the -50% area, because it's easier to bid for more BTC when the price is lower.
I would have to have $1000 to make a bid on 4 BTC at $250. But if I wanted to sell $1000 worth of BTC, I could sell only 1 at $1000.
The total value amount of BTC bid/asks is fairly close on the bid/ask sides, but because of the value-per-BTC difference, you get an exponential increase towards the left with bids and a linear increase toward the right with asks.

You should understand that bitcoins aren't held on any physical thing. They aren't "in" your wallet, or "on" blockchain's site. All you have on the computer is a password that allows you to spend the bitcoins.
This password can be kept in an offline computer, on a piece of paper, or even in your head. You can have multiple copies of this password.
So when you send bitcoins from blockchain.info to your QT wallet, they don't actually travel through the internet and into your computer. There is no way for the NSA or whoever to know "where" the bitcoins went. They just now belong to a new address, which you (secretly) own the key to.

Localbitcoins uses an escrow system, so when the seller shows you a certain code, you will know that they have released the bitcoin funds.
If you don't use such an escrow system, you should wait until the seller creates a transaction to send the bitcoins to your own address, and possibly wait for confirmations if you are particularly cautious.

Bitcoins themselves aren't actually stored on any device. They are just numbers on the block chain. Each address on the block chain has a public balance, and its bitcoins can only be spent by someone with the private key (like a password) to that public address.
So when you create a backup, you are creating a copy of those private keys. If you are using a wallet such as Bitcoin-Qt which creates more random private keys on the go, you would need to create a new backup every time you use a new address.
Wallets such as Electrum will generate all private keys from a single seed, however, so one backup will be sufficient for all future use of that wallet.

Mt. Gox has terrible withdrawal issues in the recent months. It's near impossible to withdraw USD from Gox because of supposed banking issues on their end.

Bitcoin is currently inflationary at a predetermined rate that cannot be changed. At the same time, it experiences natural deflation from people losing private keys and from the Bitcoin-denominated economy expanding.
Right now, it experiences net deflation because the Bitcoin-denominated economy is expanding (more people are acquiring and accepting BTC) faster than the rate of inflation. This is why you see the value of BTC going up since it began.
However, once inflation tapers off and BTC has reached the peak of global acceptance, it will mostly only experience slight deflation due to the loss of private keys. This rate will be very small because, well, people don't want to lose their private keys.
The reason you have hyperinflation in the listed currencies is because the central banks / governments arbitrarily decide to print massive quantities of said currency. There is no central bank with Bitcoin. The rates are already set.

Running bitcoind with RPC is one way to do it.
If I understand you correctly, you are looking to just receive payments. In this case, you can create a bunch of addresses off of the server and keep the private keys in a personal offline wallet. Then just add all of the public addresses into a SQL database on the website. Now just set up the website to grab a fresh address from the database for each payment and prompt the user to pay that address. You can use [getreceivedbyaddress]( from the [Blockchain.info API]( to see how many satoshis have been received by that address. When the database runs low on new addresses, just generate more offline and upload them.

@_date: 2013-10-30 17:32:26
First, you need to understand what a bitcoin really is.
Bitcoins are just values that belong to a "public address" on the block chain. To actually spend bitcoins, all you need is the "private key" (like a password) to that public address. There can be multiple copies of this private key.
So with a web wallet, the website has your private keys. When you created a paper wallet, all you did was create another copy of those keys on paper.
If you want to remove the website's ownership of your bitcoins completely, you will need to have your own Bitcoin client that can generate your own new address and private key. Then you print off that onto a paper wallet and have the web wallet send the bitcoins to the new address.

If your business expansion is more profitable than the deflationary cost, you would expand now. The same logic applies with essentials and luxuries. If the difference in value of a coffee to you now and in five years is greater than the deflationary value, you'll buy the coffee now.
If/When Bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency, its deflationary rate will be much lower and the deflationary cost will drop significantly. Also important to note, a major factor of deflation will be economic expansion, which is hindered by the very deflation of Bitcoin. The two forces sort of work against each other.

If you bet 100 BTC on one side, I would bet 0.1 BTC on the other side. And so would anyone else paying attention.
The idea is it will balance itself out.
A much better solution, though, is to let users buy and sell bets with each other on an exchange platform, where the "Over" bets and "Under" bets' trading prices total to 1 BTC (obviously could be adjusted to something smaller). Maybe Over is trading at 0.6 and Under at 0.4 during the early sessions of a bet. Then, as the end comes closer and the actual hashrate is edging closer to one side or the other, the bets' trading prices would be changing through market forces to account for the new information. Once the actual hashrate is found and the bet is over, those holding shares of the winning side receive 1 BTC per share of the winning bet.

It sounds like you're doing it more for fun than as a practical solution. Doing something similar where your employer opens an account on an exchange is probably the best option. They can just buy bitcoins with the $100 (or whatever amount) and send the bitcoins to your address.

I would suggest keeping them in a wallet such as Bitcoin-Qt or Electrum on your own computer that you keep virus-free if you are storing small/medium amounts.
If you're completely unaware of how to keep a computer secure, you might want to use a web wallet that uses 2-Factor Authentication.
For large amounts of bitcoins, you would want offline paper backups of an encrypted wallet.


As many as you're willing to risk losing, I guess. Coinbase is very reputable company with $6M in investments, but you never know what might happen to a server that isn't under your control.


You just have to use the web wallet's interface to create a transaction.

I guess as an anarcho-capitalist, I just have a different concept of right and wrong.
If somebody wants to place nonsense trade offers like these on an exchange, so be it. They aren't forcing anyone else to trade so what's the issue?
The only thing I would see as problematic is if somebody forced you to do something, which is only possible through the monopoly of force the government has. So I see things like the too-big-to-fail bailouts as immorally manipulative.

If your transaction is in 3a and 3a becomes orphaned, your transaction would be considered to have never happened. However, chances are that 3b will have also included your transactions. If 3b doesn't include your transaction, then 4b, 5b, or 6b probably would.
The problem would come in if you noticed that 3a became orphaned and 3b hadn't included your transaction, so you generate a new transaction using the same inputs as the other one and send the funds to a brand new address that you own. Then if the miner that mines 4b decides to include your new transaction and not the old one, the person you originally sent BTC to would be completely out of luck.
Of course, the odds of all this happening are very low. This is why it's not important to worry about it if you're, for example, buying some drinks at the bar. The bar takes a far greater chance with chargebacks on credit cards or checks that bounce than a Bitcoin double-spend.
For big transactions (a house, for example), you would want to wait for your transaction to get several block confirmations.

Often times there is a course of action for bank account theft. With Bitcoin, they're just gone. Forever.
With an amount as large as $20,000 I would consider it worthwhile to invest a little in making sure you keep it secure. Diversify a little, and always keep your private keys completely offline. Do not store them on a computer that is ever connected to the internet.
Get a cheap PC, a cheap dumb printer, and a couple flash drives. Get Bitcoin-QT and Armory on your offline cheap PC. Create an address and send your coins to it. Print off a paper wallet backup. Save additional wallet backups on the flash drives.
Now lock your flash drives, cheap computer, and paper wallet in a vault.

The law according to who?
I never signed any agreement to this law.
@_date: 2013-09-12 14:58:40
1. Bitcoin is an open source project without an owner. Satoshi Nakamoto has no power over the protocol unless everyone agrees to changes he proposes. He has been inactive for quite some time.
2. Lost coins aren't important. If you lose coins (technically, lose the private keys to an address that has coins) then everyone else's coins just become slightly more valuable to make up for the difference. Since bitcoins are infinitely divisible, this would never be a problem.
3. Bitcoin's cryptography is very strong. Strong enough that even the NSA can't crack it **yet**. By the time they do get close to being able to crack Bitcoin, we can simply add more to the algorithm to make it secure again. If somebody managed to crack Bitcoin before we are able to update the protocol, we simply update the protocol after the cracking and then hardfork to right before the cracking happened.
4. It is *way* better for the environment than most other things. Consider all of the actual resources spent daily on printing government currencies globally. The mining hardware doesn't just produce the currency, however, it serves as the full payment processor. More useful and less harmful than the alternatives.

Some problems:
1. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not fully anonymous.
2. Early adopters own way too many bitcoins. It's too much wealth in too few hands.
3. Deflation! *flails arms in the air*
The solutions:
1. There are great mixing services already available to launder bitcoins, and we may see a Zerocoin or similar implementation that automatically makes bitcoins anonymous.
2. Early adopters are fairly rewarded for taking the initial risk. It's like saying Google or Apple are doomed to fail because some people invested in them early. Also, the wealth distribution of the US Dollar is actually worse than Bitcoin. 
3. Once fully adapted, Bitcoin will experience minor deflation as the economy expands and bitcoins are slowly lost. This tiny rate of deflation will have limited economic impact and will encourage the production of goods and services rather than the over-consumption we face with inflationary currencies.

You're on the right track. Couple of things here.
1. Bitcoins aren't actual things that you can save on paper or a hard drive. There are only public addresses on the block chain, and they each have a balance denominated in bitcoins. To spend the bitcoins of an address, you need the private key (a password, essentially) to that address. Your wallets store these private keys for you.
2. Your paper wallet would have a "balance" of however many bitcoins are owned by the public addresses to which it holds the private keys.

If the price of the bitcoin stock will go up, buy the bitcoin stock. It doesn't matter where BTC moves against the dollar. If Stock/BTC increases, you would profit by having the stock. If Stock/BTC decreases, you would lose by having the stock.

Well, you wouldn't need to send the bitcoins to a new address later because the address on your phone should already be yours.
Also, you can track all transactions on the block chain. So when you send your coins from address A to B, he would be able to see this on the block chain. There are services out there that allow you to mix your coins, however, if anonymity is your goal.

Merchants can instantly verify that a transaction is valid. Getting confirmations is another story.
A shifty person could send a payment to the merchant and then create another payment from the same address back to another address under his own control, but with a higher fee. However, the merchant can watch the network and be aware of the attempted double spend.
For small purchases, this is already not really much of an issue. People have months to charge back credit card and PayPal purchases. Bank checks can bounce.
For large purchases (a hour), it would be worth your time to wait a couple hours for plenty of confirmations.

Survival, enjoyment.
What you're noticing is the effect of deflation, a key aspect of Bitcoin. Many people, thanks to the status quo of our current inflationary fiat currencies, have been trained to think that bad things will happen with deflation. They think that everyone would hoard their money and the economy would grind to a halt. This is untrue. People will still spend money, because how else would everyone enjoy life? How else will you get food, water, clothing, shelter, electricity, internet, etc?
The real effect of deflation will be a slightly higher incentive to produce goods and services and a lower incentive to borrow money and overspend. These are good qualities.
It's a great question, though.

Mining is a process separate from your regular wallet or client. Don't bother with it until you fully understand Bitcoin. It isn't "free money" like it might sound to be ;)
The block chain basically can't be "robbed." It's a chunk of data stored on every full bitcoin client's computer and validated individually by each person's open-source Bitcoin client. So... The blockchain can't be robbed. Your private keys (wallet) could be stolen, however, if you don't practice good security.

That's a good question, and it hits the heart of why Bitcoin is what it is.
If they achieved consensus, miners could alter the protocol and continue a new block chain. But if they made a malicious alteration that merchants and bitcoin users do not want, the miners' new block chain would be useless and their bitcoins worthless. Bitcoin requires consensus from all involved in order to function as a currency. And since everyone involved has their own bitcoins at risk, everyone (or at least the vast majority) will always only support protocol changes that are needed for the good of Bitcoin.

I think you have misidentified me. I am not promoting the government's twisted version of capitalism. There is a problem when the government says "Here, play with capitalism!" but then turns around and regulates everything. I support stateless capitalism.

The volume is much, much more divided this time: 
Also, you could have said that the last upswing looked ridiculous compared to 2011's when it was at $40.

I tried their almond honey caramels as my first bitcoin purchase.

I agree that gold and Bitcoin are very similar on some dimensions, and that anarcho-capitalists should also appreciate gold. However, gold is not nearly as viable as a currency in the modern global economy. More importantly, gold was not created specifically for the purpose of replacing government-issued currencies. Gold is a natural commodity.
It might be of worth that I joined Reddit recently specifically to join the discussion, and I would not have found the subreddit if it were not listed in this sidebar.

I know many brick-and-mortar owners (mostly taverns) and they **hate** credit card fees. I don't think it will be too hard to show them how much easier and cheaper Bitcoin will be for them. It's a matter of time.
