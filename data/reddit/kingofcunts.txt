damm so the whole point why I used bitstamp (easy to transfer and buy bitcoin) is lost!! Any idea why they do this?
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:22:03
which website?
@_date: 2013-10-11 09:30:41
I think Bitcoin is an example of the next logical step in consumer empowerment. The changes in other markets clearify that the consumer needs and WANTS more input nowadays, so now it is the banking system who is moving towards consumer empowerment. This SHOULD be seen as positive and it SHOULD kickstart a financial restructure. I don't say it will be Bitcoin which sets this of, but at least it gets them thinking
@_date: 2013-03-04 13:12:20
ok that clears it up!! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:01:06
just an insane amount of activity, mine is fixed now
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:32:54
you ride the weekend dip? I expect a lot of people are going to do this during the coming weekend
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:44:35
Businessinsider on board! AWESOME
@_date: 2013-03-27 07:29:09
i'm dutch but i still have no clue what this is going to accomplish... we will see i guess
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:14:37
Don't make assumptions WITHOUT any proof. This guy has NO link to MTGox at all
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:41:48
Is it Fiat --&gt; bitcoin + bitcoin --&gt; fiat? or just one way?
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:01:19
its too good to be true and most likely a scam
normally they go for 70 btc right? think think
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:24:29
Create a betting website with real life bets, which people can wager on. Winner gets all the losers bet
For example: On 1 January 2014, bitcoin will be &gt;$350
Place your bet
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:31:23
I vote bitstamp
@_date: 2013-02-12 23:14:38
silk road is currently not open for registration! working on the servers
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:34:16
you trust dollars more at the moment than Euro? If you really want to have it safe, Swedish Crown 
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:08:37
bitstamp passed 80 in the morning 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:17:38
Indeed, if OP can provide proof, no problem and hang the kid on the nearest cross. Until that time I hope people stop upvoting and bashing a random guy.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:41:46
89 on bitstamp, lets get this baby to $90!
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:51:18
there is probably a reason that there is a difference (lag for example) and sending it from one exchange place to another is just risky now
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:48:53
I personally use bitstamp and I prefer it because from Europe it is free to deposit, trading fees are low and I see a lot of bitching about Mt Gox while Bitstamp has no problems at all (fast, no lag) 
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:00:32
what is MT Gox doing? Are there still a lot of accounts waiting for verification?
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:44:21
Yup nothing is sure, it could hit $100+ before the weekend all we know
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:13:31
OP is talking bullshit. This is just a regular student who made a lucky sell
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:00:33
1/5th month, you lucky bastard(s)!
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:56:21


well shit you've got me right there! Thanks for the tip, i'll check it out
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:09:30
just keep an eye on this subredit. All interesting and relevant articles/news passes by
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:51:49
well done cypr..... Mt Gox
@_date: 2013-09-04 11:24:06
yeah thought somethink in that direction. It's a shame and kind of scary that the US gain more and more ground
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:11:10
MTGox Mod? He is a student at a University in the Netherlands... can't imagine him having more knowledge than the rest of us. Just a lucky sell
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:36:42
why you want to ride on the 20 dollar difference? dont
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:21:36
dude stop spamming no one is going to believe this shit
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:59:29
we know
@_date: 2013-07-12 11:58:03
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:12:58
wow ok thats way worse than i thought
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:10:50
yes the company policy is a big relief! i'm glad that they're doing an AMA... finally they are shedding some light in this darkness
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:16:04
please elaborate 
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:09:41
well shit now i'm nervous, but thanks for the tip!!!
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:10:10
21, IBMS student from Netherlands. Invested when btc was $50
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:55:39
both the dollar and the euro are not safe at the moment, the only total certainty is indeed currencies which are used by "smaller" scale economies which are able to provide a majority of food etc. themselves (independent)
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:59:39
The question is: what will the (currently sleeping) rest of the world do? Encourage the panic sell, or buy cheap
@_date: 2013-07-23 15:46:40
is this going to be the same for bitstamp??
@_date: 2013-10-11 08:46:51
The fact that IMF is even discussing this is already disturbing. The 10% supertax would not work when it receives to much media attention because people will take precautionary measure, so IF they want to do this they will try to implement it ASAP
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:16:33
wire transfer next day arrival 
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:01:31
Is there any harm to leave them on a website such as MtGox,Bitstamp,Bitcoin-24? Or is this TOTALLY unsafe?
@_date: 2013-09-04 07:29:12
I use bitstamp and it is very easy, but I don't know if its possible from the US.... 
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:40:25
exactly what I was thinking
My only concern is the power of the banks and their (quit certain) negative view on bitcoin which will probably start to hurt their market in the coming months-years. What will their retribution be? HOW will they react? 
Or are we going to be strong enough to fight of such a retribution at that time in the future?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:09:57
Bitstamp: day high: 755.00 day low: 378.00
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:36:36
loss in bank trust seems like a positive thing for us
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:14:18
why do you prefer MtGox over free/less expensive options as Bitstamp or Bitcoin-24? Just curious...
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:06:48
Bitstamp was even down for 30min a hour ago! Hope that they are able to handle the new level of activity
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:39:15
I actually came into this thread wondering if the spam would hit here, I was not disappointed 
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:02:02
I don't understand why the gap between Bitstamp and China is so large, but whenever a flashcrash happens Bitstamp follows instantly
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:29:36
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:30:19
I like this guy! Professional and business like
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:59:09
holy shit that was heavy! The activity was INSANE
@_date: 2013-10-19 07:13:16
First missing the bitcoin bull, now missing the gold train. It's a hard knock life!
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:17:58
Why did Bitstamp start ONLY verified transactions from Yesterday? I am totally stuck :(
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:09:23
Mid-long term investment? Bitcoins
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:24:25
so what was their cause to arrest him? Some articles say the only link was his linkedin profile......
@_date: 2013-03-26 13:16:48
haha i bought a few days ago at 65 and today at 75 before the growth, it's going quit well
Om Nom Nom indeed
@_date: 2013-03-26 13:27:45
come to bitstamp, we've been at 82
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:27:30
well the weekends are quit "magic"
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:05:38
the comment section was a rather interesting read
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:49:09
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:02:05
yeah people were getting a bit crazy over the price changes, i'm glad that MT Gox did an AMA though! More clarity 
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:30:36
go away, no one is going to use your silly website and even if you mean well, this is just bad bad baaaaaaaad marketing bro
@_date: 2013-03-26 13:14:53
on bitstamp itself it still is 81.7? 
 confirms this
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:29:08
a bit exaggerated, but the spreading of this topic is good 
@_date: 2013-09-04 10:49:19
Yes I saw this on their facebook update.... can someone explain what this means for the users? Is it ID verification etc. like MT. Gox?
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:32:44
Bitstamp: $171
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:00:58
that, my friend, is not clear proof
@_date: 2013-03-26 13:01:49
bitstamp is awesome, no problems so far
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:53:47
can you link the screenshot? I think I saw this post, and it was a 22 year old Dutch student who was just bragging about his lucky sale
Just conspiracy theorists doing there work
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:44:15
what exactly is a noise factory
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:58:26
the buys around 400/500 were INSANE! never seen so much action 
@_date: 2013-10-16 14:23:33
so... what exactly am I looking at?
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:39:57
it stabilizes already!! I expected a lot worse
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:35:25
well, almost every weekend there was some form of a price drop. Sometimes big sometimes small
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:48:17
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:49:07
First I was upset that we don't have MT Gox in Europe, but I start to appreciate bitstamp more and more
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:43:17
so you set up an entirely new account for this post? Seems legit
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:46:04
Bitstamp + China
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:46:40
i dunno, I use bitstamp (EU). No verification, my money is on there usually next day, pretty low fees and depositing money is free
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:42:29
if I had a BTC for every time someone asked this...
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:24:05
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:47:14
where did those 250 btc go?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:06:19
I don't understand why the gap between Bitstamp and China is so large, but whenever a flashcrash happens Bitstamp follows instantly
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:57:58
aaaaaaaand its back
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:13:57
Yes! Let's follow the white rabbit!!
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:17:04
during the weekend, the price is the lowest than most of the time
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:38:37
bitstamp report, no problem there
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:57:21
"my transfer never appeared" ≠ "mt gox is a scam"
You probably fucked up, or you need to wait longer
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:22:39
I was thinking about the transformation of consumer behaviour over the past 15-20 years with the introduction of the internet. Power has been shifting to the consumers in a lot of different sectors, consumers are able to influence the products more and more. The banking sector just seems to be the next market which transforms to consumer driven...
What do you think?
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:04:01
I guess everyone wants to get in on this "drop", when its really busy it can take some more time before it gets transfered
