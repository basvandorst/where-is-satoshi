Excellent job. Beautiful on mobile and I love the "level up" feature. You've got a great thing on your hands, my friend. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:47:34
Seems legit....
Edit: downvotes for source? Lol ok. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:28:26
Oh boy...
You better buckle in, cupcake.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:46:43
I can't believe I'm even buying into this, but...source?

I just got the ledger nano s and I didn't see an option for LTC. How do I add that to my wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:46:00
Not OP. But I just recently purchased 12.5 acres with out buildings and paid under 40k. Northern Michigan.

What hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:58:07
Yea, this is an excellent play.

An agreed upon rule of the community, seemingly made of people who didn't want to put up or shut up when others did. For every encouraging post there's 10 salty posts of those who wish they could have taken a bigger risk when the cost was low but couldn't.

Do you know of an exchange that I can transfer into to get rid of it? I'd like to offload at the highest point I can, as gdax has a hold on sells 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:06:49
Damn that's more complicated than I would have liked... going to have to wait until I'm sober to do that shit lol. 
Thanks for the help!!

Just missed the karma train eh?

I'm not sure what I expected there. Is there a male alternate? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:55:56
Gotcha! Thanks for that little lesson! lol
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:15:31
I wouldn't notice. But then again, I stay within the realms of legality when I use BC
@_date: 2014-10-28 06:35:02
So this is a thing...
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:35:52
I'm not sure I understand what you linked to me?

@_date: 2017-11-29 13:26:18
I meant to reply to someone else further down who specially asked for a comment from him. That's my bad!
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:01:28
I was expecting a huge sell off the second it hit 10k. So that'd be me... whoopsie ��

They'll just run stories about how they've always supported bitcoin and their views will eat it up.

"I AM MAKING THE VIDEO TOMORROW AND WILL POST IT LATE DAY OR MORE LIKELY THURSDAY."
This was his response. Check his comment history. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:29:09
That's a poor investment ;)
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:33:06
Same here. Bitcoin transaction pending for 4 days. As well as the $$ deposit into my wallet. Shows as withdrawn in my bank statements. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:18:47
Good to see you guys have skin in the game...
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:45:14
Really worries me because I'm out a little over $200 if none of this clears. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:41:51
Is there a sub for altcoin trading? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:35:51
I just had some question about trading that id like to ask about my specific situation. If I decided to daytrade, how do taxes work? Per transaction or is it only applicable once I've "cashed out" and deposited back to my bank account? What's the tax percentage I could expect to pay? Also, when doing my income tax, is something I should report? Even if I decide to just hold? That type of thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:27:06
I'm relatively new and using the coinbase app primarily. How can I change my settings in case id like to just take the extra fees? I haven't seen that option. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:27:56
There is no option currently for my state, am I SOL?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:05:15
Thanks so much for your help!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:41:09
So does coinbase allow a printout of the transactions made that I can just give to a tac professional and let them figure it out? I've made a few trades from LTC for BTC for about $5 profit that now seem so dumb, considering I've lost money with taxes and fees...
