ah. the ol' i-watched-it-on-the-TV-so-now-i-know-more-than-a-professional argument.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:17:26
all tv news is garbage

You might want to learn some basic logic concepts before you start engaging in discussions like this. your comment may be the most blatant straw man I've seen on reddit.

how did i miss this?
how do the xt crowd refute this?
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:01:54
how long til he's "outed" as a child pornographer?
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:58:12
i agree. everyone on both sides needs to seriously check their attitude before hitting "post"
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:09:11
this comment is the embodiment of the "toxic community" op mentioned.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:58:21
no one is accusing you of being a shill. 
i am not a part of any "you guys" i am literally just trying to make up my mind and it's frustrating to constantly run into this vitriol when i try to educate myself. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:36:58
shouldn't we be WANTING to talk about that? isn't that the best way forward?
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:15:57
no, i think you might be misunderstanding what i'm saying. argument is fantastic as long as it stays relevant to the discussion. spewing insults or name-calling doesn't do anyone any good.
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:19:02
i don't know. ive seen instability and toxicity from both camps.
it really makes it difficult learn anything when you have to wade through all the bullshit
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:06:26
thank you. 
PS: you can just say 


that is exactly the kind of unnecessary name-calling i was referring to.
@_date: 2016-11-13 07:47:52

@_date: 2016-11-14 02:50:38

@_date: 2016-12-09 02:08:12

@_date: 2016-11-08 23:20:59

@_date: 2016-12-08 16:36:05
not surprising considering the moderation policy of this sub
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:05:21

@_date: 2016-11-19 16:35:59

@_date: 2017-11-26 05:38:44
 curb your enthusiasm. seinfeld with no laugh track.
@_date: 2016-09-13 06:54:54


edit: sorry for being a grammar dick
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:53:13
probably better to just put it on your forehead. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:20:57
is it called bcash? i thought it was bitcoin cash? maybe i’m out of the loop.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:18:28
we should invent one that just gives you a tattoo 
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:40:45

@_date: 2017-05-02 12:20:18
