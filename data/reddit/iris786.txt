Thats called barter. Every kind of trade we know as it today as far as there is exchange of enteties. Supply-demand will decide their value. 
Unlike fiat currancy which is decided by might of the supplier.

All the World is not just as developed as you'd like. Parts with slapped sanctions will benefit most from cryptos. When millennials start investing, whales won't be whales any more.

About 98% of the wold wealth is generated by 1%. What will be their  influence on limited supply of XBT? This idea of wealth is about to be changed. If ever there will be mass adoption of cryptos it will have paradox where there will be a living currency which breeds offsprings that are property of the initial owner rather than that 1%. 
I would love to be proved wrong here. Question now is not if but when will this mass adoption occure?
