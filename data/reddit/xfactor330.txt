God I feel like a moron now. I was 99% sure I still had some btc in that wallet. I wanted to test if the program works with the old walled which (I thought...) had some spare change, before risking fucking something up and losing a sizable chunk of money in my actual new wallet. It works fine now, thank you very much!

Whoever made this has never seen a line of coke.

Installation just disappears half way trough and nothing happens. A bit worried to be honest...

Tried 0.3.1;0.3.0 and even 0.2.2. [This is the OS I'm using.](
Where does it install by default? Where should I look for the log?
Installation starts bar gets nearly to the end, starts again gets 1/4 of the way trough then the install window just disappears. No error nothing.

Np. Hopefully this helps you squash some bugs.
It's really odd. Program is saved in folder which is completely invisible to me (Local Settings) and I do have show hidden folders enabled. It seems to create a rabbit hole of Application Data folders inside themselves which are also completely invisible to me.
BUT if I type in the location (C:\Users\Xfactor\Local Settings\Application Data....) then the folder opens normally and the app is there and seems to work fine.
Very strange indeed.
