What are the expected low for bitcoin generated by your computer for this timeline?

In short you better off buying coins than spending the money on hardware. Only idiots buy ASIC miners....they expensive and become unprofitable very quickly because manufacturers over produce them. If you go back in history you can work out that it's always more profitable to hold coins that spend on equipment.

I've been warning everyone about Exodus. They love shifting the blame and never take responsibility even after making millions in fees. STAY Away from Exodus.

Get your coins out of Exodus. When you contact  them they will tell you your email has been compromised and it's not their fault that you are negligent. It's a freaking Hot wallet not meant for coin storage. Get yourself a hardware wallet directly from the dealer or an accredit supplier. This is your hard earned currency. Ps I suspect someone within Exodus does the hacking of high value wallets from time to time.

Try Ellipal  [ I've been using this for sometime now and also has the ability to exchange coins/tokens with phone app. Also each device can hold about 10 sub wallets...so you can backup your ledger passsphrase on it with other wallets ( it's like buying 10 ledgers but 1 device ). I find it much easier to use compared to ledger and keepkey. Please do not use exodus, you will loose your cryptos. PS not not getting paid for this...lol
