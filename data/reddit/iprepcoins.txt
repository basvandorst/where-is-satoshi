Here is my folklore.. The iron age started with destroying all the empires and making people go back to living in caves and forgetting languages.

On China.. 
But didn't Zhou Dynasty replace the previous system with despotism, and Zhous weapons was iron weapons? It is still a sort of collapse.
The iron age took 600 years to get from Europe to China. 
The European cultural collapse took about 50 to 100 years, but I think it has to do with the speed they could implement the technology. I don't expect bitcoin to be more that 3% of the economy in ten years from now.

According the the local archeologist in Denmark, Denmark collapsed, seafaring might not be as profitable if you cannot trade everything in bronze.  It is common folklore in Denmark that Denmark stopped trading with the rest of the world when it entered the iron age.

Sure you could extract the private key... from your seed..
But the seed is more important, because we should never reuse a bitcoin address.
The statement "If you don't have a seed phrase you don't control your bitcoin" is correct - a 24 word seed still has a 256 bit entropy - there is no security flaw in storing the seed compared to a single key.
But then again I also enjoy a paper wallet and whatnot just for the fun of it.

Why couldn't the transaction have a some metadata, that said that the transaction was either a 0 conf transaction or a fee market transaction. 
If it was zero conf transaction the coins was presumed being send if the top ten pools in the last 2048 blocks said they would eventually process it... and not accept it as a fee-market transaction.

When they don't fill up the block it is usually because there is very little time between the blocks and they publish their block before the have verified the prior block and don't want to add conflicting transactions.

I expect my accounts, pensions and stocks to get a hair cut and or frozen.
Not because I do anything illegal but simply because the government cannot control its own spending.
