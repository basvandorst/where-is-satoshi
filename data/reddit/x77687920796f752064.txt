Yes, this new auction looks to be geared towards those traders who might be asleep during the current eastern time one.

There may be other people in the world who need/want to use bitcoin but do not have this kind of infrastructure though.

I agree there are people who would not be able to afford $1 transactions.
This is where 2nd layer networks would step in to split the cost of the $1 transaction over a larger number of 2nd layer transactions.

If your tx to Gemini has been confirmed then you'll be fine. It will probably be credited when they enable transactions again.

yes, you could wire 6k USD to Gemini in one go.

peer-to-peer social payments.
e.g. We go out to dinner together. When it is time to pay the bill, I realize I have forgotten my wallet. You pay for the whole meal and I Venmo you what I owe.

In yesterdays auction there was probably a user who needed to sell a large quantity of bitcoin and wanted to do that in the auction and was willing to do it at a discount... But this pushed the auction price through the normal order book (thats what the 'highest bid' and 'lowest ask' means)... In normal markets this makes for a clear and obvious arbitrage opportunity... Market makers can buy more in the auction and immediately flip the bitcoin for a fuckton of cash.

3098 BTC (~1.9 million USD) was traded @ $ 599.50 in today's 4pm ET two-sided auction at only 0.25 % off the midpoint.

Nope. This is not a lottery.
In the hours leading up until 4pm EST, trades are placed on the Gemini auction only order book. These are not visible on the regular continuous order book and therefore do not move the price when they are placed. At 4pm, all of these auction only orders are used to calculate the price at which the largest volume of bitcoin will be traded. Then, all of the orders which will fill at that price are executed and any others are cancelled.
When this happened today, ~3100 BTC was traded at a price of $599.50
If you would like more info there is a pretty good write up on the Gemini blog:
