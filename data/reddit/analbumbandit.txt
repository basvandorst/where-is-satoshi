I have thought of mining my own crypto i'll look into it.... would a single gtx 1080ti be sufficient do you know ? thats all i currently have and probably wouldn't bother investing in anymore gpus

Lol nice try dude but i'd rather stick with reputable sources... plus if you're going to scam someone i'd suggest doing better rates than 8%

Not looking for anything illegal i just value my privacy, it is a shame most people don't, if we all valued our online privacy more the world wouldn't be in such a mess lol but thanks for the help anyway my dude

Yes thats what i am asking, trying to find brookers with better fees, i have heard of coinbase but they also monitor how you spend your coin which is a complete invasion of privacy so i'd rather not use them

In that case i'll take 1 millions coins please that joes a good guy

It not about them knowing you buy bitcoin it's about coinbase stealing your bitcoin if they don't like how you use it or who you deposit it too thats why i don't use them, plus the whole invasion of privacy.

Not mine personally but they have done so to my friends, you can transfer to a private wallet but this is just extra hassle plus i've heard of them cooperating with law enforcement so i'm staying clear of them all together... if my morals don't agree with them i ain't buying there product, same goes for nestle lmao

Yeah i see what you mean with my cpu and gpu setup i'd only be making $15 a month in bitcoin, i only need like $150 cba to wait over a year lmao i might just have to stick to my 9% guy i guess or wait till i get my new passport
