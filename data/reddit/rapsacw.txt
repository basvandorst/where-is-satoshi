The energy spent on mining is a non-point. Miners pay $0.02/kWh! They can get a low price because they are willing to move their operation to a location with low prices. You get low prices when the cost of generating that energy are close to zero; e.g. a powerplant that has no fuel costs like a water plant. Using the surplus energy from a water plant produces zero emissions and is wasted if not used for mining (or other industries).
As soon as miners will have to pay a regular fee for energy a lot of miners will stop, the difficulty will fall but the total cost of mining (and thus the security of the blockchain)  will remain the same.

Ethereum is not asic resistant. Read my point again; you need the willingness to change the algo when asics are rumoured to be in development. Only vertcoin has that willingness, its even a promise!
You can change to a POS system, but that brings other forms of centralisation. (and in the case of ethereum; i question the decentralised form of development, the size of its blockchain, and the not being focussed on being a payment system of that 'coin')

Both, first a sharp rise then a drop.
Note every big &amp; sharp drop, 30 days later you will see the value rising sharply (&amp; correct afterwards).

I'm not into day trading, but i noticed one (BIG) pattern; exactly 30 days after a big drop the value goes up then down.
Next one will be on monday/tuesday.
My explanation for this is some whale looks at the % gain in 30 days, sees a big rise in % 30 days after a drop and decides to buy.

Bought some more this weekend, took the money from my savings account (0.02% annual interest rate, do they think we keep putting up with that shit?).

Consider a solar power farm, too much energy is produced during the peak hours that is otherwise wasted. Use that energy to mine bitcoins. Use the 'profits' from mining during the night to buy energy at night. So you can say bitcoin mining stored the surplus energy to provide 'the same' energy when needed.

I wonder when someone will make a 'real' air gapped wallet based on something like the Sipeed MAIX/ kendryte k210, that board/chip has everything needed for qr in hardware (camera/lcd) and is fast enough to do qr detection at 60fps thanks to the neural network  accelerator?

ING: The only Dutch bank that asks customers why they want to buy bitcoin &amp; what they are going to do with the coins when a customers tranfers money to an exchange.
Furthermore; the energy spent on transactions also provides the security of the blockchain. Low energy and or hardware costs &lt;-&gt; low security.

My preferred way of storing my seed is a brainwallet. For anyone who is not bothered about what happens to their coins after a sudden demise it is the most secure way to store your seed.
For this you can use the standard bip39 way like this;
Take your passphrase sha256, take another sha256 of this for the checksum, use the sha's to generate a standard seed (12-24 words).
In arduino code (excerpt)
`void setup()`
  `bool bitlist[ENT+CS];`
  `uint8_t ent_hash[32];`
  `uint8_t cs_hash[32];`
  `unsigned int i,byc,bic,wor,bic2;`
  
  `Serial.begin(115000);`
  `Serial.println();`
  `Serial.println();`
  `//this should return :` 
  `String pin = "Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur";`
  `String sha = SHA256_str(ent_hash,pin);`
  `Serial.println(pin);`
  `Serial.print(sha);`
  `String sha_cs = SHA256_bin(cs_hash,ent_hash,ENT/8);`
  `Serial.println();`
  `Serial.println("Checksum");`
  `Serial.println(sha_cs);`
  `Serial.println(ENT);`
  `Serial.println(CS);`
  `Serial.println(MS);`
  `byc = bic = 0;`
  `for(i=0;i&lt;ENT;i++)`
  `{`
`bitlist[i] = ent_hash[byc] &amp; (0x80&gt;&gt;bic);`
`if(bic&gt;7) {bic = 0; byc++; }`
  `}`
  `byc = bic = 0;`
  `for(;i&lt;ENT+CS;i++)`
  `{`
`bitlist[i] = cs_hash[byc] &amp; (0x80&gt;&gt;bic);`
`if(bic&gt;7) {bic = 0; byc++; }`
  `}`
  `Serial.println();`
  `Serial.println("bits");`
  `for(i=0;i&lt;ENT+CS;i++) if(bitlist[i]) Serial.print("1"); else Serial.print("0");`
  `Serial.println();`
  `Serial.println("mnenomic");`
  `String resstr = "";`
  `for(i=0;i&lt;MS;i++)`
  `{`
`wor |= bitlist[(i*11)+bic2]? 0x400&gt;&gt;bic2:0;`
`Serial.print(" (");`
`resstr += wordlist[wor];`
`resstr += ' ';`
[`//Serial.print`](//Serial.print)`(" ");`
  `}`
  `Serial.println(resstr);`
`Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur`
`0 (252):buzz`
`1 (1346):portion`
`2 (330):citizen`
`3 (1005):laundry`
`4 (1717):stove`
`5 (785):giraffe`
`6 (1623):slab`
`7 (1975):want`
`8 (1469):response`
`9 (996):lady`
`10 (743):friend`
`11 (1721):strong`
`buzz portion citizen laundry stove giraffe slab want response lady friend strong` 
You can use the seed in any bip39 (hd)wallet.
Also, you can use any passphrase, containing anything (dice rolls..), just don't be stupid and choose a passphrase from a quote, or google your passphrase to see if its unique :P . The best passphrase contains at least one word that isn't in any dictionary and most importantly one that you will always remember duh.

I see it more as a store of value obviously. The only value you really own is value you really own. That doesn't include money on the bank, credit/debit cards and fiat.
Bitcoin as a currency is ages away imo.
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:00:53
It is dumb. The cost of mining (be it from hardware cost or energy consumption) is in direct relation to the security of the chain. The cost of securing the chain is directly related to the value of the chain.
ergo: no points scored.

Judging from the api (recent trades); result":{"XXBTZEUR":[["3035.10000","0.47000000",1506038681.7638,"b","l",""]],"last":"1506038681763848387", (1506038681 = linux time in seconds),
the trades are timed to the nanosecond. So there's only a slim chance of 2 orders being simultanuous

The week of the fork is going to be epic! No amount of popcorn will suffice.
All bitcoin buyers that will buy coins and get coins different from their expectation will sue the living daylight out of those sites.
No s2x companies will be around in the west (and in the rest of the world where there is a functioning justice system)  in a few months.
Then at last we can move on to more productive topics.
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:23:35
No. After such a change you can hardly call that coin Bitcoin. How do you suggest inflation to stay the same?
Also, a pos system would shift power from a bad party (the miners) to an even worse party (big economic players).
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:31:29
I've read somewhere that its upward of $1000. But you can assume the price of mining one coin to be lower than the market price of that coin, but not much lower (else everyone would be mining).
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:40:16
Let the consumption grow i say! More is never enough! The more expensive bitcoin gets the better for every holder.
Also, Bitcoin != Visa, why do you compare these 2?

Shame, i was counting on being able to cashout on segwtwit2x coins! Guess the fork won't happen :(

I would call it an 'upgrayedd' version of bitcoin, as in one of my favorite movies.

If you are going to 'store' coins for a long time then keep in mind that flash memory (that is also used in hardware wallets) is not guaranteed to keep its info beyond 10 years.

Would it be inconceivable to assume miners prefer not to piss off bitmain &amp; co in order to get their new hardware in time/at all?
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:19:25
Bitcoin is like a peer to peer message system connected by nodes. In order for messages to be relayed by those nodes every node checks the message for validity, amongst others how big a 'block' is. The Segwit2x fork increases the blocksize 2x. Normal nodes will regard those blocks as invalid and will not relay them, Segwit2x nodes will. So you get 2 peer to peer networks, one with blocksize '1', and one with blocksize 2x'1'.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:33:56
So, in case the hash power goes to s2x initially, and returns to legacy in a few hours, the timing of a transaction defines if a coin is a real bitcoin or not? Sure...
Don't let hashpower fool you, it has NOTHING to do with what is bitcoin and what is not.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:15:28
Really? I must read the whitepaper again, i can't remember that part. All i remember is that bitcoin was to be decentrallised, censorship free, and thrustless. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:42:00
Thanks. I think mining was seen as the best  voting mechanism because all nodes where mining nodes.
Getting consensus now is difficult or even impossible. But just counting votes on one (minority) party is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:38:35
Some don't care, others don't seem to want it (they need some kind of anchor to a centralised system (miners/developer(s)) to guide them for good or for bad, and lastly some want a centralised system so they can try to gain as much power as they can get.
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:49:10
Why? Any number is better than no number? Just ignore all users and go with the miners ?(who are too centralised as it is already)
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:42:11
Benefit: power grab
Consequences for users: price drop, panic selling.
Long term effect if s2x succeeds: loss of thrust in in-fungibility of crypto in general and withdraw of capital.

You might want to take a look at warpwallet, it can generate a private key from a pass phrase. If you are sure you can remember that phrase *forever* then you don't need to write down anything. You can use the keys from warpwallet in electrum to generate your wallet in electrum whenever you need, and you can de-install electrum immediately after using it. For a short description you can look at bitkey's website.

The total hashing power is not what makes or breaks security, its the total cost of mining (Asic/PC/energy) that secures a chain. Asics do nothing for speed as the difficulty of mining is tuned to deliver a block every 10 minutes. All they do is restrict users from mining.
Asic resistant coins: there is only one at this moment: Vertcoin. Its the only coin that will fork whenever Asics are rumoured to have been developed for their current algo.
Whatever POW function bitcoin uses, an Asic will be in development as soon as a POW change is planned. Will bitcoin then again change POW? I think not. Without an agresive stance towards Asics a coin is not Asic resistant.
Why is Vertcoin not the leading crypto? Because people don't really care about decentrallisation is my guess. Big mouth / shills / whales steer the markets to any direction they want. The sheep follow.
This is also why i fear the current Segwit2x fork might well be the end of bitcoin as a decentrallised currency, and i don't see a successor reaching the same popularity/trust level again soon.
