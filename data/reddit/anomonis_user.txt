Update? I shorted at 10.9k and exited at 9.9k. I may get another short in soon (currently at 10.3k).
I’m feeling it won’t break 9k at this point based on all the calls of it going to 7/8k plus the market action last night.
What are you thinking?

I was also calling for a drop to at least 10.5k a couple days ago. I didn’t put my money where my mouth is until today though.
If 10k breaks again, I do see low 8000s as a strong possibility! Good luck, I’ll be checking back here soon.

I don’t understand. Why doesn’t this belong here?

I see you reference Nokia, and you think it will play out the same. After some thought, I agree this is a short term possibility, and if it does drop to the 6-7k level, it will be fast.
On the other hand, I don’t agree that it will follow the longer term trend (correspondingly going to ~1k), and if 6k comes, we will subsequently see a healthier upward trend.
Thanks for pointing out this pattern outside of BTC and gold. Amazon chart is nearly identical to Nokia’s until April 2008. I assume you think we are at about Dec 2007 on the BTC chart.
What makes you think (if you do) that BTC will follow Nokia to lows rather than Amazon to new all time highs?
For shorter term, I would be surprised to see 11k so soon. But I’ll jump on that short if so. I’ll be evaluating my next short term call tomorrow.

Which platform do you use? I believe you can do this on kraken, yes? I’m currently ‘shorting’ by temporarily selling some BTC I plan to hodl, and buying back when appropriate. But in the US, this is going to prevent me from taking advantage of long term capital gains taxing.
