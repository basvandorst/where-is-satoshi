$20 is a considered a microtransaction? (My understand was that microtransactions were in the under a penny to under a dollar range)  The vast majority of the purchases made in the US are in the $20 dollar range.
How is BitCoin going to be useful as a currency when it can't be used for most things?

So you're saying BitCoin is not to be used as a regular modern currency for any transaction? Only for high value transactions?

So Bitcoin is no good for most transactions?  Like anytime you go to McDonalds? or Get an espresso?

Interesting. I thought by encrypting our wallets we are placing our wallets beyond the reach of digital thieves. 
We can always be court order to open our wallets to Law enforcement, or by search warrant.

Correction. Consent is not needed. Disclosure is.
Say "This is being recorded."  All done. That's all you need.

Because those aren't actually bitcoin. That's a separate transaction system that will not help bitcoin become successful.  
The original Bitcoin was designed to have the block size increase as needed.   Fighting that idea is an indication that some want to manipulate and control clearing BitCoin transactions in order to extract more money from the system.

#  Extreme case of comparing apples to oranges
Compared to the billions of Credit card transaction that take  place everyday which all get cleared in seconds BitCoin is not as fast.
Those cc and db card charges are the main form of transaction today and are the **main competition** for BitCoin or other dsigital currencies to become a "better alternative" to. 
International money transfers are a specific case where banks are clinging to a high profit and completely false, not to mention obsolete model.  
Why do banks cling to this obsolete model?  because they make shitloads of money on it.  Do your money transfers using one of the commercial transfer services, or **better yet, using one of the digital currencies.**
commercial transfer:  xoom.com, remitly.com

Yes.  There were alter net technologies proposed and even implemented, like token ring networks (IBM), and iirc Apple had their own as well. 
# But the biggest laugher was the "OSI network Model"
(And it still is.) 
This was a model designed by Europe based committee that was concerned TCP/IP would "own the market". 
No one has EVER implemented it. There have never been actual working products available.  From 1983 onward it was promised to be delivered every year. It never has been. 
Today the OSI model is taught as if it's the real story of networking. 
The truth is its just imaginary shit.  The only useful thing it does is provide abstract names for different ways of looking at networking protocols. 
But no one today knows this because those who are teaching weren't in the industry during the "networking wars".

If micro-transactions cannot be processed almost as quickly as they can be posted, it means that BitCoin's utility as a true digital currency is distinctly impaired. 
In the 1970's and 1980's when credit card systems were first using telephone communications to process transactions (via modems), the standard for clearing a transaction was  a **maximum** of 18 seconds.   
Today, that time period is laughably long.  High speed digital comms means that it takes less than a second or two to complete a charge transaction.
In order for BitCoin to be the "Better alternative", it **must complete transactions in a timely fashion.**  "Timely" in today's world means that the transaction should be completed so quickly its almost invisible in order for the purchased product or service to be taken by the purchaser.  
If BitCoin is to be a functionally seamless mode of transacting payments, this is absolutely essential.

OP, can you estimate what the % remittance cost would have been for a $200 transfer?

Not if those means give control of clearing BT txns to a small group.

Do you have a capsule explanation anywhere?

And Academic audiences concede when overwhelming logic shows their position to be wrong instead of basing their decisions on greed and control. 
The large pools in control of Bitcoin are not academics. They are economic cartel-like teams trying to gather and control more and more resources.
The idea of comparing this situation to "mature academics" is not even remotely realistic.

I'm specifically asking if the country can be economically stabilized if a special effort is made to implement lots of bitcoin access all over the country.
And I'm asking what would have to be done.

This sounds like they are saying, "Don't use coinbase because its just as inconvenient as regular banking." 
Stick with real bitcoin.

I used to write software for Back-office portion of Point-of-sale systems.   From my experiences there: Would adding more transaction processing servers be able to speed up the txn verification time? Or is this a limit inherent in the Bitcoin  mathematics?

Right, as long as "voters" means:

Answer as follows: 
 - The bitcoins were purchased so I could have bitcoins and to support the idea of a bitcoin like currency
 - I don't have a planned use for these bitcoins yet. I hope they will appreciate in value while I hold them.
 - Yes I plan to make further bitcoin purchases. I don't know when I will have the money to do it. Nor do I know how much I will be able to spend.
I hope this information is helpful.
