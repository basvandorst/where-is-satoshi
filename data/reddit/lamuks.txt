I don't plan to, these are the points that are huge problems for bitcoin to be a real currency.
FOMO doesn't apply to me in this case.

Exchanges is how people get crypto, so it is a very valid point either way. How do you expect newcomers to get BTC, mine it?

25 CS graduate. The blockchain technology is awesome, I just wish it would be used more as it cannot be deleted once written in. Instead, it is a currency that people gamble on.

You are diversifying rather than trying to time the market or waiting for a quick buck. However, you are treating it like a stock rather than a currency.
This is pretty much the right way to go about it right now.

Ill draw you a picture for some :D

This just reaffirms that it is based on belief.


So here is where it gets tricky. This happened, but there are now failsafes and regulations for this, as to not repeat it again, while Bitcoin has no failsafes and regulations, and is easily manipulated and could easily cause a crsis because it is not bound by anything, but belief. 
It depends on preference but Bitcoin allows for whales to destabilize markets frequently for a quick buck.

I mean, payments. It easily goes into tax fraud territory when there is no accountability.
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:28:35
I mean I have followed Bitcoin for years, but it was always a gamble with bubbles popping. These are merely my concerns.

I'm sorry, but the price goes up to 20k, dropping to 3k, going to 12k and dropping to 9k within a few days is not normal for a real currency unless something apocalyptic happens.
This is anything but stable, one day you can buy 1 thing, the next day you can only get 1/4 of the thing, with the same coin. This is not a stable currency. The fluctuations are far too big. A healthy currency shouldn't do more than 2% like this.
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:23:28
That is a rather narrow viewpoint. I merely expressed the problems that Bitcoin has, which are quite significant.
It is in use globally, which would define it as ''real'', bet it is very unstable to be used as one.
@_date: 2019-07-15 05:10:47
Altcoins seem to be taking a harder hit.
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:19:53


This is true, but the missing part is that, even if the currency is in digital form, it is backed by something. Bitcoin is backed by the belief that it is worth something. Real life currencies have gold, or a country behind it, which is worth more, and hence, is more stable. The US dollar is a great example for this as it is no longer backed by gold.


I see this as a massive oversight because of the aforementioned whales that can massively fluctuate the market by more than 10% in a few _minutes_. Banks are at least responsible to countries and their governments. There are regulations in place if a decentralized  bitcoin is what people want, then this will continue throughout the life cycle of the coin.


Currently, most people do this with Bitcoin. The end goal is still to exchange it back to real money, so Bitcoin loses its currency value, unless businesses actually start using it.


I have an open mind, but I am rather pessimistic seeing the recent fluctuations which were caused by insignificant errors. The only real-life equivalent was the Brexit result and the pound dropping, but even then, it lost what it gained previously and stayed stable.

The problem, however is that at some point you need to track, there are actual security risks linked to it.

Short-sighted? Why would I trust a currency that fluctuates so much by free will?
If it is a currency I want it to be stable and strong, and not lose 10-20% at the start of the day, and then _maybe_ regain it.


Holders? So we are not talking about currency here, it is an investment, in which case, my above points don't matter, but as I said, it is a bad currency due to fluctuations.
@_date: 2019-08-13 08:20:22
Random normal people buy it, to see a return on their investment, so they can cash out in the future with profits.
Only dedicated people see Bitcoin as an actual currency.
It is also hard to see it as a currency when it can drop by 2k a day for no reason other than that someone dumps.
@_date: 2019-08-01 08:26:43


This came to mind when I see the meme posts about drops or new highs. ''Why would you care what it is worth to USD? I thought you want it to replace the USD.''
Also, I feel if it was actually used as a currency, that it would go down in price, might just be me though.
