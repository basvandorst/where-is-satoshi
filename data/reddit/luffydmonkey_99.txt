Who are you again? Oh yes. You are the guy with no funds. Utter bs. Shitpost.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:02:55
Apologies for the useless statement I made. 
Yes it's possible but you need to have a bank account there to withdraw that money. And then convert it to bring it back to you.
I am not sure how does the difference in price impact the btc/altcoin pair. If the altcoin are selling at the same price there as at any US exchange, may be you could buy altcoins for btc and move that to US exchange and then sell them here.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:22:32
No way this makes sense. There is something fishy here no matter what anyone tells me
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:39:31
Congrats ���� 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:25:56
I sold at 14k. I know i missed out on the profits but there is no way I am buying this thing until it slows down. I don't mind getting in higher but this increase is not normal.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:31:21
The problem is I think most people in this sub are not aware of these facts that there are better cryptos out there which serve better at the moment as a currency. For eg, the other day I had to buy IOTA and so I used ltc or eth for that. I didn't even try moving btc because I knew that it's going to take hours and the price might shoot up by then. 
It really is unusable as a currency right now. 
I am aware of LN but until it comes out what I said is true. 
I am not sure what happens to the bitcoin price once the herd becomes aware of these shortcomings of btc at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:02:44
You have deleted what you originally said. Can't argue when there's nothing to argue about here. 
Fyi you lack even basic comprehension. Go read what I said again 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:37:41
Got it
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:40:30
That makes sense. ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:44:29
Why would they care about the transaction fees if it wasn't for trying to convert bitcoin back into fiat? Because volatility in the price and them trying to lock their sale? I hope that makes more sense.
Anyway my reply was to the point that there are smart merchants who have don't the opposite of accepting bitcoin in a heart beat. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:49:48
And how can people believe in him? I mean even if it faster at the moment, how do you justify investing in a coin which is led by a con man. He literally said insider trading is a non crime. I would rather let my btc go to 0 than invest in bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:34:55
Congratulations. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You are a wise person to do the right thing at the right time :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:28:46
I pulled everything out at 14k. Will buy back in may be after the futures launch to see what impact it's going to have on btc.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:52:47
I should have phrased my question better.
I am not sure if binance is a Korean exchange?
As far as I read it's a Chinese exchange but they do have a lot of servers in South Korea.
So I was wondering if it might be impacted by this news in any way. 
Also I know they will now need IDs but since I am not korean, is this going to be applicable to me as well? I anyway have a verified account on binance.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:54:27
I have the same question. Although I read that they moved a lot of their servers to S Korea. So I am now confused if they are a Korean or a Chinese exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:42:31
You are a wise man to hodl. But why do you expect the others to follow the same? Sometimes it's best to keep your wisdom to yourself. 
Stop posting such things.
Also you are extremely uninformed when you say what can bitcoin not do what other alt coins can? Please educate yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:08:02
I agree with you but anyone who invests in crypto should be prepared for such volatility. Only weak hands are going to lose money here. Anyone who sits tight for now and doesn't sell is going to come out fine.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:08:25
If someone knew this they wouldn't tell you anyway.
But yes the general theory is what goes up comes down. This is crypto though. It defies all logic at times.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:28
Mass adoption isn't being triggered by genuine belief but FOMO at this moment. And that is what is wrong about it. Way too much sentimental investment. The moment it starts to shift in the other direction and the hodl mantra can no longer pacify people, shit will hit the ceiling fast.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:16:19
Because you are greedy? ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:53
There's no point in worrying now. Just not my day��
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:56:15
What about binance? Is it possible that it would be shutdown as well?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:11
Just zoom out and go all the way to 2013 when it crashed and took 4 years to come back at the same price. 
I don't understand why it isn't being mentioned more in this sub. It recovered but it took a lot of time. So if you have that kind of patience then you shouldn't care about the dip. If you don't, just wait :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:16:44
Is this real? I cannot open the link for myself.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:06:29
I don't mean to encourage anyone to sell but I got out at 14k. I love the concept and genuinely believe it amounts to a lot. 
But now it's just pure greed that is causing the price to go up and not people who genuinely believe it understand bitcoin. 
I will get it may be when this trend cools off. Or may be when the price drops:P
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:37:14
I understand what that means. But for now if bitcoin goes down the entire crypto world suffers. It visible from the charts. 
So either you lose the trust in the entire crypto market right now or believe that it's going to come back. I understand your point as well. No disagreement there :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:54:20
Is binance also going to be shutdown? I live in US.  Should I move out my holdings from it? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:42:06
Then go do it. And I am sure you have figured out how to get your money out of Korea? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:38:39
Age is not a measure of intelligence. You can be really old and utterly stupid ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:33:26
Same here. Out at 14k. No regrets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:20:56
I sold everything at 14k. May be I was wrong but I don't care. I really really didn't feel the price was justified. It seems over bought to me and the profits were way too sweet to ignore :) I settled with an audi instead of a lambo :P 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:19:25
What kind of dumb logic is that? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:25:47
Have you heard of Steam? If not I suggest you go read the news.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:43:45
Nah. I got out at 14k. Now I am just watching how much I lost today ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:12:48
I got out at 14k. Now that I am out I don't feel comfortable getting back in until after the futures launch. I could have let it ride till Sunday but honestly the profits were too sweet to let go just in case everything went down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:10:36
You should try to minimize your loss here. If you invest it and it grows, it's a great thing. But let's talk about the worst case scenario when the price of btc drops. What happens then? You will wish that you had used that to pay off the loan instead of investing it. Plus it's not your money. It's being given to you for a specific purpose. Use it for that :)
Unless it's a gift in every sense, in that case you are free to use it as you wish.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:53:17
I completely agree with you. I love so many other cryptos out there but bch.
It's because they have always marketed themselves as the new bitcoin. Did you see Roger Ver's interview with cnbc? What a douche bag.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:58:57
We have called out pump and dump for so many other alt coins. I think we would be blind to not find this suspicious at all. I might be biased in saying this because I already sold at 14k but I don't find this surge normal. If it is, well good for everyone :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:30
I know. I am watching. Too much fun to see the walls getting chewed on gdax��
I think it's going to 17k soon.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:26:20
I agree with you. The technology behind it is real and rock solid. It started out as a revolution but somewhere along the way some evil forces decided they can make some money off of it.  Trading on bitcoin has fucked it up. I wouldn't go as far as saying that it would fail if the prices drop but I genuinely believe that it will drop huge one day and some people are going to get burnt. Greed can be blinding sometimes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:17:00
It would worry you if you got in at the current price. And it doesn't worry you still then I don't know what to tell you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:07:43
Human greed.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:46:59
Thank you for bringing this up. 
I realised how unusable bitcoin is once I had to buy some IOTA.
I faced the harsh reality when I used litecoin to transfer money to another exchange instead of bitcoin. 
Doesn't matter to hodlers but it's a fact that if nothing's done to mitigate the problem, the other coins will find a way to fill the gap.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:37:33
I don't have the answer. Just followed my gut honestly :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:36:51
Sure. I got in at 4k. I had fun with mine. I will in future as well. Once it cools off a little bit :D
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:26:35
Happy for you. And anyone who says you shouldn't have cashed out, don't listen to them. I think it's a personal choice. But yes. If you had somehow found a showroom that would have accepted bitcoin as payment that would have been even more awesome :)
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:56:11
I did not want to touch that but coinbase severely restricted me by having those weekly limits. I wanted to buy more btc so I sold off my eth and ltc investments but if I could buy more without touching those investments I would have rather done that. Being too much greedy is not a good thing :D
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:40:47
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:12:38
This. Thank you. 
Please use a cheaper option like litecoin till bitcoin is scaled up.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:46:20
I tried that. Ended up losing over half bitcoin. Unless you are really good at it I wouldn't recommend trying that.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:29:35
My point is that it's not money being printed. Some stupid people are willing to pay you to buy that shit from you. You are the winner here but someone is also losing. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:28:55
I literally couldn’t sleep before watching it break that wall. I can sleep now .
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:46:22
This only works if people agree to buy the shitcoin. If no one was to buy it and no exchange allowed you to sell it trade it, please tell how is it worth anything then?
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:30:17
I was watching it and was like it might take some time for that to happen. Came back from the washroom and it was gone. So sad couldn't watch it getting eaten up :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:17:56
There's nothing wrong. They are just bitcoin with bigger blocks. 
Correction: Were until they changed their EDA.
They have the same problems as bitcoin. Just kicked the can down the road instead of finding the right solution. 
If they had enough people using bcash they would have the exact same problems. I don't know why do they feel they have accomplished anything huge with what they did. 
Also some of them got burnt with the recent pump and dump and so they are sore about it but don't want to accept.
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:47:15

Although I don't like Coinbase but it is FDIC insured. So i would yes you can feel safe while using coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:24:06
Why? Some of them might be genuine. This is the kind of shit we are trying to move away from. The government trying to control financial freedom. If someone invests in alt coin it's their choice.
You can't say don't baby sit us. We can handle our money but then also please baby sit us because we can't. If you believe in bitcoin you should understand that alt coins existing are good for it in the long run. Competition has always brought out the best in things.
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:48:53

In a lambo I must add on the roller coaster
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:57:09
I agree with you and what I meant to say is that it will happen as a reaction to more merchants accepting bitcoin. More consumers buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:53:58
No one gives a fuck. You were just watching from the side lines. That's where you will always be. On the side lines.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:24:01
I get it. It's all supply demand. But why this sudden jump. Something must have triggered the increased demand. Right?
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:18:38
I am not your average Joe who doesn't understand what bitcoin and blockchain is. 
What I don't understand is how the market works. 
So let me tell you one thing, I am just trying to understand things here. 
But it seems to me that everyone in this sub is extremely stuck up about bitcoin and tries to shoot anyone down who dares to question the almighty bitcoin. 
Blind faith in anything is never good. No matter what or who it is. 
Anyway thank you for such constructive words.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:59:12
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:39:12
This is so true and needs to be said more often !
Also, no offence but if someone is asking this question then they need to understand that they are not well equipped to safely split the coins. It going to be a mess and if you don't do it right you risk losing your btc coins. 
So unless you know how to run your own node and are able to split you should not think about gaining much from the fork. 
Also if you rely on exchanges you need to understand that the timing matters a lot in such forks. If you are not quick by the time you get hands on the shitcoin people have already dumped it and trampled all over it :D
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:01:50
I agree. It's quite an adventure!
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:42:48
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:19:14
It's not. Just that I am confused if I should buy it right now or wait for the next fork (which might never happen) in hope that it dips again like this time
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:09:02
I am guess the buy walls keep sliding back.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:14:42
Installments but I wish I had bought it together when I bought first at 4200 :( Those numbers are just gone.
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:37:07
Investment option, no trust in the banks and I love the tech cause that's what I do for a living.

Thanks And I wish you well too in your quest :)
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:13:21
So far I have invested mostly in btc and ethereum in addition to a little bit of monero and ripple. Honestly the altcoins seem to be doing just meh right now.
As for the other not on the top crypto, I honestly think most are going to die and to make some profit out of them you really need to be on top of your game. Invest when it's bullish and then just sell. Which is usually during the launch of such tokens.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:41:11
Finally I could breathe. Filling up my lungs before the next dive.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:44:34
Sure it's inefficient. I am programmer too. I get it. But wait. The answer lies in your question. 
We don't want "centralization". 
Since when was holding your money this safe before blockchain came into existence?? I know some people have been duped of their money because of the irreversible nature of blockchain. But for someone who understands what to do nothing gets safer than this. 
Today one can easily hold a million dollars without breaking a sweat. No one needs the stupid banks. 
You also get burnt by fire if you don't handle it carefully. Doesn't mean humanity could have evolved without it.
So how I see it is that it's definitely the next step for our development.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:32:14
What do you mean big drop? I bought it at 5500. I don't see how is that bad.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:39:12
I agree. This post should be on the top
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:12:02
Since when is it wrong to question things? 
It seems to me that you are saying that I shouldn't be questioning things no matter what. Just believe without knowing the reasons. 
Just because you and I don't know doesn't mean there's no reason.
Also please care to share your analysis that led you to conclude to that and I am sure if will be able to provide some sort of insight into why it's so cheap. 
But you cannot because it's all hypothetical what you are saying.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:05:49
Oh that was just for the lambo ... Gonna work for my retirement fund now :D
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:16:18
True. If it it comes to that it simply shows that the government has always been an evil entity. 
And i would never let me money be in their hands. 
I will take my bitcoins with me and move to a place where I still have my freedom :)
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:26:38
But why are you mining it with a GPU? Useless. Just search for Bitcoin ASIC

Take your money and go to btc exchange. They can't sustain it for long if no one uses the shitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:53:08
Ya it's a ponzi scheme

PONZI SCHEME
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:23:21
Why are they not a store of value? Can you please provide some reason? 
And then what do you think is a good store of value? 
And what is that you can't buy with fiat that you want to buy with crypto?
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:23:20
That's not a correct approach to look at things. It's like you don't want to know why it's happening. I hate being in the blind.
Fyi I am all in for bitcoin and I truly believe it's going to revolutionise the world but then again I am a man of reason. 
May be there are people who know but don't want to tell :)
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:44:51
Once it gets adopted by more merchants as a form of payment, do you think they wouldn't run it to for the same reason a person is running the node now?
Imagine Amazon accepts bitcoin in future. Would they not run full nodes on their own?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:42:33
Someone make it stop!!!! Make it fucking stop!!
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:08:52
I totally agree with you. But just for my knowledge. How easy is it for someone to locate me? Because let's say I never give any hints as to where I live then how can they find me?
Just trying to figure out a rough path of how someone could use my reddit history for that.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:30:11
I am thinking the same. Just that the fork is creating some indecisiveness in my mind about how things are going to look in a few days. I hope everyone backs out and there is no fork
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:03:13
That is so true. If they didn't have that stupid limit and the whole process of verification when you register I could have bought during the China ban. I miss it :(
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:26:53
Nothing to disagree about here. Though I usually don't talk much :D
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:19:50
Great.  By that logic why do we have so many fiat currencies then? What separates them? Nothing. Everything is dogshit.
Tell me one advantage of fiat over crypto? If you are going to say that no one uses crypto for payments keep it to yourself because merchants do and global adoption takes time. 
As it's said "Rome was not built in a day." It takes time. Crypto is evolving. 
The change is inevitable. 
Don't worry it's not your fault. Some people are afraid of changes. The history is full of such examples. But in the end no one can stop the change from happening.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:38:20
There's definitely some learning to do. But if you at least get the basics i think it's fine. To get involved in all the forking discussions there's a lot you would want to know. I don't have any links on hands right now but here's the original paper for bitcoin 
Also for the wallet I use a ledger nano s and since I haven't used any other wallet so I might be biased when I say it's awesome for its price.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:04:38
I get your point. But the thing is you never know when the dip stops and it starts rising for real. 
I bought some now. If it dips more I will buy again :)
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:59:38
I hope so!
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:46:05
Tbh I started investing when it was 4k so I am still not in red but very close to it. 
I have lost over 100k in profits though.
Just want to see how this plays out. It will definitely go higher in the long term but I am not sure how long is this bear market going to be? May be an year.. Or two.. Who knows
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:41:32
Ledger seems to be on top of their game these days. 
I personally use ledger but again both are good
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:12:38
And then there would be some who would want to promote some fake bitcoin instead of the real one :P Who gets to decide? Miners or nodes? :P
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:28:00
Such bullshit. It's not constructive at all.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:33:31
Stocks and bonds and around 10% in crypto and around 50% in cash. Now don't tell me that if you believe in crypto why don't you put everything in it. 
It's because it's basic sense. Never put all your eggs in one basket. 
All I am saying is that if the banking was perfect the crypto would never have been born. It's because the banks charge you for things like even having an account with them is what annoys me. I am entrusting my money with them that they use to make profits already. With things like account fees and minimum balance requirements, they are just being greedy assholes.
For eg, have you ever tried sending money from one country to another. Let me tell you , one it takes no less than a week if you want to do it economically and second the banks charge an absurd fees to do it for you. That's just one example. There have been so many cases of people getting defrauded by banks. 
Have you heard about what Wells Fargo, one of the largest banks in the world, did to it customers? 
Banks are not as reliable as you think. 
The lack of options has forced people to hold their money in the banks but if a better thing comes along and solves some of the problems of traditional banking, what's wrong with that? 
And for the other things for which fiat and bank are better suited, people will continue using them for those purposes. 
No one said crypto is the solution to everything but it definitely is a solution to some of the major problems with banking right now.

I wish I had the answer but what you can do is that if you feel confident about the price hitting a certain point you can place a limit order on whatever exchange you using. 
Also another option is to use dollar cost averaging wherever you but for a fixed amount at regular intervals regardless of the price.

Have you heard about Venezuela and Zimbabwe? Those are the most recent examples that come to my mind but there are many more. 
Your 80k means nothing if the government goes crazy with printing money. What will you do then? 
At least I know there's only a limited supply of bitcoin.
Good luck to you thinking that putting all your money in the hands of the greedy banks and governments is safe. That's the most uniformed thing I have heard today. Please search on the internet how many instances have been there when the people have been robbed by their governments.

Excellent article

I get you. Just look at the questions posted here. So much ignorance. People just want to make a quick buck sadly. No one wants to spend time understanding the philosophy and technology behind it. But it's fine as long as the minority who understands it doesn't give up :)

And why is that? I can also make statements but they mean nothing without an explanation of some kind :)

Please read before investing.:) Super important to be aware how to safeguard yourself in the crypto world. You don't want to lose the coins because of a mistake.
And please get a hardware wallet or learn how to keep them safe in a software wallet. Don't leave it on the exchange unless you intend to use them for trading.

Thank you for the advice. I think it's a nice way to get out of the eternal dilemma of when to buy.

I totally get you and I am in for donating some if something like this was happening. But I haven't been a part of any such thing before that was started on reddit, so I don't know how it will turn out :)
