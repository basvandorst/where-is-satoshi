I appreciate that when the mainstream media picks it up, and the reason they will pick it up, is that they can spin this against bitcoin, but bitconnect was setup as an explicit ponzi scheme that I would think even most of their participants knew it was a ponzi but went along with it.
its a problem with the shitcoin space, and unfair to tie every scam that has nothing to do with bitcoin to bitcoin.

A natural easy process is that a LN spend is a signed proposal to decrease my balance in our channel.  I don't need your permission to decrease my/increase yours, and my signature is a commitment that I agree with the new state.  It allows for this new state to be closed out (with time lock) without the cooperation of the other party.
The reason the order of signatures is important is that past states could have included 2 balances 9/1 and 8/2 that favour A compared to current "true" 5/5 balance.  The 8/2 balance could have been a spend by A from 9/1, while the other was a spend by B.  The order of signatures matters because of the existence of penalty transactions, and the power to frame the other for cheating.
The above kinda works.  Though for DDOS protection with a confederate requires trust that the confederate won't sell your secrets to the other party.
If that is innaccurate, then what is the mechanism that prevents framing someone for cheating?

Lightning through centralized exchanges/custody services  (ie. banks) makes the most sense, but also provides decentralization services.
You can put 1% of your "hot funds" accross each of 100 custody services, and quickly move them where you want at any time.  It diversifies the risk of any 1 custodian being hacked.
One of the interesting concepts in OP's wall is the idea of confederates that watch your back for cheating.  Would this create a decentralized version of a service where "Your LN node" (that stays on 24/7, and that you are a customer of) monitors all of your LN commitments such that no one cheats on you, and you don't need to stay online for it.  "Your LN node" can have confederates that mutually protect themselves from DDOS attacks.  Are there ways for such LN services to screw their clients?
Though I don't get the details of how this works:


I thought that if a balance of 900 100 existed (say closing 1000 blocks in future) before it is adjusted to 500 500 (closing 990 blocks in future), that if the one who had the previous 900 balance tries to cheat, the only response is to post the 500 500 transaction.  Or is there some mechanism that allows taking the full 1000?
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:13:22
after doing some (google rather than source) research, the way it apparently works is that LN txs are actually signed by 1 of 2 parties. The 2nd of 2 sigs is provably sequential (ie includes hash of 1st sig).  That 2nd sig fulfills the conditions for broadcasting, and should never be signed unless it is to broadcast on main chain, or to give to a 3rd party (friend or at worst disinterested) to broadcast in an emergency cheating of your counterparty situation.
From this, I imagine that the way to structure penalty transactions is to reference past transactions in future ones.  This requires a conditional tx (not aware that bitcoin mainchain has this feature) that "if this other tx has 2 of 2 signatures and is present then steal full chanel amount" and this clause is signed 1 of 2 by the counterparty who could cheat.  This contract would be independent of the main chanel, but is part of a LN chanel spend 1of2 where the spender renounces the previous chanel balance.  The penalty commitment is optional though... ie the balance commitment is valid without it.  The trust level for the counterparty is simply lower if it is not present.

Any current exchange can get involved in merchant services.  Customers and Merchants could have accounts there, and the exchange mediates disputes (but also adjusts balances with 0 on chain fees on purchases)
Lightning makes it easy for the merchant and customer to be clients of different exchanges, but have some dispute mechanism (though merchant's exchanged may be biased towards their customer)

When you want to route a transaction on the path a-b-c-d, does `a` query b and c for their fees to do the routing?  Or does b and c "advertise" standard fees?
If all network balances are public, and c knows its the only path to d (or b knows its essential), then under the individual query model, c can be a monopolistic asshole (up to the limit of inducing a and d to pay to set up a (more) direct path).  
But behaving like a short term opportunistic asshole is going to cause loss of channel partnerships.  Its like Dominos pizza finding out, through NSA-like omniscient powers, that your phone only has the sufficient functioning keys to use it as a delivery service, and then doubling/trippling the price.  You know that they are using omniscience to be an asshole directly to you, but as soon as you fix your phone, you will blacklist them, and make a reddit thread about what assholes they are.
So, I'd expect that nodes would take a more cooperative attitude overall.
Also, with variable fees, if Alice has a 10-0 balance with "a target" (you) it should be more willing to offer low fees for routing a payment to you, because only after the channel gets balanced, can more transactions flow the other way.  Basically, if Alice is a bitch about sending you money, there's no more opportunity for the channel, and it might as well be closed.
A transaction that turns a channel into a more unidirectional mode should have a higher fee than one that restores bidirectional "power".

its a problem too, but I think it just delays time before coins are spendable (clear period when tx that created coins is revokable) rather than prevent txs from being included in a block.  Still, adding uses for btc is not going to clear the mempool, and so the "congested" flag is going to be set indefinitely, which means indefinitely unspendable coins.
Actually, what these problems create is that LN 1.0 can be successful on LTC or BTG.  With the size limit parameters, about $10 max channel size.  But it makes more sense to make those platforms the "real money" test, that actually does allow the developers rationale of asking for bug forgiveness with a beer.
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:50:29
I see.  LN balances need to be public so that routing can be solved, too.  So a connection can know it has a monopoly over you, and set fees accordingly.  Except if payer pays fees, the monopoly is only "useful" if its in the spend direction?  And Alice could not control the routing in the spend direction from you, the way she created a monopoly for herself in the receive direction.

Also, every other coin has perceived value because bitcoin has perceived value.
Yet a key difference is that it is expensive to create bitcoin.  Stainless steel, nickel, brass jewelry may be as pretty as gold, but gold is preferred because its expensive.
POS coins don't have the external electricity cost that creates a floor in value.  That 1000 imaginary coins entitles you to 1 imaginary coin doesn't support any external value of the coin.

also for liquidity, a physical ETF could hedge with futures.  Redemption is for cash.  It could also do private blocktrades.  I think GBTC lets rich people buy in at NAV value instead of trade at the always higher market price. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:46:47
Also for valuation and liquidity issues, if you give ETF holders the option to redeem in bitcoin then the valuation index used is completely irrelevant (even though its irrelevant to setting ETF market price), and the liquidity question is also completely irrelevant.  Easy to redeem ETF shares for bitcoin payment to their private or coinbase accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:23:15
the part that concerns me is that balance updates on a chanel are made through future (on chain) transactions, and so I assume those need to use a fee (high enough) guaranteed to go through under any circumstance... ? 
IIUC, opening a chanel doesn't necessarily imply a (high) fee if closing a chanel pays for child tx.  That is, the chanel is open before the tx for it confirms, I think.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:07:04
assuming there are no electricity/processing costs, and no other way to earn money/interest on bitcoin holdings,
The cost of a chanel is the bitcoin fee of opening and closing it (and topping it up).  $50 is a reasonable number for this cost.  Under 5cents for bitcoin gold though.
This is practically free for a chanel between coinbase and bitstamp.  A merchant services (crypto paypal/visa) company would probably pay exchanges to have chanels with it.
But basically for a gateway that accepts random joe chanels, and needs to have "backbone" connections, the costs to close the chanel (paid by the gateway) would be the starting fee (balance to gateway) for random joe.  Random joe would (need to) also be paying for a portion of all of the backbone connections (open+close+possible top up) fees.
This makes the LN have narrow (but important) use cases when the main chain has high fees.  BTG has better use cases, when the insurance against centralized risks is much cheaper.
A mainchain fee reduction proposal:   Though, LN will decongest the chain, and so lower fees, through the main narrow use cases that take up much of the chain space.  Centralization (and LN facilitates cooperation among several centralized entities) is basically the solution to congestion. 
There's still a use case for making a gateway service.  You want to have a chanel between you and say coinbase for the main flow purpose of sending btc from coinbase account to you as "insurance" against coinbase fubar.  That chanel is free if the fees are the insurance value.  Offering gateway services though, helps maintain the flow back towards coinbase by having clients who mostly want to deposit there.
The business model that makes the most sense of all is LN wallets are centralized services that hold client (and merchant) bitcoin by default, but provide the option to set up a gateway chanel to whoever wants to create a node for security (perhaps makes sense when balance reaches $100k+ or so, (or $500 for btg... can be used as a test))
The LN wallet service can provide incentives for exchanges/large merchants to connect, and would also naturally connect to other LN wallet(services).
A gateway service business model would still most likely be one that offers diversification benefits while still holding clients' bitcoin... but this has little business profit model and high theft profit model.

OP did a good job in expanding the visible use cases.  IIUC, you can open a chanel with a gateway with a "LN balance" that lets you transact with the gateway's connections (LN world ideally), and no real reason/way for the gateway to steal your funds.

Is the act of broadcasting to main chain a signed act?  An act provably originating from a party?  (I don't think so. ie.  Yes its provable that I signed my spending transaction, but the submission to the network is anonymous)
If it somehow is, I think this invalidates one of the other suggested protection schemes:  Have friends monitor cheating for you and submit "true" txs when it is spotted.  If the origin of a transaction broadcast is not provable, then it would seem easy to frame the other side for cheating.

You're saying that LN promises better anonymity than mainchain due to routing and the lack of a final paper trail affecting channel balances.
Sybil's motivations here are to be MITM router of txs, I think to track/deanonymize payments instead of attempting to monopolize fees.  It has to be one or the other, and sybil/NSA will want to set low fees to improve its connectivity/spy powers.  That activity though would greatly enhance the transactibility/utility of the LN network where anonymity isn't essential.  Connecting to nodes that are outside the 5 eyes (Russia/china/dprk) is one method of escaping the NSA web.
I think sybil network tangles of 18 nodes between exit points would be discoverable in the network, and blog/news posts identifying them would be a thing, and so I think avoidable, and of only short term utility to NSA.
if anonymity is your main concern, then atomic swaps with monero should be a thing?
But the public node/chanel system I think is itself an attack vector.  Sybil cash making 1M routes to clog up routing calculations in addition to being assholes to ruin the LN experience.

That you for finally finding the explanation, and while it makes perfect sense, it also makes 1.0 a useless scaling solution.
enabling $500/$50 payments does nothing for decongesting the network because they are currently all priced out.
Coinbase and bitstamp would have to set up 1000/10000 channels to handle capacity, though maybe if enough of their customers also setup channels, that there is a rebalance and pump through a small pipe approach to get payments through.
Also, how many extra (milli hopefully) seconds does it take to send 10 payments of $50 through the $500 pipe?
Anyways the congestion benefits of LN have to start with exchange transactions and needs... current use cases of bitcoin instead of providing new use cases prior to blocksize increase.
The understandable explanation provided is focused on bugs, but a bigger source of disappointment will be the net fees from opening/closing channels.  Also, something that should be implemented from the outset is fee allocation paid by the closing party.  Without it, we're just asking for more LN closing transactions that congest main chain even more.
I fear that its setting up LN 1.0 for failure.

My post is just saying that explicitly:  "when a party provides the 2nd (of 2) signatures, that makes the tx suitable for broadcast."  There has to be a mechanism that makes the order of signatures known.  A simple one is that the 2nd signature includes a hash of the tx that has the first signature.  If this is incorrect, then what is the technical mechanism that fulfills knowing which party published the old state, and permitting the penalty tx.
So once 2nd signature is made, the tx must be kept secret from the 1st party.  A problem with outsourcing DDOS protection (by providing the secret to a 3rd party) is that a profit opportunity for the 3rd party exists by selling the secret to the first party.

Chanels also have limited time windows (the longer the limit, the longer you have to wait for the chanel to close out).  The open and close txs are larger than simple txs, and the close tx at least has to have a fee that is sure to get through quickly.
So as a break even, parties that send/receive 4 txs+ to other parties that send/receive 4txs+ during the chanel window (which all participants need 24hr uptime) will be able to make use of it... Basically banks and businesses settling txs.  But then why not just send/receive nearly free to coinbase accounts, and then LN between exchanges's accounts.
But just like starbucks might accept 4 credit cards, they could just as easily let you pay from 4-10 different exchanges.  The exchanges could have debit cards.  LN would still have a use between exchanges for transfers, but like they are slow to adopt segwit, they might fear more people taking funds out of them then putting funds in.

it almost always has a premium... IRA and brokerage money without need to store keys chasing a small supply.   The premium is especially large today.  
The most likely explanation beyond btc popularity, is that this is the only safe asset someone shorting futures can have included in their margin value for shorting.  If you had money on coinbase instead, if btc shoots up $10k, there might be no futures asks lower than $100k and you could be closed out catastrophically (bitfinex shitscamed but worse) even though you actually have the capital safely.

The thing about parabolic charts is that they very rarely do a V-top.  Apple, NFLIX, Amazon have had similar chart patterns.
While the chartists are quick to tell us that bitcoin is not a stock, they then use stock principles to interpret the chart, even when V-tops are unusual.
Instead of a stock chart, what if bitcoin was following an adoption curve?  Does it end at 0.1% of financial market investments?  Does it even "V drop" immediately to 0.01% of financial market investments when it reaches 0.1%?

Wall street/cnbc see btc as a threat, and spend 90% of their discussion time either getting a wall street insider to tell you bubble/blockchain, or just have their anchors say it.
They want to say I toadya so on the bubble so that you go back to giving them fees.
On the other hand, cash futures are pretty dangerous.  If I were to sell 5 btc to be delivered in Dec 2018, I'm not sure that $40k is enough, but if I'm buying, that's also way too high (might as well buy today while its under $20k).

You keep the right not to use centralized services.
Where LN will be genuinely useful is among "banks/exchanges" that allows any exchange's merchant/payment services to be used from any other exchange's.

These fork discussions are always bad, and difficult because they are bad.  A blocksize solution is needed mostly to end the fork discussions, btw.  BTC could survive somewhat stuck at 1MB forever.
I can appreciate benefits of a larger max blocksize.  But I want to make sure there is unanimity on any hard fork.  That is very difficult.
An other alternative is for you or anyone else to make BTC2.0 fork, without the hope that this altcoin trades at $400+/unit.
But this fight to make an altcoin that is the one with perceived value is the difficult problem, that is not solved with a just do something quick and simple approach.

Today, those same people found out they didn't get an allocation, and so bought back at a lower price than it was last month.

I think my guess is pretty good.  There's no reason to outbid exchange prices.  At the time of the bids june 28, the echange price was around $570-$580.  I thought it was a bit higher when I made my guess.
So, I'd revise my estimate to $550-$570.  The reason for bidding at the high range, is an ability to buy a large amount without moving the price.
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:22:44


actually it is.  Consumers should know and accept that risk, which may be in their favour just as much as not.  BTC is just a means for payment like visa/paypal, and the amount in btc just an instant conversion.

Money laundering is only a problem for those who wish to control fiat currency.  Technically, the possibility of reduced tax revenue through bartering can be considered a social loss, but the people who raise money laundering as an issue don't actually care about this second issue.
If preventing tax-free/underground sales was a predominant concern, then cash, goats and salt should be made illegal.
The problem with making cash illegal for the currency controllers is that turning currency into exclusively mandatory bank permission credits would weaken the currency.  If you cannot turn your bank permission slips into green pieces of paper, then the illusion of value behind the green paper is weakened.
The controllers of currency are both the government and banks.  An even more important protection from currency controllers than government's privilege to print unlimited currency and devaluing it, is protection from bank abuse or stupidity (remember cyprus) by maintaining the right to withdraw from holding electronic bank promises.
So, the right to launder money or goats is a critical freedom that does not really harm your fellow man in any material way.  Its the right to buy whole milk.  In the US, the 2nd ammendment is explicitly there to allow the right to "terrorism", and counterbalance "potentially" oppressive government.
Anti money laundering positions and legislation is transparent extreme fascism designed to protect and maintain fascist control from any opposition or consequences to their fascist actions.
While we would all appreciate the complete immunity from repercussions for any of our own evil acts, it takes control of a powerful nation to achieve such power.  A better protection from terrorism is to be more considerate in imposing your will, such that the victims of your will see the pursuit of happiness as preferable to suicide bombings.

The promise of a dollar used to mean that you had the right to cash it in for gold.  It is not the fractional reserve system that broke that promise it is the revoking of the convertibility promise that broke the promise.  Fractional reserve systems do incur a risk of not being able to fulfill the promise to everyone, but the promise was explicitly revoked anyway.
The article's point has little to actually do with fractional reserve.  It attacks the concept of US bonds as a claimed "risk-free" investment and proxy for the risk free interest rate.  There is always risk in every promise, which is the main reason you get paid (interest) to accept the promise.
Promises you think your government has made, but they actually haven't, is a promise to avoid hyperinflation and bankruptcy.  In the case of Detroit, it is not that they are thrilled to be bankrupt, but they did make choices in the last 20 years that were designed to keep existing benefiticaries benefacting, at the extreme risk of innevitable bankruptcy and harm to future (at that time) beneficiaries.
The effect of US bankruptcy would have the same currency effect as hyperinflation to avoid US bankruptcy.
@_date: 2014-07-19 20:27:45
I'd assume that profits only apply to currency profits.  So if an exchange charges 0.5% or whatever of bitcoin transactions that it receives in bitcoin, it is not profit yet.
It would also probably have a loophole for "market making" activities which is setting funds aside specifically for buying and selling btc.  This is ripe for loopholes, and has no term limits for the length of time it can hold btc in such accounts.
THe rule is not nearly as oppressive as the OP claims, and is actually somewhat reasonable.  You don't want farmers doubling down gambling their retained earnings that the price of wheat will double because if the gamble fails they could both wipe out their cushion, and lose money on their current crops.
The only unduly restrictive part is US dollar denominated investments.

You can shorten the download time a bit by taking a monthly snapshot that is compiled by several sources.
The bitcoind approach might have the advantage of being a simple command line to systems that you control.  So I don't see the lengthy development time argument.  
I don't know about the other apis that have been suggested here, but they appear to be a 3rd party service, which may introduce vulenerabilities that you cannot control (I don't know any of these services, and so don't know of vulnerabilities)

If you have bitcoin rather than a bank account balance, its more convenient.  Cash to bitcoin could be cheaper than cash to bank account through lb.  Using an exchange usually results in higher fees and much longer delay to getting funds into bank account.
that said, I don't really understand the fees.  Whether they are monthly total or per bill.
If it is per bill, perhaps they could so something like $1 + 1% up to $500, and 1% above that? (or better of course)

I think the futures will flop.  
What price would you be willing to lock in right now for Dec 2018?  Let's say that is $40k.
Problem 1:  No one wants to take the buy side of that.  If you are that bullish on bitcoin put $18k right now on your credit cards.  Basically, the only price a buyer is willing to pay in Dec 2018 is the 3-5% higher than today that he might earn on relatively safe investments until then.
Problem 1b: btc has no futures utility.  100000lbs of pork bellies is an illiquid asset that you might want to manage delivery in future months.  Bullish on btc?  Buy btc now.  Need to pay your cell phone bill/rent in 2 months?  Withdraw a fraction.
problem 2:  No shorting liquidity.  btc goes up 30%?  You're forced to liquidate.  The liquidation prices are going to be in the $500k to $1M/btc dec 2018 price, and the CBOE backers go bankrupt.  No one is going to be putting short orders for reasonable prices.
problem 3:  The one short trap that looks appealing is hold 5 btc, and short for $40k in 1 year.  Looks like you can lock in a good profit.  Except you need collateral independent of your 5 btc for the exchange.  If its 130%, then an initial $60k is needed.  If the contract goes to $80k, you need to come up with another $260k to not get closed out.  The contract going to $80k would imply that btc is still a fair bit less than this probably under $60k.  If you cannot independently add that money to your account, and sell your real btc for less than $60k, then you will have lost money compared to just holding.  Problem 2 amplifies this.  You could end up owing the CBOE  $100k/btc on this "sure thing" bet.

The actual argument against raising the limit is that not raising it will increase tx fees.

One reason is that the total btc to ever be mined is based on the difficulty and reward per block.

Benefit of softfork,
1. If you want to see your tx's confirm then you are forced to upgrade, and so in theory, everyone will upgrade.  Softfork is code for break all bitcoin clients until they get on board.
Risk of softfork,
Is there any way for the unhappy 49% to make a hardfork response?
Its hard to understand how a 51% fork decision is magically better than an 80% or 90% fork decision.
I'm starting to lean towards having a half-assed hard fork such that there is a bitcoin 1.0 and btc2.0 versions.   The combined value of the 2 is likely to be less than $450, and probably the right balance would be btc1 = $300 and btc2 = $100, but many would disagree with my estimate, and there's likely to be an equalization as the mining difficulty drops on one fork vs the other.
For many people, the idea of 2 currencies with lower aggregate value is a non-starter stupid idea, but its hard to understand how a softfork (forced upgrade) has no reactionary hardfork countermove that is worse than an intentional hardfork.
There would still be benefits to the 2 currencies.
btc1 - less spam, tracking effort, for likely higher tx fees. (only if txs not moved to btc2).  Possibly no effect on tx fees.  Currency to hold if you are primarily interested in store of value.
btc2 - lower tx fees, and more transaction focused currency, and wasteful blockchain message recording, and other frivolous stuff that is not universally welcome, but still useful to some.  Allows more spam.

Though a non-controversial fork in that it is simply allowing for a rule based system for spending coins out of one address.  The sidechains version of this accomplishes without a fork through multisigs.  Its unclear to me if multisig needs a "caretaker for the black hole wallet", but if sidechains works, or existing opcodes for spendall and such work, we can just use that.  No fork.
The, worst case scenario, fork is only needed to allow btcA -&gt; btc back conversion.  It can be implemented later.  Unlike blocksize changes, there is no possible ideological objection to making a wallet spendable.
Technically, if its possible for a "soft forked" miner to accept transactions from the black hole that would be rejected by a non-fork miner in such a way that the block is still buildable by a non-fork miner.  (ie a block that had invalid signature txs that was accepted, can still be part of future chains by a non-fork miner), then its possible for upgraded and non-upgraded miners to participate on the same chain.


The risk is only with loss of faith in the sidechain, and the only reason for having a btcA -&gt; btc mechanism.
My main point though, is that there is no reason to value btcA differently than btc.  The total supply of the sum of both is the same as if there was no btcA.  It is possible for a vendor to only care/value btc, but that should not the case for most people.  btcA should have lower tx fees than btc, and that may actually make it a more attractive currency to hold.
I agree though that there should be some mechanism to convert back, just to eliminate all imagined fears.
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:59:42
Its no fork because if you never want to send or receive btcA, you never have to upgrade your software.  Btc miners who don't want free money can also ignore the upgrade.
This is an ultra-simplified version of pegged sidechains.  Multi-sig sidechains implementation would be better.  (there is safety in getting btcA -&gt; btc txs) but that could aslo be done through a black hole "magic wallet" simplified sidechain trick.
btc -&gt; btcA is a tx that sends to the black hole.  To do, btcA -&gt; btc, btcA coins would be sent to its own black hole (same wallet key) address, and that would result in coins comming out of the btc black hole.
There very well may be a code upgrade for miners to be able to handle "black hole" transactions (but only for btcA -&gt; btc), but the worst that would happen is that a btcA -&gt; btc tx would be delayed until a miner with upgrade mines a block.... and there is actually no real/expected reason to move coins from btcA -&gt; btc, other than a loss of faith, so a delay is a minor issue.
I'm not against sidechains, but this proposal is simpler to implement in a provable secure manner.

I'll repeat the no logical need for btcA -&gt; btc conversion.  Its comforting paranoia proofing.
I'll also point out the no logical objection to a fork that simply permits a spending mechanism out of a black hole (that was previously funded).  Blocksize increase forks have winners and losers,  and so add controversy.  Spam txs and large block volume potentially delaying block submission and so potential to lose block reward.
There is no such downside to allowing a tx from black hole.
The fork time trigger (to allow btcA -&gt; btc) can be 6-12 months after btcA started.  It can have the ultimatum that if btc community does not accept the fork, then a hard fork is implemented, and a btc2 - btcA bidirectional relationship will exist.
Still, whether fork or no fork, it is still possible for those who don't want to bother with a larger blocksize to stay at 1MB forever, while those who want larger blocks can care about btcA.  The only difference between btc and btc2 code is that btc2 recognizes the operation of btcA -&gt; btc2.
And the entire discussion about forks is only needed if the multisig version of sidechains is not an ideal solution that works.  If sidechains works without a fork (but afaik a similarly "unobtrusive" fork is needed to redefine unused opcodes) then we can use that.


The technical challenge is only that unforked/unupgraded nodes would reject blocks accepted by upgraded nodes.  The unupgraded miner would simply not include the blackhole spend tx.  IF its possible for 51% of the network to approve a block with invalid tx signatures, but that doesn't stop the next block from a non-upgraded miner from being mined on top of that one (with txs valid), then it would allow both clients to mine the same blockchain, and no fork (completely optional upgrade) status is preserved.
@_date: 2016-01-15 00:17:31
That is indeed the core of it.  Sidechains is one way to permit this.  It wasn't clear to me before that btc miners were also mining the sidechains, and its good that there are technical solutions to this that don't require the simplifying hacks I proposed.
Its also important that there is a `btcA -&gt; btc` procedure even if it is never used.
My core proposal is that there is an "official sidechain" meant to divert transactions off the main network, that would be a no brainer for miners to adopt as it is a guaranteed easy mine to build those txs as well.
A concern with the overall sidechain proposal is that there is an unlimited amount of them, and so an unlimited amount for miners to track.
From the sidechains paper, OP_SIDECHAINPROOFVERIFY and Bitcoin Altchain concepts should be the implementation.  While there is safety in btcA -&gt; btc back conversion, the practicality should focus on btc -&gt; btcA.

see other reply for (1).  But again, if sidechains/spendall opcodes work, then use that.
for (2), a simple solution is that btcA coins are created whenever you send btc to blackhole.  The amount of btcA created is equal to btc sent, and given to the sender on the btcA chain.  The process to create back btcA -&gt; btc would also involve sending btcA to its black hole.


The btc blackhole wallet is unspendable by anyone without a soft-fork.  Acts as burned btc.  Its not possible for anyone to run off with them (and I don't understand multisig fully enough to know that a caretaker party cannot DOS the proper transfer of coins).
The miner of btcA chain does not get any rewards other than tx fees.  The btcA miner will usually be the same person who got the btc block because he can withhold publishing the winning block, and so has the secret nonce needed for quick btcA block mining.  If he doesn't mine it, then a relay node can cpu mine it in an expected 600 hash attempts (AFAIU).

Solar Bitcoin mining is an excellent way to go offgrid with good use of surplus power.
In cold climates, you also want to power a heat pump into hot water to heat at night and have reserve for cloudy/cold periods.
You want panels facing east and west too for longer mining/heating/cooling uptime.
Battery can be relatively small.  Smooths out cloudy periods.  Charges up early morning enough to bring up stable mining late morning, then charge with surplus power mid day, discharge towards late afternoon, and recharge end of afternoon.  Can get 3 "half" cycles/day out of battery keeping it in range for longevity.
In Ontario, monthly electric fee (just hookup) is now $39/month.  $9400 over 20 years.  Gas is not that bad, but still $4800 over 20 years. 
20kw of solar in DIY mode would cost $20k (each $0.41/w installed = 1c/kwh for 4.5 sun hours/day average) or so to install.  With 12kw facing south and 8kw of bitcoin miners/heating devices, and 16kwh of batteries (ideal charge/discharge rate is 1/4C or less)

I understand the idea for RBF.  If 2 txids are the same, miners get the choice of which one to add to block.
This fills a need for txs that might be stuck unconfirmed due to too low of a fee.
I've seen a bug before where a tx was relayed twice or something, and it appeared as 2 transactions, though it "worked" by accepting only one of them.
Its not clear what the current rules/procedures are for a duplicate tx.  I don't think miners are forced to reject both.
Its also confusing what happens after 48 hours.  The sender may rely on nodes dropping the relay of an old unconfirmed tx, but its unclear that a node is forbidden from broadcasting it, and so unclear what level of safety there is to "replace a payment that didn't go through" with a new tx.
Basically, I don't know what RBF actually changes if miners are already able to choose one of "double spend txs" in queue.

no blocks in last 12 hours, so no confirmations.  They should happen quicker once next (6) block comes along.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:29:38
Once there is one block that spans 12 hours from previous, the next 5 will also trigger a difficulty downgrade.  Which will bring difficulty down to 43% of current level.
It will still be messy for a long time, but that could be the only drop in difficulty until the next "normal" readjust period, even though mining it will be done for either suspcious or altruistic reasons.

its not as though viabtc couldn't find an exchange to short bch on.

Another problem is that, afaik, the fork block is one that will be &gt; 1 MB, but all of the recent blocks seem fairly small. viabtc has mined at least one small block, so if they are ones pushing for bch, it seems like the &gt;1MB rule is indeed in effect?

Could you remake the example based on the prevalence of 1 way chanels?
Lets say alice is Starbucks, and bob wants to "prepay" a $500 credit, in exchange for 20% discount.  But the ability to unilaterally take a refund for the unused balance.
In your example, does starbucks need to have $500 in btc as countertrade to make the chanel?
Bob can essentially pay Carol in starbucks credits through the bank of starbucks without opening a chanel between them.  Carol can still unilaterally withdraw her "balance" with starbucks.
Is it fair to say that LN chanels only make sense in the context of recurring payments?  Bidirectional chanels is most typically used in settlement layers.
For individual users, the main application of a LN chanel, would be a single one to their/a "btc bank".  All banks would have LN chanels among themselves, and then anyone can pay anyone on the network and offchain.
current exchanges would be motivated to be "LN banks".  Added customer security for withdrawals, but is there a LN tx that allows conversion of btc to fiat?
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:49:07


Not true.  Take a 1 second interval,
Your probability of winning is equal to finding a lucky hash times the probability that no one else found a lucky hash that second.  The same calculation applies at the trillionth of a second interval.

This is a good idea, especially to get core onboard.
LN has promise to reduce congestion and fees, and 1MB block size will give reason to adopt it.  If successful, then LN can be a solution that tides us over several years at just 1MB.  If not successful, then "2MB and done" is not a real solution.  
So if there does need to be a hard change/fork, its better to have just one event, and a solution that solves a need that exists at the time.  
Rules for dynamic expansion of the block size would seem much better than another eventual 4x hard fork for instance.
Maybe LN solves everything.  Maybe LN 2.0 solves "everything" accompanied by 2x, but maybe 2x is not needed or 4x or 8x or dynamic is.
But it will probably be at least 3 months before we can feel what the needed solution is.

interesting.  and then if the block after that took another 2 days, that would still make the last 6 blocks "too slow".
I think you are right.  I agreed with 's interpretation but that assumes there is some "reset"/non overlapping 6 block count when such reset would be difficult (or at least require flag setting) to do, and is not apparent in the code.
The part I don't get now though, is if BCC txs are invalid for btc, how will bcc ever get "started".  If the first block is in fact valid btc, then there will be a surprise "replay" spend of both btc and bcc on the fork block.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:40:59
the next block will trigger 20% difficulty easing.  I expect 2 more at least.  Depending on the price of course, I still expect that mining it will be an "altruistic" choice, but it will get blocks down to a 20 minute average, and another difficulty reset down in 2 weeks.
A fundamental problem with bch that will persist is that  there are 2-3 pools that have the power to 51% attack it, if they choose to do so.  That power and opportunity will be expanded with difficulty spikes that drive away hashing power.
Though, its reasonable to not expect shenanigans that will tank the value of whatever they might try to "steal".  Still reason to be nervous when many consecutive blocks all from same miner/pool.

Lets go with the first bad fork proposal just because its first and move on?
A problem with a bad fork is that you will now have 2 chains to track.  After the initial difficulty adjustment there will be a natural tendency for mining to get split 50/50 between the chains.
btc you had prior to fork when its spent will result in btc and xtbtc to the receiver.  That actually means 3 separate currencies.  Though any change you get will be in double new currency.
Its really important that a better consensus fork with likely slower block limit change occurs (bip 100 for example) to avoid this 8mb or nothing false forced choice.

Value of btc could very well be first for many other people too.  But it is at least very important to everyone.
I agree that low tx fees and fast confirmations are important and valuable goals.  There are proposals different than bip 101 (bip 100 for instance) that are less underhanded and politically manipulated to enhance the chance of a fork.
The politically underhanded triggers in bp 101 designed to increase artificially the chance for a fork is the main problem with bp 101.  It automatically depresses btc value by trying to fork on a weak consensus basis.
bp101 also assumes a certain future.  That no technology designed to reduce on chain transactions will ever be useful, and that growth at a transaction network is assured.
bip100 allows for a world that adapts to its realities as they occur.  Blocksize is a continuous dynamic voting process result.  Not a manipulative trick that would force another fork to change.

bch can go in a tard spiral.  The current difficulty is only 10% higher than it was last night when they had over 2EH, but only 0.74EH atm.
Tonight will be interesting.  either...
1. hash rate jumps up so that they do 30-60 blocks per hour, then hash rate leaves again for 16 to 20 hours until the next night.
2. hash rate doesn't go up for a while and difficulty drops dramatically, after which hashrate spikes and they do 90 blocks/hour for a bit then leave for 22 hours.
The btc mempool makes the bch profitability window shorter and shorter likely with a lower trend in minimum nightly difficulty.
A flaw in their DAA is that there is a minimum 12 hour time window, so if they do 144 blocks/hour causes the same DA in the first hour as if they had done 144 blocks over 12 hours.  Granted, with same hashrate, they'd only get 72 36 18 9 over the next 4 hours.
But the filters they use (limit to range of 12 to 48 hours) allow for similar gaming to previous EDA.  If everyone waits to switch over for the night, then there is a bigger group payoff for easy mining.

while at first I thought your version would be impossible, that's probably right, and its a nightmare.  When you sign a valid btc tx, its a valid xtbtc tx as well.  So the recipient of btc can replay your tx on the xtbtc network to receive those as well.  Its just new coins that will exist only on one network.
The reason this is a nightmare is that if I will perform a service for 1 btc, I'd prefer to receive 1 btc and 1 xtbtc rather than just one or the other, so a fork actually creates 3 currencies :(
Txs would also issue change in both currencies.  Once you spend old btc, it would become new btc and new xtbtc (independent).  Old btc would be much more valuable than new btc, but spending some would result in change for a much larger amount than the amount spent.


upvoted, but that part is outright false and absurd.  You're assuming that xtbtc has the support of miners, when they are the ones most likely to oppose it.  Either way though, If one chain has fewer miners, then its difficulty will adjust to be easier.


I really doubt there will be unanimous consensus that btc must be destroyed while we all enthusiastically embrace the fork.  It makes more sense for all parties to hedge their bets and keep old btc.  There's going to be resistance to this plan even if coinbase is in favour of it.


Is that the 8mb plan?

after the fork happens, electrum servers will pick a "winner" for you.  They haven't implemented code yet to handle &gt;1mb blocks, so the winner they choose might be btc core.
Depending on what nodes decide, spending money may or may not reach both chains.  Either way you will need to get a new wallet for tracking the "loser" chain.
the price of btc and xtbtc will be different as they will be different currencies.  There will be inconsistency in spending in that some coins will get transferred to both btc and xtbtc, and others won't.  Depending largely on the node network.
@_date: 2015-08-18 06:03:10


Yes they would all be forks.
The resistance I see to 8mb and 8gb is that there will be no reason for tx fees, and the white paper design was that tx fees was supposed to become the dominant mining revenue item.
Alternate proposals are dynamic difficulty based on block size saturation with smaller gradual increases that still allow for a market for tx fees.

Wouldn't it be easier to get 75% or 90% with a smaller and more gradual procedural ramp up.  My main problem with xt is that its a stupid suboptimal needlessly extreme solution.  If xt is an option, why can't 9 other better options also be considered for forks?
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:14:43


The option means, one day I'd want cold storage and could do it.  When I sell bitcoin to people, I tell them of the possibility of it being fully contained on your computer but not forgeable.  You may prefer the convenience of hosted or light wallets, but doing so exposes you to theoretical attacks on light wallets, or more serious attacks on hosted ones.
Laypeople will say stuff like didn't the bitcoin ceo get arrested in Japan?  People lost money in their hosted wallets with him, and one defense is to keep the reference client and data on your computer, even if light wallets have shown to be ok so far.


75% is the fork criteria.  If someone offers you $1 for those bitcoin, you would rather throw them away?  Then maybe others can get $2 for theirs.  Then maybe bitcoin core and xt makeup and old bitcoins will be counted as equal value, and they are all $200-$300 again.... because hey, we just made one bs fork, why not make some funner ones?

@_date: 2015-08-18 15:44:29
BIP 100 (what I understand xt to be based on) is not that bad after reading it.
Its actually not a decision between 8mb and 1mb.  Its a proposal that sets the block size limit to the lowest 20th percentile accepability.  ie if 2000 of the last 10k blocks set a desired limit of 1mb, then there is no change.  If in the sorted list of last 10k desired limits, 1.1mb is in 2000th place, then that becomes the new limit.
Its fairly reasonable as is, but it could also be tweaked further to be more conservative somehow.

Well, then someone should do xt2 right away that adopts bip100 instead.  Its so much more sensible.  Can even be modified to be reversible, or satisfy policy compromises.  It also ensures that it is a winning fork, and remains a winning fork.  If you really want a smaller block size you can fight within the system to vote for low block sizes.
is btcore against bip100?  Is anyone?
The reason bip100 is really good is that miners would want to set a block size that is sustainable.  Doing so encourages more mining to join when blocks are late (compared to 10 minute avg) and have many tx, and if some tx spillover into the next block then keep mining to cover the relatively unlucky situation of finding a block quickly that has few txs.

btc had a very recent difficulty adjustment.  The mining attack was this weekend when "free" bch could be mined.  Bch is going to later today start getting a stable hash rate.  Possibly in the 20%-25% range.
Its likely that btc averages 6 or so blocks per hour for the next week and a half, but then both chains are likely to be 6/hour from hereon out.  btc fees will attract hashrate.
Selling is not an attack.  Hashrate manipulation is.  But btc fees is protection against hashrate exodus.

That is not at all guaranteed.  If anyone continues to mine btc it will live on, and your coins exist in both chains.  Spending old coins goes to both chains, and change is received in both chains.  
"New coins" (received and change txs) exist independently on each chain.  
Here's a scenario,
Lets say NSA Russia China would like to destroy bitcoin.  They start mining and support xt, but the intent is just to troll the vote, and shoot up the difficulty.
After the fork, the difficulty is sky high on both chains, but there is only 30% of real miners on each chain (60% in all NSA quits its trolling having accomplished its fork goal), and so there is 30 minute confirmation times on both chains.  Until difficulty resets.  Both chains will continue mining independently.  You have a confusing mix of 2 coins, you don't know how to completely differentiate them.  You have to follow 2 chains, 2 wallets.  Everything that was bad about the useless cruft of 8mb blocks is made much worse by doubling the storage/tracking size.
Unless you are sure that "old btc" are forever worthless at the time of the fork, you don't want to give them up.

exactly.  they will be 2 separate things/chains.  75% of miners (at one moment in time) is not a threshold that wishes out of existence all user expectations or other miners.  The mining difficulty will drop way down on original fork (and new fork will have problems).  btc might softpatch a difficulty adjustment factor that patches the next block more quickly.
What is sure to happen is that the total market value of both coins will be less than current btc.  The more fucking stupid and rushed and politically manipulated the fork is, the more permanent value destruction will occur.

kraken has usdt/usd pair.  This news has created a volume spike, but its holding at 97c.  volume &gt; market cap though usually its about the same as market cap.
Anyways, thether has published audit results a few months ago.  Its probably involved in the buy side for kraken, though the business model is based on high cashout fees.

There's plenty wrong with that.  If you wanted to have just a 6mb/hour node/self hosted wallet, you now have to track an additional up to 48mb/hour chain.  You probably need computer upgrades for your cold storage.  Or trust hosted and backup systems.


Except this is a giant evil stupid cloud.  BIP 100 is still a fork proposal, but much more reasonable and less divisive.  Allows blocksize to be more adaptive, but give time to adapt to the spam levels.  Instead of a threat that weighs down btc price, it would adapt in the face of opportunities that will raise btc prices.
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:54:59
That will be messy.  If XT sets the same difficulty rating as core, then after its first block mined/forked, both sides will have ridiculously long confirmation times.  XT would be more susceptible to 51% attack.
A better criteria for a fork would be the first 4MB block instead of making a 1.001mb block.  (4MB would happen because several blocks in a row hit 1MB and the extra tx's get delayed until 4MB worth gets accumulated).
**THE BEST FORK PROPOSAL IDEA:**
If a block of 1mb size is mined, the difficulty for the next block is adjusted down 1% (temporarily).  If the block after that is also 1MB, then there will be another 1% temporary difficulty adjustment drop.  As soon as a block under 1mb is mined, the difficulty goes back to its unadjusted level.
What this would do is reduce the expected time for a new block to be mined in, and so reduce its expected size.
Could also add that the btc mining reward is also adjusted down 1%.

I agree with and understand that.  If I have 10 btc now, after fork, I will have 10 btc and 10xbtc.  
Yes I can spend 10 xbtc, and you only receive 10 xbtc.
We will all follow both chains.
One way this could be "good" is if you want to spend/recieve dust many times, you will want to use the lower tx fee xbtc, and this will reduce the block sizes of btc.  It will add confusion though.

But that is the right answer.  If 20% don't mind a small (or large) blocksize increase then it goes up, and there is no reason for them to be upset and fight the fork.  
The votes are actually public, and pool membership will reflect attitudes and PR.  If we all mostly agree that some blocksize increase will be needed in future, then in that future, the agreement will be stronger, and you will expect reasonable blocksize votes to dominate.
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:24:22
thanks for answer, but there are several issues.
It confirms that old coins exist on both chains.  And so can be spent independently.


Then the difficulty on the 25% side would drop drastically, until confirmation times are quick again.


Its not obvious that they wouldn't support both.  Its especially not obvious that support of one side is a permanent decision.
Also whatever the initial support level for one side, it would gravitate towards 50% for each, because the "losing side" will have more effective contributable hashing power.
The core issue with a large increase in block size is that without it, transaction fees would naturally increase as people have to compete to fit into the next block.  And miners would prefer this.  Users would prefer low tx fees.
A better (more unanimity in acceptance) fork is a slow gradual programmed ramp in blocksize.

Its a risky move to attack bitcoin this way.  But one part of your analysis is right:
People will dump one side of the fork, after it.  Some will choose the wrong branch to dump.  It will be riskiest to go against the majority, but risky either way, so likely both sides will lose value... but in the case of bch, btc didn't even hiccup, and bch value held up until exchanges opened up deposits.

not quite yet.  difficulty did drop to 1600s, there was no 2.5 EH attraction, but there was a near 2EH for a while.   Difficulty is going back up, and though fork.lol doesn't show it, there was only 1 block last hour and a half.
So, I think peak low difficulty may drift down again tonight as profitability edge is much better on btc chain.
You're right that it stabilized for a while, but it did so by overhashing, which will lead to underhashing soon, and an overall downward spiral in average hashing.

in 2017 wnet 9k to 18k in not much over 9 days.  Then to $13k, before new highs 2 weeks later.  THere was downside resistance at $12k for several months.
Conservative growth estimates are for 25%/year (for 100% every 4 years due to halving hashrate) + 10%/year for utility growth and fiat race to the bottom.
$18k target is easy.  But with conservative growth, $30k high and then $20k support also seems easy.
$100k (to hope for $300k-$500k) needs to start having central bank adoption talk, IMO... or just major fomo.

An important goal of a fork should be to not require any more forks in the event that it is a failure.  Too large a block size might expose the network to 51% mining attacks.
The good thing about bip100 is there is no reason not to accept it.  No reason to abandon it after it has been accepted either.  A miner can work within the system to vote for smaller blocksize limits.

I don't know.  90% of users would prefer not to be forced to "upgrade" too.
If many accept the need for a larger block size, I don't see why we have to go straight to 8mb.  Most users would at least like the option of having bitcoin on their home network/PC too.
100% of users would like there to be just one chain.
One downside of say even multibit/electrum server-chained wallets is that you will need some tricky process to find your coins on whatever chain those services choose to ignore.

Thats a reason for bip100 instead of bip101.  BIP101 assumes we need large and expandingly large at a fixed rate blocksize.  BIP100 gives us the blocksize we need/want based on actual demand as it happens.

But it wouldn't be double spend.  if you have 10 btc, the moment after the fork you have 10 btc and 10 xtbtc.
regarding miners, I'm not completely sure that if they find a hash solution to btc, they can not also submit it to xtbtc, and so get 25 of each.  From a mining perspective, a node that sees a btc solution, could post that solution faster than the miner to xtbtc, and that could make them diverge?  If the same miner posted a solution to both, then I think the problem for each chain would be identitical and so miners could contribute to both.

The $8T gold market cap is almost entirely its hodl value (jewelry is hodl value too).  Central banks being the biggest parties.  btc has better holding value because it has better security, transportability, and liquidability.

I, or someone more retarded, can fork the US government, and declare it better.  Demand that all taxes and laws flow to my control, and all military obey my command.  Ultimately, the success of this fork depends on key people accepting it, not just proving (as difficult as that would be) that it is better.
I did not say that core must be protected forever as "defining what bitcoin is".  But some resistance to every tard declaring any new fork as official should also exist, because if it doesn't, more tards will attack bitcoin.

I'd argue that the 2nd amendment is fundamentally a right to violently oppose the US government.  That doesn't mean the government is forced to welcome opposition, but the spectre that guns might be used by terrorists or criminals is not a pretense to ban them.
That has to be the core reasoning for the 2nd amendment, and needs to be clarified that the freedom to bear arms should extend to the freedom from persecution for having income or assets that can be fantasized to have links supporting  treason, dissent, insurrection or terrorism.
The government must abandon minority report authority to fantasize precrime intent to activities, income or assets.  The constitutional grounds for forbidding such abuse is the 2nd amendment.  The right to bear arms extends to the right to not be on drone attack lists for the possibility of having arms.

BIP100 is the right general framework for blocksize increase.  There definitely should not be a hard (fork needed) size cap.
The best thing about bip100 is that blocksize support is continuous.  So there is no reason to reject the fork, as its changes are automatically fixable.
As far as a simpler adjustment mechanism.  The maximum adjustment could be 50% up and 25% down each 3 months, and then at 32MB or higher, the maximum adjustment could be cut down to 25% or less per 3 months.

1.  I assume that no one has to close until regulations/licensing terms are proposed, and a reasonable time frame will be included to apply/comply.

the danger of a 51% attack is that of a double spend.  You have to worry if the Chinese government pays you $50M or so in btc, and you give them something of value before a lenghty number of confirmations, that includes non-government mined blocks.
This is relatively unlikely.  If they were trading it for cash, there would either be an exchange or counterparty contract, and the double spend would be equivalent to payment being NSF.
Basically, as long as you are not doing a multimillion$ drug or illicit weapons deal with the Chinese gvt, you wouldn't have anything to worry about.

Weakening the threshold to lower it back towards 1mb towards 51% would be ok.  I had understood that the blocksize was always set to what the bottom 21st percentile supported.
I'm not sure how I feel about 80th percentile required to lower the blocksize.  The good aspect is that it offers blocksize stability, but if a blocksize increase turns out to be an "invade Russia in the winter" decision, this means there is no woopsy easy undo button.

This analysis is wrong.  The current price of btc reflects the expected/possible bcc value.  So, if bcc went from $400 to $0, from metcalfe law, btc would rise by more than $400 including its network effect multiplier.
There's a good chance for $400 increase if bcc goes to $100.
@_date: 2015-11-30 17:06:44
The 2 forks will exist.  You will have coins that have some value on both forks.  The expected value assuming btc is $400 prior to fork, and 75.01% support bip101, is that non bip101 will be worth $100/btc and bip101 will be worth $300/btcxt.
What is economic suicide is being sure that bip101 if triggered is guaranteed to be the only relevant fork forever.  bip100 is just better.  Its dangerous to push anything other than the least controversial solution.
Even if bip101 gains more unanimity than 75.01%, there's still going to be value in core coins.  It will mean tracking double the chain size (2 blockchains) without including increased block size.

What if the transaction hash simply had an "implied" BCC  (3 char string) "salt" as part of the hash input?
If BCC doesn't do it, could BTC do this "easily"?... as part of segwit update?
One way for btc to do this as an optional softfork update, is to first try to validate transaction with "btc" salt added, and if it fails, backgrade to old unsalted hash.  
This would provide replay protection for those who upgrade.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:22:38
to bad for bch.  This likely kills the coin at birth.  It requires mining at significant loss for weeks, only to get those who finally get their txs confirmed to dump the currency, and then have competing miners join in when difficulty finally gets too easy... and so no real reason for initial miners to invest early losses.

I understand why bcc did the dynamic difficulty decrease.  If they didn't, they might suffer months at 1 block per several hours.  TIL, its only dynamic downward.
For gaming the system, this will encourage near 0 mining at open, or while difficulty is too hard, followed by potentially 1 block per second if there is extreme gaming, and extreme price drop, but likely under 1 block per minute.
This will likely cause bcc price to tank, as a result of the joke policy, and so less hash power devoted to it.
But its right to express concern that btc hash power could drop a bit, though hopefully stay well above 4 blocks per hour.

500k is $7.5T.  A bit less than the value of all gold.  While btc is more useful than gold, and has innovation potential to increase utility, the main reason gold is worth that much is that central banks store it to help pretend their fiat is worth something, and to potentially import food, energy, or weapons with it if their fiat loses credibility.  Bitcoin is more useful than gold for these purposes, and central banks understanding this is what will drive price to $500k+.

after the fork, each chain is like its own altcoin.  Sure there will be confusion whether you are spending or receiving btc1 vs btc2.
Are you saying that if the software is unchanged, if I spend btc1, then the receiver knows how to spend btc2 to the same address by replaying my btc1 address signature?
That would be a nightmare inconvenience, but there is still a simple workaround of "sweeping" every wallet into new wallets for each chain.  Basically the only one interested in replaying your first sweep would be yourself.
A better simple solution would be any slight change to the transaction details being signed, by the forked chain/coin, including if necessary, the simple addition of string `btc2`.

It is prudent for merchants to trade out most of its btc holdings.  It could either use bitpay's guaranteed liquidation service, or it could place its own sell order a few points above the bid, and on a normal day may make a few extra $ trading the spread itself.

Actually, lag would only advantage someone that wants to do a very big trade either buy or sell, but wants to make sure that bids and asks aren't cancelled while the trade executes.
If you want to sell 30k btc, it would drop the price back down near $100, and might take a few ms to fully execute all the orders.  If there was no lag, some people might cancel their bids in time, or other sellers could quickly dump their shares as well.
So lag causes the price to be more "stable" than less lag

What is very good about the latest Chinese miner announcements is that they are putting their faith in core, and a reasonable path from segwit 1.
AFAIU, not only does segwit 1 nearly double chain capacity, it also enables off-chain txs which frees much more capacity.  So, the need for scaling beyond this should not have any near term emergency.

My needs include providing a security system for others, hence the concern about password choices, but also the realistic need to make the password memorable.
The importance of a slow (5h/s or so) decryption process are that if the "favorite 3 numbers" are compromised, then a dictionary attack is feasible, though potentially too costly for reasonable estimates of perpetuity.  Without the computer compromise, brute force is impossible.


3 favorite numbers from 0-255, is 16.7M increased search space.  If the password needs to be convenient enough to type in several times per day or per hour, then a 4 character password might still provide adequate security for low value "wallet".

electrum limits it to 12 words from a 1000 or so poetry list.  It acts like a 12 character password from a 1000 letter alphabet.
There is one neat feature about it is that it allows derived subwallets and change addresses that can be shared without divulging the master key.
While that feature isn't useless,  its not obviously useful to everyone either.
IMO the best paper wallet if you don't need that feature would involve sha256(secret brain password hash(paper phrase that includes non dictionary words)) where the internal hash function does not need to be sha256 (could be sha512 or scrypt, or scrypt(sha512()) ).  The brain password can be relatively short.

There is a good point you didn't quite make in your comment.  Joules/W are already a microtransaction currency.  They can indeed be converted to "money" (btc).
At 12c/kwh, a joule, is 1/300k of a cent. or 300 satoshis if btc = $100.  So, everything you do on your computer costs you satoshis.
It also means that excess solar/wind power could be used to make money if your utility company can't/won't buy it.


That is the good point you did make.  Because energy can be converted into btc much more directly than fiat, it does make sense to hedge energy prices to it.

I understand that several services will do the conversion for a fee.  Certainly for some users, getting Euros is worth the fee, but for others, especially those payers who might start with bitcoin (miners, or foreigners who's usual access to Euros is expensive, or people that spend and receive flattr) the conversion fees would be unwelcome.

as a miner you gain the option of either paying .15c/kwh or transfering the risk of what 0.00001 btc is to the electric company.
If your mining hardware expects to produce 1 btc month at electric cost of $100, if you expect btc to rise, then you will make more money if paying in btc direct to hydro has less cost than transfering to fiat/deposit/billpay.  If btc does not rise, then you would have paid cash anyway.

I think its unreasonable to expect that 10k coin wallets will get a sudden urge to convert it all in cash in one setting.
1. They can eat and drink all they want while liquidating small amounts.
2. If they want a yacht or ferrari or mansion or 10 of each, they would likely do better by trading btc to the sellers directly.  For any market price of bitcoin, a seller may likely accept a 20% or 30% premium to be paid in a large amount of bitcoin over cash.
3. There are buyers who want to get $1M+ in btc, but don't like the lack of anonymity of exchanges, or don't want to drive the price up buy buying directly on them.  The point is that these people exist and other people can introduce them, and an off market off-price transaction can occur.

Well at one point today, btc was trading under $60, and as I write this its over $100.

You still should cash in most of your sales just to be safe, but you could have placed your sell orders all the way up.

that analysis was fairly poor.  Here is mine
**btc vs. tuplips and diamonds.**
tulips and diamonds while very pretty can both be produced "synthetically" so there is a necessary cap on their value.   If their price rises, more are created.
Gold needs to be dug out of the ground.  More is dug when the price rises above inflationary costs.
btc on the other hand is fairly immune to increased supply as the value rises.  More mining resources means fewer btc/miner.
**storage safety**  
It is theoretically safer and cheaper to store bitcoin, though gold and diamonds are more resiliant to fire.  OTOH, its easier to misunderstand the safety requirements.
**Other considerations**
Its easier to cross a border without bitcoins being seized than with any other store of value.  Easier to ship/transfer the value.  Easier to safely keep within reach during travel.
More merchants and people are willing to accept btc than any non-fiat store of value alternative.  The dealer economy is not as needed for btc than gold, and so storage and transaction costs are significantly lower.

They are definitely using GPUs as reference.  1.5 Mhash/J/s.  Shiipping ASICS can do 60x to 100x better


definitely a real issue.  In the case of GPU/CPU, only the variable (energy) costs are relevant if you needed that hardware anyway.  For ASICs, the hashrate/difficulty has gone up 20x in 3 months, and so there is indeed extreme uncertainty of meeting the payback period.

This should be a strong overall approach:
generate a deterministic key using sha256 that becomes your encrypted key (suitable for paper and computer backup).
repeatedly hash that key with an appended brain password.  Its not a huge difference whether you use scrypt or enough SHA512 rounds.  The disadvantage of scrypt is that asics are being developed for it as a result of litecoin popularity, and relatively minor, it doesn't have cross platform precompiled libraries.
SHA256 and xor do have existing or easy asic implementations.
A greater risk than imperfect entropy is dictionary attacks.  What I like to use for the purpose of transfering a secret to myself is an added "3 favorite byte size numbers" that are input on any computer that wants the secret, and are used to transform and extend the brain password, that renders any brute force search for the password immune to dictionary attacks, and increase in likely entropy per password byte from 26/62 to 256, if the attacker does not possess the 3 favorite numbers.  (would not possess them if they intercept network traffic for your encrypted key transmission or find your paper wallet).

Why would the value of btc / transaction mean something is wrong?
Lets assume the value of cash is constant.  As the number of transactions goes up, then the value of cash / transaction decreases, and I understand that this means that the value of cash increases because people are happy to use it.  But its the latter that is relevant.  The "real" value of btc increases as transactions go up.
Lets take land or gold.  If the value of land goes up on a per sq. foot basis, but the number of sales doesn't change, it doesn't mean that the real value of land is different than the value of land.  If the value of land triples, then it doesn't mean that transactions for land have to triple in order to say it is not a bubble.

IF you know the exact exchange rate at the time you pay, it could be cheaper than wire fees, or converting cash from another currency you have, and if you expect btc to go up in 5-6 days, then better for you to sell then when your bill is due, rather than now, and wait out time for transfer.

The point is to buy something for btc at a fair price.  You could instead sell at the bid price on Mt.gox and pay a fee to mtgox, then pay a wire transfer fee, then 3 days later buy the thing.
It could be a win-win for buyer and seller to trade at exactly the mtgox bid price, if the alternative is for the seller to pay bank/credit processing fees.  The seller saves 2%-3%, and that compensates him for his risk in holding btc until he can trade them.

Is there a possible interpretation that does not allow a merchant to accept bitcoin even if he prices goods in a "real" currency?
Can you walk me through why that impression would be wrong?

I interpret it as, today's legitimate value if there is 1% penetration in 10 years.

Nearly everyone can read USD and have an idea how much money that is.  While that is true for the world, and USD has stable value, it is much easier for anyone to just convert at the last second from btc.
I believe it is a horrible idea today to quote prices/goals in btc, because the buyer actually has no idea how much he is paying, and the seller probably incurred costs in fiat, and so needs to think of what he is receiving in fiat.


It actually needs to just be accepted as a means of exchange.  No real stability is essential for that, though its always nicer if the price is about the same as it was yesterday.

You can look up US federal gold reserves (fort knox official claim of 147.2 million oz. troy).  btc would need the value of about 10oz to hit that milestone.

vid cards can do over 500M sha256 h/s.  One of my low end processor cores does 40k/s in J.


I'm a bit puzzled why you are working with the base 59, rather than hex/byte version of the keys.

that's exactly why its fair to add in a risk premium "commission"

That is another question.  What happens to balance remaining after 100 transactions?
My question though is if my real wallet has 10M BTC, but my only backup says it has 10.0001M BTC.  Are all 10M btc lost?
