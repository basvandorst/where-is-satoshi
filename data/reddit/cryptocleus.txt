What does scaled by log n mean in this case?
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:36:47
Can you explain what that means? I’m not sure how to even begin thinking about a problem like this.

I think it was probably Hal and Nick working together. Keep in mind that even if they weren’t afraid to have their name out there, in the spirit of decentralization they might have chosen to stay anonymous.

The point is I’m not interested in a discussion with an account impersonating a notable person
