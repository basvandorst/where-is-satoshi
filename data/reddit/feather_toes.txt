So, let's say you open a channel. And you make five transactions, and then they make five transactions, and then you make five. And then they decide to publish transaction  to the blockchain. And you catch it in time.
So, you publish the most recent transaction, 
But couldn't the miners just process  and ignore what you tried to get them to process? Miners tend to try to publish as many transactions as they can, but there's no guarantee about them getting to a particular transaction or not.

If a coffee maker says "Not for commercial use" that tells me the product is not durable. If I owned a coffee business or otherwise made coffee all day, every day, having a reliable coffee maker would matter, and I'd rather buy something that would work than deal with having to return the product all the time. But as a home user that makes coffee maybe once a week? Eh, the cheap piece of junk might be good enough.
Considering Nvidia seems to be ok with blockchain mining, which really runs cards hard, the "no machine learning" thing can't be a matter of durability.

I phrased my question wrong. I understood that it was timelocked. I meant, after  has been published AND mined. If you saw that and posted  in response, there would be no guarantee that the miners would mine  before the timelock ended. So what do you do?
But... you're saying my response would not be to override  with  and get my money back, but to punish the other guy, taking his money away and giving it to the miners?
How does the penalty transaction work? Do you have to prove that a more recent transaction was signed than the one on the blockchain, or can either party force a penalty regardless?
Do potential penalties have to be agreed upon and signed off on before the coffee transactions are started, or can either party unilaterally decide how much a penalty should be, and just post it?
So, let's say I open a channel with a bar. I put in 50, and the bar puts in 0. I make 10 transactions at 2 each. Instead of settling, the bar decides to make a penalty transaction and send my 50 to the miners. Could the bar do that?
Or, let's say after those ten transactions, the bar settles with  I decide I don't like the bar, and use a penalty to send the 20 I gave the bar to the miners, keeping my 30. Could I do that? Could the bar then retaliate and send my remaining 30 to the miners via a penalty? Or is it "first penalty wins"?
Or, would it be that, if I post  then for the bar to post a penalty, they would have to post  to prove that a penalty was warranted?

Bitcoin is the one from which the other coins derive. Currencies aren't like web browsers where you jump from one to the next as you find the one with the features you like best. A currency has to be something you can stick with long term for it to be valuable. If Bitcoin crashes and burns, the other coins will be seen as something that can't be stuck with long term, either.
However, if some other currency crashes and burns, Bitcoin will still be able to hold on because "that other coin was just riding off of Bitcoin's popularity and never counted in the first place."

That there's a programmed in set amount of Bitcoin in existence that people could count on not changing on a whim is indeed PART of why people bought into Bitcoin. If that were it's only attractive property, it would not have drawn in so much interest.
That you could have an asset that could not be frozen or taken from you, was another part.
That there was the potential to eventually be able to buy things online without going through Paypal, was another part.
You are discounting the other parts as if they are no longer relevant. Maybe to newbs who heard about it in the news who are now getting interested in it for the first time, those other parts aren't, but to people who've been "into it" from a ways back before it became a mainstream fad, Bitcoin having a use as a medium of exchange is critical to them placing any value in it.

Tell her it's not a stock. There's no company to go out of business and permanently tank its value. Bitcoin can be used to buy things online without having to go through Paypal, where you would be at risk of your account being frozen if Paypal doesn't like what you're selling.
Because of its utility, Bitcoin will always be valuable to someone. 
Well, until everyone loses their private keys, anyway. But that could be decades from now if not longer. Especially as more people take the risk seriously and develop better ways to mitigate it. Some companies actually have come up with some, like one has a way to store your private key with little metal letters so they can't be damaged by hard drive crashes, fire, or water, I forget what it's called.

If something wants to supplant Bitcoin, it'll have to have a lot going for it, not just be a marginal improvement. Maybe after enough coins with useful features come out, someone will pick the best ones and integrate it into a brand new coin that eventually beats out bitcoin. But the current crop of coins is mostly the same with slight tweaks. Such as some which make GPU mining practical, whereas with Bitcoin at this point you'd need an ASIC, etc.
There's a couple with interesting features, though. I don't know how Iota works, but from what I understand to pay fees with that you verify two transactions that aren't yours. So, instead of spending money, you're spending a little processing power, but not too much. So, something that eliminates miners and transaction fees would be something. And I heard of one coin (forget the name of it) that can somehow keep track of transactions without anyone knowing where which coins get sent to who. Which seems... weird. But if they can come up with a way for people to spend money they do have while preventing them from spending money they don't all the while making sure no one knows who's sending money to who, that would be something I'd be interested in.
As far as coins being saturated... what's limiting bitcoin is limiting other coins, too - hard drive space and internet bandwidth. More coins might proliferate in response to this (50 coins with 1MB blocks are easier to manage than 1 coin with 50MB blocks), but it's not going to cause bitcoin to comparatively fall out of favor, since that's a limitation they all face.

Since when has jewelry been a practical use? Jewelry isn't practical, it's pretty. People like gold because it's pretty.
Silver is ok, but it's not as pretty as gold, so gold tends to be more valuable.
Is imagining owning something which is pretty enough? Some people buy gold certificates, so I guess so. I wouldn't, because to me the point of buying gold is to have something physical in your possession that's not subject to devaluation due to the whims of the money printing press. If I'm trusting what's written on paper, why not just stick with bonds? Gold certificates can be printed just as easily as fiat regardless of how much gold actually exists, so it's not really a hedge against it.
If Bitcoin has no use/buying things with it isn't practical, then it's like a stock without a corporation. People will buy stocks even if they don't pay dividends because they think the value will go up. I think, if the company isn't paying out, then you're trading rocks and stock certificates are worthless. But for some reason they remain popular anyway. 
As long as people are willing to pump money into worthless non-dividend paying stocks all the while imagining it's valuable, then I guess there's no reason people wouldn't continue to play with Bitcoin even if it were utterly useless.

Oo! [Aubrey de Grey did an AMA]( not long ago! The SENS Foundation is small right now (at least compared to the big guys like the Red Cross), so that kind of money would make a huge difference in their ledger. Here's a video explaining what they're about: [Rejuvenation Biotechnology: The Fourth Age of Gerontology - Aubrey de Grey - RB2016]( (19min 53sec).
Tl;Dr: It's a new area of study in medicine: Repairing the damage from the process of aging itself before it gets to the point of pathology and disease. We could live healthier for longer. Aging affects all of us, so any research into this area helps all of us.
Aubrey de Grey is the "face of the organization" as it were, and gives talks about the basic principals a lot. He's been doing these talks for some years, the way he explains it makes sense, and he seems invested in making this successful - a great talk to listen to! 
Aubrey has categorized looking at the problem like this: - Altering metabolism to prevent damage from occurring. This is difficult, because metabolism is a complicated system and you can't expect to find a simple solution. - Dealing with the diseases of aging after the damage has led to pathology. This is how gerontology currently works, with treating things like Alzheimer and whatnot. - Repair the damage as it accumulates, like doing preventative maintenance on a car. This is what he's putting the most emphasis on. Currently not many people are researching in this area, and therefore needs more people addressing it, and is what the SENS Foundation focuses on.
Aubrey says what he sees as the 7 types of damage that accumulates over time, and that by categorizing them like that, it breaks the problem into something manageable. They are: Cell loss/cell atrophy, division -obsessed cells, death-resistant cells, mitochondrial mutations, intracellular waste products, extracellular waste products, and extracellular matrix stiffening.
Besides that, nice picks, dude! :D The EFF have been on my mind lately, as I'm figuring they're gonna be the big guns going to court to have the FCC's decision overturned if they vote for Pai's plan tomorrow. If anyone can take the FCC on in that arena, it's them!

Aw, hell. I thought they invested in it. It turns out the funds were seized. 
The whole point of bitcoin was that, while there's the risk of hackers or a failed hard drive/forgetting your password causing you to lose all your coins, that the government wouldn't be able to take it from you. It's weaknesses made me feel that while it wouldn't be a *replacement* for fiat, it's key strength would certainly make it worth *diversifying* in.
If they're seizing that much, then it must be a more difficult attack to protect oneself from than I realized.

That's why that explanation was the best way. The "ad" is clearly refusing to tell you how to actually buy them. 
I *guess* they could have talked about exchanges, but then they'd have to go into the history about how they sometimes get [hacked]( and then mention all the other ways to get coins, like setting up a mining farm or locating someone who owns bitcoin and selling goods or services to them, and that would have made the bit long and complicated and left out any future ways to buy bitcoin or any current ways the writers were unaware of.
Besides, the point of bitcoin isn't how you buy it, which can change arbitrarily, the point of bitcoin is how it works, which explaining how it's purchased would have taken away from.

I've never done it before. But. You need: A hard drive the same size or larger than the drive you want cloned, and some cloning software. I do not know which software are good. I'm sure they come with instructions.
If I was going to clone the drive myself, I would pick a different drive I owned and practice with that first. But honestly, with that much money at stake I'd hire a reputable professional.
To ensure there's no confusion, in addition to using the term, I'd use the definition when talking about what service I'm requesting. [PCmag]( phrases it decently: "A clone is a direct copy, bit for bit, so that the data stored on the cloned drive is identical to the data on the original drive. From the operating system to the hidden directory files, from your desktop to the device drivers, everything is copied identically. Swap the old drive out for a freshly made clone and there should be no functional difference."

How many hours does it take to explain what Bitcoin is to someone who's never heard of it before?
If this guy has been talking to his parents about Bitcoin every day for the past four years and they "get" what it even is and that it's actually worth something, then sure he can go ahead and tell them that "It has a lot of Bitcoin on it, it's worth a lot." But if not:
That he knows some computer nerd looking for a specific make and model of a hard drive for some computer nerd reason, and who's willing to pay a couple hundred bucks for one, is a plausible story. But you don't want to say that the drive is worth that much generally, because then the parents might try to sell it on eBay themselves. So you say you know a specific guy who wants that specific item.

Just have it agreed on which block numbers include the snapshot so that there aren't 60 different versions of them all a few blocks off from each other making the ledger harder to reconcile.

K, just looked up side chains. Question: In Bitcoin can you provide information in a transaction besides the to and from address? Like... some code so that the side chain knows where that transaction is supposed to go to? If you can that solves half the problem I see.
Let's see if I've got this... You could set up a bitcoin address. Then code up your side chain so that whenever money is deposited to that bitcoin address, new money is created in the sidechain, and if it's possible to provide the extra information, it can automatically be sent to the correct sidechain address.
So, money going into the sidechain can be a trustless system.
But let's say you want to take money out. So, you send your sidechain money to a specific address on the sidechain for "outgoing", and include where on the bitcoin blockchain you want your money to go. So far so good.
But now you have to rely on that the person who owns the bitcoin address is both honorable and has that address set up securely to automatically distribute funds to the address indicated. So, for funds going out it's not really a trustless system. It would be more like putting your money into paypal or a bank.
It's an interesting idea, sure, but doesn't quite solve the problem of needing more bitcoin-style (trustless) transactions.

While you can't expect them to hold onto furniture or whatever, lawyers will hold onto letters to kin along with your will, won't they? If yes:
Use multisig addresses. Give kin half of the address now, teaching them how to use and secure it. If they ever lose their address, they are instructed to contact you to give them the backup.
The other half, you put it into a letter with the lawyer, and a copy in the safety deposit box. If the lawyer's office burns down, the coins can be retrieved through the safety deposit box. If the bank burns down, the key can be recovered through the lawyer.
If the lawyer or bank tries to abscond with your unencrypted keys, it is useless to them as your kin has the other half required to access them.

Does it connect to the internet? What about secretly via wifi? The second question is, how good is its random number generator? Is your private key something the manufacturer of the device knows, or is the key properly generated on-device? Better yet, can you input your own private keys? Get out some high-end 20-sided dice and get going generating those. Next, when you want to make a purchase, how does it give you the information you need? Is there a display on the device you can read so you can type it out on your computer without connecting it to anything, or do you have to hook it up to a different machine to get the codes? If the latter, as long as you don't hook it up to a machine that uses the internet, you should be good to go.

Ah, ok, downloading the full list of transactions isn't just for miners it's for verifying the ledger. So it's useful even if you just want to make sure you're buying the cryptocurrency you're trying to buy/you're using the chain you're meaning to. Good points.
Also, I had no idea segwit was necessary for lightning. The way I've heard about it it sounded like it was already possible on the blockchain. Besides splitting transactions into two parts, what else did it do?

If he says it's worth $4 million his parents will think he's joking/messing with them/gone crazy and throw it out. "Holy Shit!", "Kinda valuable." and "Please keep it safe." is enough to get across that he wants it/it's worth something, and is fine for now. He can explain that they have legit won the lottery after he gets the coins off.

About the same price it is now. That car's not special that people would wait in line for it, they'd just buy a different used car amongst any that meets their basic need for transportation.

Not ready to buy, but decided to click around on that site. Question:
How come when I'm on the  page and I click the "I'm not a robot" reCAPTCHA, NoScript tells me it's a "Potential Clickjacking / UI Redressing Attempt!" ?

Here's a site describing the method:

Which one's that/what's that do?
Second, what if someone likes segwit, but due to how it's being implemented doesn't want 2X? What do you think the split in hashing power between the two is going to be? Do you think the power left in segwit will be sufficient that I could stick with that coin?

Hm. Let's see. Blocks are 1MB. Blocks are made on average of once every ten minutes. According to [this]( each transaction is, on average 1/2 a kilobyte. So that's 2,000 transactions every 10 minutes. AKA 12,000 transactions an hour, 288,000 transactions a day, or 8,640,000 transactions/month.
Let's say a human population of 8,640,000,000 (we'll get there soon enough). If we averaged every person on Earth using bitcoin once per month, we would need 1,000 times the transaction capacity we currently have to keep up. It would also take over 4.3 terabytes of hard disk space to store all of those transactions, every month.
That's a lot. I can see why people would be reluctant to bring Bitcoin up to the capacity that's needed so that it really can be a universal currency.

Part of the appeal of Bitcoins is that you don't have to trust the bank, so there's that.

Ok, so the secret information ends up in RAM, but how would one do the encrypting/seed generation/whatever else *without* putting any of that information in RAM?

It is annoying when there's a low signal-noise ratio because people don't understand the technical details, like what a [signal-to-noise ratio]( is.

Wait... does this mean that if I get a house loan from a bank, and the bank goes under, I don't have to pay the loan back and essentially get my house for free?
If so, I may need to shop around for a bank that's close to insolvency...
