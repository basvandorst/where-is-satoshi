No, this is a bad idea. The algorithm change can only make a new altcoin.

OK, maybe you are right, in theory. But the reality is complicated. 
Compromise, or war. I don't think war is a good way to solve problem. It will destroy Bitcoin's future. 2M is better than uncontrollable block size. And the SW will have time to prove itself.

Yes. It is.

No. The buyers are real. You can sell your btc with the buy1 price and receive cny.

Well, I mean the orders are real. They may be posted manually or through market APIs. But they are real, so the prices are real. I don’t care the volume.

Because the Core devs don't like that.

Most of them also want block scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:47:38
That's what Im afraid of. The cores would rather do a UAHF than making a simple compromise.

The point is how can we persuade Core devs to add 2MB HF codes into the source. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:40:08
2M HF code is the precondition of signing SW, which is very clear in the HK agreement.

Miners are not enemies. They only want bitcoin success and make more money. That shouldn't be blamed. We need compromise, not war.
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:32:07
We are on that point now. HF or die. We can move forward with a simple compromise. I believe more than 95% users and miners will support it. It's better and safer than UASF.

So the Economic Majority isn't working? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:33:04
BIP148 is malicious because it will split the chain rudely, without the supporting of economic majority.
