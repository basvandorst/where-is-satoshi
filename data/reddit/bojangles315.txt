Tell her to go to her email, and search for btc. She can see where she sent the money. Chances are she sent all the coins to the darkweb. Likely evolution or alpha or silk road. All gone. So her coins are all going

10 cents, that looks like a good price to me

Nice, it's at 11. I'm never kicked myself for buying. Everytime I sell I kick myself
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:55:14
Well if fiat fails, I'll probably be trillions per btc

Gambling against decreased demand*. It's a set supply. More people will also come to market. New money will be introduced. Unlike the stock market, this is world wide. Sanctioned countries, criminals, the west, Europe, Russia, communist countries, everyone is evolved in the coin. This just brings it to the stage I feel. It may even stabilize the price and allow it to be easier to use as a currency 
When that happens, hopefully more businesses will jump on board. If we can get a stable gains and get out of the wild swings it'll be great.
Unless of course it all crashes and burns. Either is possibly. I have 500usd in my exchange account to daytrade swings though.
Also 2.5 hodling in my offline wallet. Only the future will tell!
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:04:43
Everyone is so fixated at the usd price. This is a world wide currency. It just passed 9000 pounds and 10k euro

I just bought drugs with it in 2013-15 then turned into the holder. I realized that if it worked so well in the black market, it's perfect for anyother internet purchase. I lucked out

The futures market is good. For instance, corn is the same price next year as this year. Farmers can hedge risk with purchasing new equipment in case the price tanks. So for miners it's good. That in turn leads to more miners in our world. More miners equals faster transactions. That toppled by more infrastructure like a lightening network. It'll hopefully bring it to the masses. But I'm biased, I'm a hodler 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:36:36
I started out not that much. In 26, I have ~10k in a 401k. I have a months salary in cash.... and 2.5 coins. It just grew so quickly, I never really noticed putting much in. But part of my net worth? A much higher percentage than I feel comfortable admitting 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:35:54
The drop has already happened. Everyone freaking out has already happened. It needed a correction but it's over. The market never does what you want it to
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:10:51
O shit. Is anyone else gonna try to trade some coin futures?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:31:29
Well it keeps growing, faster than my other net worth. But how many usd have I put in? Less than 5% of my current net worth. How much does it comprise? Half, maybe more of my current net worth
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:05:00
At that point I'm going to average down and catch the falling knife. I've never kicked myself in the long run buying, only selling 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:08:42
I sold and attempted to buy the swing, put my bid to low at 14001
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:37:57
A massive buildup before the bearish speculation. It's self fulfilling. In the long run, I believe in it though. So if it goes to 1000 or 10, I don't care. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:35:48
Look at the market cap. When the market caps are the same, then we are talking 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:27:08
I have 20k to put down on miners when the time is right
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:58:23
Btc does this all the time, you buy dips, granted, I sold at 16. That couldn't hold

I feel like bitcoin got its fame from the underground. Most people still have only heard of it through the rumors of things like silk road and computer viruses. This is why I propose that there be a donation to Dance Safe. They are a 501C that helps protect people from dangerous substances at raves and festivals all around the world. If there is a donation to Dance Safe, I don't have much, but I will contribute 25 usd worth of btc
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:26:42
Td Ameritrade has great lessons on it. So does etrade. Ameritrade will be selling bitcoin futures though, whereas etrade won't. If you decide to do something with it and play with it, let me know and I'll send you a referral to Ameritrade if you'd like. Win-win. Up to you. But god knows what the price will do. I'm gonna try some multi-legged plays with it. I was thinking about buying and selling a contract on the same expiration at the same strike.  Hopefully make some money on the delta. You can research plays with it, you don't have to sell single contracts. You can do it to make money going up, make money going down, make money staying the same price (theta decay) you name it. @_date: 2017-12-20 05:45:15

You're a troll right..... that's the entire fixation about this thing. A world wide currency no one controls. No manipulation (in the future) It's in the Bible for end times (jokes, but still kind of cool)

Td Ameritrade does!

You can't pick highs you can't pick lows. Average up and average down

Gemini is great. I use them. Low fees and they give you the money instantly 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:19:28
It recovered
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:34:06
I'd short when there is a good price to hedge my risk of buying a fuck ton of mines. That's about it
Edit: that price isn't coming anytime soon
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:17:33
It's gone! Forever!
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:41:00
I bought in back in 2013. At one point had like 10 coins. Probably had over 1000 coins total in my possession at one point or another. Ups and downs, bought things with it, traded it, sold it. I remember the original silk road with it. I found an old wallet with half a coin which I still have. This is when that was worth like 700 bucks. Also have about 2 coins in my pocket. So yes, cocaine and hookers. If I knew, I'd retire.... but I didn't. It's been a fun ride
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:39:10
It's going on the open market in the us. Shits about to get crazy. Wayyyy over exaggerated swings, day traders paradise 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:51:01
I've been buying more and more all year. My most recent, "12 hours ago	Completed limit buy order for 0.00846023 BTC @ $11,820.00"

I want to find a team of people to hthe lo setup the initial outlay of the company. I can handle the SEO. I need a Bitcoin wallet generator, security. Ect. Also help with the initial setup, I don't know 100% of everything with it. Coin base regulates to much, I want to compete and offer people the ability to buy Bitcoin and sell Bitcoin without so much oversight 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:28:19
No, you can buy things with it. Overstock.com and many other places. Just spend it as you would normal money. You can place your usd dollars in it until you would like to spend it on bitcoin goods. Check restaurants in your area and support the ones that take it
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:08:48
Futures are just going to reduce the risk of mining. I'm looking to short, but not because I don't trust the coin, rather to hedge me investment and guarantee a return on my coins. More people will follow suit. That combined with the lightening network, its fixing to really take off
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:15:00
to be fair, is was about a 50% dip
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:12:20
I'll simply state it. I'm newly out of college. I work in finance. I have my series 63 license and various insurance licenses. I'm working on my series 7. I have an understanding of Bitcoin, that's all, I don't work with it everyday. I see it being very big in the future though and want to be involved somehow. It's just an idea guys, I feel like I'm getting a lot of heat from this. I would simply like to be involved in some sort of Bitcoin startup
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:06:04
You violated their terms and conditions. I did it to 3 years ago 
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:16:55
I charge customers 40 usd to initiate an international wire which takes 12-24 business hours. ACH even longer but not internationally. I paid someone in Ukraine 50 dollars in Bitcoin; took 10 minutes and cost penny's. I want to be involved in this 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:13:57
I've already messaged my broker, td, to see when they will become available

Did you not watch dbz? Well I'll enlighten you. ITS OVER 9000!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:06:05
That's dumb. Bitcoin is great for international business, and an additional currency that may or may not hold value. Other than that, the dollar isn't going anywhere
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:04:14
If you had 4 btc 4 hrs ago, your be up like 1600 dollars

@_date: 2017-11-27 07:10:11
It's not a war between bitcoin and banks. Banks will adopt bitcoin. I can see private wallets becoming illegal, and names being addressed to wallets. Of course in the distant future. 
For this project to keep up we should want banks to adopt it. It'll allow the average joe and Jane to take part. Image, being able to convert between your own currency, to the digital currency, and spend money on the web. 
It takes things like swift down. Not banks. Plus I could never image taking a 1 btc loan out to buy a house in 2 years and have to repay it 20 years later.

I played around back in college. I always bought then spent it. All the way up to the 1000 dollar crash. Then three years ago started playing with it again, bought like 20 btc worth of shit with it around 200 a piece. Lost interest, now I'm back, at 7000. Holding forever now. Or at least until it hits the main stream. I make poor life decisions. I've probably spent over 100 coins in my life. Never much of a trader with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:01:56
