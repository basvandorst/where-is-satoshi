Well yeah, I actually had this thought too earlier.  I was trying to think of things that the first generation of something is the most valuable.  
Bitcoin.

Can’t prove any coin being the most decentralized, right?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:08:33
EmpiriCoin?  Where do I buy?
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:47:59
I’m glad America lets you feel that way.
The US gov has basically godly powers though, at least the closest thing to it humans have ever seen.

I never tried calling coinbase directly but most automated stuff you can press 0 a bunch of times and get a human.

constant posts of people with crypto stolen.  Both can be secured ‘better’ but none are bulletproof.

I don’t think you even understood m8.  Never got paid out.  Not in any wallet.  Over a week now.  No payout.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:21:54
hey, I’m here if you want to talk.. no judgement
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:52:39
As soon as I hit the payout amount, my money disappeared.  never got a payout.  Made a post on here and got shit for it.  WELL NOW WHAT NICEHASH
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:08:05
make sure to double check that address!  As always!
not that I distrust you, just to remind everyone!  Always double check!

Mad funny but I think “Buy Bitcoin.  Be Your Own Bank and Grow Your Wealth.”  Or something along those lines.  Very quickly

@_date: 2017-12-01 22:45:12
100% accepted shares.  Change my address?  Like my wallet address?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:14:34
You know... the r/btc (which should be r/bch) community is just 99% posts complaining about how BCH isn’t BTC.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:02:26
Pretty sure destiny 2 uses a crypto currency like thing

When crypto is more universally accepted (and we’re living in that rapidly changing moment right now!) people will think it’s too late to get a firm position in BTC and LTC* is “cheaper”. “Why not get some LTC just in case?” And I know these two coins will coexist for a very long time.
 
who knows though? ..not me.  Listening to others ideas for this stuff is always good, but never take anyone’s word in it.  Your decisions are yours, so make them yourself.  Look at graphs, who’s buying and selling (altcoin pumps), etc. Other people and news will just scare you or entice you to jump into or off something when you shouldn’t.   Above numbers have seemed to be a firm(ish) ratio.  At $8000  was 60-80$ per LTC, now at 10,000 it’s 80-100.  COINcidence?  :)  I DONT KNOW!  MAYBE IM SEEIN THINGS
Sure there was that one big spike at around 5000$ USD/BTC but it corrected itself, keep that in mind too.  
I would prefer to use LTC over BTC for a transaction.  Simply put,  Bitcoin is GOLD and you don’t spend your gold unless you’re spending a LOT.
*if some new people read my opinions and thoughts.  BTC and LTC are acronyms for Bitcoin and Litecoin, respectively, just like USD is for the United States Dollar. *
WE JUST HIT 10,000 on COINBASE BABY!

So i knew it was legit

more and more i read... the more and more i feel like the only chump who thinks this is the real future of our species.. a future of no borders and free enterprise.  Sure, i will make some profit and naturally i  hope i do but i hope significantly more we revolutionize the way “money” works and we, as people tear down the imaginary walls we have.  It’s bigger than being a millionaire to me.  It should be bigger than that for everyone involved and to be involved in the future.  Is bitcoin the answer?  Maybe, maybe not.  I’m rambling and i apologize and I’m not directing this at the person I replied to or anyone in our booming community.

When I bought in at 4300 for the “REAL” first time, I really thought I got in too late and wish I did sooner.  We all wish we did sooner, but I’ve pretty much doubled my savings.  :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:40:30
what if we do it sarcastically? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:24:50
I appreciate you pointing this out

LTC super undervalued
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:56:14
Damn dawg you’re so into Bitcoin even your account names look encrypted
@_date: 2018-07-22 06:13:14
I sent .07 BTC and it cost me 28 cents, took 5-10mins
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:41:10
It constantly runs, non stop.  Could you explain to me like I’m 5?
Oh I see, to send money, etc.. that makes sense
@_date: 2018-07-16 06:15:59
lol i do agree with others in saying we “don’t know what’s going to happen” 
but we all do... right...?  that’s why we’re all still holding/accumulating/etc?
I was entertained with your story, man.
