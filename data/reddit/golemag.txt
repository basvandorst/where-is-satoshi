So , Jack was giving an answer to this guy (who asked the question in Chinese) on the right (something that we don't see in the video i guess) and apparently got interrupted by Wright? I don't understand. Jack later says "Hold on, let me first finish the first question", then switches to Chinese so that everyone in the room can understand him. ... Wright getting annoyed that he can't understand a single word.. and starts speaking on top of Jack saying something irrelevant to what Jack was speaking about. So Jack got angry and told him to "Shut UP"
And Faketoshi stands up from his chair and double shoots "So,... No, you Shut uP".. Jacks stands as well (And 3 of Faketoshi's bodyguards swarm around him, one staying in front of him) and says "Ok so we can't talk?" .. And Shatoshi asks him - " You want to do this without English?" . Jack answers: "Why you say that? ... This is Taiwan .. everyone speaks Chinese".
Shatoshi: "I got invited here.."
Jack: "Me too"
Shatoshi: "I don't really care.."
Jack: "So be polite.. sit down .."
Shatoshi: "...."
Jack: "I never interrupted you... why are you talking you did not interrupt me.. "
Shatoshi: "You did actually"
Jack: "me? Tonight? Ok..."
Shatoshi: "You did.... " -- looking at the audience : "Am.. Excuse me..Am.. who wants me or him at this 
conference?.. Me and my technology ever in this Country.. or not?"
Jack: "This is like very [what is this word "sounds like -portrait-ed" ] .. it's a shame for like the whole crypto  currency " ...ecosystem"
.. Rest is obvious.
