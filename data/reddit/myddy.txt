Set up a credit/debit card if you want instant buys on Coinbase

I thought Coinbase was shady, then I started using Bittrex. I feel safer and more at peace paying 20% premiums at a bitcoin ATM then continuing trusting these exchanges run by fucking clowns.

Thank you for the reply. I can't find anything on their site on how it works. I'd like to solve my problem but I'm a little cautious using a tool that doesn't have a clear explanation on how it works. What's the incentive for them to help people for free? How does Viabtc profit from this?

OK I understand now. I was just missing the fact that it's a mining pool. Seems simple now. One more question- at the beginning of the next hour, does it proceed to the next batch of addresses (like a queue), or is it more like punching in your tx ID every hour and hoping you're one of the hundred?
Thank you for your help, I really appreciate it.

[The price of solar dropped below coal in India earlier this year.]( The Chinese don't give a damn about the environment, they'll only adopt green power when it costs less sum total than coal or nuclear. Unlike us Yankees where we have Valley entrepreneurs powering their entire mining warehouse operations with solar from the get go. China will surely hop on the train as soon as the financial incentive is there. 
The price of photovoltaic cells dropped more than 30% globally as well
At this precise time, yeah coal may be more economically viable, but it won't be very long before the setup cost of renewable energy drops below the old ways. There simply won't be an incentive to use coal when solar or wind will be cheaper in every aspect. Frankly I'll be surprised if less than 100% of crypto mining is powered by renewable energy by the end of this decade. 
I totally understand the concerns, but I don't buy into the hype. There are thousands of things more damaging to the planet than our temporary increase in things like coal

Apple has consistently shit the bed for literally years in terms of allowing illegitimate or otherwise malicious wallets onto the App Store. You can call me paranoid, but this consistent and repeated scenario of fake wallets flooding the store isn't meshing with the fact their vetting process has always otherwise been thorough and strict.
Does Apple have a vested interest in interfering with crypto? Are they developing their own blockchain or wallet perhaps? I feel a healthy dose of cynicism may not be uncalled for here

it sounds like you don't understand how Bitcoin works, if you think choosing a smaller fee is "distributing the cost among all Bitcoin users"

I thought ApplePay was handled in the same way as CCs, like a regular Visa, through the ACH? Is there any articles/info you can link me to please? I'd like to know more.

I'd like to see the numbers on how much of that power is generated by wind and solar. Without those stats, this article is basically FUD from an environmentalist angle. Don't support crypto! It's literally destroying the planet!! I don't give a damn how much power mining is consuming. Mining crypto will never result in an oil spill, destruction of coral reef, creation of nuclear waste, etc etc, all the *real* dangers threatening this planet right now.
Excessive power consumption is the least of our worries, solar and wind is getting cheaper literally by the week.

I choose the smaller fee for a tx I sent 4 days ago, still waiting....
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:02:56
You ain't joking! Submitted my tx ID at x:xx:32 my local time, immediately get error message "Submissions are beyond limit. Please try later." I'll just take this as a sign that the current block size is perhaps a little too small, if 100 people are poised at their keyboard waiting to accelerate their txs!
