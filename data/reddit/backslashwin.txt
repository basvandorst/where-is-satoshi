@_date: 2018-08-03 17:03:44
Not sure if you read the Fortune article on it but it seems pretty simple.  They think they can make tons of money on trading and storage fees if they can on-ramp the large institutional players by creating a "regulated" secondary centralized layer on top of Bitcoin.  
Trying to extrapolate this in my head, it looks like it will directly compete with the Lightning network.  I foresee that both will become larger with increased adoption/market cap but unsure who the masses will use more once this plays out.
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:03:14
Some good content in there but mostly a fluff piece on the NYSE/ICE dude.
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:12:36
I think you pretty much got it right here.  It’s the reason why people believe the price of gold is manipulated so it’s harder to tell what the real value of fiat currency is.  Hard currency beats easy ones as long as you can tell one from the other in the market.
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:38:56

This is exactly what I don't get.  Why try and throw in a rushed hardfork?  Do big blockers feel like Core never wants move the block size up?  Are they just tired of waiting?  I know for a fact that Eric Lombrozo (Core) wants 2x+ eventually.  Lets all cool our jets, see how segwit+LN works and then up the block size.  Slow and steady wins this race folks.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:25:10
....You win!....
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:40:21
Welcome!  Now get it off the exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:10:22
Which is where we will go once we come upon the next theoretical scaling limit of these implementations.  Core acknowledges this.  I think people are getting riled up about the order in which to do these upgrades and lose sight of the bigger picture:  When Bitcoin grows, we all win.
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:42:35
Exactly, I don't get it.  What is it that 2x will achieve that isn't already being done with Bcash?  Maybe its a mining takeover.  Crash the prices of Bitcoin AND 2x with a split, making Bcash look more stable/profitable.  Once that happens, all hashpower will move over to Bcash to claim the "Bitcoin" name/legitimacy and still have the power for ASICBoost.  Glad I'm protected with my tinhodl hat.

I had to convince my wife as well.  I pestered her for months and gave her a powerpoint slide presentation and everything.  In the end, we met halfway between what I wanted to buy and where she was comfortable.  
Bitcoin right now is super technical and there isn't an easy way to trying to explain the benefits and differences to new folks.  I try and recommend Andreas Antonopoulos' videos for beginners as he explains terms in very obvious but enlightening metaphors.  In the end though, some people just aren't interested.  
In my eyes, I think of Bitcoin as a hedge invenstment vs fiat inflation/collapse and a way to actually get some interest on your investment.  You seem to have your shit together as far as not investing in more than you can afford to lose.  Good luck and don't miss out on the hype-train!
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:41:49
Great read, thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:17:22
Antonopoulos talked about code ossification, like how we can't get rid of IPv4 because its caked into everything, as an example of what's happening.  Either way, for good or for bad, it'll continue to be harder and harder to make changes to the base layer, especially with a hardfork, without being highly contentious.  I'm optimistic that its a feature, not a bug.
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:01:23
I just did the same thing for my family.  Good luck!
I would also recommend checking out Andreas Antonopolous on youtube (aantonop) especially his Bitcoin for Beginners stuff.  The best way to explain most of the advantages and features is to use analogies and he has a bunch.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:50:35
I advise all newcomers to check out some of the videos from Andreas Antonopoulos on youtube (aantonop) to learn more about money, bitcoin, and its implications.
Example: 
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:26:04
Well, theoretically, we will implement an escrow type system (multisig accounts) where the merchant won't get paid until you receive whatever you ordered.  Once the transaction is signed by the escrow holder (maybe via delivery company), the funds will be transferred.  If you never get your item, you go to the escrow party to cancel the transaction.  Consumer protections!

Well most of it is warranted, I believe.  If you don't trust this sub (nobody should, they should do their own research) go check out Andreas Antonopoulos on youtube (aantonop) and listen to his takes on why Bitcoin is better than gold/fiat.  Sample: 
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:28:14

Check out Andreas A. on youtube (aantonop), especially his intro to bitcoin stuff.  Great speaker and great info.

You have to start somewhere!  Don't try and time this market for dips, just get your feet wet and only invest what you can afford to lose right now.  Put that coin in a wallet you like and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:56:00
Very interesting and I'm surprised this isn't getting more attention.  If the lightning network gets really rolling then it could possibly out compete every other form of money.

@_date: 2017-11-05 16:39:21
As long as you can sign the transaction securely you can broadcast it anyway you want insecurely.  Doesn’t have to be qr, but you have to get their public address somehow for the transaction.  I recall Andreas talking about using chirp in stores which would be a neat thing to try.  Once lightning is up I think we’ll see all kinds of cool innovations on the pos front.

Yes, anything you can afford to lose but enough you expect to save/grow.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:21:08
First do a bunch of research to make sure you have a grasp of what you’re getting into.  I’ve never moved that much money but maybe a wire to gdax.  Will need other opinions on this.  Next, transfer it to a few hardware wallets (ledger nano s or trezor).  Store those hardware devices and the seeds in super safe places and then set up your will or estate planning to disseminate those to the appropriate parties.  Very high overview, every step will be pretty detailed so take your time with each.  Good luck!

Hey Method,
Long term storage for coins, go with a paper wallet until you get a hardware wallet (Trezor/Ledger Nano).  Pretty easy to set up a paper wallet.  For hot wallets, choose one you like that has custom fees.  Segwit addresses are a plus.
Not sure where the best place to buy is, I've used coinbase but not sure about UK.
I like this subreddit obv for news but also coindesk, steemit, and youtube.  
I suggest to every new Bitcoiner to watch some Andreas Antonopoulos videos on youtube (aantonop) to get the basics down and Tone Vays is a good place to start if you're more interested in price movements.  He does stuff on the World Crypto Network.
Good luck!  Hope that was helpful.

Hmm, if Bitcoin is such an inefficient system, and a centralized "Bittoken" (read FIAT) is far better, why does Bitcoin even exist as it is today when the FIAT system also already exists?  Might be people are starting to wake up to the fact that our monetary system could use a few upgrades.

@_date: 2017-07-30 15:33:30
Well, as of right now, you're right.  I can't wait to see what the LN does to transaction fees for small amounts.  We will always, due to the nature of a decentralized system, be less efficient in speed vs a centralized one.  The trade-offs though (security, immutability, borderless, etc.) are definitely worth it though.
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:26:27
No reason in particular.  I'm never right on anything so move along. Buuuuut if I'm right, I'll be able to buy on the cheeeap.
