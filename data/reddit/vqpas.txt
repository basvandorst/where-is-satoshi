Argentinian here. 
1 - Argentina defaulted in 2001, offered new debt titles afterwards and 92% of the debt was restructured this way.
2 - The remaining 8% (called holdouts) sued Argentina and after a long process they finally won last month (1.5 billion USD debt)
3 - Argentina made a programmed interest payment on other debt and judge freezes the money as collateral for the 1.5b debt.
4 - Now many more debtors are not getting their money either until holdouts receive their payment. 
5 - 1.5 billion is peanuts for Argentina . The problem is that most of the restructured debts have a "Rights upon future offers" clause that would trigger 100b USD obligations if Argentina pays the sentence before Dec 31, 2014.
6 - This will be solved probably by private banks buying the holdouts debt for a premium, and then reimbursed somehow by Argentina in 2015. Again 1.5b is not real money for Argentina.

I guess most alts do not have a stable and liquid alt/usd market so they are bought with bitcoin in cryptsy or other multi-exchange.  I speculate that Bitcoin, due to its liquidity and availability of exchanges is the fiat "gateway" for the crypto ecosystem. 
If the market for alts collapse, the alt/btc will go down, some alt holders will trade their alts for bitcoins and keep the bitcoins and some others will trade them and try to cash them out in fiat. All the fiat that is leaked in this movement will affect the btc/usd price.

That is the standard Keynesian argument. Very convenient for the statists and grant-receiving economists.

Yes, you are right. As long as they don't attack the network there is no way of telling who is controlling what.
I have this idea that in a few years, when the incentive for mining is based on fees, It is probable that some miners keep some hashpower (maybe old equipment or inefficient equipment) on hold and jump in if there is an attack on the network or a sudden reduction of difficulty or exchanges/companies buying mining power to speed up their transactions.

I think the miner market will become more competitive with time. Chips will become more and more efficient up to some point, no special know-how will be needed, and ultimately the fight will be for cheap energy.
Cost of mining now is largely based on capital expenditure, but in the future most of the cost will be energy. Shipping energy is more expensive than shipping bits (yes, those thick power cables take a toll...) so isolated places with [wind,solar,tidal,hydro] power in excess will be hosting the mining operations.
As the market is more leveled 51% attacks are less probable and operations will need all the transactions fees they can get so a block size increase will probably happen.

I'm tempted to think that controlling the economic cycle with money supply manipulation is too good to be true and I'm genuinely interested in checking my simplified understanding from an honest keynesian.
1 - Is the FED (or any central bank) supplying volumes of new money in order to keep prices slightly inflationary to counter that they would be deflationary due to productivity gains of the overall economy?
2 - Is the government ultimately getting all this new money, if so it seems fair, since they are the best representation of "we the people" ("best" does not mean "good enough")
3 - Most of that money goes to the roots of the economy in the form of social welfare, roads, etc.  That money is effectively spent (as opposed to saved) in goods and services, thus moving the gears of the economy (it takes time for that money to go to the top and get collected by big capital). This is a good action if you are in a recession, but is bad and leads to inflation if your economy is near full employment/full capacity.
4 - Big capital is conserved and augmented through time in the form of ownership of companies (stock), land or other scarce items and debt. 
5 - The "sensors" that the FED uses to estimate the amount of money to inject is employment rate and inflation. What is going on in the US that we are not getting inflation in spite of the massive amounts of money injected, where is all the money going?

The POW cost structure will quickly become dominated by energy cost.
As capital investment for bitcoin mining becomes less and less important compared with running costs , lots of new players (those with access to cheap energy) will be in position of offering hashpower, thus diluting the possibility of a 51% attack by pools collusion. 
Furthermore, if Jeremy Rifkin is right, average Joes will have disposable energy from their rooftops in the next 15 years.

Sorry for my confusing post. I'll try to explain what I meant.
The effect of merchants keeping some btc parked is just as important as the effect of customers keeping small amounts of btc parked for the next buy. I would argue that price will be supported by millions keeping 10-100 USD in btc not as investment but as convenience. 
I foresee services such as popcorntime charging satoshis per minute for movie streaming, or for wifi connection or for cloud storage. In order to use those services automatically (your client apps must manage a wallet with some btc on it) you have to fill it first and keep the balance in btc, even if it is 10 USD you are already slowing down bitcoin velocity (parking btc) and helping the price up.

Thanks! I'll give it a try (a bit above my level though) .
My question was aimed to imagine a DAC (distributed autonomous corporation) that performs tumbling of bitcoins in a hosted environment, paying the bill (and send the rest to charity) with the tumbler fees. The problem is that you need to trust the tumbler is not tainted. 
 As a working example SatoshiDice DAC can prove that the random numbers are not skewed by issuing the hash of a list of future numbers 
One way to achieve this is executing this code in a blockchain with POW but I find it too slow and  non-elegant
Yet another way would be like this:  "run miners" deposit a collateral of x BTC 
to participate in joint execution. All miners receive the input data and execute the algorithm. All results (tx trans) are compared (somehow), the winning results  (by miners votes or sum of collaterals) wins. Those who lost (most of the time: none) lose the collateral. The output is transmitted to the network.
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:39:02
A fake block (one with unacceptable transactions) is as costly as a valid one.
The time it takes for broadcasting and analyzing the transaction list is a small fraction of the 10 minutes period. 
The task for receiving and analyzing the transaction list can be done in paralell with SHA256 mining. i.e. you don't use the asics for that.
In any case, is up to the miners to wait and see or start mining on the (very probably) next block
I don't think DOS is a vector attack for this approach, but something in the lines of selfish mining can be. It needs to be analyzed carefully

Lately I've been thinking that if bitcoin succeeds the only way to effective taxation will be tax on property (land, house, car, boat, facilities).  Prices will adapt to this (for example to rent a house will be more expensive, but remember you don't pay any income or sales tax)
By eliminating the income tax and all the loopholes riches will end up paying more than now. Also a lot of people working on the IRS and millions of accountants will be employed in other more productive jobs.

I might overestimated the software portion of the exchange. In any case a whole army of programmers was exposed to the inner workings of an exchange and their APIs and I predict more exchanges will appear for other markets, new bots and bot development tools. That is only one of the path of innovations that bitcoin enabled. 
*better stock market*
The way we register property (land, stock, deeds ) is kind of obsolete, paper trails, signatures, witnesses, etc.  I know it sounds far fetched but using a blockchain for this is an innovation. Complex transactions of currency vs property can be written in the blockchain and that will eliminate the need of "interpretation" and third parties. Also, the fact that the blockchain is not owned by a government sets the stage for supranational institutions. I know is far fetched, but do you honestly think the nation-state concept is the final step on the evolution on the political systems?

4 - The  "forged" transaction is valid and included in a block the original stays unconfirmed (double spend)
5 - The user "complains" to MtGox saying that the original txid was not included in any block.
6 - Gox "stupidly" issues a newr witdrawal transaction.

I honestly don't follow your reasoning. Case A : Alice the bitcoin holder does no want to divest she either holds (A1) or buys something in overstock and replenish her bitcoins right after the buy (A2).  Case B: If Alice wants to divest she either sells in an exchange (B1) or buy something in overstock (B2).
In case A, the effect of Alice in the market is almost null (A2 is better for Bitcoin the payment network and overstock)
In the case B, she is pushing the USD/BTC market downward, although B2 is good for the Bitcoin the payment network and overstock.
My hypotesis is that the decision to buy in overstock does not affect the price of the bitcoin, but affects in good manner the value of Bitcoin the payment network.

I know nothing, but larger pools have less variance on their luck so they can pay the miners almost continuously. A small pool can only pay miners when they hit a block and it can take seconds or months.
Worse, when difficulty is on the rise and the miner has a fixed hashrate the odds of winning decrease so the variance is not only an apparent effect (compensated in the long term) but a real one. Source: my ass

good for the economy overall != good for everyone
The central planners can make their currency inflationary with a purpose and that is fine, they have their goals. 
Some people don't want to spend. If fiat is inflationary and rates are below inflation, the invisible hand will find assets to store wealth with low risk. If public assets are used (land, houses, stock), the prices will enter bubble status and also there is the risk that planners eventually start taxing them. There is a serious need of a liquid asset that is not public (holdings can not be taxed) and easy to transact (currency-like)

what about transmitting a "block solved" message with just the header and then another large message with the payload of transactions?
I understand that checking the validity of transactions does not need massive paralell SHA256 calculations, so the other miners can start mining the next block, while waiting for the payload and checking the transactions in parallel.
It does not benefit a malicious miner to broadcast a false header because the miner still needs to find a noonce for the false header and it takes the same shawork as a valid header full of transactions.

some other facts AFAIK
1 - a wallet is a collection of 1 or more public addresses
2 - each public address has a secret key
3 - coinbase "wallet" is more like a bank account, you don't have the secret key ergo the bitcoins are not really yours. You trust coinbase to take care of your bitcoins.
4 - blockchain wallet gives you the secret key of your public addresses. They don't keep a copy, so you better take measures not to lose it.
5 - software based wallets allow to interact with the network directly i.e. you have the keys (usually in an encrypted file)
6 - cold storage means you generate the public/private keys and print the private and keep it for you. Then send btc to the public address.

This pdf was my first exposure to practical multi-sig. I have a couple of doubts:
1 - Why the last signer can not broadcast the transaction and has to send it back to the originator?
2 - I (wrongly) envisioned that the transaction was broadcasted "half signed" and the client has a list of "pending approvals" coming straight from the network. I guess we will have to add another layer for that and avoid using the bitcoin network, right?

If you are talking to an individual, that is a very good selling point for bitcoin. 
If you are talking to a community, bitcoin is evil and somebody should ban it.
That said, bitcoin is very hard to ban without seriously violating the most basics human rights (communicate with others, use math, keep public records, keep secrets). 
The state can give it a try (ban bitcoin in its current format), but the cat is out of the bag now.

In a flat market bots take advantage of low liquidity situations. When a spot buy (or sell) order is put, it takes not only the most competitive bids but also some other orders as well, thus a large spot buy/sell is paying a premium and bots usually collect there.
They have also a beneficial effect as they smooth the natural movements of low liquidity markets, basically they offer hidden liquidity. source: my ass

Here some ideas that might be interesting:  
* 60% of the fund in liquid BTC in cold storage. 20% floating in exchanges providing liquidity to the overall market (with a known bot algorithm?). 20% stock and other risky businesses.
* Transparency: You demonstrate ownership of holdings at all times. Is trivial for Cold storage, for the money on the exchanges you can provide user/pass for readonly access.
* Balances of the fund nominated in BTC
* Costs of the fund to be fixed in Dollars but shared proportionally among stakeholders.
* Insurance: No regular insurance needed, but if you lose the cold coins you are sued to death, and you seem to be a guy with much to lose.
* The funds are legally transferred to relatives if the stockholder dies.

If states don't actively ban bitcoin then is only up to individuals to choose bitcoin or fiat for daily use and for wealth storage.
Individuals are selfish (I know I am) and do not care much about the fate of a ghostly entity called "economy" . They will act selfishly on their best interest pick the best currency and in that regard that currency is the most secure and deflationary crypto possible.
Is up to the PhD in Economics to counter this "problem" (i.e. individual tend to act in self-interest) to solve the issues of the "economy". Banning bitcoin is not an option, attacking bitcoin will lead to another crypto, think something else.

First let's settle who is paying the CC fee. That's easy: Is always the consumer either with surcharges or because is embedded in the price and cash-consumers are subsidizing it.  
Now what you are paying with those fees : 
* consumer protection (CP) : if you don't receive what you expect, you can claim and get reimbursed.
* CC fraud protection (CCF): cards are stolen, numbers are leaked. The technology of the CC industry is 50 years behind and is a complete joke. 
* Credit Cards costs and profit (CCCP)
If you use bitcoin properly, you only need CP and only when making a purchase of a complex item from some shady place. You don't pay for CCF, regarding CCCP bitcoin transaction fees and exchange conversions are competitive markets while credit cards are more like a cartel.

purchasing for fiat is only one way of getting cryptocurrencies. You can sell goods or services, you can even mine. Purchasing with fiat has also many options: exchanges, friends , localbitcoins.
Once you are in cryptospace transactions can be done without trusting a third party. You can buy other cryptocurrencies, gamble, trade cryptostock.

A - if bitcoin replaces fiat and all goods and services are denominated in btc, the salaries will HAVE to be lower year after year, and that is very difficult to negotiate or accept with our current upbringing. Sure, it can be rationalized but it will take time and a lot of social revolts and strikes and other social movements.  In addition to that, each state has the obligation of governing the economic climate to reach high employment/low inflation. They do it by manipulating the monetary base, bitcoin overtaking fiat takes away that tool and that might be worse for the lower income people.
B - I don't think people will not buy bitcoin because it is deflationary. It does not make sense. All investments are "deflationary" by definition. People is selfish and they will buy and convert fiat to bitcoin as investment. If that collective behavior is bad for the economy and trigger recessions and whatnots, then is up to the governments to solve that (I can only hope they are creative enough not to ban bitcoin) and not to the individuals.

Double spends.  If you have 51% you can successfully fork the blockchain and leave one or more orphan blocks. On those blocks the evil miner could have spent many bitcoins (and they got confirmed in those blocks), received the goods, money, whatever and then proceed to orphan those blocks and re-spend the same outputs.

Then I would go with my 
1 - Is the FED (or any central bank) supplying volumes of new money in order to keep prices slightly inflationary to counter that they would be deflationary due to productivity gains of the overall economy?
Productivity is increasing due to automation, technology and economies of scale. Businesses need less humans and less resources to make things and provide services. Leave unchecked this will pressure prices down. The effect is so intense in some industries like consumer electronics that you actually see prices go down. 
If most industries have productivity gains, they would induce a deflation.
A deflationary economy has problems because salaries can not be adjusted down and expectations are curbed due to most people failing to realize declining earnings are just fine. 
Whenever the inflation rate is low, the FED injects money to keep prices above the 0% line.  
Please explain if my line of reasoning is logical.
Edit: as per "why bitcoin would be the solution" . Bitcoin is not a solution (to what problem?), just a new extremely independent scarcity asset.

It is what it is. I do not want to criticize the status-quo but to get an idea of the vast amount of money and power we are dealing with if we somehow convince the people to use bitcoin as a reserve currency or store of wealth.  
I also see that Reserve Banks are also doing a valuable work to stabilize the economic cycle (vg using QEs and interest rates) and bitcoin does not offer any of that. On the other hand, for the sake of "price stability and the benefits of some inflation" wage workers are transferring the massive savings of the productivity gains to someone else. I mean we are improving quality and producing more with less personnel year after year but you only see rising (albeit not much) prices? where is this productivity going? We should be seeing deflation all over and not only on LED TVs.  I hope the concept of bitcoin brings clarity to the masses regarding this.

here is a tl;dr summary 
1 - Argentina defaulted in 2001, offered new debt titles afterwards and 92% of the debt was restructured this way.
2 - The remaining 8% (called holdouts) sued Argentina and after a long process they finally won last month (1.5 billion USD debt)
3 - Argentina made a programmed interest payment on other debt and judge freezes the money as collateral for the 1.5b debt.
4 - Now many more debtors are not getting their money either until holdouts receive their payment.
5 - 1.5 billion is peanuts for Argentina . The problem is that most of the restructured debts have a "Rights upon future offers" clause that would trigger 100b USD obligations if Argentina pays the sentence before Dec 31, 2014.
6 - This will be solved probably by private banks buying the holdouts debt for a premium, and then reimbursed somehow by Argentina in 2015. Again 1.5b is not real money for Argentina.

I know nothing about quantum computers, but I would assume they can try all nonces of a blockheader at once and find the solution of a block in milliseconds, wiping the competition, driving difficulty to maximum and once there lowering the block time to 10 seconds. That would exhaust the bitcoin money supply well before 2140.

I meant the amount of money you spent using the CC during that month. IF something happens and you now find you can not pay the bills they automatically "finance" your debt. If you are lucky and finance savvy you probably end up not using their "financing" options, but most people will, usually the poor or lower middle class. That is what I meant with the 1 in x people bet. 
The more participants in this giant reverse-insurance schema, the more money they make and that is why they treat people with all those benefits you mentioned.

M-of-N Distributed Programmable contracts are cool but maybe too complex to implement, and too complex for regular people to enter.
I already see people placing bets on pre-written digital contracts in centralized trusted institutions: specialized Oracles like BitBet, Just-Dice or Bitfinex. 
If the real-life events that define the contracts are centralized there is not much gain in decentralizing the processing algorithm.

Didn't read the article, but my line or reasoning for investing in bitcoin involves the possibility of taking over a 10% of the remittance market + gambling + porn + illegal stuff. The market is huge. Conversions from fiat to bitcoins just to support the necessary liquidity of that market (20%?) would make the ratio btc/usd fly.

Some facts I think I know:
1 - A wallet is a collection of bitcoin addreses
2 - Each bitcoin address has a private key
3 - The only way to move funds from an address is signing a transaction with the private key.
4 - When you generate an address you also get the private key
5 - If you want to keep a paper wallet, you need to print your private key in it
6 - If you want to protect it further, you print an encrypted version of the private key.
7 - BIP0038 is based on scrypt an encryption schema that is *Very* slow so it kind of defeats brute force for now (until theoretical scrypt asic farms exist)

I think we are close to peak-centralization. After peak we will see a decrease in that.
Mining profit was a function of (know how,  bitcoin risk tolerance, electricity cost)
The know how is quickly becoming less important. Efficiency gains due to new chips are already diminishing
Bitcoin risk tolerance is also increasing for all actors including the ones not currently present.
So when these factors are out, the only important factor will be electricity cost.

1 - The amount of hashpower required to secure the chain is not proportional to the value of all bitcoin flows or the total value of bitcoin market cap, it will be eventually proportional to the fees paid. So the hashpower self regulates with the willing of people to pay fees. If people is wasting energy going to Rome to see the Coliseum why don't you allow them to waste energy in securing payments. It is their choice. 
2 - Miner chips will be ubiquitous in a few years, SHA256 circuitry is simple and well understood and there are no software improvements in sight (except for asicboost). That means that the  "capital expenditure" side of the miner equation will tend to 0, while the "operative costs (Energy)" will dominate.  Once that happens, cheap energy sources will beat the current Bitmains and Bitfurys
3 - Oil or gas (CO2 emissions) is not cheap energy at all, and will never be. It is convenient (till now) for cars, trucks, planes. But mining does not need "portability"  so Hydro, Nuclear and other will be chosen.  There are other factors such as: if the energy source is removed from the grid, it will be more convenient to mine bitcoins there, if there is a need of heat (like houses in winter) mining can be even more economical than AC or Gas Furnaces.
4 - Another possible scenario is that there can be an arms-race where miners compete with very efficient energy sources, but if there is a need for "vote" they can fire up their less efficient equipment. So the amount of total (potential) hashpower can be orders of magnitude higher than the hashpower actually used. Kind of the nuclear weapons standoff between Russia vs USA during the cold war.

Reasons for CC discounts:
A - CC bet that some percentage of the cardholders will not be able to pay full amount and they will finally pay much more that 5% more (due to standard cc financing and even fall-behind fees)
B - retailers target CC holders (offering discounts) because CC holders typically burn more money in unnecessary items than cash-holders. This point is controversial but anyway CC holders typically have more disposable income.
So those discounts are aimed to attract financially-unaware people to the store.

I have a confusion between client default values and the bitcoin protocol. Please ELI5
1 - Are miners free to include transactions regardless of fee paid? i.e. can a miner include for instance 1Mb of free transactions?
2 - When a block is discovered, are miners checking the 1Mb hard limit size? (obviously yes, but prepares for the next question)
3 - When a block is discovered, are miners checking that a "priority transactions" sub-block is included, do they check the size, and if the transactions belong there? Is this part of the protocol, or just a default behavior?

An example might be:
+ A company has one or more btc addresses. 
+ a CEO has posession of the private keys, but they only last 1 year enforced by script.
+ When private keys are due, an election of a new CEO is celebrated.  stockholders vote for candidates in the blockchain (using signatures)
+ A new set of private keys is generated and delivered to the new CEO in order to conduct business
+ Dividends are paid from the company addresses, enforced by blockchain script.

Yes, I guess Satoshi would shoot himself if he has to rely on timestamps, although he put it on the header along with some basic validations in the protocol. 
There is some room for a pragmatic solution in case we don't find an elegant one. Latency is easily one order of magnitude lower than block generation. Who knows, some years from now the latency and connectivity of the network will make using timestamps a pragmatic solution for these kind of attacks.

You can denominate the loan in other terms, such as construction costs or meat.
In fact I have a borrower that owes me in meat, and he pays 5% year interest quaterly and we just add the corresponding pounds of meat to the capital. Of course when is time to cash out, we convert the pounds to currency using an prearranged price index.
