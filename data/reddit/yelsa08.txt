I was thinking that too. So won’t be surprised to see this happen at $9950, $9975 and $9990. But the good news is if we keep seeing rejections it means we keep climbing back up.

Have you heard of Bears? You know the people that are trying to drive the price down. They do exist you know.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:57:38
If this is the rejection we get at $9930 I can only imagine how many sell orders are in place at $10k. Rocky roads ahead ��

Well I like the Ledger Live app on my phone. Don’t know if Trezor do something similar or not

Every time this meme goes up, Bitcoin goes down. Yet people continue to post it. I guess upvotes are more important than money ��‍♂️

Same for me too. This happened a few weeks ago with my Ether and when I resynced it with my laptop it worked properly again
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:32:26
Did we not learn from a few weeks ago?

I didn’t say there was a big correction or anything like that, simply stated an undisputed fact and that is that Bitcoin was rejected at $9930. It dropped over $200 in SECONDS. Hours later we are still at $9800. We will still likely break $10k today or over the weekend but for now take your L and move on.

$10,999.98 ��
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:12:18
I can feel it coming today

I bought my first Bitcoin in April for €4450. 2 months later it’s more than double that. I have no intention of selling even if we get to 100k during this cycle. Surely any long time HODLer that has endured an almost 18 month bear market would not be stupid enough to sell as soon as things start looking rosy?
@_date: 2019-06-13 21:29:11
8350 is the major resistance, need to break that
@_date: 2019-06-14 02:17:58
Looks like my ass was right. Keep downvoting
@_date: 2019-06-18 06:56:20
$9500 is looking likely to be the high. The bulls are constantly being rejected at $9400 and they are only really stepping in around $9100
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:12:53
Eh I think dropping over $200 in a matter of seconds can be put in the rejection category pretty comfortably
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:58:02
Lol what?
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:27:53
If it stays around $8950-$9000 for the next few hours then I’ll get optimistic it can really push on towards 10k
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:21:03
Just some bear whale I’d imagine. Already back up to $9100
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:28:43
I’m a HODLer. I’m not planning on selling any time soon. The only point I was making is that the road to 10k and beyond isn’t going to be easy as it was looking earlier (still expecting to break it tonight though)
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:28:40
Do you have yours already?!
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:41:00
Is it just me or is the worst thing about Coinbase the layout of the new app update on iPhone?
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:45:12
Have a bad feeling we will get rejected. Come on bitcoin ��
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:59:25
Do you want my PIN number and bank details too?
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:48:23
I think it’s just a spike and we will go back down. But I hope to be wrong
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:44:04
RIP bears

I don’t know why you are being downvoted, this isn’t impossible, no withdrawals on Binance could be a factor aswell. I don’t agree with you though, there is too much momentum for this not to be a bull market.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:48:54
Didn’t last long ��
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:57:13
Happy days now keep going ��

Tbh looking at market volatility, as much as I hate to say it, I’d be surprised if there wasn’t a crash soon. That’s prob the time to buy
