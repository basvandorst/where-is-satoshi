What about using Abra?

It is now 50%.

Fair point - although it does not negate my larger point which is that the CBOE trading does not enable anyone to "short" BTC.

You can’t short the underlying asset on a futures market.  Futures markets trade put and call contracts.  Shorting involves borrowing actual shares and selling them in the primary market.  Two different things.

"May" is the operative word.  If it were me, I would swap enough back to BTC in 2017 to have paper losses equal to the paper gains.  That way, I would be covered either way - if 1031 works then it is all swaps and things are fine; if 1031 doesn't work then I have losses to offset the gains.  Once 2017 ends, you can't go back in time and do some trading if you find out the IRS rules in a way you don't like.

I believe this is how the IRS sees it.  But as Spoofy suggested, the OP should hire an accountant to help work out a plan.
Here is the IRS opinion  
The two key points:
Q-1: How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes?
A-1: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.
Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for other property?
A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency. See Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for information about the tax treatment of sales and exchanges, such as whether a loss is deductible.

No, it is not.  If I buy $1000 worth of gold at $1000 per ounce and then at a later date when it is worth $2000 per ounce I trade it for silver, I just realized a $1000 gain in the eyes of the IRS.

If you are a US citizen, you may want to look at the tax situation here.  Many of those trades out of BTC may have created short term gains (assuming BTC was over 2700), and thus a tax liability.  I suggest swapping some holdings back to BTC to generate some losses so you are at least neutral from a tax basis.  Or swap them all back and get a tax loss carry forward that will probably cover your gains for the next few years.

Stocks are also "property" and IRS publication 544 excludes them from like kind treatment.  I agree that it seems to be a grey area at the moment, but when it does get clarified, one should have a plan that deals with both possible interpretations.  Given the amount of money the OP claims to have at play, the outcomes can be significant and unpleasant.  The one thing worse than taking a six figure loss is taking a six figure loss and getting a bill from the IRS.

Put your public address into the search box on these sites and if you see a balance then you have coins on the BCH blockchain.  or

There is a good chance that the legal interpretation will be that you have a $20 gain in this example and owe taxes.  As to how you pay the IRS, they don't care what is in your wallet, they care about how many $ you need to send them.

I did not know this until I read this thread.  That is an interesting angle.  I took a quick look and you will pay 5% on the portion of the gain that occurred before your move - but still an attractive proposition.

The folks at Abra ( are targeting this market directly with a bitcoin based platform.
