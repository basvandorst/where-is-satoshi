I keep up to date but I don't stress about it. I bought in 2013 and then watched the price drop for two years so stressing over daily fluctuations seems silly to me.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:12:16
What matters is purchasing power and the purchasing power of bitcoin is governed by fiat because goods are priced in fiat.

Buy if you want some and it is part of an overall strategy. Don't think you are propping the price up or contributing to Bitcoin just by buying.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:18:15
Seems like he is just concerned that it will be too easy. Just because cash can also be used illicitly doesn't mean that they shouldn't look at Bitcoin as well.

There is always a balance between buyers and sellers. Billions of dollars of btc gets traded everyday. if the buyers want more than the sellers have to sell then it puts upward pressure on the price and vice versa. It could be the hype and people jumping in who previously didn't want to. It could be institutions coming in and adding btc to their portfolios. Its hard to know why because the people making the big moves aren't going to want people knowing what they are doing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:41:53
There was a lot of hype when it hit 1300 in 2013. I thought the same thing. I bought some at 900 but the price kept dropping. I always thought that it would be neat to have a whole bitcoin but i couldn't afford it. Eventually I just let it go but I kept an eye on it. After a couple years of slowly dropping the price was under 300. I realized i could finally buy a whole one but because it seemed like it wouldn't recover i didn't want one anymore. If the price dropped to 1000 tomorrow a lot of people think they would buy it but being in the situation is a lot different.
I think it is good for people to buy a small amount and then just ignore it. If it tanks then you don't lose much but in ten years it might be a lot higher. If you invest too much then it'll always be a worry in the back of your mind and you'll make bad decisions. 
One thing you can do is to buy a small amount now and then don't buy anymore unless it drops to a certain price like 5000. in your mind this takes some of the stress off. If it goes up you are good but if it drops then you get a better price and get more. Just make sure to stick to your plan. Or you can try dollar cost averaging where you buy a small amount once a month no matter what the price. 
The best thing to do is to act logically and not based on the current hype and hysteria. Make sure you are aware of the risks and the emotional costs. I like this [post](
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:01
Its inevitable that some people over invested and this place is definitely to blame for a lot the hysteria. Its easy to say to tough it out but this could end in devastation for a lot of people, especially those who leveraged.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:59:18
it was more of a spike, it shot up too fast grabbed everybodies attention and then dwindled. i think the market was too thin to handle the pressure and it also could have been a problem with mt Gox which I think was where the price was being set, I can't really remember. There were also more coins being mined back then which could explain the price dropping for two years.
edit: Mt Gox also collapsed and there was issues with butterfly labs. The infrustructure around bitcoin was horrible and needed a few years to mature. A lot of people jumped in but got hacked or scammed which killed a lot of the hype.

So the miner runs and when it gets bitcoin it will deposit it to a bitcoin address. [here](
You would want to look through his stuff for paper wallets. Would look like [this](
You would also want to check his computer for wallet.dat files. If he has the bitcoin program on his computer you can just start it.
Also look for passwords/usernames for any online accounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:41:27
If bitcoin's value depends on it not being spent then the current price is a mirage. For bitcoin to gain mass adoption, it needs to find usefulness in everyday life, and that usefulness will lead to to it being spent. I believe that for bitcoin to actually grow the price will drop because people want to spend them.

A lot of people think the price is flimsy enough that negative talk could derail their gains. Billions of dollars worth get moved everyday but they think telling a bunch of people to hodl their .1 btc is going to prop the price up. I honestly think the mentality of this place has done more damage to bitcoin than good. I honestly think that if this whole place went all in on trying to destroy the price of bitcoin that they would realize that they don't actually have much influence. Bitcoin doesn't need to be sold and pushed everyday with gimmicks and sleazy tactics like sneaking signs onto the news etc. But people like to feel like they are part of a movement.

When ever new people ask about jumping in i share [this](
When bitcoin first hit 1300 back when it first started hitting the news, so many people got wrecked. I bought in at 900 and 700 and then it went to 200 over a couple years. I remember a guy running an bitcoin shop and we would talk sometimes. As it dropped i could see a real desperation in his eyes and I knew he was severely over invested. The shop ended up closing and I don't know what happened to him. Anyways, don't pump. This hype is going to wreck a lot of people.
story  I checked a lottery ticket for a guy once at a gas station and he won 160k. He was running around like it was the best day of his life. I told him he was one number away from 40 mil. Anyways, he came back a year later, had gained 50 lbs and was broke and miserable. He told me he'll never forget what I told him about the one number so i guess I should have kept my mouth shut. Money and hope does weird things to people.

Do what's best for yourself, Money Bags McGee here can buy whatever he wants. Bitcoin could be at 5000 or 1000 in a week so don't invest more than you can loose. The nice thing about CDAing is it removes the emotions from trading. If you over invest then your emotions will be out of control. Small amounts are better. 
I invested a couple hundred a year ago and fully expected it to tank so the emotional cost of watching go up and down wasn't too bad.

They've been fighting over it for two years and its been pretty nasty. The coin split was based on this. I think other coins are better geared towards daily purchases.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:33:28
No split because it hasn't mined a block yet but it has diverged.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:26:03
I wouldn't unless you have money to burn. It'll probably correct soon. It's possible that it keeps going but it is a high risk investment and it is at an all time high, the worst time to jump in. If you are just thinking about it now then it is just a reaction to the current hype. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:15:21

I mined for a while and did ok but then I realised that I could just buy the coins for a bit of added cost but less stress. If I had really committed and refined it then maybe it would have been worth the problems that go with it.

It is a very volatile investment and things will probably change drastically in the next few years. If they get wrapped up in hype easily then the volatility could affect them emotionally and not be worth it. I never suggest anyone buy it unless they want to understand how it works or they have a specific use case. I bought in during 2013 at $900 and then it went down to $250 over a couple years. The time to buy is when everyone else is selling, not now.

I think a lot of Bitcoiners would agree with him. I think the worst thing to happen to bitcoin is the rise of the price and it getting swamped with people who can't see past the numbers. I also advise people to avoid it unless they want to play around with it or to have some just in case.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:51:45
Be patient and stick to your plan. It'll go up and down so don't let it affect your emotions. The less you pay attention to it the better. [Remember this]( When it takes off, just let it go. Invest in life and relationships and don't put all your hope in it.

I made an automated trading platform for poloniex and I basically broke even. The fees ate my profit. The nice thing about using a system is that it removes the element of emotion which is huge in trading. You trust the math and just let it do its thing. Just trading on whims, you would probably lose money. Even if you found a reliable system, the fees are brutal.
If you trade enough volume on poloniex then they give you a discount on fees so I know that some high volume traders are making a killing on all the ups and downs.

and then it'll take half a day to mine the first one and bring the difficulty down
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:44:27
I don't think so. I think when the price goes up, more miners jump in which leads to a difficulty rise.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:30:27
It's no longer being geared towards that. No more coffees with bitcoin. I figure another coin will end up being used for cheap transactions and bitcoin will be a longer term store of value.

My parents were given some stock about twenty years ago. It drove them batty. They had spent most of their lives with very little money so now having something that changed daily drove them nuts. They sold pretty quick because it was just to stressful. Not having experience with volatile investments can be tough.
If you are over invested then these price moves can be too much. The best way to approach it is to accept that it could easily go to zero and then just ignore it. If it does then you are out but if it doesn't then you profit. A %20 drop isn't uncommon for bitcoin. This is just standard price movements for this type of volatile asset. Its better to think long term.  Its also better to have a logical plan so you don't react on emotion. Will you hold indefinitely or will you cash out at certain price to protect some of the investment. Then just follow your plan and remain detached. The goal is to not allow it to affect you emotionally. Enjoy your life and focus on more important things like family, friends, work etc. Place your hope in bettering yourself and doing good and try to see bitcoin as some secondary strategy that may not lead to anything.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:48:21

They measure the value of dollars by comparing it to a basket of goods, [Consumer price index]( This is how they measure inflation, if that basket costs more next year then the value of money has decreased. USD is created every year and this helps keep us out of recessions so who knows what will happen if bitcoin gets wide usage.

15% isn't too bad. If you are holding long term then it doesn't matter so much. it could go to 1000 for a year and be 10000 and couple years later. going down fast means it can go up fast too.

Maybe find a wordpress plugin that deals with api's?

Bitcoin and blockchain technology are two different things blockchain tech will continue to evolve but bitcoins future is not guaranteed. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:27:53
Might be hard with wordpress. To use an api use Curl. I made one that did automatic trading a while ago using php. All of the exchanges have guides and usually code samples that show you how to get set up. Then you can customize their code to what you want it to do.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:47:13
i like that you can see bitfinex, bitstamp and gdax at the same time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:56:00
If you install the main bitcoin wallet on your computer it will connect to the bitcoin network. It will generate some addresses that bitcoin can be sent to. So say someone sends you bitcoin, or you send some money to an exchange, buy some and then send it to your wallet. Now you control an address that has an amount of bitcoin attached to it. This is written into the blockchain that it happened so it is forever recorded. Now if you want to send it to another address, say a friend or someone bought some from you, then you use the wallet to make a new transaction. The wallet sends the transaction throughout the network and whatever miner generates the next block includes it in that block. The network doesn't know who is buying or selling, it only knows what addresses are involved. The benefit of this is that your identity isn't attached to an address. When you have a bank account with an amount of money attached to it, it is attached to your identity.

@_date: 2017-11-03 05:00:50
[agreed]( But I don't think its possible for people not to get burned at this point. The hype train is in full force and even without it, looking at the price chart will play games with anybodies mind. At some point there will be a correction and it could last for years. It's happened before.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:03:50
Bitcoin has been known to go down for years at a time so this probably won't happen.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:23:29
or somewhere in between or higher
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:29:08
Sounds like it was a purchase based on emotion. If you can afford this then you can just ignore it for 5 years. The decision was already made so you might as well stick it out. It'll likely go higher later. The real cost of bitcoin investing is stress and lost time focusing on the price. The people who do well are the ones who don't care and just ignore the price for long periods of time. You should research risky and volatile investments because most people enter them knowing that the asset will probably drop below their purchase price for long periods anyways.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:46:37
When I got into bitcoin there was an explosion of small shops accepting bitcoin for purchases. Coffee shops etc where trying it out but most of them have stopped because there is no real benefit to accepting it. They don't get a lot of increased traffic and the fees make it difficult to make small purchases. [examples]( I love the technology behind bitcoin and stating something that is generally agree upon in the bitcoin community shouldn't be seen as complaining. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:08:35
Probably institutions at this point

This is one of those phrases that I've never heard any one say seriously but everybody believes that everyone is saying it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:49:40
Example of people saying this?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:48:42
I'm always willing to let it go to zero and fully expect it to. I figure I'll hold it until it's worth selling or it dies. The weird thing about bitcoin is that everybody just wants to own some in case. If the price tanks tomorrow people will buy it up because now they get the chance that they thought they missed. If it actually dies and a major flaw is found then people will buy for nostalgia. I fully expect it drop by a few thousand along the way and basically don't care. If it drops below 1000 then I might think that something is wrong but even when it tanks it can come up just as easily or in a year or two.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:24:23
All sorts of stuff. But prices going up and down is pretty normal.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:18:06
High risk, nobody knows. I bought a year ago but I won't buy now, doesn't mean it won't go up though. You have to decide what kind of risk you are willing to take. If it goes to 1000 in a month or a year, how bad will it affect you?
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:16:37
Then everyone complains that it makes people think that a bitcoin is a coin or an undivisible unit.

@_date: 2017-11-02 11:01:37
Anybody who looks at past opportunities can see chances to have millions by now. If I only invested in Yahoo, or my friends start up etc. Every trader on wall street can do the same but why stress yourself out over it. 
If you didn't sell at 23 then you probably would have at 100. If not 100 then probably 500. Or you'd sell now and maybe its more in a year. 
I  checked a lottery ticket for a guy up north once and he won 160,000. He was running around like it was the best day of his life. I saw him a year later and he was back to work, 50 lbs heavier and miserable. 
I would focus on life and relationships. Money comes and goes but there actually are better things in life even though it sounds cliche. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:44:52
It took work but I convinced myself that it would go to zero. I didn't want to have any hope in it so that I would still work hard towards other things I wanted in life like programming. Same reason I quit playing video games, they give you a false sense of hope and a false sense of accomplishment. I invested after the 1300 rush in 2013 so I got to watch it drop for two years as well.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:17:54
The post was about capital flight. And of course there is going to be miners switching with the price going up like this.

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:45:58
It could go up or it could go down. Nobody knows. But the real success of bitcoin isn't in the price, its in the problems it solves and practical usage. i think the best case for bitcoin usage could actually be bad for the price, a use case that caused people to bring their coins out of storage and spend them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:32:01
When the price goes up like this, people decide to take some profit. It hits a point where they want to cash out and buy a deck or a yacht so they sell.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:46:53
Everybody has their own reason for buying and the reasons aren't reliant on what some people think it's purpose is. Blockchain is a technology in the same sense that capacitors are a technology. You can use it for whatever you want regardless of what the inventors or developers say the purpose is.
There is a debate over whether bitcoin should be a store of value or something that you buy coffee with. It's sort of developing over time so people are just watching to see what happens and see what good uses come out of it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:05:21
If he actually did it, and if he held on. I can't imagine the stress not getting to most people in that situation.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:19:21
I thought this when it hit 1300. I just wanted it to come back down because i thought I had missed my chance. Then it slowly dropped for two years and when it hit 250 I didn't want it anymore. Price changes do funny things to your mind.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:59:07
Not much else you can do. Just sit and watch the twists and turns.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:25:50
I got interested in bitcoin after it surged to 1300. There was so much hype that i wanted some but i thought I had missed the boat. I always told myself that if it came back down i would buy a lot. After a couple years of the price dropping it was at 250. I realized I could buy a whole bitcoin now but it seemed like it was toast so I didn't want one anymore. Its amazing what the price does to your mind.

They are two totally different things so there is no guarantee that they will follow the same path. It's harder to determine some fundamental value to bitcoin where as the stock market has a lot of reliable formulas to determine a fundamental value of a company. there are similarities as well though in the sense that people are buying into potential future utility.

Getting help isn't plagiarism. Nobody expects a 16 year old to code up an app in total isolation. A developer can be someone who orchestrates the work. I think people were happy to see her attempting something large scale and coming to an end product. Are you this critical of kids drawings or crafts? She was probably very proud of what she had done regardless of the help involved. Whats the difference between what she got help for and importing a library, is that plagiarism if you say you coded a project but import others code?

This community has become so toxic. It used to be that Bitcoin was a great technology that could sell itself. People would come here and talk about the tech. Now all people look at is the price. The reason people think it is a scam is because of these pushy sales tactics. This place has become like a used car lot. Nobody can be honest because we are just here to pump it. This place has turned off more people than it has attracted because people can smell the insincerity. 
Let people call it a scam. Why do you care what they think about it? If you want some then buy it, if you don't then don't. It doesn't need this cheerleading all the time. People see this desperate attempt to sell it and it seems like a scam to them, I can't blame them. I have been here for years and many people have been turned off by what has become of this place. 
So you want the price to rise out of spite now because anyone who doesn't jump on the bandwagon is our enemy. Bitcoin is supposed to be a technology that helps everyone, not just hodlers. But you'll get your upvotes and this place will get a little bit spammier. You guys can hold up your signs on the news and paint everyone who doesn't join your cult as losers. Rational people will slowly leave your ranks and you won't even notice because of the sound of the chorus.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:58:06
No, you have to hodldlrl or you suck. If you have ever sold any ever  then you have failed at life even though every transaction has a buyer and a seller and this happens thousands of times a day which creates a healthy market.

I think a lot of people think it is just a program that somebody made that acts like money. It's hard to explain cryptographically secure protocols or how being decentralized affects a system. there were also a lot promises made earlier on about how bitcoin could be used like money but it became clear that it wasn't as user friendly as people thought. I can't imagine my grandma calculating user fees based on the mempool or backing up a wallet without help.

Ya, I just like saying it once in a while. I used to say the same thing 4 years ago and the responses were similar. To be honest I didn't mean for it to coincide with today's drop which does seem more panic like.

What you guys think is fud is just normal people thinking

When bitcoin forks it essentially turns into two coins. If you owned bitcoin and controlled the keys before the fork then you now have that amount of both coins.

Just seems like everything is coordinated with Goldman Sach's prediction about $2200, Warren Buffet's remark and then China. Pretty sure they want in now and the only way is to cause a panic and pick it up quietly.

Wouldn't they have made a profit?

Who is saying it is dead?

I'll wait and see what happens after all the fork stuff before I accept the new price, see what sticks.

When it was at 400, it had gone down steadily for two years. It seemed like it wasn't going to recover and most of the hype had died out. The time when you should buy is usually the time when you don't really want to anymore.

I always expect it to crash just so I don't get disappointed.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:00:10
So anyone who shorted in the low 5000's just got wrecked I imagine.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:01:42
5000's were boring anyways.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:09:04
half before half after? Who knows. Price will probably move after. If you buy before then you get both coins if you buy after then you might get a better or worse price.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:48:11
If you know what they know then they want you to know. Margin Call is a good movie about Goldman Sachs. After 2013 bitcoin dropped for two years so you never know when it is going to recover. No one knows the future and it is still a highly speculative investment. [This]( is a good read.
Now may be a great time to buy or a great time to sell and pick up down the road. No one really knows. just don't spend more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:54:25
Doubt anyone took it seriously anyways.

Ir wasn't sustainable. It was the sinkhole the sucked all the bitcoin excitement in. But eventually people had realise that throwing money at it was just throwing money at the devs who were selling their stash.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:46:24
The amount of bitcoins mined will be smaller too so the transaction fees may be more of a draw long before the coins stop being produced.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:10:27
Whatever price you buy it at, expect it to drop below it. Don't worry about it as it is impossible to predict the bottom. Dips are good to buy in, just don't wait forever.

Is it the hype that is prompting this decision? Did you want some last week? Nobody really knows what will happen so its really up to you. Just be willing to live with the consequences.

is this dangerous information?
@_date: 2017-09-09 10:00:42
I don't think they realize the size of these sells. It's not weak hands that drop millions, its calculated investors who know when and why to sell.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:38:09
Normally they just say it is high risk which it is

The fallacy I see here most often is that this sub is all of the bitcoin users. People see the price fall and they run here to tell everyone to stop panicking as if this is the central hub for bitcoin users. 
If everyone here sold then buyers would still exist to make a market. The benefit would be that people would realise that all of their effort spent here trying to get people to buy is wasted and isn't a huge driving force behind the price of bitcoin. It would be stress relieving exercise. 
The price of Bitcoin exists outside of this place and the only thing accomplishes is making new visitors think that Bitcoin is a scam since most people here sell it like a used car.
Free your mind from the stress of hope in a volatile asset. Bitcoin is beyond your reach and is going to do what it is going to do.

Currency exchange rate for the win!
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:41:42
Uhhhh? $1000 is 66% of present value. Present value is 50% of $1000.
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:46:30
Fine. Present value is %150 of $1000.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:02:20
I'm looking to the next crash and recovery before I get excited.
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:30:42
$1000 is %66 of $1500
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:25:52
So roughly .002 btc per bitcoin: 30.7 / 14,000
and .014 per transaction: 30.7 / 2,152: worth $32.20
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:43:19
Maybe they get offered a large sum to shut it down. It is ransomware.
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:38:59
Because there is less demand. At any given time there are people who want to buy bitcoin and people who want to sell. If the amount of bitcoin that people want to sell increases then the price goes down. if the amount of bitcoin that people want to buy increases then the price goes up. all currencies have a relative value in relation to other currencies. When we talk about the price of bitcoin in dollars we are talking about the relative value of bitcoin and dollars. same as if you talked about Canadian dollars relative to american dollars. You would be talking about an exchange rate. when you see the price of bitcoin you are looking at an exchange rate.

It is also important to note that one bitcoin is worth more than anything worth $1990 and is worth more than anything that has never been worth more than $1990 ever has been.

Also, sorry to whoever bought at 2700. I don't want to seem insensitive to your loss.

This poor coin seems terrified everytime it goes up
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:13:09
I get in the mindset that $100 move is a big thing but as it gets higher I'm trying to change how I think about it.
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:35:11
The bitcoin guy is looking up at 1800 while falling backwards.
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:15:10
Alright, I understand the error of my ways. $1000 is $500 down which is 33% of $1500. We were at $1500 so I should have valued the difference in relation to the current price since that was the context in which we were talking. I have reported myself to the authorities and they are on their way. When I am done with rehabilitation then I will be able to correctly apply percentages to reddit comments.
@_date: 2017-05-10 06:38:07
You never really know when is good. It could go up or it could go down. Bitcoin is very volatile so the price could be very different a week from now. Cost dollar averaging seems to work good for people. Just buy a little bit every month or something.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:30:15

To me Bitcoin is still an experiment. Its paving the way for others to see what unforeseen problems exist. This fork is a little experiment to see what happens under different development paths. I don't have any strong opinions of the matter but I'm happy to see where this all goes because it is information that will be available to future developers.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:20:32
Lots of red on poloniex. It just means that there is a relative shift of funds from alts to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:30:13
If time travel is possible then are the hashes safe? Could you break the blockchain? Seems like even with future knowledge you couldn't crack someones private key unless there is some decent quantum computers there.
Also, maybe Satoshi stole some future technology, came back in time to implement it himself and mined a good chunk before heading back to the future.

If you are feeling [nostalgic](
@_date: 2019-05-18 05:59:58
Because it is part of the landscape. It tells you something.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:38:36
The longer it took for this inevitable dip the worse it would have been for new investors. This is just bitcoins way of welcoming the newcomers and reminding people to be cautious because it can bite.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:46:54
Don't worry, probably not real.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:23:58
Because you are intentionally trying to get people to spend money based on fear. Your only concern is raising the value of an asset you hold (I assume) and you are looking to use people's weaknesses and manipulate them to buy something that may or may not benefit their lives. I guarantee you that people come to this sub and leave thinking that bitcoin is a scam because all they see is insincere garbage like this. A lot of people got burned on the last pop and it was the hype that this place was complicit in spreading that was partly responsible. 
[Here]( is a reasonable post from a year ago. It is better to encourage well thought out investing rather than emotional and sporadic investing. The less people that get burned by bitcoin now, the better and more useful it will be in the future.
I try to tell myself that I am not involved in a scammy movement but stuff like this makes me wonder. I'd like to think that Bitcoin is good for people and their decisions are encouraged to be rational and well thought out.
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:55:18
bitcoin has no value if no one ever spends it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:42:53
It'll bounce off of a significant price more often than punch through. Traders know this so they try to sell there which makes it more likely to bounce. It'll have to take a few runs at it. If it just keeps bouncing then it'll lose steam for a while as traders think it's not ready to break through.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:19:44
It takes a nap. It's been through a lot.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:44:54
Markets act unpredictably. 
Traders knew that everyone was expecting the past to repeat itself so that may have been a part of trader strategies. 
People are getting out of Binance coins and selling them for bitcoins because the hack spooked them. 
People are taking a serious look at what makes a coin truly valuable and are realising that most crap coins are indeed crap.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:59:16
The slow filtering affect of the market. Old holders cash out, weak hands fold, new investors arrive with hope in their eyes. The slow grinding effect of the ups and down leaves bitcoin in the hands where they are meant to be.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:44:36
This just in: Bitcoin could be worth a million billion dollars if it happens to go that high. But if it doesn't then it won't.

You'll be seeing these for decades every time the price dips.
