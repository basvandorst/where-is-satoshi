Playing this game for 2 minutes made me more angry than my bike being stolen when I was 12, and I loved that bike, I had it for a bit more than a week.

I'm mostly just lurking this subreddit out of curiosity but I don't think physical currency will be replaced in a long time.
It is simple and reliable, it can't be hacked and only be stolen if it is taken directly from you. Bitcoin is nice but I don't think it will ever spread that much that it will replace the dollar or euro.
Thats what people said about the CD as well, but that doesn't change my opinion.

hmmm. I have no idea how that kinda stuff works. Usually when I sell something (like my car or whatever) I give them my bank account number and they send me the money there. You can't do anything with that number. Do you have a different system in the states by chance?

You made it clear to her that this is actually a bribery and not a trade.

I won't, but thanks for reminding me (and hopefully also the silent lurkers) to never risk anything.

I could sell a product for $ or € and make just as much money and have a bigger customer range, but what I mean is making money by buying and selling Bitcoins.

Say you didn't mean to bribe her and just wanted to be nice since it wasn't enough money and you had it leftover. I don't think it is a huge deal.

When I used tor for the first time NoScript was installed and everything blocked. I could imagine many people enabled JavaScript because it makes it more user friendly but that would be a pretty dumb move when using Tor.

Oh sounds.... shitty.

Fuck I should have bought when I first heard about Bitcoin. I would be in this picture now.

Well I'm talking about relatively easy. It would be easier than cleaning offices on saturdays while working 40 hours a week.

Thats kinda what I hoped for to happen to me. I think I will start with a small amount of money as soon as there is another low and see what happens.

WHAT? you DON'T HAVE a separation of Bank and State?
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:07:50
But that's what I want to do.
