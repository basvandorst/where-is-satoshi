I don't think a Bitcoin startup could use a mathematician (let alone one of the best in the world), unless they are doing something super weird. A more established company can always benefit from statistics and that kind of thing, but it wouldn't be a startup's priority.
And mathematicians will probably pick research every time, and is probably what the NSA wants them to do. And are probably paid a sum that a startup could never afford. Remember that these agencies have virtually unlimited resources. Not only do they not spend their own money (it's the taxpayer money), they even create illegal sources of income.

Normally you would only tell the wallet "receive money" or "create a new address" , which you copy and give it to whoever wants to send you money. Behind the scenes the wallet will manage the private key for that address so that you can spend from it when you want to.
You only need a lot of space if you are going to run a full node or if you want to use Armory (I use Armory because it has a ton of features). For something fast, easy and secure use Electrum. Both Electrum and Armory are deterministic wallets, meaning you only need to back them up once, as they will always creat the same keys for a given seed (what you back up is the seed).
If you are going to use this for savings, remember that you have to use cold storage, as no online machine can ever be safe enough (unless you use multi-signature, which isn't very spread yet. They say 2014 will be the year of multi-sig). The basic idea is that your keys never leave your offline machine. In your online machine you have a watch-only copy of the wallet that lets you watch your balance. When you want to spend you create an unsigned transaction, move it to the offline machine with a USB pendrive, sign it, and then broadcast it with your online machine. Sounds complicated but it's easy, in fact I have just done so to refill my hot (online) web wallet. It took a minute and I'm done for a few months.

He accepted over 6000 BTC in donations for the forum and kept them all for himself. The forum got hacked because he can't even update the damned software and is still a piece of garbage.
He also [bought the wiki from Mark Karpeles]( to monopolize all of our channels of communication and all of a sudden some links were replaced by links to phishing websites. [People got their money stolen that way](
Oh and he continued to offer himself to hold coins for other donations like the one to support CoinJoin. I don't know what happened with that, I never donated again to anything in which Theymos was involved in any way.

I didn't say wallet, I said scheme. You can simply use the reference client if you want, create three keys, each one on a different machine, and then create a multi-signature address with them. Some companies, like those Bitcoin investment trusts that are spawning, use that. Especially after the NeoBee fiasco.

1 BTC (bitcoin) = 1,000 mBTC (millibitcoins) = 1,000,000 uBTC (microbitcoins or bits. The foundation also proposed using the notation XBT) = 100,000,000 satoshis
As the price of one bitcoin goes up, we will start using smaller units.

Darkcoin has weak anonymity (less than CoinJoin because they added that masternode nonsense) and is closed source. Its creator said he would add ring signatures like Monero, but then backed off because he realized he was out of his depth (he's not a cryptographer). Good luck with that.

Bitcoin's history:  Anonymous genius made a scientific breakthrough by solving a really hard problem everyone in the field though was impossible. Created a first of its kind decentralized digital currency, made it open source for everyone to improve it, people all over the world started using it, all kinds of experts including top-notch programmers and cryptographers started working on it and improving its security and functionality. Today it has a 7bn market cap, with tons of merchants accepting it, including huge companies like the 27bn Dish, and tons of venture capital invested. Its network is stronger than ever, with over [80 Ph/s]( securing it, which is a computational power never seen before. On top of being very secure, it still has A LOT of room for growth. It could still go up *at least* 100x, making it a great investment. Yes, a currency can be an investment, no matter what tries to make you believe. Inflationary fiat is not the definition of currency, just a very bad type of currency.
Dogecoin's history: Some dude, like [many others]( copy/pasted Bitcoin's code while drunk on a Friday night (he said that himself), added a cute dog picture, made it inflationary, and created a subreddit for it. The subreddit was unreadable at first, but like many other short lived copycoins it spiked, so they decided to make it readable as it could result in a lot of easy bitcoins for its creators and early gamblers. Fans of the meme jumped in (mostly kids who can't even afford a T-shirt, according to one of the few dogecoin merchants), the coin spiked even more (something common and easy when a coin is worthless), and started their deceiving marketing campaign and vote-rigging all over reddit, and especially targeted We suffered their spam for months (and we still do to some degree), and some technically challenged people fell for it. Now the coin has been going downhill (went down from like 276 satoshis to 60 satoshis) like a textbook copycoin, and is soon to suffer a death by a thousand forks due to the lack of incentives for miners, just like Feathercoin and many others.
Make your own conclusions.

Redundant coins must die. They hurt the crypto ecosystem by making people lose faith. Look at Feathercoin. What will people whose first contact with the cryptocurrency world was Feathercoin think the next time someone tells them to accept/use a cryptocoin (eg: Bitcoin)? "Fuck off" they are gonna say, "I already got burned by those things. They are a scam, anyone can create one."
Or, what I have actually heard multiple times: "There are too many different coins and I don't know which one to use. Maybe in the future."
Feathercoin had lots of enthusiasts just like dogecoin. They spammed everything, and they actually have at least *some* innovation, in that they integrated a market into coin. And now they are gone, for the same reasons dogecoin will be gone soon.
And of course copycoins never tell people that there is a much bigger, much more reliable coin out there. They tell the story as if Feathercoin/Dogecoin/Whatever came out of nowhere. They never ever mention the scientific breakthrough that occurred in 2008 with Satoshi's white paper and in 2009 with the first working implementation.

Each tradeoff is different and has to be analyzed individually. It's not always just "more complex code". It can be more bandwidth, more processing, more disk space, etc. One example is Monero: it brings true decentralized anonymity (without the masternodes nonsense, just pure cryptography), but at the cost of a larger blockchain. Whether this is a problem remains to be seen.

The only reason you would want to make miners happy is if the PoW scheme stays the same: You need them to continue securing the network. If 51% of them are mad and their mining gear is still relevant, you are going to have a bad time. Same if 100% of them simply leave, leaving the network unsecured. But if you are switching to something different, you don't need them. In OP's case we want them to stay because their mining gear will still work, but the pools landscape will be a lot different because now individual miners will be able to steal from pools, which will drive everyone to solo mining or small pools made of only trusted members. In that landscape Ghash won't have 51% anymore, and we will be safer than we are now. The only problem is it will become more like a lottery, unless someone solves the variance issue.

An open-source desktop program that can connect to third party web wallets (maybe using a special protocol or standard API for this, someone could create a BIP) to sign multi-sig transactions. We should be able to input our own keys, in case we want to create some of them offline. Typically it should be 2-of-3 (with one of the keys printed and stored in a safe place), not 2-of-2.
This way we can be sure the program won't send all our keys to the web wallet (be it during key creation or afterwards) if they go rogue.

You are confusing (intentionally or not) monetary inflation with the more common price inflation. Bitcoin is deflationary, because prices denominated in Bitcoin go down over time. If you want to talk about monetary inflation you have to be clear about it, because it's less common and less relevant. Most of the time people want to know if their purchasing power goes up or down, not the inner workings of the currency.

To be honest you don't seem to have understood the issue at all. For instance, you believe that altcoins are less centralized, when in reality half of them (eg: PoS coins like Peercoin) need to have every block signed by its dev, because they have been successfully attacked and haven't yet found another way to survive, and the other half are just like Bitcoin but with less adoption, less security, less everything.
I'm not closing my eyes, but I'm not losing my mind like you, and like all the other people that lose their mind every year for the same thing. I'm reading about actual problems and actual proposals, like this one for example: 
In the meantime, rest assured that Bitcoin won't magically explode and die, even if someone controlling 51% of the hashrate attacked it. Core devs explained multiple things that can be done in such an event. The blockchain won't just vanish. Yes, an attack could discredit Bitcoin, slow its adoption, and delay the moon a few years. So what? Do you have any ideas, other than telling others to do something about it?

Monero has had a fair launch and distribution, has been open source from the beginning, and has been endorsed by many Bitcoin early adopters, so it's now the most popular one from that family and has the highest market cap.

That security advice is only good if you don't need the upsides of the brain wallet. For example, what good is a paper wallet if they start searching for those at the borders?
Another example: If there weren't any risks in keeping my private keys online, encrypted paper wallets would be bad too.
Besides, if you can't remember a good passphrase for your brain wallet, how are you going to remember a good passphrase for your encrypted paper wallet? If the password is bad enough, and I bet that's what most people will use, the KDF from BIP38 won't help.

I'm a code wizard lvl 99 and can afford a few cheap servers indefinitely, but I think we should start with a sub for now. Also, it wouldn't be cool if we pull a massive effort creating a great independent site and bring everyone there, just to suddenly get the news that someone created a decentralized forum.
I'll write the bots, invite honest bitcoiners like you as mods with ~~license to kill~~ permission to ban trolls, and see what happens. Worst case scenario we'll have a not very populated sub, but free of trolls and shitcoiners, to read the news.
If it kind of works maybe then we can create a multi-sig address among the mods to collect funds for an independent site, or even a decentralized one.

Except PoS is not an "alternative". It's not a decentralized consensus system like PoW. You can't have a PoS coin that is both decentralized and secure. That's why all PoS coins are 100% centralized and resort to either checkpoints or whack-a-mole style security patches.

That's why you should withdraw any coins you have in services like Coinbase as soon as you buy or receive them.

Price inflation or monetary inflation?
In terms of price inflation, everyone knows the USD has been consistently losing 2% of its purchasing power every year for the past what, 20 years? While Bitcoin's price has been going up about 10x every year for the past 5 years.
In terms of monetary inflation, well... I'll just leave this here:

The "nothing at stake" problem, in a nutshell, means that it doesn't cost anything to attack its network, because there's nothing at stake (ie. no electricity was needed). An attacker can simply mine all the forks he likes in parallel, because it doesn't cost him electricity. He doesn't even have to own the coins at the moment of the attack. He can sell them and *then* start an attack using as a starting point the previous block.
Bitcoin with all its flaws, at least costs millions to be attacked. It also improves constantly, and eventually will become pretty damn robust.

The seed is used to generate always the same private keys, and with those it can generate the addresses. Once it has the addresses it just looks them up in the blockchain and with that it knows all the transactions and calculates your balance. I guess when you restore the wallet, it will continue generating keys and addresses until it finds unused addresses, then it stops. If it stops in the wrong place I guess you can manually tell it to generate more keys. At least that's how it works in Armory. Sometimes, when I want to send coins to cold storage, to be extra cautions I check that the address generated in the online machine can also be generated in the offline machine.

Did you find about Bitcoin at $1 and predicted it would go up to $500 and stay there? Or you just happened to find Bitcoin at this point ($500), and for some sort of pessimistic bias you simply assume it can't continue making 10x jumps like before?
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:26:07
It's a behavior of the wallet, not the protocol. That's why you should use a deterministic wallet: back up once, be safe forever. The official wallet now backs up 100 keys in advance I think, but I still wouldn't recommend it. That's another reason altcoins suck: They don't have Armory, Electrum, etc.

If you want real innovation and actual anonymity, search for coins based on the [Cryptonote]( technology. They are not Bitcoin clones, but use the blockchain technology. The current favorite is [Monero]( because of its fair launch and distribution, and its strong dev team.

The community is as real as any other subreddit's community but, like I said, that's not enough to stop people from doing what's in his own best interest.

Again, even if that was true, they don't even have enough to buy a T-shirt and most of them are just kids. There is no economy there.
And using dogecoin is no more fun than using any other cryptocurrency. In fact I would say Bitcoin is much more fun, because they don't even have interesting things like Electrum, Armory, GreenAddress, Trezor, Robocoin/Lamassu, etc., and dogecoin is accepted nowhere.

Most altcoins are redundant, especially the ones you mentioned, so I would simply stick to Bitcoin.
But if you absolutely have to add an altcoin, at least go with one that isn't yet another worthless Bitcoin clone. For example, you could add [Monero](
- true decentralized anonymity thanks to ring signatures. It's even more anonymous than CoinJoin (and therefore more anonymous than Darkcoin), according to Gregory Maxwell (Bitcoin core dev and creator of CoinJoin)
- based on the [cryptonote]( technology
- fair launch and distribution
- really strong, multi-disciplinary team
- parnership with [I2P](
- very cheap at the moment because it's pretty new
- CPU friendly thanks to Cryptonight algorithm, but can also be mined with GPU (though it doesn't give a huge advantage over CPU)
- lots of [Bitcoin early adopters]( (including myself) like it, because it's the first time we see some actual innovation in the altcoins world
- not a Bitcoin clone, it's a fork of the now dying Bytecoin wich was a complete rewrite and quite innovative unlike most altcoins. Bytecoin failed because it was mined in secret by a few individuals and also its devs left to other projects. As you can see in coinmarketcap, it has been flagged as "significantly premined".
- popular altcoin exchanges are starting to trade it, eg: Mintpal, Bittrex, etc.

A benevolent monopoly would be considered an attack, and the network would react. And it's still much better because even with a monopoly, you don't get to control all the full nodes and the code, so you can't change the protocol arbitrarily, among other differences.

Don't be lazy, be careful when doing this. Remember that guy who decided to move everything to cold storage, and when he did that a malicious plugin that was sitting on his browser changed the address and stole everything. Use a fresh browser install.
5 BTC is too much IMO, especially if it's 100% of your BTC holdings. You should only have online what you are going to spend in meals, tipping, etc. during this week or month at most.
Also, instead of Coinbase you should use Greenaddress.it, which is the most secure online wallet. Their developers seem to be very capable, active, open and honest, and the scheme they have chosen (2-of-2 multi-signature) seems to be both secure and very convenient.
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:09:26

The problem is not that they are being selfish, the problem is they are being idiotic. Satoshi failed to predict the influx of suicidal miners who can't math.
Also, ASIC manufacturer and miner BitFury said they will move hashing power away from Ghash, and this is obviously because they are afraid we might be forced to introduce a change in the protocol that renders their ASICs useless, effectively destroying their business. Smart selfishness works fine.

But why can't we create another sub, where all its mods are true bitcoiners (tm)? ie. no fraudsters, no trolls, no statists, no shitcoiners, etc.
I'm in the process of doing just that. I won't just create the sub, I think if we use several ways for promoting it we can make it take off.
Unfortunately my PM's are not reaching destination for some reason :S.
A separate website or even a decentralized forum is definitely needed, but I think a sub with smarter and more honest mods is a necessary first step. If one day someone creates the decentralized bitcoin forum, we can promote it there.
I still don't see how changing to HN-style would help. Regular users can't even downvote unless they have a lot of karma, which you can only gain with submissions.

The only altcoin that I consider valuable is [Monero](
- fair launch and distribution
- really strong, multi-disciplinary team
- parnership with [I2P](
- based on the [cryptonote]( technology
- true decentralized anonymity thanks to ring signatures. It's even more anonymous than CoinJoin (and therefore more anonymous than Darkcoin), according to Gregory Maxwell (Bitcoin core dev and creator of CoinJoin)
- very cheap at the moment because it's pretty new
- CPU friendly thanks to Cryptonight algorithm, but can also be mined with GPU (though it doesn't give a huge advantage over CPU)
- lots of [Bitcoin early adopters]( (including myself) like it, because it's the first time we see some actual innovation in the altcoins world
- not a Bitcoin clone, it's a fork of the now dying Bytecoin wich was a complete rewrite and quite innovative unlike most altcoins. Bytecoin failed because it was mined in secret by a few individuals and also its devs left to other projects. As you can see in coinmarketcap, it has been flagged as "significantly premined".

Everything changes in value over time.
And something that has more variance that in the long term goes up is definitely a better store of value than something with less variance that in the long term goes down.
Keep your wealth in USD and after 10 years you will have lost *at least* 20% of it. Or maybe even 100% if you kept it in a bank.
Keep your wealth in sound money and after 10 years you will be very happy.

10 minutes seems to be the optimal time. Lower than that could cause scaling troubles in such a distributed system, and it's not needed anyway.

So far the modus opearandi has always been like this:
- Go to  to expose the idea
- Have the idea trashed by actual experts
- Get angry and say bitocoin core devs know nothing
- Implement them anyway
- Make lots of promises
- Try to convince idiots to buy the insecure coin
- Months/year later the coin is still crap.

Do you still not understand that this thread is about a technology, not about any particular coin? I guess pumpers like you can't tell the difference, and can't possibly have an intellectual debate without asking themselves "What should I buy then?".


It's hilarious that you think I'm a pumper, when most people here know I have been bashing all altcoins for years, which has made me lots of enemies. Ask about me in for instance. It's also quite hypocritical, considering all you talk about is Darkcoin, even though there is no real innovation in it and is the only coin that includes closed source code, effectively making it one of the worst coins available.

I don't know what you mean. And where did I say that?


Do you realize it's based on a complete rewrite and new technology? It's not a copy/paste of Bitcoin like Darkcoin. That's why there isn't yet a wallet average Joes like you can use.


It's insane to what extent pumpers will try to stick to their little "investment" and try to convince themselves and everyone else that it's the greatest thing ever. I wonder what else (if anything) goes through your head when you dismiss new technological achievements, like you were even qualified.

No they don't "understand this". And I suggest doing basic math or basic reading.
Can you explain why are they even mining? If you are dumb or lazy, you are better off simply buying coins and sitting on them, instead of going full retard, losing money, and hurting the network.
Seems like Satoshi failed to predict the influx of retards that would start mining without knowing the first thing about Bitcoin, effectively giving money away to a single entity for no good reason.

@_date: 2014-07-29 20:44:40
I think it's the opposite: People have had coins stolen using "convenient" desktop and mobile wallets too, no matter if they were encrypted. But I have never seen someone saying "my Armory cold storage got hacked!".
You say the barrier of entry is high, as if you were comparing it to an alternative with the same security. But no, you are comparing it to your average Windows-full-of-virus desktop wallet.
If you can install an OS, you can use Armory. If there is anything difficult in using Armory's cold storage, it's because you have to learn what the heck is cold storage, so that signing the transactions makes sense. So yeah, learning new things like Bitcoin is more difficult than not learning anything. And Armory's cold storage and multi-signature is easier than Electrum's, because it actually has an UI for that. But apparently not having one is better in your opinion?

That's retarded, double-spend attempts have always happened, and has nothing to do with GHash or a problem in Bitcoin's security. For example, every time new coins arrive to a known brain wallet, all of the brain wallet "miners" will try to spend them at the same time, generating many double-spend attempts.
If a website can show you something might be a double-spend, then it won't be a double-spend, because nobody will accept it.

Yes the PoS problem affects all PoS coins. Some tie it to its PoW, some use checkpoints. Not sure whether Nxt is using checkpoints though, I'm not looking into Nxt's details because it's not interesting anyway.
If someone actually created a way to secure the network without using a lot of power I would be cheering it, but so far PoS doesn't seem to be a solution.

That's bullshit. PoS can never be secure because of the "nothing at stake" problem. That's the reason Peercoin was successfully attacked and had to start using checkpoints, meaning it's 100% centralized and dependent on its dev. All the blocks have to be signed by him.

How can you say it's interesting and at the same time admit that you can mine all forks at the same time? It's simply not an alternative to PoW. It can't be decentralized and secure at the same time. That's why PoS is centralized. You might as well say "Paypal is interesting".

Keep in mind that the paper backup is not encrypted, so writing down the encryption password is kind of pointless. And don't let anyone get near that paper backup. You should consider using a n-of-m scheme instead (Armory lets you do that).

Nice argument. Let me guess, you came from @_date: 2014-05-24 13:01:37
The only thing that Darkcoin can do for Bitcoin is pressure it to make CoinJoin part of the core. But that can only happen if core devs thinks it won't affect the network or economy in a bad way or whatever. These kinds of things are still being researched as far as I know. And Darkcoin didn't create anything new. Keep in mind that the whole point of CoinJoin (created by a Bitcoin core dev) was that it was not necessary to create a new coin, but there you have it: some asshole copy/pasted it and renamed it into "dark send", as if it was his own creation.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:32:27
I only noticed this deletion because I'm constantly educating people about Bitcoin, and when I can I link to useful articles like the one that was deleted.
Bitcoin is a technological breakthrough and it doesn't make much sense to talk about DAO's history without mentioning it.
And everyone knows and has experienced to different degrees how "guidelines" can be twisted to the point of harrassment and used by the ones in power to push their own agenda. In particular, Wikipedia has a history of *proven* paid shills, even Jimmy Whales talked about the issue.
What exactly makes you think that corporations like Mastercard can spend tons of money hiring lobbyists to fight against digital currencies, but not a few bucks to fight everything related to Bitcoin in places like Wikipedia? The world is not the nice place you seem to believe it is. And because I know that I won't "just relax". "Just relax" is what your masters want you to do... As long as you continue serving them. This has happened multiple times and it will continue to happen. I'll stay alert.

Except I didn't kiss anyone's ass. In fact I openly attacked the one person that kissed Thermos' ass in that thread, and I accused and insulted Thermos multiple times, even in threads that were active that same day. He was obviously not going to review the thread himself, since he's a lazy fuck who couldn't care less about Bitcoin.
I monitored everyone because I didn't want retards like you or dogecoiners to ruin the one chance we had to make this subreddit a better place.
Turns out it was in vane because mods have no power whatsoever, because Thermos basically said that posts that aren't spam are sacred. Chaos makes it easier for him to pull his scams.
So keep calm and troll on.

You definitely have to trust them.
For those saying you also have to trust wallet devs: You could set up a multi-sig address using 3 different wallets, this way no single wallet can screw you.
Someone posted a multi-sig wallet here the other day that allowed you to use third party servers of your choice, so you don't need to trust the creator of the wallet.

Someone should compile a list of altcoins and the reasons why they suck. Eg:
- Nxt: 100% premined and PoS. Read about the "nothing at stake" problem, which renders it worthless.
- Darkcoin: Another Bitcoin clone, ninja-mined, which just added CoinJoin (created by a Bitcoin core dev, for Bitcoin) to the core, but badly implemented, renamed into "dark send" and closed source.
- Peercoin: Same problem as Nxt, but has managed to survive after the attacks by juggling with checkpoints, which is a horrible idea. The coin is under complete control of its dev.

Consider using GreenAddress.it instead, it's much safer because it uses 2-of-2 multi-signature and lets you set limits, and if you use it with a reviewed plugin you can be sure the code won't change one minute to the next and steal your coins when you log in.
@_date: 2014-10-18 17:02:39
Darkcoin doesn't really make sense, it's just a copy of Bitcoin + a bad copy of CoinJoin.
If you are fine with the privacy CoinJoin can give you, just use Bitcoin's Dark Wallet.
If you need more, use Monero (XMR).
There really isn't a use case for Darkcoin, let alone the fact that it was ninja-mined.

The more reason to start banning users instead of removing comments. Again, creating new accounts isn't as easy as you think. Remember creating it is not enough, they also have to pump their karma before they start trolling, or they will hit the time limit for posting every 10 minutes. It could make your life and ours much easier. The amount of energy honest bitcoiners have already spent fighting the trolls is incalculable. Imagine if that energy went to building stuff, educating people, or discussing ideas among us? Imagine if the first few replies that newcomers receive weren't always 100% trolls. You completely underestimate the damage trolls have caused to Bitcoin and continue to cause.

Read what Satoshi said about zero-conf transactions. He said that every second that passed without a confirmation, the more secure the transaction was (because double-spend becomes more difficult), and that it would work just fine for small purchases. He made some calculations I didn't understand at the time and posted them to bitcointalk.

@_date: 2014-06-05 23:46:28


I wouldn't put that on the list. Asking for faster confirmations is like asking for more security (in exchange for nothing). Anyone can have faster confirmations. You could simply edit the code and set the confirmations to 10 seconds. But as anything in engineering this is a tradeoff, you would lose on security so what's the point? Let alone the fact that this is a distributed system, and having confirmations that fast does not scale. I'm pretty sure this is one of those things that people later say "Holy shit, Satoshi really put a lot of thought into this. The value he chose for this parameter turned out to be ideal".
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:41:09
That wasn't decentralized. We were using a centralized forum, and let one person hold the funds. Should have used multi-signature with a trusted  member at least, or move to a decentralized forum.

Or you need to learn more about programming and worry less about syntactic sugar. There is no way you can judge a language without taking into account its ecosystem, unless you are just a "theorist" that never achieves nothing concrete. For example, PHP has the best dependency manager I have seen. It's called Composer, and it blows Bundler out of the water. If you didn't know this, you can't really say you have checked PHP out recently.
PHP is by far the best web platform, whether you like it or not.
I take it you are a Ruby fanboy? Or a C hacker wannabe?
You say now you "know better", but I seriously doubt you know half the things that are taught, for instance, in the Symfony2 docs. It's easily the best web framework at the moment. It's objectively better than Rails and Django. Yes, I used those in case you are wondering. In fact I know their architecture inside out, and I think Symfon2 is much better designed and more useful.
I have no fear of telling others that I like PHP, because I'm not an insecure little kid or amateur dev who needs others' approval. In my professional opinion, PHP is not perfect (has there ever been such a thing? Any programmer worth its salt knows all programming languages suck to some degree), but it's definitely the best tool for the web at the moment.
So, to answer your question: I'm not a "PHP programmer". I'm a programmer.

As much as I like James and his other videos, that video is wrong.
You can't mine a private chain with 51% hashing power without others noticing. And you certainly can't do it indefinitely, which is the only scenario in which you would have a 100% chance of success, which can't happen because of this:
James went as far as prasing PoS, which is known to be broken. So you can't really take him seriously in these matters. He also said "Mt.Gox happened", as evidence that unexpected things happen, which makes no sense since any person knowledgeable in Bitcoin (or with enough common sense) knew that leaving your coins (or money) in an exchange was stupid and was going to eventually end up in a disaster.

I bought at $130. Soon after, the price went down to $100. And then it went down to $60. What did I do? I kept buying like a mofo, because nothing about the potential I saw in Bitcoin had changed. If anything, I was lucky for having the chance to catch that drop.
So how do I feel now about all these swings between $400 and $600?

Well for starters you are attacking Shibecoin for no valid reason whatsoever.
You repeat that it's premined, like dogetards claim. All pure PoS coins have some sort of premine. If you know a better way of distributing the initial coins, I'm all ears. And they definitely did the right thing in adding PoS. Just look at all the angry dogefails calling for a 51% attack. Too bad they simply can't. But rest assured that karma will work, and dogecoin will be attacked by Litecoin ASICs this year.
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:09:40
That proves nothing, no need to be such a liar.
Let's say I start a new subreddit. First of all, the name would suck because anything other than Bitcoin won't be the first thing people new to it try. Second, even though a lot of people are really angry against Theymos (hence the huge number of upvotes I normally get whenever I expose his wrongdoings), how would they find out that I created a new subreddit? I would have to message them one by one. Starting a network effect for the new subreddit would be a huge effort, and ain't nobody got time for that.
Go lick boots some more.
@_date: 2014-06-14 05:41:43
What you are describing is called PoS, and is known to be broken.
For example, the only reason Peercoin is not dead yet is because it's 100% centralized, because it was successfully attacked due to the "nothing at stake" problem and now all of its block have to be signed by its dev.
A secure alternative to PoW hasn't been found yet.


That's wrong, else Bitcoin would be worthless. An alternative word for mining is "accounting", and we will always need that.

More robust? Usually robust means it has less bugs, it's more secure, etc. Turing-complete is the opposite. Add monetary value to that and you have the perfect coctail for a disaster: The incentives to break it will be huge.
 &gt; No one is promising anyone a return on their investment
They are doing exactly that though, with marketing techniques. Eg: calling it Bitcoin 2.0, the future, get in while you can, etc.


It's called evidence. The lack of absolute proof of causation does not imply non-causation.


Counterparty already works. Ethereum is what doesn't work, because doesn't even exist. And Aethereum is just a fairly distributed fork of Ethereum, so it will have the same developments.


I can't bash them all, except by saying that all of them are shit. So I focus on the ones that get most the attention. The only one I like is Monero because it brings true anonymity with the innovation of ring-signatures used for that and is fairly distributed, but I try not to shill too much because people will think I do it for the money.
@_date: 2014-08-23 23:47:26
Some people want to store their wealth for some time (eg: more than 1 year), and see it go up in value.

We are talking about precious metals, not BTC. And no one said BTC is ready for the average Joe, in fact we always say the exact opposite.


There are no inherent fees in Bitcoin, other than the 1-5 cents per onchain transaction. If you have to pay any other fees it's because you are dealing with fiat and its regulation, or private companies that are in their right of charging you whatever they want. You should try trading Bitcoin p2p, because that's what it is. A peer-to-peer currency. And of course there aren't inherent fees in gold trade either.


Again, that's a problem with fiat to Bitcoin, nothing to do with Bitcoin per se, let alone physical gold.


A private company. You realize Bitcoin and gold aren't companies, right?

Don't listen to everyone telling you that "Coinbase is good enough". It's not! With Coinbase you don't even control your own keys. Let's say they decide (or are forced to) shut down the service. Bye bye to your coins. So the second you buy your coins, move it somewhere else where you are in control. Being in control and actually *owning* your coins (as opposed to promises or IOUs) is the whole point of Bitcoin.

Well let me explain then: CoinJoin was created and implemented by core Bitcoin devs like Gregory Maxwell and others. And its whole point is that it doesn't require creating a new coin, it is used on top of Bitcoin. But there you go, some asshole copy/pasted it, renamed it, and claimed it to be something new of this own creation.

But please let us create multiple wallets, like in Armory. I need to have separate wallets, eg: Petty Cash, Business X, Savings, Grandma, etc. 
For example, Electrum is great but it doesn't have that, so I can't really use it. Whenever someone asks for multiple wallets they say "just copy your wallet file, rename it, etc.", which is retarded. It should be integrated in the GUI.
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:17:22
That's all good (except Satoshi said 0 conf transactions were good enough for most cases), but not what you said. You said it wasn't spendable, which is completely false. Oh and look, you said it again!:

We'll see...


I agree with that, and that's why I never wanted dogecoin or any other copycoin to grow. Not because I was "scared" or "angry", as those kids claimed. But because it would hurt the crypto ecosystem, like I said multiple times. This is what a lot of people think and said (I've heard them myself):
- "There were too many coins and I couldn't tell the difference, so I decided to stay away"
- "I already got burned by Feathercoin, I learned the lesson: stay away from cryptocurrencies"
I guess I will soon start hearing the second again, just replace Feathercoin with Dogecoin.

You are confusing (intentionally or not) monetary inflation with the more common price inflation. Bitcoin is deflationary, because prices denominated in Bitcoin go down over time. If you want to talk about monetary inflation you have to be clear about it, because it's less common and less relevant. Most of the time people want to know if their purchasing power goes up or down, not the inner workings of the currency.

Every 10 minutes (it's an average, so it could actually be a few seconds or 1 hour) a block is created and added to the blockchain. This block contains transactions that were waiting for a confirmation, so we say they now have 1 confirmation.


For each block mined, miners receive a reward + fees. The reward was 50 BTC initially, but it halves every 4 years so now it's 25 BTC.


A confirmation could take seconds or an hour. Pulling a double-spend is not easy at all and it's obviously not worth the risk of getting caught if it's a small purchase. There are many merchants here accepting 0 confirmation transactions for their products, and they have never suffered a double-spend.
Satoshi talked about this and said that even without a confirmation, the difficulty goes up every second, and it shouldn't be a problem.
Besides, in the future most people will probably use Bitcoin payment processors.

Sites like Circle might be nice, but remember that the whole point of Bitcoin is that you are in control of your money, not someone else. Circle is kind of like a bank. Using them require that you trust them. Personally I only use such kind of service for buying my coins. For storing them I use my own wallets in cold storage or multi-signature addresses.


Unless you are young and have little money, I wouldn't recommend putting *all* your money into BTC unless you do it for ideological reasons (like hating war, blood-tainted money, etc). The reward / risk ratio is enormous, so it's definitely worth investing in it what you can. But keep some fiat aside just in case.
As an anecdote, I have put *all* my money in BTC last year and it was the best decision ever. But I was already into informatics and cryptography, so I didn't have to take into account the hack risk. Investing in Bitcoin today is much safer though, and the network effect keeps growing stronger.

I usually say that voting is just there to fool people and stop them from revolting. And I agree that laws regarding corporations might be totally unfair and paid. But that doesn't mean we should also throw away the basics that have been studied and improved for years, like laws for murder and that kind of thing. For example, the family of the person murdered is never happy when the accused is released, even if there is little evidence against him and not even them are sure that it was him. But as a civilization we have learned and decided that it's better to let a few murderers go free, than to send innocents to jail. We have also learned that there is little or nothing to be gained and a lot to be lost by punishing or torturing people.

In the sense that CJ was created by Gregory Maxwell (Bitcoin core dev), is well tested, open source, and works. "Darksend" is just a weakened, untested, and closed source CoinJoin. It's just a promise created by a non-cryptographer that fools love to buy.

Millibitcoin and microbitcoin respectively. Some people call microbitcoins "bits". That's fine too. It's like when instead of saying "kilogram" we say "kilo" or whatever is common in your context.


Use whatever you need (so, both). Usually people choose to use the unit that gives them less digits. For example, do you say 1 million USD? Or 1,000,000 USD? Or 100,000,000 cents? All of them are correct, but we normally say 1 million because it's easier in this case. The opposite would happen if you were talking about something that costs $1.5, you would simply say $1.5 and not 0.0000015 millions. And you don't have fanatics trying to convince everyone to "move" to cents. I wish they could figure out that to the other side of the decimal point it's the same thing.

Consider using GreenAddress.it or other multi-signature wallets instead, they are much safer. If your computer is compromised, the minute you log in into your blockchain account the hacker can steal everything. The same can happen if the server is compromised, they could inject malicious javascript and steal from you the next time you log in. With multi-sig wallets, even if someone hacked your PC and your 2FA device, they would only be able to steal the daily (or monthly or whatever) limit you have set.

If that's your reasoning, I'm pretty sure Satoshi covered that ;)


Not necessarily. What I'm actually trusting the most is that if the attacker attempts a double-spend, he won't be able to do it in a safe enough range of time, and he will certainly not be able to do it with a big purchase, as zero-conf transactions are for small purchases only. Let's say he pays for his coffee, leaves the bar, double-spends it, and is lucky enough that he succeeds. The merchant notices, bans him from the bar and next time maybe calls the police or simply kicks his ass. And what did the attacker win? A free coffee. Seriously? This is the big attack everyone is so scared about?

That's some serious bullshit right there. All the software companies rewrite software all the time. Sometimes it's just the best idea. And phpBB certainly took their time to do the rewriting. Or you expect us to keep using the same old forum software for 20 years?
And btw, when I say they rewrote it, it doesn't mean "from scratch". It means that instead of rolling their own basic components like routing, sessions, security, etc., they reused the Symfony2 components which are written by the best in the field. PhpBB is standing on the shoulder of giants now.
Not sure if you were comparing the rewriting of phpBB, or the rewriting by theymos' friend. Sorry if I got the wrong idea.

Wikipedia has a good explanation in my opinion
All that needs to be added when explaining this in a Bitcoin context is that for every Bitcoin address we normally have one key pair, so we can do what that article says.

He's always asking for donations and he never delivers. The 6000 BTC were the coins donated for improving bitcointalk.org. He never used them, the forum got hacked, and today it's still a piece of shit. Then Bitcoin went up to $1000 making the donations worth millions, everyone told him to use a fraction of that for the forum, and the rest for developing all the missing features in Bitcoin, marketing, and other things. He did none of that and said he would still use the coins for what they were meant to be used, because he's such an honorable person. Initially he wanted to maintain the forum himself and pay himself for that. But obviously he can't even update the damned software so it got hacked. So now he says he's gonna pay a software company to build a custom forum. Wtf?!? Here's what he's actually gonna do: deliver a shitty product, and launder all the coins through that "company", probably giving a part to whoever lands the contract (his friends?) and the rest to himself. Oh and he's also charging us a fee just for holding the coins.
Also, remember CoinJoin? That was quite an important development for Bitcoin. Its developers asked us for something like 20 or 30 coins in donations (which of course Theymos didn't want to pay). Who offered himself to hold the coins? That's right! Mother effing Theymos! I just insulted him and never bothered checking again, let alone donate. Not sure what happened next.
So I wouldn't be surprised if the phishing links were added by him, since he bought the wiki from Karpeles.

No, ask anyone who actually has suffered from inflation and see what matters most to them: purchasing power, or the inner workings of the currency?
Bitcoin is not inherently "speculative". It's just behaving like anything with a small market cap. See how penny stocks fluctuate short-term. See how successful startups grew to what they are now: short-term they fluctuate (more wildly at the beginning), long-term they go up.

When you said "ahead of time" I thought you were saying she could prepare her entire chain and then at any point stick it to the honest chain, which of course it wouldn't work.
Your explanation now makes more sense but I'm not sure if I understood correctly:
Alice keeps trying to find a chain longer than the honest one (whenever the honest one becomes too long, she starts trying again but using a younger block from the honest one as starting point), and when she does she spends her coins in the honest one. Then she broadcasts her longer chain in which she didn't spend her coins, so now she has both her coins and whatever she bought with them.
Sounds correct, but for this to work you would have to a) have a lot of mining power, like the top pool and b) find someone who delivers your product instantly (0 confirmation gambling websites would be ideal). Other problems:
- By the time you make it, how many blocks could you have mined honestly? You are risking that money on top of the money you will try to double spend. The plan could fail horribly.
- If this works, confidence in Bitcoin would vanish, rendering all your coins and mining gear worthless
- How do you keep such mining power anonymous? Because if you are not anonymous, you could end up in jail.
I mean, nobody said this wasn't possible, but you need a lot of hashing power. That's why we get scared whenever a pool reaches 51%. But even then, we don't think the double spend would happen, for the mentioned reasons.

Maybe you didn't hear about them because we didn't use them as publicity stunts? I hope you learn about those and change your mind about bitcoin vs dogecoin. Unlike dogecoiners, most bitcoiners are not here to pump, we actually care about the world and humanity. We don't vote brigade your sub, we don't organize pump and dump schemes on IRC, we don't downvote new coins into oblivion in their own new subs. We try to improve the world through technology and education, but unfortunately most of our channels are a constant fight against shitcoin and trolls spam. Haters of all kind and with many different agendas. On top of that, the mods of r/Bitcoin (eg: Theymos) have stolen literally thousands of coins of donations. So we also have to fight against that. Imagine going through all that, and then have to read idiots spamming the entire sub with their tecnically objectivelly worthless pump and dump doge copycoin, and also watching them upvote bad posts to the frontpage and downvote useful posts into oblivion. It's not fun.

If it's for savings, install what you need, update everything, and never connect it to the internet again.
What you do is also have a hot wallet which you refill monthly or whatever, by signing a transaction with your offline machine.
For a very secure hot wallet I recommend GreenAddress.it because it uses 2-of-2 multi-signature and you don't have to think about anything, it's convenient to use and much safer than other options.

BIP70 doesn't seem to have anything to do with the risk of accepting zero-confirmation transactions, and it doesn't remove the need to understand what is Bitcoin and what is a confirmation.
Besides this is a non-issue. We have yet to see a double-spend making a merchant lose more money than credit card chargebacks and fraud. Pulling a double-spend is not as easy as you may think, and is not even profitable nor worth the risk of going to jail (or any other consequence) in most cases.

We need a multi-signature wallet that doesn't require trusting that the code won't be updated automatically and steal our second key (this means no Javascript). It also has to be 2-of-3 because if my computer and 2FA gets compromised, 2-of-2 + nLockTime isn't enough as the hacker will surely be able to move the coins faster than I when the lock expires.
What I propose: a desktop wallet that can create a multi-signature address using three private keys optionally created using dice, and interacts with a third party service of choice to give it one of those keys, set the daily/monthly limits, etc. Ideally there shouldn't be a ton of code because we want other devs to be able to review it and approve it, and not have something like the OpenSSL bug/backdoor go undetected.

No. The network is composed by miners, full nodes, and everyone who uses Bitcoin. The most important thing when making a hard fork, is having the [economic majority](
If the hard fork doesn't change the mining algorithm, you also need more than half of the miners, because else the network will be insecure (angry miners left out might attack it).
But if the hard fork does change the mining algorithm (eg: if we ever decide to move to PoS or change the PoW hashing algorithm), you don't need those miners. The economic majority is enough.

@_date: 2014-06-14 02:10:43
Yes. All that is needed is that the economic majority accepts it, not the hashing power majority. Eg: If developers introduce a change that requires a hard fork, and normal users and full-node operators download the new software, then the hard fork is a success.
Normally you would also need enough miners (not necessarily a majority) to accept it to keep the network secure. But the above proposal doesn't require that because we would be moving from PoW to CPoS.
PoS is known to be broken, but CPoS is still being researched and might end up being a good solution.

It probably simply creates the first few addresses and whenever it sees one of them in the blockchain it creates another one to watch. They are always created in the same order.

That doesn't make sense. Look, digital currencies are **not** new. What's new is the decentralized part. Ripple can win all it wants, but eventually it will either be a) shut down by the government or b) displaced by Bitcoin. Self-interest trumps everything else, and people are not too stupid for this. The only reason they seem to be is because alternative ways of saving and transferring wealth have been a pain in the last centuries. For instance, gold is a pain because it's physical, and it's not even universal because people are banned from trading it in lots of countries (heck, even in the US it was confiscated). Effective ways for storing your wealth have only been available to te rich due to the required time to learn and entrance fees. But Bitcoin is different and it will slowly but steadily become universal knowledge. My father will tell his friend: "Use Bitcoin to preserve your wealth. It can't be stopped." His friend will try, it will work, and he will tell his children and other friends, and so on.

If you are using coinmarketcap.com, notice the asterisk. It means it's not minable, so the price could be anything, really. For instance, imagine if I created a coin but kept 99% of it for myself, put 1% on a exchange and people traded it. Just a few morons buying it could send the price to the moon because of the lack of liquidity, and then coinmarketcap will multiply that price for all (100%) of the coins, giving as result a huge (but false) market cap. With coins that don't have "fair distribution" you can never know what's up. "Fair distribution" for cryptocoins is generally understood as being minable, and at a reasonable rate. For example, if half or all the coins are mined in the first year, it's considered "unfair".

And I can definitely not pay someone's salary. These sorts of developments will have to work the same way Satoshi's development worked so far. Satoshi had no idea if his ideas were going to take off, so he got rewarded big time (though he didn't use the coins at all, but that's a separate issue). You have a lot more certainty, and won't be rewarded as much as Satoshi. But the fact that others will benefit from your work doesn't mean you are working for free.

This is exactly the problem current multi-sig web wallet providers have: You have to trust their software not to steal your key(s). Right now the only way to be safe from this is with GreenAddress and their Chrome plugin, because the plugin won't update automatically like Javascript does. But you have to make sure someone has reviewed the plugin version you will use.
That's why I keep saying that what we need is someone to develop a multi-signature desktop or hardware wallet that can interact with third party web wallets.

Using Bitcoin as an investment and as a store of wealth can make it go a lot higher than what you call "using" it (ie. exchanging it for goods and services). Do you see people using stocks or gold? And yet, those are on the moon because they are scarce and useful as investment and store of wealth.

Because it would change all the time. And anyway you can just say "1 USD in bitcoins".
@_date: 2014-08-13 18:21:25
Not US dollars, but US "official" dollars. That is, the ones that are allegedly sold by the Argentine government. The truth is our government doesn't sell dollars at all in practice. If you go buy to the bank they will tell you need approval from the IRS equivalent (AFIP). If you go to AFIP you will have to go through all kind of bullshit bureaucracy and maybe months later get a denial. If you are lucky maybe they will let you buy $100, and then maybe the bank will not tell you the permission expired.
They are also saying that you could simply use your credit card instead. Well, if you buy anything outside the country with your card, it has a 35% tax, meaning the price will be basically the same as the real price (not the "official" price). That, plus the fact that buying Bitcoin with credit card is hard and expensive, makes their claim dumb.
Some others are indeed saying "I'd rather just use dollars", because they don't know much about Bitcoin. Those are not necessarily shills, you are correct there.

Bytecoin is the original one, but apparently it has been sitting there for years and nobody noticed, and now is almost entirely mined. Some say it was mined in secret. I only heard about it this year when gmaxwell mentioned it on HN. So Monero forked it, announced the launch and made it more fair. I'm normally skeptical of clones, but in this case the devs involved seem really capable, and that partnership with I2P is evidence of it. They seem to fully understand the original project and its code, unlike most altcoin devs.

A multi-signature wallet can be much safer than a hardware wallet. With the hardware wallet you are trusting the manufacturer.
We just need the private keys generation and management to be decoupled from the 3rd party holder of one of the keys. Right now we have some multi-signature wallets like Greenaddress.it, but the problem is that you are trusting their own software not to send them a second key (the one that's on your computer). Sure, you could use the plugin version, review it and never update it. But it would be much better if you could pick a wallet programmed by one entity, and give one of the keys to a separate entity.

Darkcoin is closed source. And it's deceiving because it does not give full anonymity, it gives the same anonymity as Bitcoin + CoinJoin. The difference is with Bitcoin you know for a fact that the coin supply is not being inflated by a bug, a hacker, or on purpose by its devs. And of course hash rate, security, adoption, maturity, dev brain power, etc.

As a long time 100% Bitcoiner, let me tell you that there's some actual innovation going on right now for the first time, it's just a little hard to find. Read about the [cryptonote technology]( which Gmaxwell said is better than CoinJoin. It brings true decentralized anonymization (unlike Darkcoin). Right now lots of [early adopters]( like myself are looking at [Monero]( and seeing value in it. It truly does something Bitcoin can't, thanks to ring signatures.
@_date: 2014-06-14 17:27:09
Just in time to prove my point: some people simply can't math.
This is what happened in your beloved short term: Miners earned say, [+0.16%]( thanks to Ghash... While losing ~15% thanks to the price drop they caused. Smart! And when the media catches up?
And then you also have the idiots who are buying mining contracts at a loss.

We donated 6k BTC over the years to improve the bitcointalk.org forum. Instead of improving it, he kept everything for himself, the forum got hacked and is still shit. When Bitcoin spiked to $1000 and the donations were worth 6 millions, everyone told him to invest that in marketing for Bitcoin, pay more developers to improve the protocol, etc. Instead of that, he said that since he's such a honest person, he was going to use the donations for what their original objective was: the stupid forum. So he was going to hire a software company to develop a custom forum software (reinvent the wheel). Translation: He's gonna launder all that and keep it for himself.
He also owns and bought the Bitcoin wiki straight from Karpeles. Apparently his plan is to control all our communication channels.
Edit: On top of everything, the asshole offered himself to hold the donations for CoinJoin. He could have funded the whole thing with a tiny bit of the donations and not even notice the change.

I just wanted to clarify that the private key is what lets you spend the coins from an address. It doesn't matter if you lose other things like the address or public key (or your whole device), as they can be regenerated if you have the private key.
So let's say you lost your device, but you have your private keys backed up somewhere else. What you do is create a new wallet, import the keys, and move the coins to a different address (especially if the device you lost wasn't encrypted or you didn't have multi-signature - a scheme that requires multiple private keys -, as someone finding it could sweep the keys).

If you are going to use an altcoin for anonymity, at least use something that isn't a copy/paste of Bitcoin. See the cryptonote coins.

That's what we call a practically "premined" coin (dogecoin will mine 100bn this year alone). Good luck with that.
Besides I don't know why you say all coins will be spread out, if dogecoin will have an infinite supply, adding 5.256bn extra coins per year. Might as well just invest in the USD instead.
Also, is gold not a true currency? Because as far as I know, it wasn't quickly distributed. You keep making less and less sense with every comment.

Why do you say Darkcoin is awesome? I disagree, even in theory. One can't simply start coding a cryptocoin and then patch it until it's good. If the original design is not clear it will fail. The whole masternodes thing is a mess, and it compromised the anonymity of the coin. If you want to use CoinJoin (what Darkcoin copied and renamed into "dark send") you can do that with Bitcoin's Dark Wallet which is open source (unlike Darkcoin, which kept the "dark send" part closed source). And if you want even more anonymity go for a Cryptonote-based coin like Monero.

The most likely story is that there was no hack, but no full of evil Karpeles either. The US government stole a lot of money from gox (somewhere between 2 and 6 millions of USD), and that was enough to send it to bankruptcy in my opinion. But because gox had no proof of solvency, they played the banks' game (having less money than they should) and continued operating a few more years. At some point there was a gox run, they didn't have enough coins, and Karpeles decided to file for bankruptcy because there was no way to go on (people understandably lost faith and were going to withdraw everything as soon as they could), and he probably also feared jail as people were getting really angry and serious about it (some people flew to japan and started investigating him, protesting, trying to get the police involved, etc).

Here you have a list of "fairer" "2.0" coins to choose from:
Do you see the problem now?
If Bitcoin can be displaced by a copy of it, then what will stop a second copy from displacing the first one? And so on.
Even if you think Bitcoin's initial distribution isn't fair (what does that even mean? What makes you think you deserve more bitcoins?), that doesn't say anything about the technology. The only way to keep your coins is to never spend them (unlike fiat, there is no bitcoin printing machine that will let the people in power steal wealth from others), so eventually the distribution will be whatever is has to be.

The idea of online wallet + multi-signature is that you are not vulnerable to someone breaking into your house and pointing a gun to your head. That's why I prefer an online wallet that lets you set some limits, like the limits you have in your traditional ATM. But of course with multi-signature, as you don't want them to be able to run with your coins.
Currently I don't trust any online wallet because they all require using their own plugins or javascript. But it would be ok if I could use them with a desktop wallet developed and reviewed separately.

If you bought at $600 and now you are desperate it means you are doing everything wrong, because you were either expecting to see results in less than 1 year, or acting emotionally. You have to have a plan and stick to it to avoid acting emotionally. These fluctuations are normal and happen every year. Just try to accept your "loss" (you aren't losing your house over this, are you?), but don't materialize it. This is how you should treat all your investments, unless the fundamentals change for bad and you find out before others do. Bitcoin's fundamentals haven't changed for bad, in fact it's stronger than ever. You will thank me next year.

You are not supposed to create the receiving address from your offline machine, it's not very convenient. You should create the receiving address in your online machine using your watch-only copy of the wallet.

Welcome to where mods are useless, and rules are to protect trolls. Here's a tl;dr of the rules:
- Don't pester mods
- You are free to troll every single thread.
Protip: Before starting your trolling and also periodically, create a post or comment with lots of upvotes (eg: try quoting Carl Sagan or whatever). This way you can skip the 10 minutes restriction and troll non-stop.
Protip2: If you become a mod and then make it to the top, you will also be able to pull scams like accepting donations and keeping everything for yourself. Once you have enough money you can buy other Bitcoin channels and change all the links for referrals or phishing sites.

A part of the problem is that most bitcoiners keep their coins like they keep cash: hidden somewhere in their homes. So as a good practice they don't go around telling other people "Yeah I totally invested in Bitcoin" or "Yeah I save in Bitcoin".
Maybe if good multi-signature schemes became the norm, bitcoiners would be less afraid of telling others they own bitcoins, and this social proof would make others be less afraid of jumping in.

Yes it's separate. This is a little out of my depth, but I think you first have to choose one interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. For example, in the Many World interpretation, when you observe the particle, you are not sending anything to the other one. You are simply falling into the Universe where the particle you observe has always had spin 0 and the other one 1, or into the Universe where the particle you observe has always had spin 1 and the other one 0.

Bitcoin is not a company that will hear or ignore your complaints.
Bitcoin is a miraculous technology that was gifted to humanity by an anonymous Math samurai.
It's our duty to help spread it and make it grow. Many of us think it's revolutionary, and that it would benefit *everyone* on Earth (minus banksters and other people pulling the strings). You don't seem to share that view, you don't seem to like change. And that's ok. Bitcoin is 100% voluntary.
@_date: 2014-05-13 21:51:12
Well this kind of contradicts the theory that copycoins with a bigger cap were well received because people prefer to have lots of something rather than a fraction of something, hence the success of the bits.

Well whatever you say for fiat it can also be done with Bitcoin. If you believe all the rich people has lots of security and that's the reason they haven't been kidnapped (it's not true, but let's presume it is), then we could do the same if we end up being rich. And cash isn't reversible.
With multi-signature you can tell your web wallet to only allow certain limits. This way if someone wants to take all your savings, he simply can't. He would have to walk with you to the bank safe box or whatever to fetch the third key, or trust that you will come back and not call the police.

If Coinbase shuts down or someone hacks it or your computer and 2FA or someone breaks into your home or the CEO decides to steal everything (like it happened with NEO &amp; BEE), you will lose your coins.
With multi-signature wallets like BitGo or GreenAddress, your coins are much, much safer because moving the coins require multiple private keys. Typically one would be in your computer, another one is given to the web wallet, and optionally a third one in a safe box in your traditional bank or friend's house. You can also set daily/monthly limits to be as safe as you would be with your traditional ATM, this way even if someone has access to your computer and 2FA, they would only be able to steal the daily limit. Should anything else go wrong, you can just take the key on your computer and the one in your safe box and move the coins somewhere else.

Such argument is only made by copycoiners who don't really understand the technology. If you had half a brain you would realize confirmations are for security and have a cost in terms of PoW, and making them faster by changing one line of code is not an improvement. It's just something to impress noobs and take their bitcoins, because it sounds like something had to be re engineered and made more efficient, when in reality it's just messing up with a parameter that Satoshi has put a lot of thought into. You are dealing with cryptography and distributed systems here. Faster doesn't automatically mean better. In fact it can be worse, and it is in this case.

It wasn't a one liner before Wikipedia editors jumped in and destroyed it.
And it cited blogs of people that are very knowledgeable and respected in the Bitcoin world.

I would replace "community" with "economy". One of the reasons dogecoin is soon to die is because scrypt ASICs are coming and dogecoin rewards aren't valuable enough to incentivize miners to keep it safe. The creator of litecoin made some calculations and said dogecoin had to go up at least x4 if they didn't want to get forked into oblivion. And I don't see such rise happening for them.
@_date: 2014-08-23 03:44:44
And how do you know it wasn't Gox or BitcoinBuilder itself upvoting its own posts? The same way Coinbase and many other companies do that shit? That has nothing to do with "this community". That's just how Reddit works, and how you can pay a lot of people or bot owners to rig the voting (and IRL votings can be rigged too. Source: every presidential election ever). The same happened with the doge idiots raiding this sub and placing their news in our front page. And the same is done by you upvote your own intentional misinformation and downvote the well informed responses.

Why would you even mention dogecoin? Do you realize it's the 5th coin, and it will probably get forked into oblivion as soon as scrypt ASICs hit the market, as Charles Lee predicted? Advertising short-lived coins will only hurt the crypto ecosystem. Imagine how would they feel now had you pushed Feathercoin a few months ago, for instance. It was a lot more insteresting than Dogecoin, a lot of people were excited about it, aaaand it's gone! That's what copycoins do, especially those that are not the strongest ones for their hashing algorithm of choice. They simply die for technical and economical reasons, and no "community" or "positive thoughts" can save you from that.

The use of ring signatures to bring true decentralized anonymity.
In case you are interested, here's a summary of [Monero](
- fair launch and distribution
- really strong, multi-disciplinary team
- parnership with [I2P](
- based on the cryptonote technology
- true decentralized anonymity thanks to ring signatures. It's even more anonymous than CoinJoin (and therefore more anonymous than Darkcoin), according to Gregory Maxwell (Bitcoin core dev and creator of CoinJoin)
- very cheap at the moment because it's pretty new
- CPU friendly thanks to Cryptonight algorithm, but can also be mined with GPU (though it doesn't give a huge advantage over CPU)
- lots of Bitcoin early adopters (including myself) like it, because it's the first time we see some actual innovation in the altcoins world
- not a Bitcoin clone, it's a fork of the now dying Bytecoin wich was a complete rewrite and quite innovative unlike most altcoins. Bytecoin failed because it was mined in secret by a few individuals and also its devs left to other projects.

This post made me lol because it's true.
Thankfully, 2014 is the year of multi-signature. People like OP should be using services like [BitGo]( and [GreenAddress]( instead of Coinbase. They are as easy to use but much, much safer.
Coinbase is like a safe box of which you do not own the key. You have to ask its guardian to open it for you every time.
BitGo etc. are like a safe box of which you own 2 keys, and its guardian owns a third one, and only 2 keys are needed to open it. You also tell the guardian how much money he must let you withdraw daily/monthly (think of the limits you have in a traditional ATM). So normally when you want to spend, you use one of your keys and the guardian checks the limits and uses the second key. Note that all this happens automatically and you use it the same way you would use Coinbase. If something ever happens to BitGo, you simply fetch your third key from the safe place where you stored it (be it a safe box in your traditional bank, or a submarine vault :p), and move your coins somewhere else.

I'm not sure I understood 100%.
With a subreddit, there are things you can't do even as its creator. Ok. But I don't think you need permission to do anything normal from the global reddit admins or sysadmins, and they usually don't interfere. I mean if they interfered shouldn't they have removed the fraudster Theymos already?
And a separate website would cost money that I'm not sure how we could go about for collecting it. Imagine when we get spikes of visitors, a cheap server wouldn't survive. Reddit is a write-heavy site.
I like the idea, but I'm not sure I want to do it as a first step. Many people have created spaces for bitcoiners, but they weren't well received and stayed underpopulated. Unless you don't care about that bit, and just want to get the news free of trolls?
A subreddit on the other hand, would only cost hosting a bot to repost stuff from other bots to promote it, etc., and could easily grab traffic from other subs.

Just buy some Monero, send it to him, and then he can sell it for Bitcoin. Monero has true decentralized anonymity.
Or you can try Bitcoin's Dark Wallet, but some people have lost coins in the past because it was alpha and it still is I think, and it doesn't give as much privacy as Monero.

A true currency has a distribution phase. Dogecoin will stay not distributed and worthless.
Besides, you can create convenient theories all you want, just like those angry and old economists. But that won't stop dogecoin from dying.

It was a 0-conf double-spend, anyone could have done it (including the rogue employee they said it was), and it was only possible because there was someone, the bet site, willing to irreversible send a lot of wealth in exchange for 0-conf transactions, which is stupid.

There seems to be some sort of brainwashing going on there. I have an internet friend from Venezuela and he liked Chavez (I guess he likes Maduro too). I asked him about the crazy shit that happened every day there, and he denied everything, he said it was all lies from the media. But the other day we were playing an online game with him and some of his IRL friends, and one of them went offline and another one said there was a shooting, and that different factions (pro/anti government) were having a fight. His friend was wounded, his other friends were raging against the government, and he still says it's not common, and that it's not the government's fault. I have seen this denial in Argentina too. I don't know what leads people to that.

They just have to exaggerate their spendings like any other company, or make a lot of their money disappear in a catastrophe. So if the company has lots of bitcoins (which is the case of exchanges right now, not normal companies), and they can get away with claiming they were hacked, they can send that money anywhere easily. In the future I expect that the shareholders (or regulators) demand that the companies use some sort of multi-signature scheme, instead of a CEO has all the power scheme.

Bitcoins already grow in value by themselves, and there is no easy way to "double" your bitcoins. What you can do is work for bitcoins (or for fiat and then buy bitcoins with it) like everyone else here.

Read about the "nothing at stake" problem, instead of funding fads and shills just because you are scared.
Also, if Bitcoin dies rest assured that all the cryptocurrencies will be buried for at least a hundred years, so you didn't really diversify at all. Confidence won't come back in our lifetimes.

They don't need to infect you with malware, you are already using their software. For example, if you use BitGo or GreenAddress with Javascript, they can change the code any time and steal your key from your localStorage.

Except it's not really anonymous, as it's simply CoinJoin and has the same problems.
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:08:39
The amounts are lower than the fee you would have to pay, so it's pointless anyway if you use a regular wallet. One way to get around this is by handcrafting a transaction to include them all but also include a big and old input. I don't remember the details but I did something like that for my brainwallet bots.
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:46:31
It doesn't mean to the moon, and it doesn't mean to the ground. It's just more acceptance, legitimacy, etc.
Most bitcoiners are not desperately trying to find places to sell their coins, so adding another place where you can trade your coins for something else changes nothing in this regard. If the people now buying stuff from Microsoft with their bitcoins wanted to get rid of their coins, they could have done so in an exchange or localbitcoins.
Most of us don't buy a bunch of bitcoins and then spend them all like consumerists. We buy, save, and then whenever we spend, we refill our stash. Some even do that automatically, with features like Coinbase's auto rebuy.
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:12:01

Why do you need to move all your savings all day long?
The normal thing to do is have one offline wallet for savings, and one online wallet for small/medium purchases. From time to time (eg: weekly or monthly) you refill the online wallet by signing a transaction with your offline wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:00:56


No, miners can't change the protocol because full nodes would refuse to propagate their blocks. They would have to collude with the developers and make everyone update their software. Don't get mad but it's right there in the wiki, which makes me think you didn't read it.
I admit there is a problem with the lack of incentives for running full nodes though. But I'm sure these things will get sorted out in time. People are acting like Bitcoin was already running the entire world's economy. We are still allowed to make a few mistakes, be attacked, and then recover. The blockchain won't disappear.

That's all good, the problem is dogecoin isn't even alone for its hashing algorithm (scrypt). It's all fun and games until the value of the reward drops and hashing power begins to leave, and the 51% attacks begin. That's what happened to Feathercoin.

To be honest I don't mind pumps when a coin is actually innovative. And as a Bitcoin early adopter and evangelist, this is the first time I'm excited about an altcoin.

Normally you wouldn't be able to buy 30,000 coins without moving the price up in the process, costing you a lot more. That's why such auction was a great deal for big investors, even if they bought at 600 or even more. So yeah, even if the price of the winner was 600, the price will go up now. And like others mentioned, you also have the other buyers that still want lots of coins.

Keep in mind that dogecoin is just a copy/paste of Bitcoin's reference client. Whatever you can do in dogecoin you can do it better in Bitcoin and a lot more.
For instance, the best idea for cold storage is using a deterministic wallet like Electrum or Armory, which you only have to back up once. Optionally you can also have an offline machine to use as your personal ATM, you simply create a transaction into a USB pendrive using your online machine, then sign it with the offline machine, and then broadcast it with your online machine.
We also have multi-signature web wallets like BitGo and GreenAddress, which are much safer than normal web wallets.

Gregory Maxwell said ring signatures are being used in a very smart way and that they give more privacy than CoinJoin.
I'm sorry that his (or my) opinion on this is not convenient for your pump, Darkcoiner.
Besides, are you seriously recommending us to use a closed source coin? Because last time I checked, the CoinJoin part of Darkcoin was closed source, and all you have are promises for open sourcing it. Promises, that's the only thing most altcoins bring. Also, why use an altcoin if all you added to it is CoinJoin? CoinJoin was created for Bitcoin and works just fine. In fact, Darkcoin fucked up with the whole masternodes mess. Bitcoin's DarkWallet is much better.


Satoshi didn't solve that "issue" either, he simply waited for Moore's Law to do its magic. Cryptonote coins will have a good enough margin of operation in my opinion, the blockchain bloat is not an issue at all right now, and it won't be in the future either.
Edit: Wow, just wow. Ndsnt0 edited many of his comments to remove his praising of Darkcoin, and now he says he owns Monero, to make it look as if he's not biased in his opinion.

@_date: 2014-12-12 20:10:23
You also seem confused about the ad hominem fallacy. A personal attack is only an ad hominem if it is *not relevant*. For example, if I say "this guy likes to suck dicks, I have him on tape", it's irrelevant. But if I say "this guy's entire comment history follows the reddit concern troll pattern" (ie. grind karma, then go on full negativity mode to attack Bitcoin 24/7/365, showing he has as much time for spreading negativity as normal people have for their own jobs), it's very much relevant to what we are discussing here and it's perfectly fine to point it out.
A concern troll is someone who shows himself as a supporter, but he just has certain "concerns". And then proceeds to enumerate problems he "noticed". Those problems are usually things that were already known, solved, or irrelevant, but make the attacked thing look bad. Some of those problems are usually hard to explain (eg: something technical, scary-sounding but that in reality isn't inherently bad, like for example "hard fork"). This way, with simple innocent looking sentences and little effort, they either scare newbies away, or they draw tons of energy from actual supporters who waste their time refuting those attacks.
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:33:33
Interesting, but he says he installs Armory and imports the backups every time. And even if TAILS is quite safe, an air-gapped machine will be better. Also what if someone gains access to his USB sticks? They could modify the contents in little time. A whole machine would at least delay the evil maid much more. This is not very convenient nor the safest of the options IMO.

@_date: 2014-06-05 11:28:57
Yes, but if you pay 0 fees you will have to wait for the transaction to make it into the blockchain because the priority of the transactions depends on a formula that includes among other things the age of the coins multiplied by the amount, and the age of the coins you just sent will be 0. That's why handcrafting the transaction would be better: you could use very old coins in the same transaction and increase its priority.

That's what I want to ask them: With all the good things happening to Bitcoin, why do they feel the need to shit all over our accomplishments? Why do they feel the need to make every merchant that accepts Bitcoin, instantly regret his decision due to their fucking doge spam? Why can't they accept the fact that copy/pasting won't create value and make them rich? Why can't they help us make the world a better place instead of hindering our efforts for a little (and only potential/imaginary) personal gain? They could benefit much more by joining our moon rocket.

I'm not saying it will have "some uses" in underground markets. I'm saying it will not only survive, but it will be even more expensive if it's banned, the same way marijuana (and weapons, and gold, and foreign currencies) is more expensive in places where it's banned. And nobody gives a damn about regulation, people rarely stop doing things they like for fear to jail, especially if they feel like it's their natural right.

You are missing that what you said would only be true if those coins had the same hashing power. So if their coin has 1 minute confirmation times (eg: doge), 10 confirmations will give them *much, much less* security than 1 Bitcoin confirmation.

In fact Bitcoin has donated *literally* millions of dollars, while dogecoin has wasted more in explicit publicity like the nascar stuff than in humanitarian things.

You even went as far as saying ring signatures as used in Cryptonote are not a technological achievement, just because people knowing about them would not be convenient for your little shitcoin.

What I didn't catch is why do you care about what I do with my coins. I want to use them as an investment and as a store of value, and you will benefit from that like it or not. There seems to be this weird belief that if people hold, the coin will die for no reason. It became part of the altcoin narrative cycle when dogecoiners started using that argument to promote their inflationary copycoin.

Nobody has a "limited understanding" of Ethereum's goals, that's just something Ethereum fans (or anyone who has just learned about Turing-completeness and is having a false sense of being smart) love to repeat.
Seems like the very first thing every altcoin develops is an elevator pitch for why bitcoiners don't understand and hate this particular altcoin. The truth is we understand them just fine, and they are still scams.
If you truly like the idea of smart contracts, you can always go with Aethereum (the non-scam version of Ethereum), or Counterparty.

It's quite the opposite of everything GNULinuxGuy said.
Darkcoin is vaporware. It's closed source. It's a flawed version of CoinJoin (the whole masternodes thing is nonsense that has actually weakened their CoinJoin, one guy posted how to deanonymize it on bitcointalk), so Bitcoin + CoinJoin is much better, which makes Darkcoin completely redundant. On top of that it has been instamined due to a bug that they purposely allowed (a common scam in the cryptocoins world).
The creator of Darkcoin at one point said he would add ring signatures to Darkcoin, because it was obvious that cryptonote coins offered much more privacy. But then he backed off because he found out he was out of his depth (he's not even a cryptographer).
Most of Darkcoin's strategy and resources are basically the same as Dogecoin: Spam that shit everywhere, lie every chance you have, try to discredit your competition without real arguments, etc.

"Mil" means "a thousand" in Spanish, so I guess that's where it comes from (or Latin maybe). So it's a thousandth. And a microbitcoin (or bit) is a millionth (which you get by dividing again by 1,000). There's also the word "millenium" in English which means a thousand years, so maybe you can use that as a mental anchor.
I know it's hard for Americans and Indians since most of them never used the metric system. For the rest of us this is basic school stuff.

Yeah doge remains stable after losing more than 3/4 of its value in USD over the last months (went down from 250 satoshi to 100... now 80, at the same time that BTC went down 50% in USD). This is actually good news, doge style!

That everyone can become wealthier, because wealth is created all the time. That's the opposite of a zero-sum game, where the sum of the wins and losses is always zero, meaning you can only win if someone else loses. Bitcoin makes it possible for everyone to win because it has a fixed maximum supply (21 millions), as opposed to fiat currencies where the government can increase the supply indefinitely. In an economy that is growing, if the currency (eg: the USD) maintains always the same price (or lower), it means the government is stealing all the growth through the invisible tax of inflation. In a Bitcoin economy, you can become wealthier over time just by keeping your savings in Bitcoin, without needing someone else to lose anything.

It's still a scam. It's pure marketing, like dogecoin and similar coins that offer no technical improvements over Bitcoin. But at least those others are open source! In the past months, Darkcoin devs have been trying to fight Monero because they see it as a huge threat, because it actually offers something interesting: true decentralized anonymity thanks to ring signatures, without the masternodes nonsense, and even more privacy than CoinJoin (the creator of CoinJoin said that about ring signatures). At some point the founder of Darkcoin said he was going to add ring signatures, but then he backed off because he realized he was out of his depth (he's not a cryptographer) and used a lame excuse. It has also been instamined due to a bug they decided to keep. Literally everything about this coin screams "scam". If it's still in the top 10 it's because most of the other coins suck too, so the whole thing is basically just a marketing war between scamcoins. If you have money in altcoins my advice is to sell for bitcoins. But if you still want to gamble, I'd recommend Monero and maybe Counterparty.

So how would you have said it?
@_date: 2014-06-14 12:28:11
1) Anyone can try to double-spend zero-confirmation transactions. But a pool with a lot of hashing power can try to double-spend confirmed transactions.
2) Double-spend is spending the same coins twice, but only one of the payees will receive them (usually the same person doing the double-spend). So you could say there's actually no such thing as a double-spend, just someone being fooled thanks to a trickery with forks or transaction priorities.
3) Double-spends happened tons of times, but mostly with zero-confirmation transactions. And double-spend attempts happen all the time, they are a normal thing just like short-lived forks.
4) Not at all. The blockchain won't magically disappear one moment to the next. In the event of an attack, the network will adapt, and then recover and go back to normal. There are many ways to stop an attack, including changing the protocol, and have it accepted by the [economic majority]( For example, one of the reasons BitFury says they will move hashing power away from Ghash, is because they are afraid that we might decide to make a change to the protocol that would render the ASIC miners they own and produce useless, effectively destroying their business.
Some things you should definitely read if you haven't already:

I still have no clue why people pay for private repositories in github: Bitbucket.org
@_date: 2014-06-13 09:59:29
People are losing their minds over nothing. There's nothing special about going above 50%, since the same attacks are also possible below 50%. They say above 50% it's a 100% success rate, but that's a vague statement because it depends on time. It tends to 100% the longer you perform the attack. But attacks can't run indefinitely, because they are noticed and measures can be taken.
So yes, someone controlling a lot of hashing power is bad. That doesn't mean that when they go from 49% to 51% Bitcoin is automatically dead and you have to lose your mind. Even if the owner of that hashrate decides to attack Bitcoin, the blockchain won't magically disappear. The protocol can adapt, and the network can recover.
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:32:30

Inflation is not a force of nature, it's caused by governments on purpose when they print money, effectively stealing mostly from the savers. It's basically an invisible tax that won't cause people to riot when raised. The only people that can escape from this are rich people, who have the time to learn how to invest, the money to pay entrance fees, and the connections and information not to make mistakes. It also favors consumerism, spending on things we don't need, and damaging the Earth, as opposed to saving for harsher times, responsible spending, and sustainable development.
A deflationary currency will benefit the poor, as they will finally have an easy way to save/invest and also get a cut of the global economic growth, instead of letting bankers and governments take all of it (and even more) for themselves.

As with any investment, you have to watch its fundamentals to predict its price long term. Bitcoin's fundamentals are stronger than ever, so rest assured that long term it's going up.
If you are asking what happens short term (like, next month), nobody knows. Like I mentioned it includes factors like random people panicking, which can be expected but never predicted with much accuracy. For instance, when I saw the sell wall I knew there would be panick, but I wouldn't try to predict a price, just that it would go lower than it was at that point.
I always take these chances to buy some more, and I don't worry if it continues dropping after that. I know next year or the year after that it will be way up.

That's kind of what I meant by "Each man is supposed to make his own way". A great man wouldn't follow those rules strictly, he would simply learn about how things work and then do whatever he wants.
I still believe what I said, read it again: "If you want to 'close the deal' **with that kind of girl**, that's the way to do it". The girl was clearly a cunt, be it 100% by her own choice or natural sociopathic traits, or because society turned her into that; doesn't matter. If you then want to go deeper and really get to know her and her to know you, it's all good and she might turn out to be a great girl. But that's way beyond the scope of seduction, and comes after seduction (not before).
TheRedPill can be a little harsh toward women, but that's just to balance things a little bit. After all, a lot of men are tired of not being treated like equals. For instance, I would love to be able to say "hi" to little kids or tell parents how cute their kids are, but I can't. I know they are going to look me bad or call the police. Oh but if a woman does that it's all good! Women never rape kids! Amirite? The same happens with many other things.


It makes it ok because it was completely consensual. The girl loved it. I pointed out that it was the only way because I assumed we understood the girl wanted to have sex, it's just that she's so complicated that no ways that are intuitive for the modern man will work.

No it won't. The second GHash breaks the Satoshi Social Contract, the network (which is also made of people) will react and either stop them or leave them out (there are multiple measures that can be taken in such an event, that's why core devs are not worried).

Which is exactly what we want? Stopping spam and trolling are noble goals. There's a reason Bitcoin has anti-spam/DOS measures: there will always be people wanting to bring destruction (even when they have nothing to gain from it). But there are no measures in there is no limit of accounts or comments for a troll, and that's disrupting our discussion.

Just because his analogy isn't good, doesn't mean the reverse is correct. Bitcoin is definitely not to the blockchain what HTML is to the internet. HTML doesn't secure the internet. In fact it's not required at all. Bitcoin on the other hand is used to pay the miners to keep the blockchain secure, which keeps Bitcoin secure and gives it value. You can't really separate them.

As far as I understand, one of the problems with p2pool is that it's a chicken an egg situation: High variance keeps miners away, which keeps variance high.

Yes that is a lot more informative. But the landing page has to contain almost no other information. I'm no expert, but I think having a sidebar to the left (or at all), plus a closeable message with a long sentence to the top (the one that says  "Are you an user on reddit? The community is passing the torch. Visit your money for a 1-click upgrade to ChangeTip"), etc. is annoying and distracting. And the important text is really small. In my opinion, this particular page shouldn't have any sidebars, and what I'm supposed to read should be a lot bigger and clearer. The screenshots of reddit comments kind of blend with the page so at first sight one can't tell where their boundaries are (am I reading a screenshot or the website?). To sum up, my experience was that the first times the website made me feel tired so I just closed it. Only now that I'm more interested (and indirectly invested) in it I forced myself to read that page.

Maybe because Darkcoin is just Bitcoin with CoinJoin (which was developed for Bitcoin and works just fine)?

It is what you asked. They organize voting brigades to downvote and report any bad news and upvote any good news for them in many subreddits including this one. They have even threatened several redditors. They also claim the coin to be as secure as Bitcoin, which is absolutely false; it is waaay less secure than Bitcoin. And you can already see the effects of this: ask any dogecoiner about it. Odds are they will say dogecoin is just as secure as Bitcoin, or even more. They have no clue what they are doing, most of them are 15 years old or just ignorant, both financially and technically. Some of them truly believe the coin is made of positive thoughts. Some others understand exactly what they are doing: fooing people like you and taking advantage.

I just disagree that reddit is such a good source though. I and many others have had the experience that while you are learning something that is not your speciality, reddit seems great. But then when they are discussing something you are a specialist in, you realize it might not be that great after all because most often than not the top comment is pure crap, full with bad info, citations and everything. And if you try to argue with him, the downvotes will kill you, and only other specialists like you will be able to appreciate that you are right, sometimes via PM. Only after a long thread, introducing the person to subjects he didn't even know they existed, he might admit he was wrong (sometimes not even that), but of course nobody will read that far. There's too many people wanting to look good in front of random anonymous users.

Oh god, can you guys stop going full retard?
Anyone, literally anyone can make blockchain.info show that message.
Example: Remember when people were losing money to brain wallets, because hackers were "mining" them? Whenever someone sends money to one of those broken brain wallets, all the brain wallet "miners" will try to spend it at the same time. That's not what one would normally call a "successful" double-spend.
Just because you are scared of Ghash, it doesn't mean you have to post every 0-conf double-spend attempt you find. Those are literally all over the place, and happened every day for years.

I know monetary inflation is not the same as price inflation, that doesn't change anything. Gold goes up in market value over time, therefore it's deflationary. No, I don't mean "in dollars".

51% attacks can't steal coins, just double-spend. And Peercoin has in fact already been successfully attacked this way, that's why the coin is 100% centralized and every block has to be signed by its dev, else the attacks would come back.

Normally you would also have a weekly and/or monthly limit (not sure if GreenAddress lets you have multiple limits), so that even if you are AFK for a few days and get hacked you wouldn't lose everything. It would work the same way your ATM works: you can't lose everything in a day or a few days.

For instance, have you seen what's the justification that everyone (intelligence agencies, the military, the president, etc.) use whenever they want to violate people's rights (spying, kidnapping, torture, bombings)? "National security!", "to protect American citizens!", etc.
Now they are stepping on American citizens' rights, and you guys are like "Wait there is a big difference right there". Really? Well, too bad, because now you won't be able to stop them.

Merchants are just like normal users. Under the event of an attack, they will obviously follow the devs, not the attacker.


Yes it's dangerous, but not the end of the world or Bitcoin, even if they decide to attack it.
In addition to the wiki link, see this article by Gavin (core dev):
There was also a video by James D'Angelo being passed around, which had a few misunderstandings that ended up confusing and scaring a lot of people. If you see it, then know that there is nothing special in going from 49% to 51%: When someone says that 51% gives you 100% of chance of success in your attacks, they are omitting the part where that's only valid on an infinite timescale (they also omitted it in the wiki unfortunately), and besides you can't mine a private chain with 51% without others noticing, because we would see a huge drop in the hashing rate of the network, and measures could be taken. Also, see the 13 rule of the protocol:
So, if we are under attack, just wait for more confirmations for any significant payment you receive.

Actually, most countries won't send you to jail for failing to provide a key. It's mostly a US and UK thing, and it's not even that old. In fact, in many countries the law explicitly says you can't be forced to testify against yourself.

But by your logic, you must not ban me because freedom, am I right? Because if you ban someone for saying TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL, then you might also go full retard and ban someone who has added a lot of value to the discussion, and contributed a lot to Bitcoin over the years, right?

Being "under active development" and "changing the protocol all the time" aren't the same thing, and obviously the latter isn't desirable at all, especially when the reason behind those changes is that the underlying design was never secure to begin with.

You should check Mullvad if you haven't already, as it would be your competition.
- no personal data asked, not even an email
- 3 hours free for new accounts. It's helpful when month or year of service ends and you need to renew it, as one would obviously prefer to do that over a normal connection
- lots of options, including OpenVPN which is a must
- they actually know how to encrypt a damned email with PGP, in case you need support. Most other companies will just make you talk with some lvl 1 support retard who will expose all your data in the very first email
- Not US based

But in the US, on top of that you also have to pay a lot more as punishment. I'm not sure if there are many countries that do this.

Why not? Do you hate thinking?
Whatever happened with gold in the past that kickstarted its use as a currency, is a thing of the past. Once there is consensus on its utility as a store of wealth, there's no need for the initial utility it had to give it value.
In fact, there are probably lots of things that gold could be used for, but does not make sense economically anymore (or ever, if it's a new use) because it's too freaking expensive because it's much more useful as a store of value now.

Every time I hear someone saying the good things about dogecoin, they are actually saying just the good things about a subreddit or about the Bitcoin technology. Many other subreddits also see themselves as communities, and they also have the power of collecting money (through Bitcoin or traditional methods). Besides, in the end, every individual will do what's in his own best interest (you can't change that by being nice nor by attaching a cute dog picture to everything), and that works just fine for Bitcoin because it has the right incentives, as it was carefully designed by Satoshi. This dogecoin "community" I keep hearing about is just marketing, a facade, an empty shell. Just the other day I went to to see what was going on and the first thing I read was the experience of one merchant that wanted to sell T-shirts. His conclusion: The average dogecoiner doesn't even own enough doge to buy a T-shirt, which sounds about right because those publicity stunts you mentioned were paid almost entirely by a single dogecoiner.
Dogecoin is redundant.

One interesting use could be insurance.
gave an example the other day (let's see if I understood it correctly): Imagine something bad can happen in a special day like rain in your wedding, and the weather cast says it's very unlikely to happen (but still possible). Then you could bet a small amount to "it will rain" as insurance. If it rains you make back the money of moving the wedding to another day. If it doesn't, no problem, it was a small amount for peace of mind. Other people who want easy money will bet to "it won't rain", and take what you paid.

Of course that if the mod is good, the mod is good. That's kind of a tautology. But I doubt the mod can be good if he's invested in copycoins. Are you willing to remove anything not related to Bitcoin (eg: dogecoin/litecoin good news), as you are supposed to according to the rules of this sub?
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:03:12
Litecoin and dogecoin are basically copy/pastes of Bitcoin's code with some slight and dumb changes in the parameters or in the branding (eg: a different logo). Let me explain with images:
We call those types of coins clonecoins or copycoins. They are tipically created with no other purpose than taking bitcoins from the fools. There are today hundreds of copycoins, but all of their market capitalizations combined are less than 10% of Bitcoin's market capitalization, and are accepted nowhere.

A summary of Monero, in case anyone is interested in knowing more:
- fair launch and distribution
- really strong, multi-disciplinary team
- parnership with I2P
- based on the cryptonote technology
- true decentralized anonymity thanks to ring signatures. It's even more anonymous than CoinJoin (and therefore more anonymous than Darkcoin), according to Gregory Maxwell (Bitcoin core dev and creator of CoinJoin)
- very cheap at the moment because it's pretty new
- CPU friendly thanks to Cryptonight algorithm, but can also be mined with GPU (though it doesn't give a huge advantage over CPU)
- lots of Bitcoin early adopters (including myself) like it, because it's the first time we see some actual innovation in the altcoins world
- not a Bitcoin clone, it's a fork of the now dying Bytecoin wich was a complete rewrite and quite innovative unlike most altcoins. Bytecoin failed because it was mined in secret by a few individuals and also its devs left to other projects.

A lot of people got burned by doge and many other copycoins, when they could have simply invested in the more mature and stable Bitcoin. Some of them did it out of greed, but many others did it because they didn't know the difference. And you know how shibes are not precisely the most honest people on Earth when they do their marketing. And some other people didn't even know Bitcoin existed and that dogecoin just copied it. Another example: The other day there was a guy here claiming dogecoin was just as secure as Bitcoin, which is completely false, and there was no way to make him understand. I couldn't even tell whether he was outright lying or trolling us or was another victim of the doge misinformation.

b) There is no way for a normal person to secure his/her coins. That's why I think we need a desktop wallet that:
- lets you generate keys for a multi-signature 2-of-3 address, using dice, from more than one device (at least one has to be offline, so that your offline key never touches your online machine, and the key handled to a third party service only touches it encrypted)
- lets you connect to third party (not related to the coders of the wallet) services of your choice to hold one of the keys and set the daily/weekly/monthly limits
- doesn't have too many lines of code and is written in a popular language, so that it can be easily reviewed and approved by peers
Once we have this, we can recommend Bitcoin to the average Joe Redneck as a secure way to store his savings.

Bitcoin can be seen as an investment, the same way gold is. Some people say you shouldn't see it that way, because they have been conditioned to think that money = government issued paper currency. The truth is gold has been money for thousands of years, while paper currency has only existed for a hundred or so years.
Bitcoin, on top of having all the good money properties of gold (like scarcity, fungibility, etc), it has all the good properties of being digital: it can be easily transported, verified, stored, divided, etc. Adding such properties doesn't subtract anything from its ability to store value.
People who say it should only be used as a payment system, usually agree with everything the Keynesian school of Economics say. That school of thought is just what bankers and other people in power want you to think, because they benefit from the invisible tax called inflation. There's a reason previous attempts at creating non-government money were shut down with violence: The government doesn't want competition. Examples: e-gold and Liberty Reserve. Both were closed under bogus charges of "facilitating child pornography", "money laundering", etc., and their creators and administrators imprisoned. Bitcoin, having no central authority administrating it, can't be shut down in the same way.

When BTC spiked to like $1,000, everyone told him to use a little bit of the coins for the forum, and the rest for marketing campaigns, paying the developers of important things like CoinJoin, and other great ideas. He replied that since he was such an honest person he was going to use the coins for what they were donated: improving the forum. So he was going to hire a software development firm to build his own forum software (reinvent the wheel). Translation: He's going to launder all the money through a friend's company and keep most of it for himself.
On top of that he keeps showing up every time people need to gather money. For example, when we needed to gather money for CoinJoin, the asshole offered himself to hold it.

I don't have more money, I have more wealth (I have the same coins, but they are more valuable now). That kind of wealth transfer is normal when the world shifts from one dominant reserve currency to the next one. But people jumping in are not losing any wealth because of the act of buying. Whatever wealth they lose (if any), they have already lost it as the (soon to be former) dominant reserve currency went down in value.

Are you aware that bankerfrombtc is a well known troll and fudster in this subreddit? Literally all of his comments are like that, and he is growing stronger than ever thanks to your and everyone else's recent fear.
Ghash can't change the protocol because they don't have control over full nodes, and neither have they control over the developers.
A hard fork for a normal user looks like this: Devs announce the hard fork and a limit date to download the new wallets. Normal users, miners, and full node operators "vote" by downloading the new software or by continuing to run the old software. Devs then announce that everything is ok now, or that the change has been rejected and will have to come up with new ideas until consensus is reached.

If a copycoin replaces Bitcoin just by changing its name or adding a silly picture, what's to stop another one to replace that one as well? And why would anyone trust in cryptocurrencies then?
Bitcoin has more hashing power (which makes it more secure), more and smarter developers, more user adoption, more infrastructure, more everything than all the altcoins combined. There's no good reason to deal in altcoins. Most of them were created just to take some bitcoins from the fools, and the rest are just a testing ground for features that will eventually be added to Bitcoin, be it in the main chain or as a sidechain.

I still don't know what application you are using so I don't know the specifics of your case.
Whatever you are using, if you backed up the private keys that's enough. Public keys are not needed. If you are using a non-deterministic wallet, the backup is just a list of private keys. Sometimes they also add the addresses for convenience, but they are not needed.
If you use Armory you can see the individual keys if you want to. You just click on a wallet, then on an address, and then 'view address keys'.
To learn, you can start playing with addresses and keys using blockchain.info, no need to install anything.

Isn't about time people learn what inflation and deflation are? When money is not run by "magicians" anymore, and the monetary inflation becomes transparent thanks to the public ledger, the price inflation/deflation real rates and causes will be more transparent too.
For example, I was never happy to see my salary increased if that increase was lower than the price inflation.
This is not advanced cryptography. This is something very basic we can expect everyone to learn in a better future where kids are actually taught in school all the things they should know so that they don't get scammed by their own government or anyone else when they get out of it.
