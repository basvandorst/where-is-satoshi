Argue with someone who actually matters. How about you start with Luke-jr? He seems to think we don't have enough full nodes.

You confuse me. Are we complaining in this thread about the lack of people running full nodes or are we not?

Haha no kidding. Incentives are supposed to motivate actors to do something. Since hardly anyone runs a full node, clearly the incentives are not very enticing. That is the free market in action. The cost of running a full node is greater than the benefit for most people. So you can either reduce the cost or increase the benefit if you want people to change their behavior. Neither option is practical without fundamentally changing the protocol. And economically speaking, reducing costs by lowering the block size cap not only has zero effect on getting actors to change their behavior, but it also has severe negative consequences.
The real solution is to either accept Bitcoin's design and how it plays out in real life (it's inevitable there will be fewer full nodes and fewer individual miners as time goes on) or switch to an altcoin that incentivizes full nodes with an actual monetary reward.
Money talks. Money motivates. You'd think people would understand this by now. Yet here we are, with people in this community baffled by the dwindling node count, completely misdiagnosing the problem.

Requiring a vote with 95% agreement sure does give a lot of veto power to a tiny minority. Imagine if Congress required 95% of the vote be able to pass anything. Absolutely nothing would get done. Because fringe minorities would have all the power to block any and everything.

Nice retort. Refute a baseless claim with another baseless claim!
