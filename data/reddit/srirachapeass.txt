gawd damn. Crypto twitter keeps luring in these noob traders/gamblers.  Crypto twitter influencers  is the king of scamming. Why do they have to post tweets about them buying certain bags which makes people FOMO into their bags which causes pump in this low liquidity market. Keep it to yourself. Stop telling people what ure buying and dumping on them. Fuck I hate crypto twitter .

I don't have a fundamental explanation but I have technical explanation: 
my comment is not a financial advise :X
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:03:40
to be honest, anything is overpriced or underprice.  i dont believe in overprice/underprice. price is at that price for a reason(supply/demand).
berskhire($brk.a) owned by warren buffet is $250,000 per share. thats fucking nuts. who the fuck buys that? rich people( i would too if i was rich) EDIT: speaking off, I just check berkshire price and its now at $280,000 from last time i checked last month.($30k increase)
bitcoin can reach $10,000, $100,000, $250,000 and rich people and institutions will take over it and retailer will fall off.
thats why altcoins exist, for the people who missed the btc ride.
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:50:38
no negativity ever allowed in cryptocurrency world is i what i learned. get downvoted hard as fuck if u mention the price going down even a little bit.
