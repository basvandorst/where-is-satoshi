Interesting to find that on New Zealand's TradeMe ebay clone after you scroll down past the scammy copper/gold "bitcoins" that have no value and outdated mining equipment you can find listings for property, motorcycles, cars and farming equipment with payment accepted in bitcoin.
A bit of background:  
1) TradeMe is a NZ ebay clone that got off the ground before ebay worked here. Only NZ residents (and recently AUZ) can have accounts, so international scamming is reduced a bit.
2) NZ has free electronic transfers between bank accounts, so there is no need for Paypal or Paypal-like pseudo-currencies to handle electronic transfers. Generally it takes 4-6 hours for a payment to post between accounts in different banks these days. 
3) On one hand you might think this would limit the growing space of Bitcoin, but on the other hand since there isn't a eBay/Paypal collusion to keep Bitcoin out and a policy of almost all payments occurring outside of the site anyway, it looks to be allowed and have some level of uptake.
Anyone aware of other ebay-like markets with significant levels of trade in bitcoin?

Ok, I guess this is just a technical possibility. Seems like the edge case of a block being solved without any transactions included would have been disallowed as a non-functional operation, but perhaps in early days this was a more common occurrence to keep blocks flowing on 10 minutes intervals.
