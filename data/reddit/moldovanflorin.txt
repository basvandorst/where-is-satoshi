When I submit a request to Kraken with this problem" Get Verified === Feature disabled", I not receive an email with a ticket number.
I only receive just this messaje : 
We are aware of issues that are resulting in difficulties for users who are trying to get verified and are seeing a 'feature unavailable' or 'feature disabled' error message. As you may be aware, these problems have been exacerbated due to the fact that we have been seeing extremely heavy traffic to the site and a massive influx of new users recently.
Our developers have been notified of this incident and are working to troubleshoot and fix it as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, users cannot start to fund their account and trade until the verification issue is solved and completed. While we don't currently have an ETA on when it will be released, however it should be ready for release soon.
Also, please note that you may find useful to know that other users have attempted to open new accounts with our exchange and most of the times they were able to get verified with their new accounts. In that case you would require to use another email and username. I hope this helps!
Sorry for any inconvenience caused by this and thank you for your patience and understanding while we are working to resolve these issues.
Please, do not hesitate in contacting us again if this does not answer your question or if you experience any other issues.

How can I find the ticket number?
Thank you
