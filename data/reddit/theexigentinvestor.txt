The peer to peer cash bit is my only beef.
I want peer to peer money that I own, (and can hopefully eventually conceal like monero does now).
I think there are a lot of in betweeners like me out there. I'm not a die hard Bitcoin fan, and there are certainly things about Bitcoin Cash that I dislike.
I don't use the words satoshis vision but I do think that the point of bitcoin as outlined, and the point many people like me rallied behind was peer to peer cash. 
Personally I'm worried about lightning. The hub and spoke model that seems to be imminent gets in the way of my love for peer to peer money and my hope for eventual privacy.
Tl;Dr - peer to peer is the OG Bitcoin definition and point and I think people fear Bitcoin is moving away from that in it's layer two solutions. This may be described as deviating from "satoshis vision"

Bitcoin.org delisted coinbase from it's websites...clearly both parties excluding someone...the difference being that coinbase is a private company and Bitcoin is in theory decentralized and equal to all. So I don't mind at all.
If you don't like it consider supporting decentralized exchanges like OMG is building so that foul play is impossible.
