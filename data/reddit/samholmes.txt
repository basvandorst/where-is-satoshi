Let's get somethings straight so we properly educate anyone who chooses to read this misinformation.
"It’s not just Facebook. Corporations have huge amounts of data about us, and even if they don’t misuse it, hackers could get into their databases. This shows why we need crypto and decentralization. Decentralized systems could prevent a lot of this in the future."
Decentralization itself isn't the end-all-be-all solution. Yes, centralized data storage is a central point of failure for misuse and exploitation (hacker target). However, Bitcoin's data is replicated across every node participating in the network. A hacker wouldn't need to break-in to anything, as the information is readily available and public. The assumption here is wrong. Decentralization has nothing to do with data privacy.
"But in Bitcoin, there would be no central authority they could attack, and all the data is essentially anonymous."
The data is not anonymous. You give up your identity to whom you transact. If you can maintain your personal privacy at all times when you interact with the bitcoin network, then you can maintain some level of anonymity.
"If these corporations adopted blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, this wouldn’t happen."
It's not as simple as this. It's ignorant to think that simply sprinkling on some technology solves a problem. Instead, one would have to invent a new technology inspired by technologies like a blockchain database or other technologies within the cryptocurrency industry. 
With all that said. I believe this post should be down voted. It is spreading misinformation and generalities that enthusiast such as myself would frown upon. I'd suggest one should do their research before posting such illegitimate journalism.
