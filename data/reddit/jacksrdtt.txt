And to do this I just install wallet software onto my computer or smartphone right?
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:56:54
You are absolutely right! Lol. Issue is I'm in the middle of a few things with no computer, no bank account. Only an android device and cash. But as soon as I get my hands on a computer I will.

so tell me something, how is it possible to store bitcoin ona thumb drive? If I used mycelium is it as easy as copy and pasting files?  
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:20:46
Good info. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:08:24
With say Google drive?

Very cool, and if I want to withdraw any certain amount? Do I upload my keys to an exchange site and sell them for dollars?
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:47:44
I've been reading a lot about cold wallets and paper wallets. I really do like the idea. 
If I'm following correctly. I could have bitcoin stored on a cold wallet and transfer an amount I'd like to cash to a darkwallet and then sell from there right?
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:17:59
I understand. But even with this, the company unsystem could give me away if they were forced too do so. Am I correct?
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:58:40
Can someone please explain exactly what role this woman had to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:10:27
How is darkwallet different than any other wallet??
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:26:26
I know, I'm asking a lot lol. But if I'm going to invest Ive got to understand compelety! So how is signing the keys done?? 
@_date: 2014-01-19 16:08:51
none of those links are active?
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:44:42


Sounds good to me.
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:41:20
I understand, well not really. I do understand a bit better and I'm looking forward to seeing this project done. 
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:20:07
I see. But that's not really a good thing. I mean, what is the value of Bitcoin. The value of it should be that it is a secure reliable untraceable alternative to cash. Not gold.

Make you're life easy. If you can afford to lose the $30k just buy now. Don't even think about it until bitcoin exploads. I honestly think if it dips it couldn't go under 6k at this point, but I'm sure within the next year it will hit 20k again if not more. That's just me. I put in roughly $1000 a month and try not to think about it.
@_date: 2019-12-06 08:13:10
I know this sounds stupid but I couldn't draw for shit on the cashapp. Did you do this by hand or is there an app that makes it easier??
@_date: 2019-12-07 12:06:06
How so??
@_date: 2019-12-06 08:15:34
Ahhhh okay
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:59:59
local bitcoins is your only option
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:57:03
Lol wut?
EDIT: looked it up. Very good project.
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:57:37
Lol they seem not too interested at the moment.

Woah. A debit card you can fill your bitcoins with?! 
I just read the entire article. Let me just make sure, if I wanted to get the Bitpay or Shift card could I use this at any store? Around town? To get gas at the gas station? They were talking about how a couple of the cards have no name on them so online retailers won't accept them. Is that the case with the Bitpay and Shift cards?
