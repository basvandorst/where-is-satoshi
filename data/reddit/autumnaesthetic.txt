I learned this lesson the hard way when I traveled to China (Beijing, Qingdao, Xi'an) and tipped my first "sit down" meal.. the waitresses were not happy. I didn't speak a lick of Mandarin and I was offended myself until I figured out what the cultural cues taught me. 
I still enjoy tipping and being tipped (especially on this sub), but the bots need to tone it down because of clutter. There needs to be a universal "private" tip (if there already isn't, please point me in the right direction).

I've been thinking about buying $5 or $10 worth of BTC lately. 
I just need to make the jump! Ahhhh.

Thank you for the advice!

I read about that.. does cold storage or "vaults" protect against someone "running off" with all the BTC on any particular site?

I was browsing and happened upon the freebie subreddit. I've also been interested for a while and was reading about it more earlier today. Finally decided to make the jump and learn some more.

I've spent most of the day reading about bitcoin and finally decided to create a wallet and come to reddit for some more guidance. This community is awesome.

I'm almost convinced, and I want to invest, but the fact that I have to input all my bank account info to buy BTC makes me skeptical.. Even if it's never happened that someone was robbed since inception, it seems weird that I can't paypal or something some USD to BTC...
