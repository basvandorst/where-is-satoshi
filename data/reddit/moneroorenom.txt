I have purchased my domain name, paid for hosting and a vps, and bought stuff on Amazon in the last week.   All with Bitcoin and all perfectly legal.

Bitcoin will always be used for illegal things.  As will cash, credit cards, other cryptocurrencies, and the barter system if need be.  I will trade you 2 sheep and a goat for some crack.  Point being that will always be a part of any currency.  To claim that Bitcoin contains nothing but illegal transactions and needs to be avoided by those who wish to conduct legal buisness transactions is simply spreading FUD.

I do not disagree that the majority of people seem to acquire Bitcoin as an investment vehicle and not as a means to conduct transactions.  What I took exception with in your previous comment was that you were essentially saying all transactions for Bitcoin done outside of investments were illegal transactions.  I do not doubt that illegal transactions are a huge part of Bitcoin usage currently.  I do not think that it is ALL transactions minus a miniscule amount.

Basically.  Until the idea that cryptocurrency is only used for illegal activities changes, widespread acceptance will be impossible.

Sure! Feel free to gild my comment.
Do you have any stats that say all but a negligible amount of bitcoin are spent on strictly illegal transactions? 
I paid for my Amazon purchase with a Bitcoin debit card.  This is not a direct Bitcoin transaction so it is up for debate if it counts.
