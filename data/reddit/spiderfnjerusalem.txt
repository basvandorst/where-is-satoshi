If it helps adoption I'm okay with it as long as non-licensed alternatives are still available.

I don't see too much manipulation. Just human nature. It's a common problem.
Perhaps we can patch it. We'll see.

Wasn't that just the UK? 
As far as I know the law is designed pretty retarded as well and can be interpreted any way they like. So they can basically lock you up if they suspect something to be encrypted. Like if they find a .jpg file with a weird header or some corruption in it. They can just claim it's encrypted, because a lot of encrypted data is indistinguishable from random noise.

Bitcoin is more than the value of your wallet. Value, usage and adoption are good but the revolutionary thing is the blockchain technology. It's here to stay, in Bitcoin as well as other Cryptocoins or similar technological projects.

Well sure it's not nice. But I see all these crashes as a gradual learning process. People learn not to trust institutions.

Wow... I've read all your responses and you're just really, really wrong in almost everything you say. 
I'm not even sure where to start because I'm sure you are going to deny the viability of any solution we present to you by saying "meh, that's so haaaaard!"

I also believe it's a group of people. However I myself am switching between british and american english all the time. I learned british english at school, but the majority of english texts I read every day are written in american english. I can't really help mixing up the spelling occasionaly.

I'm fairly sure you can reprogram them.  You just can't extract the existing configuration and reprogramming will delete the mtgox configuration. 
At least that's how it is with every yubikey I heard of.

Who says it needs to be saved? This is all progress, perhaps improvement. Bitcoin isn't static, it is new and changing. Bitcoin in 5 years will not be the same as it is today. Maybe it will be better. If it proves to be unfixable people will migrate to another kryptocurrency with more useful and/or robust features, it's kind of like natural selection. 
Anarchism may just work in our favour.

Perhaps I was more rude than necessary. But I don't see the point in investing time in a discussion here. 
This just seems like one of those pointless Reddit conversations were reasonable arguments are meaningless.

Flash has been a dying platform for years. It's clunky, resource intensive and never worked that well on android either.

I see it as a learning process of the market. The market participants are learning to only trust their own wallet.

Both MIT and JSTOR dropped the case because it would have been petty to punish him for it. There was no aggrieved party in this case whatsoever but the stupid attorney still wouldn't let it go.

Not sure how it works for most services but gmail gives you the option to generate an application-specific password that you can use with thunderbird.
Kind of defeats the purpose of 2fa if you ask me.

I have little experience with Electrum but it is a popular wallet. Many people swear by it because it gives the user more control over the addresses and may be better at protecting your privacy.
At the moment I use Multibit HD, it's very simple and easy. I may switch to electrum at some point.
For highest security purposes I use Armory (requires &gt;100 GB of space).
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:00:28
You don't need to download the entire blockchain. You should use a lightweight client like Multibit HD for PC or Mycelium for android.

I would be hesitant to put all my eggs in one basket. 
It's quite possible that the mere act of buying bitcoin at that point in time might negatively impact the price in the long term, due to an unpredictable butterfly effect. Better to diversify your assets, just in case.

And that's why both deserve to be criticized. **No one** should be immune from criticism under any circumstances. Not youtube, not lying politicians, not the pope and not you, for making a useless point.
I criticize youtube and I criticize the chinese government but that doesn't change the fact that the proportions are different. Youtube isn't a government and the effect isn't as powerful.
A horrible state-wide system like the sesame score doesn't exist yet in the west but should someone try to do it you bet your ass I will criticize them for thinking it's a good idea. It's fucking horrible no matter who does it.
@_date: 2016-11-14 16:24:55
You're not making sense. You compared a rating system for individual videos on a video site to a mandatory government-backed rating system for humans with additional incentives and penalties. 
That's like comparing a motor bike to a cargo ship.

I'm not from the US but I like criticizing them all the same.
@_date: 2016-11-14 15:15:21
Um no, it's quite a bit worse than that. 
Not to say similar things don't happen in the west but this is the most horrifying use of gamification I've ever seen. 


Pointless argument. By that logic only angels are allowed to criticize.

But you have to go through financial institutions for that, are subject to scrutiny, the transactions can be frozen, have an upper limit, can be reversed and only work reliably within the USA, not internationally, at least not without limitations for private citizens.
