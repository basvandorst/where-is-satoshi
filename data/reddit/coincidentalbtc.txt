Didn't mean to steal your thunder, I just came across the article today during a search, and it reminded me of the endlessly repeating pattern of Bitcoin bubbles followed by naysayers saying I told you so (even while prices were at multiples higher than pre-bubble). This last bubble, I got a call from a friend telling me how sorry he was for me that Bitcoin failed.

Thanks, pmelt, for capturing this talk and thanks to all who attended. I'd say it was a huge success.

I gave Bald Bryan his first bitcoins for Christmas this year, and told him he should do a segment on the show. I'd like to think I had something to do with this.

Gem is a multisignature wallet platform that manages the process of creating multisignature transactions. We help developers manage multiple, distributed keys.
Chain is a great read-only query engine for the blockchain. Chain does not handle keys.
The two services are complementary. In fact, we use Chain for some of our own blockchain queries.
In other words, Chain allows you to query the blockchain for past transactions, Gem allows you to create new ones using multisig.

Well timed.

You're absolutely right. An automatically signed extra key doesn't help, that's why you need to have rules enforced on that transaction (like spending limits, fraud detection, whitelisting, multifactor authentication, etc.). One of the big benefits of multisig is that it allows for an independent third party to enforce those rules. Multisig is simply a tool that allows you to do this, but multisig alone is not a solution.
@_date: 2015-05-11 21:27:15
Sorry, I was responding to both your comment and OP's comment about wanting a debate on when multisig is not necessary.

This only makes sense if you're using separate devices to generate the keys. Otherwise, Shamir's sharing secrets (and eventually Threshold Signatures) is probably a better option since it gives you flexibility to change your key strategy on the fly without having to interact with the blockchain. The real advantage of multisig over other solutions is that it allows you to generate keys completely independent of each other on separate devices (or separate entities/companies). The downside to multisig is that the contract gets locked in place on the blockchain and can't be changed easily.
EDIT: The immutability aspect could also be seen as a benefit, depending on the use case.

Sorry we missed your email. Bruce is right, as you can imagine, the interest in blockchain technology is up, which means email volume is up too. I'll make sure that someone from our team follows up quickly. Can you send a quick email directly to hello and I'll make sure we respond to see if we're the right match for your project.

Not exactly. We are saying that the Thales Hardware Security Module is a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 Certified device. The software that is added would not be included in the FIPS certification, however, the software is loaded into a certified device, and the software executes entirely within the walls of the security boundary, including random number generation (using the certified RNG in the device), BIP32 wallet derivation, and ECDSA signing operations. All of those functions are executed within the walls of the HSM and private key material never leaves the device.
EDIT: I replaced the word 'firmware' with 'software' because we do not actually modify any firmware of the device. We load an application onto the device.
@_date: 2015-03-26 04:07:35
Let me clarify, we do not modify any device firmware which would invalidate the certification of the hardware. We securely load an application that executes core Bitcoin functionality within the security perimeter of the FIPS 140-2 Level 3 HSM. We are not claiming that the entire Bitcoin solution has been FIPS certified, but rather, the Bitcoin solution is executing within the protected barrier of the Level 3 HSM. Again, this is a common method amongst traditional banking and payment applications.
@_date: 2015-03-26 03:35:16
The device is indeed FIPS certified. The device is a Level 3 certified device. The application that runs within the device is not, and this is extremely common amongst banking and payment applications that run inside of these devices. We don't make the claim that the entire software solution has been certified by NCIS, nor do we think it's necessary. The goal of the Level 3 certification is to indicate that these devices are tamper resistant, and have been certified as such.

I'd just like to point out that the main encryption protocol used is actually Elliptic Curve Cryptography, not SHA256. Specifically the secp256k1 curve ( SHA256 is used as a one-way hash function to create bitcoin addresses from a known ECC public key. However, the public key behind the SHA256 hash gets revealed whenever bitcoins are spent from an address. So the real concern is whether or not ECC can be cracked, not SHA256.
SHA256 is also used in the process of mining, which does secure the network, but I think if SHA256 was cracked, we'd create a rapid hard fork, and miners would switch to a new hashing algorithm very rapidly (because they would be financially motivated to do so). Of course, this would render all current ASICs obsolete creating a temporary security concern, but we'd see a revival in GPU mining with a new algorithm until ASICs had a chance to catch up again.

I've written up an explanation in mostly layman terms regarding some of the benefits and use cases of an HD wallet at the top of the readme of my Ruby implementation at  . I get into some more technical aspects below it, so feel free to stop reading once you get the gist.

Yeah, you're totally right. Numbers, math and science are useless. I just let God tell me what's true. The point of the study was to disprove a long held belief that there was a satiation point of money vs happiness, meaning that at some level of income, more income no longer increased happiness and well-being. This study proves that belief false, that more money pretty much always brings more well-being regardless of income level.

I found it to be extremely straightforward and easy to understand, and even enjoyable to watch. It's the kind of video I'd send to my friends and family to get them thinking about "what is money?". It makes a great conversation starter to get people interested in Bitcoin.

The states do. It is entirely up to each state whether or not it requires money transmitter licensing, and in fact, a few states (Montana, South Carolina and New Mexico) don't require a license at all.

Yes, "HD" stands for "Hierarchical Deterministic".  I'm not sure who came up with "HD", but I guess they thought it would be catchier than what it actually stands for. =)

This license is not for users, it's for money transmitting businesses. And yes, businesses who move cash already do need a license.

The "BitLicense" referred to in this post is not a license that individual users of Bitcoin would need to acquire, it's specifically for companies which participate in money transmission. Currently, these businesses are ALREADY required to obtain a Money Transmitter license in most states, as are non-bitcoin businesses which transmit money (like Western Union). The problem is that the money transmitter rules and regulations were written for fiat currency transactions and not bitcoin transactions, so a lot of it is confusing and doesn't directly apply, thus creating a great deal of uncertainty for Bitcoin companies, and uncertainty is the great killer of all markets, including the Bitcoin market. By creating a "BitLicense", the DFS is finally addressing the problem of uncertainty. Would I prefer that the government stays out of the picture entirely? Certainly. But if you want to build a business that moves ANY money in the United States, then the existing money transmitter laws already apply to you. At least now the laws will be directly applicable to Bitcoin.
