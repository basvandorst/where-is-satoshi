I heard the new Raspberry Pi 4 has significantly more computing power than its predecessor. Is it capable of doing a full initial sync of the blockchain within a reasonable amount of time?
@_date: 2019-07-05 10:12:49
Awesome! Thanks for your reply.  
So basically opening and closing a channel (no matter how much is spent) breaks the link of ownership of a UTXO, with a 50/50 guess that either of the nodes the channel connected to is the new owner of the UTXO. There is no benefit in repeating this process multiple times with the same UTXO to improve your odds (privacy-wise) since that would be a dead giveaway that it's the same entity doing this repeatedly. 
The advantage of CoinJoin (and why people are willing to pay for this service) is that there is a much bigger privacy advantage (there is a \~1/80 chance they guess which UTXO is yours) and you can repeat this process over and over for increased privacy. 
Did I get that right?

Hi thanks for your elaborate reply, just what I was looking for. Much appreciated! :)
@_date: 2019-07-05 09:13:30
Hi Reddit. Quick question: 
Can a bystander tell the closing UTXO's for LN channels apart? 
For example: let's say I open a channel for 0.01 BTC. I spend non of the funds in the channel and immediately decide to close it again. This would result in a closing tx where all my 0.01 BTC (minus some fees ofc) goes back to me. Is it possible for somebody to tell if the channel contents all went back to me? 
Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:29:42
Out of curiosity.. What happens if you close a channel with a very low fee on a busy day and the transaction gets dumped in the mempool for a while? Does the channel stay open during this period? 
@_date: 2018-08-16 11:04:00
Alright! Thnx for the reply! :)

If I'm not mistaken, if the 2% is increased 100x, you would result in aproximately 67% of the world's energy consumption. 
However: given the current hashrate of roughly 50 million TH/s, you would need about 345 million new antminer S9's to be turned on (assuming 14.5 TH/s and a very simple linear relation between hash power and power consumption) to increase the mining operations 100x. At $500 a piece, this would represent an cumulative investment of about $172 billion dollars. Beside the fact that there is absolutely no requirement for more miners to be turned on in order to increase market size, I think we can all agree that this kind of inflow of money and material is very unrealistic in the foreseeable future.

I'm not much into computers but I figured I'd do my share and support the Bitcoin Network. 
So I booted up an old computer in the attic, downloaded Bitcoin Core and let it run. It was running for over a year before I read somewhere you have to allow incoming connections in order to *actually* support lightweight clients and other full nodes. That kinda made me feel like an idiot. I'd basically been running a glorified wallet for over a year, but hey, it works now and it feels good! :)  
Just wanted to get the word out here so maybe I can prevent someone making the same mistake in the future!  
@_date: 2018-10-31 13:55:41
Awesome, thnx for sharing. Interesting stuff, I've never actually heard of this FIBRE network until now. From what I understand you run this side by side Bitcoin Core and it's an essential part of the network. Funny that I've never heard people promoting the "Run your own FIBRE" instead of "Run your own node".. Gonna read up on this. Thnx for sharing and sorry for the late reply!

This makes it sound like there's a guy at the head of the mining pool consistently monitoring what his miners do and manually picks the chain which he deems most likely to succeed. I would imagine this process is automated, right? Is there some kind of algorithm or method miners use to pick which chain has the highest chance of becoming the longest chain?   
On that same note: if all miners used this same technique to pick a chain, that would automatically knock out the "less-likely-chain", so I guess this would have to be randomized in order to ensure fairness/decentralization? 
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:01:18
First block seen would make sense, since it doesn't really matter which chain you pick. The first seen would at least grant you the benefit of time. 
I assume that miners would want to connect their nodes closely to the big mining pools so the propagation time of new blocks is minimal and, in case you find the next block, the big pools are among the first to hear so there is a bigger chance of a new block being found on top of yours?
With that in mind: do you have any idea what a normal block propagation time is? I would imagine a 1MB block to propagate over the modern internet would be a matter of seconds, so the chance of 2 miners both finding a block within this time window seems fairly slim, right?
@_date: 2018-06-18 07:01:02
Nevermind the investors. Look at what the "Bank" of International Settlements (which strangely isn't a bank at all) is and you'll understand why they rightly should be terrified by something like Bitcoin. 
Despite the fact that their origins are extremely dubious (apparenty started by American capitalist elite to control the world's money flow and indebt governments) they have a very unfriendly resumé. Not only does Switzerland have no jurisdiction over their HQ (now why would that be?) but they are also accused of a wide range of baffling crimes. From funding Germany during WW2 to laundering Nazi money. With prominent board members such as CEOs of IG Farben, who supplied the Nazi's with gas for their gas chambers, this doesn't come as a surprise. The list of dubious activity goes on. There are heaps of books on this subject. I highly advise you read one. It'll knock your socks off. 
The BIS's goal is to create global monetary stability (as per their website) but since its inception, the biggest financial crises have occured. Strange, huh? 
I believe Bitcoin is the only possible tool we have to get rid of these crooks, who will start world wars to justify their beliefs and fill their pockets doing so. I also strongly believe this is the main reason why Satoshi decided to disappear. A good decision, if you ask me. These guys will do whatever it takes to stay on top. 
Am I into Bitcoin for the money? Maybe.. Am I into it to wave a big fat middle finger at these dudes? Hell yeah!

There are some options to create inbound liquidity at the moment at a reasonably low fee rate. 
[ \- the Lightning to BTC converter allows you to spend 0.005 BTC from your lightning channels and you are refunded 0.005 BTC minus 2000 sats fee. Fee rate \~0.4%. 
[Zigzag.io]( \- allows you to convert lightning in on-chain BTC. Min. fee rate \~0.5%
[Lightningto.me]( \- if you open a channel, they will match it with a 0.02 BTC return channel free of charge. 
[Yalls.org]( \- offers 0.02 BTC return channels @ \~7000 sat fee. 
There's plenty more services that allow you to convert your LN balance to on-chain BTC. Almost all of them require you to trust the other party at the moment. Future improvements will hopefully find a trust-less way to convert LN balance to on-chain BTC,so you can balance your channels easily and at a reasonably low fee rate. At the moment, you still gotta put some effort in to it, since LN is still in the early stages. 
If none of the above float your boat, you can always ask people to open a channel to you, this will also create inbound liquidity! 
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:57:43
Alright. I figured something along these lines, but thanks for clearing that up. 
I heard of watchtowers, but I figured it would be neat if there is a DIY/trustless way to achieve a fail-safe. 
Anyway, thank you for taking the time to reply!

I picked up a copy of the magazine after work. To be honest, the cover is somewhat misleading. In the story, Scrooge only "digitalizes" his physical money and then the internet crashes. There's no actual reference to Bitcoin at all, besides 1 guy in a restaurant, who's name is "Berend Bitcoin", so who knows what he bought..
Anyhow: I've got a spare copy in case someone is interested.
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:31:04
But if I run the watchtower software myself, I would still have to be online 24/7, correct? (or at least once every uncooperative-close-time-gap)
I understand my channel states are private, and hence broadcasting a channel state to a 3rd party watchtower would reveal the exact funds my node has. Obviously this is not diserable, so there's got to be some way to hide the channel balance, but the watchtower's still gotta know which balance is right... Sounds like something some smart cryptographer's gotta solve :) 
Anyway, would you happen to know of any place that explains what's going on under the hood of the watchtowers? Most of the stuff I find seems fairly old and I'm not sure if it's outdated! 
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:06:15


This much I understand. But setting up an operation to achieve 51% hashrate would mean someone's gotta knock on Bitmain's door and buy nearly 4 million antminers. That's not gonna happen.
What would be more interesting is to see if there are for example supercomputers or datacenters already up and running which could be mobilized by a milicious actor to strangle the network. Does this at all belong to the realm of possiblities?

If you want a little more detail about Neutrino, check out this blog! 
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:43:06
There was a neat article that explained Neutrino in simple terms, but I can't find it at the moment. Maybe someone here can help.
What I remember from it in laymen's terms is that in Neutrino, all the adresses that send/receive transactions in a block are 'summarized'  based on some very cool math. Each 'block summary' is very lightweight and easily downloadable through mobile bandwidth (ie: a couple kB).
Your Neutrino client downloads the 'summaries' of the adresses and checks to see if the block contains any transactions to or from adresses you control. The Neutrino client can perform these checks without actually having to reveal the actual which adresses you control to anyone (mind-blowing, I know!). If the client finds a match, it downloads the relevant block, and there you have your lightweight BTC client!
So basically, as stated in the comments above, it comes down to a lightweight client which doesn't use a lot of bandwidth, but grants better privacy because you don't have to reveal which adresses you control to anyone.
Please correct me if I'm wrong, since I have no technical knowledge/skill whatsoever. I just love reading up on this stuff :)
*Also:* 'regular' lightweight SPV clients need to *trust* a full node, that it supplies them the correct information of adress balances. With Neutrino, you do not need this trust. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 13:33:42
As a layman, I am genuinely interested in what's going on here. Let's see if I understand this correctly (go easy on me please :)
When signing a transaction, my wallet uses a random input (called a nonce), together with my private key and the actual transaction data to generate a cryptographical signature which proves I generated and want to make this transaction. 
The researchers from the article managed to determine the private keys that were used to generate two different signatures from the same address. Like this: 
BTC Address 1: private key A + transaction P + nonce X = signature 1  
BTC Address 1: private key A + transaction R + nonce X = signature 2
Because the same (or similar?) nonce was used to sign both transactions, it is possible to determine the private key that was used to generate the signatures, putting any remaining funds in the used address at risk. 
So the take away from this is to never re-use addresses, and always use new change addresses (which should be default behavior anyway) or is there more going on here? I fail to grasp the 'poor entropy in nonce generation' idea. Using two similar but different nonces should produce wildly different signatures, right? 
Anyhow, an explanation in layman's terms would be very much appreciated! :)   
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:45:08
I suppose we'll be many years into the future before this happens. With the development of computing power, a small block size increase may be warranted. 
Furthermore, developments like Schnorr and Segwit reduce transaction sizes, and thus reduce network congestions. 
Also, although not very sexy to Bitcoin Maximalists, Atomic Swaps across different blockchains and LN's can be used to refill your channels. So for example you make a LTC transaction to refill your BTC LN channel. 
Finally,  I have faith in the BTC team to find clever solutions to complex problems like this! 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:27:24
It should be noted that the Bank of International Settlements is [the mother of all central banks]( That being said: they have **everything** to lose, should Bitcoin gain mainstream traction. **These guys are the reason Bitcoin existst!** Furthermore, these guys published a [negative report]( on cryptocurrencies no more than half a year ago (summary: it solves no real problem, slow, cannot scale, consumes vast amounts of energy) and now they come around full swing and say "the societal value of Bitcoin is substantial" and Bitcoin will probably "complement and improve existing monetary financial infrastructure" ?! 
Pardon my tinfoil hat, but I'm guessing somebody's quietly getting on-board and accumulating because they realise this is a battle they just can't win. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 07:02:35
I gave the node a static IP based on MAC address and portforward + porttriggered to there. Not exactly sure about all the other specs but I can have a look when I get home! :) I'll open up a channel with you when I get there! 
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:33:25
Alright. Thanks for the explanation. 
There's still one thing I don't quite get. The odds of two nonces being similar when using randomly generated nonces would be quite slim, right? Even if 'random' isn't truly random but quite close. Is there a way to manually provide the nonce for your signature? I would imagine this would lead to a much greater chance of making a mistake and getting similar nonces. 
  
@_date: 2019-01-04 10:50:42

That's gonna happen sooner than you think. Don't forget, we're already at \~17.4 million mined BTC out of 21 million. (That's nearly 83%!) 
As we all know the block reward halves every 210 000 blocks (4 years, more or less). If you plot this on a scale, you will see that nearly 95% of all BTC will have been mined by 2030, and by 2040 it will be &gt;99%. At this point it will take 100 more years before the last Satoshi is mined, but the impact on the overal circulating supply will be minimal. Here's a neat little overview to give you an idea: [
So to sum it up, you've got maybe 15-20 more years to go before pretty much all BTC will be in circulation! Use this knowledge to your advantage! ;)

Let's make some *very* crude calculations to get a ballpark figure of what we need to sustain the network with transaction fees alone in it's current state!
\- Current hashrate is approximately 40 EH/s. This is 40 million TH/s.
\- Assuming everyone uses Antminer S9's (14 TH/s @ 1350 Watts), this would require 2.85 million antminers running.
\- The power usage by these miners is \~3.85 MW/hour. At roughly $0.07 / kWh, the cost of running the network is $270'000,- per hour.
\- Currently miner transaction fees are somewhere between 0.1 and 0.4 BTC per block, depending on network congestion.
\- Blocks are 10 minutes apart. The hourly transaction fees are between 0.6 and 2.4 BTC / hour. For the sake of the example, let's say it's 1 BTC / hour.
Based on the above calculations, we would need the value of **1 BTC to be \~$270k** to break even on the power costs. Add on some more for buying the miners and maintenance, and you're probably looking at max. $300k / BTC to sustain the network in a healthy manner. Given that this situation doesn't happen for another 15-20 years means we can slowly grow into it.
*Note: t*he above calculations are very crude and obviously miss out on a lot of matters which could drive the price (more competition among miners, growth of the network, more energy efficient miners, potential block cap increases, higher/lower fees etc. etc.) but it gives a very crude estimation.
*Another note:* current block reward per hour is 6 x 12.5 = 75 BTC. At $4300, I suppose this should be enough to cover the cost of setting up shop and running the miners (given the energy price of $0.07).

I don't want to give anyone ideas, but if the end game is to frustrate the system until people get fed up and abandon Bitcoin for government issued currencies, I would say that's a priceless gain. Especially if the party spearheading the attack can create money to fuel the attack out of thin air and stands to lose pretty much everything when Bitcoin becomes a global success. 
Come to think of it, I'm actually surprised this is not a thing yet.

This seems to be the right spot to ask this question I've had for a while. Please note, while I understand the way Bitcoin works, my understanding of other blockchain-related topics is limited. 
With Bitcoin, the security and immutability of the blockchain is obtained by letting many users compete for winning hashes to mine blocks. These blocks basically store the data on the blockchain, which is then visible to anybody. The incentive to mine is that he who mines blocks is rewarded in BTC for the effort. 
Now take, for example, a supply chain management blockchain. I understand it is possible to write data (ie: what is shipped in a container, when it was shipped, if customs approved it etc.) to a blockchain, but who would want to help maintain this blockchain? I can imagine that there is no incentive for the average Joe, so how is the immutability of the blockchain obtained to a degree that there is no scrutiny as to whether the data in the blockchain is correct? 
Would this only be done by the shipping companies? If so, that doesn't sound very reassuring that the entity maintaining the blockchain has the most to gain with malicious behaviour. Can someone elaborate on this please? :) 
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:31:52
I recall a talk from Andreas where he mentioned that exchanges have to comply to KYC regulations, and that those rules don't go hand in hand with LN. Hence, he would not expect big exchanges to offer those kinds of services in the (near) future. 
I'm not really up to speed about the technical side of the LN, but I believe it had something to do with each node only knowing where the next "hop" goes to, and not the actual final destination of the payment. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong though.

@_date: 2018-12-07 11:00:01


See it as your $5 investment into a healthy BTC ecosystem. You'd have to pay these fees sooner or later anyway. 


Exchanges batch transactions so impact is less than you'd think. Also, if we start early, impact can be minimized. 


This is a good point, but people with large sums of money usually have higher KYC clearance, so all in all I think the majority of the people should be able to get out of there within a reasonable timespan. 


True, but in the ideal case where everyone participates, there would be little to no swing since there's very little / no BTC for sale on the exchange. 
On the other hand, if exchanges did sell more BTC than they actually have in pocket, somebody somewhere is bound to get screwed if we caused a 'bank-run'. You can ask yourself if you want to be the one responsible for those losses.

I've been using Eclair for a while. After the initial sync you just open a channel or two and you're good to go. It's very easy and works like a charm when I want to show off LN to friends/family. For now, you can only make payments, but in the future you'll be able to receive on the go as well!
