70 years to grow? That's a crazy amount of time for them to go up!

Bitcoin will never hit 0.

Who said it's funding ISIS? It's not a debt it's a helping fee. You can't just stay in a place for free other then your mom's basement can you? There is always fees for everything in life get over it. If they do use it for bad there's nothing we can do about it and they'll probably get found out anyways because not everyone is bad and not everyone keeps secrets.

So you'd rather not have healthcare, roads, firefighters, cops, paramedics, hospitals, parks, schools, etc.?
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:26:59
I second this.

Either the end of this year or by the end of next year. I can't wait to see!!

As I laugh when I'm floating in my yacht when ETH and LTC skyrocket. Hehehe altcoins are the hidden treasure at the end of the long BTC rainbow!
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:40:46
LTC is the shadow of BTC. It's said to hit 25% of BTC in the future. LTC is a long term investment I think. If you want to make money faster ETH or BTC would be the way to go or keep buying in and out of cryptos and slowly build up while taking great risk. If I could afford 1 BTC I would buy it once it drops to 10k if it ever does again. I wouldn't sell it until BTC hits 100k like it is said to hit in the future. But what do I know...

You're obviously too baked or drunk to be looking at anything crypto related. Put it down for a while. ������

Sooooooo how about we just pay our taxes like good little citizens we are? There's nothing wrong with paying taxes because they use it to better our city and roads and fuckin everything we need so shut the hell up and pay. If they INCREASE taxes then say something.

This is why you make small time transactions at first and test it out... Never go all in unless you're 500% sure! Check everything 10 times.

If the Internet goes down anywhere it's fixed within 24 hours usually and there would be country wide terror. Not many people can live or even function without the internet.
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:25:27
There would be too many people who'd "disappear" for the rest of their lives and they'd have tons of money to make sure they couldn't be found. There's no way to do this now a days.

The price won't go down majorly unless a whale sells off. That won't happen unless the price increases a lot and I mean what you said probably not until we see $100,000 per Bitcoin at least. The hodlers are way too good at hodling and that's what keeps Bitcoin standing. The prophecy is too strong with Bitcoin giving people too much faith but that's a good thing. Just wait for 5 years and you'll have your fortunes.
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:27:55
You're right on that point but the government can't take my bitcoin if they don't even know I have any but they can sure take my gold as seen in the past so you tell me which one is better? Gold is not a safe haven. Bitcoin is and always will be.

These numbers blow my mind. Nothing compares to the amazement of Bitcoin. I really hope this is true.
@_date: 2019-08-01 12:29:14
Stop selling. Never sell. Only buy low. Unless you're planning on being a whale yourself only buy low and hodl. Best strategy. You will make money. Let the whales control the influx of prices. They will never let Bitcoins price go down unless they're ready to sell but they won't be until atleast $100,000 a Bitcoin.

You gave it back because of KARMA and because it's the right thing to do. Yes you could of blocked his number and ran with your free 3,000$ but seriously karma is a real thing man. You did the right thing.
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:58:27
I'm sorry you feel this way. Not everyone has to believe in the same thing. Everyone has their own opinion and no opinion can be wrong because it's an opinion. I was also just complimenting OP and saying what I believe in as a "karma move". Do you say the same thing about miracles?
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:24:18
Yeah but you know Trump doesn't believe in Bitcoin which is the most foolish mistake anyone can make in today's world. If you don't own a bitcoin or any fraction of a bitcoin by 2020 what are you doing??
