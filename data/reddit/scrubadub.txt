Assuming you received bitcoin to a change address from that transaction, you can spend that change to yourself with a higher fee. Then you're manually building a cpfp transaction. I assume that miners weigh the average fee/byte across both transactions though, so you will need a higher fee on the second transaction (around 80ish)

If a block is mined very shortly after the prior block, miners sometimes don't have time to verify all of the previous transactions against the mem pool. So if they mined a block, they're not sure which transactions they should include in their block. They first have to verify transactions in the mem pool didn't become invalid from the previous block. 
If they just guess and happen to include an invalid transaction, their whole block becomes invalid. If they wait to verify all the transactions, it takes longer to build their block, giving other miners the chance to find and release their own block. It is safer and more profitable for them to just not include any transactions besides the coinbase

1. They do nothing, they still control the majority and could achieve whatever goals they want. There is no major benefit to dropping someone. He says on the board, and they have to listen to his dissenting opinions, he might offer ideas/suggestions you weren't considering when dealing with future issues. No external drama created, we would not be talking about this right now if they chose this path.
2. Or... you get mad that he doesn't see your way, and you decide to kick him off. Again you could already do everything you wanted since you have the majority. All kicking him off the board does is make you feel better and send a message you can't deal with dissent. This creates drama, instead of just letting things go.

Sentencing doesn't have to repair any damage done, to take damage into account for punishment. 
It is not solely to create a disincentive (though that is part of it). Removing the offender from society prevents them from doing further damage.
How would you suggest punishment be determined, solely on intent? So if I try to do something good and end up doing a lot of damage I shouldn't be punished? It would be hard to prove intent, a drunk driver could argue he didn't intend to hurt anyone, even though his actions were reckless.

For other's interested in what is going on (ELI5), you can generate an address without having a private key. Take a look at [how a bitcoin address is created](
See how you can start in the middle at [1][20] with any 20 bytes you want, but to make a valid address you have to double sha256 those 21 bytes and add on the checksum. 
After you're done you'll have a valid bitcoin address, but you won't have the private keys so no one can spend those coins. You effectively started with a public key, and you can't easily determine the private key from the public key.
This is distinctly different from generating a vanity address where you start generating private keys, and using the matching public key you determine if the final address matches what you want. However this is a brute force approach and you can usually only generate 6-9 characters before it becomes too computationally expensive to create a custom address.

Ugh, every post is a straw man with you


Duh? Where did I say there isn't a memory pool? They're in the memory pool until they're confirmed in a block. While they're in the memory pool it can be a race condition. Did you read petertodd's post about how he ACTUALLY FUCKING DID WHAT YOU SAY CAN'T BE DONE. 
Since the answer is no, I'll spell it out for you. When the default fee was reduced in version 0.9 most miners didn't upgrade right away. They rejected many transactions that used a fee below the previous release's default. He created a lower fee transaction that would only be mined by a smaller percentage of the network, then a second higher fee transaction that would be mined by a larger percentage of the network. And achieved success with double spends.


True for the default client, [though others have made clients that do exactly that.]( What are you going to do, plead with them not to run those clients? While TXs are in the memory pool it can be a race condition, for different reasons. But you have to understand that people can do bad things during this time, and miners can include whatever txs they want in their blocks. It looks like you're just hoping everyone is running the default client and following all of the default rules.

They explained it later on, but the wording they used in what you quoted was a poor choice of words.
Since the goal is to determine the source IP address, on their attacking/logging nodes they block connections from any tor exit node. This means connections to their logging servers must come from outside of the Tor network.
A better way to state it is "we're ignoring any user that utilizes Tor, because we cant find their source IP anyway"

I dont think the math is correct. You calculate the bitcoin lost over the whole 2016 blocks as if the difficulty is constantly increasing. But the only time wasted on a smaller pool is from the last block found at the current difficulty, until the difficulty changes. Here's a short example to better explain my point.
Example 1: Pretend the difficulty is static, it doesnt matter how big of a pool you use, everyone gets paid the same obviously 
Example 2: The difficulty doubles every 2016 blocks
With a small pool say they mine a block every 504 blocks on average (block 1, 505, 1009, 1513)
With a large pool with 4x the hashrate say they mine a block every 126 blocks on average (block 2, 128, 254, 380, 506, 632, 758, 884, 1010, 1136...)
Now let's look at blocks 1-1000. Small pool: found 2 blocks, large pool found 8. Since the large pool has 4x the hash rate in this example you would get 1/4 the payout per block. Meaning if you contribute 1% of the mining power of the small pool you get paid:
0.01 * 25 * 2 = 0.5btc
and on the large pool you have 1/4 of 1% of the hash rate so on the large pool you get:
0.0025 * 25 * 8 = 0.5btc
The only time a large pool helps you is between when your pool mines the last block before the difficulty changes, but not across the entire 2016 blocks. (tx fees may help you with more blocks, but probably not by enough to matter)

That way if an attacker MITM's your notifications and blocks/deletes them, it wont help them. You must get the message and digitally sign it with pre-defined addresses specified as yours.
If you want to add an address to "your addresses" you have to sign a message from a previous address defined as yours.

Hidden services "tor" (meaning setup a 3 hop connection) to introduction points. The hidden service announces to the hidden service directory servers "if you're trying to get to abcdefghijk.onion, talk to my introduction points."
So you try to get to a hidden service, you find the introduction point(s) from the hidden service directory servers. But you dont directly connect, you setup a 3 hop connection to the introduction point. 
That introduction point knows only how to relay traffic to the node before it, that one knows how to relay to the hop before it, that one knows how to relay traffic to the hidden service (those nodes in the path don't know they're passing hidden service data)
From this communication you setup a slightly shorter path for future communication

Difficulty scales as a factor of the ~~number of users mining~~ total hashrate of the network. The goal is to have a block mined every 10 minutes. If 5x the number of people start mining, and without adjusting the difficulty you'd have a block every 2 minutes. So every ~2 weeks the difficulty adjusts so on average a block is mined every 10 minutes.
Currently with massive additions of new hashing power the difficulty is lagging behind the true mining power since it adjusts every 2 weeks. Which is why the block halving doesnt happen every 4 years, it happens every 3 years and 11ish months.

Maybe I'm missing something but with bitcoin there are a set of trusted nodes that you initially connect to if you dont know of anyone else. Then they share other nodes IP addresses that are also bitcoin nodes that you can connect to and start downloading blocks/txs.
So the question is, if you have a HS bitcoin node that never really has an ipv4 clearnet address, I imagine other bitcoin nodes would reject or just ignore your HS address and not pass it on to others.
To get any traffic you'd have to have individuals set your node up manually as one to connect to.

One entity mines a block. Originally everyone was mining individually and if you found a block you got 100% of the reward (plus transaction fees).
Today it is so hard to mine a block individually many people join a pool and when the pool finds a block, the pool is rewarded. The pool then splits out the payment to the miners of that pool based on how much they contributed to mining yes. 
The reward system gets a little more complicated than that, for example many use [PPLNS rewards](

* Moving away from the bitcoind executable functioning both as a server and as a RPC client. The RPC client functionality ("tell the running bitcoin daemon to do THIS") was split into a separate executable, 'bitcoin-cli'. The RPC client code will eventually be removed from bitcoind, but will be kept for backwards compatibility for a release or two.

It seems to be common knowledge that the longest block chain wins, but is that really the case?
If I take block 2000 with a low difficulty and mine using asics of today while artificially recreating the blockchain (spoofed timestamps) at a similar pace and keeping the difficulty low because I'm the only one mining on this fork, I could re-create the block chain up to today in a few weeks.
To prevent this I've heard that it is actually not the longest block chain, but the block chain with the highest difficulty. This makes more sense and would stop that attack.

@_date: 2014-06-26 16:47:24


It is both, from your own [link](




You seem to think that the first tx broadcast will make it into a block, which is not true. I could simply rebroadcast a new transaction with a higher fee (before the next block) and break your offline dual-broadcast transaction method. [see it done here]( and a service to do it for you [here](
Harder to do but still possible is to broadcast my tx from a more well connected node. TX's were rebroadcast only after 100ms, this was a problem in the malleability issue a few months back. Hard to find a reference right now but [here]( is a mention from a bitcoin dev. 
Meaning if you broadcast a transaction to a few nodes that are not well connected, it make take 5 rebroadcasts until it hits a node that is mining. I on the other hand could be connected to the mining nodes directly. So if I could detect, generate, and broadcast a new tx in &lt;~500ms I may beat you. IE race condition.


Never said it did, it only requires one node. And you'll be more successful the more connections you have. If you wanted to optimize the last few ms you could run multiple nodes on different sides of the planet but that is probably not worth it.
For bandwidth I already referenced exactly how much bandwidth it takes, and in all my posts I argued against the "10MB/s" number.


You're trying to correct minor details but you're the one who is wrong. A bitcoin address is a "hashed public key" as I stated. [see here]( I decided to use that phrase because you attempted to correct me for saying "this brainwallet" before. I tried to be more technical for you.

Thanks for the answers, one more question.


But that 0.0008 is going to a public address, not a stealth address. So this transaction seems to only be setting up the use of a stealth address and not transferring money to it. 
If that's true, then why not just send 0.0001 (miner fee) with a single output OP_RETURN and achieve the same goal (adding the stealth address data in the blockchain, without sending money to another public address).

Addresses hold bitcoins, that address can be used in multiple locations (with some concerns such as change addresses being generated only on one of the machines). 
As for security you should consider all the locations that have the private key to your addresses that have bitcoins. For example it doesnt make much sense from a security perspective to have the private key from an online wallet also offline. That is a perfect way to back up the private keys in case of hard drive failure, but it does not improve your security. 
Think of it like printing out 3 copies of your private key to an address. Then keeping one in a secure location like a safe deposit box, one under your mattress, and one left in the open on your desk at work. The first two are probably mostly secure, but if the third one isnt, all of your coins can be stolen. 
Instead you should probably hold the bulk of your coins in an offline wallet of some kind, and a smaller amount that you are willing to risk on an online wallet.

The Op is all over the place and doesn't directly make this claim, but x blocks of litecoin has more security than x/4 blocks of bitcoin, assuming equal hashing power due to [gambler's ruin](
As an example imagine an attacker without 51% of the network, eventually if they are mining a offline chain they will be surpassed, their goal is to mine a chain that gets ahead and double spend before the rest of the network catches up.
Now imagine a made up 1day-coin with blocktimes of 1 day, versus litecoin of 2.5 minutes (just to show an extreme example) An attacker with less than 51% of the network has a even chance of mining this 1day-coin based on its hashrate, and a slim chance of mining 2-3 blocks in a row (depending on their hash rate)
But for a similar attack on litecoin to last a day the attacker would have to offline mine 576 blocks in a row faster than the rest of the network which is much harder to do due to stats/gamblers ruin when you don't have 51% of the network. 
Basically as difficulty is lowered due to shorter block times, the chances of an attacker with less than 51% of the hashing power to be able to mine an offline chain of the same equivalence in minutes drops.
If you're still reading [this might explain it more clearly](
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:59:39
There's a middle ground, it doesnt have to be the main factor difficulty is based off of, but it could be scaled in relation to difficulty. Maybe log scale to address your concerns.

If its in the block chain, then the only way to double spend it is to fork the block chain before the block that has that specific transaction. 
Basically you cant try to spend coins that have already been spent and are in the block chain.

To correct a minor point:
The first bitcoin mined was not the genesis block, it was created. There is nothing to chain it to so the previous block is all 0's.
Also the reason for the 6 day lag between the genesis block and the first block is satoshi didn't start mining until he announced it publically. With all the pre-mine scams going on, that is slightly interesting. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 15:54:54
You're right, especially since the main bitcoin app doesnt have any in-app password protection, though another app "shouldn't" have access to that information.
To get a scale of what they could do: There are a [billion]( android devices out there as of last year, probably a hundred million more or so by now. If every one did 350 KH/sec [which I randomly pulled from here]( that works out to 350,000 * 1,000,000,000 = 350,000 GH/sec
350,000 GH/sec gives you a monthly profit of $353,000 	today.
(that is an optimistic number, the billion android devices out there cant all average 350kh/s, along with the impossibility of successfully mining on 100% of them)

It is easy to think you're superior to others, it is much harder to back up your case with a logical refutation which includes references to back up your conclusions. 
Every point with you becomes redirected, I guess in an attempt to maintain your correctness. Now we're on the topic of a race condition. 
My point is if two transactions (with the same input) are broadcast before either is included in a block, it is unknown which one will be included in the next block. You seem to be talking about a race condition inside a single node's memory pool, which doesnt happen as I've said, but that's not what we were talking about. You're original proposal of creating two tx's offline and broadcasting them remains broken in some cases.

If you look at what you are buying when purchasing bitcoins vs torcoins. Bitcoin miners bought hardware and used power to support the bitcoin network, great. Torcoin miners bought hardware and used (less) power but more bandwidth to support the largest global anti-censorship network in existence. That is more admirable in my opinion. 
This doesn't mean it will take off, I agree it is closer to curecoin/primecoin that try to do something useful with the hashrate. Hopefully more people start a Tor relay, which is all that matters

Tor avoids building circuits with nodes in close proximity, meaning you'll nearly always build a circuit where each node is in a different class B (and probably class A). This results in a high probability of your inter-node communication reaching major backbones/under sea cables. 
The NSA taps these points 


The additional resources required to run a few thousand Tor nodes is not much for the NSA, but it wouldn't net them more than 50% of the Tor traffic and could tip people off to what they are doing. They would be pretty dumb to launch a bunch of Tor nodes instead of just monitoring the vast majority of the traffic via their other tapping programs

You're a little hostile there without saying much besides "also bullshit"




It **IS** based on how many nodes you are connected to. As a bitcoin node you receive and relay transactions. When someone sends a transaction with a destination of the brainwallet's hashed public key, you want to receive this transaction before other nodes that may also be looking for this (optimally from the original sender). This will give you a slight time advantage to create and broadcast a new transaction which moves these coins to your hashed public key (address).




Who are you even arguing against, the original point or me? Because they are opposite. I was arguing against the original point that you do not require a 10MB/s connection to be connected to a hundred nodes or so and receive new blocks and relay transactions. [Here's my proof]( I await yours... (or at least a coherent statement)






Scrape is the wrong term, but as you receive txs from other nodes you have to do a lookup in your key pair table. Assuming you have multiple cores or CPUs this can be sped up (assuming you dont mess up I/O) by multithreading. But again I was spit-balling and basically arguing against the original author. Multithreading is probably not a huge concern.

I disagree. Ads on the internet were turning into [idiocracy level]( annoyance. And many sites displaying ads were not content producers that deserve as much sympathy / money. 
So when ads were getting way to annoying people started blocking them. But the key is adblock plus allows a way for content producers to still advertise. They currently allow ads on small sites, or if they are unobtrusive. That is the better way to handle things in my opinion. 
Block annoying shitty ads, make content producers realize that if they want a larger population of their customers to view ads, they need to make them less annoying. Everyone wins

Actually depending on the attack vector you're most concerned about, running a relay on the same box as a hidden service can be a good idea.
Imagine you run a popular hidden service that is not running a tor relay, it would be pretty obvious to see that your computer is connecting to a ton of tor relays constantly 24/7. And all of the traffic you're sending/receiving is to/from that hidden service (for timing analysis attacks that work well on low traffic HSs).
However if your HS is also a relay, then there is a ton of other tor traffic going through your computer, and it is obvious to everyone else that your node is a tor relay. So now the HS tor traffic is more like a needle in a needle stack of all the other tor packets going to and from your computer.

Cool, so as I understand it the previous nlocktime issues were 1. that txs weren't included in blocks until the locktime expired. 2. That the sender could doublespend a transaction with uint_max and prevent the receiver of the first transaction from getting their coins.
I browsed the BIP but maybe i'm a little slow, would checklocktimeverify tx's enter the blockchain right away?
Most of the examples in the BIP show tx's with two options (goes to sender now to claim, or is returned in the future for example), can you instead just create a transaction that is only spendable in the future?
How far in the future can you set the locktime? 300 years? Could people use this feature to destroy coins by setting this to thousands of years? (not that i have a usecase for it, just curious)

They're similar. An offline wallet means one that resides on a computer that is not connected to the internet. It is usually much harder to bridge an "air gap" for malware or anyone else attempting to steal your bitcoins by using an offline wallet. 
A paper wallet takes it a step further and after initial generation (assuming it is deleted securely), the private keys only reside on paper (not on any computer). If done correctly an attacker would literally have to see or film that piece of paper to steal the coins. 
Paper wallets can be brought back to an "offline" state by importing them into a client running on a computer that is offline. The cool thing about doing it this way is you can create and sign transactions with the private key never being on a machine connected to the internet.
For an intro see the slide deck on this site, they also make a nice client that supports these features

Right but at the time of that block it had a difficulty of 37 million which is just over 1% of where the difficulty is today.
In theory couldn't someone mine from that block until the next block retarget and force the difficulty down. Allowing them to pretty quickly mine from that point, and perform a similar attack?
If it is the chain with the highest difficulty (that meets the retarget requirements) then this attack wouldn't work.

Let me know if I have this right, I think the thought process is...
If miners can more easily decide which transactions to include in blocks, then they can accept additional fees from bitpay/coinbase/whatever.
Those pools can now offer an additional incentive to individual miners ("make +3% at my pool"). Potentially resulting in more people moving to the pool that can negotiate the highest fees, and pass the rewards on to the users.
Peter's patch was for all miners and it doesnt rely on outside negotiations. it provides all users the same amount of higher fees

It is unrelated to the difficulty, for the first 210k blocks the reward was 50 bitcoin, now it is 25. It continues to half, around every 4 years. 
When the reward halves is based on the block number, and since on average we are mining a block slightly faster than ever 10 minutes due to my last post, it halves about every 3 years and 8-11 months.

after 1 confirmation, no. you have to mine two blocks from the previous block before the next block.
after 0 confirmations, still no basically. The default client stores the first transaction it receives in its mempool. unless you carefully time transactions by sending them to nodes on opposite sides of the world, most miners will all see the same (first) transaction, and include that in the next block.  
There are modified clients that accept the highest fee transaction, in that case it is trivial to doublespend, but you have to bank on those miners succeeding and mining the next block.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:28:40
So you're saying if 90% of people were running the client supporting the larger blocks, then miners could start using them at that point?
I think they do that for block versions, where both are supported until X% are seen with the newer version, then only the newer version is supported (or similar). To measure that they look at the blocks though, not the users. I think that is the difference here.
A large percentage of miners could all update within a week, and start spitting out large blocks. But if all the clients don't support the larger blocks you get a fork and related bad things.

My corrected statement was "When someone sends a transaction with a destination of the brainwallet's hashed public key", and you replied


Which kind of shows the "moving the goal posts", no one said you send anything to a public key, you send it to a hashed public key. However your statement is correct, moving on...


For someone that is seemingly worried about using incorrect terminology and a disdain for the "best buy" crowd (which I share), you should be ashamed of this quote. This is hypocrisy on your part after demanding technically correct statements. The bitcoin address doesn't enable the receiver to claim that balance, the script is the key part that allows someone to create a new tx with input from the old tx. Usually the script says you have to sign any txs using inputs from the old tx, but it can say other crazy things. It can say anyone can spend this, or find me a x such that sha256(sha256(x))= some number in the script. [This was done here](
The fact remains a bitcoin address IS a (double) hashed public key (plus a net ID and CRC) which I referenced [here]( you can check the image which graphically overviews how a bitcoin address is created. But someone so "familiar with what I have been linking" should know all of this.
Your response to an address being a hashed public key is 


Again you apparently disagree about how a bitcoin address is created, or maybe you just choose to not address your dumbed-down/elementary statements you so viciously accuse me of using. And again I try to explain, however your responses become more obtuse.  
**&lt;end bitcoin address discussion&gt;**
**&lt;start core argument discussion&gt;**
Back to the core argument you suggest (but I worry by creating two different topics in one post you will only choose to respond to one directly, putting more effort into the only one you feel you are correct in.)


There is, or rather can be by a malicious individual (of course if everyone plays by the rules there is never much of a problem).
I cover a few ways this can happen ( isn't likely to work in this scenario but  and  are)
 [peter todd's fee-based double spend](
You create your two offline TXs and broadcast them using the new lower fee. We can even say they are sent to every node at the same exact time if you want (not technically possible obviously)
lets say at this moment, shortly after a 0.9 release of bitcoin that lowered the fee, 70% of the miners (based on hashing power) are using the old version. This older version requires a higher fee for txs to enter their mem pool.
This means your two transactions enter the mem pool of 30% of the mining nodes (based on hash power). But 70% of the nodes see your transaction and reject it because the fee is too low based on tx size. If nothing else is done, they will be mined as you expect.
But then some jerk comes along and is running a node that sees both of your transactions before a block is mined. He also has the same private key. So he creates a double-spend tx with the same inputs from your second transaction. However he changes the fee to be high enough for all (or nearly all) mining nodes to accept into their memory pool.
At this point no transactions have entered a block. 100% of the nodes may have seen your second transaction first, but only 30% let it enter into their memory pool. 
My double-spent transaction (of your second tx) was also potentially seen by 100% of the nodes, but 30% of them rejected it because they already have your tx in their memory pool. They dont "bump out" the tx by default (both in agreement there). But the other 70% of the nodes, the ones that rejected your second tx have my second tx in their memory pool. 
Now it is a race condition who mines which first.
Admittedly most of the 70% of the miners discussed above wont accept your first low fee transaction, so my second double spend wont have a valid input, so your transaction should be OK here. The only way I can see this working is if your first tx is mined in a block without your second tx, this is possible but not likely. But this example will be used in the below points. 
 A percentage of miners may run modified clients that adjust the txs they accept into their mem pool. There is a POC [here](
In the above example these miners see the second double-spend transaction with a higher fee than the first, and they do "bump out" the older transaction. They of course have to mine a block before the rest of the network, but given services [exist]( to do this, and there is incentive to mine with this mem pool algorithm (collect more fees) it may start happening more often. Especially as coinbase reward drops and the fee becomes a larger percentage of the total reward for mining a block. 
 Beating your txs across the network, same concept as [high frequency trading](
You create your two offline txs and broadcast them. However there are thousands of nodes, and multiple nodes have to retransmit your txs before they reach every node's mem pool (technically we only care about the miners mem pool)
As an attacker I could be connected directly to you, or a small number of hops away if i ran a well connected node. Blockchain.info shows how many nodes they are connected to at the bottom, normally it is at least hundreds, but NATed users only connect to &lt;8 nodes.
So you send these txs out say to 8 people. ~5ms later those 8 people probably have your txs in their memory pool. For this example one of those people is the attacker (me). 
At this point I again have the same private key, and I'm working on creating a double-spend tx. I of course I dont relay your second tx, but I can relay your first at this point. 
Say it takes me 70ms to create this tx. (I have nothing to estimate this, if you have a better number I'm interested). 
The critical piece is bitcoin (at least used to) [sleep 100ms]( before relaying a transaction to the next node. 
So your txs don't reach beyond those 7 nodes until: 5ms(initial tx time) + 100ms (sleep) + 5ms (broadcast time from first hop to second) = 110ms.
Meanwhile I saw your txs at 5ms, worked on a double-spend tx for 70ms, and sent out my version of the second tx which reached nodes 5ms later = 80ms total.
Meaning my second tx may be seen, and therefore enter more mining nodes memory pool before yours does. (I also broadcasted the same initial tx).
If the successful mining node put my second tx in the block they mine I win.
There are probably other ways, but as you can see it is a race condition in every sense of the word. I have to get my tx into mining nodes mem pool before yours does. 
I'm sure you can find a few places where I use the wrong term in a post of this size, feel free to do so. But I'd rather see a refute of the core argument.

Of course we do, the example I posted said he was trolling everyone. It is pretty trivial to tell when they are unable to produce any details or proof. Even their stories sound incredibly similar, just with details changed. This isn't solving a murder, it is just picking out the trolls. 


I wasn't attacking them. I was suggesting we don't support their trolling.


These trolls aren't coming up with mind blowing new attacks that require the community involvement to attempt to solve. They are boring tug-at-your-heart-string fake stories. Did you not know that keeping valuables in a small safe that is not bolted down is a bad idea?


When the people donating honestly believe the trolls story that is a problem. It is similar in my mind to someone setting up a fake charity site and attempting to solicit donations from people that think the money is going somewhere else. But I care more about having trolls ruin the sub, than others throwing away their money.

From the first link's presentation: "with manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of tor users, however no success de-anonymizing a user in response to a TOPI request/on demand"
Second link: Yes tor takes money from the gov, they make [no attempt to hide it]( and release their financials every year. If you've ever found a technical problem or bug in the software and attempted to get it fixed by donating time/money you'd find everyone that runs it very open to criticism. It also talks about how snowden ran an exit node and cared about privacy, he also used truecrypt, and pgp crypto when talking to journalists. I think this shows what tools work, and which the [NSA can't break]( 
third link: "Now, Tor itself has never been compromised: It remains secure and anonymous." ... it goes on to say "But to get to Tor, you have to use a Tor node, and to get to a Tor node, you must send info from your IP address to the node’s address. And even before that, you’ve got to download the list of Tor exit and entry nodes from the central authority." All not true using [bridges]( plus if it remains anonymous who cares? I don't get the point of this article.
fourth link: The first attack they mention has been [found and fixed]( the second just mentions some attacking relays were setup and banned shortly after. They say 


To suggest that people should start using less tested tools with a smaller number of developers, and a smaller network just because a bug was found and fixed, is a terrible idea 
fifth link: Same presentation as the first link, also focuses on a firefox bug not a Tor bug
sixth link: this is just an overview of tor, did you even read this?
seventh link: Again, another introductory article on Tor that also goes against your point by saying


eighth link: It just says what the third link says, that the NSA is recording a list of people who download tor directly, not that Tor is being attacked or broken.

Kinda like "HD radio"


@_date: 2015-01-12 01:47:27
Source? Do you have any proof at all of a larger number of relays run by the gov? 
It wouldn't make sense for the NSA to run a ton of exit nodes. Think about it for a second. If the NSA runs even 50% of the exit nodes (which wouldn't be practical) then they're only able to associate a small percentage of exit traffic to first-hop relay traffic. Plus it would be easy to notice what they're doing.
Instead the NSA would use XKEYSCORE and other spying programs to tap the internet backbones where they can acquire the vast majority of all Tor traffic. This is because to avoid hopping between 3 relays within the same legal jurisdiction, Tor avoids using a circuit with two IPs in the same class A (or B I forget which).
All near-real-time anonymity systems have this traffic correlation problem. If you're a relay and you have to send packets out about as quickly as you get them they can be correlated to some degree. Instead if you collect 1000 packets, then send out 1000 packets it is much harder but adds latency.

All true, but the average block size isn't what matters so much. If any one block fills up (which has happened many times) that can be seen as a negative, because transactions would now take longer to be confirmed.

He literally did come out and say he liked bitcoin... that's the point of this post.
I didn't realize I needed to take the "bitcoin wastes electricity" arguement seriously here. Usually it is only repeated by c-suite execs trying to sound smart during CNBC interviews. I figured we're more intelligent than that and understand the purpose and benefits of mining.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:32:24
A block is created on average every 10 minutes, so the minimum needed just to keep up is 8mb*8bits/byte / 600 seconds = 0.1066 megabits / second. VS 1/8th that.
But that's not the whole story, if you're mining you can really only start building off a previous block once you download it (excluding some of the header-only distribution methods).  
So if it takes you 2 minutes to download a block, you have 10-2=8 minutes to mine, vs someone who can download a block in 1 minute which has 9 minutes to mine.
TLDR; If you're just trying to keep up with the block chain, you don't need a fast connection (~512kbps should do close to 4x the rate), but if you want to mine you need the fastest possible connection you can get a hold of.

I think he's referring to coinbase claiming they consider 'bitcoin' to be the chain with the most hashrate. Considering the majority of miners [are signaling]( support for segwit2x, if they follow through coinbase's trading of 'bitcoin' would be on the segwit2x chain

Only if you have a slow connection. Most cable/fiber companies offer 25mbps service for a rate most can afford.
an 8mb block * 8 = 64mbits / 25mbps = 2.56 seconds to download a block. Sure there's overhead but you're still able to pull a block down in a small number of seconds so it doesn't really matter.
The people arguing for smaller blocks have to use 1mbps or 512kbps dsl speeds to make their case.

As an example my old laptop can generate thousands of valid bitcoin [minikey addresses]( per second that only contain lower case characters and numbers. I realize this isn't exactly the same, and the checksum would raise the time needed to generate addresses.

But the time it takes to go online and download that javascript allows a VERY slight potential for infection. (again very very slight, but we're talking in paranoid terms here)
Generating them purely offline removes whatever small attack vector is possible by going online.
The counter to this is to load the webpage on a USB stick, and run it in a browser off a live CD, which would be the same risk as armory I think. Assuming you verified the javascript like you can with armory's distribution
@_date: 2012-09-05 02:01:07
yep armory is the same way, but i don't think it lets you pick the deterministic phrase. I wonder about the crypto implications of specifying your own seed since I'm guessing it isn't very random at that point. 
I'm just not sure I'm sold on relying on a external server (even though I can run it myself). But at that point just run the all-in-one normal client. It makes sense for cellphones and smaller devices for sure though.
@_date: 2012-09-05 01:14:21
You dont need the block chain unless you are signing transactions, to make a paper wallet you never have to connect your computer to the inet.
I'll admit I dont know anything about electrum but I doubt it has the same features as armory as it relates to making paper wallets.
@_date: 2012-09-05 02:09:42
Yeah they both look very similar as it relates to offline wallets. Though the wiki shows the CLI interface, I'm not sure how well supported it is via a GUI. Armory works directly with ubuntu cd's, they even package up all the dependencies which is nice. Armory doesnt support the external blockchain that i know of. 
@_date: 2012-04-19 19:09:38
Yeah i think namecoin should have had an inverse slope to how they distribute namecoins, maybe even bitcoin should have. So early adopters still get "enough" coins since the hash rate is low but as more people join you're more likely to still get a similar amount of namecoins as you did previously.
Right now it seems like it is just for cyber squatters registering everything ahead of time, which causes it to be more and more useless if there isn't a means to prevent that.

Yes I do and I dont download it on the machine i'm generating the keys on. I was more pointing to the fact that if you are online with the computer you are generating the keys on, there are other potential exploits outside of the software you are trying to download. 
There could be another machine on your same subnet that is infected and infects your machine while you downloaded the javascript. Though thinking about this more I guess if you are never online again after that fact, and have no persistent memory, then their only attack would be against the javascript itself. Hmm

Most bitcoin implementations consider a transaction fully confirmed when 6 blocks are built on top of the block that the transaction occurs in.
Worse than simply getting lucky and mining 6 blocks in a row is a single entity that controls 51% of the hashrate. But this has happened to [bitcoin before]( so acting like BCH has this unique issue isn't correct either
You can read more about why 6 was chosen in the [bitcoin paper]( (start around page 7)  
Or see here: 
Edit: Bitcoin has had 6 or more be mined in a row by one pool also [1]( and [2]( The difference is BTC moved away from centralization, where BCH seems to be attracted to it (in terms of mining at least)

I wouldn't bet anyone that my android phone doesnt have a virus on it for a few hundred dollars.
But if you download a live cd, verify the iso, burn it to a read only medium, boot off the cd on a computer that can have all other storage media disconnected and the internet disconnected, you can make it physically impossible for someone to steal your keys since all data is lost once you shut down.

Since some of these forks and airdrops aren't as well established, here are some other tips:  
(none of these steps should be followed alone, but each one should help raise your confidence in being the correct link, at least its better than not doing them)
WARNING: I link to scammer's usernames in this post (but not their site), don't click anything off other comments I link to (but you shouldn't trust me in the first place people)
1. Twitter, reddit, and social media accounts are too easy to replicate, instead the bitcointalk anouncement thread "should" be much harder to fake when there's dozens of pages of comments. Example search "site:bitcointalk.org bitcoin private [ann]" to find the announcement thread for bitcoin private. 
2. Most of these social media scammers don't put a lot of effort into their accounts, they're a few months old, and 50% or more of their posts include the same link. (like this scammer's did). Interestingly this scammer also [replied]( to another co-scammer when he posted the same link. Without clicking their usernames you'd just think two different people agreed it is a legit site. But when you look at their profile pages it becomes obvious. This makes it easy to find their other accounts (two accounts were created a day apart, but none were very old)  
example: (and maybe and what the op found from 3. What I think looks like the real site ( has links to github, a warning about scam sites (though some fakes sites even have that), and [SHA256 sums]( of their releases.  
Searching for the hash of the latest release links together the bitcointalk announcement and that site (though the links i guess previously did too)  
And verify the hash, which you should be doing anyway. Hopefully the signature too if there is one
Again none of these are super hard to fake, i think clicking on reddit names and seeing what else they post in, how much effort seems to go into their posts, if they post the same link over and over are pretty clear indicators now. But it is "mostly" easy to detect them as of today if you follow steps like this. Web of trust PGP signatures are the real way to cryptographically solve this
is a good place to check out if you want to do this frequently.  
Edit: there are advanced guides on how to use 2 electrum installs (only giving the private key to the offline VM) that would've stopped this even if you installed the malicious code

If you have any important amount of money, you should generate the offline keys... offline! (and not trust any other websites or applications that could communicate to the internet).

I realize the addresses are generated client side, but I still cant recommend doing anything "online" while creating a paper backup.
The armory doesnt need to sync the block chain or anything crazy. And you should already be booted off a live CD even when using bitaddress.org so I dont think it is that much more work

Philosophically speaking, they shouldn't be required to follow those overbearing financial KYC laws. Practically speaking, they should operate in a jurisdiction that has more favorable financial privacy laws.
But because that's not possible in this case, when something does occur the funds should be controlled by the government if a law was broken. Hopefully that occurs in this situation, then the op can just deal with the government instead of the exchange.
That would also prevent the exchange from falsely claiming "its not our fault, we're required to lock your account. Oh and also we can't provide details or steps to resolve the situation. Our hands are tied, deal with it"

To start: 1mb block size regardless of fees (same as today)  
If there are fees over 500sat/byte that fill 200kb, another 200kb can be added for a total of 1.2mb  
If there are fees over 1000sat/byte that fill 400kb another 400kb can be added for a total of 1.6mb

Wont work for cable companies. He asked "why not have 10 cable companies" in a city. 
The reason is it is not easy enough to switch the coax going to your house, and route it to a different location. And nearly all available frequencies usable over longer lengths of cable are already used by the one provider, so two companies cant share a line simultaneously. 
The other reason why there aren't 2+ cable companies that pass the same house, is it doesn't make financial sense to be the second cable company in a region. With one cable company they can estimate X% of customers will take their service. The second cable company can only hope to achieve something less than that since the pool of cable customers will be split.

Thanks I get what you're saying, I also don't know the correct answer. 
My theory is you would want to generate the full 256 bits of entropy to generate an even distribution across all possible addresses. 
Said another way: if you only used 2^160 private keys, then there would be certain addresses you would never be able to generate (maybe). This would slightly constrict the total keyspace that would be required for an attacker to search over.

Why would you have to show ID to local bitcoin vendors, or were you not transacting with cash face to face?
@_date: 2011-12-19 16:05:33
Right that is part of my point though i didnt cover that. Since they are immediately dumping the bitcoins back in the market they would cause the price to fall. 
The counter arguement is since there would be more businesses accepting them, there would be more clients wanting to buy bitcoins, so again I'm not an economist but this seems like an important point. And it is a distinction between bitcoin and traditional currencies.

Honestly I don't think an increase of commerce will help the bitcoin price until those businesses accepting bitcoin choose to hold that currency.

It looks like they are doing this so that a forked namecoin block chain will support merged mining (if your card does 100MH/s for bitcoin, you can also get 100MH/s free with namecoin). But to support this it requires a change to the current block chain.
Actually they are trying to make namecoin stronger since after this they will have the combined power of all bitcoin miners also mining namecoin.
@_date: 2015-09-11 17:37:23


Why not? What if bitcoin allowed background transactions that happened automatically that bucketed up multiple inputs into one output (both in and out to the same address)
Transactions would only be sent once inputs have sat around for a sufficient timeframe to not need a fee, and could be hidden from the user.

@_date: 2011-11-29 03:19:10
Ah that makes sense. Because new blocks contained the transactions for that 10 minute window between the last block, every new block is built on my old transaction. So there must have been 20k new blocks since that transaction. 
This seems to check out: 5 months * 30 days * 24 hours / 10 minutes per block = 21600.

@_date: 2011-10-10 13:57:53
I didn't see much to back up the expected price increase. If we were dealing with a fixed number of bitcoins then yes I might tend to agree. 
But with 216,000 new bitcoins mined every 30 days at $4 a piece = $864,000 worth of new bitcoins that are mined (or think of it as printed) every month. Combine that with a small market to begin with and that is a big deal. in 2013 the amount generated will be cut in half so that is when you could expect the price to jump. (Or a few months before due to speculation)

It is pretty easy to guess especially if there is a password policy
"one capital character and one number"... hmm capatalize the first character and add a 1 and you just guessed 80% of the passwords. not only that but they ended up lowering the entropy of the password (we know the first character is a cap and the last is a 1 or number)
People are always shocked when i type my pass, a 25+ character password has more entropy than a 8-10ish (dont feel like doing the math) character password, even though i mostly use all lowercase characters.

Looking at their current prices 9.23 bitcoins for 1oz of silver.
9.23*4.01(usd/btc) = $37.01 usd per oz of silver
and the current silver spot price us 29.3 meaning you would be paying 126% (or 26% loss)
I'm not sure how they calculate their prices though.  fees are clear, they take the 24hour low of btc and the 24hr high of silver + 5% and that is your price.

Story time:
I had a BOA checking account over 10 years ago. I was moving and closed the account, the statement said  


The mistake I made was forgetting to unlink a paypal account, I made two small ebay purchases for something like $7 and $12. I noticed my mistake and figured "oh well those charges will get denied and I'll resend payment"... nope.
Instead BOA accepted the charges on a closed account and charged me $30 overdraft per transaction. I went in and complained, they said that there's no way to fully close an account. I asked what if someone steals my account number years from now and makes charges? They said they would accept the charges and charge me an overdraft fee. 
Not having time to deal with their bullshit at the time, I ended up paying half of the fees. Back then I didn't have a real job or much money, they would've done much better in the long run not pissing me off. But they lost a customer for life in me because of that.

It would add some size, but only to the mempool. The tx size once added to a block would remain the same as today.
You would probably want to allow the user to specify how long they want the tx to be valid for (and optionally allow infinite like today?), so if they are using locked transactions the tx doesn't become invalid before the locktime

That's factually not true, but how are you measuring it? Looking at the top currencies on coinmarketcap and their YTD USD values:
BTC: 13844 -&gt; 3506 = 25.3% of jan1 value  
XRP: 2.26 -&gt; 0.30 = 13.2% of jan1 value  
ETH: 765 -&gt; 94 = 12.2% of jan1 value  
XLM: 0.44 -&gt; 0.11 = 25% of jan1 value  
BCH: 2497 -&gt; 95 = 3.8% of jan1 value  
EOS: 8.85 -&gt; 1.98 = 22.4% of jan1 value  
LTC: 229 -&gt; 24.72 = 10.8% of jan1 value
Or you can look back to [2013]( and still BTC does very well compared to other coins

I think you are discussing the finney attack not a 51% attack. A 51% attack allows someone to just create their own longer block chain and have control of the network from when the attack started pretty much.
A finney attack lets an attacker mine blocks with transactions that might reverse previous transactions. However if you only have 40% of the hash rate, the attacker has a 40% chance of being able to reverse 1 confirmation transactions. They have 40%*40%=16% of reversing 2 confirmations transactions
So a 10 confirmation transaction would only have a likelihood of 40%^10 = .01% chance of happening.

So... even though you can sign and broadcast transactions from offline wallets it is kinda a pain, instead it probably makes the most sense to store paper wallets in values of 2x or so. Meaning if you have 75 bitcoins make a paperwallet with 5 , 10, 20, and 40 coins. So that in the event  you wanted to buy something with bitcoins you can just transfer the entire paper wallet of whatever value you need to your online wallet and throw away that wallet. (if you want to pay for something with 18 coins, use your wallet containing 20 coins for example)
Also keep multiple copies of the paper wallet, in case of fire or something. But remember anyone with any of the paper copies can dump the wallet. So each paper wallet is just as important.

One use for litecoin is mining on GPUs. Mining bitcoin on GPUs is unprofitable assuming you pay for power, but when mining litecoin with GPUs you'll make 600%+, then you can trade it for bitcoin or sit on it.
The other difference is when the block reward halfs. Litecoin started in 2011 so in around 2 years the block reward will half. This also drops inflation to under 10% (just as it did with bitcoin), and is (in my opinion) one of the reasons why bitcoin started to spike late last year.

I think the main question is do the airlines get to choose to use TSA security or not.
Prior to 911 they had their own security they privately paid for, and it was a contractual relationship between you and the airline if you wanted to go through their security or not.  
Theoretically an airline could choose to not have any security
Now however the government mandates all airlines and air passengers go through TSA to travel. 
So someone could say you don't have a right to fly, but you also don't have a right to drive or ride a bike or maybe even walk somewhere.  
TSA viper teams already are searching people on trains and at some larger public events.

I'm all for valid arguments against litecoin, but I didnt see many here. The main mistake he makes in his core argument is that one has to win over the other. I dont see that happening, and if it does, I dont know many/any people that would bet on litecoin over bitcoin.
1. Yes obviously the smaller chain has less people/power mining. The only way litecoin could be more secure against double spending is if more people were mining it than bitcoin (at a faster rate), and at that point bitcoin would be  and we wouldn't have this discussion. (technically litecoin becomes more secure at slightly less hashrate, explained in 
2. The "hundred of times longer" was addressed in  Litecoin today remains more secure than bitcoin at the 2.5 minute mark to the 10 minute mark (assuming expected block generation). And actually litecoin does become more secure than bitcoin assuming equal hash power due to [gamblers ruin]( The less number of nodes shouldn't factor into double spending too much. In fact the opposite argument could be made, with less nodes a transaction will propagate across all nodes faster, making double spending more difficult. In reality all that needs to be done for BTC or LTC is detection of double spends in the transaction memory pool, then the number of nodes matters less (this has been proposed)
3. no argument
4. no argument
5. no argument, to strengthen this, the one LTC wallet holding over 2 million coins is a better argument that LTC can still be held by a few (just like BTC was at this point probably).
6. no argument on diversification. Instead I see people mining litecoin due to their gpu rigs becoming obsolete mining BTC. This doesnt make litecoin suddenly a valid  currency, but if people are mining, difficulty goes up, and if people start using it this helps drive the price up, which drives adoption, goto 10.
I dont buy the "more orphans" argument, sure it happens, but that also happens in a evenly distributed way so the mining of it has this "built in cost" for all miners. Orphans also dont hit 25% of all blocks so I don't see how mining costs 4x more. Difficulty is just 4x less than it would be. 
Back to my core point, "LTC and BTC cannot coexist together" is false, look at any other currency system, and then an alternative that also exists in the market. (I hesitate to use the gold/silver argument because I don't buy that as it relates to litecoin's marketing).

@_date: 2013-11-29 22:53:42
Right, but it also isn't the end of the world since assuming this happened the transactions that weren't picked up in that block would just get pushed until the next block.
Notice how the block after the one the op links to was under 300kb. Also one block may come close to 1mb just because it may take longer than 10 minutes to find that block leading to more time for transactions to be attempted.
The true problem exists when the majority of the blocks are approaching 1mb

Your wallet should be encrypted if it is in a digital form, and you can also encrypt your paper wallet if you're super serious about it (run the private key through a block cipher with a pass-phrase you give it)
So the question about truecrypt doesnt really apply directly. If you have a digital copy of your wallet it should be encrypted. I havent looked into it, but I doubt truecrypt gives you much more cryptographic security over the built in encryption used in the official bitcoin client. No other files need to be encrypted besides the wallet either. So I dont see any benefit of using truecrypt. (besides maybe hiding your public keys?)
You touched on one attack vector, keyloggers, which could be on your system and you might not have any idea (especially if rootkit'd). An attacker could somewhat easily copy your encrypted wallet file (truecrypt or default client encryption) and sit on the file until you entered the passphrase with the keyboard. The problem here is you are online during times when an attacker could possibly copy the wallet and read your keystrokes.
But even forgetting keyloggers for a second, and pretending only you know your password... Keeping a digital copy (no matter how it is encrypted) on a computer that is online opens up the possibility of it being copied to another machine that you dont control. And that attacker can bruteforce your password. Sure maybe you have a long password, but maybe they have a [a giant ass network]( of computers cracking passwords.
So look at who can possibly attack your wallet and steal your coins. With a printed out wallet all you have to deal with is physical security. Lock that shit up in a safe deposit box or a safe and you probably have to never worry about it again. On the other hand if you encrypt it and keep it digitally and someone else *anywhere on the internet* gets their hands on it, and decides you are important enough to crack it, they just might be able to. 
also even with the default client you dont need to sync your wallet to receive coins, if all you're doing is generating a wallet file using an off network ubuntu CD, then you're probably fine. But only use that wallet file in the future using an ubuntu live CD while offline to keep the same security
edit One other benefit over digital copies, is paper is less likely to go bad. CD-R's have a memory life of something like 10 years, I wouldn't be surprised if USB sticks were worse.
@_date: 2013-09-05 02:57:49
I think the fix here is with the RPC password used for remote access to your client (this is not on by default). That password is what is brute-forcable and what is fixed.
Your actual wallet encryption password is also needed either locally or after you connect via RPC to steal coins. So if someone stole your laptop the RPC password doesnt come into play because they already have access to the wallet.dat file and they just need to get the passphrase that decrypts the wallet (not dependent on client version)

Interesting, can you help me understand this better? So in that case, you send two transactions. One never gets confirmed. But before there are any confirmations on either transaction the site determines if you won or not. 
1. In the case your bet that is confirmed wins: you get your initial bet back and winnings. All transactions are confirmed
2. In the case your bet that is not confirmed wins: the site sends your initial bet back to you (that is never confirmed, basically those coins never left your wallet) but the additional winnings are confirmed right?
So at the end of the day in both cases win right? I don't see how before any blocks are confirmed, that they can mandate that the transaction containing the winnings is only confirmed if the initial transaction is confirmed. Wouldn't you have to wait for confirmations before being able to tell?
(Ah thinking through this more) Is their transaction back to you if you win, never confirmed if it also has an input that is invalid because that input was double spent? No matter what other inputs/outputs exist on the same transaction?

Assuming "bad" nodes are able to detect and propagate their block faster than the "good" node, what if pools worked equally on blocks discovered within the initial ~5 seconds of learning of a block?
That way even if bad nodes could get their block out there first, they would still have a 50/50 chance (or worse) since miners are splitting their computational power on each block that they learned about. 
This has the downside that attackers can almost always get their block worked on half the time, so this would only help if my initial assumption is true.
@_date: 2013-10-01 01:45:33
But if difficulty is higher, and assuming for this example that everyone has equally efficient miners, then the cost to mine those same amount of bitcoins goes up. If the cost goes up, people that mined the bitcoins will not sell it for less than what it costs them to mine.

There are other ways, the key derivation function is most of the problem. Since it is basically a single sha256 from the passphrase, attackers can generate billions of brainwallets a second.
Instead if you hash something with scrypt that would take 15 minutes on a CPU, along with a non shitty password, you're much less likely to get your coins taken. And attackers will only be able to generate 10's to 100's of thousands of wallets a second. And who cares if it takes you 15 minutes to access a cold wallet.

Not quite if you can double spend and you have a 50% chance of winning here would be the odds. (think truth table)
* 25% chance both bets win, you would only get paid once probably due to the payback method tigereyeTO mentions
* 50% chance one of the bets wins and one loses, you would get paid once
* 25% chance both lose, you dont get paid
This results in you getting paid 75% of the time on a bet that nearly doubles your money. So there is a negative house edge and you would win a large amount of money over the long run.

Thanks, that makes sense
As for your second paragraph bitcoins seem to be specific in the same wallet in a way, let me give you an example. You send 1 bitcoin to wallet a, 10 bitcoins to wallet a, and 100 bitcoins to wallet a.
You then try to send 10 bitcoins from wallet a. I'm pretty sure the client is smart enough to determine that to avoid breaking up the 100 bitcoins, it could instead use the 10 bitcoin block and send those directly. Otherwise it would use the 100 bitcoins as an input, and return 90 bitcoins to another one of your addresses.
The question I think we both have is what happens if instead wallet A gets 5 transactions all containing exactly 10 bitcoins. Then wallet A tries to send 10 bitcoins, is it traceable which block of 10 bitcoins is being sent?
Edit: I meant address not wallet above

Can i ask where you gathered that information?
Assuming 17k SC's will ship (maybe eventually, I'm sure at least half of those are for their smaller chip). That would be 60gh*17,000=1,020,000gh of hashing that will be introduced. Or a increase in difficulty of a factor or more than 46 times.
Again, yes not all orders are SC, but that 'back of the napkin' calculation also doesn't factor in any other companies shipping asic miners that will introduce more hashing power eventually either.

To receive coins you just need an address (and private keys to that address to spend them later)
To spend coins offline you take a online wallet with the public keys from the address you want to spend from and create a transaction. That transaction is not valid until it is signed by you private key which is offline. You then copy that transaction back to the online machine to broadcast it to the network. All of this is in the link above.

Beyond checksum bits, it gets exponentially harder to generate vanity bitcoin addresses as you specify more and more characters that you mandate in the vanity address.
If you mandated the exact key you'd have to find the exact private / public keys out of 2^160 possible addresses (so unlikely it is basically not possible)
If you mandated the exact key except for one character (and assuming they all had valid checksums, which as points out they don't) and each character position had 58 possibilities (base 58).... Then you'd have to find 1 of the 58 possible addresses / keys out of 2^160 combinations that are possible (again not likely to the point of being impossible)
two chars = 3364 total possibilities / 2^160...
It makes more sense to generate random private keys and check the balance since you're just trying to guess the keys of anyone in the world that has bitcoins in their account. This is still around 2^128 so good luck

he runs a mining pool and has a large amount of hashrate available. by merge mining it doesnt take away from his mining pool users that want bitcoins (think how you can mine namecoin and bitcoin simultaniously).
So new coins like these that are bullshit he merge mines and has over half the hashrate, he only builds off his own blocks, and his blocks always contain no transactions. So the rest of the network is basically dead, and they cant build a blockchain faster than he can.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:10:36
You shouldnt be using online services to generate offline paper wallets. Some sites allow you to load their site, unplug, then print the wallet. But there is still an attack vector there by just plugging in your machine to the internet.
If you want to do it right, verify a copy of ubuntu, burn it to a cd-r (maybe verify the cd-r on another machine), power off your machine, unplug the power and remove the hard drives, boot the ubuntu cd, install armory from a verified usb stick and follow the rest of armory's instructions.

Yes it is the best way I know of to store bitcoins offline in paper wallets (and it will ONLY be on the paper wallet after you reboot)
You do not need to sync the block chain or connect to the internet, and you can even transfer coins from the paper wallet by creating transactions and moving them to an online machine via a usb stick.
read that link and understand it, then try it with 0.00000x bitcoins at least once, making sure you reboot where you should so you better understand it. Then go on to backing up a larger amount of coins.

@_date: 2013-10-30 18:48:05
Ah right that also explains the single sha256+ripemd, but does that really apply in this instance since the length is known?
Correct me where I'm wrong. The output of H(s)=A, an attacker creates z so H(s+z) still equals A.
In bitcoin's case s = the output from the RIPEMD-160, basically your address minus the checksum.
H() = sha256() that reads blocks of 1024 ([i think?](
Let's say a single sha256 operation was used. So an attacker comes along knows s (the address - checksum which is padded to 1024 bits i think), and that sha256 was used for the checksum.
An attacker creates a new z that is 1024 bits such that sha256(s+z) and now creates the same checksum. However in doing so they've created an invalid bitcoin address since it is now 2048 bits long (length of s + length of z).
I guess the time tradeoffs for a known potential attack vector make doing a double sha256 a no brainer. But I don't see a current attack against a single sha256 checksum since the length of s is known (or rather cant be increased by 1024 bits).
Thanks for the information.

I think krillcoin isnt talking about having 51% of the computational power because that wouldn't really matter how fast the blocks are, eventually you will have a longer chain.
I think he is discussing the fact that even an attacker with 10% of the total network has a chance of mining 6 blocks faster than the rest of the network. The chances are low, but he can continuously attempt this until he is successful.

My assumption is that as more people mine and difficulty goes up, people will only sell bitcoins if they are making a profit. Yes some people have free power but generally people want to do better than break even so the average price of new coins are sold at a profit for people who pay power.
So with a massive amount of mining power coming online, and with fewer people selling at today's prices, the idea is the price would go up.
The counter argument to this is new mined coins are an extremely low percentage of all coins that exist today. Basically I can't predict the future.
