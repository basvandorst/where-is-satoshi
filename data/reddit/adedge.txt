This is really the only solution, likewise with the next "high", and I mean a high like the first time BTC rocketed up to over $1000. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 14:28:23
Bit drastic, but ok. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 10:20:27
Too late to jump into mining? For most people, yes. But thats not all bitcoin is.
The primary way to get bitcoin *now* is by buying it, ie converting local currency into cryptocurrency - which can be a pretty easy process (even as an Australian). I could get someone setup with a couple of BTC (or a fraction of one) in a few hours pretty easily, given they have the funds of course. 
So no, not only available to the rich, as I originally stated.

*Edit - Downvotes? Seriously?? For asking a legit question? Come on...
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:32:12
Ahh, getting slammed with downvotes for that :/
Did you consider contacting Tesla *with* bitcoins ready to buy? If enough people inquire and actually have the motivation/aim to buy a car with said bitcoins... they might just start to accept bitcoins - *which would be a pretty major thing*. 
I came to this thread because I thought Tesla now accept bitcoins and thats a kinda exciting thing. Hence why a lot of people are likely going to slam you with downvotes. Tis a harsh place, but thats what happens...
Congrats on the car either way though, I am jealous (really would like a Tesla oneday, or at least get to test drive one) Good to know bitcoins played a large part of the purchase.

Removing something from the system it exists within is usually pretty good way to protect it from that system. 
But an amusing quote all the same :)
@_date: 2014-01-03 10:11:21




Well, you must be the expert on these things then. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 02:51:04
That just about sums up the level of thought put into the article, yes. 
Basically - Bitcoin skyrocketed last year during these months so why not again!? Also, something about cars and tax returns. Pretty solid stuff... /sarcasm 
@_date: 2014-01-16 11:52:17
You said nothing about mining in your original comment. 
And mining is in no way 'free' bitcoins. You pay for the cpu/gpu cycles &amp; hardware and you pay for the electricity to run the hardware. Depending on your setup and local energy prices you might not even break even - until the bitcoins you mine are worth more ofc. But thats a gamble anyway. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:35:30
Is there a buy-wall or something around $530?

Yeh, na... Thats not how it works.

You can buy BTC with Doge, so all works out in the end. I guess?
@_date: 2013-04-29 05:52:10
Mother of god... Haha
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:57:53
Thanks for replying. Not sure about it executing with the current price though, the pending order specifies the price that I ordered it at. Perhaps theres a time limit on that? Before the order resets to the current price? Im not entirely sure... 
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:37:18
Bloody hell. Comments like this make me wish Id heard about bitcoins a little earlier... haha :)

Still havent brought myself to watch all of that one yet. Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg is unbearably drowning in ego and I cant stand it. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:18:21
Cheers for the information! I too was about to transfer money (but didnt) right before it plunged down to $70. Those following days were a bit painful, but we learn. 
But yeh, given the fees for an international wire, probably best to just be patient and set things up properly with a verified account. Im in no rush (you wouldnt want to be) Not to mention the bonus of being able to setup automatic bids and just sitting back and letting mtgox run the show ;)
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:44:42
Haha comment was written before my morning coffee, my bad ;)
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:11:28


It is when the banks have closed and its 16 hours until they open again, leaving you with a different market-rate than the one you bought them at initially (which knowing bitcoin and the size of the order could be a matter of hundreds of dollars) Like you said - "buy when you know you have time to get to the bank in time" - which is lame with such an already high risk and volatile market!
I just think its a bit shitty thats all, its the best option we have here in Aus atm and it doesnt allow a lot of flexibility because its only viable when banks are open. 
Otherwise we do have the option of transferring money to a Mt Gox account and sitting on it until the price reaches the level you want to buy at. Still not ideal because you have money sitting there doing nothing, and it needs to be there in advance of the market taking a fall otherwise you have a 2 day wait before your international transfer goes though.

Good to hear! Somewhere in SA plz :)
@_date: 2013-08-24 06:31:59
You shouldnt feel guilty, this is pretty cool stuff. Will likely get myself a couple when I have more BTC. Going over the website now to see how it all works and what amounts can be put onto a coin.
And anyway, how else are we meant to come across this kind of thing! Youre doing us all (and yourself) a favour
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:23:42
At least 1 in Adelaide somewhere and I'll be happy! :P

Not to mention you can 3D print with metal as well now, among other things 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:08:17
Yes true. And its probably a lot *more than 99%, could probably add a few decimal places there, 99.999% or something. 
*edit - words :/
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:33:28
That sucks :( 
I heard bits and pieces about it early on, but didnt really take any proper notice until the bubble burst yesterday and there were some headlines. 
Either way, if this crash continues it could very well be a 2nd chance for a lot of us to get in while the BTC is low. Its just a hard call to make with such an unstable.. *everything!*
@_date: 2013-05-04 04:43:11
Yeh Im thinking about how it would go here in Australia. Id probably be in the final stages of dying by now....
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:34:37
We really need some of these BTC ATMs around Australia... That would be nice!
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:38:29
Excellent. And yeh its down again. Seems to conveniently go down every time the rate drops to around/below $100. Euugggh
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:17:24
Yep, youre doing it right. 
Where/how are you setting up your buy orders? (Gox?) And will such a place work with Australian banks?
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:11:22
Forgive my ignorance, but what does this chart show exactly? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:52:18
Ahu, excellent thanks :) Guessing that was the 120,000~~,000~~ coins transferred the other day. Very interesting graph!
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:06:34
Going into the weekend should be interesting
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:41:08
Yeh certainly. Ive read about too many people making poor decisions lately within something as unstable as bitcoins. 
A handful of BTC is fine for me right now, planning on messing around with things to see what I can make of it before considering anything more major.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:52:17


Feel free to do that, Id take some ;)
But really, its just the way these things go, especially when its such a young/new market/idea and when theres major bugs to iron out. It might be months before this sorts itself out and gets anywhere close to being stable. If I were in your position Id be holding though these tough parts (as youve said youre planning to), and just hope things recover back up to 100 and beyond in the near future, just play it cool and have confidence the market will recover (IMO bitcoin is too unique and powerful to crash out completely, its only just getting started and those of us in it for the long run will most likely profit most)

As someone who spent half an hour digging a grave earlier today for an animal with its neck missing &amp; blood everywhere... Dont think I'll be worrying about bitcoins too much ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:16:20
Its fun to watch when you have money as well. Just depends on when you bought in. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:04:27
Ok, I see what your saying. 
I bought/made the order pretty low (relative to prices lately anyway), so in the event the market value falls even more, it wouldnt be too bad (could always just cancel it and make a new order if I had the funds in by then) If it did an automatic purchase once the price reached the level of the order, then that works as well.
Just more things to consider I guess. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:04:30
Interesting. Cheers for the reply
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:02:14
I attempted a bit of Bitcoin mining a few months ago, not a whole lot of luck of course since I dont have the best rig for it. How does LTC compare? Easier to mine than BTC Im assuming...
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:00:41
This is what I assumed.. but wasnt sure if there was a bit more behind it. The more you know!
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:11:17
You all knew what I meant :P
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:40:16
I imagine youll be thinking the same in a year or two when its hitting 20k. 
Why didnt I buy any when it was at $1000!?
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:33:58
We can only hope eh? Bitcoin certainly has some bugs to iron out, we can only hope theres no *major* show-stoppers. 
This is why I get frustrated seeing people micro-manage every hour. If you want results you cant realistically expect anything short term, but rather in the long term. 
Of course Im *not* saying theres never a need to micro-manage... That has its place at times as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:14:52
Yeh bitinnovate is really one of the only acceptable ways right now, and that went down as soon as MtGox did when it hit around $70.
Its still not the best solution though, since it requires you to cash in the deposit at a bank within 4 hours. Im ~30mins from the nearest bank where I live, which is of course not open 24/7. So its very restrictive, when you *need* the ability to buy at any moment, whether day or night.... Hopefully some better options appear fast for us Aussies. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:30:01
I really hate proverbs....
How about some information? Discussion? Speculation even? Just about anything holds more worth. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:39:07
You can live in hope, with a potential crash coming up. 
Then its just a matter of riding the next wave. I really wish I had more money to invest :/
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:08:51
Its great unless you want to buy outside of business hours. Buying BTC you only have 4 hours to pay for the order at a bank before the rate you bought it at is changed back to current market value. 
So it sucks if the market falls to $40 or something at 5pm in the afternoon and you have to wait until the next day before you can even think about buying.... By which point its probably changed again. 
But yes I have noticed theyre good with the customer service. The one time Ive tweeted at them they replied very quickly. They always keep everyone up to date with whats going on. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:30:58
Alright, cheers for the info. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:46:26
I feel your pain. I managed to scrape up some BTC yesterday just for laughs and to get some numbers on the board. 
Really wishing there was a more direct/usable method though debit/credit cards or something for us Aussies (there could be, but I havent found it yet). If there was I would have probably bought a couple of BTC today now that the exchange has slumped again. But, no luck!
And happy cake day!
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:00:01
What are the fees like for Mt Gox using wire transfer or domestic? 
I'll probably be validating sometime in the near future, just wondering if theres much difference since it still takes ~2 days either way you do it. Guessing domestic transfer is a slightly better/safer way to do it if anything...
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:11:00
I'd only ever get paper wallets for people I know already have a wallet and bitcoin setup. Otherwise yeh, it would just be a pain and most people wouldnt 'get it' or for that matter want to get it. 
The only other time Id give BTC to someone is if I was very sure its something theyd be interested in get into.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:55:13
Yeh, I actually started mining dogecoin yesterday, just for a laugh. Now keep getting tipped haha
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:14:04
Exactly. 
'All Time High' flashes up and so the panic begins (it would seem)
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:55:19
Just out of interest, looking at bitinnovate - if I was to purchase on that site at whatever value it currently is (ie $125), the exchange will obviously change by the time Ive made the cash deposit, so will the bitcoin value I purchased be the value from when I submitted the order, or from when I deposit the cash hours later? 
Im guessing the former. Also bitinnovate is back up for purchasing now it would seem. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:07:29
Anyone know around about when theyll be shipping? Will be interesting to see what kind of impact it has on the market... Thats for sure. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:18:11
I keep wondering whether anyones killed themselves over bitcoins yet. Like the people who were buying stuff for hundreds (if not thousands of) BTC years ago, I can only imagine how they feel now considering they *could* have been millionaires by this point. 
So there have been reports of suicides after the previous bubble burst? :/
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:25:16


&lt; _&lt;
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:33:45
I imagine this can be attributed mostly to the fact that the bitcoin is still relatively new and still has many growing pains (Gox issues in the past 48 hours for example). A lot of the infrastructure wasnt prepaired for the sudden popularity (which still isnt a *whole* lot compared to what it could be in the future)
Theres a lot of things that will need to be ironed out before things can even start to stabilize a bit.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:32:29
Ahhh, everyone throws their arms in the air in complete despair every time the exchange drops. Its what happens, the system is young and has some issues to be ironed out. You cant just give up on the whole thing and think its over because of 2 rough days. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:22:39
I still dont get this reference. What did I miss?
