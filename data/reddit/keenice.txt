If you said I'll give you .25 BTC then it is BTC if you said I'll give you 2600 dollars and that equals X BTC then they owe you 2600 dollars worth of BTC when the item is billed is a discussion you need to have with the purchaser and probably set a policy for future reference. Generally priced at the purchase date.

Bank of America and Chase won't even allow asset management companies to bank with them unless they're using their prime brokerage services. They say they don't allow direct competition to bank with them.
