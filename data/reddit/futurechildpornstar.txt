Samsung is more credible than most other ASIC manufacturers, but will it honestly be released to the public this year?
Does anyone remember the Halong Miners? Did anyone ever receive the DragonMint 16 Th/s miners?

This is a misleading title and there is no reference to Bitcoin (or crypto) in the article. JP Morgan (nor Michael Cembalest) have made any explicit comments about the dollar losing its status as a world reserve currency, and the article is the opinion of ZeroHedge - NOT JPM.

You're right, I meant same seed for different public addresses.

1. Use a hardware wallet.
2. Double check the address you copied and pasted.
3. Use different withdrawal addresses tied to the same seed every time (with the exception of  - i.e. use one address today, a different address next week, etc.
4. Use a test transaction ($0.01 - $10) if you're sending larger amounts and are concerned about typos or phishing.
5. Don't use a mixer unless you're confident in how it works and are willing to take the risk of losing your funds. I haven't tried  but it's well-known and fairly "trustless."
6. Every time you spend Bitcoin from a secured wallet, I would recommend moving the balance to a new wallet (ideally using steps  again).

Alexander Liegl of Layer1 (new mining facility/company backed by Peter Thiel) makes an excellent point about how mining is effectively exporting cheap electricity: 
I think his points are more salient with respect to the "energy solution" than this infographic. This infographic is highlighting the more efficient/eco-friendly ways miners have been sourcing their electricity (important in its own right).

Theoretically, wouldn't that actually work? 
If national debt is calculated in dollars and enough money is printed to make the value of the dollar drop, wouldn't he *theoretically* lower the value of the national debt?

Sounds great! Looking forward to the iOS version in the future.
[I'll try to make a more user-friendly tutorial when I have time, but for those interested, I used Android-x86.]( It isn't the ideal solution, but it's cheaper than buying a new phone.
[Here's another tutorial on installing Android-x86.](
