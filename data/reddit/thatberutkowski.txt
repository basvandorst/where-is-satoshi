"Thin air" meaning the largest, strongest military in the history of the world and the economy and tech powerhouse behind it. It's worth is based in the value of it's citizens. Don't be delusional

You guys are becoming your own satire. Bitcoin was in the limelight because of alphabay and now people don't care anymore. Unless another major upset like that happens again, I'm not so sure you're going to get much more publicity. The public doesn't care about bitcoin, they just want money. 
For you to make money, someone has to lose money. Who do you think will be on the losing end?

Most tips I've seen, and I agree, is to invest less than a tenth of your net worth and to only invest money you would be willing to lose. I did 700 at 8100. This is more than 10% for me at the moment but I have alerts set so I will know if it starts to nosedive past a certain price. In the end, it's a gamble.

Right now I'm using coinbase's app, but I'd like to have something easier. I set up an alert for ever 100 dollar rise and fall from the current price. Wish there was something that did that on its own

The biggest shock to me was how serious bitcoin is. I thought at first it was just something people fucked around with in small amounts. It blew my mind that there are people who bought in for dollars and have made millions

I don't have the balls. And I'm only 22 and I need those things! I'm happy I found bitcoin and I'm going to invest heavily into it, but I definitely want to start diversifying. Learning all about bitcoin trends really helped me with the basics of investing and trading

I use coinbases app and buy off of their other website gdax. I manually entered alerts for every 100 dollars it goes up and down from the current price.

Jesus, how much did you buy back then? I could only imagine. I'm really hoping I can say something similar in a year or two

Probably the same place as our Russian money
