The rise of the hacktivist generation will destroy these peoples lives for what they are trying to do. Laugh they will, until they don't. You can do some crazy shit with a computer and a little incentive/knowledge.

They just like money, they will pump  anything they get their hands on. Bcash was an instrument - Nothing more

You might not get Bgold. Should have bought last week. Not being a smartass, just the way it goes. I missed Bcash the same way.

If everyone agrees to pay more than BTCs price for one of these forks then they are free to do so. Only problem is people are willing to sell these shitcoins for a low price. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:53:23
Took 24 hours for mine. I pushed them though.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:00:08

I personally think we should value BTC in Lambos. 1 BTC = 1 Lambo. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:31:38
Me 2. I trade tho.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:13:18
Can I sell for that price?
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:08:40
Could I sell? I would take that.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:39:29
You do not need to fork BTC or increase block size or any of this moronic nonsense. Scaling exists today in the form of the lightning network and will remain the actual solution for the foreseeable future.
