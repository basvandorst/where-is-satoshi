Am.. most ATM companies sell them for 20k$ and more, you are refering to the ones that also pays out cash? Doubt that, cash safe alone costs 7k$.. I think you confuse ATMs with kiosks where you only purchase crypto with credit card..

they honestly believe BCH is the true Bitcoin (satoshi's vision)... for them BCH is Bitcoin and BTC is a fake... hard to understand... I do not believe they are evil, they just honestly do not know... check they live in a weird illusion, poor guys

Bitcoin cash is an unusable fork of Bitcoin and it will slowly die out, simple enough?

Sell asap, it will be worth 0 soon
@_date: 2019-08-02 11:24:06
This is not BTC owners, but the ones that sold the BTC... this is a big difference

I honestly did not know Roger was such a douche.. he values people by million dollar? Roger.. you are an unraiser low scumbag, do not think your millins will make you succesful.. go back to your basement.. bitcoin cash? A copy of a  copy? Are you serious? Gtfo

Hm, that seems to be a wallet receiving address, not the private key... pew pew!

I do not agree.. I think art and gold gains should also be taxed.. everything should be taxed, but on a much lower degree.. taxes pay for your gps satelites, police security, in Europe also for a free health system and free eleme tary and high school
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:07:29
Well, not that btc is rising so much, guess everything else is just, dying...
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:09:37
I honestly think Bitcoin currently lacks taxation layer.. if it had one it could be wirely accepted by governments.. taxes pay for community and are natural
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:32:17
Is not that the only logical taxation? I think so
@_date: 2019-09-06 10:44:42
Do not worry, things take time, I expect the stability and a mature acceptance, trust after 5-10 years.. patience is the virtue of all

I have already set Forbes to my Blacklist in my phone VPN... as well as cnet... both became crappy as s***
