Make sure to dig through all your emails, searching for info or simply 'mtgox'. They give all your transaction details for buy/sell in them.

Same for me as well, but that is when I last used mtgox.

Do you have a link to the FBAR form to fill out? Also, what is MtGox's official address to put on the FBAR?

Hand stamp both the public key and private key on separate steel bars, along with a non-bitcoin identifier (ex. "1") on each, then deposit said steel bars in separate safe deposit boxes in separate banks.

"first business to accept bitcoins"?

On btc-e:
Trade bitcoin for altcoin A
Trade altcoin A for altcoin B
Trade altcoin B for bitcoin

the naysayers will still be there when BTC is $100,000 USD.

This is where Ripple will come in handy. Once services like ripple are established, all the exchanges' rates will equalize.

If nothing else, I think bitcoin is backed solely by necessity. It is a tool that more and more people see as  capable of fixing some serious problems in the monetary transaction system/complex, on both a microeconomic scale as well as macroeconomic.

The first "attack" on bitcoin will not come the government, but from hollywood. The first movie to ever demonize bitcoin or virtual currency in general will be enough to sway a large part of public perception.

Im waiting for it to bottom out, so I can buy back in at Dollar Store prices. I hope it goes under $10.

Don't. Buy a small amount first. Wait a week. Then see if you feel like buying more.

If the president issued an order to "turn in your bitcoins to the government", bitcoin, as an asset, would immediately be rendered completely worthless in the sole possession of the government. Maybe we woul lose our bitcoins, but the government would gain absolutely nothing, in stark contrast to the 1933 gold grab.

I'm not a fan of wal-mart, but if they started to accept bitcoin as a form of online payment, i can think of no faster adoption of bitcoin with the masses. With that said, they'll probably be the last.

I'm hoping for (2013 bubble high / (2011 bubble highest price / 2011 post-bubble low)) prices.

For omething as futuristic as an entirely new monetary system such as bitcoin (which could not have ever existed up until a couple decades ago), the People will find a way to make it work. The idea has been born, and it is propogating in more and more people's minds, but the fight may take generations to fully uproot the old system.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:29:07
But only a fool would stop thinking and preparing for it.

At the last crash, with a high of 31, it bottomed around 2. If the same logic holds true with this one, 266 should see a bottom around 17 or so. Not that there's any logic to this anyway...

I look at digital currencies like I look at fast-food restaurants. The more there are available, the more options there are, the more likely people will flock to them.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:34:08
fiat currency doesn't have intrinsic value. Intrinsically valued money, for example, means they have another value based upon the materials they are made of, such as gold and silver coinage, apart from the face value.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:26:53
As we have it today, we buy/sell BTC on exchanges, and spend them with merchants who accept them. Is there a chance there are unintended utilities/possibilities that the bitcoin protocol and/or digital currency in general may offer besides these two things that are little used, or non-existant now? Im just taking time to stop and think about is really at our fingertips now that we may not realize yet.

I bought bitcoins as a small fraction of my investment portfolio, a portion deemed 'high risk' and that I would go long with it for at least 5 years. This rollercoaster ride over the last few days and weeks doesn't even move my meter of concern.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:15:45
Why would they when they can just enter numbers on a computer and add billions of dollars instantly to the money supply?

i'm waiting for it to bottom out so i can swoop in at $5/btc again.

Given enough time, BTC will look like a share of Berkshire Hathoway stock.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:13:58
I'm sure there are quite a few different factors merchants must take into account, but a bitcoin-back rewards system, under the right circumstances, would definately increase a merchant's customer base and help retain customer loyalty.
