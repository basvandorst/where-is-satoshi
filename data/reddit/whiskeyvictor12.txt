Taxation is theft. Decentralization means to end war by making theft impossible. B-itch Cash is the opposite of everything peer to peer currency needs to be.

 Maybe their security is better than yours (newbie) anyway? What if newbie sends his btc to a bch wallet?  ... these things have been said b4, I'm just a parrot. It's the people who don't spend the time to actually get the information into their own damn heads who bother me; because those are the same people who cannot see through bitchcash Rogers talking points.  .. whatta ganna do

I don't think you understand capitalism and how bitcoin can free all of humanity,  government is a plague, bitcoin is the only way our world doesn't completely become 'a brave new world'

Never going to, I imagine the are a lot of people like me who will sell everything and get as many coins as possible at 1k, and I imagine this may be true of at least half as many people who will pull the trigger at 2k and 3k
