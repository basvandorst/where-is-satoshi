Cool indeed, considering that the entire UTXO set (around [1.13GB]( 144+ blocks, 400000+ block headers is all that is needed to do full validation with a pruned node.

The bitcoin token is a stored representation of proof of work, so this is already how it works with minimum relay fees and without delays when sending transactions.

For a wallet with several unspent outputs, that is NOT a good way to do it because you will have many inputs, making the transaction much larger than it needs to be, and will pay for too many fees than what would otherwise be necessary.

Bandwidth was proven to be faster over time and not slower, so it would make sense to only increase the maximum. There may also not need to have the value encoded in the scriptSig. The amount that the block size increases could be based on how full the blocks have been in the previous two years (or a more frequent interval), and at the maximum not exceed the rates as specified in BIP 101.

AFAIK, Pieter Wuille supports increasing the block size:

For clarity, the block/transactions index and unspent outputs are stored in LevelDB, however the blocks are stored in blk* files (and the block/transaction index record positions in the files).
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:44:16
IMHO, BIP 100 and 101 should be combined in some way.

Bitcoin for donations works exceedingly well, and especially when directly accepting bitcoin, and only takes a few seconds.

Having a more elegant dynamically adjusted cap I think is ultimately going to be the solution in four plus years, with adjustments based on current technology to create a cap for:
- The amount that the utxo set can grow based on the RAM and SSD market (or future technology)
- The max block size based on current bandwidth limits and storage costs
- The number of sigops per block based on the CPU market

The PUD proposal questions the profitability of mining in the hydropower based county. The proposal would lead to a 20% power rate increase for cryptocurrency miners. For the next five years there would be further increases every six months by 10%. The increases are specifically targeted at cryptocurrency miners in addition to data centers. However for data centers, there would be a lower 10% increase, with 5% increases every six months for the next five years.

It will only change the `package-lock.json` if the version is bumped in `package.json`, and these changes are *very* noticeable. This is the same for *any* package manager with similar features.
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:28:58
Code review fixes the problem. The issue *isn't* package managers, as there are hashes to prevent unintentional upgrades.

So how many times has bitcoin "died"? Hard to deny bitcoin volatility, though this will likely stabilize as the market matures and is increasingly not based on "trends".

That's hard to know, patents grant monopolies, so there is always a risk, especially if there isn't a statement that says the "monopoly" won't be used, e.g. defensive schemes.

It should only change package-lock.json if the version defined in package.json is not satisfied by what is defined in package-lock.json by the definition of [semver]( In which case, the change will be visible in a git diff.

Showing the wrong bitcoin graph (BCH instead of BTC) also shows that the writers, et al.  are not looking into this more than superficially.

The title isn't accurate, this attack was specifically targeting Copay *(details below)*, and does not affect Node.js wallets in general. This is caused by a lack of code review of dependencies, and can be an issue with *any* bitcoin wallet.
Copay maintainers have commented on the issue with the details on the affected versions, primarily: "If you are using any version from 5.0.2 to 5.1.0, you should not run or open the Copay app." [

This isn't necessarily the case. Many package managers include files to prevent exactly that from happening. Rust has a `Cargo.lock` file with checksums for each dependency, this is no different than the checksums for C++ of Bitcoin Core (see at [ Other package managers such as `npm` for Node.js include a `package-lock.json` file for the same purpose. Other languages have similar features. What *isn't* common with many of the package managers for various languages, that package managers for GNU/Linux such as `apt`, `pacman`, `yum`, `emerge` all have is *signed* releases with the checksums.

Debian is also leading the way with [reproducible builds]( for a long time which will give additional improvement. There are several key areas that need help though.

If there can be more transactions, there will be more people using the network, and more demand to run nodes and better decentralization.

Great idea, it will be interesting to see where this goes.

UTXO commitments sound like an interesting idea.

In summary:
- Implementing SPV wouldn't be secure as it depends on having all block information 
- Using a DHT could mean that data could become inaccessible
- Mining pools could reject including OP_RETURN outputs in transactions
- Consensus hash requires computation that may not be necessary

There can be consolidation of all utxos into a new genesis block, this block could reference the merkle root of all blocks of the previous chain. Validation of the historical transactions could be verified, however it wouldn't be necessary.

This is popular idea with peer-to-peer electronic cash, but it is unclear how it is implemented.
I would imagine it would resemble:
1. Establish connection to peer
2. Setup a micropayment channel with the peer
3. The seeder requires updating the balance of the channel for a set number of bytes transmitted before sending data.
4. The peer sends data request with an updated balance
5. Seeder sends data
6. Repeat 4 and 5 until the channel is exhausted or expires

Rather than voting for the size, why not vote only to decrease or increase the current max size by a predetermined factor? And require 75% to agree? Also shouldn't there be other max limits that can be adjust in the same faction; max sigop counts, utxo growth and block size?
@_date: 2015-10-03 01:04:18
It happens often, and it is due to the two blocks being won quickly after each other.
