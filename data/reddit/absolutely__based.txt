If all the users see something as being worth $10, nobody's gonna buy for $15k
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:23:15
Lmao, literally pyramid scheme lingo

It's absolutely absurd to think that this rate of growth will continue forever, you need a job.

No plenty of people know. At this rate it'll encompass global GDP in probably a couple years.
None of it is real

Is $21 trillion equivalent to about [20% of all US dollars]( that have ever existed and ever will exist?

So twice this has happened?

By definition, government is the only entity that has the legal monopoly to use force (including deadly force) as a means of making you do something.
It's harshly worded, but 100% true.

But your bank only accepts fiat - why would you charge anything else for rent?

The automotive arm of Tesla is by no means a tech company
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:28:03
Until Tesla prooves themselves capable of actually making a lot of quality cars, I don't see how you can say that
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:16:22


But why?

Wait so asking how I'm getting screwed when you say I definitely am is pedantic?

It will never long term succeed unless people quit this "investing" bullshit with Bitcoin and actually start trading with it like a currency.
@_date: 2018-07-17 13:37:29
But those aren't bank accounts...
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:09:02


I've had a generally positive experience with my credit union, for the past 10 years or so. How have they been screwing me?

"5% drops in 20 minutes are totally organic. It reflects a 5% drop in people's trust in the underlying technology and people's valuation in bitcoin as a store of value"
\- you
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:19:27
Not for a long time, because hardly anyone actually uses Bitcoin ATM's. It doesn't make sense to do so for most folks.

There's also a finite number of 1992 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme's, why aren't they worth $6k?
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:59:04

Oddly enough the market was more normalized 7 years ago than it is today
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:15:36
So are you honestly attributing 5% / 20 minute drops to volatility? Is that your position here?
