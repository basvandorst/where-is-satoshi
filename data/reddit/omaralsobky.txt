Well I've been able to find out where they are based through the IP addresses. I might post something on reddit and see if theres anyone based in the countries that could notify the police...
Not sure haven't thought it through yet..
Thanks man.. I would so appreciate that..
I had 15 coins in there :( 
I am going to find these guys. I need to find out who else has been effected.

Yeah that's right. Well I'm open to opinions and different strategies. 
I know where they are and I have some friends in the country so might contact them and see what they can do.

Thank Christ! 
Where is it? And is it RoboCoin
@_date: 2014-05-28 07:53:32
Yes it is! What a load of crap, just when I was going to pull out they froze my account and I was unable to access or withdrawal my bitcoins.

Is there a way of tracking the website and  get arbitration involved? 
@_date: 2014-06-26 10:39:29
Why is it wrong for me to post an address?
