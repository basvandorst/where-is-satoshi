Until PCI-E ASIC miners are a thing GPUs prices will suffer due to crypto.

Too many people are gambling with money they shouldn't. If you look at this as an actual long term investment it's been nothing but good news. A 50% sale? Sure, I'll take that. I'm not worried about not selling at 20k. I wanna sell at 100k :)

I dunno, I didn't downvote you

If you add a middleman what is the point? The Achilles heel that we all knew was there all along has found it's first victim in Steam. On chain is the only way I continue to support Bitcoin. As soon as we are required to go back to traditional methods of transfer we lose everything that is great about crypto. 
I believe in Bitcoin because it was first to market. Not because it has the best tech. We'll see what happens from here.

There's an equally good of a chance that by the end of the month when all the Chinese exchanges are closed that it'll plummet. But yeah man, there's a chance that bitcoin could double or more in it's price in a matter of years. You're not gonna be a millionaire by buying this dip though, do a lot of research and see what you find in some alt coins too.

Good attitude :). I'm new myself man, I've just been browsing this sub, and . There are a few beginner's guides in the sub that are pretty good. I work in IT with some stuff pretty closely related to IoT so I've been trying to wrap my head around how things like ETH actually play there. Learning about block chains and different mining setups etc. 
I guess make some goals for yourself. Figure out what you wanna do in the crypto market and go from there. What I mean is, when do you plan on cashing out the BTC you bought? Is it when it hits 5k? 10k? Do you plan on making a short term or a long term gain? Don't panic sell and always always always check the source on information. JPMC's CEO says BTC is a scam? Now why on Earth would the CEO of one of the world's most powerful banks shit talk a decentralized currency hmm? 
Read up on Bitcoin and get a good understanding of what it is and why it's important and how it's different from the US Dollar. Then go read up on the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Then check out the difference between Bitcoin and BitcoinCash. It was about at this part when it really kind of dawned on me why there are so many alt coins and why the price of a BitcoinCash was so much lower than a bitcoin when they're essentially the same thing right? 
I dunno man, read up. That's what I'm doing. And don't be hasty. This is a really spooky time to be getting into crypto. There's a lot of things happening at once. If you buy in big now you could look like an idiot or a hero in a couple of weeks, but I really doubt you'll regret it in a couple of years.

Exactly, it will only go up ;)

Hey man, good on you. Do your research and when you have come hodl

Before I started doing my homework I didn't realize how much a coin can be split so hearing 4300 price point is definitely scary.

100% me tonight. Seeing my wife's reaction to a 30% portfolio growth in a week made me head bang and I think it made her a believer.
