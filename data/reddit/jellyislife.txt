Hi! Yah I live in NZ and only have a few brokers available here. Looking into Coinmama and contacting my bank for further info. I might put in $10 a fortnight into bitcoin if the first is successful and smooth. 
I'll probably leave it for a long time. Don't see myself using it in the next 5 years or so. The fee is ~6% for buy and sell I think but if im in it for the long term will I still profit? 
I might PM later, don't want to waste your time on newbie questions. THANKS!

How much have you put into researching about bitcoins and finance?

I'm new but if I keep investing more and more and plan on holding it for 10+ years will it help?

It may not be much but I'm thinking $10 every fortnight. Since I live in NZ there aren't much brokers especially using debit card.

I'm a student athlete with a part time job. I would have more but I'm puting money into KiwiSaver (like 401k), saving for a 'rainy day' and occasionally treating my family.
I'd like to invest more, hopefully when I get more free time. $10 could easily turn into $30 or so.

Yah I could easily see it worth while if even my future family can benefit from it. I don't really see bitcoin as a means of money, kind of hard to explain. 
I'm not going to use it unless something urgent arises. 
Let's roll :)

oh, i never looked at like this. Thanks! I always thought of the wider view, if you get what I mean and seeing this is somewhat obvious but completely passed my judgement.

just that investing in stocks is usually only profitable once you have $1000s

I live in New Zealand. Using the site that r/bitcoin recommended and filtering it with the payment method being debit card it only came up with 2 options. Both with ~6% fees
These are mainly international brokers and the only broker that actually was in NZ only had buy sells of around 7k, no way a beginner like me could get there right now.
I'm looking into altcoins but it seems its only international brokers, no local brokers online. There really is no hype into bitcoins in my country. Well really investing as a whole isn't widely encouraged because its 'gambling'.
You'd probably have to look into it more, there may be physical brokers down in the city but online there seems to be little. 
Cheers.
