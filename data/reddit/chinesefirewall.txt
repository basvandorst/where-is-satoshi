It could be due to an issue with the Chinese firewall.  I remember that AM was having a high % of orphaned blocks at some pt before the issue was resolved.  Possibly having smaller blocks helps them to propagate faster and therefore get accepted (or at least they believe it to be the case).  Or the nodes that publish the blocks are poorly connected due to the firewall so they are just not able to collect as many transactions.
I don't know of course and am just speculating.  Ultimately I think it not a huge issue for the network, and it is up to them.  If you have a problem with the blocks being added, then start hashing.  No one controls bitcoin and just because you believe it is wrong, does not mean it necessarily is.  Someone shouldn't be shamed / banned because they have poor network connectivity because they are still helping to prevent a 51% attack, which is a greater concern.

OK right, just saying its not really a "threat" and not necessarily "anti-social" if it relates to connectivity issues.
Also it is a good point that we do rely on miners acting in good faith, but it is in the miners' best interest to publish blocks that make bitcoins the best for all users.  If people can't spend their bitcoins, then they won't use bitcoins.  If no one uses bitcoins, then bitcoins are not useful as a medium of exchange and miners' have no incentive to mine.  So essentially assuming that miners want to be profitable, it is in their best interest to make bitcoin the best for all users.

Why do you say in May?
