You believe that quantum computing will not pose a threat to the underlying cryptography in bitcoin for centuries to come?

Wouldn't it be unlikely that stores will give their cashiers the private keys to spend from the companies wallet. Without the private keys how could the cashier sign the transaction?
And even if they could sign, it's not quite the same functionality as a gift card. What if my daughter gave the store clerk 5 bucks for them to sign a transaction that sends the remaining BTC into her private wallet? Alternatively, if the money *must* go straight into, let's say, starbucks buisness btc wallet there's no way the clerk can spend money out back to my daughter (and to himself as a tip for helping her) without it being very apparent something fishy is happening by a glance at the blockchain.
The key is I want to control the output addresses of transactions rather than the signatures on transactions because this forces any fishy behavior to be apparent to both the business and to the father as noted above.
**To the rest of your comment:**
I don't want to get caught up in this particular use case, my vision is not about gift cards, in truth I don't really like gift cards, I want to push what is possible with bitcoin. Right now that means asking, can output addresses be fixed?
I believe the same exact transaction principles to a gift card could apply to [commitment contracts](
* set goal: lose 20 lbs
* make contract, if I don't lose 20lbs in 60 days I'll give 1 BTC to [Julien Blanc]( (google: most hated person in the world - this is for motivation, no one wants to give the most hated man more money)
* So that I stay honest I give a referee my 1 BTC and let decide if I meet my goal
* BUT so *they* stay honest I control the output of their transaction to either Julien Blanc's BTC address if I fail or back to my address if I succeed. (controlling outputs like gift card)
* Finally if my ref doesn't verify that I succeeded by 60 days the BTC defaults straight to Julien Blanc (expiration date, like gift card)
I'm sure there are other ways controlling outputs could have cool outcomes. The question remains, can it be done, and how?
edit: grammar, spelling

Maybe... but Silicon Valley is dumping a bunch of money into buying coins and creating bitcoin services. I don't think they'll tell you bitcoin is a sure thing but it has the potential to be great.
It's too early to tell if it's already fading or it's just a little bump on the way to success.

**Entropy** weak argument
The easiest way to explain why I said that is by going to the extreme... do you believe bitcoin will be around in 10 million years? Certainly *at some point bitcoin, like all things, will fade given a long enough timeline*.
Now, it's not really practical to care if bitcoin is around or isn't around in 10 million years. But the point is at some point, whether it's 70 years or 70 trillion years from now, bitcoin *will* die.
**Human Progress** strong argument
Now given the rate of change in technology (digital computers as we know them are only, what, 50-75 years old?), and also that I specified "bitcoin, in *it's current state*..." I don't think we need to talk about millions of years. I personally could see radical changes in threatening bitcoin as we know it in 100 years or less.
I know it's popular to complain about how shitty things are in the current world, like banking, but the reality is that we live in some of the best conditions that humans on planet earth have ever lived. And despite this fact we consistently work our asses off to make it even better.
Bitcoin is great but you better believe that some kid in 50 years will be complaining about bitcoin fees and the time it takes to verify txs or the space it takes on his hard drive. As progress is made in a multitude of arenas it's hard to predict which new security holes could pop up in bitcoin, or which new advances in related fields could overshadow bitcoin.
The belief that bitcoin is the pinnacle of all human achievement for the rest of time is shortsighted and naive.

So If I am understanding this - the right the way to do this is to set a 2-of-2 multisig transaction to an "anti-charity" and then, sign the transaction and send it to my goal moderator. Then if I have not met my goal the moderator signs and the BTC is donated to the anti-charity. If I *did* meet my goal a new multisig transaction is made back to my personal account where both me and the moderator sign. Great.
I have a follow up question...
**Are there any currently implemented ways to set a "time limit" on the signature, for example, "If the moderator does not sign by May 1st then donate the funds automatically."**
I think [this section on the wiki (Providing a deposit)]( addresses a similar trustless "time release" issue but I can't wrap my head around certain issues like a transaction within a transaction:

I'll edit my question for clarity, I am referring specifically to the protocol and the technology behind peer-to-peer electronic cash
@_date: 2015-02-08 07:12:31
Indeed I believe it is, in fact I believe it could be done with something that I've heard called "transaction chaining" where 1 transaction uses the hash of another like [in this example]( on the wiki. But I am having a hard time understanding how it works so I thought I'd ask around, thanks for the article.

Law of physics? Are you talking about bitcoins cryptography? Because most evey one agrees that QC's could break at least some of bitcoins current crypto
@_date: 2015-02-17 09:49:13
This surprises me to learn this, I was under the impression that anything a traditional computer could do could be broken by a quantum computer. Thanks I'll look into quantum safe hashing and digital signature algo's.

the only relevant reddit thread I found with your [search term]( was this [1 relevent thread]( that only had [1 comment]( with any insightful information
Almost all comments and threads found are saying bitcoin will never die, or sarcastically say it died in 2011. This is not true, all things die. Maybe it's not in the forseeable future for them, but bitcoin will die. If it doesn't die then we failed as humanity to continually be making improvements.
