I was always afraid to buy Bitcoin when it was in the media because I figured it would be a bubble. Didn't buy at €100. Didn't buy at €1000. Then when it rose to €10k I finally went "fuck it" and bought a lot. I even managed to sell very close to its peak. Then when it started dropping again I figured that it would go back up quickly and re-invested everything plus some more at €13.7k. It's at fucking €7.7k right now. Pls send help.
In all seriousness though, I'm hodling. It's not like I have a choice at this point. Pretty much like everybody else.

Knowing me I'll probably refuse to sell at a loss unless my ability to sustain myself is at stake (which it isn't). I can be stubborn sometimes :D

Well geez now it's just dropping like it's hot.

Yeah let's not talk about that one time when I bought IOTAs at $4...

Don't worry guys, payday is coming up and the law of Bitcoin dictates that the price goes up every time right before I buy, so I'm sure we'll be back to the moon in no time.

You *do* know that CS 6 and earlier can literally be "cracked" by changing your systems hosts file to prevent it from calling home, right?

Call Reddit, hit your lawyer and delete the gym.

*sighs* wake me up once it's above €12k again guys. I'll be over here, hodling, like I've always been.

Really? I thought these minimal amounts for card payments were a very German thing, since we still tend to use cash a lot. In other European countries I have paid amounts smaller than one Euro using my credit card and nobody seemed to mind (in fact there was this one time a small tea place in London refused to accept cash at all and I had to bail out my sister with my card, that was fun).

Even the Toyota logos have a BMW part number. It's pretty hilarious if you think about it.

Aw crap. I know this is normal and all having been here back in 2017 but damn I do not like the direction this is currently taking.
Then again, that means I can buy more.

Feels like Steam sale, except for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:52:25
Eh, it's not like I have millions riding on this or anything. I've blown more money on way sillier things before.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:32:21
Nah man, there's no way I'm selling that stuff now. I'll ride this thing all the way down to zero or all the way back up to 20k.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:20:25
Keep calm and HODL
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:11:45
Trust me, it does. But I know that if I just HODL long enough, I'm going to have the last laugh ~~hopefully please send help~~
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:25:59
Nah, I'm hodling to avoid that.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:57:28
Flash sale! Grab it now while it's hot!
On a more serious note, that must have been a *huge* whale dumping his BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:05:25
You for not buying the dip.
