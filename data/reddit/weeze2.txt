Same here. I could not log in and contacted support. They replied that it migt be that my mobile service provider might be blocking the sms and that there was nothing else they could do.
But a few days later i started working again.. So not sure what happened.

My best bitcoin moment in 2015 was when I made my first purchase with btc - I bought a beer.
During 2016 I am going to buy and save more bitcoin. I have one now and by the end of next year I would like to own 3, if the price doesn't go up too much.

And here I am using a bitx MasterCard to burn my Bitcoin I saved since last year. Oh the irony...no wait..

Fuck that, time to dust off my U3

Thanks! Yes I buy a small amount each month.

The 3% transfer fee seems a bit high.

Nice to read something that makes sense.

So do I understand this correctly? If say a few hudered people with miners at home keep solo mining the chain left behind after a hard fork - will that chain be able to survive and function parallel to the stronger chain? If this is the case the value of the coin would drop but it could rise again and i would mine the shit out of it.

Hi, I also have a weird address in my Blockchain wallet.
Receiving small transactions and sending it out right after without me doing anything. I do have 2 factor authentication and my log doesnt show any activity during these transactions.
I have informed Blockchain about this and they wanted screenshots ect. I send a bunch because some of the transactions had thousands of inputs. They never got back to me. ~~And another strange thing was that the next day my transaction history was different. Some of the transactions with thousands of inputs were gone - I exported the data to Excel and one transaction had over 2000 entries.~~ 
EDIT: The input address 38DPYmsa7RXwLrhpTP6udrfSiGn5dzdGAC send small amounts to over 2000 addresses of which my address 18VxeqVC9C1oQEh164GQhLnWvLiLPuc4br is one.
It received 0.0001443 BTC on 2015-12-19 11:35:00.
At 2015-12-19 12:01:10 the amount 0.0001443 BTC (0.00012269 BTC after fees) was automatically send to   1LjdB7WC6JL4yrvp52AZfSP2JNwHFsSBJ3 - this is just one example of many :-)
I have noticed that it’s just the one address - I can have btc in any of the other adrersses connected to my wallet but if I send a few cents to this address, it’s gone after a few minutes.
At one point it received 2 BTC. The only reason I keep my account open is for the day I receive a large amount to this address so I can move it to one of my other addresses.

Interesting. So its possible that demand could increase again in 5/10 years if people get unhappy with the longer chain or there are use cases for both chains. Up until now bitcoin has proven its worth.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:31:19
Good because I can imagine that this mmm thing at some point is going to be used in arguments for banning btc.

Are they going to contact mine farms and try to get them to mine for them? With the halving coming they could buy mining power 'cheap'.

Thought this was catchy.

Coin Traveler app lists 10 or so bars and restaurants.
I have tried Heidi's Bier Bar and they accept btc. So you will be able to get beer at least.

how much is that in grams? My calculator can't do the math.
@_date: 2016-07-20 22:01:08
Something like this? 
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:40:09
Yes but it could be possible to avoid that. I just saw this post here on R by David_Moskowitz
Maybe in a few years when more work has been done and a vote can be individual it could work. Every person on this planet that vote could have their own "address".
