Relative to games it does decrease in value. So it makes more sense to spend my money on more food instead of games? It might give incentives to not hold such money but I refuse to believe that not inflating money will halt trading. Also inflating money could just lead people to store value in another currency (Bitcoin?) and avoid the inflation alltogether.

"me having a couple of bitcoins" is what satisfied my needs. The Bitcoin project without me being part of it didn't satisfy any of my needs. I had to own a few coins to feel part of it. So the coins had value for me. Call it novelty value; it's value.

I don't think there was a similar case in his time so he couldn't have imagined something like that probably. But if there was such a case back in his time I see no reason why he would excluded novelty value. From what I've read Austrians have a really free and wide interpretation on what is considered "need" and what has "value". So I wouldn't expect Mises or any Austrian to come and tell me "no these don't have value" the moment I am giving up on electricity to have a few of them. But it looks like some do tell people that. :-|

Printing coins to pay of salaries shouldn't be different to taxing more and using the tax money to pay salaries. Printing coins dilutes everyone's money equally so even taxing should be more fair than inflating to pay salaries. At least I think so, I just don't see the difference between taxing and diluting the money in my pocket. It's the same thing but dilution mostly hurts those that a "fair" tax system wouldn't hurt that much.
As for the second part, the business would either halt operations or go on GLBSE and sell bonds. It's a small economy but if you are talking about businesses operating with bitcoins then probably you imply that it is done in a big scale. So there will be people to buy the bonds. But we are far from that scale, I agree on that.

What part of Truecrypt's license do you specifically object to?
It's pretty much like GPL2 but they don't allow you to use the name Truecrypt or derivatives, the oblige you to include the "based on truecrypt available on truecrypt.com" somewhere in your program and documentation and that you will remove any phrase that says that this is the official version.

Exactly my points. Inflating to pay your debts is even more unfair to taxing to pay your debts. And the point you raised about storing value in land is good, never thought of it that way.
And, yes, Greece isn't going to switch to Bitcoin but some people have already started some kinds of local currencies (I haven't heard of those latelly though to be honest) and Bitcoin could help in that sense.

That assumes that miners run according to a strategy that maximizes their own profit and not the well-being of the network. If you believe that miners run that way then this is not the only problem. For one: miners should never propagate transactions if they want to maximize their earnings.
I'd say that the incentive to mine properly and not follow the most profitable strategy for the individual is that you want the network (and therefore bicoin) to work. If you start deviating you realize that the coins you'll earn won't have a value since the network will collapse.
Still I suppose that we should put incentives to make the individually best strategy be globally best too. Microsoft researchers proposed a way to give incentive to propagate transactions. I don't know how you could avoid the problem you described though IF miners start mining in a selfish way (although I doubt they will).

I don't get this. If we were trading in gold coins and we needed more money, wouldn't gold coins get automagically more expensive? Why does there have to be someone to dilute the money supply by creating more counterfeit money? (cause that's what fiat money is)
As I see it, printing more money essentially means that the state will invest directly or indirectly into private bussinesses that newly created money but at the same time make everyone poorer by dilluting their existing money. So in essence the state taxes EVERYONE and then invests the taxes to bussinesses. That could be done even if Bitcoin or gold coins was the currency used, to the extent that Bitcoin could be taxed (it could be taxed I believe in many ways).
So doesn't inflation have the very same effect of taxing and investing the taxes or using them to pay wages? What's the difference?

If you intent to turn this into a proper social experiment then the game world should be isolated from the real lives of the players. By allowing bitcoin trade your experiment will basically fail since people's behavior in game will be affected by their real life needs.
BUT I would definitely allow out since it would be practically impossible to ban it. You will just drive people into finding new ways to trade without you noticing.
I could for example get killed and jailed by someone on purpose and then offer him 60 diamonds to release me. While in reality this whole thing would be staged so that I can give him 60 diamons that he bought without raising suspicion.
BTW I play on your server every now and then. It's kinda laggy for me (Greece) but it's fun.

I haven't thought of your first point. About negative effects now or later. I'll give it a thought and I'll play the game you linked. For now I only wonder whether the negative effects that you will have later (like decreasing the debt of companies that maybe should have defaulted should the state haven't issued new money which caused inflation) outwight the positive effects right now. In the end though when a state issues money to pay of debts is like giving a vague promise to its citizens that the new money have value, tricking them into valuing that money higher than they should, and then giving them to whomever it owes money. I'll think more about it though. Maybe you've got a point there.


Isn't this like saying that not wearing a seat-belt does not increase the number of fatal accidents because there are a myriad other factors? Of course there are other parameters but keeping them constant (and that is how you always examine phenomena) printing money =&gt; inflation.


Depending on how you define "fair". I find taxation unfair in general but that's just me. Most of the people think it is unfair to tax someone that tries to live in Greece with 400e/month when the super markets are on average more expensive than in Germany for example. You can't expect to tax those people equally with someone that owns two buildings full of stores and keeps less of his wealth stored in a bank. Actually as most people on the thread point, inflation is mostly hurting people on salaries and those that don't have debts. In other words it helps everyone but the ones that try to live with 400e/month.


I've never seen anyone's salary rise up in sync with the infaltion of prices in the market. Has it ever happened anywhere in the world? As a freelance **I** can ask for higher payments but my parents would have to wait for more than a year for their salary to catch up.


Actually you can't get it without someone to enforce contracts (even the GLBSE ones). It doesn't have to be a government. If the Bitcoin economy grows, then some people might offer proper contracts about what will happen with the liquidation of their assets, should they default. In that case you won't need a bank. You've got a contract. And even in the context of current governments this could work. It just needs to grow and some will offer proper guarantees.


Bitcoin can help create a free market and that's all. Whether this would lead to a better economy depends on how you define "better". I think it would. Ripple is very nice and smart but I think most people will find it quite complex to grasp. Bitcoin is closer to gold which is proven to be easy to use, at the context of any society.

While I'm not particularly good at game theory I think it doesn't.
Take it that way. If everyone propagates transactions then your best option is to NOT propagate transaction as this will let you make more money than others
If nobody propagates transactions then again your best option is to NOT propagate transactions as this will again let you make more money.
Propagating transactions does no guarantee a higher chance for other to do likewise so it's like the prisoners dilemma.

But if you change it to SLL (second life dollars) the graph won't work. Also users are free to switch the graph to another source (other than BitcoinCharts which is the default).
How could I retain the ability to change the graph while making it reflect the ticker change when possible? I could put another option to use custom or auto graph. And if the user selects auto it will try to reflect the user's selection for the ticker. Would that be enough? Should I include more option on the "Auto" choice, like length of graph? There are TONS of options if you go to BitcoinCharts.

Honestly Flattr sucks big time. Their fees are insane. They charge 10% on EVERY microtransaction. Instead of charging people for money they actually WITHDRAW from their system, they charge for transactions INSIDE the system like they cost anything to handle them. So if I tip someone one euro and he tips another euro to someone else and this goes on for 10 steps total, the end result is that 10 people have collectively paid Flattr 1 euro so that Flattr transfers 1 euro from my account to the last one in the chain. So 1 euro in fees for an internal tranfer of 1 euro from one account to another.
PayPal is crap, yes, but I honestly would prefer to randomly pick someone to donate to from my "donate to" list every month and give him the whole amount using PayPal, instead of going through Flattr.
If I misread the Flattr FAQ somewhere about the 10% fee, please correct me.

Actually paying more fees will lure more power to mine since more fees mean more profitable mining -&gt; more miners trying to get a share of the profit.
The problem is that the perfect strategy is to convince everyone to pay more fees and stop paying them yourself. I think that in the end we will have to enforce minimum fees included in every transaction. This will drive microtransactions away so probably we will need a second system to handle those some other way. Maybe in a centralized manner?

A actually a stable currency benefits whoever is paid a fixed salary because they will receive predictable value as payment. If someone is paid on a aper project basis, he can adjust the price he asks as he wants. But if they are paid on a fixed salary then, usually AFAIK, the salary doesn't go up immediatelly after then currency gets inflated. The result is that for some time he is paid less, while the ones that can pick their price get paid normally. This is like taxing the ones working on salary; it's exactly like that I believe.

In theory if you respend the coins after 10 blocks (and send them to yourself again) along with a reward equal to 10*50+*something* BTC then the miners should prefer to discard the last 10 blocks. Actually since each miner has probably found no more than one of these 10 blocks even 20BTC would be enough.
 Of course the current code doesn't allow this but someone could make a new miner and advertise it as more proffitable. If that miner becomes widespread then it would cause a problem. [edit] Actually it would have to be more than 50% widespread for the fake chain to become the main one... So it's a question of whether the 51% of the mining power are legitimatelly interested in the well being of bitcoin or if they are just trying to profit from mining.
Miners building blocks based on profitability and not on proof of work... hehe.

Not exactly. Silkroad doesn't have a public IP and that is the only reason why they can't track it down. If GLBSE had a .bit domain then it would have a public IP too, which AFAIK works as well as a domain in tracking you down. .onion pseudo-domains don't translate to IP addresses. .bit though do.

Flattr is terrible. They charge for transactions INSIDE their accounts and not when you withdraw or deposit money. Unless I am mistaken.
Credit cards are not anonymous.
So use bitcoin for the low fees and some level of anonymity (when used correctly)

There is no way for a state to adopt a currency that it can't control. If states wanted that then we wouldn't have left the gold standard. But I'd like to see them actually collect the taxes needed to buy F-18s directly from the people. They can't tax that much without an uprising of the people, and that why they need their own currency: To tax us by inflation secretely (most people even think it's good to cut new coins to pay of debts) and then buy their military equipment, pay for guards for the politicians etc.
I just don't believe there will EVER be a state that adopts Bitcoin. The people will.

Very low thresshold. I think most wallets are ephemeral so, I think, that the chances of them growing is about the same as the chances for them to empty. I would take whatever they have inside. Most users probably make a wallet, buy some bitcoins and store them until they spend them. There is no reason to think that if the user ever buys more bitcoins he will buy more than the ammount you see the moment you stole it.
Oh and all this if we suppose that there is an address poll in the wallet (100 spare addresses), else the chances to see it growing are even less.
If someone writes a script that shows the history of the balance in a wallet, I would gladly run it and give you the stats. Maybe we could do a small statistic to find the thresshold.

But time spent isn't as effective as money transactions. For example I might spend 4 hours per day and the most devoted players will spend 4 times that. So taking only time into account they will accumulate wealth about 4 times faster than I. But if you allow them to buy stuff from other players for real money then they could go as high in wealth accumulation speed as they want. They could get a job and work for real money for 4 hours/day and then buy diamonds with their real money. That would allow them to become rich as hell (in game) and ruin the experiment as nobody could get that rich just by devoting more time into the game.
I agree though that keeping the real lives separate from the game is practically impossible. I just say that bitcoin transactions probably kill off the social experiment CivCraft was AFAIK intended to be.

Why is it good to force people to spend more than they would do otherwise? And in a free world why would any rational person use dollars instead of bitcoins? Even if your salary was in dollars you would convert it to BTC immediately, store them and then spend them when you need something. Businesses would also have intensive to accept bitcoins even if dollars are legal tender to serve customers better. And if taxes require dollars then so be it, trade your bitcoins for dollars right before paying your taxes. I still don't see a problem in a system where people are NOT forced into an inflationary currency to force them to spend and invest more than they need to. I don't say that having deflationary currencies is inherently bad. Neither stable ones or deflationary ones are inherently bad to have. I'm just saying lets have them all and see what the people choose to use. I bet they will choose the deflationary currency and I don't see how that will cause any kind of shortages or spirals for reasons I've described on another comment here.
Also venividivixi I realize that you wrote this 9 hours ago (1 hour before my other answer) but I'll repeat something form my other answer here. It can't be a spiral. You can't expect *everyone* to stop investing. Some people will stop investing (or actually OVERinvesting, cause that's what happens in today's economy IMO) until investing into the then under-invested economy will be equally profitable as hoarding. So hoarding will be just another way to make an average living perhaps, which compared to successful entrepreneurship (actually serving people, something that not everybody can do) will be pretty much nothing. We will still have food, research, cars, roads, everything. We will create fewer things, but even you said that we spend more money on things BECAUSE OF inflation. So in fact we don't need that many things. We just prefer them instead of holding onto our fiat currencies which we know will depreciate.

That is, if you trust this site. But it's a neat idea and might entice people into getting a wallet and trying out Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-03-31 00:14:19
 if you can compile it. I would give you my compiled binary (for windows) but that'd miss the whole point of being able to generate the wallet without trusting someone. :-)
As for importing the private keys later (you are only supposed to import the keys when you want to spend the coins) you can use the bitcoin daemon which, for me, is easier than setting up those python scripts.
Command is like:
./bitcoind importprivkey 5KJkvo8KM4iW63km7r7QMMmq9NRAB4HUrKah5jQkR97HGvm6sqX
So print the wallet in script form using the program I gave you (and not in QRcode form) and when you need to import them OCR the script and run it.

To explain this procedure to my father I'll need about a day. To my mother a week. Telling them how to use bitcoinary should take an hour or so.
Yes, it's not that hard but it all depends on the person. If you are going to spend an extra hour every time to get things done right then it's similar to paying at least 2.5-6 euros in transaction fees for the time you lost. :-) (unless of course you enjoy the procedure, but that is not the case with everyone)

But nomatter if it is viewed as a precious investment, if it's the only currency like thing you can use (meaning other people will accept it) it will have purchasing power so it can still be used to buy what you need. Sure bitcoin might get "expensive" but that means two things. That you are unwilling to give lots of bitcoins out to someone else in exchange for a tomato, AND that someone else is willing to accept very few of your precious bitcoins for a tomato. So trade is possible just like at any other time.
Now you might say that there will be no point in investing anywhere else, since you can just keep your coins and wait for them to increase in value. But if people stop investing that means less produced goods, which will lead the price of bitcoin relative to goods to stabilize to that point where "investing" in bitcoins will be as profitable as investing in anything else.
@_date: 2012-10-27 18:28:03
In the end transaction fees will be the only thing left to profit from. If they are too low, compared to power spent to mine, miners will move away from bitcoin. This will cause a drop in difficulty. In the end the whole thing will balance at that point where mining is as profitable as any other enterprise. 
The problem is that if that balance is too low (in terms of total Hashing speed) the network will become vulnerable to 50% attacks. And I still don't see anyone providing a solution to this. Of course people are participating in BOINC projects. If bitcoin is accepted by the majority on earth then people will probably already have realized that they need a free currency and who know, they might consider spending some CPU cycles in mining btc instead of searching for extraterrestrials or advancing medicine. No idea if this will be enough though.
Even if the block reward didn't halve every few years as it does now, there is no guarantee that it would be considered enough to keep the difficulty high enough in the future.

You are right, this isn't about Greece. I should have stated that as a concern for the stability of euro taking into account what happens in PIGS.


And what if it falls in value? I suppose I should only pay taxes if it rises in value AND I sell my BTC for euros, right?
@_date: 2012-05-24 01:06:11
The debt is in euros. To print more money we will have to switch to drachmas, print tons of them, exchange them for euros (dropping the value of the new drachma extremelly low in the progress) and use those euros to repay the debt. Then everyone will start getting paid in undervalued drachmas and will probably be unable to buy anything that is produced outside of Greece. So in the end, the people will become poorer.
Whether they will be poorer than they are now, I don't know. I just know that printing money isn't a really good and fair solution. Inflating a currency is something that makes the state richer, the banks richer, anyone that get's paid directly by the state for big projects richer and everyone who is on a fixed salay poorer. In fact inflating a currency to pay of debts is like taxing most people and paying the debts off with tax money.
(of course this is just my poor understanding of economics so if someone knows better please correct me)

I think CPU speed grows faster than the rate of transactions in the world. Now whether there will be a point then the Bitcoin transactions outgrow the CPU power I don't know. But it doesn't seem that bitcoin uses much CPU right now. You will only have to validate a single block every 10 minutes and even if the blocks become 100 times larger, I still think it can be done by a modern CPU. Also you don't have to validate the whole blockchain. Just find someone you trust and he will give you the last known valid block after which you can start valudating on your own.
EDIT: I might be wrong on the last part. I don't know how you can be sure about the validity of someone's signature without being able to trace the bitcoins back to their generation. How is this handled by lite clients?

I didn't say that this is how it should be done. I was just answering to the parent comment that you can't just repay a debt in drachmas; you will have to follow a path similar to the one I described. I don't say we should follow that path; on the contrary.

@_date: 2012-07-10 03:00:40
I think that even with 51% of the mining power in your hands you can sustain an attack for as long as you keep that 51% since your chain is growing faster than the 49% chain. So you can pick which transactions go into the chain. Now to also be able to put one transaction in and after a while produce a longer chain that doesn't contain that transaction might need more than 51% or you'd have to wait some pretty long time till your second chain becomes longer than the one of the 49% which believes the transaction happened as you said earlier, and is building upon that. For some time you'll be on par but eventually you'll be able to catch up with them.
Damn I need to brush up on these stuff...

I don't think so unless you can provide some definitive proof that the seller scammed you.
But even if they don't that won't be a problem since the site never said it will protect you from such scams. There are many 3rd party escrows (I like BTCrow) that can do that stuff. Demand the usage of an escrow from the seller if you are worried about loosing your money.

If hoarding is a problem, and as you say people would be fool to spend for their needs instead of hoarding then why do people buy goods that fall in price in our society (computers and gadgets for example)?
Let's suppose that everybody starts hoarding. Nobody is buying stuff which drives prices up. But also nobody is investing since hoarding yields the same "interest" or even better. That means production will fall as capital goods stop working (machinery etc) since no one is spending money on accumulating new capital goods. Well, low production probably means low supply which will raise the prices. The prices will go up to the point when the people will realize that they don't fall as they predicted when they started hoarding, so they will start spending. At the same time people will have an incentive to invest on this under-invested economy since it will now be yielding more "interest" than hoarding.
hoarding -&gt; lower prices -&gt; less investments -&gt; low supply -&gt; higher prices -&gt; less hoarding -&gt; more investments. It looks like a negative feedback loop to me.
 I'm not saying it will happen in that order of course, just that there are many forces driving people to invest or spend. In the end all those forces will stabilize somewhere based on peoples time preferences. How many beers would you rather drink tomorrow than one today.

I am still thinking about this. What would you do and why? I see good reasons for both. I suppose I could mark original content as such before approving it.
@_date: 2011-10-29 17:34:32
No reason actually. Let suppose that someone uploads a few pictures he got from somewhere else. The question is if you would pay to see them in high res. If you would then just pay for them until you can find them with tineye or google image search elsewhere. If you have already seen these pictures, then you won't pay for them and they will be forgotten and moved downwards in the hottest pictures frontpage. If it becomes a problem I will put a captcha.
@_date: 2011-11-27 13:21:41
I'll keep it in mind. I can't use it now because the API can't show the BTC received by address.
@_date: 2011-10-29 23:03:02
So I separated the SFW from the NSFW pictures and now the site is only for publishing content that can't be found with google image search. Also for NSFW content users need to follow a validation procedure.
I hope this satisfies more users than before as well as keeps me safe. :-)

@_date: 2011-10-31 01:59:32
From now on the pictures on the site can't be found via google image search or tineye elsewhere at the moment of approval. I do this manually for every single image using the high res version of the image.
@_date: 2011-11-01 15:51:56
Check out the uploader ID feature. I just made it. You can use it to create groups of photos like albums or user pages.
@_date: 2011-10-29 18:26:50
Hmm... It would be dangerous. For example I take a nice photo that I value for 4BTC with single user buy now price of 0.5BTC. What if someone posts it on reddit after only paying 0.5BTC and then nobody would wan't to pay for the full res? Well it could be an option for the uploader but I think nobody would take the risk so I don't think it's a high priority in my to-dos.
@_date: 2011-10-29 23:46:40
You mean to have a price of 0.5BTC for the community or 4BTC for a single payment? But why would one pay 4BTC when he can make two payments of 0.25 each (so that it looks they aren't from the same person) to get the maximum resolution? I means it's kinda strange. The only case is if you want to be the only one that gets the picture without helping the community even though this costs you more. So the user is selfish as heck :-D. But even if he does, the community can reach the 0.5BTC later and get the picture for everyone, so he will be the one that paid for no reason 4BTC. I don't see why would one want such a feature unless I didn't get something correctly. :-)
@_date: 2011-10-29 18:14:07
I will put nsfw and original content filters soon. So people will know if the high res version is something that google image search can find (at the time of approval). If they still want to pay for it so be it.

@_date: 2011-12-21 10:30:35


I don't think that makes much sense. :-) Either it is a good investment or not, regardless of the amount you invest in it. Selling your house to invest the money on the other hand is probably a bad idea whether it's a good or bad investment (because the risks, nomatter how improbable, probably outweight any benefit)
Risk wise I don't know where Bitcoin is now. I guess it's like any other highly unstable paper currency. But if more people used it I think it would get much more stable than $ or euros. (If euros are even considered stable anymore)
Someone in the comments of the blog said it's right between gold and fiat money. I'll probably agree in a few years...

If you see pictures that have both sides bigger than 50px then someone paid for them. Now whether this is the uploader who was testing the site or not, I cannot know. Someone paid for one of the original pictures though (which were mine) so yeap some paid.

I view the pictures in high res before approving them and although I am no expert I try not to leave anything illegal. But I guess there is no definite way to be sure so any advice is most welcome. Should I ask for some kind of validation before approving pictures? I could do a manual confirmation via email that this is indeed the pictured user for nude photos. Although I will try to keep the system free of user accounts.

The blockchain is proof that you sent the coins. But nothing proves you sent them to the correct address. One could argue that he doesn't own that address and that you did a mistake.

Depends on the picture and the price if you ask me. Someone could sell  webcomics or any other piece of art (nude pictures anyone?) for a low price and the good thing is that someone else could only pay a small portion of that price to get a lower resolution version of that image. It's like crowdsourcing for images.
As for other media types it's not a bad idea although it's harder to reduce their quality. Might do it with sound files in the feature.

1. That won't be easy if the exchanges are spread over the world. I'm not sure how many there are. If they are few and concentrated in a few countries then yes they might be able to subpoena all of them. Although still someone willing to pay an assassin could easily add more layers between the exchange and his money. (like a freshly stolen credit card, or prepaid cards purchased anonymously (i think it's possible IIRC))
2. It's not that easy but yes it could be done in some cases to hint you which exchange is the one used. Unless the assassin owns an account in the exchange and you can do the transfer internally.
So what about OTC?

I will add flagging soon for illegal pictures although it's hard to judge from the low res pictures (I really don't see an obviously illegal picture on the site, if someone does please tell me which one you mean). Currently we are adding the "sfw" and "original content" filters. Next will be flagging, then permanent links to specific pictures (to advertise them on other sites) and then probably a comment search function.

Mined 100 when you could mine a block per week. Kept them and sold about 20 to play with. Spend a few more for purchases. Got some from tips and microtransactions. Got 25 from a website sale recently. So I got about 80something...
During the 30$ mark I had about 60BTC but I decided not to sell. (which I really don't regret since it was impossible to know when it would stop going up + I wanted to keep my precious mined coins... :-) )

Well I don't think I can ask for them that easily. Lot's of work on my side and you are practically asking for a system where you need a purchase receipt from the image uploader. But you don't actualy buy the picture. You pay the uploader to make it publicly available, that's not a purchase I suppose. So if you found a photo on imgur saying its on the public domain when it's not, and use it, ad get sued, what would imgur had to do with it? They only keep an IP as well. The only one that made claims about the photo is the uploader which is hidden behind an IP. I only know that they have to agree with the ToS before uploading the image which means that they declare that they own and practically waive their copyright. If they lie, all I know about them is their IP which I will give to the police or a court if needed. What more could I do? BTW I 5 minutes ago I changed my mind and the site will only accept seemingly original content. That will help avoid most of copyright related issues. But the legality issue still exists. I will also put some kind of verification for those that upload nsfw images. They will have to go through a photo verification procedure before they can upload (similar to Oh and the server is down temporarily for some reason... :-(

Just to make this clear. I am not an investor in Bitcoin. I just fucking love Bitcoin as an idea and execution. I don't care to make money by buying or selling them. I want to make Bitcoins by mining (well not that many now) or by working or selling stuff for them. And most of all I want to see it replacing the dollar and the euro.
And I insist that I couldn't see a single point when I should have sold them. I don't know if other people see such points in time but I am almost sure that some people loose and some gain from such "games". And I prefer to stay safe. After all my general expectation is that Bitcoin will keep rising in value so in the long term I ain't loosing money.

Currently an inital factor is decided so that the smallest side of the picture is 100px. Then factor goes up to 1 the same way payments go up to the maximum. You think the payments should have no effect unless the maximum is aquired? Hmm that requires a lot of changes, from the site keeping the money untill the max is reached (while now it's a direct payment) to not getting the satisfaction that your payment actually did something the moment you sent it. ;-) In any case I'll think about different formulas of increasing the resolution.
@_date: 2011-10-29 18:05:14
Well definitely not me since I never made any guarantees. :-) But I see the problem... What would be a solution? Asking for legal identification from the uploaders would be too much I think. If you are willing to take it to the court I would help you by giving you the uploader's IP. But he could be using Tor so no luck... I might try to see how other sites do that. I mean how are they sure that the uploader owns the copyright...

I never bought bitcoins so I'm still in a "winning" state value-wise. If I had sold them when they reached 10$ (which was unbelievable at the time) I would think I am a looser when they reached 30$.
My idea was that since I have no way to predict the future value and when the rise would stop, I could as well keep them and see where this goes. I don't see anything idiotic in that considering I can't predict value changes. If you can predict them then fine. But most people that would sell them at 10$ (thinking that was the top of the hill) would probably buy again seeing that the reached 20$. Until they reach 30$ and some loose money in the end.
In the end I don't think there is an easy way to predict such fluctuations. Was there anyone that knew that the top would be 30$?
PS: why do we put the $ before the price? You don't say "dollars thirty"...

There are many different exchanges (like Mt Gox). Governements can't know which service you bought bitcoins from unless they spy all bitcoins clients that belong to exhanges. Also they don't know the assassins bitcoin address. In the end it could like this: they find the assassin, make him give them his address, find your address from the blockchain, find that you got those bitcoins from another address, probably belonging to an exchange and it all stops there. They can't just go around exchanges in different countries asking for who is the guy that got bitcoins from you at that address.

Wow too many questions in the first part but I can't answer them all here. There are answers to all of them and I hate to be that guy but... you can read "For a new liberty" which answers most, if not all, of them. Honestly I can't start answering to all of them now. :-)
I'll stick to the first one. People that care about their health would have to pay up someone to detect where pollution is coming from. Most kinds of pollution can be easily pinpointed, just fly an airplane above factories, backyards etc and you can see/measure pollution of all kinds. Also regarding "How could privatized courts possibly be fair to both parties?" simply, just like every company that competes with others, they will have to be fair because that's the service they are selling, if they are not fair people won't trust them and wont pick them for resolving cases. Not all of them will be fair but those that are fair will put others out by competition. The easiest way for them to earn money is to build a good reputation and keep it that way.


It might give people some control. But they really don't need it. Creating an all powerful group of people that controls everything is just a tool in the hands of the most powerful.
If a rich guy wants to steal 1 million from the people he can either do it directly or give 10 thousand to someone who YOU have given power to and then in cooperation steal 1 million from you. But a private court/police or whatever has a incentive to be right. A financial incentive. So if someone was trying to corrupt them in order to steal form you, the owner of that private company would expect a bribe at comparable to the net worth of the his company which will loose reputation and practically all it's clients. In contrast to the state were the owner doesn't care about his reputation that much. Nobody cares if out courts loose reputation. Nobody is loosing money because of it. It's easy to pay a politician more than he is otherwise earning and have him keep the courts corruptible. But if they were private, the owner would only allow this if you could pay back the worth of the court.


I still disagree with this. Morality IMHO is not a matter of cost vs benefit. Taking the victims right to sue his attacker in the name of social benefit or governmental control is immoral. If you feel alright having a government/organization/company/whatever to take care of pollution for you then that's fine. Just don't make it obligatory for everyone else. Of course I don't see how governement regulation on pollution would work if it isn't obligatory but that shouldn't be my problem. It should be the problem of whoever tries to impose his system  of governmental controls to everyone else.

Putting visible or invisible borders around a huge area most of which you haven't even walked over, does not give you any property right over it in my opinion. So countries even if defined as the group of people that claimed the land first have no valid claim over their land.

Many people believing something doesn't make it moral. 
Also even if you value your security higher than your freedom, who gives you the right to make that choice for the rest of us? Putting anything above freedom and then trying to force that upon other people is always fascist IMO. While putting individual freedom on the top doesn't force anything upon anyone. Don't tell me that you are forced to live with a neighbor that owns a gun because it (let's suppose) increases the risks in your life because I can use the same reasoning about living next to an alcoholic so I could demand that we outlaw alcoholism. 
Finally judging a moral system by the results is a bad idea. (isn't that called utilitarianism BTW?) There are myriads of systems that have excellent end results while they violate at any degree individual freedom. You can start forcing people to be organ donors, or even living organ donors. It would create a "happier" society in the utilitarian view but nobody would be free.

This doesn't make sense. You expect a group of people that believes that they are getting robbed, to use democracy (which they believe is flawed and destined to end up enslaving groups of people to other groups of people) to push away the ones that steal from them. Why would they do that?
If someone from your neighborhood come into your house and took everything and then did a vote with the rest of your neighbors to see how those goods should be shared among them and which you get to keep for youself, would you be OK with it? Would you try to convince them that the right thing is that you should keep them? Of course not. Why not? Because you don't recognize them as an authority to choose what's right for you and your property. You recognize the state to be the authority for this. Well, we don't recognize even that as an authority. We believe that ourselves are the only authority on this. Why is that hard to understand?

The differences between burglary and theft are irrelevant to what we are discussing. Also the Chace bank case you described is an accident, which can be corrected by the bank. If they refuse to correct it then they are aggressing against you. Now if the shifted those bits on purpose, of course it's agression. You gave them your money under the implicit/explicit assumption that they will keep them safe. If they fail to do so, that's their problem, not yours.
As for government services then yes, if a person indeed manages NOT to pay taxes he has no right to use any social services. There is, though, a huge IF in this. IF the state did allow private individuals to create private roads then there would be no excuse for a tax evader to use public roads without paying for them somehow. But since the state prohibits the creation of such roads, (an aggressive prohibition) then you are also free to use public roads without paying for them, if can manage that.
If you don't allow me to make my own food and insist that I should buy from some public supermarket only, then I fell just fine stealing from that supermarket. If you don't like that, just let me make my own food. You are the first to initiate aggression by violently forcing a monopoly. I am just taking what's mine back: the right to eat freely (freely as in freedom, not as in free beer). Same goes for roads, for protection services and anything else that's a state enforced monopoly.

If people start hoarding coins instead of investing them into businesses there will be a point where investing in the under-invested market will be worth as much as hoarding (worth: taking into account risk and possible returns). At that point the deflationary spiral in investments will stop. Thus you will have always a more or less steady flow of new goods/services. As for people not buying goods and services because they'll get cheaper tomorrow well this is ridiculous. People will buy what they need exactly no matter what. So at some point, all other things equal, demand and supply will be stabilized.

Keep in mind that wallet != address.
If you send 10 btc to address1 and then another 100 btc to address1. Then you can spend whatever amount from that address1 without using a second input.
SatoshiDice seems to be using addresses (so you ain't seding btc to some wallet as you said) that are the same for every user. That way if I sent 1btc to satodice1 and you send 10btc to satodice1 too, then AFAIK there is no way to distinguish between the two amounts when SatoshiDice send rewards from that address.
I might be wrong though.

You are just scratching the surface of the problem, or maybe not even that. Taxation is mass theft. You oblige people to give you their money because other people decided that this is "good".
It doesn't matter if they do it uniformly. It doesn't matter if they do it so that rich people pay more. It doesn't even matter if you agree on where these money is spent. The fact is that you have no choice to disagree about any of this. You are getting robbed and you are glad the thief might use some of the money to your advantage. And voting doesn't solve this. You and everybody else is voting on who will forcibly steal your money based on where they promise to spend most of them. Your are picking your thief. And if you are OK with the thief you pick, that's fine, but others aren't.

IIRC you cannot append data to any string to make a new string with the same MD5. What you can do is get a string and find two different strings that when appended to the original string create two resulting strings with the same hash. 
In other words given A,  you can find B and C so that md5(A+B)=md5(A+C). 
Of course I might be wrong, I can't check Wikipedia right now.
Actually given A and B you can create C and D so that md5(A+C)=md5(B+D).

First of all thanks for the explanations.
Now about the last part, I'm not really seeing any incompatiility in been both interested in the system itself (as an awesome tech perhaps?) and the things it can accomplish. Even if you told me that you've been in the feature and only 100 people use bitcoins, I wouldn't sell my coins. In addition to what I believe it would achieve in the future (which belief you'd just have ruined) I like them for themselves. As a toy or whatever. Sure I wouldn't keep 1000 euros in them, but I'd still want some of them. And I would easily sell something to get a few. To cut a long story, they would still be somewhat valuable to me. Less than they used to be when I was predicting that they will the currency of the future, but they would still have value.
Now, let suppose I am the only person that thinks like this, would Bitcoin, according to the regression theorem, be sound money? ;-) What if I could find 100 more people that think like this?
EDIT: did you edit your post? replaying to the extra points:




I mean that if bitcoins were 0.000001USD each, I would still like to own a few to "play" with. Same goes if they were worth 1000000USD each, I would still like some satoshis to play with.

So in Vietnam it's very profitable to be a doctor. If the market was free and borders were open, ie. there was no government, foreign doctors would have a huge incentive to move there, and entrepreneurs would try to open new hospitals there. And who would be the smartest entrepreneur? The one that does one less useless exam per patient. And who is even smarter than him? The one that does two less useless exams than him. And who is the smartest of all? The one that does no useless exams at all. So ask yourself why doesn't this happen. Why doesn't new hospitals arise since they are so profitable? You'll find that it's because of the government intervening in some way or another. Else this stupid oligopoly would have been broken.

Therefore their value is created artificially by the gov.


What do you mean? Novelty value exists because people like to own something for any reason that it's not somehow related to consumption. In bitcoins case though this value is inherent because of bitcoins qualities unlike the dollar which has no inherent interesting quality and only exists to pay taxes.


It is. My point is that consumption value is not the only way to have a spontaneous and "reasonable" initial value. To put this in another way: I would like to own bitcoins regardless of their price and regardless of if I could actually buy anything with them. I would like to own them for my "entertainment". I like to be able to send those weird unforgable tokens around the world instantly through a p2p network. In a way they adorn my computer so I actually have some "use" for them. So bitcoin had actual "use" in a small circles of geeks initially. It surelly does not have use for everyone but neither gold does. A hippie has no direct use for gold (other than as a currency) yet gold is sound money. Similarly a non geek has no use for bitcoin yet since it has actual "consumption" (or novelty if you preffer the term) value for a group of people, it could as well be sound money.
IIRC the whole idea is that sound money should at some point in the past have consumption value and then it started being used as a currency. That's what happened here. Bitcoin was valuable among a small community that was just happy to be part of it for the fun and novelty. That is Bitcoin's initial value.

No, unless the state obliges you to use its monopolized services. For example you can't make your own roads because the state doesn't let you do that. If it did you would have no excuse to use public roads for free. But the state doesn't let you use your own roads so, yes, it is moral to use their roads for free. They are the ones that put you in the dilemma, our roads or no roads ever and they don't have a right to do that so you can break out of such a dilemma by using their roads for free.
Health care on the other hand is different. You have no right to use public health care if you don't pay taxes. Although I could argue that in various states the state causes high entrance costs to the healthcare sector so it causes bad oligopolies but let drop that for now and just suppose that health care is a free market sector where the Gov also has it's own public hospitals. In this case my answer stands, it's completely immoral to use the public health care system without paying your taxes.

The fact that someone managed to pay for that high cost of entry gives him the right to reap higher profits. I mean it's natural: if he wasn't going to have high profits he would have never paid the entry cost, he would instead get involved in another sector of the economy. So high profits, maybe higher that what seems "right" to the customers should be expected.
Now if the market is free, other wealthy entrepreneurs, from other sectors **wil** accept the high entry cost if it's worth it based on the expected profits. If they do not do that then either you've run out of rich and smart guys on the planet (which is pretty much impossible) or indeed the profits are not worth paying the entry fees. In this case the one that holds the monopoly will be left alone reaping the profits. But the moment he tries to go higher and raise prices, it will make it worth for other to pay the entry costs. It is in his best interest to operate as close, but bellow the point where expected profits doesn't justify new competitors. So there are check in prices in monopolies.
Plus this is not the only way to break a monopoly. New technologies or ideas are the most common way. Sudden reductions in entry costs because of new tech, or abandonment of the good or service provided by the monopoly. Or simply enterpreneurs moving into the sector trying to satisfy a niche share of the market at the beginning can also break a monopoly by providing specialized services, and because of their smaller size they might be able to do this better than the monopoly company. Prohibitive entry costs usually only exist in very new sectors and the costs are "prohibitive" not for a long time. Sectors like food/health/eduation/roads don't have that prohibitive costs, there are enterpreneurs that would gladly move into all those sectors to break a bad monopoly.
Also do you really think that people use Chrome and Firefox because Microsoft lost those cases? Or do you even believe that the consumer's are better off with Microsoft paying fines? In the end the fines will be transferred to the consumer too. Either through higher prices in Microsoft products or lower quality in their products or in delays in the development of new techs from Microsoft's R&amp;D which would save costs in other ways: for example with less money in their bank accounts they might delay the development of Windows Defender, resulting in more infections, therefore in more money waster for fixing computers.

Just read what trolling was initially in wikipedia. And then apply it to a place other than usenet.
Let's say someone sells microwave ovens. You go up to him and start asking (loud enough for people to hear you) "Hey I read that microwave ovens cause testicular cancer and are the leading cause of cataracts.". The poor salesman starts explaining why this is not true trying to minimize the damage you caused. Then the next day you do the same thing. The point is that you say or do something that takes you 10seconds to say that causes someone else to have to explain something for 10 minutes either because he has to minimize damage or because you are abusing some OCD he has or because he is not the same guy as yesterday to realize that you are just trolling him.

Well it depends on how you define ancap.
How would you call a system where there is no state, therefore everything is provided by firms and individuals and additionally there is a market where capital is sold and bought and capital is owned by individuals? It's anarchy and it's capitalism therefore, by definition, it's anarcho-capitalism. There is no need for people to adhere to the NAP in order to have both anarchy and capitalism. It's logical and pretty much expected that they do adhere to NAP but it's in no way a prerequisite for either anarchy or capitalism. Anarchocapitalism is not about ethics.
You could argue though that if people don't adhere to NAP, then it's not an anarchy but again its a matter of how you define anarchy. If you define anarchy in a way the adhering to NAP is obligatory then left-anarchists are not anarchists at all. Any such definition seems bad to me since it doesn't help to highlight the common belief of all anarchists in the immorality of the state. So in the end, no state = anarchy regardless of what forms the basis for the ethics (or more accuratelly: the law) of the people.
Adherence to the NAP is Libertarianism. And if you are REALLY strict and you don't make any compromise in the NAP, then IMO you HAVE to also be an ancap since that's the only possible system that allows complete adherence to the NAP.

I never said it has consumption value (in the usual sense). I said it's a completelly new paradigm and the reason it is not encompassed by Rothbard and the others isn't necessarily that they oppose it, it could as well be that they never thought this would ever exist, so their definition of sound money was not articulated the way it would be articulated if they knew about Bitcoin.


Bubbles can happen with sound money too. There can be bubbles in Gold and everything else that is traditionally considered sound money. The only difference is that having a commodity value places a lower limit at the price when the bubble bursts, but usually this limit is way lower than we'd like to think. Gold is pricey mostly as a precious metal not as an industrial material AFAIK.
If an economy was using gold as currency and there was a bubble burst, the damage and chaos this would cause would be comparable to a Bitcoin bubble (if we suppose that Bitcoin was used by the same number of people that use gold in this hypothetical scenario).
Also novelty value could ALSO place a lower limit in price during a bubble burst, which in my opinion is similar to the limit placed by the consumption value. So again I don't see a big difference between Bitcoin and gold in terms of "soundness". Bitcoin's novelty value is huge. It allows you to do something "geeky" in a way that was never before possible.
The same cannot be said for dollars. They have neither consumption nor novelty value. They are not interesting in any way.

That's what I mean. Ancaps are usually libertarians. But it's really not a prerequisite. Yes most ancaps stress ethics but not as a part of ancapism itself. It's a part of Libertarianism which is the domininant ideology between ancaps but it's a separate thing. Ancapism explains how things will work. Libertarianism explains what should be legal and what not. They both go perfectly together and IMO you are a selloff libertarian if you are not an ancap and an idiot ancap if you are not a libertarian. But that's all the connection there is between those two things.
Yes, the only proper definition of property rights that doesn't contradict itself is based on NAP. Therefore I agree that for a market to function properly for everyone, you need something like the NAP or something similar. But, for example, mutilating women doesn't actually affect the market. You could have "free" market while still having enforcement agencies performing obligatory clitoridectomy on girls. Why would ANYONE be willing to **pay** to enforce such a barbaric law is beyond me. And I am sure he would most probably be unable to enforce it since most people would be willing to pay more in order to protect girls from this. But again note the use of "probably". There is no absolute guarantee that people won't suddenly be willing to pay for crazy stuff that violate certain aspects of the NAP.
Again I insist it's a matter of definitions. If you define capitalism as having an absolutely free market, and by free market you mean that the NAP must be STRICTLY adhered to then ok, ancapism implies libertarianism and you are right. But that's a quite strict definition of capitalism and you are left with systems that you likely need another word to describe. Like the clitoridectomy system I described. How would you call that? Don't tell me "just fascism" because it's not. There is no state, there is a market for capital and prices are allowed to fluctuate freely. I think it's ancapism but without libertarian ethics.
Anyway I think Friedman explains this better than me in the video...

You know I didn't say that they won't help anyone but the one that bribes them. I said that there is an inherent problem in any monopoly. The governmental police has a monopoly therefore it's bound to be inefficient and corruptible. They will of course do some work or else the people would revolt immediately.


If we had that system then it would have to be because people wouldn't accept a government to rule them, because they want to be free from centralized control etc. If someone did try to force a government upon them they would simply revolt and defend themselves. Just like today if someone would try to impose monarchy on them. But right now people are asking for a monopoly of power: military, police, courts etc. This is what I object to.

A transaction is invalid as a whole if it contains even one "invalid" input, meaning it draws coins from an address that doesn't contain any. (if anyone can correct or confirm this, please do)
What I don't know is how do they manage to "include your betting-transaction output" into the "inputs of the reward transaction". AFAIK bitcoins are indistinguishable. So if I send 1BTC to ADDRESS1 and you also send another 1BTC to the same ADDRESS1, I have no idea what it means to create a winning transaction for me that cointains MY 1BTC.

Considering that for every positive action taken by the government some people have to be robbed to pay for it, I'd say there are at least as many crimes committed by the government as the good actions they do. Also my main concern about the democratic system and state intervention in the market is not a utilitarian one. Even if democracy in its modern form was yielding good results,  which IMO it doesn't but let's say it does, I am still opposed to it because of the means used to achieve the end. The end does not justify the means. I can save 10 lives tomorrow by killing a healthy hunan being today after voting which one to kill and reap his organs. I can also rob a person today and save 10 starving persons tomorrow. In both cases it's wrong. I don't have a right to do that. Not now, not if some majority agrees with me. And similarity I don't recognize that right to any governmental employee. I don't care if it's his job to collect taxes, I don't care if most people think that it's good what he does. I did never hurt him and he steals from me. 
Of course in most cases there is nothing I can do. I'm cornered and the alternative is jail time. But I cannot agree to it even if it was giving a good end result, which it doesn't.

Humans *can** exhibit behavior that is not good for themselves.
For any behavior/characteristic to continue to exist, it's enough that it does good to the meme or gene that creates this behavior/characteristic. It does not really have to do good to the person that exhibits it or the society. As long as the behavior propagates the meme/gene that created it in the first place at a faster rate that it get removed from individuals, the behavior will continue to exist.
Take religion as an example. In the long run it has caused more trouble for society than good, yet it still exists. Why? Because religion is good for religion. And because religion propagates faster that it gets "cured". It doesn't have to be good for the person exhibiting it as long as the meme has a way to survive. If religion was more catastrophic for people, it would disappear faster.
In other words people can and will exhibit irrational behavior in groups. While ancapism places some very powerful incentives on NOT being racist etc, you can never underestimate the power of stupidity in (groups of) people. Groups of them could agree that black people are bad. If those groups are big enough, the lone wolf would be the one hiring black people in his business instead of hitting them with sticks. There could exist other equilibria, not just one where everyone adheres to the NAP. Depending on how extreme the violations in NAP are, that equilibria could have varying stability and could last for different lengths of time.
But I agree that in the long run the probable result is for everyone to adhere to the NAP. No guarantee though that this will definitely happen.

Why should the government be the one to control pollution when *I* am personally affected by it? Why should I "be fine" with the government deciding how much pollution is acceptable for me. Also no matter how many checks you put on corruption, someone has to make sure the checks work, and that someone will always be corruptible. IMO the only way to solve the problem would be 1. to let people sue those that pollute and 2. have courts that compete so that only the incorruptible ones will remain and they will be the ones to rules pollution cases. Same goes for every kind of crime, not just pollution.
The same courts would also not allow someone to change the climate of the earth as you say in your second paragraph. No need for government regulation, changing the climate and making your life more difficult or lowering your health standards from what they would normally be should be considered a crime just like every other attack against you. And you should have the ability to sue.


The question is whether it is possible for a government to stay uncorrected. But a government is just a bunch of people with a few checks from other people. No matter how many checks you put, it will never be a system that you can control as you wish. An unsuccessful politician will be one that gets caught accepting a bribe from an oil company. A moderatelly successful politician is one that doesn't accept a bribe. And the most successful of all is the one that accepts the bribe and doesn't get caught. The system favors the corrupt so it will always tend as a system to curruption.
A powerful government, regulating every aspect of the economy and the society is the best tool you can give to a crony capitalist. Without a goveverment he would have to go to court against all people for polluting and, if the court was private (therefore had the sole incentive to earn money) the capitalist would have to buy out practically the whole court for what it is worth in order to win the trial (because after that the court would go out of business since it would not be trusted by anyone so the owner of the court would expect a bribe at least as big as the court's net worth. But with government regulation the crony capitalist has an excellent tool in his hands: corrupt politicians and currupt courts. So now he can simply bribe x money to some politician to pass a law protecting him from lawsuits and you can't do anything about it because you already agree that the government should control pollution.
By the same token, if it was shown that on average, out police causes 3 accidental shootings to innocent people per year. If they try to lessen this number, they became ineffective in combating crime by fear of shooting an innocent. So in a way, a moderate amount of shootings to innocents is OK because otherwise the society would be worse of. So lets prohibit anyone from suing the police for shooting him and give the government the power to rule whether the shooting was acceptable or not based on some rules that says that up to 3 per year it's OK. In both cases you are placing the power to sue for a crime to someone else's hands instead of the victim's. And this will result in people getting bribes to turn those laws that regulate pollution/shootings in favor of those that can afford it: the rich capitalists in most cases.

Rothbard and the others had not experience of something unforgable AND decentralized AND without any commodity value. Therefore it's not logical for their definition of money to be encompassing bitcoins.
I believe that if Rothbard was alive he would argue that since bitcoins are used spontaneously by the people and there is no way to inflate them out of control, it is sound money.
Also, while I don't know if Rothbard or other Austrians share this opinion, when we talk about the "commodity value" of a currency, we should also take into account the novelty value it has. Meaning even if it has no commodity value at all (can't be eaten, can't decorate your house, can't be planted etc), bitcoin allows you to do some weird stuff that otherwise cannot be done. Like being able to operate a system where users are owners of unforgable data. Not something useful per se, but the novelty value is there.

If pollution indeed harms people (which it does) people shouldn't use companies that don't agree to be checked by third parties for how much they pollute. Additionally if, for whatever reason, people fail to do that, you can always take the airlines company to a trial. If a company refuses to provide proof that they don't pollute too much then most probably it's worth a shot taking them to court if you still see pollution and you suspect them. Why would the go to court? See bellow.


Lacking governmental police, each person would have to pay for his own police. Most probably one of the terms in the contract you'd have with your police would be that you will present yourself to courts when called. Else the court will rule the case without you, and your police will not protect you from the accuser's police which will come to arrest you if you are guilty.


These are problems in our society too. And in fact they are worst in our society because in order to get the police to protect you (the crony capitalist) you just have to corrupt a few politicians. In a free society you would actually have to pay for the police yourself while now you currput politicians so thay the pay for your police with the taxpayers money. It's cheaper to create a police state to your advantage today than if police was private and was competing with other police firms.


This is childish. It's like demanding that I pay a cinema ticket because there is an open air cinema across the street and I can benefit from seeing the movie.


So to avoid having people oppressing people, we have created the most oppressive organization with powers even on people's lives? Government will always run out of control and benefit those that pay the most. Because they are made of non-perfect people. Democracy needs incorruptible people in order to work. What I propose doesn't require that, it's based on people's tendency to benefit themselves.

I would object that it shouldn't be the government that does the arrests but that's another matter to discuss. Lets say I'm fine with them doing the arrests for now.




I can't view democracy as a valid moral system. If I did I would have to accept every democratically taken decision as moral, including Hitler governing the Jews and slavery in Europe and the Americas. The fact that those decisions had the support of the majority of people doesn't make them even remotely moral IMO. That's why I don't see why I should respect any democratic decision if it violates my (or someone else's) freedom when I haven't violated anyone's freedom myself (I am not a murderer or a thief).

Miners are the ones that create the blockchain with the most strength and the ones that give any kind of security to the currency. 
Merchants, nodes, and users are the ones that use the currency.
While miners are the one that take the decisions technically, they have to listen to the people or else their mined coins will be worthless. But THEY are the ones that ultimately create the coins so it's their rules after all. They are the ones the create the currency. It's their currency, and they MUST make it a good currency by taking good decisions or they will make no money.
If non-miners disagree with the miners' decisions, they can do nothing other than stop using the currency. Unless they become miners themselves and help create a new currency.

In the 50% case (one of the bets wins), there is a 50% chance that the winning transaction contains the part of the double spend that doesn't ever get included in the block chain. Therefore there is no winning in the long run unless you can somehow spend your money on another site that accepts 0 confirmation transactions.
Edit: jmw74 talks about another way though that might work.

Am I the only one that fears that a policeman will show up instead of a normal person and ask for some sort of license for trying to sell stuff before he takes me to the PD? 
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:19:35
Of course not. If I polute the water you drink or the air you breath then I am basically attacking your body and you should have every right to sue me the same way you sue someone for breaking your arm. Of course in most modern democracies the only one that is able to "sue" for pollution is the state (which also sells pollution permits) and which is also easy to corrupt by paying up a few politicians so that they will allow you pollute as much as you want.
About the right to persist as a species I am not sure what exactly you mean. Can you elaborate a bit?

It would be better if they didn't get involved into fraud resolution. They are a payment processor and they should stick to doing that. They may sell a complementary service like an escrow or a trusted seller fee if they want though, but it should be optional. IMHO.

We completely agree on this.
I also agree to your other points here. There is pretty much no reason to examine the weird clitoridectomy system because it's really unlikely that it'll ever happen. I just like to keep in mind that these are two separate ideologies (ancap and libert) that complement each other and IMO it's crazy to be just one of the two.

Normally if you host a torsite on torhost or freedom hosting you don't have access to the normal Internet using php. So you cannot check if coins have been sent to some address for example. Therefore you cannot create anything resembling an eshop without using weird hacks. So now torhost provides some api to check for transactions.

In that case almost any kind of left anarchy is not anarchy. That's a very strict definition of the word anarchy you are using. I don't say it's wrong but we need something broader to encompass any kind of system where there is NO of organized **monopoly** of violence (state). (That bunch of zealots is not a monopoly of violence)
We are arguing over definitions here really. I agree with you that that kind of ancap is just shit and doesn't really make sense for anyone to abolish the state and start mutilating girls. Usually you first stop doing the latter and the you abolish the state. ;-) But you can never rule it out 100% so I need some name for that kind of society. And since it fills both my definitions for capitalism and anarchy (in the broad sense of no organized monopoly of force) then I also call that ancapism. And the usual ancapism where people also adhere to the NAP is both ancapism AND libertarianism since that means to adhere to the NAP.

Most monopolies in the modern "free" markets are caused because of intense regulation. If you leave the market completely free and a monopoly forms then there are two extreme cases:
The sole firm provides a good service at a good price, and customers stick to it, reinforcing the monopoly and putting out competition. Still customers are happy with the service so no harm is done.
The sole company tries to raise profits by increasing their prices and or lowering their quality, this will end up sending customers to their competitors and the monopoly will break.
The reality initially will probably be somewhere in between and competitors will always try to break the monopoly because they want a share of the profits. Today of course this might be impossible because of patents, license fees and other factors imposed by the gov.
See it this way. Suppose there is a pure monopoly in cars for some reason. The company starts raising prices, not so much as to loose customers though. Still though it is earning greater profits than other companies in other sectors. Why wouldn't Bill Gates start a car company at this point? He would be able to pay the starting costs, in contrast with smaller wannabe competitors. Why would he still stick to computers when he can make more money in some other monopolized sector where competition is nonexistent? In all cases, why would a monopoly hold, if indeed there is more profit for those that would break it? The answer today is because the state protects the monopoly in the ways I mentioned above. Also the state is always a great tool in the hands of the monopoly holder company. They just have to lobby to drive out competition. In a free market, they would actually need to provide a better service to keep their monopoly, which if they did, then why would we care about the existence of this monopoly?
Monopolies might arise in free markets. They will also fail quickly without anyone intervening. Most modern monopolies (medicine, food, guns, whatever) are because of the state protects them. Yeah they might try to break a monopoly every now and then but that's not even needed.
Slightly relevant:
Where I live there was a huge fuss about how milk producers won a case against supermarkets which were forming a cartel. It was all over the news. Then I read the milk producers open letter to the government. Do you know what they were complaining about? Among other things, they were complaining that the supermarkets buy from the cheapest milk producers. That they don't allow them to set a fixed price for milk so that everyone will sell milk at that price. And this was announced as a cartel been broken. IMO this is a cartel been born. The super markets just wanted to buy at market price, the milk producers accused them that this is an agreement between supermarkets therefore a cartel and it should be stopped. And the gov stopped it. And this was announced as a success against cartels.

If they **knew** that, they would turn 100% of their savings into bitcoins, which I doubt they do. 
Most probable explanation is that there are not much fees for receiving btc compared to their other methods plus a little personal interest on Bitcoin.

Resisting arrest or trying to hit back a cop which tries to arrest you for tax evasion is. 
It always boils down to a gun on your head. Whether you are smoking/selling pot or evading taxes. Both are actions that you have the moral right to do but they are illegal and the state will go to any length to stop you from doing it.

Really? I have never connected German people with Libertarianism. I know that they are generally speaking better educated about encryption privacy etc but politically I always thought they are not against the state controlling their economy. And I don't think that many of them would agree that laundering money is a peaceful activity. Of course I may be wrong, I haven't actually talked about these stuff with Germans.

From the link you gave me: "In **Rothbardian** anarcho-capitalism, [...]  principle of non-aggression."
Meaning in the form of anarcho-capitalism described by Rothbard the NAP is the "law". Rothbard described a specific form though. It doesn't mean that anarcho-capitalism as a name cannot describe systems where you have anarchy, capitalism, and no NAP.

In some other comment I gave the example of mutilating women. Imagine a society where people can trade freely and there is no state but young girls are obliged to undergo clitoridectomy by enforcement agencies because most of the society agrees that this mutilation is necessary for them (perhaps because of their religious beliefs?) and is also willing to pay to actually enforce that obligation. After that mutilation everyone agrees that women are free individuals and therefore the market is not distorted by anyone. You could still have capitalism.
