Ditto to that guy. Electrum is one of the best software wallets

Take caution, people.

It's way too soon to say that yet, but I'm afraid that may end up being true. I'll be pretty annoyed if the rapid price increases are done now. I was really enjoying those $1000 milestones every day.

Hey so I have a question: what does the price of the future actually mean? Like right now the XBT bitcoin future is at $16,090.  So what is that dollar amount actually mean? is it any relation to the actual price of bitcoin or is that just coincidental right now? Is that the price that they think bitcoin will be? I don't really understand.

Thought it might hit $13k for a bit

Question: looking at the GDAX trade history, why are there a surprising number of trades of exactly 0.0001 BTC? What's  special about that number?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:59:55
Gee, I really hope that's not all that it rises. I was hoping for $20k by then...

He’s correct. Electrum is good, that’s what I use. The part to be careful with is when you move it to GDAX. There’s tutorials on how to do it out there. From GDAX you can sell it to get back to dollars if you wish.

Reminds me of something:
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:47:36
Too soon to say that, but I'm scared that you may be correct :(
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:46:46
Same. I pulled the trigger and bought at $10.8k on the way back up. Hope I don’t wish I waited.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:30:17
What do you mean "price discovery"? What is that?

Rate of bitcoin mining is constant. It’s 1.25 BTC/min. If you doubled the hash power, then the difficulty would go up until the 1.25 rate was restored.
Every so often there’s a halving, where the rate is cut in half from that point on. Don’t know when that’s going to happen next, but the rate *never* increases

Ok well I’m assuming the pimp doesn’t know exactly how many clients the prostitute has been with.
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:11:24
With bitcoin, nothings to stop the prostitutes from just telling the John to send the bitcoin to another secret address that only they know, and so the pimp doesn’t learn about those profits. Pimps don’t want anonymized transactions, they want big-brother-style supervision of their employees.
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:38:40
True true. I agree, bitcoin probably is a good system for them.
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:44:12
Well actually what if the prostitute overcharged the John? She could have the John pay a higher rate (assuming the John doesn’t know the real rate is lower, he’ll go along) and pay it to her personal wallet. Then she can pay to the pimps wallet just the normal rate, and she keeps the extra. The pimp sees his normal profit and sees the transaction, and assumes it’s from the John, but in reality the prostitute got some extra.
The John would have to be unaware that he was being overcharged, but I think it’s still a valid plan for the prostitute.

This seems like a terrible way to waste your bitcoin, but a possibly interesting idea would be a bitcoin-specific lottery. Smart contracts could make it work nicely. Everyone pays bitcoin into a pool and then the winner gets the pool. It’d be easy to implement.
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:30:32
Ok fair. A mole would do the trick. With that issue cleared up, bitcoin prob would be superior to cash due to easy bookkeeping.
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:59:23
Don’t mess with peoples dogs. Ever see John Wick?
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:50:37
I think what you’re suggesting isn’t possible. There’s no feasible way to let you just get the coins back unless there’s a centralized authority involved. Otherwise what would prevent you from just “taking back” your bitcoins from a totally genuine merchant who just sold you something. Coerced transactions look exactly like genuine ones, so if you could roll back one, you can roll back all.

This is an amusing mix of being off the grid and also into bitcoin
