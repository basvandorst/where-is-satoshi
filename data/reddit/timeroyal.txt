What we need is a new Bitcoin market to open up. Silkroad 3.0

“Terrorist card” ha! More like their anal “peace card” we bring you peace in the name of terror “make amaerica great again” and all their other government bullshit they spew through their media.

Zoom out on the charts this isn’t as bad as everyone believes.
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:18:20
Well if it dose that and you buy that much so will everyone else so it won’t stay that low for very long hahaha.
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:11:26
This is normal. If you’ve been debating investing for a year, you would have been following the markets right? Done the back research and seen the previous years and the percentage losses in other years right? Your $1000 is going no where. You still have all the coins you invested in no one has hacked your wallet and stolen them right? So sit tight and be patient.

Did you know when the market is stagnant, it is called a stagnant market because it like a stag that stands still eyeing its predators.

In the future of an event, where humans gain electronic implants in the brain capable of connecting with other human implants, thus transferring the internet into an organic cloud in the human brain, giving us access to abilities of electronic cross communication. The only power needed will be what our human brain creates. Thus bitcoin and bitcoin wallets will no longer live or rely on any other type of power to function, this would make bitcoin way more valuable as a asset for store of value. Gold would be to heavy to carry around....you get where I’m going with this....

If you buy at 7k you should sell at 6k
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:17:17
It’s a conundrum huh hahaha

I put buy bitcoin. But no one upvoted it so yeah ����‍♂️

I thought that said she runs a full nude. Had to have a double look.
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:04:36
Your maths dose not equate for all the other coins. Title says market that means all coin caps put together. Bitcoin dose not need to be 952k 
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:59:11
Article basically says crypto is following the same trend the dot com era had. Nothing to see here move along..
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:38:24
Listen to those of us that have been in this for a while. Buy your bitcoin first. Then buy alt coins using your bitcoin. Never buy in reverse. That’s just financial suicide....!
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:41:23
Although bitcoin is already a web currency, this is the kind of talk we need to see for full main adoption by the rest of the world. Talk like this helps the uneducated in crypto wake up and realise there is digital currency just waiting to be used.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:31:59
Oh that made me laugh XD
@_date: 2018-06-16 10:14:11
Yeah thought the Aussie dollar would be in there. Hmmm must be a fake..

Take my upvote good sir....

Or it might grow wings and fly to the moon XD

In all fairness it’s two girls one cup
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:42:20
I’d like to put out a new swing on the ding..predictions aren’t always about value adding dollar wise. Predictions are more for adoption value. If just anyone of these predictions come true then it shows how much more the adoption value is..and in the long term that’s good for all of us.
@_date: 2019-10-17 04:57:18
I know this no mystery, just seeing so many posts about 6k incoming and we like yeah we gots some ways to go before 6k

Pretty sure these memes are becoming irrelevant now, most banks are gearing up to get involved in crypto now.

Thanks for letting us know your security system, now to work out how to circumnavigate it. Well done.

Just that Dear Diary part and smile had me in stitches ��

Let's assume the best (a) and (e)....
Why because well if blockchain is still around by then bitcoin would be rare as fuck and I can buy what ever I want with my one bitcoin. Two, a loaded glock to protect myself from would be bitcoin thieves. 
Bitcoin buys everything.....
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:00:40
Is that sarcasm ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:58:45
One flaw in that vision, if fiat currency topples, then how can BTC be valued so high ��. I mean wouldn't it be worth like 500,000 yen and not USD? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:48:26
Our rides are so safe in Australia that we just don't have them full stop. ��
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:02:39
Not really ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:23:20
Well I hope so, I'll just fill my bags if it goes that low ��

Can I laugh ?

Pipe dreams hmmm... that's how BTC came about wasn't it ��
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:44:28
I know this is a BTC channel. But hasn't Digibyte been pioneering blockchain scaling with transaction speeds?
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:15:07
Good little read to lighten the mood anyway ��

All those women and young girls ( followers) about to get some bitcoin up their clacker....

What ink was used to write down the American constitution ? That seems to be doing alright. But who’s going to be around to use their own private keys in 300yrs?

After digestion hmmm that takes roughly 48hrs for digestion. I guess we could wait 48hrs :D
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:09:54
How’s this for power play. If it goes to 1 cent and you have 99.99% of all bitcoin I’ll sell you my .01% of bitcoin for 1 million dollars.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:14:14
Just hold we have been in this area before and everyone said it was going down to 3k then it went up and everyone complained they didn’t buy any or enough
@_date: 2019-09-27 06:55:06
Still it’s a working product hahaha
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:31:55
Article makes sense but that’s about it.
@_date: 2018-07-25 04:39:18
Yet you would still be retaining a lot of undigested jalapeño fibre so from a medical stand point you have not achieved full digestion until you excrete all stools containing that meal. There will be part of the Macafee Self mutilation meal to be excreted through out the remaining 48hrs XD

Value placed by the hodler
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:33:47
Lesson that’s why you never tell anyone how much bitcoin you own.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:05:37
My understand and please someone correct me if I’m wrong if you cash out from exchange to bank and it’s above 10k it gets recorded flagged and sent to who ever is the tax man. IRS for USA and ATO FOR Australia.
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:29:47
Yeah do it you only live once but it’s risky almost like jumping out a plane with a parachute 50/50 chance of success!!

He left because he got married and wanted to spend some time with his new wife. Obviously he has his priorities in order. If the man wants to take a year off to spend with his wife he’s allowed to and shouldn’t be harassed about it.

So if shitcoins aren’t valuable why do hackers hack them and steal them?
