You keep murder rates down by only counting fully solved crimes with convictions and other such trickery.
Living in the UK is much more like being in a war zone than the us. 
Outside of downtown areas at the center of the misguided war on drugs, the usa is simpler far safer. On the UK you are all victims in waiting. Having any weapon on you at all is a crime if it is intended for self defense. You arrest people for wearing scary hats, much less self defense. It's a victim culture rife with crime apologists.

They are cherries. Nice to have low priority extras, for rare or unusual attacks methods, or as backups for other flaws such a poor password rules. They are not a fundamental part of security, and provide zero protection from the majority of attacks.
Primarily 2fa is used as a substitute for good password managment, and as a wet security blanket that allows people to use insecure systems without worrying until it is too late.

Now that we have am actual payments network, it makes sense to start pushing for casual bitcoin acceptance.
It never really made sense to use a 10 minute global ledger for small purchases. A lightning transaction is cheap, instant, and low cost. 
It has only recent been appropriate to start the quest for retail adoption. The mixed witness bug really delayed launch.

Assuming his computer was infected as part of the attack, it would have prevented it entirely.
If the attack was based on a Google search word, he would have never seen it because he would only visit the site via a bookmark. 
If he somehow got confused and ended up at a phishing site anyhow, the noscript setup would have potentially tipped him off, or the other restrictions set up in firefox.

Credential stuffing relies upon poor password policy. I think you did not read my post, and you are falling for the same error as the legions pushing 2fa as if it was something important.
The credit card system is a good analogy; it is a network with fundamental security flaws, but a signature or on stripe pin  is somehow supposed to improve something. Like 2fa, it is window dressing.  
Chip and pin is an improvement  only because it introduces the first authentica to on factor, not the second. This is exactly what I told you before, but you missed it.
Im a person who designs security protocols, not an aws certified punter. Let's stop pushing 2fa, because it is only going to lead to more newbies being hacked when they trust it.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:24:36
It's much easier to discover and port a phone number than guess a username and bypass a login. If you are using sms based 2fa I would reconsider, as it is functionally worthless. Furthermore a VPN which does not require a large shared secret or private key is not safe for any deployment. Regarding password security, it is not hard to enforce uniqueness; firstly you don't allow user chosen passwords nor clear text token based auth schemes. At a minimum, consider u2f protocols.
Simply advising people to use human chosen passwords and sms 2fa is no better than telling them to pound sand.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:17:36
Not everyone was so blind. Some of us have been talking about the need for layer 2 since day one, because it is obvious. I thought companies like coinbase and bitpay would have become effective layer 2 companies instead of being the worst players at layer 1 then trying to destroy the network.
So ln is better than the future I predicted, but not fundamentally different. Large slow purchaes, like land or a yacht, make sense on l1. But coffee never did. It's just too small for the whole world to know about.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:48:55
A properly setup Linux would absolutely have prevented this.

Not really; short stability comes from popularity and use in demonization.
For saving, long term stability is more important, and you can easily see how bitcoin has an edge here. With dollar holdings you are guaranteed a slow drip loss, while bitcoin is worth at least what you bought it for after five years.
When goods, services, and contracts are written in Satoshi units, then price stability in short time periods would come for free the same way it does for the dollar. You don't usually notice changes in the value of the dollar, outside of things like gasoline prices or foreign exchange rates.

Bch is probably safe right now at 13%, but it need to hold that valuation or better to be viable. If it drops down to low single digits again, it could end with no further warning.

If you gave me a car 10 years ago, I left it in a warehouse and didn't even look at it for 10 years, then I forget which warehouse it was even in, it has nothing to do with you at all. 
Even if you taunt me that you kept it the whole time, but refuse to return it, i still have no proof to go on. Such proof is not going to be easy to get, and even a search warrant might not turn up anything..

The word mnemonic has a specific meaning.  It is absolutely not designed to be written down. 
If you want to replace the mnemonic with an easier and shorter one, a 12 word mnemonic is fairly safe, with still 128 bits of good entropy. If you resort to more primitive human chosen passwords, then you are losing most of the benefits of a mnemonic. You are reducing the strength of your system back down to brainwallet levels. Abysmal.
Your encrypted backups are subject to unbound offline attack. Common key stretching, like bcrypt, scrypt, and pbkdf2 are all available in asic form, which means they have zero value. A low entropy passphrase will not hold up to unbound attack. All it adds is a very small time delay to the attack. So a week instead of an hour.

Margin calls don't happen unless the trader runs below the capital requirements to pay their losses. So if this was a margin call someone definitely bit the bullet here. 
Also, if it was a neutral trade, it wouldn't push the price up suddenly like a short squeeze does.
The signs here indicate someone shorted btc and didn't have a deep enough stack to cover their losses, so they ended up buying a bunch of btc against their will and not getting to keep it.
Short squeezes are like bets where you bet against all hodlers, and if you are wrong all your fiat is donated to them. If you are right they have to hodl through the drop, which they would have done anyway. From what I know of hodlers, this must be the dumbest bet on the planet.

Money commodities should not have production at all.
In the short term, bitcoin simply does not have enough participation to be stable. Once the pool of people who could possibly be interested starts to dry up, then stability will increase. 
That means a very significant amount of the world's savings would have to be moved into bitcoin form before we will see such stability. In addition, liquidity must increase, as the more easily it can be traded and arbd the less large and sudden price moves will be possible

Depending on the type of work you do, it could be possible. There are a growing number of remote workers who get paid in btc for working over the internet. If they are outside the uk, you will have to deal with all you own taxes and overheads and such, essentially running your work as a consulting firm.
Today, the field is somewhat biased toward lower cost workers in less developed countries. But its also growing for the more developed areas as well.
If your major expenses and such are in gbp, you will need and exchange to regularly convert some of your earnings, and depending on your bank and exchange used you may need to provide them lots of information.
Alternatively, there are bill pay services that accept btc directly, but I don't know how reliable or convenient they are.

I think you are missing the point perhaps. 
You can jack up the params, and make it more difficult, but any inconvenience you put on yourself will be much smaller to the attacker. 
It will also give you a false sense of security, since in key stretching exercises the goal is to rotate keys before they can be attacked by the largest adversary. It's not able to prevent attacks but to delay them.
So what is your entropy budget ? Let's assume the attacker has 1gh of attack power vs your kdf scheme. What we can compute is how often you need to cycle and sweep your wallet. That's it. Each bit will buy you some seconds.
Alternatively, memorize at least 12 words and skip the while encrypted backup. Then you can keep your wallet for many years or more.

It's required for a cryptocurrency to be real. The tooling and automation of fee level adjustments allows the network to be attack resistant allows secure. For example, the fee network defending bitcoin from the bcash eda attack. Coins without a fee market are just shitcoins.

Perhaps separate the profitability calculation from the tax calculation.
It's critical in that kind if business to know if you are gaining or losing money in each activity. The easiest way to solve that is to segregate them. Sum amounts in and out and don't try to convert or equate them. Try to make sure you are net positive in each line of business and it becomes much simpler.
For example: mining - separate from everything else. Exchange enough of your earnings to cover expenses, calculate net gain or loss each period. Simple.

It's clearly obvious from the article that they found unencrypted bitcoin.
First, they recovered his datafiles meaning his computers were not encrypted and this script kiddie was no hacker.
Second, they clearly state which amounts of btc were stolen and which the police failed to steal. Surely they will try to coerce him into coughing up the rest. But mchacker probably has bad opsec and they will get it without his help.
Third, he got caught. The real question is how, but usually it means they were on to him for some time before the hammer dropped.

You are looking at it the wrong way. 
With savings you make other people's crypto worth more. This means they  can buy products raw materials or labor with this investment you made.
If the economy as a whole grows, your dividend is the deflation of crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:04:51
It's really hard to measure.
Many transactions don't represent a real transaction because the sender is the receiver. Some represent multiple transactions, like paying two different debts at once.
Most bitcoin traffic doesn't have a l1 transaction at all. On exchange trades, and intra exchange sales don't make any foot print on the blockchain. LN will exacerbate this further.
In short, blockchain stats tell us very little about what's happening with bitcoin.
The sum of block reward and fees is probably the only useful information.
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:28:31

When criminals do tumbling, especially for large amounts, they always do it over time and mixed with lots of other btc. That's why they haven't gotten caught.
And the ocean analogy is perfectly apt; the "computer" is not magic. When the utxo's are mixed they are mixed, period. Nothing can unmixed them.
Perhaps this analogy will help. Imagine a utxo is a gold coin.
Tumbling is like melting down their gold coins with other people's gold and then forging new coins from the result.
You can follow the traces in the metal, but all it will tell you is that all gold now has traces of the gold you are trying to find.
It's not hard to follow the transaction; it's just that they lose meaning.

It's your own risk you can do what you want. Hopefully they are giving you enough points to make it worth while to you.
Miners doing batch sale contracts usually use xbx or some other trusted index. There is enough trade volume  worldwide to come up with a fairly consistent pricing, and mining consortiums and otc and or retailers usually can find a mutually agreeable index.
Eliminating consumer long term deposit ls won't change that equation, because most balances are not sitting in open orders but just idle. There are day traders constantly providing liquidity too, but they usually go broke sooner or later.
Dead balances lazily left on exchanges are the main problem. They do nothing for liquidity but allow anti market results, such as fractioning and exit scams.

The last word of twelve has only 7 bits of entropy, the first 11 have 11 each. IOW you don't have to try every combination. Also, the dictionary is always 2048, the only variable is number of words.
So as I said, 128 bits of entropy is what you are trying to brute force, which is a well known size considered beyond brute force attacks. 
If there is no quantum attack possible, which in this case there likely is not, then you are probably better off trying to directly attack secpk1 ec in exposed public keys.

More entropy is always better, but I think 12 is still plenty for the lifetime of the current bitcoin curve. A 256 bit ecdsa key is considered to have a comparable strength to 128 bits symmetric anyway, so a 12 word seed is already stronger than the crypto the network is built on.

During the revolutionary war, the continental dollar was worth 1 Spanish silver dollar redeemable at the treasury.
Yet the treasury had 150 metal thousand dollars, 241 million continental dollars were issued. As people slowing realized that they were worthless, the bill was allowed to reach a natural value of zero and be written off as a tax. But people who declined to accept them during the war were punished, or had their goods "impressed" against their will regardless.

"Beanie baby collectors" are the root of all value. we need them more than any other type of users.
If bitcoin is going to enable payments, then payments customers will come eventually. If so, then the collectors will be rewarded for the service of providing value to the network.

If the amount of goods and services for sale is constant, and the amount of sound money is constant, there is no cause for prices to increase. 
If the amount of goods and services produced goes up, or their quality goes up, then the the ratio of money vs things to buy decreaes. This means prices go down and buying power goes up.

Supply is finite, and a reduced block reward chokes off the main source of ready supply. Teasing out coin from various holdings and escrow tends to cause significant price pressure.

While velocity has an effect, it is inherently self regulating.
If people delay spending across the economy, then prices undergo a temporary drop which rewards those who spend into the lull and does nothing for savers.
Likewise if prices rise due to people accelerating spending , then people who can delay spending will get rewarded with lower prices.
These two effects tend to stabilize velocity at market rates, and thus allow us to consider it a natural equilibrium. Its the same effect whether in a sound money or unsound money economy regardless.

I've spent most of my time in c and c++, everything from gui to, years of uptime network daemons, to kernel drivers.
Yes, v8 and other performance critical sections will be in c. Native crypto will be hardware accelerated. Even the regex engine is extremely optimized.
That still amounts to less than 5% of projects. Most of the time you reuse those finished bits. Once you've written a hyper optimized bezier rasterizer, you seldom write another. But you call these routines plenty of times.
Perhaps you only work on kernels, drivers, and library code, I don't know. Those are often best done in native c.
But the overwhelming majority of code is application code which waits on io nearly all the time. Node.js is the best tool for the vast majority of application logic. I very seldom need to write something in c for performance. And certainly not before I've mocked it up once or twice in a much faster to develop language and determined I need more from the iron.

My point is that it was never really backed. Not from the earliest days before the revolution, nor any of the various exceptions when it was used to fund wars. Even when individuals might have been able to redeem notes for metals in small amounts, the number of dollar bills printed always exceeded the real reserves of backing metals. Financiers such as jp Morgan were famous for minting millions with the stroke of a pen.
The paper dollar and various related banknotes have always been a float and a fraud. This is exactly why bitcoin is so significant. Metals were just too cumbersome to fill the role.

Apparently btc lenders on the polonium platform are offering unsecured btc loans with a risk of real default and not just early termination.
Normally an exchange prevents defaults by holding some amount of collateral and issuing a margin call before a default can happen.

So many people call bitcoin "high risk" but I never quite see a decent rationalization for that. 
Something is not automatically high risk if you don't understand it. If you don't understand an asset them you are simply not qualified to evaluate the risk.
In my personal assessment, I see bitcoin as a risk reduction asset. There are several systemic risks associated with cash, bank money, and brokerage assets that bitcoin simply does not share.
One of the most important aspects of bitcoin is that it is an extremely low risk savings vehicle. Short term volatility is not the same as risk.

There are far less than 17m btc on the market.

When combining two ordinals, there is also a risk someone could stack them wrong, like putting the one dot or two bar on the wrong side accidentally.
A simple 50% could use 1 two or 3 dots only, in any arrangement, to make each column a pair of letters.

Utterly false; that is only true for real inflation and hard money economies. It keynesian economics that works out false.
If you can reissue new debt without capital you are far better able to benefit from inflation than the chumps who have to pay debts out of earnings 
Cars, houses, education, these things have inflated prices due to debt. In order to afford them, people enter into debt, where as without the bubble they would not have to as the price would be lower in the first place.
Graduating college debt free is better than having 20 years of repayments. Owning a car outright is better than paying 8 times what it's true cost is over five years. Slaving away over a mortgage for ones whole life is not better than owning a home.

The theoretical limit of gold is always going up as our ability to reach it improves. With bitcoin, the full amount is available on schedule, no matter how much or little effort is used.
Gold supply is highly elastic, as mining can speed up and slow down.
Bitcoin is released on a fixed rate, which cannot be altered. It has a total supply which can never be altered.
Your model of how bitcoin mining works is wrong.
Mining is just a security service. You earn fees for crunching blocks.
It's no different than earning bitcoin for running a car wash.

I wouldn't count any monetarist or pro-fractional reserve economist as austrian. Milton friedman and the whole Chicago school flirted hard with keynesian ideas, but those are not core to ancap or austrian econ. I should be more specific and refer to sound money austrian ancap economists.
Regarding sound money deflation: the initial gain of deflation comes first into the hands of the productive. If you earn lots of money, then some other people hoarded or saved their away, then the money you earn from your productive assets increase on value. 
Unlike fractional reserve, where new value comes to the unproductive first, in a sound money economy, it comes first into the hands of the productive.
So there is no disincentive, and savings functions like an index fund.

Mined is not minted. The exact total is 21million.
The "mining" aspect of bitcoin confuses people.
It is just a temporary bootstrapping phase, as a opposed to simply assigning 100% of new coins directly to satoshi.
For newbs, it's best to ignore mining completely. It's nothing like gold mining where new gold is found.
It's just a way to bootstrap the fee market, and provide a more fair initial spread.
The 21million btc have been predetermined since day 1.
So you always know a lower bound on your share of the total btc market. No new supply can inflate your share, ever.
Liquidity is driven by price. So a miner brining coins to sell on the market is the exact same as anyone else doing it. It's just a share of the 21million and not new supply outside of the 21million

Inflation is terrible for the little guy. It increase the price of housing, and the dead loss of buying and selling is also magnified as well.
The average time spent in one house is only 13 years, so lost of up front interest is paid on an inflated price.
In the mean time, the bank simply prints money and buys the house for free, defacto owning it for nothing while renting it back to you, then dumping the debt on the government while continuing to profit by administering the mortgage.
It's nothing good for the consumer.

The trick here is that you need to be certain which index has a coin, and which words are missing.

You are still thinking on keynesian terms.
When you save, hoarde, or destroy sound money, you instantly increase the value of the remaining pool of money. So it has no impact on velocity at all. 
Since debts are low or non existent, there is no way to cause a spiral. The self reinforcing destruction of money caused by debt only comes into existence after a credit expansion, which cannot happen in a sound money market.
Likewise, the natural deflation caused by the productivity of other people does encourage savings, but that functions much like an index fund. By hoarding money, you increase the spending power of everyone else, instantly. So by gambling on the overall economy, you also invest in that economy. 
So those who do plan to invest in a productive enterprise get additional value for their spending.

Monetarism is undoubtedly keynesian. A single human can play with more than one philosophy.
Sound money Deflation is not magic wealth, it's a fair and self regulating way to allow an increase in productivity to affect a market.
You have to put keynesianism and montetarism aside to understand the theory of sound money, so let's set aside the austrian distraction.
In a sound money economy, deflation is good; it's a natural moderatator, and a fair one.
The reason the new money comes to the productive first is because they produced. If you built a new house, when you sell it the first time the market gives it the same price as the existing houses. The money does not deflate until the shock of new productivity has time to circulate. 
A person who prints a ton of inflationary money gets nearly the full pre-inflation value of that money,  because the market hasn't had time to react to the new funding. If it did, then you could never close a mortgage because the price would jump instantaneously every time you increase the loan amount
In a sound money environment the new value comes first to those who increase productivity.  It takes time for deflation to happen, so the most benefit goes to those who increased productivity.
Savers do benefit to a lesser extent, in that they are investors, but only after deflation has run its course.

Obviously listing pressure does increase fees, but an increase in the value of btc also pressures fees down. Supply and demand works both ways: high costs encourage batching and delayed txs 
Likewise, high fee cost results in vastly more incentive to use l2+
So increased price does not automatically result in a fee increase. 
You are essentially trying to say that any increase in the real value of btc would be automatically cancelled out by fee increases, which is patently absurd. Even if that as partially true, it could never be enough to  cause inflation.

It took a long time for the average person to become an Internet user, and even longer for it to be really useful.
Early in the first bubble, there was so little you could really do online, and it was much less practical than the alternatives. Most people had no idea how it would change their lives.

If you have a video from 10 years ago that had its hash included in the blockchain, then that would serve as proof that the video was at least 10 years old.  A sidechain which settled a Merkel hash on the main chain periodically would be able to affordable timestamp any number of videos or documents. And later alterations would become impossible to backdate. So it has some utility.
Once you can produce fake video streams in real time, then it really makes video much less a proof of anything regardless of the time when it was made. 
But a signed video which is then tmestamped could be proof of a statement or such. The visuals themselves would be worthless.
The whole basis of video as proof is outdated. It's no more proof of anything than an ink on paper signature.

"Goods produced" only matters if the goods are produced to a present or future real demand. For example, bomb manufacturing for government is anti economic.
When people remove hard money from circulation via saving, the remaining hard money increase in trade value, and no useless or false ventures are started via malinvestment.

It's not a bailout- noone provided new btc to make them solvent. They lost 36 percent of their held funds, fessed up, and paid it back from the own operating profit over time. To have said operating profit people had to keep doing business with them. The only reason they did not collapse is because people chose to trust them voluntarily, so there was no rush to a shutdown like with gox. Gox actually ran a fractional reserve, so they were unable to recover from a similar event.

Inflation compounds as well. It's silly to pay a degree in cash at all, even if you have the money you can easily outperform with conventional investments, much less crypto.
Getting the cheapest degree to suit your purpose, maximizing your return on investment, and earning early turns out to far outperform burning cash on an artificially overpriced piece of paper for which low interest loans are available.

Banks that work in dollars  cannot be non fractional reserve, because the dollar itself is. They cannot stop other banks from fractionally reserving and affecting it's value. They could be 100% reserve of bitcoin, assuming current regulatory barriers did not exist.
But it's impossible to sustainably fractional reserve bitcoin. That doesn't mean that can't lose their vault. It doesn't mean they can't promise to repay said losses
 It means they cannot falsely multiply their bitcoin debt balance and remain solvent.

V is self regulating. Here is another way to interpret the formula that may help you:
Money supply /  savings rate = price levels × production 
And the M of bitcoin is never going to increase from 21 million full btc. I agree that there is likely some small inflation caused by people underestimating the impact of the block reward, but it's a very small effect. The bad kind of inflation cause by fractional loans cannot happen.
People can only save so much, they have to live and eat. The can only spend all they earn, and they can only earn what they produce.
So without credit bubbles v is complete self regulating.

Lots of forces work to keep it stable. Options markets help stabilize price by evening out supply and demand, while newly mined coin roughly match new demand to hodl. 
You also have lots of newb whales hodling coin on exchanges, which are getting better at fractional reserve, which thus hurts the price.
The price will only go up when small buyers want to hold more in their personal wallets. It takes time. Also, when the dollar crashes that will help too.

You are very confused.
Deflationary spirals are not a thing without fractional reserve lending.
The rate of deflation is strictly driven by the growth of the economy,  so unproductive businesses would have an incentive to shut down or get better.
Assets don't lose value per se, unless their cost of production went down. This is common with electronics for example, but slower with land. 
Encouraging savings is very good for the economy; when people do not spend they do not consume, and that lowes prices for those who do need to spend or invest.
If too many people save and noone improves the economy, then there is less deflation and more incentive to invest. 
This reaches a nice natural equilibrium and has done so for thousands of years before fractional reserve banking.

It's really not possible to administer socialism over a rapidly changing free market. Stability, predictability, and countability are needed for the socialist infrastructure to function.
Aside from that, it's not hard to see how taxes, spending, and regulations always favor the larger firms over the smaller. 
Look at any concrete examples, such as the anti trust laws passed to "attack" standard oil and you can see how instead those laws massively favored standard oil.
Look at how state sales tax law benefits amazon. Look at how the usps subsidizes their delivieries. 
All systems of power work this way; ruling is hard. To exploit your fellow man, you need organization and regimentation. You need corporations or thing quite like them.

If you could recalculate the total human effort hours that went into the production of each big mac, it would show that less and less has been needed each year per sandwich. So the real value of the sandwich is lower in 2018 than it was in 1969.
So the real picture is even bleaker, or so I suspect.

Social ownership means government ownership. A group cannot make "social decisions" except by consensus. Beside the fact that at a certain group size consensus becomes impossible, it's not practical to poll all people over all things all the time. So a co promise, such as democracy or representatives are used instead. Thus, there is no form of socialsm without government by definition.
We don't have different definitions; you simply haven't accepted the consequences of socialist policy. There is an inbuilt contradiction in the concept of social ownership and rejection of authority. The two are incompatible.
You will notice that bitcoin is property. Ownership is not shared, and only the owner of some utxo can decide it's disposition.
Bitcoin is the antithesis of social ownership; it's is hyper capitalism.
Capitalism is in nature decentralised and anarchic. Socialism is in nature centralised and authoritarian.
Anarchy is not chaos nor disorder, and it is not without rules. Anarchy is simply the lack of central control. There can be rules, and there are, they just aren't forced on anyone.

Bitcoin is monetary freedom. That's just another way to say capitalism.
People who think something is wrong with freedom are idiots.

Asic boost is a bug, and it hurts the network. So the rational interest for the majority is to fix it. 
Increasing blocksize reduces decentralization and increases spam when it is done prematurely. The rational interest of the majority is not to increase blocksize faster than global average bandwidth.

If a full on currency war were to occur, it would be a dream situation for btc. Overnight it would be the only way to move funds between the blocked countries.

1. You use a blockchain.info wallet ??? 
2. You keep your backups on the same computer ???
3. You use apple password generation? 
4. You use icloud???
Even if you didn't lose your computer, you would have lost your money with that walletThis is 100% user error. Get your self a hardware wallet, **read**, like really read, the instructions, and follow them. Never put bitcoin related things on a Mac or Windows device, ever.
It's extremely easy to hold bitcoin at an extremely high level of security. Trivial really.
Hardware wallet with a screen, the full size trezor or ledger models.

At least you have a clear view of what you really believe. Thanks for filling out the survey and answering back with your result.
Economic authority, in my opinion is why we have such gross inequities in our current system. Socialism is a "I got mine, fuck the poor" system that is somehow sold as the opposite of that.
Economic authority is what bitcoin allows us to defeat. That means bitcoin is pure capitalism.
So you have to choose, I think, between elites and mega corps and taxes and such vs egalitarian meritocracy with bitcoin.

You can shove your private key into the root secret, instead of generating a proper random one, but you are taking a huge risk.
One way would be to - encode your 256 bit private key into a 24 word mnemonic and try to restore in some wallet that supports bip44, like a trezor wallet for example.
Expect a higher than normal chance of your whole wallet getting stolen.
