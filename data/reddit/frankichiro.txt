Without pain, is there gain?

Ehm... isn't the point of Ethereum to be a technology for handling transaction contracts, and not a get-rich-quick-scheme? I mean, if I told you to invest in VR or IoT startups, and you somehow lost money, would you say they were a scam?
Acting as a currency is just ONE of the applications for a blockchain, not necessarily the only or primary one. For BTC it may be, but in that case we need variations just like Ethereum, with a different agenda.
The very description for Ethereum is "Blockchain App Platform", and the project is actively encouraging you to build things with it, not buying things or investing to get rich.

"So I am going to suggest that he is successful not because his visions are grand, not because he is extraordinarily smart and not because he works incredibly hard. All of those things are true. The one major important distinction that sets him apart is his inability to consider failure. It simply is not even in his thought process. He cannot conceive of failure and that is truly remarkable."
"I know this because this is where we parted ways at SpaceX. We got to a point where I could not see it succeeding and walked away. He didn't and succeeded. I have 25 years experience building space hardware and he had none at the time. So much for experience."

    Do you ever think you missed an opportunity
    by not investing in Apple stocks 8 years ago?
    
    Apple Inc.
    09/01 2009	$12.94
    27/09 2009	$151.78
    
    Bitcoin
    09/01 2009	$0
    27/09 2009	$4085.80
    
    Just saying...
Bitcoin is not a commodity item. It is a revolutionary technology that will change the world forever. And I don't mean revolutionary as in "oh, it's a new thing", but int he sense of "this will actually start a revolution. There is a world before and after Bitcoin." Using it as a form of currency is just one application of it, but that alone is so revolutionary that if we were talking physics, we would be discussing Einstein's breakthrough with the theory of relativity. To put it simply, it is *a huge fucking deal*.
Bitcoin is not just another currency, it is a whole new step in the evolution of money. It is not a trend, like we've all suddenly stated to use [tulips]( instead of real money. And it is not a modern hobby like Pokémon Go. The significance of Bitcoin is more like the invention of the printing press, electricity, or penicillin. It's a revolution that will affect the whole planet and it is unstoppable.
Sure, owning Bitcoin right now is like being the first person in the world with a phone, or being on the internet when it was new. There's not a lot you can do yet, but you can be sure that there is no going back from this. Technology doesn't die, it evolves. There is only forward for Bitcoin.
If you think Bitcoin is a commodity, you have not been paying attention. Bitcoin is not the fax machine or the phone, it is the very communication technology that allows them to exist. And it's not a new currency, it is a whole new technology that allows for the transfer of value to happen in the world in a way that has never been possible before in the entire history of money and mankind.
So, asking what the value of Bitcoin is is like asking why you should invest in green energy when you have a diesel car. Sure, you can't really buy groceries or pay your bills with Bitcoin just yet, but you could not do much with stocks from Apple Inc in 1976 either.

Maybe it could be traded for food stamps or grocery coupons or something?

Actually, I meant something called meal vouchers, or [luncheon vouchers]( but I didn't know what they were called in english. We use them in Sweden, and it's basically a special currency for restaurants. You get them from your work and they can only be used to buy restaurant meals with. So, I though you should be able to buy a bundle of those with Bitcoins instead of having actual food shipped to you.
