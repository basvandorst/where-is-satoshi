It wasn't a shared send.

No lol - but thank you :)

I had found that before posting here actually :)  
That's why I had cleared my cache and cookies initially and I tried that again last night after waiting a day.
I'm trying to send more than 0.02...
I have more than what I'm trying to send...
and I have more than what I'm trying to send + 0.005 if blockchain is adding a standard miners fee.
I am kind of new at this still, but this isn't my first time using bitcoin and I tried to research... I'm totally stumped at the moment.  Googling the error message didn't result in much, either.

I used it today and had no issues, which is not exactly what you're asking - but I did get my bitcoin, so the system isn't completely broken :)
Hope that helps.

Okay.  I was able to send the money to a different blockchain wallet of my own.  I'm waiting for that transaction to confirm.
Is there a reason I was having this difficulty?  I had actually tried with two distinct receiving wallet addresses after the initial difficulty, and I got the same error message with both. 
I would like to understand this if it's possible... but either way - Thank You, vbenes :D

It's still showing "invalid send amount", I waited a day and have 298 confirmations of the money being in the wallet...

I used bitinstant successfully today.
If that helps.
