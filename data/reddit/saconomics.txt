if you need more transactions, open a checking account.  My credit union has a minimum deposit to open requirement, but not a minimum balance.  Deposit 30 and you can have a checking account, a savings account, a handy visa debit card and a few pre-printed checks.

You're thinking about it wrong.  
You should charge what the MP3 costs you for each download (zero bitcoin) then set up a tip jar.  probably much simpler and likely just as profitable.
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:26:59
It's inconvenient and expensive.  Check cashing fees and money order fees.

This, I can understand.  Sponsoring an e "sport" team, not so much.

Why don't you have a bank account?  I've never understood this.  I've had an account since I was 5 years old.

That'll get main-street to adopt it.

Probably lower viewership than the morning zoo radio show in your town.

seems more expensive to not have a bank account with cashing fees etc.  Have you ever looked in to a credit union?  Minimum balance is $5 on a savings account. I don't think I pay any fees.

good point.  I'm going to start a pog.ox
Pogs are still a thing right?

It's all about pricing for the marginal cost.  I'm too lazy to type it out, but think of it this way.  Assume that the band values the cost of producing an MP3 of their song at $1,000, they could price the download at $1,000 and sell one copy at this price, then break even.  If they produce two MP3's of the song, their cost is still $1,000 but they break even price is now $500...  (keep going until the band is producing 10,000 copies of the MP3)
Alternate model:  The cost of producing the first MP3 is $1,000.  The cost of producing the 10,000th copy of the MP3 is $0, so anything above $0 is pure profit.
Little companies like google price their products like this.

What research led you to believe that this sponsorship is the best use for the 14k war-chest?
Why not use a portion of the ad revenue for primary research? Learn where the market is in people not already exposed to bitcoin?  
What about an ad on a syndicated talk radio show?  What about a newspaper ad? Sponsor WSJ online edition?

But a very small demo which is probably already saturated.  I can't imagine a world where 70% of esport viewers (over the age of 18) weren't already aware of cryptocurrency.

this.  MT.GOX  really?  that's something to protect.  How do you even pronounce it? mount gawks?  
@_date: 2014-05-07 04:42:58
This!  Plush hackers are an extremely small minority.
I don't think UFC is the perfect choice, but it's much better than an esport sponsorship.  
What is Bitcoin's target demo? Probably 24-30 year old males with some disposable income.  I'm just guessing here, but UFC probably slants younger and poorer than the bitcoin target demo.

I get jokes.  Because the BTC block size is really 1MB and you're trying to concern-troll.

Why do you run a node?  Charity, or can you earn enough bitcoin to pay for the cost of keeping your computer running?

I can't imagine why you would trust a company with your money if this is the caliber of their communication.  It sounds like high-school drama written by a kid in the "slow" class.  
Their critique of the other "IPO" is related to the creative writing in the prospectus?
The justification for folding the entire company is that a single shareholder tried to "extort" a refund?
An "investment" like this better have 100:1 returns possible.  What am I missing?  Am I too old for bitcoin?

The entire point of this post seems to be a plea for pity or reddit charity. Very specific info about the purported loss, but no information here or advice. The conspiracy theorist in me thinks that op was the seller and buyer in the original transaction. DOWNVOTES!
