Clearly you have never read Herodotus, lol. That is the most long winded ramble I have ever pushed through. One paragraph of the story, 50 page digressions, 25 page digression of the digression, back to the story for a paragraph, oops forgot about this 50 page digression. It reads like asking an ADD 8 year old to describe his weekend. Fucking hell that guy needed an editor.

Could be a small problem this is one of the more important ones that you needed, do you have a bank statement that shows them being drafted? Were you super stoked and posted some shit to FB about "bought my first bitcoin?" Like I said, anything that can provide a date is key, otherwise you can file with what you believed you purchased them at, however the IRS can say.... No bullshit prove it.... Now what should happen is that mt gox should send out a statement indicating what you bought and sold and when and at what price (this is how an etrade does it) without this you can, make a best guess, hope you are close and then hope the IRS just passes you by, and honestly if you're talking very small amounts &lt;1000.00 then you could be lucky enough to fly under the radar. 


YEAH..... remember me telling you the US Tax Code is complex.... You just fucking hit a BIG ONE!!!! Honestly I have never dealt with this I focus more on audit than tax and the rules for it are COMPLEX AS SHIT!!! Honestly what you will probably need to do is find a local CPA, (seriously we don't charge that much) and allow him to file for you. The reason this is nice is because you are going to 1) have suspicious transactions- maybe 2) are from a foreign state 3) have sold and purchased an asset that you may/ may not be able to justify, 4) I'm sure your going to have some earning from your home country to claim as wages here, but if you already paid a tax in the home country you would qualify for a deduction. This is a recipe for an audit, and at least with a CPA behind you, its his firm and his license on the line, and the IRS tends to give CPA's the benefit of the doubt. Not to mention the fact that if something does go wrong there is always the chance the US "could" try to revoke your visa. So grab that phone book and start calling around son lol. If you think your getting fed some bullshit or what to know if its a good price let me know and I'll definitely hook you up there.

Oh and tomorrow I will start preparing a private letter ruling, it will take some time and it is not "100%" official but it will allow us to shine some light on this topic, and it will at least provide some insight to how the IRS may view these type of transactions. 
Edit: I want to get with a co worker of mine who is MUCH better at tax than me, I prefer audit.

Holy shit I just realized I typed out that entire long ass reply and didn't answer your question appropriately. Did you repurchase the coins within 30 days of your initial sell (Wash rule I was talking about below) if yes, then no. If no, then Yes. 
Also we have a few other considerations here. Do you have any statements or back up showing how much you bought them for and sold them for and then re bought them for? This is going to be key.... Please say yes, please say yes.....  
Edit: also don't think all is lost, and your going to get double fucked by gox and the IRS like I said in the first post you can carry the loss forward to offset gains in other years. In fact this could actually help you more than it hurts you in the long run. However in the short run you could wind up paying for the gains and then getting to take the losses in subsequent years, so that sucks, but first things first. Find some proof of your initial investment, your sale, and your reinvestments, anything is better than nothing. Even a reddit post or comment that says "yep I just repurchased with Gox" I can work with the flimsily of evidence so try to find something...  
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:37:51
This is one of those reason why you never pull all nighters while giving out tax advice, and good for you for double checking, I was completely backwards when referring to the wash rule. Holy shit I think that's the first time I've ever done that, terribly sorry. In this case you will pay the capital gains tax, on the initial sale if you sold for a profit, and the wash rule is applicable to losses

Thanks for the tip bro, yeah keep me posted, 300 seems a touch high, I currently bill 150 an hour for an audit. So it could be he's expecting a couple of hours, since your tax situation is so unusual. Btw if you don't mind telling me how much in bitcoin profit are we talking? The worst the IRS could do would be to say "okay, you can't prove what you initially bought them for we are going to assume you bought them for a penny". Trust me you're not the only person whose bookkeeping sucks. I have clients that will hand me a shoe box of receipts and go "here". I had one client who we were doing a first year audit on, her husband had died, and he was the owner/bookkeeper, she cleaned out his office and "threw away a bunch of boxes in the corner"... yeah she threw away 20 years worth of financial records, that was by far the worse case I had ever seen, it took us monthes to recreate the records. So don't feel to bad about it. All in all worse case scenario you got popped with an audit, the IRS is really not that bad, they get a shitty rap, but I've dealt with them many times for our clients, and never had an issue. But just so you know they have 4 types of notices they can send, a information "hey dude, we think you forgot x please send it to us, a office notice "hey why dont you come to our office and have a seat", a field visit "hey we will be dropping by, and a field vist with a special agent. Information audits are 99% of them usually you or the cpa did something silly like list a date of birth wrong, or forgot to include a w2, if you get one bring it to your CPA let him handle it. I've only been through the first two, the office visit, just more detail and maybe they want to double check some receipts. The important thing is DO NOT IGNORE THEM, THE IRS IS COOL UNTIL YOU BLOW THEM OFF. Oh and if yoh get the forth type "with special agent" call your CPA and then a lawyer cause it means they are probably going to charge you with a crime. Don't let that freak you out. I've seeb some fucked up client records, in fact the office visit was due to a new client that hadn't filed taxes in over 6 years...lol so imagine how bad you have to fuck up to get a "with special agent" notice... that's like madoff or mt gox type shit seriously.

@_date: 2014-02-28 08:22:09
okay I read the instructions and looked at some other info (keep in mind its 130 in the am here) and here is my opinion, no... but.... 
So the way I read it if a company is HQ in the US and you are holding money in a foreign sub, or if it is a foreign sub and you are holding money in a us branch, the answer is no. 
Now where this gets tricky, if mt gox is a foreign company which it is and your money was held in a foreign account, yes.... So really it depends on how mt gox is structured and where your money was being stored, I have no idea how to find that out, I think gox would be the only ones to know this. 
However the rules are 50K in value for single 100K for married so I'm thinking this will not affect tons of people
However if it does affect you I would advise seeking a lawyers help, the FBAR/FATCA is fairly new and there is not a lot of lit. on it yet, and compound this with the natural complexity that is bitcoin and multiple that by the complexity that is the IRS and I honestly have no clue.... Don't you just love accounting answers lol 
 
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:59:45
I just realized how long this reply is.... My bad I'm bored its late so I went a little overboard, I provided examples of about every type of capitol gains/loss tax I could think of, so don't feel like you have to read it all, if you want to have fun. lol If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask.  


typically speaking that's your best bet, the IRS and the government are much nicer to people who are open and honest and don't make them work at finding things, if you're below the threshold 50K-100K, you can still self report and the IRS will basically say "thanks but we didn't need it". Additionally we will use certain forms to make voluntary discloses of transactions that might look suspicious to someone who didn't know what was going on, these are pretty helpful to, you basically write an essay saying "hey X looks funny and here's what it is, here is how we handled it, based on Y in the tax code if this is wrong Mea Culpa" 
Oh and the reason most people don't go to jail over taxes is because in accounting "intent" is the key word. So if you disclose everything up front it can never be said you were operating with "intent to deceive", now you will probably wind up paying more over time then somebody who likes to keep things hidden, but when it counts you will certainly come out ahead.... IE not in a federal pen.     


Fortunately the answer is No, and I'm sure of this one....lol you are allowed to deduct capital gains from losses, now here is where it gets tricky. 
Captial gains come in two types: 
Short term: Held for less than a year 
Long term: Held for more than a year
Not to bad so far but this is the US tax code so you KNOW shits about to get CRAZY!! 
Here's the deal your **short term gains** (&lt;1 year) are taxed at your **ordinary income tax** rate that can be anywhere from 10%-39.6%
Your **long term gains** (&gt;1 year) are taxed at the **capital gains rate** which is either: 0,15, or 20%. 
Oh we haven't even touched the crazy yet...lol. I'm going to adjust your example some to give you some different scenario's. 
1) You bought bitcoins 10 at 1/1/2012 for 200 ($2000) and sold them 1/1/2013 for 400, ($4000), in this case you have a capital gains tax on 2000, at 0,15,20% as the principle is never taxed. changing it slightly and lets say you sold at 12/31/2013 then it would be a short term, and handled just like I said above.
2) You buy bitcoin 10 at 1/1/2012 for 200 ($2000) you sell them on 1/2/2012 for 400, ($4000), on 1/3/2012 the price drops back to 200 and you decide to reinvest your 4k. In this case you qualify for the "Wash Rule" and wouldn't pay any taxes. (the wash rule can be tricky and if this applies to you let me know and I'll provide more detail) 
3) You buy bitcoins (we will use the same amounts from above to save me from retyping it) on 1/1/2012, on 5/1/2012 the price tanks, you panic and offload your coins for a loss of 500.00. In this case you can deduct the losses from your ordinary income (up to 3K per year 1500 for married filing separate (total side bar but if you do MFS, make sure you need to cause you get dicked hard!!!!)) 
4) You buy bitcoins 1/1/2012 and sell 1/1/2013, for the same gain as before. You decide to up the ante and after 30 days (the wash rule is not applied after 30 days) you reinvest the money, the price shoots up again and you cash out 5 days later and make 10K in profit in this scenario you would be taxed
Long term: 2000 original investment - 4000 profit = 2,000 taxable captial gains 
This would be due in tax year 2013 as you "realized" the gain that year, IE sold 
Short term: 4000 (since the tax was paid on the other 2000 as capital gains you don't pay it again)-10k = 6K profit short term and gets hit with the short term rate. 
Again this is due in tax year 2013 same principle as above. 
See we are getting to the crazy very quickly. So far we have only seen gains now lets mix in the losses. 
5) So 1/1/2012 same numbers before, 1/1/2013 you sell, 5/1/2013 you decide to reinvest, but this time it doesn't do jack, come 5/1/2014 and somebody hacked the protocol (impossible I know, but work with me here) and now your investment is worthless. In this case you have a long term gain and a long term loss 
So the long term gain is the same as above and its due in 2013, even though you reinvested your money, it was after 30 days and the wash rule doesn't count. So you better hope you have some extra money to pay the taxman. (trust me people fuck this up all the time and it can be costly).
However in 2014 your loss of 4k (remember you paid the tax on the 2k gain in 2013), will be deducted from your wages, however the maximum allowed deduction for losses is 3k in any year, however instead of losing the 1K in deductions you can "carryforward" the loss. I think carryforwards can go for a max of 20 years. 
Now lets roll it all together, 
6) 1/1/2013 you buy 100 bitcoins at 200 (20k) you sell them at 2/1/2013 for 30K (10k short term gain), you repurchased them on 4/1/2013 the price was 200 again (still 30k just more coins this time), and this time you made a bad call and sold them when the price was at 5 (750.00). Also during this time you finally sold some old stocks (more than a year) you were holding for a gain of 1000, additionally you found some old bond certificates to a company called enron and you were able to cash those in for a loss of 4K all in all it was a shitty year for you. 
Here we go.... In this case you have:
A short term gain of 10K
A short term loss of  29,250
A long term gain of 1000
A Long term loss of 4000. 
Now the way the IRS handles this crazy cluster fuck is by the following: Long term to long term first 4000-1000 so a net long term loss of 3000
Now we apply the long term to the short term
10 - 3K long term -29250 short term = 22250 net loss, 
In this scenario we would pay zero taxes on the gains and be able to deduct an additional 3K and be able to roll the remainder over to the next years until the amount was fully spent. 
So I didn't mean to give you that much info but its late and I'm bored (obviously), so hopefully I didn't lose you through any of that. However now you should a good understanding of why tax professionals (especially the really good ones) make so much money. Not just because the code is needlessly complicated, but because by planning out your gains and losses properly you can save a boat load of money, and failing to do so can cost you MASSIVE amounts. There are times when a client is holding a bankrupt stock for YEARS, before selling it, so that he can pair long term to long term and save some money in the process, in fact some accountants are so good at this shit they do whats called "harvesting" which is basically buying stocks, bonds, mutal funds, that are overpriced just so that you can sell them when they fall for a tax benefit. If the stock goes up oh well you made money, if it goes down you get to write off the value of the purchase so who cares, its basically like playing with house money.... 
So yeah accounting is awesome, we get to make these crazy ass rules, charge people to interpret these crazy ass rules, and if we interpret them wrong we get to charge to defend the client in court, so its a freaking WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN for us, its like a license to steal....lol

Nope, you have to realize the gain "cash out" 
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:42:43
I've been wondering the same thing. Is it possible that's the reason for delay from purchase to delivery?  You're at least the thrid or forth person who has had yhis problem
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:50:04
You mean like inflation ??? Lol
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:19:57
Nope no tax. In fact you could claim the 25 loss, but since you have no gains you wouldn't be able use the deduction
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:43:40
Yes as 10k transactions have to be reported and you can bet amazon follows the tax code. Also that does kinda work, until the means audit. IE the irs goes to your neighbors friends family etc..and they start talking about your nice new IKEA sofa, and the agents don't see in 1000+ transactions.... this is how mobsters get caught
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:26:58
Lol that is one way, but means testing will show it up. IE your bank balance hasn't changed in 5 years but you're not dying from starvation. Or a 21 year old teacher driving a Porsche, etc...

Hmmm... are you showing a 1 btc bal? I'm wondering is there a way to confirm the transfer to your account?  Or are they "showing" you a number of BTC, that they may not even own?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:05:47
No actually that just makes it worse. A ton of people hold, correction goes to 600, and holds stable, people think the worst is over and pump it again. Rinse and repeat and that's why bubbles get So big. The real determination is underlying value. IE if people and businesses start transacting in bitcoin, that will stablize the price, some.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:02:31
Yep and totally blindfolded. Lol. Best advice ever, you can either feel stupid before the peak or after your choice...lol

Shouldn't that speak against the current valuation?  I mean the twitter valuation is based on current users and the ability to monetize it. Bitcoin is the cart pulling the horse. It has value "guessing" that people will use it. Its a lot harder to attract investors then it is to keep them.

Just to piggy back this can be done, but some really, really smart people have tried and been busted. It works fine for small amounts but more than about 20% of your taxable income (probably much less) and you're asking for trouble.

@_date: 2013-11-19 05:36:03
You can do that and help destroy bitcoin if you want to. Uncle Sam is a greedy bitch and if he thinks he losing money, you better believe he will take action. Online poker was bigger than bitcoin and they have done a decent job shutting it down. Silk road was "anonymous " and they still found the "creator". Once you're on the radar the feds will be content to sit back and wait. One unusual transaction, one slip and that's it. Have you used any of the exchanges ever? Cause if so you already made mistake one. I would be willing to bet campbx, coinbase, et al could be compelled to turn over there records.
