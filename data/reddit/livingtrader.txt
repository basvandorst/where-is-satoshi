I am hurt and saddened by both the transaction speed and acceptance. This is at best a replacement for SWIFT international transactions and Banks are now starting to use Ripple as a cheaper alternative. So the future is definitely not looking very bright in the current form. Needs evolution. Ether has definitely evolved better for now

The high is a relative number !! 
The issue is you are equating it with the Fiat !! Look at the transaction cost as a percentage !! 
Having said that this will burst as an asset bubble like any other before make its way to our daily lives ;(

Yeah so God damn true.. We bloody exchange bitcoin among ourselves and claim a stupid value to it... Extremely disappointed.
I want to see acceptance and us making efforts to put it out there to the world than keep exchanging and speculating on it.

This is supposed to be a medium of exchange and not what people accumulate and hide in their wallets

You create value for anything only when we put it out there for use. Build a market and acceptance before we lock them up. Unlike gold which could be used for making tangible things crypto is created expending energy. It's not a commodity like gold so it needs acceptance to get value than anything. That's all is my case. I
 will continue to transact in crypto where possible to increase acceptance that's all my case it.

The value of a currency increase when you spend it !! If you are hoarding it then it is no more than bullshit kept in a locker.. has no value or meaning. 
Thank you all for spending it and exchanging it to get it to where it is now !!! Cheers

So did you get the credits? We are sure you would have... Ofcourse assuming you put the right address 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:33:30
yeah thats exactly the point.. .as crypto does not have an underlying intrinsic / use value we need to create it by make it available and exchangeable.. Cheers
