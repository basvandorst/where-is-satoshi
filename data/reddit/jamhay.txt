Snakes like this guy will probably try allude to a handful as justification... instead of just having the balls to admit they were wrong.
Crypto m/cap has almost tripled since his tweet... far from "bust for good" as he put it. 
His projection here is definitely/ unarguably wrong. He knows it as replies to comments have since disappeared.
These predictions tend to make it on to wiki pages along side all the more accurate predictions.

Some really good counter arguments appears most of the consensus is that that Bitcoin is unrivaled/ unstoppable. I get it, I own Bitcoins and always found it easy to talk them up.  But having to buy more at $700+ each does make me question it more... like:
 - what are the true benefits of owning it now 
 - is what I'm buying really unique and going maintain that quality sentiment in future, like Gold/ Silver?
 - can it or its format be copied or replicated?
 - can it be bettered?
At todays price, I think merits a few more questions being asked of Bitcoin and its future...
  
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:32:24
The first revolutionary prototype in history, is typically the last to succeed. If we stopped at the first design of the wheel, doubt you'd have a comfortable ride today you can apply that to nearly any game changing innovation. I reckon Bitcoins biggest flaw could very well be that it doesn't allow for forthcoming competition. It assumes its the absolute and not the exception. What if tomorrow a blockchain tech was somehow released in a mobile/ cell format, then smartwatch after that. Smaller more nimble gathering faster adoption. Many seem to have a blind belief that the current variant of blockchain technology and bitcoin wont be adequately challenged and continue to appreciate, however everything in the history of technology tells us the exact opposite actually happens.  
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:00:47
I reckon thats going to happen, but by the time it does, Bitcoin may very well be the 5th most popular crypto potentially with a value of only $500 dollars a coin and many miners might have given up.
@_date: 2016-06-20 15:19:18
I think the human mindset may prevent that somewhat in the end BitcoinFuturist. Many people often want to own the whole and not a part of something, and dare say thats true of Bitcoin and at the moment a full Bitcoin is becoming pretty expensive for your average Joe. If someone offered half a BMW or a full Tesla for half the cost of the BMW, I think most would opt for the Tesla. Bitcoin is nice, but personally think as the price per bitcoin climbs as high as its doing, the average person will start looking elsewhere?

Thats if you think Bitcoin is going to maintain the same same tier ranking as gold, there are and will be many cryptocurrencies and in the future. I think there could be better cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin, many that function better, quicker with more use cases and better mainstream adoption. There will only be one Gold. I'm saying that quite possibly in the future that other cryptocurrencies may leapfrog Bitcoin, and its value decrease to that of tin (or a BMW) compared to that of Gold (or a Tesla). 
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:57:24
I wouldn't have said so, by their very essence blockchain and bitcoin are technologies first before they are a store of value. They are potentially sitting ducks just waiting to be out innovated and go out of fashion. Its extremely unlikely that tin will ever rank ahead in value compared to gold. You cant really say that will be the same for the likes of Ethereum Vs Bitcoin or whatever comes next. Sega had years on the Sony PlayStation, greater adoption and far larger market share.... Sony still won....

It's a bridge... one of the biggest FUD points was you can't spend crypto easily anywhere, but now you can everywhere. 
Yes the fees are quite expensive but the way some cryptos move if they jump up 10% in a day it's a good way to take a little realtime profit.
Also hopefully coinbase reinvest the fees to eventually roll out a merchant scheme to enable a direct coinbase wallet to merchant payments. 
Coinbase are one of the few companies that could end up giving Visa, Mastercard and PayPal a run for their money so let's hope they keep working in the background on longterm direct merchant adoption.

I've been around since the early days... at the end of day bitcoin has been a huge trail blazer  and is still massively successful considering its age and all the disagreements/ challenges it's had and faced. 
It still works, it's still decentralised, it's still safe it's still better than fiat.

Nobody really uses any crypto for payments at the moment.  
Most peeps are still in the long term "investment" hodl mindset until mass merchant adoption.... and nothing wrong with that.
It took decades for credit card payment infrastructure to reach mass adoption as well and it was a relatively straightforward step in mindset and understanding. 
It will come, but it had only really stated to grab mainstream headlines and attention in the past year or so, before then most were still blindly fudding it. 
Give it time.

So what if you had a very loose creative commons form of copyright on the word "Bitcoin" basically saying that everyone is free to use it however if it's used in the title of a fork then the Bitcoin community of users/ owners or anyone are allowed to collectively apply to courts/ websites to have it removed?

Crypto is just another evolution of exchange/ store of value which will be phased in over time.
Before fiat notes and coins we had gold and silver.  When they were withdrawn as legal tender the world didn't end, as with trading goods such as tea and goats before then.  
Most just blindly use fiat without question and just perceive it to have intrinsic value. 
What's an easier question to answer accurately:
1. How many fiat coins or notes have been minted/ are in circulation in your country? 
2. How many digits are in people's bank accounts in your country?
3. How many Bitcoins have been mined/ are in circulation in the world?
I know which one I have most faith in and at the end of the day value of any currency comes down to faith.

Bitcoin has an anonymous creator who doesn't try to sway community opinion or consensus. 
Bitcoin also a higher miner adoption threshold.
This is the thing, the creator Charlie Lee calls for changing the way Litecoin fundamentally works and the miners listen (like segwit). That's not the way Bitcoin works and the more times this is done the less the currency becomes  "Bitcoins Silver" which has been the sales pitch from the start. Litecoin needs to match Bitcoins evolution to be its equal Silver counterpart. So Bitcoin is the true gold of crypto &amp; Litecoin is morphing into something other than its Silver.
