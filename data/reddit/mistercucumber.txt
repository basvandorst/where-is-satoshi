Technical analysis is great as a supplementary tool to understand where the market is headed but it does not give you answers nor insights on the technology itself

no one directed any insults at you, jeez, mister insecurity over here, calm down, i never said "i know shit" in fact i came to this sub with the hope of gaining more knowledge, now, in this specific comment I am directly calling you a dumb fuck, go fuck yourself

Thanks for the feedback, its called dumb money for a reason

could you tell me how you managed to do that?
I have a friend who sent bitcoin to bch address on COSS exchange and we are not sure how to get it back, if you have any useful info on that i would greatly appreciate it!
Thanks in advance

Thank you, that is true, i did not think of it that way

if you're doing this in the states, there's a very high chance you're gonna get rekt because you're handling peoples money and as such you have to follow a lot of the regulations of a money service

maybe because it was greater than 10000 and it was my first deposit but regardless that doesnt seem like a valid reason if they had never mentioned that it would be a problem

what does "reasonable time" mean exactly because depending who you ask with regards to customer support that varies a lot

Actually, nothing is up to the client when dealing with kraken customer support, we are left at your mercy with no reasoning as to why we are facing the problem and no estimated response time, could be 1 day could be 5 weeks from what i have seen on other threads

I have already escalated my ticket and even created a thread in the krakensupport subreddit, is there anything more that can be done to expedite this process?
