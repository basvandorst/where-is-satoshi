If this is true why does it seem some users had to go through a sign up process with BitGo and now have a username and password with them, and some users never did anything with BitGo?
Did some users get migrated to their own BitGo wallet automatically but don't have BitGo credentials to look at their wallet?

Omg totally lost it on that line. Funny af

So the tokens are worth $1 in the sense that Bitfinex has to give the owner $1 for each of them at some rate and at some point in time.
The trading is part is basically figuring out the when and how much and setting what that's worth to you to wait.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:38:36
Wow holy shit that's crazy. We need details on how this happened. The attacker had to have access to all the private keys for all the wallets, plus the addresses themselves, plus the bitgo api key. I mean its just mind boggling someone could get ahold of all that
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:48:00
Does anyone have the actual terms and conditions?
According to the blog:


This would limit it to each paying customer up to 250k.  In this case Bitfinex users are not paying customers, bitfinex would be the 1 paying customer and only eligible for 250k.

Exactly, that TOS is fine in regards to trading.  All of that is boilerplate stuff for trading platforms.  However it doesn't give license  for the CEO to just take the money and deposit into his own account, or in this case cover theft from incompetent security practices.

*Was* a whale, before the coins he lucked out with from his mining rig back in 2010 were all lost through Bitfinex incompetence.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:19:34
Exactly, there should be no losses at all until bitfinex has applied every dollar in their accounts and every bitcoin they own into returning as much of the stolen property as possible
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:10:18
Did BFX move all the coins already?  I held no coins so I wouldn't see any activity.  Anyone who already checked BitGo and knows their coins weren't stolen should be able to tell when they are moved.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:52:48
Exactly, just saying may be redeemed for shares in the future is not good enough.  Saying these will be turned into a piece of the company based on valuation from neutral 3rd party is the only acceptable answer.

There is no way the legal definition of paying customer would extend to customers of an exchange with no direct line item of money devoted to that service.
In fact I think it is likely the blog post (and presumably the T&amp;C) were written this way specifically to exclude deals with other companies that aren't direct customers of bitgo.
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:34:51
I'm fairly calm.  I applaud the effort they have made to communicate so far and come up with a fair decision.  I think the decision to socialize losses is wrong from a fairness standpoint, but given if they didn't there is a 100% chance they would be forced into bankruptcy I agree with the decision from a business perspective.
They are doing fairly well -- it has been enough time I would hope they start giving details on the actual hack itself as well as what I mentioned above about spelling out now what portion of the company my BFX is worth, otherwise they will continue months and years down the road dodging liability for these losses while working out an exit strategy for themselves.
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:39:06
That's a good question regarding cftc and why they did this in the first place.  It seems Zane might have mentioned elsewhere that only the "Exchange BTC wallet" was at BitGo
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:48:02


They have lost their insurance


 All indications are that bitfinex was hacked and BitGo's system operated as it was designed with Bitfinex


BitGo's only reason for being used here was to protect Bitfinex, not the users.  I don't know for sure, but based on their comments I'm fairly certain the custom agreement/implementation with Bitfinex did not have any of these protections


They had no limit


All that was needed was Bitfinex private key, the way the system was setup was to sign as long as bitfinex asked for it (again this was setup to protect bitfinex, not the customer)


This right here is the correct question.  BitGo basically sold out here, agreeing to a non-standard implementation with Bitfinex that was designed to protect Bitfinex and not the users because of whatever money Bitfinex offered.  Bitgo can say all day they lived up to their contractual obligations, and I'm betting legally they are in the clear.  But their reputation will be tarnished, and rightfully so because they damn well knew this could happen, and likely informed Bitfinex it could.

I did not deposit USD for the purpose of lending to speculators.  I deposited USD for the purpose of using it as collateral for my own speculative trades, none of which were open at the time of this attack.
The TOS also states that USD are held in a bank and FDIC insured


@_date: 2016-08-04 21:50:30
FYI what I mean by setup to protect Bitfinex, not the customer, is straight from the Bitfinex TOS


TLDR; BitGo's sole responsibility to Bitfinex users is to freeze a wallet if so requested by the user, everything else is to protect Bitfinex, allowing them to offload responsibility for the wallet onto users, but not allow them to transfer out the funds if there is some disagreement/lien with Bitfinex
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:12:42
If you only planned to sell for cash why didn't you just use coinbase? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:30:33
It might be true that Bitfinex could dig up a 3rd key, but contractually between you, bitfinex and bitgo, they have agreed to allow you to freeze the wallet which can then only be opened by arbitration.  (according to TOS).  So I would think freezing it would give you a bit more of a legal leg to stand on
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:35:33
I think it is pretty clear by reading the bitfinex TOS that the only purpose in using BitGo was to protect Bitfinex, and nothing at all to do with protecting users wallets.  I'm fairly certain they had it setup to bypass most of BitGo's services and were only using them so that users could have their own wallets but not make off with the funds if there was some kind of dispute/lien with Bitfinex.


This spells out leaving completely no doubt that BitGo has no other responsibility to bitfinex users than to put a hold on the wallet if it is requested.
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:37:45
A while back when logging into Bitfinex US customers were forced to go create a BitGo account and wallet.  During that process you created a login and password to BitGo.  If you didn't do this then you don't have a BitGo wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:57:12
This is what I figured would happen.  Synapsepay is FDIC insured, if those funds go missing someone would have to pay.  Honestly this is how it should be for everyone with USD funds.  So those who hadn't been moved to Synapsepay yet just get screwed for no reason.
So the question is did Bitfinex exclude them from the calculated pool when they considered the haircut?
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:33:22
Dude, if I were you I would login to bitgo and tell them to freeze your wallet, making it so that bitfinex can't simply do what they want with your coins

I held only fiat there, purposely and specifically because I felt it safer than holding in bitcoin.  I will not agree to fund part of your losses.

Unfortunately the blog post states "All of BitGo's **paying** customers"
Bitfinex users are not paying for the service.
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:12:46
Ya if you never signed up your coins wouldn't be in a multisig wallet with BitGo so there is no freeze option.  Has anyone confirmed if coins were only stolen from BitGo wallets?

Why is this superior to 2FA?  There is no way a hacker can login as you unless they have your device.
The fixed address is also a bigger inconvenience than 2FA, because many places you might want to send your coins to (like coinbase) generate a new wallet address every time you deposit money.
@_date: 2014-10-16 08:51:09
Read through all the chat transcripts. Honestly the only 2 things robocoin did wrong was attempt to collect a restocking fee, and not refunding the money promptly.  
The rest of the exchange/delays/etc were unfortunate, but honestly Andrew was by far the worst offender.  The machine was constantly disconnected from the internet and Andrew was just doing things on his own schedule, bitching about the UI (cause that's his thing), and putting blame on a guy who had nothing to do with the trouble. 
If Andrew displays that same level of professionalism with his own clients he's not going to be in business long.  Robocoin on the other hand handled a bad situation mostly correctly.

I just think it's funny they would even bring it up in the bill, and then end with the Dark Fantasy bit, pretty funny
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:50:44
Lol is this really in the bill?


          COINYE (Originally called COINYE West) which was modeled after  
          Bitcoin and implied a connection to rapper Kanye West via a  
          cartoon picture of Kanye West as the currency's logo.  A lawsuit  
          filed in a Manhattan federal court sought to stop COINYE on the  
          grounds that it used the rapper's image to cash in on his  
          popularity without his consent, damaging his reputation and  
          confusing consumers about the source of the cryptocurrency.
 &gt;         Facing legal action, creators of COINY have ended the project  
          and COINYE is now Lost in the World, but may have been nothing  
          more than a Dark Fantasy.

Great Job Andreas.  I've watched your interviews sporadically over time and getting better each time, culminating with this hearing you've done an excellent job of whittling down the talking points to the most succinct and direct they can be as well as using exactly the right amount of technical detail and not getting needlessly bogged down in the areas that raise the nerves of misunderstanding people.
I don't know if Ive ever watched the entirety of one of your previous videos, and ive definitely never watched the entirety of a senate hearing, but I listened to every minute of that one.  
You are of great value to the community and the technology, a new "bitcoin foundation" should be started with you at the center.

@_date: 2014-01-15 04:49:06
Hmm that's interesting.  That seems like a serious design flaw in the entire protocol.  If it's more profitable to share computing power to ensure you almost always get the block and share the profits than to go alone, it only encourages more power to join the most powerful pool which would take over 50% of the network.
I mean mathematically it should always work out to the same mined amount over a long period but the larger the pool the steadier the income.

@_date: 2015-08-17 01:48:10


No they aren't.  They are making a client available, the people who run the software are deciding by deciding to use that client.  You can make a new client today and put it up on GIT, does that mean you are deciding?


What are you talking about?  This is exactly why the system was designed like this, so no central authority would get to decide the rules.  The rules are determined by the majority of power in the system.  Remember the 50% problem?  It's a problem because if one entity gets more than 50% of the power they can change all the rules to whatever they want.
