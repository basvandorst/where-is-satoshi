thanks, and sorry. Just apologised to each of the three peeps kind enough to point out the rules for me before deleting.

oops sorry
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:37:02
how about you tip some one else.

I'm only new to bitcoin and some of these posts are really worrying. I was looking to make my first purchase through localbitcoins. Is it experiencing problems?

What if a lady would like to be tipped? 
I come from a burlesque performance background and I was actually thinking it would nice to put on a show and be tipped.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:34:32
Yeah he knows what's up.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:31:40
I'm still working it out myself

I had a different account I used to tip with. I tipped in the wrong subreddit and got downvoted for "bringing the ponzi coin in here".
Tldr, auspol will have none of it. I still tip, but sorry guys not there.  I hope they verified though, it was about a month ago.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:06:20
That's a great idea!
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:18:32
ok, didnt seem to work - can some one help me? I got tipped 20cents so i shoud be able to send 10cents to opoipo.

Sounds like a scam.
You have to leave money in there to get the bonus. You can "withdraw anytime" by they are very keen for you to deposit and walk away.
Let's just say the last time I got a deposit bonus, it was from eobot. Which they then took back. Before eventually returning my deposit and leaving me coinless. It just feels acammy to me.

Will this sub be sec-beginner friendly?
Before bitcoin, I rarely thought about security. I'm not familiar with all the terminology and techniques. Will this sub be accessible to people like me or is it more for people confident enough to handle their own security?

I just got my first tip, I will halve it with you! (If this works- let's find out)
+u/bitcointipbot $0.10 verify
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:30:05
Thanks so much. 
Fuck it, have the other half
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:29:09
+$0.10 verify
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:03:10
agreed, more visibility is important.
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:53:48
This is true.

Smart rappers have always diversified. Snoop is smart as, look at the career he's had. But it's not just him, didn't someone from wutang clan tweet about it about a month ago?
If I could just work out this tipping thing I'd send him some coin just to see if he's using it or holding it, but in truth he's probably doing both.
