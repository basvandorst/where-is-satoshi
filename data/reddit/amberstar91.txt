I'm so sorry for your loss...
Hindsight is a bitch. It's not just with money, but with everything in life. It's easy to look back and beat yourself up over it but please don't. Please forgive yourselves for whatever decisions you made and *remember* that you did the best you could at the time.  You sold early but at the time you were making the decision, it suited you.  You were happy with it, and that's all that matters.  It's sad that you lost out of the riches you could've had but you did your best.
And please, seek counselling if it plagues you.  Mental health is important and bitcoin is a fucking rollercoaster.

Where were you all weekend? I made 0.01 BTC off that. Isn't a lot but I made some stupid decisions and almost lost £600 so I'm really pleased to be in net + again.

Just got my Xmas bonus.  Gonna cash out what little profits I have left of BTC right now and cross my fingers it drops right down to €5k or something, and then I'm innnn
That's assuming GDAX doesn't screw me over and go down and prevent me from trading like it did a couple of days ago :')

I pretend I'm a holder but I quite like a gamble so.....
Need to step away from my wallet &gt;__&lt;

Ah shoot, you're right.   I'm getting my knickers in a twist over the premium.  Just seems extortionate but I think that's on me to find a cheaper exchange. Thanks

I'm a n00b to this bitcoin stuff but sought this subreddit out in the hopes of seeing realistic discussion on the market.  But nope, all I see is memes about how well it's doing and how we're going to ride it into heaven and have all our wildest dreams come true.
Seriously though, any tips on protecting capital value? I've tried hedging a bit with a couple of other cryptos, and ofc I don't have my life's savings in here, just a bit that I'm willing to gamble.

  &gt;  3 - 4 times a day
I check my lazy portfolio 3-4 times a month and even that's probably excessive haha!
Thanks, your explanation makes sense. You recover your investment and then play with the remainder, which is very sensible. You probably won't feel as bad losing anything from that because you've still got back what you'd invested originally!

Any recommendations? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:34:39
Thanks! I'll check it out.

Ah, hadn't realised I could just use my Coinbase account for it!  Although it's making me send in even more ID to verify and I am not comfortable with that.....
Edit: nevermind, it seemed to give up asking after a while....!
Thanks for your help

I have no idea what you just said.
I'm actually pretty new to investing in general.  Only started earlier in the year, and that's with a lazy portfolio.
So, the value goes up by $100. You draw down $25. You keep doing this every now and then until you have recovered whatever you paid for it.  And then you reinvest it? And you lost me there lol.
Thanks though :) I'm gonna look into how to deal with active portfolios since my research to date has been on lazy ones, which imo are easier to start with.

I'd disagree to an extent.  The people putting money in right now, to ride the wave, are gambling much like you'd do at Vegas or in a bookies.
However there are still a lot of people that believe Bitcoin and other cryptos will make for a good hedge against RL currencies.  These are the people investing. It's tough to do that right now since there's so much uncertainty around whether the price of bitcoin is inflating due to speculation or if it will hold any of it down the line.  Basically, not everyone is here looking for a gamble, but the only conversation on this sub seems to be only about gambling.

I worded it all wrong, I meant that was the price they offered me!  
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:15:30
Yeah I know this, I was just surprised that I was buying when the dashboard showed a reasonable dip, but the price offered was higher than the highest dashboard figure for the past 12 hours. It just got me a little outraged and now it's too late to delete this.
What exchange do you use?
