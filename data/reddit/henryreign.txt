This was so far the most ridiculous thing I've read.

We're all gonna be in our governments own blockchains with every transactions and heartbeat tracked. In 10 years, it might be considered illegal TO NOT trade through a blockchain.

I just put mine ;) if you live in Finland (which I assume), they'll take off 50% off the loan if you graduate in time.

Blockchain in general is great for socialists as when government bans all "off\-chain" transactions, tax dodging and money laundering become practically impossible. Private and public spending and investments will become much more transparent, which is good for the people.

Why do bitcoin\-educators have all the good things going for them \(intellect, charisma\) except for their name? *Saifedean*, are you kidding me? I only try pronouncing this guys name and by the time I've pronounced all my friends have lost their interest. 
For god's sake give me one decent guy who knows bitcoin and his name is Bill George or something!

Coingate is the only gateway now that is easy to integrate, supports  multiple currencies and looks good.

BTCPay is not easy enough yet for everyone to implement. Most people don't know how to setup Let's encrypt (let alone a virtual server) or how to use Azure, and it costly too.
