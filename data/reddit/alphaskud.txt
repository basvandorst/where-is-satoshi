What is it with people and Lamborghini's. They arnt even nice cars.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:26:26
Bitcoin is going down. Ripple is gaining popularity and is cheap to get ibto.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:09:06
It was only skyrocketing because the media kept talking about it.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:54:03
What's hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:25:00
The function for me to make MILLIONS maybe even BILLIONS without needing to do anything.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:01:49
If it was , and you brought at 15k does it just mean you have basically tripled your initial investment?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:13:40
I got in at 23k. Fucks me what what converts to in US. Whatever's. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:45:28
I see it getting quiet over christmas. Nobody will be cashed up. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:00:35
I'm eagerly waiting for my funds to arrive into my BC wallet. 3.5k.  Crazy to think I was only trying last week and it was under 10k , now its 23k here. Ahhhhhhhgh.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:11:07
Personally bitcoin is about as interesting as watching grass grow. I will return in 10 years.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:40:46
I've got 1.5k in bitcoin - not much but that's all i'm prepared to get. It is pretty useless. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:05:27
Tree fiddy
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:31:01
It will drop like a rock if a msm story starts tending about how much it's falling.  They control the rise and falls.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:27:05
Obvisiouly the more you have invested the more you check unless money is nothing. I deposited 3.5k the otherday to get started but might just use 1k and not use the rest and just wait.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:34:49
I think bitcoin has peaked.  I'd cash out and buy ripple.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:57:04
It's alot of bs'ing about to buy coin here. You need send all this ID rubbish and then more after that. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:08:15
I tried setting up years ago to buy weed through the tor browser but had no idea what to do either.  It was like 40 bitcoin for a 1/4 weed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:28:11
All that needs  to happen is a storey to start trending on facebook feeds about how great  it is and it will go back up again. That was what started the skyrocketing prices the last few weeks --- breaking 8k then 9k---- then will it goto 10k ect.
Start worrying when it's trending about the bubble bursting.  Im glad I havent invested yet.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:49:28
Stocks haven't soared though?
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:47:42
So it will crash to 40k.  Meh.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:26:50
Hold the door!
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:27:05
I sold my BTC and brought all Ripple
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:46:39
It's basically the same as yesterday. I reakon it's peaked.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:19:28
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:55:27
I'm not particularly interested in watching the market - i do think ripple is better then bitcoin but it's a pain in the ass to buy .  I'll probably end up hodling for years just because I cbf working out how to withdraw.
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:47:59
Crypto is a joke
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:11:50
This scenario pisses me off because that could have been me. Back a few years ago I went to try get bitcoins to buy weed through the dark web. It cost like 12 bitcoin for 1/4 or somthing like that.    
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:37:40
Im going to buy when it hits 2k
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:49:40
Buy ripple shares i sold off all my bitcoin and brought ripple and gained %20 --- $400 increase overnight.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:16:40
What will happen - msm / facebook will fuel the crash by saying bitcoin has peaked.  It will drop like crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:53:45
Meaning bitcoins will be free .
Then it will skyrocket to 23k and we all retire billionaires. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:30:42

@_date: 2018-09-09 04:19:42
But if nobody is using it it's worthless
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:27:55
Easier to use paypal. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:57:06
Yeah but you live in China.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:12:35
I doubt you'll see much increase for the opposite reason. It's christmas and people are busy. Probably also skint.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:59:19
Wouldn't there be an app that could do that already for you? Just set a price that you want to buy at and let it go.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:11:36
It is really.
What can you buy in bitcoin apart from blackmarket things.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:36:41
0.06 . Sold that off and brought 750 units of ripple.  Doubled my money over night.
@_date: 2018-09-08 11:54:30
No. Don't do this.
Live life.
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:26:09
Also it's Chinese New Year
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:55:35
Works fine here
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:52:48
Anytime , because whats powering bitcoin is the expectation that this time next year it will be worth 10x what is is now.
@_date: 2018-09-09 04:21:46
Which is why Bitcoin itself won't survive. Money is power and control for everything.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:53:51
I would buy ripple shares instead. They have gone up 50c the last few days.  They were at 30c now they are at 80.

Yeah well , Satoshi can go eat a bag of dick
@_date: 2018-08-21 09:41:23
Is there another sub? It just surprises me how dead this place is.
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:27:03
In BTC there is . Other cryptos don't seem to drop as much if at all , that might signal decoupleing from da coin.
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:55:39
It will. It will shoot back up predictibly once the trading bots kick in.
@_date: 2018-08-05 23:54:47
Pew Pew pew!!
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:50:04
Yes but the big player is China with massive Bitcoin mines and very unregulated.  
@_date: 2018-08-28 10:06:47
Why is it going up though?
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:48:06
Who tf are these lazy idiots making decisions? Just do it already .
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:18:07
Anything "could"
@_date: 2018-08-12 03:59:48
Bitcoin is already way to high for people to make  significant money in. You need to buy at virtually nothing and go from there.
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:23:03
Bitcoin will pave the way for crypto 2.0
Bitcoin is like Napster , where the new market will be like Spotify
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:44:06
 Mods can be dicks like that. Probably some kid tripping on the power to ban 
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:03:08
But maybe the big wigs know the result and are offloading while they can?
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:44:56
It must be the whales in "Big Crypto"  paying the people who make decisions to hold off while they stock up in the crashing market.

@_date: 2018-08-01 23:53:52
How do you work out the average?
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:43:08
How can something so pissy use so much power. Bad design if you already me.
@_date: 2018-05-20 10:31:21
What's with all the foil? Like a real life radar jammer?
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:48:31
No point investing in something with a price so high already. Better to invest in other cryptos that cost cents but have real world uses. Bitcoin is just a FU use to Govts and regulations .  
@_date: 2018-05-17 10:08:17
You are losing money 
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:36:24
My car is like 15 years old and bumpy as all fuck to drive.
Still , I owe nothing on it.
@_date: 2018-08-07 07:54:04
China. Where regulations are none.  
@_date: 2018-08-28 10:08:33
Yeah it will , it'll be 0 when nobody uses it
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:45:04

Christmas presents for people in crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:29:09
Nah. By 2019 nobody will be using BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:32:24
50 cent. 
$1 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:27:58
Bitcoin.. a coin founded as an FU to the banks and championed by anarchists dives when its ETF request gets rejected... the sheer irony hahaha.
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:22:44
Sec can go eat a bag of dicks
@_date: 2018-05-17 10:09:41
How were you using 17kwh last year each day?  I use less then 1.
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:39:14
Crypto needs regulations. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:48:15
It's already been that way for ages.
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:33:14
Mining is such a waste of time lol.  It costs 20k in power to mine a coin here  and 88,000,kWh for everyone.
That's almost of money.  It costs basically twice as much in power cost to mine a coin.
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:34:26
! remind me 1 year
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:46:04
Why does it even matter. Bitcoin is supposed to be a FU to everyone else. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:01:04
 They are onto us! Quick Crash the market so we cans buy MORE!!
@_date: 2018-05-28 02:46:56
Wang Chung  finnaly got that Lambo.
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:23:51
I think we'll keep fluctuating until real adoption happens which won't be BTC. Then it's curtains.
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:01:52
It's the same story for all the cryptos.  I think it's just early investors bailing out as it gets close to their buy in prices.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:13:32
Just a temp respite
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:02:57
BTC won't go up enough to be worth long term gains unless it crashes to rock bottom again .
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:43:33
Coinbase asks you to send pictures of ID's online.
Among alot of other personal info.
@_date: 2018-06-19 02:31:18
I use PayPal all the time. It's good. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:04:54
Mining became unprofitable about 6months ago here.
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:40:34
Off course it is as is the decline so it can happen again.  Buy in August people.
@_date: 2018-06-17 23:54:36
Whales wouldn't want it to moon. Just as much money buying and selling each week.
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:31:44
It's a way to waste money on electrical bills for a small reward that won't cover the cost to run in the first place.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:42:11
It is funny. I brought other crypto way easier and faster then Bitcoin. The amount of personal info they ask you to send over is alarming.
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:51:57
3 people 
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:55:48
Which is why btc won't succeed.  It's unregulated. In a world where EVERYTHING is regulated what makes you think govts will just ignore it and let people do their own thing.
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:32:32
I got out at 19k
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:50:27
I use it all the time for eBay stuff and the funds go on instantly with transfer to my bank account in a day or so.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:37:58
$10 it is then!
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:45:34
Why would a Bitcoin ever cost that much?
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:02:01
If you can work out how tf you do that. Tried many years ago to buy weed but gave up.
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:11:58
Next stop. Moon.
@_date: 2018-06-17 00:02:17
88,000kwh is what it costs to mine a coin apparently.  Google says so. So here it would cost roughly $18.5k to get a coin. BTC is around $8.5k right now so I'm out of pocket $10k.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:14:59
BTC sure gets hacked alot for something apparently so secure.
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:43:43
Just buy a bit each week. If for a couple of weeks it's higher then I'd say it's bottomed.
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:51:15
I'd rather BTC crash to be worth nothing and then buy back in then what it is now. I'd welcome a dump.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:40:22
Crypto is rigged in general. You wait give it a day or so and prices will be back where they were yesterday or today before the crash.  It's manipulated by rich people.
To make money you gotta invest in something that is actually good and hold it for years.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:11:12
Don't expect it to climb any time soon , it will go back up to ATH along with the other cryptos when the whales manipulating the market have hit the bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:04:43
It hasn't been profitable here for the last 6 months power costs 21c per kwh but people still do it. They haven't done the math and are probably the same people bitching about the cost of living .
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:19:14
The bottom will be around where it was pre media hype so around $5000 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:44:11
Which is why bitcoin won't stick around.   No regulation in a regulated world. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:19:07
No. Bitcoin was compared to Napster where others are like Spotify.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:32:19
But in 4 years time bitcoin will be obsolete
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:12:41
If you have 10 apples , you need 10 more to break even , to get your investment back. I know.
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:55:40
Sweet so it costs 22k to mine a 10k coin.
Making the big bucks boysssssss!!
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:09:02
Massive signs of adoption.....market crashing.....
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:54:16
Down 2k since yesterday....
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:18:07
800 would be awesome. It would mean all the other better coins are dirt cheap.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:50:33
Hodlers at this stage are like the band going down with Titanic.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:18:17
Buy the dip? Every second in the day is the dip.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:42:37
Cool bro
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:08:30
Real lightning
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:31:51
It seems so amateurish doing this 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:42:27
Why should btc even be at 10k when a conpany like Apple is $50?
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:58:36
Waiting  for fcking money to get deposited. Did it over the weekend ,  3 business days later still nothing.
Stop keeping my money and transfer it . Cunts.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:12:56
10,000? More like 10 MILLIONS!
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:26:16
It does. So you need btc to goto over 20k to even start being profitable.   It's too much.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:23:38
You could just transfer CC money to a debit account.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:06:52
Hehehe...it's funny because I used my CC to buy crypto too.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:08:09
I'd sell if you are still going to profit. Buy back cheaper and get teh coinz
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:20:39
I'm looking to buy other crypto but as Bitcoin seems to control the prices there is no point as tomorrow will be lower again.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:45:35
Buy the dip at 2k
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:10:54
Banning CC shouldn't do much. What's stopping people from just transferring money from the CC into a savings account and using it that way to buy.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:38:07
Expert..... that's slang for a 15 year old keyboard warrior right?
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:44:51
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:48:31
Coz it's only going to go cheaper
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:17:20
You are in the dip right now. Every crypto is.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:25:44
Assuming the price will go alot higher then what tou brought at
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:26:51
It's pretty scammish if you ask me. It seems to be run by bots trading each other lowering and pumping prices all the time. It makes no sense.  
@_date: 2018-07-18 07:46:56
Coinbase are dickheads and don't want competition . They don't want to add certain coins and will have no choice if this ruling sticks and look biased.
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:55:09
There is no value in btc. If you buy at 10k it needs to goto 20k to break even. It's all too high.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:43:42
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:12:15
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:45:07
How much money do you make a week mining ?
@_date: 2018-07-29 03:26:23
You pay 10c per kwh? Bargain. Here it is 25c.
@_date: 2018-07-02 07:47:31
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:08:02
For half a day...
@_date: 2018-07-18 05:46:07
How do you get trading bots?
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:41:21
That Xmas time bonus ;)

Bitcoin is like a crab and only goes sideways
@_date: 2018-07-08 23:00:42
Ponzi scheme - they left that one out.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:27:47
I just read what people say on reddit and take it as gospel.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:18:02
Weird. People would actually need to do stuff instead of being a zombie looking at a screen.
@_date: 2018-07-16 22:03:51
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:14:41
Or use said coding skills and sell them to others?
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:26:44
Second wave rally ....dumps %5 overnight...
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:35:27
Well I sold after a week assuming I brought at the ATH of 20k.  Glad I did.
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:44:07
Bitcoin has been in the top 10 of WORST performing cyrptos the last few days. It's doing nothing while everything is moving up on it's own.
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:41:11
Pretty high. If a coin is unregulated it's not going be popular with regulators - the governments - security ect ect and it will just be dropped world wide.
If it is regulated the price will drop because non regulations got it so high in the first place.
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:32:29
The prices right now have been the lows for the last week or so.  I'm guessing it will shoot up in a few hrs dragging all the others with it. Btc needs to crash so everything else can run independently.
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:54:58
I tried buying weed years ago on the dark web with bitcoin and couldn't work it out so gave up and just brought shitty street weed
