Your wife is smarter than you.  
The price did crash. Huobi dropped 40% in a couple of days and the US exchange were down close to that much.
But live in whatever fantasyland you have to in order to sleep at night.

That wasn't why it failed.  It will probably fail again if anyone tries it.

You are proud of "Bitcoin" or the "PBOC"?  Because Bitcoin didn't have shit to do with it.  PBOC did.

Top 5 in what respect?   In your top 5 favorite banks?

Non sequitur.
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:03:49


Because lots of people are stupid.

It was already tried a couple of years ago and pretty much failed, across the industry.

They will never give up although the battle has been lost long ago.

Yes it sucks and is very demoralizing, but I would say don't give up, even though the temptation is there to do so.  But I can see how that would leave a bad taste in your mouth.  I've lost thousands of dollars from hacks at Gox and Bitfinex and also had another website's poor design cost me another few thousand $.  But I am still way up overall with Bitcoin.  That says a lot.

Back to where the price was a few weeks ago. Congratulations.
@_date: 2016-11-02 12:44:58
That was already tried and it basically failed.

You sound so sure of that.
So I'll be sure that no they wouldn't.  With someone brand new to Paxful vs someone with 1500+ feedback, who do you think they are going to side with and believe.   Not to mention that 95% of new people who trade Amazon on their first trade are scammers.  This guy probably isn't but they don't know that.
@_date: 2016-12-26 08:50:20
If someone has a high feedback score, then he isn't a "random" dude.  But yeah, use Coinbase and have the IRS looking into your business and also Coinbase fucked over 100x more customers than Localbitcoins users every did.  I've bought on LBC and Paxful a lot, and a few problems, but nowhere like "Conbase".
In some other countries, you can just go to the store and buy a card that you can redeem for BTC.  But not in the USA and many other places because the bankers and gov'ts do not want the competition.

Yes it is hard to obtain them and that is no accident.  The reason it's hard to get them is that the government has it regulated, so that is the case.  
That sucks though and at least you reported him and obviously if he did that to everyone, he would not be on Paxful much longer.
You should also contact Amazon and tell them that your code was stolen and if that happens to him too much, then his Amazon acct would be closed as well.

LOLOLOL ...without all the manipulation and fuckery in this market.  It's not legitimate any more than $1150 was.

It will probably be easier for the gov't to confiscate your gold than it will be to get to your Bitcoin.  Although can just bury the gold somewhere in accessible.

Has anyone figured out how to do this in the USA with a prepaid gift card?   A friend of mine got a couple of them for Christmas and wants to to buy Bitcoin with them.  I assume would have to use VPN and say you aren't in the USA, but then not sure if there's a way to use USA prepaid gift card.
It's probably not doable, but just asking for him.  He lives in a state where it's totally legal.  He did a lot of research and checked.

They lied and said that only 0.5% of customers BTC was exposed to even possible hack or security concerns.  This has been posted many times..the link to where they said that on Bitfinex.com.
