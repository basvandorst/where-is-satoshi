Incorporate in Switzerland. Contribute fiat to it. Register on an exchange in Europe as an institutional investor. Fund your trading out of your corp. Keep as much of your USD as possible outside of USA. All manner of tax benefits accrue to you.

I only see the free version of cointracking.info on goog Play. I'm not seeing a paid version.  Am I looking for the wrong thing? THanks.

This is interesting.  Let me simplify with an analogy. If I delivered USD 1 million to your door tomorrow, no one, except you and I would know. But you do have an option whether to tell a friend or put it in the bank in which case you'll be discovered. But if we both keep our mouths shut (effectively an encryption) no one, no AI will ever know. Agree?

Isn't this no different than the pseudonymity of BTC? Are you saying ZEC is not completely anonymous, just more difficult to identify the parties than it is with BTC?

These people (dimon, buffet, winkloss, etc) are used to moving markets just buy opening their mouths. And in so doing they can easily create pricing differentials, and using their cash hoards (hedge funds, whatever) swoop in and do the pump and dump. why? because they can.  that's what happened when BTC hi 19.8 and also when it declined to the 11-14 range we're in now. When BTC hits 4 thou they will buy out the store, and then there's nothing left. IMHO.

No. If you take something that you shouldn't, something that doesn't belong to you, that's stealing. Privacy document or no, I have a choice and I walk with my feet.

I suspect there will be a line and a check box on the new tax forms that will ask whether you have an account outside the US.

My concern about Gemini is it is owned by some very wealthy people. And there are no rules in crypto (it being unregulated) that say an exchange owner can't self-deal or manipulate the market to their advantage over their customers.  I believe this to be the case. Am I misinformed? Perhaps this scenario also played a roll in the run-up of BTC to USD 20K last month. Who is to say the owners (and their associates) of Coinbase, Gemini or other exchanges weren't trading freely while everyone else was jammed in traffic congestion on the blockchains. This is unregulated. You can report your money to the treasury, but that doesn't mean you can't scam the rest of the world. I'm not saying crypto is useless, or it's going to die. But it is the wild wild west. Just sayin'

What if you trade in hong kong and keep your "winnings" in the exchange. You never bring the dough back to US. eh? Do not repatriate.

I'm not sure if what you say is good or bad because my knowledge is this area is limited. My understanding of ZEC is there is a cryptography that hides the identifying information of a transaction but allows a verifier to be satisfied that a transaction is true. Or something.

Look at the fundamentals - will the coin be useful, who is behind it, are they adequately capitalized, how far along are they in their development, do they communicate regularly and openly, are they meeting their self imposed deadlines, can you stomach the risk, how much can you afford to loose, how many coins in circulation, how is the market cap, can you wade through the rough patches (in other words, invest long-term). IF your looking to trade on movement (timing) that's a lot harder. And there is no regulation so there is nothing to say your order will go in before someone else's who will be treated more favorably. Will the crypto-echange be hacked? Will it go out of business? These are all questions to ask. Do the homework. We all think we are cool, but there's institutional investors (sharks, whales and whatnot) with huge piles of fiat who can easily manipulate the market and suck all the oxygen out. If you bought BTC at 19.8 you have big balls and you learned the hard way. I hope BTC hits 40k sometime soon but I wouldn't bet my life on it that's for sure.

I like the side effects of the BTC frenzy. People came to the world of token. And the price of BCH, which we got for free courtesy of the hard fork, went mad crazy.

look at the entity that is minting the coins to see what they plan to do with their money. if you think they have a good business model, you like what you see, and you can afford (and have the stomach) to risk some of your hard earned dollars, then go for it. if you're in it for the "me too" effect (not to be confused with  then you are definitely gambling. despite what you read on reddit, no one knows whether a coin is going to go up, down or sideways. it's a fugazi. i digress. if on the day after their ico the company posts a picture of their brand new really nice office with incredibly beautiful custom paint job, expensive furniture, a foos table, a pool table and an indoor basketball hoop, and all they have is vaporware, you might want to ask where their heart is. A fool and his/her money are easily parted.

BTC denominations go all the way down to 100,000,000th of BTC. It's called one Satoshi. 1 Satoshi=0.00000001 ฿. Become a millionaire in Satoshi and have fun!

Try ZEC. It's anonymous. It's on Kraken.

Thanks for the fast replies. Much obliged.

One option is to contact a person, say on reddit, who wants to trade crypto with you. You agree on a price, exchange wallet addresses and you don't have to deal with these f'd up exchanges.  There's a trust factor. So start off with a small amount. This way you by-pass the exchange, your exchanges should happen much faster. Also, there is no law that says you couldn't pay someone USD for crypto. It's all a matter of trust, because if you don't know your trading partner you could get bilked. Let's face it, the exchanges may not be much safer. IMHO.

Coinbase still has Bitcoin cash from the hard fork in August all locked up.  The price went from zero to over USD 1,700 since. No one can access it. They promise to have it in our account/wallet by Jan. 1, 2018.  Bitcoin gold - no announcement at all. Will we ever get it?

Here we go. Get ready for the next pump. Now is the time to buy. Buy at few sats at 10K and watch it go back to 20.  HODL. (disclaimer: unregulated investments are risky and there is no guarantee that you won't lose some or all of your money) With a little luck you too can dance the Lambo.
