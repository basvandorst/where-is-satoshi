Two Cheetos  and one cup

 �� �� ����I felt that ☝️ 
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:19:28
Try again later. Maybe a connection error of some sort. That happened to me before. Nothing to worry about unless you need the funds right away. I don’t think there’s an outage of some sort. So you should be fine. Try again in an hour or two. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:41:02
Go ahead and penetrate that market
@_date: 2018-10-17 17:52:25
Hope so. Tired of eating ramen noodles �� 
@_date: 2018-06-07 03:43:25
I almost shouted when I read this ��
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:36:04
Good one but no bro. I’m a man lol
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:37:14
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:45:28
True but usually when someone ask about money / dollar. They say do you have 3 dollar(s)/ sat(s). Idk that’s just me though
@_date: 2019-08-28 03:01:51
Right lol
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:46:26
See I look at it as Bitcoin means one or many
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:37:54
My mom what’s to do it but I don’t know
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:35:27
I suppose but sometimes it gets to me. Like I usually say 21 Bitcoin then “X” amount of Satoshi’s
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:30:27
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:27:37
That may have been the case but saying “I have bitcoins” to me just doesn’t sound right
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:18:43
Makes me cringe.
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:48:20
Lol I would’ve just said sat(s)
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:36:55
Lol that’s funny.  I hate when there’s an “S” at the end. Usually when a YouTuber says that. I immediately go to another channel. I know that’s horrible but I can’t stand it
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:58:58
Right. I’m with you on that
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:32:05
See I feel like people shouldn’t say it either but I don’t know though
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:46:30
Right sat(s)
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:57:10
lol no worries
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:01:34
Right. Every time I hear Bitcoins it makes me cringe. It’s like hearing someone slowly dig their nails in to a freshly cleaned chalk board.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:05:55
lol hahahaha honestly enough. I said something similar lol
She always says. Just tell me when I can quit my job lol
@_date: 2019-08-06 16:59:02
See my mom wants to invest in it but I don’t feel like keeping up with the seeds. It’s difficult enough keeping up with all mines lol
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:45:25
Lol you made me spit out my drink with this one lol. Right. I can’t stand it lol ��
@_date: 2019-10-15 22:28:54
lol I mean it was funny but it was no Joker I’ll tell you that lol.
I never go by the reviews honestly. But was shocked when they mentioned Bitcoin and mining
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:46:39
I  agree with you
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:41:14
Lol right. That does make sense though
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:42:32
That’s true also but I will say I bought my nano x with BCH though
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:32:44
lol hahahaha right!!!!!! 
How much waters do you want
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:26:20
Yeah but it makes me cringe asking how much monies you got
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:21:15
Lol fussing just a friendly discussion my friend on which one they prefer if not both
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:33:24
lol mind blown lol
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:59:34
@_date: 2019-08-28 03:01:10
Yeah. How much waters you got in your cup lol  ��
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:00:15
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:58:35
lol. I’m saying though. Just one of my rants because I hear some people on YouTube and in person and it just grinds my gears a little lol but then I laugh it off
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:59:54
I’m the same way. Like I hear it Bitcoin(s) a lot and it makes me cringe
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:29:39
Me too. I just can’t fathom to say Bitcoin(s). The cringe is real.
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:36:57
Hilarious my wife talks like that too ��������
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:40:53
Lol right. How much water do you want? A bottle water or a cup of water vs. how much water(s) do you want or favs lol
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:52:31
Thank you
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:52:19
lol hahahaha so true
@_date: 2019-08-06 19:31:58
lol right. I had on a bitcoin shirt at the movies one day and the sweetest older lady came up to me and said if I knew anything about Bitcoin. She told me her Nephew worked at an exchange but before I could ask which one she hurried up and changed the focus from her nephew to asking more question.  It got to the point to where I said. “Well it’s nice talking to you. I have to get to these previews” lol
@_date: 2019-06-15 00:54:41
Thanks for posting this here. I really forgot to post this here
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:13:53
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:07:57
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:30:37
What???I never said it was me. That’s why I said thoughts on this.
I just updated the post. This isn’t me
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:14:43
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:52:37
lol I do
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:08:25
But here’s the thing. I agree with you about the criminal background, but when I researched Paul the one that’s currently in US custody. It shows that he knew C++ the same as Satoshi. I’m just saying. This is the one article/timeline that stood out to me.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:45:34
Yeah to but and immediately move my stuff. Can’t use Binance anymore soooooooooo lol
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:48:10
Sorry so at one point he was studying for classes for school then he turned around and committed crimes(Ted Bundy) 
As far as the 10 hour shifts I’m just playing devils advocate. But it could be possible. If you read further down(and I’m not saying you didn’t read it) but it goes on to say that around 2012 is when he started to make the shift from being a programmer to running an empire but prior years before he was talking about cryptography naming it virtual coin. I mean it makes since to me but I’m not saying he is, but WHAT IF. You know. I heard and seen people have double life’s before and it’s tots possible
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:22:19
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:13:39
Oh that’s just old voicemails. That I hadn’t listened to yet
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:59:50
Lol I can dig it. Honestly I think of Bitcoin as talking about the entire Network and asset. I think of Satoshis as dollars spent. 
Lol but I do think it’s funny how I hear some youtubers saying “Bitcoin(s) lol
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:57:47
Oh ok. Thank you. I’ll play around with it until I feel comfortable. I’m not going to put anything major on it until I fully understand it. Thank you
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:21:38
Well that escalated quickly
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:00:21
I’ll have to do more research I guess. I don’t like the whole “they control” thing pretty much
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:17:02
I’ll do more research in to it. Just when I saw this article and read it. I was like hmmmmm. Interesting lol. Coo thank you my friend
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:04:03
I don’t my friend. I promise
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:46:08
lol trust me. You ain’t missing nothing
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:27:41
Doooo iiiitttt
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:25:25
Really. Hmmm that’s interesting. IDK though
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:07:52
Yeah I woke up one day and 5GE was here. I can’t tell the difference. AT&amp;T still sucks
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:26:02
Lol hahaha. It’s just some people and stuff. Nothing major lol
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:30:03
Lol. That’s true
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:39:04
That’s sounds about right. I’ll go with your answer lol
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:49:33
Right I have too, but as I read further in to it started to make sense. I’m not saying I believe it all the way but I am saying it’s about 65%. No FuD by the way just wanted to start a discussion.
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:19:01
Probably so. I was searching and didn’t find anything
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:58:06
Lol hahahaha I know right. Me too
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:52:15
Believe it or not. I think this is true. I vary rarely believe anything that I read, but for some reason this article stood out to me. It makes sense on why the wallet hasn’t moved in years.
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:40:10
Yeah. I personally feel that Bitcoin shouldn’t be under 10k at this moment but that’s just me
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:41:01
Me too. I’m long term also, but one of these days. Some if not most traders are going to go short one too many times and get left behind when Bitcoin just explodes
@_date: 2019-12-28 15:42:10
Tried Coinbase and didn’t work
@_date: 2019-12-10 03:08:13
1 Bitcoin is worth 1 Bitcoin. The moment you sell is the  moment you lose
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:01:22
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:12:24
Just trying to have a friendly discussion friend. Calling me Pathetic and not giving your opinion on what you think about it in my case is Pathetic my friend. Sorry not sorry
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:17:57
Yo. I’ve been trying to find this. This is hilarious
@_date: 2019-12-28 18:56:47
Yes. I’m fine with that. The route I was doing would’ve made me wait several days to get it off the exchange quickly
@_date: 2019-12-28 18:57:22
Thank you. I forgot about them. I’ll try that next time.
@_date: 2019-12-28 18:34:31
It didn’t work. What I ended up doing was had someone put the gift card on their PayPal.  Then I ad them send it my PayPal account(where I have a PayPal business debit card). After that I then went to trust wallet and used it there. It went through 
Thank you so much again
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:21:51
Now that part I didn’t think about, but it does make sense about Silk Road and what not. IDK though. I just feel this story makes sense. The reason why he hasn’t said anything or came fourth. I mean someone could go and interview him at least to see. That is at least under my assumption that he can have visitation even if that’s possible. I guess just out of all the stories I’ve seen and read. This one makes the most sense to me
@_date: 2019-12-28 18:31:28
True and true. Wanted to buy more crypto before Jan 1st
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:51:02
No it’s just a regular gift card. I registered my name under it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:30:47
Lol hahahaha. I know right.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:58:31
Fingers Crossed. Hopes too
@_date: 2019-12-28 15:41:43
Ok. I’m going to try that 
Thank you
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:32:27
True, but that’s just like saying Ted Bundy didn’t kill all those women either. So it’s very much so possible. I just want to know everyone’s input on this.
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:57:11
Huh let me take a look. 
“No way, it’s OVER 9 THOUSAND” 
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:22:58
She after you lucky Coins mate 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:28:46
This is my guess 4600. If that breaks maybe 42 then if that breaks could be 3. 
Tone believes 5k by end of the year 
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:00:20
Post of the year right there. I needed that giggle mate 
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:23:51
Naw but good stuff I like that shirt 
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:03:45
Create a 100 page book with your everyday life and include a seed randomly but in order. And write down the page numbers or you could either bold or italicize the words. where only you know. I did this. The average person wouldn’t know that and 50 years from now neither will they. 
Ive done this. 
Make sure to tell only ones you trust the name of it. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:09:08
That Ludacris song came to my head. 
Thanks. I needed that smile. 
Morning 
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:59:40
I haven’t tried this yet but it may work. But I would be gift cards(min) first create a name for your visa debt gift card and try to upload it on coinbase and see if that lets you do it. Now I haven’t tried it yet but I’ve thought about it but it may work by just registering your name 
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:34:33
Hey you can send crypto via SMS.  I only say it like this because currently it’s only for BCH and I assume it’ll more than likely roll out to others as well. I have BTC as well by the way. So it’s possible. I believe it’s currently in the beta phase to be honest. 
Still exciting if it’s coming to BTC also. It’ll be a win for both. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:17:32
To be honest I have no idea. I just read that cointext was in the works of releasing this to public at the end of March. I would assume it would hit BTC sooner than later but I’m not sure. 
I just like the tech idea behind it. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:22:26
Lol ��
@_date: 2019-05-06 16:29:25
Ok thank you for the info.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:57:58
lol hahahaha you got me on that one.
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:20:29
I’m not sure but it’s some sort of new paint. This isn’t the first I’ve see this but it’s the first I seen it for a Lamborghini
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:09:37
Dang this hurts my soul. Sorry this happened to you(Divorce) it’ll workout for you eventually. But 24 BTC wow holy mackerel.
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:59:21
Naw. Accumulate all the stones which makes everyone want them even more.
