becouse cryptocurrencies wasn`t profitable in general in the beginning. My guess is, the more BTC becomes worth, the more cryptocurrencies you will see pop up. There will be 10000+ of them.

tell him about digi-cash, e-money, hashcash, &amp; egold. Those were the napsters and myspaces of this space. BTC is the real thing.

He is the same with gold, always doubling down. In a way he is the same as the current system, in the sense he is its mirror image.
@_date: 2014-03-14 06:22:50
Damn. things move just amazingly fast in this space. And judging by the attitudes in the panel you`d say Bitcoin is gonna happen. whether you like it or not.

This is good. Everyone that is firmly against the idea of Bitcoin, should NOT own any themselves. otherwise its just con artistry.
@_date: 2014-05-25 23:33:23
first time 2011. The dutch gouvernment whas clamping down on downloading more, so i started to look into TOR and darkweb and found silkroad. there whas BITCOIN, i didnt bother :( Then later that year wikileaks started accepting it and still i didnt see the deeper value of BTC :( Finaly got in at  40$ when cypress (2013) happened.
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:40:07

Tell them that Bitcoin is awesome and will probably be a pilar of light. But tell them also that cryptocurrencies and blockchain is bigger then Bitcoin alone. Tell them that we are on the cusp of yet another tech revolution and that this will change the fabric of the world just as much as the internet did.
@_date: 2015-10-31 00:44:40
dun dun dun ... haters can now kill us with bitcoin.

the goldbug is soo wrong. I will not be interested in gold because the only gold that compares to BTC is physical gold (not a stacker). The markets "paper" gold i don`t want becouse it is realy just crap.
