If you are an average joe you have internet and an ID. So why can’t an average joe just get on the exchange?

I’m sure they aren’t selling bitcoin at a same price. It is connected to the internet, watching price in real time and do the offering based on current price(CP) + CP * 0.35.

Is it possible to buy other crypto at a decent price? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:38:29
That’s not what I’m saying. The company should make an account and they would resell the coins that are straight up bought from coinbase

Gemini is taking 0.25% on each trades (assuming you won’t go all balls in and trade more then 5000 BTC (~$50,000,000) per months.
Bitstamp has fees for even depositing money to their side. Minimum $7.5! That’s insane. Also withdraw your money will cost you another $15 minimum. And on top of that there is the 0.25% that they take on each of your trades. Complete joke.
I would either recommend binance or gdax (I know I know this is also coinbase in same way)
Binance has pretty low fees compared to the previous two. 0.10% (or less) on each trade, withdrawals can be a bitch sometimes but depositing is free. 
Gdax is good for only four currencies, (BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC), but you can have 0% on the trades and withdrawals are paid by gdax too. Deposit is easy and free too.

There is no such a thing as out of bitcoins. It’s not a physical coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:14:55
I don’t understand why not connect their service to something like coinbase and have pretty much “unlimited” supply of coins

There isn’t such a thing as instant confirmation. If you check your Trezor at the same time you send the money, it should say that you have received the coin but have not been confirmed or have only 1-2 confirmations.

The real issue is that the liquidity is so low that the market can be “easily” manipulated by the big whales.
Larger market liquidity would bring a more stable market.

Thought running a lightning node is free.... setting it up shouldn’t be that difficult. If we want proper adoption we should try to push the prices down to something like $30 from $300.

Your raspberry pi won’t receive any bitcoins. It’s running a full node which means it keeps a full copy of the blockchain synced up with all other nodes
