short squeeze - here we go

You could try something like 4chan or maybe some gaming sites - people on those forums are usually very much open to innovative/technology stuff (mmo champion, d2jsp, ownedcore etc) or even get into business with some more serious news sites who offer to give you some space or a link on their website. 
I think the free online forums would be better to start off and get peoples attention. The professional news services will come from themselves in time.

This is great! First time I am seeing this - you should get this out on other forums too. Hope to see this more often. 
I think everyone here appreciates the effort you put into this. Enjoy your platinum!

Only time will tell. Bitcoin has often done what everyone expected and just as often went out of its way causing people to get burned and fomo back in. I'd buy in at a price im comfortable with holding through the worst expected outcome but at the same time having the chance for better gains if it does the opposite

the recent pumps are just people closing their shorts with market buys. you can check the BTCUSDSHORTS on bitfinex and will see that its almost 100% correlated. nothing to do with manipulation

people closing their shorts. lovely to watch and at the same time sick how much bitcoin it allows people to sell on margin with low equity
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:42:33
Just in case anyone is wondering why the price is doing what its doing:
Those moves are 100% correlating with the amount of shorts being added/closed right now. You can check for yourself and see that when the price pumped in the exact same time frame, about 3k btc short positions were closed aka bought back on bitfinex.
Dont be fooled guys - nobody is selling to the shorters atm and they need to buy back at some point

just in case anyone is wondering whats happening.
the current price is almost 95% correlated with the amount of BTC shorted on bitfinex. you can check for yourself - anytime somebody shorts, the price goes down and if some whale closes his position we see those huge spikes. check the charts for yourself. and by the way - today we've reached the highest amount of BTC shorted since over half a year. If all those were to close their positions we would probably rally to over 10k again very easy. 
There's two possibilities here imo: people buy back in and liquidate the shorters REALLY bad (as happening in september last year when we bounced from 3k -&gt; the following 5k-7k movements were almost all shorts who bought back in at a loss - check the charts) or the shorters manage to scare more people into selling into their shorts so they can buy back at a profit and then rebuy for good. yet the low volume selling indicates there are simply not enough people to panic sell anymore which may catch the bears off guard.
thats just what im seeing tho. im super interested in how this turns out - the amount of short positions open we are seeing now is very new land and exciting to watch

Also price movements are almost 100% correlated with longs/short increasing on finex. that dump earlier today from 6.8k today to 6.6k is identical to the amounts of shorts increased on bitfinex in that exact time period.
dont get fooled people - nobody is selling anymore - only people shorting who at some point have to buy back in their positions

Don't see the issue here? I'll give you three examples for better understanding:
1) Buy BTC for 100€ -&gt; Sell WITHIN 12 months for 500€. -&gt; 400€ Gain - but as they are within the price range Absatz (3) they are tax free.
2) Buy BTC for 100€ -&gt; Sell WITHIN 12 months for 10.000€. -&gt; 9.900 Gain. -&gt; but NOT exempt from tax since you sold within a year
3) BTC for 100€ -&gt; Sell AFTER 12 months for 10.000€. -&gt; 9.900 Gain. -&gt; but exempt from tax since you sold after a year
Hope that helps

if you hold bitcoins for over a year in austria any gains or losses are exempt from tax.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:06:57
sorry i dont think there is a list available somewhere summarizing different jurisdictions. but two examples i know of : Austria and Germany. maybe people from other EU countries can chime in as well if they know more

Einkommensteuergesetz: 
§ 31. (1) Spekulationsgeschäfte sind Veräußerungsgeschäfte von Wirtschaftsgütern des Privatvermögens, wenn die Einkünfte nicht gemäß § 27 oder § 30 steuerlich zu erfassen sind und der Zeitraum zwischen Anschaffung und Veräußerung nicht mehr als ein Jahr beträgt. Bei unentgeltlich erworbenen Wirtschaftsgütern ist auf den Anschaffungszeitpunkt des Rechtsvorgängers abzustellen. Bei Tauschvorgängen ist § 6 Z 14 sinngemäß anzuwenden.
(2) Als Einkünfte sind der Unterschiedsbetrag zwischen dem Veräußerungserlös einerseits und den Anschaffungskosten und den Werbungskosten andererseits anzusetzen.
(3) Die Einkünfte aus Spekulationsgeschäften bleiben steuerfrei, wenn sie insgesamt im Kalenderjahr 440 Euro nicht übersteigen.
(4) Führen Spekulationsgeschäfte in einem Kalenderjahr insgesamt zu einem Verlust, ist dieser nicht ausgleichsfähig (§ 2 Abs. 2).

many european. Austria for example. basicallly any country that has its own tax rate for speculative investments :)
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:32:37
sorrry not sure what you mean with that. :(
however capital gains never apply since then § 31 wouldnt be applicable in the first place -&gt; first sentence of § 31 (§ 27 are capital gains)
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:22:04
