This will go down in history(blockchain) as the worst government deal of all time when the value of Bitcoin goes to $1MM. And I can't wait! :)

I love this part:
CNBC guy - "you've got the NEA, I'm assuming that's the national education association".
Barry Silbert - "actually the NEA is the largest venture capital firm in the US". (actually NEA is the largest in the world)

I'm not too worried about the 51% attack, but it's really annoying when people freak out over it and there is already a simple solution.

If the Bitcoin community was able to gather enought money to put this commercial in the Super Bowl this year or next, it would be one of the greatest collaborative advertising projects ever, and it would certainly increase the overall value of Bitcoin.
