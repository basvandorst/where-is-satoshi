@_date: 2014-08-19 17:13:20
For this to be true the buys in the Chinese bitcoin exchanges would also have to be fake. These sites, especially BTC China at the time, were often leading the price action. Not totally unbelievable, but that would mean that more than just fake buys on Gox were involved for this to be true. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:00:21
What does Moneygram take as fees? So for example for a $100 gift card, what would you walk out with?

Thanks for reminding me of this. Great video
@_date: 2014-10-26 16:44:32
This only works if it's easier and cheap to acquire Bitcoin. If it costs the consumer close to 10% in fees and time (including exchange rate risk) to get the Bitcoin in the first place then there is no advantage to them over using a credit card.

I'm sorry you must have your head in the sand or are promoting them. I stopped using them long before they lost ACH, there were problems back then too. When Gox first had trouble they had an opportunity to step in and pick up all those US customers. A bit of advertising, positive word of mouth and they would have been THE best and only US exchange. Instead nothing but silence and continued complaints...

Please be cautious if you chose to use CampBX. There is a reason they have low volume and very few people use them. Pretty horrible track record when it come to customer service, etc.

It was 10 years ago, but the 2 restaurants I used to work at in NY state did the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:32:18
The entire function of Mt Gox is to periodically crash the market. Just look at the last 3 years. There are multiple examples, sadly.
This is why I keep $ at exchanges. If there is one thing I've learned over these years it's only a matter of time until the next Gox f/u that crashes the market.
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:15:14
I would love to be able to build off of this if you're up for sharing the basic setup
@_date: 2014-08-23 20:41:49
Except in the comments. Which is still painful to read. Perhaps though I would have the same reaction to reading most article comments. My first reaction is "look the public still doesn't get it." But then I realized for the type of person that sits around commenting on CNBC articles probably they never will. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 23:08:38

And here's the fundamental issue. It takes an hour or two to move Bitcoin to an exchange and sell. It takes several days to move fiat to an exchange and buy. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:17:31
Thanks for the info. I was wondering what their stance was now on personal accounts.

@_date: 2014-09-08 20:25:24
I think we need to see what Apple announces tomorrow. It's not coincidence the PayPal chose to make this announcement today. 
Now if Apple were to open the door to Bitcoin acceptance in their payments solution...... but honestly that's really unlikely anytime soon.

Unfortunately I have to agree. This is most often the route I take. And i have used bitcoinstore.com a couple of times when they had what I wanted and the price made sense.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:59:33
Yes it makes sense. Many bitcoin holders bought their coins at much lower cost. So your item may be 4 BTC today but to some people who got in at $100 that would only be like spending $400 vs $1800. Just something to consider. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:25:27
Isn't this their old plan? They are supposed to announce a new proposal this week. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:54:01

How about you work on getting your main website up to a usable speed first ? I mean come on its terrible. You have a huge opportunity with all the Gox issues to gain huge amounts of customers and you're blowing it.

Maybe good news that they are actually establishing new banking relationships. However, Japan only doesn't help the rest of us.
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:26:48
you need to get verified, but he cheapest is:
us bank account to Dwolla to Mt. Gox
and the same thing in reverse
$0.25 per transfer. Yes twenty-five cents.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:05:38
And they added Whole Foods today.  Yeah groceries for bitcoin
@_date: 2013-07-02 05:20:51
They are very slow to respond, kinda like their website.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:58:47
FYI I also had coins vanish on the 19th. They are aware of the issue in my case, but warned they are so far back logged it may take several days to resolve. I had a lot more than you suddenly disappear from my account. (No transfer out or sale). Make sure you email support and document your situation
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:31:34
I understand if they are having problems with customer service and are overwhelmed. But to make no public statements at all since [6/7]( and to close the chat box is just making the problem so much worse. Regular updates would go such a long way towards calming people down.
@_date: 2013-08-05 05:12:46
So basically... Still no withdrawals 
@_date: 2013-09-07 01:54:44

Gyft is awesome. I've used for Amazon several times now.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:35:58
The out of coins message on the buy page of their site clearly said you were buying at Friday's rate, whether that be higher or lower.  
@_date: 2013-09-15 14:05:28
This article totally glosses over the real situation. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 05:03:39

While this is a drastic and unfortunate decision for them, the way they have been going on these last few weeks I'm not surprised they were forced to make it. 
Also Coinbase.com just made them completely irrelevant in the market. While it requires verification, they now offer instant Bitcoins from your linked bank account for a 1% fee.
It makes things like the current Bank-&gt;Dwolla-&gt;CampBX seem ridiculous. Or paying BitInstant 3.99% for that matter.
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:11:32
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:43:14
I'll believe that when I see it. At least Coinbase is a real company, not run out of someone's apartment. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:21:04
Also weird activity in my account on the 19th. 10 BTC went missing from my account. There is a sell order in the transaction history ( I didn't sell anything) that when clicked shows details for a purchase back in August. And that weird transaction doesn't show in the buy/sell history list either. Emailed support right away, waiting to hear back
@_date: 2013-08-08 21:56:30
Coinbase is  just killing it right now.Congats

@_date: 2013-08-07 12:37:45
It's because they are not processing cash withdrawals. Once you fund an account on Gox the only way currently to get your money back out is by buying Bitcoins. There are lots of posts on here about the issues over the last couple months. 
If you are in the US CampBx is probably your best bet, Bitstamp for Europe.

Just to chime in - totally legit!
@_date: 2013-07-22 21:55:16
This is a game changer. Finally maybe can switch here from gox
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:34:43
Unfortunately given that they take several days to respond to service emails this charge will likely got through before they can cancel it for you.

I love how these stories fail to mention the large sell off in the wee hours of Sunday the week before. Two huge dumps exactly 1 week apart at the most "off hours" point you can get. This is not reactionary to news. This is well orchestrated. Timing it with the bad news (if that was the case) only helps them manipulate the price that much more.

For US dollars the answer is pretty much no, not for many many months now. This could change in the future... or they could go out of business. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:55:23
35 BTC about a year ago.   Stupid
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:47:26
I had the same thing happen on Tue 6/11. I filed a ticket and it was fixed late the next day. Just fyi.
@_date: 2013-08-08 21:52:37
Localbitcoins is going to be the fastest without established accounts at either Coinbase or CampBX
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:35:31
CampBx clearly does not have the volume for this sort of purchase without massive slippage
@_date: 2013-08-16 03:31:07
If you move to a new phone, make sure you make an encrypted backup in iTunes.  It will back up your google authenticator accounts. A normal backup will not. I'm not sure if that would help with the 7 beta ( and you are restoring from a backup after updating). I damaged my phone and had to get a replacement. I didn't know this and lost all my google auth info.

It will take more than a day for your bank to show the transaction
@_date: 2013-06-08 14:41:30
Careful with CampBx, as a new customer doing a Dwolla transfer for the first time they will not allow you to withdrawal bitcoins for 30 days. But it is likely the cheapest, but not by much. .5% comission to trade.  Coinbase isn't  going to be that much more at 1% fee. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:07:41
This in not surprising
@_date: 2013-09-11 19:52:41
I was the same late yesterday too. No change in price on the buy or sell sides.
@_date: 2013-07-28 22:08:36
I'm not aware of any place you can
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:10:35
It was the last time they had no-fee trading :)
@_date: 2013-09-13 20:19:21
Keep in mind if using CampBX they will not allow you to withdrawal bitcoins for 30 days after your first Dwolla deposit. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:36:43
Same thing happened to me on the same day but for 11 BTC. After walking support through my balance history they agreed it was a software bug on their end and refunded my coins. I exchanged a few messages on reddit with their employee username CorgiDad who was really helpful. Shoot him a PM and perhaps he can help. Mention my case, which was resolved 11 days ago at this point. Good luck

That's crazy. The whole point of the credit card is backup to the ACH main checking account. The reason to block debit cards would be it could be linked to the exact same account. I'm disappointed in them making these changes ( going from 50 instant a day to 10 instant a week only with a Visa card added), but the former was clearly very susceptible to fraud. Growing pains I guess as they develop their model. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:07:31
Perhaps they have a way to get $ out of Gox now and thus are using more of the Gox/Stamp weighted price. It's been over Stamp for several days now. Or they have just decided to increase their margin while keeping the published fee at 1%. If you want to buy Bitcoins in the US there really isn't an easier option and the market will likely support a higher price given the demand and lack of other options.
Anyway kudos to them for the newly designed account history page showing BTC / USD and price per coin. Huge improvement.
@_date: 2013-08-17 15:36:35
Just use the app then
@_date: 2013-07-18 17:58:26
seriously, don't. If only because you will waste more in electricity then earn. Macs are very inefficient for mining, and you will make them completely unusable while mining.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:35:38
Definitely Gyft for now
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:59:32
 has some interesting stuff.

Folks be smart with your money, there is a reason their trading volume is so small. I had high hopes several months ago, but would not recommend anyone send your money there. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:31:16
They wait until the money clears from you bank. This is 3-5 business days. They make an exception for 10 BTC instant a week if you are fully verified with a backup CC they can charge, as other people noted. Unlike an exchange where you send your money in first, they are fronting you the bitcoin, hoping that you have the $ in your checking account when they charge it.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:49:20
Yes and have you ever tried to interact or get support from them? When Gox lost Dwolla, CampBX could have become the largest US exchange. There is a reason their volume remains largely irrelevant in the total market.
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:52:10
Mt Gox is not the place it used to be. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:16:03
Yes, absolutely. However I'd be looking for 100 w replacements mostly. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:26:42
I was going to say  but they don't carry Apple laptops. Probably worth a mention regardless. I've made 3 purchases from them this year with Bitcoin. Each was flawless and shipped quickly. (I'm not affiliated with the site in a any way)
@_date: 2013-06-21 04:16:27
No response from them for me either, just one day i logged in and my account had been switched to verified.
@_date: 2013-07-11 17:14:25
Be very careful with these services. History says it quite often ends badly for the customer. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:41:31
ahhh.. the good old wild west days. Stuff now seems relatively calm in comparison
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:31:15
yep, can't work during the day or sleep at night
