Or remembers the past.
HODL wasn’t the mentality then. Strong/weak hands weren’t even a part of the conversation. It was still viewed as more of a currency than a value store, and overall the community felt that we should actively use it as currency to grow the market and keep it active.

Kevin is a super weird middle name, but that somehow makes him make more sense as a person.

As the old saw goes:
Time in the market beats timing the market.
I agree on recurring buys. Pick an amount of money you won't miss if it's gone, and then set up an automated recurring purchase weekly, or on each pay day. The most important thing is that is a small enough amount that you don't skip the recurring purchases all the time because it's draining your budget. Give it time, and watch wealth build.
I feel like I'll catch some heat here for mentioning this, but for lazy dumb-guy risk management I do the same recurring investment in a Betterment account as I do in BTC, and it's become fun (and stress reducing) to watch how those numbers change in relation to each other.
