The more scholars that indicate it is permissible the more Muslims are likely to consider it so as well. There may always be dissenters but majority support is important. Here is a 2015 article in the Journal of Islamic Banking and Finance explaining why Bitcoin purchase and ownership is permissible and perhaps even favorable compared to fiat

There was an article in the Journal of Islamic Banking and Finance by Charles Evans in 2015 explaining that Bitcoin ownership is permissible in Islam, perhaps even favorable compared to fiat [ Good to see more scholars confirming bitcoin is permissible and even showing enthusiasm. Hopefully countries around the world realize that by even trying to ban bitcoin they would probably simply be left behind as every other nation takes their piece of the pie.

If you're afraid of spending your bitcoin you probably haven't bought enough.

Not really, the question he asked Pompliano was worded in a way that shows he was aware of bitcoin and already had arguments against it but was giving Pompliano a chance to make his case regardless. That's the sense I got when I first saw the clip back then. It's presumptuous to think just because he's a detractor that he doesn't know anything about it. Plenty of people are given the same information and come to the wrong conclusion.
And like you acknowledged, he never said he bought. It's way more clear that Altcoin Daily is lying than if O'Leary was.

Clickbait. He said he "might" buy bitcoin in 2013.

IOTA hit about 24k sats on the ratio a few times in the summer. It is now at about 14k.

It's overwhelmingly considered an altcoin because it failed. If it's price was higher they would call it the real bitcoin. So if the 2x fork fails similarly won't that just be an altcoin after some time as well? Fork for bigger blocks again then?

Another un-thoughtful, bullying comment. Maybe you're the one that doesn't understand one of the two or maybe, like I said, I'm just wasting my time.

Either is fine by me. BIP 148 may cause a chain split but that's certainly not more damaging than ETH taking over the number 1 spot. 2mb hard fork bundle issues are also trivial compared to the ETH flippening. Logistics just have to be worked out.

By quoting a single term you remove it from context. For example, triviality - lowness of importance - is relative. My statement as a whole is specifically worded, provides context, nuance and is non-binary.

Context, sir. If hard fork bundle issues are the most important thing in the universe then it's akin to a god or religion - something to base one's existence or identity over. That's hopefully not the case for you so what you should have replied with initially is why you think hard for issues are more severe than a case where Ethereum is overtaking bitcoin in trading volume, market cap, mining profitability, etc. Again, I only stand by my statement as a whole. If you continue to redirect the narrative I can't assume good intent and I'm probably wasting my time.

Really good points, thank you for sharing. We need to push Segwit forward even if it means an additional block size increase going along with it as well.

Shameless.
