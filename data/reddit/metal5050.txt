I haven't seen anything about BCH that is superior to other alt coins. Ex Litecoin has faster confirmation times and just as low fees. BCH has the marketing power behind it and the confusion around using the bitcoin name.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:18:47
BCH increased block size to 8MB so instead of 7 transactions a second, they can handle 56.  They currently have low fees and transactions are confirmed quickly because there is a lot of space in those blocks.  
One issue is the BCH transaction volume is nowhere near that of bitcoin, so they would still have low fees. However, if they scaled up IE became popular they would run into the same problems bitcoin has today. Their solution is to increase the block size again as needed. This however is a short term solution as if they ever have as many transactions as say visa, then they need blocks for 50,000 transactions a second. Those blocks would be 10000x the size of their 8MB blocks. which simply isn't feasible if you want to remain decentralized. Increasing the block size isn't a long term solution. That's not to say increasing to 2MB isn't a bad idea today, but it just puts a bandaid on a bigger problem.

Technology on the user side (bandwidth limits, storage capacity etc) or on the code side (2nd layer solutions)?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:54:31
Ya, that's what I was getting at. If BCH wants to be "visa" and handle every single transaction, with their current block size they could only handle 56 transactions/second.  Visa does 24,000/s. 
So BCH would need 3400 MB blocks to handle all those transactions. Don't see that as feasible.

Intrinsic value means value in and of itself. A dollar bill is just cotton and linen. It's what's behind the dollar \(US gov/economy\) that gives it value.
US dollar bill and Zimbabwe dollar bill have the same intrinsic value. But their governments obviously provide vastly different levels of value, hence the reflection in what people will exchange for their respective dollars.
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:16:17
But did you?
@_date: 2014-07-27 13:36:26
Why not buy property by borrowing dollars? If the dollar becomes worthless while you still own bitcoin, then buying the property today would cost little if looked at from a future bitcoin price perspective.  You're buying a hard asset for  fiat that could be worth nothing, IE property for nothing.  The increase in the value of bitcoin would offset the decrease in the property value in a crash?

Also, I don't think people are saying they are using client money but their own money to trade and add liquidity.

Not sure if you know what an ETF is if you think a bitcoin trust should be comparable in fees. 
With an ETF, the fund company is buying an asset class, usually highly liquid and easy to purchase securities. No need for specialized storage or handling of the assets.  It can be mostly automated which results in the lower fees because it doesn't need a high level of active management. 
This bitcoin trust needs to be pretty actively managed.  They buy a lot of their assets from individuals or relatively illiquid exchanges.  Bitcoins need specialized storage and security. Its unrealistic to expect 0.5% management fees as with ETFs because of the above points. Their fees are competitive with most mutual funds.
@_date: 2014-07-10 21:33:58
So anyone looking for arbitrage be an "authorized participants"?  IE I see the ETF is trading at the equivalent of  $1000/btc but on bitstamp it's only at $900.  So I sell the ETF and buy at $900.
Or is there a specific company that the Winklevoss will signup with to handle this on a much larger scale, or just do it themselves?

You can enter the address where you're regularly depositing btc into a block explorer. It's the public key so no worries about security. You can share that with anyone and no risk to them stealing your btc. However they will also be able to see the balance.

I'd say some alt-coins are scams, others are earnest efforts to create something of value.
But from what I see, most are just versions of bitcoin without any significant innovation. I haven't seen any compelling reason to use anything other than bitcoin so far.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:34:35
Only what I've read on reddit...which might be considered a dubious source of info. My understanding is the forked chain will take a while to get moving (blocks solved) because the difficulty will be at bitcoin's level, so the forked chain won't solve blocks at the normal ~10 mins pace because it has next to no hashing power. But once the difficulty adjusts then it should be at the normal pace.
So the hard fork can continue on indefinitely with any number of miners supporting it. But I don't know if that would be considered a success by bitcoin cash, or would it be # transactions, or price.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:32:34
What would be considered a successful fork? Hashrate levels? Price? Or just that the fork continues on?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:17:45

Serious question, if the bug was so plainly obvious how come it wasn't noticed by the community until recently?
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:40:15
so lets say the hardfork happens and B2x becomes the longer chain, but the price is 15% of BTC.
If I have 1 BTC = $6500 on coinbase, do I suddenly have 1 BTC = $925?

My understanding of brain wallets was that when you restore a brain wallet it has to be for the total amount in the wallet, otherwise the remainder gets included as the miner's fee (IE there is no change address created).  Though I'm thinking I'm not correct on this.

Semi fun story. I used to work at a credit card company and an elderly woman was six months past due on a huge balance, and all the items were for travel, hotels, etc. She said she had been given a few months to live, so she spent all her money and then some on taking her family to disneyland and other adventures.  Then found out the doctor was wrong and she was going to be ok.
She was so happy she didn't care about her credit card debt.
