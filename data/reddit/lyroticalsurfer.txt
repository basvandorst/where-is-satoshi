If the police really wanted to get the money back to the other party, a judge could authorize them to confiscate it and return it to the original victim. Them asking you to voluntarily give it back without getting your bitcoins back makes no sense.

Well, think about this... 
(a) You sending money back to the guy's account does not get it back to the victim, but does put it in an account that they can probably get a judge to seize.
(b) If they're asking you to put it back of your own accord, they probably do not have a strong enough case to take to a judge to seize the money. It sounds like all they can prove is that the money passed from him to you, but they can't prove the money laundering claims in a way that will stand up in court.
If they have a strong enough case against this guy, there is no reason they can't just get a judge to order the seizure of the money from your account. Next time they ask, politely tell them that you understand their position, but just can't give away that much money and take that big of a hit voluntarily. Tell them that you'd prefer that they get a judge to order it confiscated instead. Then that way you cold live with yourself. (And you'll get a good idea of they have any case against you)
What could have happened is that YOUR ACCOUNT activity triggered anti-money laundering triggers and they're just guessing who was at the other end of the transactions.
But it is very weird that any police would ask you to give the money back to anyone, especially voluntarily.
