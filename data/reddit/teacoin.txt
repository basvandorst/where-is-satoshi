Yeah and there is a simple reason why someone should not invest in something like this: it's a classic scam scheme where you get some profits and after some months the system breaks apart.

Im very unexperienced with this wallet stories so im a bit fearful with do this step of exporting anything into a hardware wallet or something like this. Can you give me some advises? Is a Ledger HW enough?

Short time sentiment has never really a logical answer. There are lots of fundamental reasons for having good hope.

LOL at least they are honest
On their FAQ:
"HOW DOES IT WORK?
The System is a classical pyramid scheme. "

The question is how does this button pressing work in the practical situation? And where and how? 
@_date: 2016-03-07 01:25:36
Yes. This was discussed in the bitcointalk forum. Its a full scam. Not paying anything.
@_date: 2016-01-11 23:01:00
I used them for years. Didnt have any problems so far.
@_date: 2016-01-12 05:52:08
The unprofessional design and the necessity of siging up  leading me to the suspicion that you just want the emails to sell them to third party. 
I dont see a reason why you would not share your charts on public. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:06:16
I thought about posting this so much times but this community is very unreglious and not very interested in these kind of analogies with religion. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 05:03:18
Yeah I also don't see any sense in that. I was just wondering how this would look.
@_date: 2016-06-01 10:39:54
I dont see any necessity in discussing that or any benefit in knowing what other persons think. It's the same kind of unknowable facts like the question about the price in xyz years.

Upwards momentum when we were at 440 Bucks. I advocated the strong support around that area. Which hold a long while and indicated me a upwards move.

In lots of subreddits supload is banned because you can profit from the content which is made by others.

But in your article the electricity costs are the essential problem that are making this unefficient. So what speaks against the advantage of my Situation of no electricity costs.

But you have to know that these kind of sites like finamar who are offering a much higher price mostly by Paypal or services where they can cancel the transaction are mostly dubious and related to money loundry and illegal activities or are fully scam.  
@_date: 2016-02-19 19:58:30
Thats a serious issue mate. There is a big psychological problem when you say that you might win your losses back. No, there is no thing like "I will do my tactics and compensate my losses" Thats a lie and the greed of the human nature which will lead you to a complete loss. So stop it now. Dont be broken because of your losts which you done until now but dont lie to yourself and risk more money because obviously you will lose it sooner or later.
@_date: 2016-02-19 18:35:34
Thats a simple ponzi scheme. They dont even have ads or something. They cannot earn and provide unlimited free money without earning something besides deposits.

Ich nehme an, dass es sich bei PK um den Private Key handelt. Bin leider nicht bewandert genug, aber damit kann man normalerweise die Coins von einem Wallet extrahieren. Das solltest du auf keinen Fall anderen weiter geben. Lass dich also bei einer Beratung nicht darauf ein, diese Informationen mit anderen zu teilen.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:09:18
Price is pure psychological. If more people want one thing, then you dont need a rational explaination for it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:32:13
I'm sorry for your cognitive bias.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:19:13
If you handle it like this then in the end everything is guessing because noone can really know what "objective information" is going to move the markets. So despite every objectivity, you have to guess the markets.

You have to remove your own emotions but you have to understand the emotions of the other ones.

And then?

If one coin is one adress, it means you can use one coin as a wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:02:03
It's not guessing. It's a way of understanding the rythm of numbers. It's kind of Pythagoreanistic understanding.

I missed lots of chances trying to wait for the right price. Since I realized this I instantly buy when I have money to invest. No regrets. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:31:39
Yeah. You have to be positive about the future to confirm my view. That's true.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:29:36
:) Blah Blah Blah tool which is making smart money for smart people. But only smart people.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:46:32
And the fact that you are replying instantly is also a proof that you cannot let an reproach stay ignored. You have the urge to answer and express that you are not caring. But that is in fact the behaviour of someone who is caring too much about the opinions of others trying to convince himself that he does not care.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:40:17
It doesnt matter, how much I buy. I bought long time ago and I buy litte amounts every month. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:12:51
Dan from San Diego. You have obviously some problems with your ego and your self esteem.

@_date: 2017-05-27 11:02:23
Yeah, in the common case you are right. But this is a conjuncture of these important points. So in the case of a bullish tendency there are 2 possibilities: 1. It will rise from here or it will touch the 61.8% level and bounces there. Buying here would be good option if someone has not time to watch the fast movements of the market and wants to go sure to have at least a small opportunity in this dip.
@_date: 2016-05-28 04:34:23
If this rise is your argument for more confidence in Bitcoin then buy. Try it out.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:41:12
I had one premise and needed a confirmation. You had no premise so you cannot conclude anything. Your self defending and "I dont care about you but I post everything publicly to share my dont-caring"-attitude is showing some deep psychological malfunctions. Your semi-aggresive answer to my reproach is just a confirmation of my premise.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:33:04
I just wanted to know if you would answer to my comment so I can see if you have truly some ego problems. Im sorry for you.

There are tons of these ponzi sites. If someone believes in something like that, then their greed is the only thing that has to be blamed.
