They didn't open with misinformation, they were explaining the drastic price drop as seen in the adjoining graphic.  The title of the article is "The Great Hiccup." I think we need a new tag for when it is clear that a commentor did not read the article, or when there is a gross failure of reading comprehension.

Just out of curiosity, do you trade Bitcoin full-time? Can I work for you?

When did the problems (plural) begin? They began in February. How do you know when many people stop reading? The article is only six paragraphs.  Unfortunately all the details can't be presented simultaneously to your liking.  The facts are there. More generally the article presents an argument demonstrating that Bitcoin is likely to suffer from problems similar to this in the future, and *that* combined with speculation could very well lead to another "big hiccup."

But this is stated in the article.

Stop projecting. You two days ago "Unfortunately people like me who have more invested in it than they should, might be missing some bills this month because of MtGox' dishonesty." Stop wasting everyone's time because you can't pay your bills. You are obviously a speculator and a part of what is described in the article.  You are the problem.

I agree that sentence taken by itself could be misconstrued by a reader, it may even be interpreted as completely false. However, in context of the entire article the actual details of the "flaw" are almost irrelevant.  The main idea-that future price fluctuations are possible to other flaws-remains true. I don't own any Bitcoin, and have no vested interest in it's success or failure. But I don't take away a more negative attitude towards Bitcoin after having read the article. I think if you seriously re-read the entire article it is very fair. Is there some " corporate agenda" here? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe you are a bit paranoid. I see why you are hyper-sensitive to any criticism of Bitcoin. But one sentence shouldn't cause such alarm, or matter much in the long term.

Third paragraph "Indeed, Bitcoin’s programmers have known about transaction malleability since 2011." The article just works out the causation of events from present to past. If you read the article in it's entirety there is no problem.

Uh no, you lost the argument a while back.

Did you actually read this article and understand it? It does not appear to be the case.
