Eh, the price of bitcoin is still $250, pretty cheap considering the overall life of bitcoin thus far.
And shit's just getting started here, so if anyone was looking for a **reason** to jump on board with bitcoin... what more reason are you looking for at this point?  How many more dominoes do you need to watch fall?

I don't see us as being seen as tools to be manipulated (though still very correct), but more like ink cartridges meant to be used and expended, and then discarded once no longer usable.
So I think we're seen more as a consumable tool... like the disposable ones that come with Ikea furniture or something.

At that point, it all comes down to who accepts what as payment.  If one is shown a lot more fair or more transparent than the other, it's going to be used.  We're live in a day and age when information about almost anything can be obtained by almost anyone nearly instantly, the days of "do corrupt, self-serving things and hope nobody notices" are simply ceasing to exist.  A lot of people just refuse to accept that though.

Quick question, which is probably a stupid one, but I'm not all that familiar with bitcoin.
What's to stop Goldman Sachs from buying say... a billion dollars worth of bitcoin, hyping the everloving shit out of it so that the price skyrockets, then dumps them all and says they changed their mind about bitcoin?  I can't see that as being anything other than both easily possible.

You clearly know nothing about me. I already spend most of my spare time making things and giving them away. I would LOVE to do that rather than spend the best hours of the day, of the best years of my life making a company that actively hates paying me more money for their higher-ups.
Yes... yes I would continue to build things for the enjoyment of building things if money were removed from the equation.

Eh, looks like 'leave it overnight' wins. Let's see what happens.
@_date: 2014-09-13 15:45:09
I'm actually lucky, and am entirely out of debt. I buy literally nothing except food, fuel, and rent for a tiny-ass old apartment, but that's why I've been able to at least get my foot in the door on Bitcoin (thanks for the tip BTW :D ).
Can't really use Bitcoin around here for much yet though. One pizza place maybe a few niche stores, or the internet (where I have used it).
A big problem is that using it in person requires a data connection, and plans be expensive, yo. Pay as you go until that shit gets more affordable (* snicker *, that'll happen anytime soon).
@_date: 2014-07-27 14:32:47

*since when did the average Joe care about decentralisation? They just want to buy their crap on Amazon and have some recourse if things go wrong.*
So what you're saying is that current systems should never be evolved because people are ignorant to what happens behind the scenes?  If they don't care how it works, and just want to buy shit on Amazon... why should they be forced to keep using the same terrible system, when potentially a far better option is available?  If they don't care either way, then if Bitcoin were to become mainstream, they would probably use that because there's fewer fees... one part of Bitcoin that they actively WOULD notice.
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:42:16
Personally, if I were in your shoes, I'd dump all except say... 10 Bitcoin or something, tell your family what happened, and accept the consequences of your actions. 
 I'm not great with either stocks or anything like that, but I know that as others have said, trading like that is the equivalent of gambling. Bitcoin may have been around for a few years, but that's still ludicrously new for an entirely new financial concept to the world.
I've got a small bit of Bitcoin, but aside from a few purchases, I'm just holding it. Investing in it of sorts, but without trying to play with numbers in hopes of squeezing the system to receive more than I put in. 
That'd basically why the stock market is so fucked... just computers looking for lower numbers and getting rid of higher numbers. Gotten so efficient that the bulk of all human wealth is piling up exponentially faster at the top of that card castle.
So... I'd stop doing that with Bitcoin for starters (I'd say stocks too, but I'm sure I'd be swamped with down votes for telling the stock market types that their entire livelihood is destroying the planet and on the verge of unavoidable, catastrophic problems).
But yeah... you're basically fucked. Stop hiding it from your family... the fact that your doing THAT should be a pretty big wakeup call that you're a gambler with a gambling problem, and this is your preferred game.
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:05:09
Exactly! Why dump Bitcoin, or unload all of your life savings into it? Why go all-the-way in either direction?
I've got some Bitcoin that I plan to hold and as you said, use and replace when I can. If Bitcoin dies, oh well, I accept that I may lose all of that invested money. 
If it doesn't die however, getting into it may be the smartest thing I've ever done.
Just... don't buy more than you can afford to lose. Not a difficult concept.
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:17:34
Ok, if you're seeing this for weeks, hows about a little explanation?  I have no clue what the hell I'm looking at, except that it's two somewhat similar graphs and a pile of arbitrary numbers.  There's no legend and no indication as to how these numbers even associate with eachother or bitcoin.
In earlier comments you said that nobody is taking you seriously.  Well here's someone proving you wrong.
I've found that it's often wisest to pay attention to the person that's taken the least seriously by others.  What am I looking at, and why is this significant?

I think what we need is more *regular* stores that take Bitcoin. Getting a sandwich? Bitcoin. Haircut, pedicure, pet food, convenience stores, dollar stores... the places poor schlubs like we all are tend to go.  THOSE need to be Bitcoin for people to want to collect and use Bitcoin.
And an absolutely dirt simple payment app. Y'know how easy it is to use USD (or in my case CAD)?
I tap my card on a plastic box.
Where the fuck is THAT?  THAT is exactly what's holding Bitcoin back the most. Why the hell would I use some complicated, high-tech 'take a picture of this barcode and pray it does something good' system when I can just tap a plastic card on a plastic box?
You know why everyone loves the Netflix idea and hates cable? Because Netflix is better and easier. Right now, Bitcoin is neither better nor easier than anything else whatsoever... and you expect people to jump on board without a moment's hesitation.

You have far too much faith in the younger generation, and zero faith in the current one.
All previous generations have been unable to 'crack' the problem that is a horrifically corrupt and broken system... I find it highly unrealistic to think that the *next* generation will finally be the one to change the system.
I've long since given up hope that those younger than me will change anything.  The system is far too broken, and far too rigged.  It's mathematically unsustainable in its current form.  You can't have record poverty, record wealth separation, and record population at the same time for long.
I give it about 2 and a half years before something breaks.  Change is coming... but it won't be because of any movement or group of protesters or positive changes to the system.  It's going to break because it has to.
@_date: 2014-09-27 13:30:22
I've taken to posting my rants about the corrupt system we live in on facebook. Everyone is scared to talk about the economy or something, so I'm starting that ball rolling (hopefully) with those I know.

@_date: 2014-09-13 15:28:18
How *much* Bitcoin would you guys recommend is a decent amount to hold? Like... .00001 Bitcoin is likely too little to do much with, but assuming I'm dirt poor and living paycheque to paycheque , what'd you recommend someone like me scrimp and scrape together to turn into Bitcoin?
This is more of a generic question so I can recommend it to friends asking about it... Currently have about 4 Bitcoin myself, can't afford any more, seeing as I AM living paycheque to paycheque.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:01:12
I figured that the point to converting at least some of your money to bitcoin is because the dollar is going to crash SO hard when the economic bubble finally collapses.
Sorry, US debt is over 17.5 trillion dollars, and is literally exponentially (albeit a tiny exponential) getting worse with absolutely zero chance of turning around.  That's just not sustainable, no matter how you look at it.  Something WILL break... that's the only possible option.  Hell if I know WHAT will break, but it'll probably be big.
So yeah... I want to get in on something not tied directly to the stock markets and economy.

So if I'm summarizing your post correctly... the single only downside that you're pointing out is "can't be reversed by an arbitrating authority".
Personally, I see that as a good thing more than a bad thing.  Yeah, you can get ripped off... but where in life can you not?  There sheer fact that there ISN'T an arbitrating authority who can make whatever changes they want to any transactions that have taken place is about the best possible thing FOR the currency.
Hell, when you get down to it, isn't that one of the best reasons for bitcoin to exist?  I mean seriously, in the vast, vast, vast majority of cases... people just want to do their business with you and get on with their lives, not rip you off.  Of all of the transactions that I've ever done, I can say that for the thousands upon thousands of transactions I've made since the advent of electronic bank anything, the number of times I've been ripped off can be counted on one hand.  Because inherently, most people are honest, and just want others to be honest with them in return.
So rather than focusing your attention on Bitcoin not being viable because of the extreme minority that is the dishonest, I'd rather focus my attention on it being viable because of the vast majority that is honest.

@_date: 2014-11-09 20:25:08
There's a reason I bought into Bitcoin and plan to hold out regardless of what happens. If it doesn't go anywhere and it dies, oh well, I lost some worthless money. Our money is worthless anyway, no great loss one way or the other.
But if it *doesn't* die, and does what it was intended to do, then it will probably be the smartest investment I've ever made in my life.

Welcome aboard.  I've been on this ship since $42, and have no plans of leaving.
Besides, if anyone asks about it, or laughs at me for buying bitcoin, I simply tell them that I've invested as much money into it as I'm willing to lose, replace what bitcoin I spend, and plan to hold on and 'see what happens'.  If I lose my investment... meh.  If I don't... it might be the next 'apple'.
That usually shuts them up.  Or gets them to ask about it more... either way.
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:14:21
The financial industry also speaks for itself. Banks don't like upsets in the system.
That said, still got some Bitcoin, got to use it a few times, and seriously, the second this shit can pay rent, buy food, and get paid in it, I'd close my bank account in a heartbeat.

Bah, the less I see any discernible difference in the economy, the less I think anything is going to change in my lifetime.
I've been holding out the vague hope that some change might come in 2-3 years, but I'm already thinking of bumping that number back up again.
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:26:07
My theory has always been:
I've pumped as much money into Bitcoin as I'm willing to lose. I don't buy much, but if I can get something I need with Bitcoin, I'll use it and top up my wallet to around the same level.  If Bitcoin dies, then I lose it all and I accept that. If it *doesn't* die however, this will probably the best investment I've ever made.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:44:54
I love how there's absolutely NO news articles posting a story of that angle.  I mean, the absolute first thing one thinks of when something like Mt. Gox happens is that it's got to be an inside job.  Whether it is or not is irrelevant, that's the first thing that comes to mind.
So the fact that no news articles (that I've read, anyway) mention it as such makes me a bit curious as to why.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:05:33
Oh yeah, none of his family will trust Bitcoin again, and likely spread word that it's terrible, rather than see the problem as being a gambler with a problem. Safe bet he'll blame it all on Bitcoin and not himself.

I don't disagree with that, however the population is still *currently* increasing, and this is will come to a head long, long before a slowing population growth has any major affect. The point still stands that there's vastly too many people for the amount of labour. Even if the global population were to this minute come to a standstill, the rest of the problems would continue to spiral everything downward.
That said, I really don't want to go through the bother of editing the rant to include that :/
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:59:15
The worst part is that now none of his family will see Bitcoin as anything other than a casino to lose money, and will spread word to avoid it :(

Well, the book I suppose is a good analogy, but otherwise every single thing on earth could have the same argument, aside from dirt and rocks you pick up for free.
But a car?  Ok, now you're not even trying.  My bitcoin wallet doesn't require maintenance, cleaning, or fuel.  It doesn't wear out.  It have it, it's there.  Assumingly, if bitcoin stays alive, it will continue to be there, without me having to pay a single extra dime into it.  There's very little in life aside from inert and useless material possessions where the same could be said about it.

You realize that all of these 'records' were like this, though not as bad, immediately before the great depression of the '30's, right?
We have instantaneous transfer of knowledge nowadays however, so I suspect the consequences of these conditions won't be as bad as it was in the '30's, but that doesn't mean it will never crash.  The financial environment is perfect right now for another massive crash... it's only a matter of when.
@_date: 2014-07-15 01:59:04
I don't really try to convince people so much as (like BaurusdB said) give them reasons why they should want to research into it themselves.
Bringing up the national debt, record separation of wealth, record average household debt (in Canada, anyway), high-frequency trading, and the blindingly obvious housing and financial bubbles is about all I do.  Mention bitcoin may prove to be useful when shit hits the fan, since at this point, sometime in the near future, that fan has no choice except to be hit.
@_date: 2014-10-11 14:42:52
Sorry guys, genie's out of the bottle now. Trying to clamp a lid on it will just make you look worse.
Course, all that matters is what's officially documented, not what everyone thinks, so it's a moot point.
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:35:11
Yeah, we really need to make a bitcoin "sound" bigger.  Nobody wants to deal with decimal places... it means having to think about math.
But yeah, I get the feeling a lot of people shrug it off since saying you're spending say... .001 bitcoins... it just sounds so minimal.
If bitcoin wants more widespread use, it has to "sound" like they have a lot.  If they put in a hundred bucks and it's like... nope, you have the equivalent of 30 cents (or whatever decimal it converts to) if you just look at the numbers without understanding it further, nobody will want to dump MORE money into there to keep getting a tiny fraction of 1.
@_date: 2015-05-28 13:19:27
I assume there's no single good solution, or at least I have no way of predicting what it might be, if there is one.  I've split my meagre savings into a few different stores of wealth... gold, bitcoin, bank, a little here, a little there.  I figure I'd cover as many bases as I could, the future could just about go any damn direction at this point.
@_date: 2014-08-24 20:43:34
"And most new restaurants go under in the first 2 years, what's your point?"
@_date: 2014-12-05 14:23:29
Well, I wouldn't count bitcoin as more expensive to use.  Far more hassle, absolutely, but really... aside from my initial outlay to actually purchase bitcoin, the actual use of it is as far as I can see free.
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:34:43
Rome wasn't built in a day man... give it time. You DO realize that Bitcoin is still ridiculously new compared to the other financial system that has worked that way for thousands of generations, right?
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:03:53
I'd probably put good money on the cop having known exactly what that was.  Otherwise, if it WAS a voice recorder, unless it was on, it wouldn't have any "evidence" on it anyway (evidence of what, I'll never know.  I was unaware burnt out tail lights gave audio notifications other than a faster turn signal clicking).
Nah, cop was just looting OP.
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:08:54
Nuke the stock market!
@_date: 2015-01-31 14:30:37
Yeah, seriously, looks like I'd fall onto the 'dormant' category since I haven't wanted to buy anything for like... 6 months that accepts Bitcoin.

Coming soon, a new tax on all computing devices.

According to the googles, The 85 richest people on earth have as much wealth as half of the global population.
85 people.  Have as much wealth as over 3.5 billion other people.
And that separation is only capable of getting bigger.
Yes, I'm the ranter.  There is no such thing as correction, only prolonging the inevitable.
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:23:29
You need to realize that not every cop is going to be as dumb as shit.
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:31:15
Oh yeah, mine would look like crap.  But a virtually FREE crap :P
@_date: 2014-12-18 05:29:02
Nah.  I put in for as much bitcoin as I'm willing to lose at this point.  If it bottoms out... meh, the dollar will probably follow not long after.  If not, might be the next 'Apple'.
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:50:58
Yeah... yeah.  There's only uppercase as far as I know.  There's punches online, but I imagine you'd probably want to get all the uppercase and lowercase at that point, so it's all the same font/etc.
Either that, or just manually scratch it in.
Or actually, I could see this almost being pseudo-encrypted... punch it in in all caps, and the letters with a 'period' punched under them are meant to be entered lowercase.
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:25:34
Awesome.  Enjoy heaven guys, it's about to become a capitolist society.

Still bunkering down and holding, let's see what the next few months brings us.
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:44:52
Could just be the pessimist in me talking, but this screams to me that they (or someone they know) want Bitcoin to go up a lot at this announcement, so that someone can unload a pile of bitcoins, and then bail, leaving it back where it was or lower.
@_date: 2014-07-25 22:27:26
Why would you deposit cash in a bank to use a debit card?
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:13:32
Word of mouth is a powerful tool. Money is just... money, and the current financial system is incapable of being sustained.
Personally, I fucking hate money. If I could exist with a roof staying over my head and a fridge that stays full of food, I would be happy as a clam to spend my days just 'making things' to give away.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:29:17
And this is why I'm glad I don't bother watching Bitcoin news all that closely right now.  All these scares and price drops and whatnot... whatever.  I've sunk in as much as I'm willing to at this point, now I ride it out until the end.  
I WILL still spend it and re-stock the bitcoin should I need to buy anything where Bitcoin is accepted, but since I'm buying very little in general right now... sitting on it like a rock.
@_date: 2015-05-27 04:49:01

[This]( rant covers it pretty good.  There's a tl;dr towards the bottom, at the numbered list.
@_date: 2015-07-04 17:30:04
I keep telling people. Today, right now, there's a WHOLE lot of Americans who are poor, starving, ashamed of their shit country, and drunk.  And today, they're supposed to celebrate that great nation.
I'm keeping my eyes on the news for the next bit. I imagine there's many things happening today that the mass media may ignore for as long as they can.
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:53:34
Wow, just... just wow.  You certainly have a terrible view of humanity... might wanna do some soul-searching there.
"There's an old man sobbing during one of the worst economic crises ever seen by those alive today.  FUCK HIM, I'm sure he deserves it."
There's zero reason to believe he obtained everything he owns illegally.  Why is your first thought to assume the worst of others?
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:39:38
And this is just the start.  If anyone thinks this ends with Greece, they haven't been paying attention.
Hope people have been reacting to the warning signs that have been everywhere for the past few years.
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:37:43
Exactly.  Just thinking about it, your fridge is empty, rent is due, you go to the bank, and are being told that your food and shelter isn't their problem.
Like... what do you *do* in that situation?  Really, all you can do is exactly what he is.  Sit down and cry, and hope that by some bizarre twist of fate, you don't die of starvation in the near future.

Thanks for the encouragement, Sally Sadness.

Personally, I'd say if the busker is capable of taking bitcoin, they'd be stupid NOT to.  Just have a bitcoin symbol and a wallet code on a sign beside you.  I'd probably slide a few bucks over if I saw that, I normally don't carry change or bills.
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:05:50
Been camping on my Bitcoin since $42, and don't plan on bailing anytime soon. I've put as much as I'm willing to lose into it, now it's time to wait and see what happens. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 14:53:59
Awesome, thanks. I've used Bitcoin a few times, and restock when I do. I just don't really need (nor can I afford) new stuff otherwise.
@_date: 2015-04-04 03:13:23
Yeah, if nothing else, us nerd types will give you Bitcoin if just to promote the use of Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:39:39
Well, there's rallies and protests... been checking out any that happen around here. Hopefully the government will start listening to the people soon.
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:08:30
Yeah, I was noticing that. Seeing all kinds of economic... *things* happening (CAD tanking, fuel prices up, oil prices down, etc), so it just seems wise to kinda watch things a bit closer for a bit. Don't know if shit's really going to start hitting a fan anytime soon, but I'm not discounting it.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:47:21
Yep.  Be proactive, and prepare for just about as much as you can, since the future could go damn near any direction at this point.
And once prepared, continue to learn, and burrow in like a tick and wait.
@_date: 2015-03-04 02:49:15
Whup, apparently just Canada.
Well, that'll teach me to just google Bitcoin price, seems it gave it to me in CAD.
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:55:20
Hell if I know, I'm not an oil exec.  I assume it's just yet another sign that everything in general is fucked up with the economy.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:52:38
I've actually gone into detail about it in a rant. On mobile for a while here, so can't link it, but I posted it in r/offmychest.
Sorry, not sure if I'm missing sarcasm or something here, I've just put a lot of thought into the subject.
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:50:30
Someone expressed a simple joy towards the technology.  KILL THEM WITH FIRE, only srs bsnss in THIS sub.
Get over yourself and let others feel joy.
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:54:47
That's why I've latched onto bitcoin like a tick.  The people complaining about bitcoin are complaining about things that have either been addressed countless times, or will come with time.
The fact that some of the big players are starting to take it seriously... some of the types that might throw big money at bitcoin to generally improve everything about it... you'd be stupid NOT to take notice of that.
I may be a dirt-poor peasant with no say in the grand scheme of things, but if I can spot an industry early enough such that I can actually get in on it before big players start making it difficult for the average person to do, then I may just be able to ride the wave that they create when they DO jump on board.
I got in at $42... let's see what happens with that a few years down the road.  Things are getting interesting on the world stage lately.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:40:45
Hey, serious question here. Bitcoin's been hovering around 250 for a while here, wasn't that long ago people said it wouldn't drop under 300. In general, what happened there, and what are the odds more drops like that might show up?
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:06:16
Man, I WISH I could pay rent in bitcoin.  The only thing I've been able to spend bitcoin on recently is gilding someone's post :/
@_date: 2015-02-14 01:35:51
Hell yes.  The weed industry isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  This shit's basically legal everywhere at this point, in that more and more places are toppling faster and faster.  S'just a matter of time before it's legal everywhere.
Which makes goddamn sense, everyone everywhere ALREADY smokes weed.  It's not like this is some subsect of society... the underground stoner movement or some shit.  No, everyone already smokes it, because it's fucking weed.  It's everywhere.  It's dirt simple to grow, it's dirt simple to buy, it's just... everywhere already.  Too bad, so sad, gonna have to suck up reality now.
So yeah, weed's here to stay, and it's going to be a crazy lucrative industry.  Everyone smokes it, everyone will buy it.  The government should be pushing this shit to be legal everywhere, the marijuana and snack industries will explode!  And Bitcoin's the future too, so let's marry the two early.
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:25:44
Oh yeah, I don't plan on bailing at any point.  What I've put in, I plan to keep going until the bitter end or more likely (hopefully), fruition.  The technology is absolutely amazing, and has world-changing possibilities.  I climbed on board at $42 for a reason.
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:48:02
Can't have dozens of groundbreaking Bitcoin articles every day, I kinda like the occasional feel good 'hey, I'm excited about bitcoins' post.
At least SOMEONE is still showing enthusiasm about it, the sub can be pretty dry and boring most days.
