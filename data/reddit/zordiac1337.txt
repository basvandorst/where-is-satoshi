because I am a developer. I need a bitcoin address with a public and private key to be able to sign transactions.
@_date: 2018-10-05 05:33:20
I created it on segwitaddress.org
However, I am starting to doubt the private key, because if I enter it into electrum it shows a different address.

it starts with an L.
Ok it shows a different public key than my public key, looks like my private key is wrong

I tried that, but as I already mentioned, Electrum shows 0 Balance and no transactions.

Hi, thanks for the suggestions. [coinb.in]( doesn't work with my private key and if I use the bitcoin core client, I have to download the entire blockchain. Aren't there any more convient ways to do that?

Im starting to doubt that I have the right private key.
When I go to [bitaddress.org]( it shows me an address starting with 1, even though I created a segwit address starting with 3

Hi elementjj,
the first 3 wallets are totally free. After that, there is a little fee to get unlimited number of wallets. Segwit addresses are supported.

are you using iphone or android? on android simply update the app, then the first 3 wallets are free and you can test your xpub keys. on iphone you have to wait 2 hours, the app is still processing.
