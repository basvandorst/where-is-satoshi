when I say random, I mean random, like nameless nobodys, its gone, I can only hope they held onto them and helped perpetuate the current user base. shoulders of giants and all that.

it will be a 10-15k dip tho, I'd rather lose 1k potential profit, than gamble 15k,
notice the threads like this have increased, this is the beginning of the tide turning.

they were given to me, as payment for work and I didn't take them seriously, sure they were worth that amount but at the time its like saying i had 900$&lt; worth of magic beans

in fairness, we have to remember, those lost HDD's, those people giving currency away, helped stabilise the currency and diversify it. it got people interested and the derelict currency created stability, if everyone who "sold" when they shouldn't didn't it may not have gone anywhere, for better or worse everything that happened got us here.

random fucking people on IRC, it was a silly time.

thats the thing, you can't live life wondering what if, because while hindsight is 20/20 , you can never foretell its full effects. maybe if people like me weren't giving it away BTC never would have succeeded as much as it has.
maybe, if people didn't lose hdd's, the currency would lack stability.

web designer = carl from IT who doesn't have a degree in anything and was granfathered in because his dad is an owner and he fix's the PC at home so thats good enough. Not to knock carl of course, he knows the hardware inside and out and is the only one who can maintain the legacy As400 because everyone else who did is now dead. But, not carls fault, he just isn't a webdesigner, However IT doesn't make the company any money, so they won't invest in training, newer tech or any more staff. Carl should be grateful because he has a job that requires 10 years experience, 4 degrees and 10 people, but still pays below minimum wage, because he is an intern.

Privacy - Information gathering is the new shield and spear race. the thing is we had privacy for a very long time and don't want to lose it...but now they have the lead they are claiming that if we have privacy once again bad things will happen. before they started gathering info, the world didn't go to shit, so they can't claim that it would happen based on previous events.

He may have had a large wallet, and thought the change in the market, the spike, could be profitable too.

may I ask, what made you take the risk, I don't know the people in this community too well, what if he didn't come through or why did you expect him to?
