There will be a correction very soon and my comment will be down voted quickly. Sell now and buy the dip. 
I warned you.

Things need to drop for them to go up higher. Nothing has ever gone up forever and nothing ever will. Even Gold has crashed in the past. 
A drop will be good for BTC on the long run.
Do not be surprised if you lose thousands of dollars in the next few days.
Be patient but vigilant. You will have a great buying opportunity soon.
Sell and do not hold USDT/Tether only real USD!
(I saw the amount you invested) 
Its your life's savings think it through...

It has to happen. If doesn't happen BTC will have a horrible crash, and will take 2-3 years for it to recover. It already happened before. 
Nobody knows what will really happen, but everyone knows how painful it is to lose large amounts of money. 
Good Luck.

If this is truly what Bitcoin can become (and the fees are lowered) it will destroy ALL of its competitors.
