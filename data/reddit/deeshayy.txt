Definitely a learning curve! BTC and other cryptos are a new beast to the game. Way different than trading stocks and derivatives.

Yeah I agree. I think eventually the volatility will level off and have a small growth rate. Once there is a steady amount of transactions happening daily in the global economy. There will be exchanges,  like Coinbase, in every city. Meanwhile, until that happens, the growth in transactions will make the price take off. Along with all the money dumping into the currency from pension funds and ETFs. It will be interesting to see what happens with it all. I'm glad I get to be involved in the "start" of a huge change in history.

I use Trezor wallet. You hold the keys to your coins, which is nice. An exchange like Coinbase holds your keys, so if something happened to the exchange, you could lose your coins. I would recommend Coinbase for sure though. It's American and based out of San Francisco and pretty safe. GDAX is also good for trading frequently. GDAX is owned by Coinbase, so it's also safe.

I used electron cash to claim them originally. So, just send them back and try to claim BCH again? Lol, I get nervous sending coins to different wallets because of situations like this.

BTC is very volatile, so you need to realize there are huge moves and be comfortable with it. Like other people said, Hold and keep it as a long term investment. It will pay off! If you have expenses that need to be paid, then sell and reinvest later.

Lol! Day trading in BTC is sketchy because the volatility. You don't know if it will jump to another new high. This will cause you to be behind and make you come up with extra money just to get back in. 
Holding is the best option, unless you know how the price of BTC usually moves. Usually, makes new highs, gets a lot of publicity, then drops. That's what has happened in the past, but making historical assumptions are never certain.
