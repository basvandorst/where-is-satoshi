The bitcoin core code is C++, but there's enough service based code to make Python worthwhile (and much easier to start with).

Agreed.  I had a number of functional issues and ended up getting a refund when I had issues with firmware update process that made it unusable.  Cool concept, but in the end it seems like a thoroughly compromised implementation.

I gave that a try with a faux-21 pi and it seems like their API endpoints were entirely based on funds that exist off the blockchain.  The initial account setup creates a wallet so I transferred about $1 worth a satoshis in, but there didn't seem to be a way to transfer from the blockchain based addresses to their microtransaction address (although you could transfer the other way).
@_date: 2015-12-03 00:24:05
In the initial release (the one one I looked at) that's pretty close to correct.  Their microtransactions themselves occurred off the blockchain, and were only "flushed" to the blockchain when explicitly called.  You could transfer funds to the bitcoin blockchain, but couldn't do the reverse.  Take all that with a grain of salt as my code dive didn't go terribly deep.

Yes and no.  I preface this by saying that I own an HW1 and a Nano and think they're a excellent products, but I that recognize there are certain edge cases where the Trezor may be more secure.  That said, they're edge cases and there are there are a couple advantages the Ledger has over the Trezor as well.  For me it came down to price.  I feel like the Ledger has 99% of the security of the Trezor and I just don't hold enough bitcoins to make buying a Trezor worthwhile.  If someone is using crazy 0-days to infect the machine I'm using to initialize my Ledger and have the ability to seed the device with compromised data, communicate it back to themselves, and steal my bitcoins they're going to be VERY disappointed to learn their return on investment is very low when they see my balance isn't in the triple digits.  
Ledger makes great products, available pretty inexpensive, and are plenty secure for what I consider non-investment quantities of Bitcoin.  If you're new to bitcoin I'd say consider them if you're looking to spend on a hardware wallet.  If you wear a tinfoil hat outdoors or are holding you life's savings in bitcoin Tezor may be worthwhile.

What kind of router are you using?  It's shouldn't be too difficult (especially if the router supports UPnP).
@_date: 2017-01-20 20:49:03
Yeah, you'll probably need to do that since the hole you poke in the firewall needs to line up with the IP of your node.  Either associate the MAC address of your node with a specific IP assigned via DHCP in the router, or change the configuration of your node so it uses an IP outside of the DHCP range of the router.

One thing to add, it usually doesn't matter to the consumer but it can matter a great deal to the retailer.  The fees for debit card transactions can sometimes be half of what they are for credit cards. A lot of POS systems default to debit card processing now if they can, asking for a PIN that you have to cancel to process as a debit card because they want those lower fees.

The part the clickbait title omits: In San Francisco or New York city. All the sudden it sounds a whole lot less scary.

Google owns Motorola’s former cell phone division. Motorola the company (now) still makes radios, microprocessors, etc.

That seems like an expensive test case.
@_date: 2015-11-21 15:30:09
Are you trying to install their software on a pi or are you trying to interface their hardware to another computer?  It sounds like you're running the client-side script (setting up another computer to talk to the 21 computer) and not the install script.  The script you're talking about was mistakenly referred to as the install script by a couple topics here on reddit.  You need the other one.
@_date: 2015-11-21 04:36:38
From what I can see their software stack (at least in it's first iteration) is based on creating a mostly off-chain micropayment based marketplace.  You publish an API for other users, and they transparently pay for serviced API calls.  The weird part is that the ecosystem seems pretty closed at this point.  I haven't figured out a way to transfer bitcoins from other sources in to their closed environment, but a lot of that may have to do with not being able to bootstrap the system with mined or borrowed bitcoins since I don't have their fancy ASIC.  Still, it's a pretty slick system if you completely ignore the lock-in aspect.  I could see it kickstarting development of a couple concepts, especially with transactions small enough to be incurring dust transaction fees on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:38:39
Way to jump to conclusions....
I'm pretty sure they're referring to the post I made about adding a bit to the install script to ignore the signing check on 21's apt repo:
That isn't anywhere close to the anti-circumvention clause present in the DMCA.  21's repo is (still) completely open to the public, and the files can be downloaded with no issue.  The apt package manager does not allow installed from unsigned repositories by default, and 21's PUBLIC key is not installed by default.  The script modification is to tell apt you're OK installing software from an unsigned source, and is essentially the same as clicking on the warning Windows displays when you attempt to run an unsigned executable.
If asking politely to install from an unsigned source is punishable by up to 20 years we're going to need a LOT more prisons.

Convinced me to replace my HW1 with a Nano.  Solid product.
@_date: 2015-11-23 02:08:56
Very helpful, thank you.  A couple things I noticed:
- Your device seems to have a signal strength indicator during the update process.  I'm assuming this is something that was added after the initial firmware release (that I think I'm on).
- When going through the diagnostics my modem test took forever, and eventually failed.  I'm assuming this is due to having a poor signal (or the modem being otherwise nonfunctional).  
- Even after running the diagnostics if you encounter an update failure you go right back into the update process.  The initial firmware is gone, and until you complete you still can't get into a normal operating mode.  Bummer.
I'm going to try bringing my Case back to my office tomorrow and re-running the diagnostics to see if I get a better result from the modem test, but at the moment it's still fit for weighting papers and little else.
@_date: 2015-11-25 04:23:03
I gave up on it this evening.  The guys at Case have been great about trying to debug the update problems I had, to the point that they whitelisted my device so I could go back to the original firmware and then modified the transactions sent by my device by hand so their system would accept the now-invalid pre BIP66 signatures so I could get my bitcoins off the device.  As soon as I tried to update again so I could use the device normally it hung up, though.  I even tried from the same spot in a gas station parking lot I was able to download the original firmware from this morning.  No dice.
I wish things had worked out differently, but given the issues I've had Case is honoring my request for a refund.  
@_date: 2015-11-21 04:09:34
I played around for this a bit but initially ran into a problems downloading packages from the 21 repo as I didn't have their gpg key installed.  If anyone can find a copy please let me know.  In the mean time changing the line in the install script to ignore the GPG check seems to work:
echo "deb [trusted=yes] $APT_URL $APT_DIST main" &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/twentyone.list
@_date: 2015-11-27 01:06:45
Probably (especially now when the price of the Zero is abnormally high due to limited support), but if you're planning on going wireless you'll need a USB adapter anyway.
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:46:21
You may be able to make sure your identity isn't associated with the account directly, but Case (or anyone who subpoenas their data) will be able to link all the transactions you've ever made together in a way that can be fairly difficult to do through blockchain analysis if someone takes the right precautions.  If you're using bitcoin for anonymity Case may not be the product for you, but in general it's a lot less information than a credit card company would keep so I'm not really concerned for my own personal use.
@_date: 2015-11-28 22:28:19
Just an FYI, on the surface this does seem to disable most of the 21 executable functions for those that have installed the two1 package in a non-21 Pi:
You need a 21 Bitcoin Computer (21.co/buy) to access this service. If you believe you have received this message in error, please contact support
I haven't looked into how deeply those checks are burrowed yet.
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:50:41
Take what I said with a grain of salt, as I'm not an expert on the product.  I'm just a guy who's messed with one for a few weeks.  There may be other options available I'm not aware of.  I still think it's a cool product overall, and I intend to keep using it as a hot wallet for small amounts of bitcoin.  That said, I wouldn't use it for more than you can easily afford to lose unless the company can really prove themselves trustworthy.  
@_date: 2015-11-21 04:14:47
I haven't spent a lot of time with my faux-21 setup, but the system definitely seems to be able to tell that it's not official hardware.  The 21 mine command aborts (makes sense since their mining ASIC isn't available) and running a status check returns one failure for "Bitcoin kit not detected".  Most of the capabilities seem to be there, however.
@_date: 2015-11-12 01:34:00
I agree with you for the most part, but there is something to be said for the efficiency of the ASIC miner component.  The common Block Erupter part runs around 300M/s.  If the specs are to be believed 21's setup runs 100-300 times the hash rate.  As a dev platform it doesn't seem like the hash rate should be terribly significant if the end goal is to enable development of bitcoin based applications, but there is a difference.  
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:31:20
From what I can tell, no.  The device is hardcoded to talk only to Case's servers, and when those go down the device is a paperweight.  To make matters worse you can get the third key out of escrow, but with no way to extract the key embedded in the device without a connection to the outside world and the key stored by Case gone your Bitcoins are gone.  I have a Case wallet, but the company going down is the scenario that has me using a Ledger for main storage. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 01:24:52
Dev kits being orders of magnitude more expensive than the parts they showcase is nothing new (I've worked on plenty of micros where the I/O connectors were 20x more expensive than the processor itself), but usually it's clearer what the development kit is targeting.  If I buy a $700 ARM dev board from ST I know I can build a platform based on ST's hardware.  21's value-add here is a little nebulous, though.  There's a software stack that seems to mostly be the bitcoin core code, a copy of the blockchain that can be downloaded easily once you get the core bitcoind up and running, and a fairly efficient (but still nowhere near the scale required for most of the applications being discussed) ASIC for bitcoin mining.  There isn't a terribly clear view of what 21's eventual product will be that this dev kit enables.  If it's mostly a dev kit for the existing bitcoin software stack then I'm not sure what all the hype is about.

Does the router have UPNP enabled?
@_date: 2015-11-21 03:26:02
I've got a Tylt Vu I've been using.  It seems to be a lot more reliable (and generate a lot less heat) than the included charger.  Using either one seems to result in an error, however.
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:39:05
I have one of the early units, and you're probably better off.  Since trying to update to the firmware that was released last week I've run in to a series of problems that's rendered mine unusable.  Case is replacing it (no worries there), but waiting for an already updated unit might be in your best interest.
@_date: 2015-11-12 02:35:59
Not really.  The RPi2 doesn't really support UHS-1, and the max throughput tops at 20-25 Mbps.  UHS-3 would be totally unutilized.
@_date: 2015-11-20 16:32:14
Awesome, I'd appreciate any input you can provide.
@_date: 2015-11-12 03:02:36
*It will eventually pay for itself, and offer some diversity on the network.*
I disagree with both of those points.  This device will NEVER pay for itself, as it will take over 7 years to ROI at the current difficulty levels, and difficulty is going up fast.  That's before you start to consider the electricity this device will consume which can easily push the value proposition negative.  The decentralization angle is also somewhat dubious, as 21's long term plan seems to involve locking users of their embedded devices into their mining pool with no ability to control the mining process.  That seems like the opposite of decentralization to me.
@_date: 2016-05-10 19:57:31
In this case the merchant just sees the transaction as another credit card and gets hit with the fee anyway.  So yeah, it's an additional fee that you the consumer gets to pay and the merchant has absolutely no incentive to offer you a discount.
If we were talking about a true Bitcoin transaction there would be an incentive, but not in this case.
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:44:06
It seems like at best this delays dealing with the problem as memory density isn't advancing nearly as quickly bitcoin adoption.  At worst it contributes to the death of decentralization by requiring high end hardware to verify transactions.
@_date: 2015-11-27 01:12:55
I agree, their support has been great.  I ended up putting way more effort than it was worth trying to get the device back into a usable state, though.  If the purchase price had been lower I would have been willing to put up with a bit more, but for $200 I expected a product that made bitcoin transactions easier.  The actual experience tended to be more the opposite.
Hopefully they'll continue getting better and maybe I'll give the second generation of the Case wallet a try.
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:43:22
Agreed.  The mention of the PGP key shows a complete lack of understanding of the issue.
@_date: 2015-11-22 22:51:43
Not sure I follow your reasoning on the lock-in.  This is software that's only available to run on proprietary hardware, not hardware that will run only specific software.  You can totally run Windows 10 IoT on a 21 bitcoin computer if you want to.  
@_date: 2015-11-21 15:25:47
It's more like if Apple only only allowed their software to run on hardware they sold.  Oh wait, that's totally what they do...
The issue isn't that so much that their software doesn't run other hardware, it's that there really isn't much to the software to justify buying their hardware.  The solution there is easy, just don't buy the hardware and use something else.

It looks like their search radius is just REALLY short (as in 10 miles or less). I was trying for a regional view and they really don't want to give one to you unless you search every zip code or city in the area individually.
