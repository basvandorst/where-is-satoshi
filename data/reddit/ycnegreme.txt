The words for the bet appear to be:
"Just bet Kane Kalas 1k that bitcoin will hit $2,000 before it hits $200"
There's different output scenarios by this:
1)  Hits 200, doesn't hit 2000.
2)  Hits 200, hits 2000.
3)  Hits 200, never hits 2000.
4)  Hits 2000, doesn't hit 200.
5)  Hits 2000, hits 200.
6)  Hits 2000, never hits 200.
For it to be an 'official' win you need to hit, both, 200 and 2000.  There's states 3 and 6 which, oddly, should result in the bet being a "draw".

Isn't this like too early to say he won?
He can only say he won if the 2,000 mark is reached.  Otherwise it's a premature assumption.
Edit:  This this get bandwagoned down due to the implied assumption that it won't reach 2k because the only thing implied is that it hasn't reached 2k yet.

Won't really matter with new patents.  Patents that are pre-AIA may matter.  However, those should be few and far inbetween with respect to Cryptocurrency.
In late 2011, or so, the AIA was enacted.  It effectively changes US patent law from "first to invent" to "first to file."  However, you only get a patent if you're "first to file" and "first to publish/disclose."  If someone published before then you obtaining a patent is problematic and unlikely to be upheld in court - tentative of the lawyer you hire.  
Guess what the beauty of open source is?  The code is "published" to the public.  You can't take something from the public domain and call it yours. 
Good luck to trolls on post-AIA infringement.  Furthermore, I believe 35 USC 273(a) outlines defenses to patent infringement.  I'm not sure if those are pre-AIA or post-AIA defenses ... however, either way, if you're worried about Patent Trolls in the distributed software edited by thousands it's borderline stupid.  If it is open source it's likely, due to AIA, it won't be patented. 
HOWEVER, it'd be interesting to know if there is a pending suit for Patent Infringement against one of his employers.   If so, there may very well be an ulterior and unhonest motive if he's not being upfront.  Furthermore, if you close source your software someone can patent it.  Trade secrets of one company can be patented by another if they invented them.  However, they are unlikely to be enable the patent against the trade secret holder due to 273.

[WIPO Application](
So the Chinese applications has a PCT   	PCT/CN2016/077996 which is published as WO/2017/012371.  The prosecution at the PCT level can be found [HERE](
It seems like the US is designated as a state but was not published in English.
What's interesting is that we should be seeing National Stage applications for this PCT sometime between 3 months from now and a year forward.  The National Stage can be filed in any office representing the designated states.
It would be interesting to see what the will happen at the PTO based on prior art searches.  [THIS]( document shows the prior art found by the PCT examiner.

I strongly recommend you leave the USA by denouncing your citizenship and move to the Congo.

I wish people would realize that yes, the government didn't help you with mining bitcoins.  However, it did make sure you aren't born in the equivalent of the Congo and die or not have access to best of technology.
The government needs to pay for different things.  Military, public services, police, hospitals, research, jails, etc were all paid for government that as a citizen you used directly or indirectly.  All those opportunities cumulated in finding bitcoin and using bitcoin to you success.  People don't realize how lucky they are to be born where they are born to have the opportunities they have in a 1st world country when they could have just as easily been born in a 3rd world country.
Maybe they should be dropped off in the middle of Afghanistan with their cyrptosteel.  See how they fend for themselves and get the bitcoins sold?  Clearly, the infrastructure that's present in the USA was already paid for.

I'm sorry but I never said the US is entitled to people's money.
I said the government of your respective country is entitled to the taxes that they normally charge as long as you're a citizen.  Otherwise, you should get the fuck out.  Society of your respective country dictates what it needs to support itself.  Not you.
Finally, the USA would be a madhouse if there was no government.  It'd be worse than a 3rd world country.

I don't think its the Swiss banks that made it difficult for "US Persons."

Right.  
Change the issue something else in your analysis.  You're effectively "blaming the victim."  I'm not sure how you can justify that when generally that is a poor argument.
Just because someone people understand that they are being used and other's don't doesn't make it OK for others to be used.

I'm not really sure how "free" someone is when they have a have a 10,000-60,000 car they need to make payments for to drive under Uber.  I'm not feeling sorry for them but clearly this is a problem.  There's a reason why driving a limousine/taxi is so regulated in NYC.
I realize someone "has free will" to decide whether they work or don't work for Uber.  However, once someone purchases a car specifically to drive for Uber (e.g., Uber black) you're no longer "free."  You're now tied to the car.  
So yea, you can ignorantly call it "free to do whatever you want to."  However, there is one freedom.  That's Uber's freedom to drop you as a driver when the sky is too blue.
Bitcoin is different than Uber.  Uber has a specific ownership.  Bitcoin doesn't.  This completely obfuscates the single point where money goes when considering Bitcoin.  Not so with Uber.  
Even though uber has a specific ownership Uber doesn't even know what it is.  Uber isn't a "car sharing service."  Nor is it a "taxi service."  It's a convoluted legal mess that doesn't know what it is.  Uber doesn't take any financial asset risks.  It asks its contractors to take all the risk and also expects special treatment from regulation.

Clearly I said it would be for the courts to decide - especially the gimmick disclaimers.  
Whether or not the wheels of justice are slow is irrelevant.  How they turn is irrelevant.  It's amazing how people are concerned about "slow wheels of justice" yet take so long to file suits, if any.

There's a clear difference between couple thousand dollars in car wash tokens stored physically versus token stored online the tens of millions.

Just because a sign says "Not liable" doesn't mean "Not liable."  It's more of a sign they can point at and they we're "Not liable."
For example, you'll see many times signs on parking lots that say "Not liable for car damage."  At some grocery stores you'll see signs saying "Caution:  Wet floor - not liable for damage."
Most of those signs are not legally enforceable.  Those signs are there so that those who are "good citizens" get pointed at the sign.  80-90% of the time the sign discourages legal action where there is merit on the case - either supported by statute or not.
Just because Bitfinex says something on their website doesn't mean it's what they say.

Actually, I think what he said is "Into betraying fairly well off US customers who may or may not pay huge amounts of tax to the tyrannical majority, who are on welfare, etc."

There is no US patent as far as anyone knows.  Unless you can show a Pre-Grant Publication or a patent application number you can't presume there is a Patent.  As far as I'm aware all information suggests to the contrary - no US patent.  There is, however, a Chinese patent.  
Finally, the letter talks about provisional rights.  It doesn't talk about a US patent application much less a US patent.  The letter could be related to the Chinese patent, though.

Just received one similar.  Looks like new fishing attempts.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:37:55


What interests me is whether a secrecy order can be made to an application that stems from a PCT.  If not then it'd have to be a child of the US provisional application.
The secrecy order thing sounds interesting but I've never seen it and don't have much knowledge on those procedures.  It'd be interesting to find out if non top-secret items that become top secret could be removed from the public's view.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:52:01
The application doesn't appear to have entered the National Stage in the US (Actually, I don't believe it can enter US National Stage or any other National Stage at this point).  Per the WIPO website, initial review of the claims resulted in all the claims being rejected.  This means that even if the application somehow enters the national stage it won't receive expedited examination under the Patent Prosecution Highway Pilot.  
Therefore, let's say this application does enter the US national stage examination won't begin until 2020, or so. (Again, I don't believe it can)
Provisional Patent Rights?  I'm not really sure if the letter can be identified as notice.  It's directed at the world and no specific entities.  Furthermore, the claims would need to be allowed and would need to be allowed in substantially the same form they're in right now (see claims here   
What does this mean?  It's likely this is a fishing expedition.  They still need to obtain a patent (I'd reason they can't as they can't enter the US National Stage probably) and now that people can identify the application they can submit prior art and arguments to the different patent offices worldwide.
The documents in question appear to be:
WO/2015/077378 (Publication of PCT/US2014/066470; 
61/906,310 (US Provisional Application)
EP3095044 (A1) 
KR20160106570 (A) 
CN106415530 (A)   (
In my opinion the application owners should identify publically their intention.  Once the intention is know (e.g., litigate against Jihan in some way - looking for a segwit settlement maybe?)  then the community should decide if it'd be worth assisting them or having a negative response.  Until then it's unknown what the purpose of the notice is and even questionable that their notice is proper notice - there's a reason why service of notice exists in the USA.
EDIT:  Jihan application in China:   .  What's interesting is the Jihan application in China was FILED 5 months AFTER the publication of the PCT application.  Coincidence?  Probably not.  But you maybe can use this information to invalidate the Chinese patent.  Possibly depending on prior art statutes in China.
EDIT 2: Timo's patent in China is real with priority back to 2013. It appears searching through the Chinese website it won't show up in searches (No idea why. Was no maintenance fees paid? Is it still valid if not in searches? Search engine isn't update on SIPO website [has a 2016 update date]? International websites show it, though). See Timo (CN106415530A) vs Jihan (CN105245327A) at  and  respectively.
If Timo has a Chinese patent with better priority why hasn't there been any drama being heard about litigation between them in China? I'm really curious. It seems they have a reasonably solid case to force Jihan to pay a lot of money in China.
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:47:01
It seems like the Timo patent for ASICboost has, at least, an application in China.  That application has significantly better priority.  If I understand that correctly it means even if Jihan has a patent/application they can get invalidated somehow through Chinese Patent Office or the courts.

Whether they like it or not you only need 1 piss poor incident to put a stain on your name.  How they dealt with the community that time was the biggest bullshit I've seen.
