I agree. I like the gray background with the color coin. Makes the logo stand out more and not as much eye burn with a desaturated background. Annnd the orange text should go.

But I would also say that if the government didn't dangle the carrot stick for banks there'd be more efficient and responsible banks, better private insurers to handle such situations, and alternative ways to ensure our money is secure should a bank fail.

With Bitcoin being a digital currency, and with us living in 2013, why not make a card with some technology in it? [Maybe a digital screen to show how many Bitcoins you have?](

Could really see a boost if used in a project [like this](

Yeah. Not entirely worthy, but mainly just to point out how the media will lash into Bitcoin anytime anything happens and blame the currency, when it's happened to traditional currency since it's inception.

What about Bluetooth connectivity to your smartphone? Or updated at the cashier register when funds are deducted?

A few thoughts on that...
1. If you think the banking industry was a free market back then, you're sorely mistaken.
2. Sure. All authoritarian societies can point to reasons why they've enacted rule over certain areas, but it doesn't make it correct.
3. Much of the Great Depression got its beginnings in the 1920s with the Federal Reserve making credit easy (Ahem... housing bubble anyone?), causing a credit-driven boom that improperly inflated stocks and eventually crashed.
So the government is implementing a system, that creates bank dependence with strings attached, to "fix" a problem it helped create. When the best thing it could do is simply govern. If politicians want to make money more available to people, they need to be in banking...not politics.

I will say that having more than 2 digits after the decimal makes it a little tougher for people to wrap their head around. Hopefully the fact that it's all digital (therefore letting computers do the math) will relieve some of that, though.

Which is why we need a government that first respects the rights of the people and can't force their social/political ideas on us. Then no matter how much money is thrown at a politician, there's no power for them to do anything.

While much of what you said are valid cases for concern, I think digital currency is the future and Bitcoin is laying the groundwork. Will Bitcoin be reigning champion in 5 or 10 years? Who knows. Maybe someone else comes out with something better...easier...more secure.
No currency is perfect. Government currency is even proof of that. There's counterfeiting, there's inflation, etc... But I think private, digital currency is the future. No more intervention for the government to make the currency what they want it to be.

I've been using BitMinter and seems to be working ok! Haven't used any others, though.

Krugman isn't correct about most of the things he says, yet people still look to him for economic advice. I don't get it.

I think this is big news, too. You're taking one of the most widely accepted and open standards (HTML) and adding Bitcoin support standard in it. Not to say everyone will use it, but it should make using it a hell of a lot easier and therefore make it more appealing.
