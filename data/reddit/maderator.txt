Honestly, if there’s a collapse, people invested in crypto who are affected are gonna cash out to pay mortgages or business creditors . I’ve been waiting for a brexit crash for 1.5 years and all I got was a nice dip in the pound for sweet Amazon shopping.

Banks allow people to buy houses and cars and businesses with borrowed money. I support bitcoin, but what if this is no longer possible, how will people buy a half million dollar house?

Things have been mostly stable for a hundred years. There’s the occasional bloodshed but that’s normal. It was worse before modern banking and fiscal policies stabilised western nations. 
A global currency makes this worse really, because an economic collapse of a single digital currency will affect every person on earth at the same time. And It removes barriers for the ultra rich to manipulate foreign nations and economies.

This explains how poor countries in extreme conditions of economic collapse could benefit from BTC, but for the rest of the world, that example doesn’t apply.

Bitcoin is an appreciating currency though, so the rich will spend 5% of their net earnings to live and use the rest to accumulate more bitcoin. The poor will be forced to spend a higher percentage (as is true now) putting more in the market for the rich to purchase. This moves an increasing percentage into the hands of the wealthy. This makes bitcoin bad for the poor and middle classes. Can anyone explain in simple terms less than 100 words why this theory is wrong?

Now let us compare this to crypto currency!

I found Roger Ver’s Reddit account yesterday. Check out user MemoryDealers post history. Such bitterness.

That’s like saying the vast majority of dotcom businesses in the late 90s are dead so only one will survive.
