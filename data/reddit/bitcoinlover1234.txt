I dislike islam because of some of their views, but I love them for pumping money into it making this huge spike today more permanent and its gonna keep it flowing up and up and up till they get too the moon first.

Shit, I sold at all the way from 200-6500 (besides bought in last night at the dip a few grand and then sold it off and also bought some from CB that won't hit my account til a few days). Too think of it, I have traded over 200+ btc since I started... Only if I would've fuckin held on I would be a multi millionaire :-\
Oh well, fug it.. I still made enough to travel around the world (which I am currently doing at the moment typing from south america) and can play the markets at dips along with my buy in every 2 weeks from CB.

I am so glad I bought in before it was announced :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:57:48
I bought at 200 sold at 500 bought at  600 sold at 1k bought at 1.2 sold at 3.2 rebought back sold at 6 then bought back in around 15 and bought a few LTC around 220ish which I am still holding.. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:32:57
I am currently. But sometimes these bastards will bill me, make me wait weeks, then reverse it when I receive it so if it went down that’s a +1 but if it went up, that’s sucks.. Also been having issues sending. I send one from $250-3k. Never sell back to them and there rates are shit so it’s hard to catch them market level.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:49:36
only if marty and his time machine were real :-\
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:01:26
Shit, I sold out a few months ago :-\ But I did buy 3k worth yesterday when it was around 14,200k from LBC and sold 2/3rd's of it &amp; bought several hundred worth at 15k(which will hit my account in freaking days... Well it will cause me to at least not sell it) from Coinbase yesterday :)
Eh, I still have around $600 worth and another $550-600 coming in from CB. I will reinvest if I see a hard dip like that again. Plus I have enough fiat to travel the world(which I am doing now, typing this from south america) and I can play(buy/sell) the dips and still have around 1k +/- right now holding.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:29:03
I was a HODLer from 2014 till around 5-6k :-\ oh well I have bought back in and am continuing to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:49:08
I let it sit and never touched it and now it won't even let me log in or reset my password!
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:03:06
Lol what a waste.. Were there at least free hookers you could throw your paper QR codes at?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:48:34
Stole my litecoin and won't let me log in. I bought .5 worth back when it was fucking .50!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:13:15

@_date: 2017-12-11 23:17:47
Fuck the bank, I buy my stuff out right.

If it aint hodl bitcoin it aint right :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:21:50
Lols.. I think coinbase is gonna cancel my buy for 3800 at 13,410.. I am worried :-\ slicky fuckers.. I am still waiting on my $450 to be sent from there greedy servers to my wallet.. Its already been +6 hours.. I made that buy among many others around the 14k range. Bank is around ummm -5k lol so I gotta fix that in the A.M. 
Good story today though, I bought 1.8k worth at 14,200! :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:32:57
I am here with you.. I have sold over 250+ btc on 1 market alone since 2011 :-\ I feel like a fucking retard for not being rich as fuck but then also a spartan warrior when I hit the dips right and buy in and sell off making a few g's(along side keeping some of course)
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:43:26
I’ve had to do that exactly afew times when my girlfriend asks about my bitcoin hahah if I told her I lost 1800$ gambling yesterday she’d fucking flip
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:42:39

Ermm I think your wrong there but right in some ways.. Ive sold over 250+ btc since 2011 and have enough money to travel worldwide and I am typing as I am in another country tambien, But... Playing with bitcoin for this long I have a good stash of bills and other goodies at my disposal and it taught me a lot about saving/buying and selling the dips among many other things. Yes, I would be a multi millionaire but I am still content to what bitcoin has brought me so far in life :)

I quit working at the time mt.gox crashing. I put 2k into bitcoin at 197/coin. I margin traded over 200+btc from then till late 2015. I had a good amount of fiat as I was cashing out and I went and traveled most of the world. Since then I am just holding onto my 1 BTC I have in my wallet which is more than most have surprisingly. I still have a lot of money in fiat, money in the bank and some other coins to diversify alongside my 1 BTC. I still haven't had a real job besides trading since maybe late 2013/2014. I heard about bitcoin when it was .50-$1.00 but I thought it was a scam then I heard of the mt.gox thing then I decided to invest and started on LBC buying -5/-10% and selling at +5-10% and making solid returns. I made 180k the first year doing it. every year after I was making close to 6 figures or barely more than 100k+. Too let you in on a little secret. I am under 28 and I never went too college and I make more than anyone I know IRL my age.

not times 5x but 250$+ sale for 5k

I see bitpay would work, but is there any referrall fee I could set up based on amount X how many transactions?
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:59:54
Bitquick has some good prices sometimes 
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:02:06
Haha, tell them its for your future. You will be the future of bitcoin one day young padiwon. We need you on the force. Also yes I know, 180 :( fucking blows my mind how its gone up too what it is now meanwhile in 2013-2015 I was only margin trading where if I would've held and now sold I'd be fucking rich... fucking dumb..
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:49:34
Fiat will always be worth $ but unlike bitcoin it doesn't go up in value. Plus there is the QE inflation among many other things that can affect USD worth. I hold onto my 1 btc and 16-20k fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:14:49
The chinese are going out of oil and slowly fazing into more electric. From what I've read lately they only make electric cars now and have completely quit with oil production.

PM'd you incase you may need help!
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:37:43
Hah I've read too many cases about people who did just that and got taken down by the Feds.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:38:46
How can I do that? I have my coins on a online wallet (blockchain) at the moment. How can I split it and with what wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:12:54
So when it splits what do you recommend? Also what wallet will be best to keep my bitcoin on until the split and then I can split it myself and sell off the shitty coin that it puts into my OG bitcoin so I can profit and make returns in BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:17:58
What's your private keys I'll take care of it for you
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:11:01
Agree'd.. SELL SELL SELL. I will buy!
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:19:40
Amazing! This shows how well the bitcoin community is!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:08:31
Thanks! What date can I move them and receive it?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:42:38
Done, I think they delete bad reviews because I can't find any no 2x things 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:55:29
How do you know it is done going up if you buy when its going up? I know if I saw it going up to $800 back in the day I would have waited for a re-correction which back then would flatten it out too 500 or so then I buy back but now days charts are much harder too read imo.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:13:40
Money laundering 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:04:08
Agreed. Most alts are all pump/dump schemes.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:19:07
Amazing job!
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:26:55
.016? Shiiittt you need too work up. But it is a good start! Try getting free bitcoin with primedice but never gamble your OWN bitcoin, just use their faucet.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:40:32
Or just dip out to South America and cash out there convert too US dollars and come back.
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:52:54
I am a kiddo/early investor, I started trading around 22-23 and I am 26 almost 27(didn't hodle and I had traded over 180+ btc between 2013-2015 :( but I made out good). But I still am holding some bitcoin now and have plenty of fiat now. If you want too make money anything is possible.
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:57:30
I agree, I was young when I started I traded with emotion and lost all the bitcoin I started with even though I came out with more fiat (but still if I still had my btc I'd be a millionaire or damn close).. But now I get some bitcoin, hold it for a few weeks and then wait till I get more then sell off tiny bits then buy more when correction. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:41:03
Well part of the $1400 transaction included a few that were unconfirmed (around $400). I pushed TX's on all of them. Am I fucked or will it move.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:41:55
no it was put into perspective too me. I sold a long time ago stupidly. I have over 180btc and sold it all when it was expensive too me($700-900) thinking it was gonna crash.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:54:37
Buyer wants 5k.. Is that below?
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:02:54
Be careful selling locally. A lot of people have been arrested for not having MSB's.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:40:47
I'm holding my .989 of a BTC and 16k in fiat that I've made in the past week from trading dips
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:34:02
But its similar to the same theory of the flower bulbs...
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:42:45
I agree. I met one guy who has bots scraping the latest news on alts and such and used too buy at 10% + margin in btc too put into alts and he was consistent.
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:18:23
II disagree completely. I used to play paintball when I was 13 and its expensive. My mother at that age told me, if I wanna support myself I need a job. I found one washing dishes at age 13 and was paid 7.25/hr and stayed there for 1 1/2 years.

Buyer wants 5k.. Is that below?
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:46:49
if I would've hodle since I first started I'd be a millionaire by now but I was too busy margin trading :(.. But I do still have some bitcoin but I buy on markets when I see the ripe opportunity and sell so I can always have at least 10-20k cash on hand incase I wanna buy a new car or something.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:03:00
Just add bitcoin to accepted payment form for high end used cars. I wanted too see if its possible for a small fee per transaction like a referral fee or I would have to charge a one time fee for setting it up for them using my knowledge since they do not know how?
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:22:17
I moved them and see I can changed to BT1/BT2 but it's not even on the market trading.. if I converted my BTC to BT1/2 what exactly would I be accomplishing doing that?
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:17:35
I assume it's best to pick some alts up when fork is happening but which alts is what I'm curious about.
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:08:37
Hahaha fools
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:05:41
I lost .3 playing primedice.. never again.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:01:35
I was gonna sell market value x 5%
