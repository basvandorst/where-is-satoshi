I can't stand Coinbase for one reason only: their support SUCKS.  I've had nothing but trouble with their buggy system from the start.
It says I have a negative balance when I don't.  I've had a ticket in the system for a month and so far no resolution.
I set up recurring transactions that fail all the time without explanation.  I have tickets in the system for that all they ever tell me is to try again.  But I always end up with the same failure.
I haven't purchased anything for at least a week, and it says my deposit limit via bank account is $200.  I initiate a purchase for $200 and check the box for it to recur daily.  I get am email (again) saying: "There was a problem when trying to process your recurring payment: Buy $200.00 USD to BTC Wallet. You can resume the recurring payment once the issue is resolved." and no further explanation.  I go back into my account to delete the recurring transaction (and there's nothing in my history to show I ever attempted to purchase $200 worth of BTC) but now it says my daily deposit limit is only $10.   WTF?   Their system is BROKEN and their support is virtually NONEXISTENT.  I'm giving up, and looking for an alternative.  I will store my BTC elsewhere; I just want somewhere that will let me purchased without too much hassle, and....it'll actually work!

So......where can I purchase BTC (depositing from US bank acct) where the markup isn't astronomical???????  Searching around, some sites are begging for my money but they want $650-$700 per BTC (while I could get it from coinbase for $579 -- if their system wasn't broken).

I cannot.
