I had a dream BTC went down to $2. 2 FUCKING BUCKS. And I was ready to buy boat load of it. BUT FUCKING COINBASE WAS DOWN! 
Now that's a nightmare!

exchanges are nothing but a website these days. Trust the tech, it will find a way. They have been trying to ban piracy since more than a decade. how is that working out?

BCH at 9500 on Coinabase. $3500 at Bittrex. Buy it on Bittrex and dump it on coinabase tomorrow. Easy Money!

Check orders in GDAX. If it's not filled then you won't see the balance

they said same shit when china was supposed to ban bitcoins. people will fucking move on in a week 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:12
It won't show up automatically on coinable I think. Follow this guide. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:39
Then I guess wait since coinable has been down this evening. give em some time to figure it out
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:28:29
yeah takes about a week to show up and even slower now with holidays. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:45
yeah it will most probably go up since Gdaxx/coinbase picked it up. More exposer to the shitcoin. I'd buy if I had cash in GDAX

Dopey Roger Ver wants to play big with nasty BCH fork. Not under my watch! He is a total loser and doesnt know how to win. Make BTC Great Again!

which Alts you hold?
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:10:58
I had a same feeling when i bought $200 worth of BTC at $3300

\&gt; open GDAX
\&gt; Ctrl+F
\&gt; "Depth"

you can't ban anything on internet, period. Technology and people will always find a way, especially when so much money is on line. Enjoy the temporary FUD and price dip. buy all you can and wait for the problem to be solved.

Dollar cost average. If you have 1000 to spend on Bitcoin, dont spend all 1000 at the same time. Buy little bit at a time and spread out your purchase over 2-4 weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:06
Oh that explains it. I still think BCH will pump due to GDAX and coinable exposure now. Still worth bet.

!RemindMe 5 years. How much is bitcoin worth?
