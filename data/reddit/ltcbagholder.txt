May sound like something else entirely to some people.

It must show you something other than it does to me. Not joking.
Filter: Radeon - Video Cards - $200 - $600. XFX7870 - EUR 292.64 = 399 USD. HD7870 Visiontek - 407 EUR = 553 USD. There are no r9 cards at all. Maybe it's great in other locations, in Northern Europe... just not a thing.
EDIT: Had to add this gem: NEW arrival! Visiontek HD7750 EUR 275.47!

Does the store seem ridiculously expensive to anyone else?

My perspective is the EU/US volume. It truly is a Chinese lottery ticket. If Huobi volume is real, proportionally, nobody but the Chinese even have Bitcoin anymore.     
Look at this for a current hour trading volume, Bitstamp - 3.2, Finex - 0.4, BTCE - 3.7, Huobi - 21000     
So, what if they start jailing the Chinese bitcoiners or shut down Huobi? $150?     
We may get to the moon or new ATH, but not in a way we would want to.

AFAIK - directly from an exchange: No.

Relatively to many here I am clueless about personal computer security, but here are my suggestions for anyone reading this:
1) Install Firefox with the addons: Ghostery, Adblock, disable cookies, possibly javascript. Prior to visiting any exchange / even this place that has links everywhere, log out your gmails/facebooks etc and close the window.
2) You do not click a link that is not on an extremely ubiquitous site, ever. If let's say on the trollbox an extremely interesting looking link comes up, you google it and then arrive on the page.
3) You do not download an executable on the same computer, on the same operating system that you have a wallet on, ever.
4) Wallets are to be installed on computers that have freshly been equipped with an operating system from an untouched optical medium. If this is not possible, free Oracle virtual box software is to be used for a virtual machine installed in the mentioned manner.
5) Within such an operating system, unencrypted wallet.dats are to be encrypted or .rar encrypted+archived, then backed up MANY TIMES on disposable USB/DVD/CDR.
6) One account, one password. Seventeen accounts, seventeen passwords. You can write those down in pen, possibly in hints, not actual passwords.
This way: you rate not to get your computer infected, even if you do, there is a sandbox-like environment for your wallets, as there is no reason to type in a private key, keyloggers do not work. Your wallets do not get lost and it is more difficult to follow your activities online.

I think you have to fight this regardless. Where does it end? Blacklisting fails, diversely worded porn sites appear, they implement a white list? Extremely lucrative for the telecoms.

Trollbox says you should spend at least 5% of your bitcoins to keep the economy going. "The 5% rule".
