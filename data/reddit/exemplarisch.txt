The difference being that your website system requires a lot of trust ("family"), whereas LN is almost as trustless as the blockchain itself that's backing it

Ah, I misunderstood what you meant by locking.
The timelock feature is there to prevent getting away with dishonesty, and because of it there should never be incentive to be dishonest, as in that dispute the party that's honest always wins.

Does your money have no value because you're 'locking it' in your bank account? The locking it is just locking in the on-chain security. You can still pay for any connected service at will, so your money is not locked in that sense.
Interesting point about monetizing data/privacy you're bringing up there, hadn't thought about that, gonna look into it.

144 confirmations (/blocks), so approximately 24 hours.

When someone asks you how many bitcoins you have in your wallet, do you say zero, because they're on the blockchain? Same goes for this guy's hard drive, he has his keys on there somewhere (could be in a wallet), password protected or in a corrupted file possibly. Potentially retrievable, but costly.

Is there an easy tool for extracting the key from a wallet.dat file (I have my pre-fork BTC on [Bitcoin Wallet]( I'm not that tech-savy.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:50:42
Any private keys that belong to your Bitcoin from before the fork give access to both your BTC and BCH, and you need those before-fork-keys to claim your BCH on the other side.
To only risk giving your BCH to a still relatively unknown party it's best to first move your BTC to somewhere further along the chain after the fork, by sending them to another BTC-address.
Now the older private keys only give access to your BCH, which you haven't yet moved (they will have stayed behind at your old address). 
Correct me if I'm wrong!

No, the chain split has already happened. Only bitcoin held before the fork received their equal in BCH. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:52:35
That's for BCH I guess?
Generating a BTC deposit address should work fine (or you probably already have one).
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:41:51
Probably the smart way to go! Just HODL both coins until we know how to reliably gain access to our BCH.
I'm still figuring things out myself.

If by splitting you mean sending your BTC to another wallet before splitting: not taking that precaution does not delete your Bitcoin, it just provides the middle man (BCH wallet) with access to your BTC as well, which is unnecessarily risky.
I guess you could say they are then likely to sell these 'stolen' Bitcoins, even putting downward pressure on the BTC price ;)

Sure, but I was replying to someone asking:

You can sell your BTC on Bittrex for BCH already.

It sorts ~~alphabetically~~ numerically/chronologically nicely
