I'm guessing Coindesk.

We are i4SEE, a think tank for EDGE Innovations for General Dynamics. We are aware and have been following some of the horror stories in Bitcoin security.
Our initial research and motivation came about to solve security issues in the "bring your own device" jungle. Particularly prominent in the banking/legal/ and other industry with sensitive data.  
Although are work was not initially directed towards Bitcoin. We think that what we have already can be shifted toward Bitcoin hardware, including a hardware wallet.

We have no issue showing our code now or moving forward. We have not yet determined the open source license we will use however.

Now we're talking! We expect the pricing to be compatible to portable hard drives. As broad as that may sound that's the best comparison we can provide right now.

We have a patent filed to secure mobile devices before Apple. Currently, we are the only ones using this chip in our particular industry but there are definitely some unknowns regarding the future of the Authentec chip. What we think is important, however, is that we are able to take the best tech in the market and incorporate it. Maybe it will be Authentec or maybe a better one. We can be flexible.

Just tried it out. Simple as hell. This could be what's needed for mass adoption of BTC. Easiest wallet to setup, easiest way to make payments. Wish Paypal was this easy.
