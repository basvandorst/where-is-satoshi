Stupid example, she was breaking the law. Plain and simple. Don't play the game if you can't handle the score.

Definitely, not sure what OP was thinking here lol.

If it has risen since the ATH in Dec. '17, wouldn't that not be the ATH then?

Probably no one in the public eye. I have a feeling he is alive, he had to disappear because he realized the shit storm he started with governments, big banks, and the elite class. There are people out there who would want to harm him. I would even wager he posts on Reddit as an anon from time to time.

Don't make light of such a sad quote...

That's how you get lots of copycats...

Just buy it and "forget" about it. That's what I did in 2013. Just because there are meteoric highs and lows doesn't mean this isn't a long-term investment like any other.

Your portfolio? You mean Bitcoin wallet?

Doesn't mean it's not flawed.

So the EUs are just going to bully UK into paying money?
Also, Schengen =! EU

Well, it depends on the journalist. They just all fall under an umbrella of the organization. I wouldn't want a publication being a hivemind of group-think. Differing opinions is a *good* thing.

Well, they obviously don't value your business.

His entire fortune and career is based off of dumbing things down for people who can't do things for themselves. This quote is par for the Wozniak course. Hopefully people listen to him and not that LSD-smoking Jobs guy. He's been quiet for a while though, think he sold his stock and ran for the hills iirc.

Well that's wrong, Bitcoin has value as it is proof of work. Dolalrs do not.

I normally buy at 16k or 18k, and refine to 24k. Takes time but worth the profit.
