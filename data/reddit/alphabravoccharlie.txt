So Monero?

I'm inclined to agree with you. Im surprised how many downvotes I got just mentioning it. I think to have truly fungible money, it needs to be anonymous. Chain analytics are only getting better and coin mixing leaves a lot to be desired in terms of privacy.

Robinhood disrupted the retail investor market by offering 0 fees. Now TD Ameritrade and Schwab have had to follow suit. We need a player like that to enter the crypto space.

Instead of saying 277 million kilo Satoshi, why not 277 MS  (mega satoahi) or .277 GS  (giga satoshi). Using full metric would help public adoption and increase clarity.
Edit: full not fill

It seems like people are 'printing crypto' with all of the the block chains. We need to come to a consensus on a standardized chain or there will be thousands of blockchains people use.

Hedging your bets, so they look good either way.

Will do!

You were right! Good call.

At that point the network would fork and and people would use the chain they China is not using.

I'd imagine it would be risky going there. High crime and crazy levels of poverty. I'm sure the risk is paying off for him now!

Fly to Zimbabwe, bring back 'tones' of money, profit?
