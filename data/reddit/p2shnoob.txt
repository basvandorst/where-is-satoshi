With them I have the option to keep all the private keys to myself… but I guess I wasn't really doing that. So I will only let them have one HSM+Passphrase and the other offline. Do you use HSM? How do you handle private keys?

I will study your guide this weekend, looks incredibly detailed.

I didn't think it was that good. Since you are here, I want to confirm if there is no limit on Multi-signature accounts, the pricing page is a little confusing.

Thanks I included your suggestion on the list as

So your answer is "trust us (bitgo) instead"???
To fix a worry about collusion between my wife and my son (which is the least of my issues), you're saying trust Bitgo and all it's employees, sub-contractors, and service providers? Riiiiiight.

It's a fair point, but she is not an idiot. She is as exposed to social engineer as I am that's why I'm giving her close to the same amount of "power" as I have. She also has access to the safe deposit boxes where the other 2 backup keys are.

Would be nice if that was more apparent.

Considering it, but he only has 1 key too, he can't send money out. 
Am I missing something?

She only has one key, she can't do a transaction herself.

You have  a point, the issue I have is then it will need to be more complicated, I'd need to give my wife one more key. I need her to be able to easily take the money out. 
(3-of-9) 
- 3 cold storage
- 2 wife
- 3 me
- 1 son
or maybe
- 1 lawyer
- 1 wife
This feels way more complicated, and legally she owns half of what I have any ways.

Consciousness upload to the blockchain will happen some day.

That's a very valid point, there is a certain level of trust required when letting others have enough quorum to take actions without you. However, my wife already has access to all I own and my son would keep her in check in vice versa. So I hope.
