Then maybe you could be the one to start the next random tip thread. Clearly it can be done, and impressed upon people with even a few mBTC. It looks like he managed to stir excitement with less than .3 btc

$150 x 4 = $600. (Jally price in sept) 
$100 x 4 = $400. (2GH/s upgrade cost for each jally)
My order had $13 added in addition to the cost of the unit for fees or shipping, not sure. So i'm gonna guess this guy paid ~$1050
Edit: Added the cost for the 2GHs upgrade on all four units.

The above comment resulted in me creating a BitcoinTip address, funding it, and will be reimbursing your minor investment of .1 BTC as soon as it confirms.
You've exposed BTC to more potential candidates using that thread in the course of a day, than I've exposed since I got in to BTC a couple years back.
R/Trees, as funny as it is, are more likely to do their research on BTC than most other subreddits after having been introduced so abruptly. I think SilkRoad also boosts potential interests for these folks, and it may be worth mentioning if you do this in a subreddit like R/Trees or R/Drugs. 
The conversation and interest I could see was piqued from that thread, is truly incredible :)

When there is heavy lag, this is normal. If you're absolutely paranoid about the transaction processing, withdraw your BTC to your wallet.

What state or area will this event be hosted?

Their previous product line, bfl fpga's. This gallery consists of no ASICs.

OP and I ordered within a day or two of eachother.. 
Since then, BFL said anyone getting a Jalapeno would end up getting a 4.5GH/s unit instead, and then they offered the $100 2GHs increase not too long ago. It's a good sign if he has received ~7-8GHs units.
It's definitely the same thing. He has four jalapenos(4.5gh/s miners) in the picture you see above.
