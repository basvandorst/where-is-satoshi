DACA (A program to let illegals stay in the US) was put in place by Obama. There wasn't any official bill  no dialogue with congress, it was simply created by a memo from the dep. of Homeland Security. After he was elected Trump could have ended this at any time if he wanted to, but instead chose to allow Democrats to negotiate. Now they're taking the opportunity that Trump gave them to hold the government hostage with their bullshit. To pass a budget you need a simple majority, but to actually vote on it the debate period needs to be over. We could pass a budget tonight but democrats are filibustering and in order to end it you need 60 votes, which the 51 Republicans aren't able to get on their own.
So they're saying that unless we let illegals do what ever they want in our country nobody gets their paychecks.

Just remember, don't actually buy on coinbase. Deposit money and then but on GDAX so you don't have to pay fees, the two sites are owned by the same company.

Regardless of the coin debate it's literally impossible to scale without increasing blocksize though. Even with lightning you'd still need to open/close channels on the main chain

So would they still be able to track you if you move it between multiple wallets? How do they know which wallet belongs to whoever?

One node pausing doesn't warrant an apology, dude. I doubt anybody would have even noticed
