You feel that?  The way the shit clings to the air? It's gonna be a goxstorm!

There is actually strong evidence that neolithic peoples lived as long as many modern people do.  It is with the introduction of agriculture that people became sick and short-lived.... damn... sorry... I ruined a good joke

I don't know man. I have only been into bitcoin for several weeks now, but was definitely warned away from Gox.  It seems that people have been wary of them for awhile, but, like I said... I'm a bit new to all of this.

My friend is one of the devs for [arousr]( they have been accepting bitcoin for a couple of weeks but so far not many takers. They have sms and video. They are still adding services too.

"Technology is for porn" could be the slogan for the last century or more really... Possibly the "Venus"statues from the Neolithic

I believe the California law just included digital currencies in what is termed "lawful money" which is not the same thing as "legal tender."
That being said, just because a state doesn't have the right to pass a law doesn't mean that they won't.  I live in Missouri, which recently passed a law making it illegal for a federal agent to enforce national gun regulations.  Nevermind that that law itself is illegal and that it is entirely unenforceable... they passed it anyways.:^)

almost perfect except the whole point of a con is to build the confidence of your would-be victim... you don't build confidence by having disaster after disaster unfold.... if this was a long con, then it would seem that he was even more incompetent at the con as he was anything else...

This would be my initial instinct... but mighty tempting for someone of meager means and small holdings.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:22:09
I saw it too.  It did say "insolvency" originally... you can still see it worded that way in the twitter feed for coinbase and circle

You are right, I'm sorry.  I also messed up my time periods.  The idea, however, that life wsa "nasty, brutish, and short" (a Stephen Pinker quote) is debated amongst various experts.  I don't mean to be argumentative or combative if I come accross that way.  As autowikibot points out below, there is a difference between life span and life expectancy which is well put out in [this blog](  Not only are those numbers derived from an average, thus the more infant mortality the shorter the average (which is why antebellum life expectancy was so low), but the methods used to age ancient skeletons up until recently have been unable to accuractely judge the age of a particular skeleton past the age of 35.
Dr. Chris Ryan and Dr. Cassilda Jetha argue this point very effectively I believe in their book "Sex at Dawn" and it seems that they will explore these ideas more in their upcoming publication "Civilized to Death."
The adoption of agriculture brought concentrated populations of humans into contact with concentrated populations of animals, which led to the emergence of many of our infectious diesease.  There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the adoption of agriculture led to a far inferior diet when compared to hunter/gatherer societies resulting in shorter stature and, when combined with infectious diseases, led to sickness and premature death.
I am sorry to beat this one to death, but this topic fascinates me.  Again, I hope I don't come accross as too much of a douche.
