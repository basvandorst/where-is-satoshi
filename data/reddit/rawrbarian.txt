When I look at that I see a pretty stable floor after the massive growth over the past year. Could it collapse? Sure. But maybe it won't. (again).

Loving this little run. So glad I bought the January sale! Something inside me is cheering so hard for eth to surpass bcash for good! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:38
it's showing on my mobile app but not on gdax. -5.5k on the hour

Somebody take this man's keyboard away! =p
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:20:12
How'd the panic selling party go? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:43:14
With the way it's leveled out recently I'd say so. Not saying it won't dip again but this seems like a good baseline after the whole bcash fiasco
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:40
I'm curious as to what it will even out at.. huge sell wall at nearly 4k... I'm afraid this will cause alot of people to lose alot of money lol. Stickin out of the bch..

I bought another chunk at 19.2, wasn't too thrilled to have it drop to 18.2 soon after but it's on the way back up now so I'm smilin!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:10
the ol "crash n burn"
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:33
17k to 19k to 15k to 17k in the blink of an eye =p

Yes those are their convenience fees, basically. As I understand it, the fees on GDAX are quite a bit less. However they are the same company, Coinbase is just much more user friendly.

lmao @ that 10k coin sell wall.. HF DIPPING BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:06:41
Heres to hoping! I'm just hoping we hurdle this 18800 stall asap
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:06:56
Bcash? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:08:24
Bought the dip! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:30:28
I'd tell you to hodl, but what do I know. �� 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:17
Seems like youve already made a good buy :p
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:15:21
Seems like there are some big fishes out there. Someone posted a sale of 7300 bc at 111k earlier =p
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:55
so hard..
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:02:57
Alot of people primarily reddit on mobile though, where there is no side bar. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:08:08
..and its gone.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:53:13
It's great because it's literally gone up 35 percent in a day.. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:16:59
Got another couple hundred in at 10.7 or so! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:38:47
Well, right.. If people see value in buying the dip, whether it's 1k or 10k it will correct itself the other way. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:57:32
Eh I've been expecting it to stabilize with how quickly it's been bouncing around the last week. 8 honestly was expecting it to settle around 13 but I'll take it where its at =p
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:30:05
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:30
That's my thought as well. How about a healthy mass buy to correct the drop lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:44
This whip lash is fun.. Atleast it's showing signs of whipping in both directions ☺ 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:18
yeah and its steadily increasing.. nothing like exposure to literally make the people who have been hodling BCH to mass dump....
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:19
literally 10k coins rdy to be sold at 8.5k..
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:16:07
Even better ☺

Sorry to hear man, I'd donate but my net worth has dropped 30% lately.. We should cuddle or something. Lol?
