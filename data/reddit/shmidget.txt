So my mom is a dumb fuck? We are talking about mass adoption and if you don’t understand that giving people respect and that it’s a not an issue of people being dumb then you my friend are the dumb fuck!

This. 
So many people have no clue who TBL is. I once consulted with a very well known tech company in San Francisco: the whole floor, I asked...nobody knows, nobody cares! It’s crazy. I printed a picture of him out and taped it to the walls in disgust. 
I remember the 20 year anniversary of the web.  Not one blogger wrote a damn thing and this can be verified easily using Google.
What gives? What are these schools teaching? Are we just going keep on keepin on without a care of who’s shoulders we stand on?

No I just think dumbass comments, like the one you are making above, waters down this subreddit...it’s not constructive and isn’t producing shit.
Honestly the BTC core team is a shit show and why they can’t figure out lightning much less mass adoption and it’s because of people like...YOU! :)

By the way the HTML moment is definitely when people have an app in their hands that works easier than PayPal or Venmo. I shouldn’t need your btc address or even qr code. Honestly both of those are private to me and I prefer not to share. I don’t need that for Venmo? I just share my unique username. 
A lot of people get scared simply by seeing a string of characters!
