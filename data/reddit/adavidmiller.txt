That's technically true of many things. The reality is that some will, many won't, maybe never or not until much later.
Having competent, well spoken people is beneficial in any space, any system needs those who will proselytize on its behalf.

If you want a shorter answer, the idea is that coinbase knows who you are, so if you transfer from there to another address, they can guess that that address is yours, and since bitcoin transactions are public, that data can be traced around potentially identifying a lot of your transaction history depending on how you use things.
So the point is that if you're paranoid about your privacy, you don't leave such an obvious connection with something such as Coinbase that knows who you are.

He means there's literally a site call shapeshift that will let you anonymous trade in one crypto for another. Since it's anonymous whatever you end up with won't be connected to your identity. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:50:47
Yes, what he meant was that he thought he was talking to the same person he was before, which was incorrect. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:07:16
And if we do so and usage increases to the point where it's in the same trouble as it now in a few months, still without lightning, then what? Increase it again? Every increase will see further adoption using space wasting transactions that will be difficult to free up again.
My view is that maybe making bitcoin unusable for the near future may be what it needs to survive in the future, it should not see further adoption until it can stretch the space it uses further.
On the other hand, an immediate size increase is a lazy patch to buy time, but I really don't think the consequences of slight increases would matter in the long term so I don't really disagree with just biting the bullet and doing it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:45:22
Why would that be a limit? Why could a Satoshi not equal 5 cents? 
I think the idea behind that number is some hypothetical on the maximum economic value Bitcoin could come to represent, but I'm not sure you can measure that in USD as it is now and expect that same measurement to be relevant then. 
Or in other words, that would be an incredibly high value and it's hard to say what would happen to other currencies were Bitcoin to get there. I don't think it makes sense to assume USD would represent the same value as it does now. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:23:14
There's certainly irony in the fact that the safest place to store your access to your money that is an alternative to dealing with banks is also a bank, but the problem with banks is banking, not their facilitation of secure storage.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:46:48
I think they should absolutely do that, after mass adoption of segwit and lightning (and maybe other stuff, whatever's around).
Problem is that these other solutions still require block space. If you expand the block size before they're used, bitcoin will be "fixed" and adoption will spike using plain old less efficient transactions. Once adopted, it's much harder to migrate that usage off the old stuff and on to the new stuff, so you're kind of stuck with a bunch of inefficient space.
On the other hand, let bitcoin suffer with it's issues until these solutions exist and only increase the block size as demand from those needs increases, and the overall space used is much more efficient.

That doesn't change what he said, the 250k insurance is specific to your USD holdings, not your crypto as the video states. 
What actually happens if coinbase were compromised and the crypto insurance needs to come into play, no idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:43:04
Because actual currencies don't have exchange rates? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:37:24
Well there's the difference. By this point I'd imagine most of those wanting to consolidate in BTC to gain BCH had previously done so, particularly with certain exchanges implementing extended waiting periods. 
So to me, "going into the fork" is more the week or two prior to the final 24-48 hours.
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:44:15
Why? It's 1:1. If a user had 2 BTC, simply say they have 2 BCC.
If the numbers you show your users aren't backed up by actual assets anyways, you can show them whatever you want. Makes no difference until they try to cash out. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:07:55
What is the source of your number? 83T is in the ballpark of numbers usually cited for that.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:04:06
To your first point,  that's what the first person in this reply is addressing. You're not losing out on an appreciating if you buy more to replace what you spend. 
The assumption of course is that you don't already have all your spending money in bitcoin, and the downside is, as mentioned, inconvenience, and the fact that fees involved involved in buying bitcoin mean you're actually paying more. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:38:16
Assuming your dollar value doesn't crash and everyone needs bitcoin to buy anything, of course.

@_date: 2017-08-01 06:55:07
Audited by who, exactly? Their cash holdings are one thing, but I'm fairly sure claims of crypto currency holdings are still rather unregulated. 
I'm not quite sure what you're even talking about. The initial question was why (or why not) an insolvent exchange would support BCC as means of covering up their insolvency.
If an exchange is audited, then this discussion is irrelevant as their insolvency would be known. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:21:08
lol. Well, they certainly could, but that depends on exactly how insolvent they are. They need to actually have the BTC in order to steal the BCH. If they don't, they have nothing to sell and it'll still look like stealing :P

@_date: 2017-08-14 17:29:25
Why? If you want to see bitcoin valued then surely it helps to actually use it?
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:18:57
Yes, all that is true, but seems unrelated to the question at hand, which is that regardless of their holdings, if they don't have enough to cover a mass simultaneous withdraw, would it be in their interest to credit their users with BCC, potentially multiplying their shortage, but discouraging the withdraw.
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:35:31


As I side note, I don't think that first part is possible either. Fairly sure QR codes are either correct or invalid, for pretty much the same reasons as the bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:47:43
Well, no. You're thinking in terms of if they don't have the private keys for one, then they don't have the private keys for the other. That'd be correct, but the whole idea is that an insolvent exchange doesn't have the keys to begin with, the balances shown to users would just be for show and not backed by actual coins controlled by the exchange.
BCC would be no different. They don't have to actually have the coins to tell their users they do. It's certainly risky and is basically just digging a deeper hole for themselves, but they might not have many alternatives if people want to withdraw what they don't have.

@_date: 2017-08-17 14:45:40
Well yes, that's what I was saying. If you cashed out and bitcoin really did take over, you'd have no choice but to buy back in at at lesser amount, hopefully before your fortune becomes completely worthless. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:39:47
Like I said, you're fine assuming that's correct. There's many cryptos and there will be many more, exactly how things will play out with the global economy in the long term is certainly not something I'm qualified to argue on. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:52:13
That's fair, but how does that make it better than anything else? 
Long term, what would be the point of that? If Bitcoin were primarily a store of value and you still need alternative currencies to actually buy things, why would that survive against something that fulfills both those roles? 
Edit: We're also getting off on a bit of tangent here as you skipped my initial question. Even Accepting that Bitcoin doesn't need to be used for everyday transactions to be valuable, why is it a downside if it can be? This started with your criticizing someone for spending it, why shouldn't they? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:59:28
Even if they wanted to do that, how could they? They can prove you had coins when you're with an exchange, but after you've sent them elsewhere? Unless they find your wallet software/private keys, those coins could be anyways. Maybe you gave them away, maybe you lost them, sent them to the wrong address by accident, etc... 
It's completely irrelevant until you try to convert the coins to fiat, or use the bitcoin directly for purchases.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:38:47
Sorry, I thought "valued more" was implied, apparently not. 
If the hypothetical goal is to replace currency, or to act as a value store backing alternatives, then it's got a long ways to go. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:08:39
Because it's worth pocket change compared to the global economy? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:30:17
Maybe it wouldn't, but bitcoin (or a different crypto, whatever) is a currency, and pending a bunch of upgrades, public awareness and usability, then you hypothetically end up with a globally accepted currency that everyone likes and uses.
Given such a situation, say people start getting paid in bitcoin, people start being able to (and wanting to) pay all their expenses with bitcoin, what happens to others? Currencies suffer from supply and demand like anything else, if we reach a tipping point where people don't actually need or want fiat, then their value goes to shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:14:05
Of course. Even without considering lost coins, populations and economies will continue to grow while the total bitcoin is finite. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:31:25
It won't. What he's saying is that if you have bitcoin and it forks into multiple currencies, you holdings will be mirrored on those. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:49:21
Hence "pretty much the same" rather than "literally identical".
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:04:40
I don't believe I said they won't adapt. If anything, everything I said supports the notion that they will have to adapt. What form that adaptation will take, no idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:16:20
While the backing of the US government does matter, it's real relevance is simply that it's an authority that gets everyone on the same page. 
It's less about any backing of real world assets and more about people needing to feel secure that the money they get earn is money they can spend, and that money they have today will still be worth something tomorrow. 
If you've got a common authority setting a standard (ie: most people must be paid in USD and most places must accept USD and most people must pay their taxes in USD), then you have those things. So, the US Government establishes scale, and scale provides relative stability and stability builds trust, so you have a valued currency. If a crypto had that same scale, it would have the same stability and same trust, or more so. 
In other words, the government's influence is relevant because it writes the rules that ensure scale. That's all well and good, but what happens when those rules become obsolete? 
Ensuring USD as an option only goes so far if people start *choosing* to use something else. If both the company and employee, the business and the customer, opts to use bitcoin (or an alternative, or assuming future scaling solutions, whatever) because they prefer it, what's the advantage of the government backed currency?
tldr; Scale and common usage / acceptance is the relevant factor. Government is a shortcut to that, but it can also be earned. If something else can convince people to *choose to* use it rather than *force them* to, it can stand just as tall. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:03:01
Regarding the US, true enough, but again, that's a result of scale which you've pointed out. The US is biggest, so if you want to deal with the US you deal in USD. If you want to deal with eachother, you might still deal in USD, again, because it's biggest and it's something that can be of use to everyone. 
If something else grows to a similar ubiquity, a lot of that becomes moot. Of course, if the US flat out refuses to deal in anything other than USD no matter what then you're right, a lot of big money won't have much a choice and it'll keep going strong, but I don't think it's a safe assumption that they wouldn't want to be in on the action eventually.
Why exactly do you think bitcoin would not be predictable at a hypothetical point in the future where everyone was using it? 
Bitcoin is volatile now, but it is also trivially small (relatively) and a handful of billions of USD in either direction is a significant impact. Would that not become less true as it grows? 
Granted, I won't pretend that that's a simple topic or that I have any expectations on how long things will take. Even when it can efficiently be used as a currency, people won't stop treating it like a stock so long as there's growth, making it less predictable and less useful as a currency and then we're basically where we are now, but bigger.
But eventually, as it grows to whatever limits of whichever markets it is capable of representing  (again, hypothetically under the premise that bitcoin specifically works out in every way idealized), growth slows, value becomes predictable, use as a currency for anyone becomes practical, trust increases, etc... 
There's certainly barriers along the way and who knows what sort of shitshow will be involved. It may very well never get there, but I do not agree that in theory, it simply *can't* or that we wouldn't want it to.
Edit: And after browsing some of the other replies to you I feel I should comment on the "hardcore libertarian psycho anarchist" point. I'm not that, I just like the technology and look forward to having it be a globally useful thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:05:58

This is the correct answer. Anyone who says they can't gain weight this either eats pretty reasonably, or is far more active on a daily basis then someone aspiring to obesity should be, probably both.
Eat more, do less. Your body isn't magic, if you fill it with junk and don't do shit, the fat will come. 
Now, trying to gain weight in muscle mass or whatever it is people do is another story, but getting fat is pretty straightforward.

Downside of that is reading it again if you don't actually know braille, sounds kind of annoying.

@_date: 2017-07-13 20:25:21
Agreed. In fact, I don't think bitcoin will ever truly take off until it is adopted by banks. Personal liability and responsibility for every $ is something many people do not want, it's the reason I don't store all my savings in cash under my bed.
Ultimately, I don't even think it will be as shallow as having a bank manage the security and liability of a 'wallet' for you, but rather those banks, or governments, will own the bitcoin (or something else) and use it to back their own currencies. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:12:54

@_date: 2017-07-04 00:49:58
Depends on how they got it and what they do with it. Potentially quite easy, perhaps impossible. 
Edit: That said, the requirements for using it and securing anonymity are enough that most people wouldn't want or use it, leaving it worthless enough that the rest is a moot point. 
Maybe it could find a niche like those coins used by the criminal society  in John Wick.
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:26:51
Not uncommon for anyone who spent more than 10 minutes with bitcoin prior to 2011 or so. Could barely give the stuff away so there's probably little forgotten patches of it all over the place.
The real trick is actually still having the private keys for such long lost bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:05:44
Well, you could send your stolen btc to a billion addresses, claim those addresses belonged to your legit customers (even allow anonymous accounts if you want), then have those fake addresses trade with each other and harvest them into nothing through transaction fees. Stolen bitcoin is now legit bitcoin earned by your exchange and you can do what you want with it. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:23:13
For that to be true, not only will bitcoin have to represent the value of the entire economy, but the world's economy will need to be several times larger than it is now. 
I wouldn't hold your breath on that one. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:58:54
He said it's strongly down relative to BTC, and it is.
That said it depends on the timeframe. It's about the same as it was in late May, but it's dropped 50% from where it peaked in mid June. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:39:27
Well, yeah. There's valuable now and valuable later. Increase the supply enough and prices go down so that maybe it's not worth going to space for it anymore. Except by then maybe you've got more infrastructure in place, so it's cheaper to do, so you keep doing it.
Long term, either demand for gold explodes and justifies continued operation, or the space mining operations would slow to whatever the price point justified.
