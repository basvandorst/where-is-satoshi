It sounds to me like if the taxes were lower the poor people would have more money and not be in poverty. They don’t have all benefits but they have extra money to spend on the benefits that they need.

The US dollar use to be backed by gold but it’s not anymore in essence rendering it “based on thin air”

I wouldn’t put it past government to try it

You must not live in the US because that’s a flat out lie. You can look at any tax table to see that the more you make the more you pay in PERCENT. It’s a graduated tax schedule, check your facts please.

Low taxed. I believe I’m capable of making my own choices and not having the government making them for me.

I completely agree with everything you just said. Let me clarify by saying that I said LOW taxes not NO taxes. There is a place for government (obviously without it there would be anarchy). When the government taxes to the point of investing my money for retirement or choosing what healthcare it thinks I need or choosing to fund organizations and programs I disagree with, THATS where I have a problem.

Can you explain how low taxes means increased crime? I’m not sure how you drew that conclusion.

I’m very individualistic. People may hate me for saying this, but I’m not concerned about other people’s poor choices. Life isn’t fair and that’s just a fact. I shouldn’t be forced to help make it “fairer”. Now what I can do (and I do) is help out people I know who are struggling. We don’t have universal healthcare so I have the ability to make the choice and help out a friend who got diagnosed with a crippling illness. But if a friend breaks a leg jumping off a roof, I’m not gonna help that guys bills. He made a dumb choice and now he’s paying for it. Government systems paid for by my taxes take that choice away from me.
