Thanks, yes I am, handling it ASAP. I have messaged the OP, explaining the situation, and will have the OP's post edited ASAP. 
Please make sure to use  because if anything comes through on the 1Lucas wallet, without the information in the website, It can not be used, and it will forever sit in an account the campaign can not use for funds. I am excited to see people being engaged, and wanting to have someone who will represent and fight for the CryptoCurrency community in Congress, and we will continue to support you, as you all have been so supportive of us! 
As always, feel free to PM me or email me at anytime with any questions you may have, myself, or the expert we have been working with will more than likely be able to answer them for you.

I believe we already established that was not the case, it was the account before we set up the website. If you would like confirmation that the 1Lucas is not fake, please feel free to email me, my email is listed a few times here, and it does explain actually everything involving the 1lucas wallet. 
Given, donating to the 1Lucas without us having the information that is on the form, we would be unable to use those funds, and would end up donating them to a charity, to rid them off the campaign ledger. 
the website  is the only accepted now, the 1Lucas was used in our community before our website launched to get things started.

I think i must explain, he can not give them money, to donate to us, for him. That would be illegal. Can he be sharing things on facebook encouraging his friends in the states, to support, volunteer and donate, because he wishes he could, or to something of that effect? absolutely.

Many Dem's in the area vote Dem, because they are social issue voters. With our amount of support for Civil Liberties, Ending corporate welfare, and anti-Spying. We have seen a massive uptrend in that area. While we continue to engage in the discussion of Fiscal issues, after hearing our reasoning, many are keen to agree. As well as many Dem endorsements on the local level, who believe we would be a better fit representing Pinellas County in DC. Also you can email me anytime with questions, and if you would like to help at campaignmanager 
No reason to PM it, it is public record.

Sadly no, but we are thankful for your support. 
Since you can not donate, feel free to share with any U.S. friends you may have, to encourage them to donate for you instead.

Third Party* not independent, he is actually the highest polled in history for the LP. With 25% Undecided, largely Independents and Dem's, we have a strong chance to pick them up.

That is your right, given it is early and you may decide that we will better represent some of your issues in the next term, than Jolly. Because it will be one of us, You have a choice in such a crucial upcoming term, someone that will support some of your issues, or actively vote 100% every time against you. That is another reason I think we are getting more support is that they can run against us again in 2016, if we win, and have a chance, rather than vs an incumbent with massive amounts of friends with a ton of corporate funds. 
For some dems, it is a choice of the Lesser of two evils, something Libertarians have had to chose between for many years. 
Also in Pinellas county, many Dems are Fiscally conservative, which we are, and are full supporters of our ideas on both Social and Fiscal issues.

Feel free to send me an email, and I will happily forward it to him.

Who says its an Ayn Rand book club? Ayn Rand would hate Lucas, lol... look him up before you place those two in the same category... 
Also with 25% un decided, that is looking pretty good.

Saintpetersblog commisioned the Poll, he was very much against us during the special election. 
I guess i should mention I am the campaign manager for his campaign lol. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 05:58:59
Absolutely not, during our special Election we would have been against it, and have been constantly working to find a way to not have to raise the debt ceiling in the first place, and the simplest way would have been to end corporate welfare. The Live debate on CSPAN from the Special Election is online, and he answers that question. 
I think that "liberty" republicans have tarnished a lot of how Libertarians actually think, and people do not realize that Libertarians have many different subgroups as does any Political Party. 
I implore you to actually research Lucas, and you may see he is quite different from what you have thought all Libertarians are.

I think you will see less people shift that way, Given we just had a special election in our District in March, the congressional race is fresh on their mind, especially after the Dem lost to Jolly, in a district R controlled for 44 years.

No one is asking you to donate Anon. Also, our donations page does not allow it. $100 was an FEC guideline, and not apart of protocol. The IRS says to treat it like a Donation in-Kind, which means it follows normal campaign restrictions for your area, $2600 per cycle(5200 if done during primary season) and 5200 for a couple(10,400 if done during Primary season) 
Hopefully that clears things up for you. Great question though.

Yes, Please do go through the donation Page, the 1Lucas address was the campaigns, before BitPay offered to set us up, and use us as a testrun for future campaign processing. We have been working with them to make sure we exceed all FEC future regulations, to make sure we have the most up to date Donation page for BTC. 
The 1Lucas Address is the campaigns, and all money that was recieved, we asked people before our Launch to email us a message with information on our Donation page if over $100, to follow normal USD protocol, under $100 you usually do not need any information. 
-I am the manager of the campaign, so I figured I would clear that up, and through the help of the BTC community of Tampa bay, we were able to have a great pre-launch and help us figure out the IRS and FEC guidelines, and because of that, BitPay has made this much easier for us.
I hope that clears any concerns you had.
