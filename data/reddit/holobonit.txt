Oh shit, that means they've figured out how to subvert it.

Banks made accounts obsolete years ago by charging so much and paying so little interest on savings that only fear of house fires and burglaries made them more attractive than your mattress.

Every time I read a news story about Paypal I am so glad I procastinated on getting a paypal account so long.

Let me be clear that I'm claiming no wisdom here, just fortuitous procrastination.

So Nigerian princes will have trouble moving money out of the country?  Maybe they can email people in other countries asking for help...

The article isn't clear on what the actual crime was.  Cash deposits less than 10k? In my case, that's every cash deposit I've ever made.  What is the exact pattern that triggers the vultures?

Ok, thank you.

One problem with your theory. Apple isn't just making a statement.  They are refusing to comply with a lawful court order.  There's no cheap way out of this. Concievably, it could cost Apple hundreds of millions in criminal corporate fines,  and in the imprisonment of executive officer(s) of the company.  
  
This shit is real, this time.  It isn't the bile-producing posturing of a PR flack.

I had that thought also, but this occurred to me:   
  
What would corp. lawyers think of this statement if their boss brought it to them  after getting a court order to do this exact thing?  Would they tell the boss, sure go ahead, no legal problems with *that*?  
  
I also noted there seems to be a bit of wiggle room here:  
  


We are challenging the FBI’s demands ...*  
  
Doesn't come right out and say "we won't comply".  They may be "opposing" it by appealing it as high as they can.  I'm not sure now exactly what action they *are* taking.

I'm getting them about every other day.  I block ever single user that sends it, so those userids are useless for spamming me for anything else in the future.  But still get more spam a day or two later.  
And OP, why would anyone ever think spam is cool?  That's like finding a bag of flaming dog shit on your doorstep and thinking it's cool.
   
  
  To whomever: I will never, ever do business with Etherum, and will as strongly as possible discourage others from doing so because of Etherum spam

The story has been developing for months.

Yes, I agree.  Apple will need massive support from the tech sector and the public at large to have any chance at prevailing at this.  Considering how many stories there have been in UK, US, EU recently about lawmakers and law enforcement agencies trying to illegalize encryption, somebody was going to have to take a stand sooner or later.  
  
The lawmakers are setting themselves against mathematically proven certainties as if they can be written away with a human law.  It's seemingly become their only way of solving problems, instead of consulting and listening to the very people they are attacking with lunacy like this.

You're talking about a bug, not something they are doing *at enormous economic risk* for the benefit of their customers, and in fact,  for *all of us*, because you know this is going to result in binding legal judgement,  one way or another.  If you persist in your comparison, you will demonstrate to the world that you are an ignorant troll.  
For your enlightenment: *Corporations just don't risk profits for customers*  unless something is very, very wrong with the world.  
And that's what's happening here.

Thank you, Apple.

I, for one, am grateful that our government doesn't have enough people working there who clever enough to plan in advance all the conspiracy theories that our government is accused of carrying out with so few flaws.  
That would be a truly terrifying world to live in.

No. Cheap gimmick.  
Try mixing in the taste of dirty sweat socks. Also a cheap gimmick, but will appeal to a wider audience.
