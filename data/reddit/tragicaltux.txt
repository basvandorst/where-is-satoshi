Except, that somebody who dug up all my chests and stole my coins, was actually me, with a different stupid hat.  
And I go an switch back hats and come to work and say, oh no!  We done got robbed!

This is the reason why some animals eat thier young.  
Anyone, who wants to harass, persecute, name call, insult, insinuate, aggrivate, or make any assumptions about anyone who had a single satoshi in MtGox can **fuck off**. 
**It is doublespeak** to hold bitcoin while at the same time to refer to any person or group of persons who lost at MtGox in a negative manner.
**One should examine oneself** for a very long time before thinking of condemning others.
**PEACE to all my brothers &amp; sisters who lost any or all with MtGox**

sorry for being confusing...  intent was to show that someone within, perhaps even MK leaked it.

But it's really nice to see this post from in-line.  Your style of thinking towards the people who lost, is inhuman.  
You are the worst type and to call yourself greedy would be a compliment.
**To YOU and the rest of those biological entities who are consuming the air on my planet, I have a very short message... fuck you.**

I think a LOT of people are watching this guy, the true scope and maginitude of the whole problem is really unknown to the public.  
 Anyone wish he put all of his embarassing pictures up on Gox *before* we sent everything?  If I saw something like this *aka* the CEO, I wouldn't even have to think twice about sending a dime!
** It's all we want.  Truth. We want it all **
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man,
'We are programmed to receive.
You can check out any time you like,
But you can never leave!' 
 - Mark Marie Robert Karpelès, CEO. Tribute to the Eagles via MtGox...
Mark, I truely hope that you find a way to find forgiveness with God, more than anything.  Secondly, I hope that you recover the coins and redeem yourself publicly.

Tibane is MINE!   Either my bitcoins come back, or I bought a cat.   
Looks like I know what I'm having for dinner soon!  
&amp; roasted Tibane legs!

Since we really know very little. The true information that has come out is a few news announcements on mtgox main page.  A big press release in Japan shorty after it all happened...   
EVERYTHING ELSE is pure speculation...
I share your dream and see it like this; it's just an equal of a possibility as all of the listed scenarios everywhere else.   Hacked, stolen, lost, inside job, restructure, governmnent intervention, etc...     
Who knows?  Mark Karpeles and maybe a few more close to him.  I see a little weight on the government getting involved with tracing and tracking money, perhaps this is a good cover for him while he gets everything sorted out.  
Again, who knows...   
But it's really nice to see your post and your style of thinking, unlike all of rest who laugh, and are happy that people lost in Gox.   To those biological entities who are consuming up some of the air on my planet, I have a very short message...   fuck you.

I'll take 10!  because Tibane has 9 lives, and after the first 9 I'll have the art perfected....

leaked database isn't proof in my book.
Possibility:   Gox leaked it so that customers could retrieve thier balance information &amp; anything else being leaked.
Snowden came from within the NSA &amp; later leaked thier own docs, think about it...
