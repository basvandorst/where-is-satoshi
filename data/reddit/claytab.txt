I triggered a 35% drop within 8 hours, I must have bought before you. Dw.

Yeah, I think part of my frustration all comes in wanting to invest in altcoins as well, but when I look at the prices I am so shocked. Like who in their right mind would invest in a coin that grew 500% in a month, but next thing you know, that coin grows 1000%. 
Personally, I want to be in an investor in this market but it scares the heck out of me, especially knowing how volatile the coins are when Bitcoin rises and fall.

I feel like we all know deep down inside, Bitcoin is going to 7K but its like, we just don't want to believe.

I did that today with some of my alts...bought back in.....and it went lower.

At this rate I am going to break even with my investment. Plz not below.

My weekly rant because I am still a noob.
I don't understand the point of 95% of the tokens out there and what am I going to possibly do with it.
Bitcoin I understand, its a currency that I can potentially buy a Doritos bag with at some point in my life. What exactly am I going to do with an alt-coin that is designed only for online gaming, photography or casino, when I don't use any of that stuff.
This coin space is really getting redundantly ridiculous. Everything seems vastly inflated. Yes, I admit, I am a bit jealous of people who made millions investing in terrible alt-coins, and maybe I am venting for this reason. But I also admit that I can't invest in a token or a coin which I deem virtually useless to me as a person and rather extremely high for the purpose it is designed for. 
I feel each token is only useful to those that are actually going to use that platform. The funny thing is a lot of us (including myself) never ever ever ever plan on using those platforms. We are literally just playing with digital codes and trading them based on news and speculation, or gambling in hopes it will increase a percent or two. 
Not meant as a FUD, its just something I am really trying to get my head around.

I just need to rant and get this off my chest. Sorry, didn't know where else to discuss this. 
Honestly, getting frustrating holding Bitcoin, not because I don't believe in it, just the pure manipulative actions taking against it.
Somehow these terrible alt-coins go up 1000%, and Bitcoin somehow dives likes 40%. It would have been nicer to have steady growth, but how does a coin go up from 13000 to 17000 in 2 days, and drop back to 13000 like no tomorrow. 
Screw Coinbase, screw CNBC, screw Bcash.

That is just ridiculous to say, no way are they going to zero.

That is a weird thing to say. Are you saying you don't want companies to accept Bitcoin, even though our purpose is to have companies accept them.

Why are all the alts falling today? Is there a major reason? They were all still going up, when Bitcoin was around 11-14,000.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:08:36
It was dipping today when Bitcoin was going up as well tho, except for a very minute amount of coins.

Quadriga is good and allowed to use Interac. Vancouver based I believe.
