Sure. The graph shows you the price of the different futures. If you are long a January future, you agree to receive 1 BTC when the future expires at the price you bought the future. If you are short the future, you agree to provide 1 BTC at the price you sold. The futures have different prices because of the relationship between the spot and the future. Let me explain with oil futures. I can sell an oil future, buy the oil today on the spot market and store it till the future expires and I have to deliver the oil. My profit on this trade should be 0 in efficient markets. So, the farther out the oil future is, the more it should cost because storing oil costs money, the longer you store it, the more money.
How this applies to BTC is not clear. Why are there differences in prices between the futures? And why the premium to the spot price? We will learn more as the futures trade more. In the meantime, follow the data and see if there are trading opportunities. Good luck.
