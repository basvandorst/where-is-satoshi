Please donate everyone. I'm not with DW (obviously), but I recognize how important this project is. 
Here's some motivation: 
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:39:13
Well if you use bitcoin and immediately replenish your bitcoin, you didn't really lose any money.
And while the problem you present still exist, I find buying every week (price averaging) has done a good job in mitigating any losses. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 06:52:42
Haha, sorry Alex. I thought you were just some random guy who drove around a Bitcoin labeled car in some random city. Like a redbull car or something. Didn't read the post or register what this was. Welcome.
You should download a wallet and post your address publicly so you can play around with bitcoin if you get any donations (talking bits worth here).
To anyone else wondering, donating is pretty easy. Follow the crowdtilt link above and select donate in bitcoin. They just give you an address to send it to. No info required. I don't personally find this to be the best way to "spread bitcoin awareness", but I also find it at least entertaining so I donated a little. 
In the spirit of the AMA: Have you have raced for pink slips? Or any high stakes bet for that matter? 
Also, do you drive or race in anything else on the side? Talking bike races, foot races, congressional races, pod races, rat races, amazing races, etc.

I'm no expert on BTC history, but:
Aren't his coins essentially dead? As in, those early wallets with hundreds of thousands of coins haven't moved in years? Then wouldn't a sudden movement in coins crash the price (and by crash I don't mean to 0 necessarily) as people would panic and non-hodlers (day traders) would be scared of a large amount bitcoins entering the market and thus sell. 
If transaction volume is high enough, this doesn't really matter, but if it were to happen tomorrow, I would be surprised if there wasn't a substantial drop. 
Not saying that price is the most important thing in my opinion or that I have all the facts straight. Just thinking out loud here.

As someone from the internet, I can verify this.
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:23:19
Yeah, but you can't really blame them. They're believers. They know, if a company wants fiat, they'll take the bitcoin and give them fiat, cause hey, bitcoin is preferable. 
What will eventually solve this issue is open source software for merchants to easily accept bitcoin.

But that Dom Mazetti reference though...
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:48:57
"(Merchant-&gt;USD) &gt; (Consumer-&gt;BTC)" 
This is what most people believe is contributing to the downtrend. But don't Bitpay and Coinbase hold their coins? Is it the equivalent of Bitpay and Coinbase just buying the coins at market price through the transaction? (thus not really affecting the price)
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:35:21

I wouldn't be so sure. I expected the price to rise after the regulation announcement. A lot of establishment types (with money) are for it and would then jump it.
A portion of merchant adoption is already factored into the price. The price won't increase drastically unless merchant adoption exceeds an unknowable threshold. 
Also, merchant adoption provides downward pressure because it is immediately exchanged for fiat. Although I think this pressure is small. 
The key is mass user adoption. What do I mean by mass, I mean unexpected levels or unknowable levels. 
Price goes up. Price goes down. You can't explain that.

I would say a little less than 4.67. 
You would have to pay slightly more than market price (usually). But probably not much more. 
4.1 is most likely a rip off.

But bitcoin doesn't eliminate your debt-based money paradigm that you describe. Can you elaborate? People can borrow bitcoin and have to pay back with interest (talking real interest rates) . Unless you're simply talking about the USA --&gt; Fed debt, which in my personal opinion, is not great, but also not the biggest problem with our current system.

Price is arbitrary. Trade it bits and the moon becomes the stars. So "low" is completely irrelevant and just wrong.
There is an argument for stability. Honestly, I don't care. I just price average and don't worry myself with short term or marginal gains/losses. It'll go up and down and in the end I'll be somewhere in the middle (ish). Sure, if it dropped 50%, I'd pick up as much as I could at the time, but that's about it. 
I was in the red for a while, but I just kept buying weekly regardless or price and now I'm pretty much even. (first time I bought was at 820 for reference).

Don't know why ^ is getting downvoted. 
But to answer OP, if you do it, give it in a physical form. Print the private key to some high quality paper (or something). You can get creative too. For instance, if you were gifting a male friend something, you could gift them a wallet and inside could be btc printed to a piece of paper in the shape and likeliness of the dollar.

I was in a similar situation and did a similar thing. However, I bought substantially more (in terms of dollars spent) when price was below 400 and 500. I'm more or less even.
