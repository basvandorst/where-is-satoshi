Omfg dude, you don't need to write a novel when it's 95% bullshit. The peso and dollar both came from the Spanish empire peso.


Wrong. The gold standard was adopted at the end of the 19th century, the dollar had been in existence for a century prior to the gold standard. Not to mention pegging isn't a requirement for currency, currency used to be made from fixed weights of silver and/or gold but "fixed" wasn't permanent. Prior to floating US currency and the gold standard the fixed weight of gold changed devaluing US currency. 
You don't seem to understand even the most basic concepts here, why are you even commenting?


Oh I see now, you are just a fanboi with a Paulbot economics education. SMH

One it's not a monetary policy and its predictability is based on sliding difficulty to keep the average daily mining rate constant. If the US government wanted to set a finite amount of dollars it could also release 7200 dollars a day until May of 2140. You should ask yourself why they wouldn't do that and you'll possibly begin to understand how ridiculous you sound and what's wrong with your assertion.

This won't happen it would be banned first. 


It's not worthless and it won't be. It's the same reason the US dollar isn't worthless because the Mexican Peso exists. Not to mention even in a world of electronic banking and transactions there are still many people who use only cash. There are also many people in the world with zero access to technology.


This is a terribly uninformed comment. Economic busts have been far less painful since the invention and implementation of central banking. The government is the reason our currency has value at all, I'd hardly say they are stealing anything.
Where in the hell do you people come up with this nonsense?

Which central bank manages difficulty level? 


The federal reserve doesn't print money, the US mint does that.


Because you don't even understand how the current system works, all of your assertions are stupid. 
I'm done wasting time with you happy holidays
