Actually... Would it be possible to pay yourself via LN? I imagine all you would need is somebody you already have a channel with having a roundabout connection with Amazon, and then it all goes back to you. 
It may just be that Carl's route is the cheapest and everyone wants to use it, but there is another way round that Carl can use to fund himself

To use LN right now, you need an LN node. Lite nodes are in the works, but nothing is ready yet. If you want to use LN atm, you will have to manually put Bitcoin into a few channels. As we progress further into how the tech works, I can see people who will load up a wallet that is on the lightning network from the start and that will be your phone or hot wallet. 
There is no "threshold" for how many LN nodes we need before people can use it without knowing. It's an opt-in network right now.

Bitcoin Core is a piece of software. You can run many types of Bitcoin clients that all work with the network/ledger that Bitcoin Core connects to and processes.

Here's the problem: if you sell a hardware node, people will buy it and never update it. You would have to rely on the company who sold it to apply automatic updates, which goes against the fundamental mindset behind Bitcoin.

Yes. In a sense, the risk of centralization isn't going to come from massive "hubs" in the wheel and spoke situation. I think that any centralization risk is going to come from some companies having the best UI/UX in their wallets that don't require the user to understand anything about the technology. They will be the ones holding the funds and running lightning nodes. They will pay for the channel opening fees and not even bother to inform their users how any of it works (mostly because people don't generally need to know) and their service will become something like Coinbase has become. It will be popular, it will be pretty, and the majority of their users won't understand anything except that they "have" some Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:52:01
If I understand correctly, most SPV wallets only use headers. Sending TX data to these wallets would require querying a full node for the information. If it's in the header, then these SPV wallets don't have to rely on the mempool and can actually see what the previous minimum fee was.
I haven't done my full research on SPV wallets, so correct me if I'm wrong.

Nobody knows the answer to this question. Bitcoin supply will run out in the year 2140, which is a long time from now in human terms. 
The supply per block halves once about every 4 years (210,000 blocks). If you have ever taken an algebra class, you may have heard of asymptotes. That is how the Bitcoin supply is going to go out. Our asymptote of supply is around 21 million full Bitcoins. The rate of supply decrease will be so gradual near the end that no one is likely to really care besides people who are watching the tech and still want to watch.
For some perspective: the last 4 years of Bitcoin creation will involve a reward for miners of 1 Satoshi per block. This will have created the last Bitcoin to ever be created (assuming no changes are made to the protocol) and there should exist a total of 20,999,999.9769 Bitcoin.

For those who want to read a rebuttal to this comment, here is an explanation of why this is unlikely to be a problem:
The Lightning Network is called a "Network" because it is like a web of interconnected nodes. Making one channel with their favorite service will give them a connection to virtually every other node out there. For most people, this is enough. There is already software (lnd) which automatically opens a few channels to start connecting to the network. You can usually connect to almost all nodes with 3 to 8 channels. This is not too expensive, either, because it is possible to create multiple channels with one on-chain transaction.
This kind of FUD should not be given any attention until we actually have a well-used mainnet lightning network. We will not know how things will truly work until we get there. 
Looking at the way things are going, most layman users won't even be aware that their money is in channels, or that they're using the lightning network. Not many people who use the Internet as it is now understand packet routing or TCP/IP, and neither will people need to understand the network we use for BTC payments.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:04:46
OP is probably referring to the people who want to fire the man who made the FUD announcement.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:15:38
Transactions on LN will be impossible to count. If you're asking about fees, almost zero for a while. It all depends on the cost of running a node and what people start to perceive as being a fair fee. In this network, it is very unlikely we will ever see a situation where high or increasing fees are ever necessary unless the cost of electricity and/or processing power skyrockets.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:31:05
At the moment, yes. There is no mainnet lightning light client yet.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:20:30

That's even *more* confusing! Some would hear you saying "dissent" or would think you're calling something "decent". 
"How much is this?"
"Half decent each."
"... What?"
Clever, but I don't think it would catch on. Bit is just too easy to say and the everyday person won't even know about the data measurement. The context of a sentence is more than enough to realize that someone is talking about a price and not their internet speed.

Well atm SegWit isn't even the default address that bitcoind (Core) gives you. You have to ask for a SegWit address specifically. From [this link:](




Edit: So it's not difficult to implement, but companies who want to write code and never look at it again won't want to have to go back and fix things if the default changes.
I don't think this is a good excuse, but I can see where company priorities would just have programmers wait until it's "official"

@_date: 2018-01-27 20:23:47
There are multiple implementations of LN and the transactions on the network don't affect any dev team. The only thing they are worried about is that some people may start to lose their BTC and blame them. It will never hold up, of course, because every implementation is currently dissuading people from using LN on mainnet. All real BTC put into the LN is at-your-own-risk.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:50:22
Not trying to be a grammar Nazi, just hoping to be helpful since you asked :-)








@_date: 2018-01-17 12:46:22
Yes. LN nodes are pretty light weight to run. The big thing when it comes to smart phones is that even if you have the whole node on your phone, you would need to keep your phone awake and listening because there is no server watching transactions and waking up your phone only when you receive a transaction. If you have the "watcher" on your laptop and it is always watching, you can theoretically wake up your phone's software whenever a new transaction comes in. 
Your laptop would also have two options (this is the kind of back end complexity that comes with 2nd layer stuff):
1. Run a full node with a wallet and verify your own transactions.
2. Run an SPV client which relies on other nodes found on the network to verify transactions and track a balance.
In both cases, you would need a live "watcher", a Bitcoin wallet (however you wish to do that), and then the cell phone "listener" to show your LN balance and create new transactions. This way, you can have two trusted devices remembering transactions and balances.
It's likely that some future Bitcoin wallets will ship as "lightning" wallets and won't ever hold an actual Bitcoin balance as we do it now. Any balance sent to these wallets is immediately sent to a lightning channel and any Bitcoin moved out of it to a normal wallet will be like closing the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:26:38
Plus, any node connected to you will ignore you if it can find a cheaper route through other nodes. You might collect fees, but they will likely only cover the cost of your electricity (if it even covers 10% of that cost)

@_date: 2018-01-22 01:53:28
... Full nodes are part of what power most, if not all, wallets. If the miners try to change protocol, full nodes won't accept the blocks and wallets won't see the change. How is that irrelevant?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:47:28
The way Charlie Lee wants to implement it, the miner would be locked into only accepting transactions above the broadcasted fee. Other miners who want to pick up on those lower-fee transactions can then snatch them up while others are missing out on mining those (likely more numerous) low-fee transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:28:48
Uh... I am pretty disappointed by that :-(
They did have some math problems in the past, tho. When I had the wallet set to bits, I would type in an amount and the wallet would say I didn't have that much Bitcoin. The UI said bits, but the programming was still in BTC. Maybe they wanted to simplify their workload.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:31:24
In case anyone else doesn't feel like looking it up:
A pull request is what happens when somebody wants to merge their code with a repo (repository/project). When the owner/manager of the repo gets a pull request, it is a request for them to examine and "pull" this new code into the existing repo.
In the context of large open-source projects, a team of reviewers usually looks over the code in the pull request and tests it extensively on their own computers/test networks before merging it into the full repo.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:23:44
Since SegWit was introduced to Core, it had been CLI (command line interface) only and was not something you could get by default in the UI (user interface). Essentially, SegWit work was only half finished and a lot of exchanges and services don't want to bother with SegWit until the reference software (Bitcoin Core) fully supports it. This new PR (pull request) will merge the new SegWit code to finish the initial implementation so that companies who don't like programming that much can implement SegWit in all it's glory.
**Actual ELI5:**
Some people made a tool that others use to make money. They invented a feature for their tool that would make the tool better, but only built the basic parts. That means it was difficult for those other people to use it at first. Now, those tool makers are about to finish the work they started and make it easier for everyone to use the new feature.
When it comes to standards, companies don't like to implement half-baked or early software. If something drastic changes along the way, they have to dive back into their code and reconfigure/fix their implementation before they can update their software to the full (final) version. I think that for companies who value the testing and work which goes into Bitcoin Core (or just don't want to implement it on their own), it is a good idea to wait for the feature to be fully tested and completed. I don't hold much against Coinbase and other companies for waiting so long (as long as they implement SegWit in the end). In their eyes, the software they rely on (Core) is not finished and the feature everyone is cramming for isn't ready.

This. This is why the difficulty adjusts on a bi-weekly basis. If the fees stayed at zero and big miners fell out, it would still remain at a competitive difficulty. The only risk in that scenario is that miners will be able to jump in with their old hardware (why would they still have it if it isn't profitable to use?) and would start creating blocks extremely fast, clearing the mempool and reducing the fees they jumped in for. It doesn't make sense unless they just want to grab the fees. 
In any case, this is good for Bitcoin fees from the user's side or decentralization on the network side. It has its own way of balancing out.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:28:11

I see a few scenarios where this could work, and I appreciate your viewpoint.
I do see an issue, however: what about roads in between cities? Would the county or jurisdiction you live in charge some kind of fee to maintain surrounding roads? What about rural roads that three or four families use? 
You can expand this argument pretty far out, but eventually you end up with the state managing roads in their state (the way it mostly is now), and that's covered by state taxes.
Do you think we could track usage with GPS data attached to each car? Without a pool of finances to cover edge cases, I am having trouble imagining a nation-wide or even global system where this would work without something very similar to taxes.
I'm open to hearing your side of this. I want to expand my thinking, and if you have a solution, I'm all ears :-)

What kind of property are we talking about? Money?
I guess we just have different ways of looking at this, then. 
I see taxes as me contributing to a safer and more convenient society that I'd like to live in. I really enjoy being able to get police help if I need it. I like having roads and schools to use and attend. When everything is bundled into one (ideal) system, things become cheaper and the cost of providing these service goes down. 
In the case of healthcare, the United States are still stuck in a corporate loop of greed and inconsistency. Many countries around the world have already figured out that single payer healthcare helps to regulate things and keep costs in check. I'd rather live in Canada, pay a healthcare tax, and receive it for free when I need it than pay several thousand dollars that I don't have to a hospital who only cares about making money off my treatment instead of providing me with the most effective medicine. 
My vision for Bitcoin includes a motivation to recreate these systems with transparency and authenticity in mind. I want a system that will allow us to more easily hold companies and governments accountable for supporting their customers or citizens in the way they claim they are.
If that doesn't sound like a world you want to live in, then I suppose we willing just have to respectfully disagree and move on.

I'm sorry, but this doesn't help much. It just creates flame wars that will never truly end. We need educators and explorers. If you don't know how to code, tell your friends and local businesses about Bitcoin. Get the word out. Help test new projects. Learn. Educate. Multiply. The more normal the word Bitcoin begins to sound, the more easy it will be for the currency's usage to spread. Even if businesses initially want to use services like BitPay to reduce their volatility risks, that is only one middleman they need to remove in the future to start taking Bitcoin themselves.
Be proactive and positive. If there are scams out there, call them out by telling people why they are to be avoided. Don't just bash them without any supporting evidence or solutions for those who don't know better. 
Help those in need and Bitcoin will keep being a positive force in the world.

All you need is Bluetooth/NFC or a display to send someone a BTC transaction in plain text. This would be like an IOU to the network. This is how the Lightning Network works. The network itself is just a method of sending IOUs to people over the Internet in a secure and private way.

I would agree with all of this, but I can't agree with not getting a different wallet where you control the keys. If you start keeping your BTC on Coinbase, you're getting into a dangerous mindset. 
Get started with wallets now. It's a very good way to learn about Bitcoin and how to manage your money.
On Android, get [Samourai Wallet](
For iPhone, go ahead with [BRD Wallet](
These two will provide you with a 12-48 word seed that will allow you to restore your Bitcoin if you ever lose or break your phone. With these words, you can restore your balance using any wallet that takes in backup words.

Ideally, if there are rarely "disputes" on the LN, we will rarely have to take them to "court" (the main chain).

Approximately every two weeks, mining difficulty is readjusted so that the average block time remains around 10 mins. This is what will happen if miners start dropping out. In this situation, the lottery for the next block becomes much more likely to fall on you or your pool. This encourages people to start mining again and keeps things in relative balance.
Lots of people bring up the concern of miners losing profits without taking into account the fact that miners receive all the fees from transactions in the block they create. By the time the block reward begins to take a toll on miner profits, some will drop out \(refer to scenario above\) or rely on user fees for profits. By this time, it's expected that the network will have enough transactions to support a significant fee market on the main network. 
It is also expected that by this time users will primarily use the Lightning Network for day\-to\-day transactions and the main chain will be occupied by businesses making massive transaction with a high need for security. These larger transactors will be willing to pay the relatively small price for the main chain transaction.
All of this is personal speculation and I can't say that it will all come true. I do believe that the network will always be supported by those who care about the network and will always have small\-time miners; no matter how low the difficulty or reward becomes.

Do I understand correctly that a hard fork would divide the Bitcoin network into two separate networks? Please correct me if I'm wrong, but that would cause quite a bit of stress for people who already have invested in the current network. All of us would have to take a side and lose lots of funds if we chose the wrong side. I agree it's messy, but sometimes that is necessary. We had a chance to do it right the first time, but that chance is gone now that millions of people are using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-18 12:08:26
It's nice to have an opposing opinion and view on topics. Thank you. 
I'm not sure that your concern about nodes going offline is entirely grounded, however. When a transaction is made on the LN, a temporary transaction is created with a timeout. I'm sure you're aware of this. If a node goes offline, the party who made the transaction would easily be able to submit their original transaction independently to the block chain. This transaction would have a time based lock on it, so it would require them to wait before they can use the funds, but they would not lose said Bitcoin.
As for your concern about nodes not having enough set aside for transactions; it seems like it would be easy enough to just open a new channel between two people for the required amount. Granted, if this is a single transaction, that doesn't help load on the block chain much but longer-term channels would at least help.
I agree that the issue of fees is currently unknown. Hopefully it will be low enough for the lightning network that we won't need to worry. It's also possible, I believe, to have zero fees if you use your own node and a direct connection to the payee. I'm not entirely knowledgeable on how that works, however

Technically speaking, no it doesn't. 
At the moment, though, it's only developed for SegWit. Without SegWit, there are security holes that would need to be "hacked" into existing code. That gets messy, so if we can bundle them together, why not?
@_date: 2017-02-17 14:06:54
You make a good point, but maybe I'm missing something. I am imagining the LN (which Segwit enables) as the bikers, not Segwit as the bikers. I see how Segwit makes things a bit more complex for the trucks because the tracking process is more complex, but I don't see how that equals a trailer with other packages on it. 
As I understand it so far, Segwit changes the way that information is stored on the trucks so that all the signatures they collect are stored on a single sheet of paper instead of a series of labels for each package. It takes longer now to aggregate everything onto one sheet, but it opens up to more enhancements down the road.
With the Lightning Network in place, the trucks would only need to worry about two packages from their cyclists with each set of trading channels on the LN. One to transfer the goods to each person and one to settle things after they're done (the metaphor kind of falls apart on the logic of this one).
I disagree with your last paragraph, however. If we manage to get LN in place, why would anyone move to a network of big trucks if our network of cyclists with big trucks as a backbone is already cheap to run? The argument given here is that a block size increase would give us cheaper rates, but LN would as well. I just don't see how being fearful of an alt-coin migration is an argument for a block size increase over Segwit/LN.
Thanks for the logical debate. This is refreshing

Everyone runs nodes that all run using the same rules. If someone tries to mine a block that doesn't follow these rules, their block won't be accepted by other nodes. There is no "consensus algorithm", everyone is just running compatible software.
@_date: 2017-02-17 13:06:46
I know this whole debate revolves around a major block size increase vs Segwit/LN so let me try to play the other perspective. I think a slight modification to your metaphor will help here: instead of a bus, we'll use a delivery truck.
There's a really, really great delivery service that everyone loves to use, but they only have 100 trucks in a small town. Soon, people hear about the service and want to use it. The town grows into a large city and the delivery service realizes they don't have enough trucks; they are beginning to fill up. The delivery service soon has to start charging more for packages in order to get them anywhere without reaching their capacity. 
Some people are upset because they can't afford to send their letters or small packages to their friends who live around the block. Around this time, someone realizes that the whole service can be expedited using cyclists as a separate service for short, simple, trips (the Lightning Network). These cyclists relieve the 100 trucks service of a lot of smaller packages that don't need to travel very far. They still report back to the main delivery service with a summary of the goods they've transferred, but the trucks only need to carry the report, not all the packages that the cyclists delivered. Sometimes the cyclists even take packages from facilities and travel the last mile to ease the load on the 100 trucks.
I really believe that Segwit, along with the LN, will really help our situation of increasing the block size. In this metaphor, Segwit is an upgrade to the trucks where they will be able to carry more packages at once, and the Lightning Network is the creation of the cyclist service, taking care of smaller transactions between people who don't need their package to travel across the city.
What do you think?
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:39:57
haha wouldn't that be nice /s
I really feel like it is not as big an issue for LN to become centralized. In fact, it may be in some companies' interest to have an LN node to track their customers and keep track of their channels. I imagine companies will start making LN networks for their own company. I can imagine someone like Starbucks making "Starcoins" to help them track customers. Maybe we'll get "iCoins" in the future. 
It may seem like a bad thing here, but if companies get the benefit of tracking their customers, they may even operate nodes for free. It's even possible to run a node that pays users to run their transactions through the node (essentially a negative fee).
In the case of LN, it does not make sense to charge large fees because software automatically picks the cheapest/shortest route. Nodes will collect fees, but there is no way to monopolize the network. No "hash power". No way to "steal fees from competitors. It's just whoever provides the best service gets the traffic.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:47:08
The reason this is different is that there is no proof of work needed to forward and support users on the LN. It's essentially just catching and passing on transactions and then charging a fee for the service. The LN will calculate the cheapest/shortest path using existing nodes and that will help drive down the fees for users.

I'm not sure if you misread that or have a typo. They said "root", not "roof". Perhaps they mean "How are the two coins different at the most basic level?"
If I were to take a stab at it:
BU is a smaller group of developers that wants to allow dynamic changes to the block size in a way that is unproven and seems very risky to many people. 
Core is a large group of developers who want to scale efficiently, carefully, and with mass consensus, preventing their major changes from activating until a large majority of the community agree.

SegWit blocks essentially move certain items out of the block, but don't violate any hard rules the pre-SW nodes and miners follow. Old nodes won't be able to validate blocks, but will still accept them as valid and will forward them through the network. BU blocks have the potential to break these rules and fork off of the current chain. 
The only thing that SW does is have miners begin to make SW blocks that will stack on top of current blocks as well as new SW blocks.

It seems to be that way. The majority of users, exchanges, and businesses want SegWit because of the obvious benefits. Miners seem afraid of it because they aren't sure how the fee market will react. It seems to me, however, that miners without a huge financial stake in the market are either pro-SegWit or simply anti-SegWit, but not necessarily pro-BU
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:57:22
Did you know that SegWit _is_ a block size increase? Even if SW is only a temporary fix for what you expect we need, it does open the doors to more fixes and changes in the future. There is so much innovation just waiting for SW in order to be released. 
I don't understand the opposition that some users have to SW. For miners to be skeptical it makes sense, but users should be all for Segregated Witness since it bundles a lot of features and improvements into one package.

It is important to point out, however, that the longest chain refers to the longest chain that your node accepts. In the case of a hard fork, there are enough people rejecting new blocks and the rules and consensus diverge.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:34:17
Eventually, it may become necessary.  It's just odd when you say 


...when SW is a block size increase (in terms of how much space is allotted to transactions). Do you mean that we need the ability to scale the block size more easily? 
I'm trying to understand what you mean by requesting a block size increase while dismissing SW (a block size increase with extra scoops of ice cream)
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:08:20
Yeah, the block size of transactions stays the same (1MB), but the space for signatures adds more so that the total space per block can be 4MB.
The older nodes ignore this new data, so they perceive it as a normal block. The total of 4MB is providing more space for future enhancements, but transactions are still limited to the 1MB
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:38:54
LN *is* a side chain, as I understand it. The issue is that transactions are currently malleable on the blockchain. This makes it unsafe to "transfer" coins between chains. If Segwit is implemented, it fixes this malleability problem and allows us to have proper and safe side chains, enabling the deployment of the Lightning Network
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:07:26
Well, it's not saying it would work every time, but if they have 24 hours to launch another attack, and they get a chance to create a block every ten minutes, 0.7% is the point where that would be likely to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:02:01
Okay. I agree with you on two things:
1. The block size may need to be upgraded in the future due to the high demand for the Bitcoin blockchain (This is especially considering a situation without any Lightning networks)
2. SegWit is not a literal change in the block size, but it does allow the inclusion of at least twice the transactions that blocks can currently handle (which is the entire point of a size increase, right?)
Where I think we may differ is on what needs to be done. I have trouble seeing why people want to wait to activate SegWit. They push for hard-forks to increase the block size, but don't want SegWit (a soft fork increase). Why is that? Do you have an opinion on this, or are you trusting other people to decide for you?
There's nothing wrong with taking other people's word for things, but it's always better to research ideas and form your own opinion based on what you learn on your own.
What's the point of rejecting a solution just because it isn't the one you like? If a block size increase for the purpose of more transactions per block is your goal, then why not SW? Why push for a hard-fork instead?

It's entirely possible that the person who sent you the $1 using CoinBase's service sent it using a wallet app which uses a different pricing source than CoinBase. In their wallet, they sent $1 based on the price of BTC at Bitfinex, for example, and that varied slightly from what CoinBase was reporting the price to be. Because of that, you received less BTC than CoinBase was expecting. In reality, it's all relative to how much you value BTC.
Someone using the CoinBase app would likely send exactly what CoinBase expects. Anyone else may have some variance. This is the confusing world of Bitcoin, and it's only now starting to become easier to understand.

It's a bit complex, but fees are calculated based on the size of your transaction measured in bytes on a computer. If the transaction has a lot of old inputs (smaller transactions bunched together to make a total), then the fee can get expensive. The only way to really know the fee is to go through the transaction process until the final confirmation (without sending the transaction). The total size (in bytes) of the transaction and the total fee should be visible there. There isn't really a way to be sure what the fee will be without sitting down and doing the math yourself.

For evidence, just look up how many stories there are on here about people losing access to their funds which were stored on an exchange. They believe that the Bitcoin is theirs, but, for now, the exchange has locked them up.

With SegWit, miners no longer have a choice. It may initially hurt their fees, but in the end things should be able to level out as more and more people are able to join the network. LN is independent of Core and relies on special locks to keep Bitcoin locked up while an LN channel is active. 
The theory atm is that people will rely on an LN to make the majority of their transactions and only settle back to the blockchain once a year/month. This will make it possible to support the number of transactions we need to while keeping the blocks small. 
This is all theory and we don't have any real world evidence that this works, but many tests have been run and the technology works on the test net.

There will be a lot of news to go around if those coins ever move, but it won't destroy the economy or anything like that. 
Also, , only a small group of people on Reddit actually consider themselves smart or very intelligent compared to their peers. And most of them are wrong...

An easy-to-use form of BTC, just like you asked
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:35:15
There are a couple of good points in this thread, but I don't feel like they really capture why Bitcoin is important. 
The reason I think Bitcoin is important:
1. Bitcoin is the first form of currency that cannot be created indefinitely, as most Fiat currencies are. 
2. It is a currency that is not affected by borders (country borders or even digital borders/restrictions). 
3. It is a currency which has the potential to be a safe haven for those whose governments are corrupting their Fiat currency by inflation or other forms of mismanagement. 
4. It is a currency that is purely digital and governed by consensus, not a single entity.
For a lot of first world countries, the use-case for Bitcoin doesn't seem apparent; 
"We have services like PayPal, Cash, and Venmo. Why do we need another currency service that uses a weird and pointless currency?" 
We don't. But the rest of the world does. And we will; if we ever get fed up with our banks putting limits on our transfer rates, spying on every purchase we make, or charging ridiculous credit card fees to businesses, Bitcoin will be there. Waiting patiently and powerfully for the world to discover it.
@_date: 2019-04-22 11:10:19


I guess I was thinking about that in this point and in my closing statement, but it is good to pull that out and point to it. User spying and data selling is the main reason Americans and other first world citizens would prefer Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:31:19
I have to agree with the other commenter here: I don't use Apple Pay, but I do use Google Pay, and from my experience, support is just increasing in my area.
Anyway, enough about a bad analogy.
So if I understand you correctly, you are bothered that the way you are temporarily storing your USD makes *you* and other people a bit more wealthy for a bit? I'm not sure I follow your thoughts there. 
I understand being worried about it all being a temporary trend. That's understandable. I understand being upset about the amount of BTC mindless promotion that goes on in this sub. That's also understandable.
What I don't understand is shitting on people and accusing them of being in a pyramid scheme when the terminology is completely wrong. The people spending time here obviously just want to gloat about or discuss their favorite currency. If you don't want to do that, then why spend time here. Why waste your attention on something that you consider useless and/or obsolete?
Spend your time on things you love. Be passionate about what you do. If you feel that an environment or past time is toxic to you, ignore it. There is so much more to life than disagreeing with people on the Internet. Go ahead and find your passion. Do what the people here are doing and have fun discussing something you care about. You're just hurting yourself by calling others schemers.

Yeah, just to start a transaction, you need to verify that you own the account by waiting an arbitrary number of days for a few transactions to go through. Then, you can make a transfer. Even then, it takes way too long to actually cross over.

Oh. I'm not sure there. I hope you find your answer.
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:57:19
Yeah, I totally see some companies popping up to host people's wallets as a service. Most of us who are currently in the space will likely run our own LN nodes and ping them through our phones to send transactions. I can just imagine people without the right knowledge wiping their phones or uninstalling their wallet app and losing all previous transactions on the channel.
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:04:42
A torrent would not be a good way to download the blockchain, since you are not verifying transactions. There is no point downloading and running a full node if you don't verify the entire chain first.
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:38:04
If you're a miner, why would you cherry pick high-fee transactions and disregard lower-fee transactions? That's a lot of moolah that you're missing out on. Other miners will take it. It doesn't make any sense to pick the top fees and *not* include the rest of the transactions to fill your next block.
@_date: 2019-04-21 23:56:10
Obviously. The debate here is how removing the block reward would affect the network. My argument is that the block reward doesn't affect the transactions that are chosen by miners.
The only change (as I said in another comment) is the hardware or number of miners running at a time.
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:59:53
Yeah... Why isn't that FAQ stickied anymore? They had a bunch of videos there. None on LNs, but there was at least a lot of educational stuff there.

Besides that, nice summary.
@_date: 2019-04-21 18:36:36
Yeah, but unless this miner has majority control over the mining ecosystem, other miners will pick up the other transactions.
What I'm saying is: there is absolutely no reason to ignore lower fee transactions if you can fit them in the block. The average user wouldn't be affected by the leave of a block reward, and miners would change the hardware they use to mine. They wouldn't change any other behavior.
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:05:52
There are a lot of features that come with SeqWit, but the change that is its namesake is that it Segregates Witness data. 
To boil it down: there are certain parts of a transaction that can be changed without changing the outcome of a transaction. The transaction ID is calculated using the entire transaction, including these malleable parts. SegWit moves all the parts of a transaction that are malleable into a separate section that is not used to calculate the transaction ID. In doing this, you guarantee that a transaction will always have the same calculated ID, no matter what changes other parties may make to the malleable parts.
This is really simplifying things, but if you want to get more detailed, check out [recommendation](

Current implementations of LNs are done in a Tor-like fashion. No one knows who the original sender was or who the recipient is. It's all encrypted and the only thing each node can see is who sent them money and who they are sending money to.


On-chain transactions are only likely to happen every month or year with a channel closing. These transactions are the culmination of all the transactions that happen while the channel is open. One transaction on-chain to open the channel, channel accumulates transactions over a year/month/whatever, and one transaction on-chain to settle and close the channel. Sure, the price per transaction could end up being ~$10 worth, but that's $20 for a year of transactions. I think that's certainly worth dropping all the credit card fees and company tracking that goes on in our system now.

I am aware that you could very well be a troll, but hear me out in case you are actually interested:
Pyramid schemes are defined as multi-level organizations which rely on people buying a product from the person above them and sending the profits upwards towards the top. 
Bitcoin is a single-layer asset that you are allowed to own some of, kind of like a stock. In this scenario, nobody is buying products and making the person above them richer, there is just an asset which becomes more valuable as more people desire to own some.
If you aren't convinced, then I challenge you to do your own, independent, research and prove to me that Bitcoin can be defined as a pyramid scheme. I'll be here.
If you are convinced, then welcome to the discussion! We're all here to learn :)

The problem is that companies who want a middle man to turn the BTC into Fiat will use BitPay. Obviously, this isn't great for the BTC network, but it does allow many more merchants to "integrate" BTC payments.
Until they become interested in accepting BTC by itself, we can't directly send them a transaction and have to deal with these idiotic companies.
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:12:17
People are trying to record their transactions into the blockchain and require that everyone sign their transactions to validate them. Some of this signature data is called witness data. Some hardworking developers figured out that the witness data can be trimmed away after a while and engineered a new way to measure the size of transactions that takes into account the weight of each transaction minus the witness data.
Old transaction fees were calculated using the transaction size (the amount of space required to store the data necessary to validate the transaction). New, SegWit, transaction fees are calculated by weight instead (weight is determined in such a way that old transactions are the same, and SegWit transactions are a bit lighter). 
Other people believe that SegWit won't be enough to support the volume of transactions necessary for wide spread adoption. They want to increase the size of blocks so that more transactions can be included in each block. 
The SegWit side wants to use transaction networks off chain to allow for massive traffic, whereas the big block side wants everything to happen on the blockchain.
The biggest issue here comes down to decentralization. With smaller blocks, it still remains possible for everyday computer owners to store the blockchain on their computer and run a node to verify transactions. With bigger blocks, the rate at which the blockchain grows could become exponential as the block size continues to increase and be readjusted.
This would require data centers and larger, centralized, companies to be the ones storing the blockchain and making most decisions. 
In the end, it is kind of a battle between those who have enjoyed and who trust the old way of money (bigger entities with established trust running and caring for everything) and those who wish to see a new type of currency emerge and succeed without the need for a centralized authority, giving the authority to each and every person who uses the technology.

The lightning network is just a secure network for sending and managing channels/transactions.

This is generally considered bad advice to build a Bitcoin understanding on. If you really want to own Bitcoin, please use a local wallet with a backup phrase. This ensures that you control the coins, and not Coinbase or another company. As Andreas Antanopolis classically said: "Not your keys, not your Bitcoin". This means if you don't directly control the keys which allow you to spend your Bitcoin, then Coinbase actually owns your coins and has promised an IOU for your coins when you ask for them. Only stick with an online wallet or exchange if you plan to exclusively trade.

There are a few technologies in the pipeline that will allow people to do things more easily off chain than the way it currently works:
There are channel factories; on-chain transactions that mix and mingle the opening and closing of many LN channels at once. This kind of tech can work within a closed group of people cooperating together or within an exchange. I'm sure there are other methods of using this without organization, but I am not aware of them atm. The main benefit of this tech is that people will be able to open and close many channels at once and save loads in on-chain fees.
Another technology that isn't quite ready yet is channel watching (don't remember the actual name of this method). This tech allows a channel creator to put a bounty on their channel which kicks in when the other side of the channel closes things with an out-of-date settlement (trying to claim a balance that is more than their current balance on the channel). When this bounty is set, it allows nodes which are monitoring the blockchain to catch the crook and claim the bounty in exchange for sending the channel balance to the other party (the same way it would work if your node caught the thief). This allows you to transaction online and rest assured that there are other nodes looking out for you while you're offline.
Other people are working on tech that would allow offline users to use lightning over NFC with a checkout terminal which is online. This allows people to save their phone battery and data plan while still being able to use LN.
I really don't see these technologies taking longer than a year or two to evolve into production-quality protocols. My hopes are high for the lightning network taking over. Especially when other cryptos start implementing and trading over it.
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:46:28
My point is that $70k won't be true for long with the price constantly fluctuating. The accurate amount would be in BTC or bits, with the dollar amount mentioned in the article or in parentheses.
Notation in BTC just makes more sense in this specific context (measuring the capacity of the Lightning Network)
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:02:03
Take your damn upvote
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:31:43
In terms of ease of setup, things just aren't there yet. It would require an IT guy on call if people running the business don't understand it yet. I would give the technology a little more growing time before jumping in and setting anything up for someone you aren't going to be on call to help.
In terms of converting it to FIAT, I think that's up to the business. If their employees want to get paid in BTC, easy! Otherwise, they'll have to use an exchange or find a service that works with them. Maybe BTCPay? I'm not entirely sure what all is backed into that, but it's definitely worth checking out.

@_date: 2018-04-29 18:49:43
Okay, I totally disagree about the lightning banks part, but I don't see it taking long for us to reliably be able to use LN in normal everyday life. The example I like to use is a scenario with someone who buys Starbucks often (everyone likes the coffee analogy). In this scenario, you set up your first channel with Starbucks, paying for your first coffee and filling the channel with future funds with *one* transaction on-chain. After that, it will be unlikely that you ever need to do anything else to continue using your new LN wallet. Starbucks won't take their servers down for random reasons. They will have channels with their associated businesses like Target, and this would let you use your funds to buy things at Target.
If you like, you can think of opening a channel with a company like getting a credit card from said company. They give you discounts and let you buy things with that discount at their respective associates. Instead of the discount (in this analogy), you would immediately be able to purchase things from those associates without setting up a new channel.
The best part? Once you have the channel open with these more permanent nodes, you can transaction with anyone else who shops there and has a channel set up.
I have the view that the LN will certainly have a few more permanent "hubs", but the option will always be available to transaction directly with your friends and other businesses without relying on these "hubs"

I would go with this info. Zero\-conf. transactions are great for most small exchanges, but you may want to store a phone number or other way of contacting the person if you want to have them increase the fee later on.
I would try doing some research on the Lightning Network and see if that would work for you. It's very early still, so I doubt many will be using it, and things will get simpler as more wallets implement the tech.

BTCPay seems to be the place to look for transacting in BTC with a business.

That argument goes both ways. Not trying to be mean; that statement just isn't an argument.
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:06:32
Exactly. It all depends on how you want to see it. In my original post, I'm trying to point out that the literal capacity is in BTC, not USD. If we were to imagine the network as a bag or bucket of sand, you wouldn't claim it had $20 worth of sand; it would have several pounds of sand.
I get why people want to immediately translate BTC to dollars. I was just thinking in a more direct way, I guess
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:09:03
I guess I'm thinking of things from a technical standpoint. In that sense, the network capacity is 1,029,000,000,000 mSats (might have done that math wrong

@_date: 2017-07-02 00:57:58
I noticed that typo, too
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:57:31
In theory. As long as people want their transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, there will be fees to ensure their transaction is added quickly
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:31:44
At the moment, yes. SegWit is set to improve that with smaller tx sizes, and lightning networks will only help. The potential for number of tx/sec on lightning networks is virtually infinite as long as it stays off-chain.
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:16:38
It doesn't mean they all open/close at the same time
@_date: 2017-07-04 12:08:10
It would take the same amount of time as making those transactions on-chain. I can't see why people are worried about opening channels. It doesn't use any more resources than normal on-chain transactions...
@_date: 2017-07-04 00:42:20
Yeah. I understand that. I do feel like people won't be opening them all at once, however. So 10 million people spread "evenly" across a year, using a year's worth of transaction time would be fine (I'm aware that there is no way to actually spread people out evenly in such a manner)
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:25:11
The ~~motivation~~ incentive to keep mining is supposed to come from the fees that people pay to have their txs included in the next block
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:05:55
No, I'm saying that people won't "sign up" for their "accounts" on the exact same day

I think this depends on how hands-on you want to be. Casa is definitely more managed by the Casa team, and raspiblitz is more linux-based with an easy setup.
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:55:36
These are, of course, valid points. If they bother you, wait for the tech to mature, or contribute the changes you want to see yourself.

You're awesome! Thank you!

Well, the reason some down voted you is that you didn't give any context for your argument. Reading this comment, your argument makes a bit more sense.
I'd challenge your unease with an alternative scenario: You know how we use reward systems with points in a lot of business settings these days? Usually, those points are locked to an account and can't be transferred around freely. I imagine what Andreas is thinking of is something akin to a points system being switched over to some kind of virtual, transferable, currency. This sort of use case makes sense in my book, but that's my opinion. You don't have to agree.
To argue for his support of Etherium, Andreas is a lover of information and education. He truly wants the best coin to win, and I don't disagree with him. It seems like he believes enough in Etherium to consider it a valuable topic to understand. This drives him to write books and discuss Etherium and the possibilities it brings to the table.
I think the world will evolve in it's own way, and there certainly won't be a single coin which is viable in a few years. We've had cash for millennia, but credit cards and debit cards haven't wiped it out. Heck, even gold is still valuable to us. That shit goes back even farther!
@_date: 2018-12-29 23:59:16
Yeah, this is the case. "Bitcoin Core" is the official client software written (and named) by the original team of developers. It is the software that runs the main chain, and has other versions written in other languages. 
"Bitcoin" is the name of the currency and protocol. "bitcoin" is used to refer to units or account balance.

@_date: 2019-05-20 12:03:34
Alright. Perhaps I have been misinterpreting his language. You've convinced me that Andreas has a flaw in this regard (as well as others, obviously. He's human). I still don't think he's "a shitcoin advocate". Even the video you're referencing wouldn't likely call him that. He's someone with his own views on things, and he has some flaws, sure, but the reason you got down voted earlier is that you immediately called him out on something with no support or reference. I'm glad we were able to talk about the details here. 
Thank you

It's probably part of Office 365, which is constantly updated
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:03:56
Lol already listening to the Cryptoconomy podcast and stacking sats ;)
I guess I also feel that the whole "war on shitcoins" is toxic. Obviously, I agree that Bitcoin is superior to them all, but we should try harder to promote and explain why Bitcoin is better instead of just shitting on any project that isn't Bitcoin. 
There are good projects out there. We should be trying to help them use Bitcoin for their case instead of them trying to create their own thing.

I suppose that's a good point. I just want everyone to realize already that exchanges should not be treated like a bank. It used to be that banks had to convince people to put their money in their vaults. They offered good interest rates and convenience. The only thing keeping people in banks now is the utter convenience of a debit card, and the social norms of doing so. I just hope that Bitcoin reaches the point where it sucks to keep funds in an exchange, and nobody trusts them besides trading.
@_date: 2018-12-17 02:45:33
This is a bad idea. Just take all your coins out now and don't get caught up in all the chaos that would happen if everyone actually did this on the same day. It should really be something that everyone does on a regular basis and never sends their coins back unless necessary.
@_date: 2018-12-30 04:45:33
Yeah... It is just helpful to know in case someone wants to talk about it or you want to know about sending to the wrong chain's address.
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:59:47
Three years old. Still cool
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:18:54
I don't think what you're looking for exists. The smart phone is perfect for the application you are asking about and isn't any less secure than a wallet with the same features. Is there a reason you don't want to use a smart phone wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:33:14
It's likely this is Lightning Network only (fees would exceed 100 sats quickly on the main chain)
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:51:38
I don't claim to be an expert, but this is how I understand it:
1. A payment channel is a series of transactions that link two users on the lightning network. 
2. Opening and closing a payment channel would rely on the method that the developer chooses to use in the app/program you decide to use for lightning transactions. It would generally involve locking some Bitcoin into an address that prevents it from being sent to anyone (including yourself) until the channel is settled on the blockchain. The amount sent is based on the total after all transactions in the channel are added up.
3. Theoretically, a channel can stay open forever. The catch is that each party has to store the transaction record or trust that the other user is sending you a proper copy. This means don't lose your phone, or trust a third party to store transaction history. If you trust the other party, then this could be a non-issue. But if both parties lose the transactions then none of it ever happened. That's the motivation to store the settled channel on the blockchain more often. For permanent storage.
4. Anyone who has software capable of locking Bitcoin into an address for transactions off-chain and trusts the other person to have done the same.
5. Not at the moment. Small fees may be charged by those who run relay nodes (these would help me send you a transaction if we didn't already have our own channel set up). If you have your own channel and a method of communication, then there is no middle man and absolutely no fees.
6. Networking magic. If you have a Bluetooth connection with your buddy, you could theoretically make transactions in the middle of the woods with no signal.
One big downside here is that you each need to lock away an amount of Bitcoin before beginning a channel. If my friend and I are always paying each other for pizza, and we each want to start with 1 Bitcoin in our channel, the maximum amount I could send to my friend is 1 Bitcoin and vice versa. When settling the channel on the blockchain we would end up with one of us gaining 1 Bitcoin, one of us losing 1 Bitcoin, or somewhere in between.
I imagine there are ways to later update the channel with more coins, but you would always have to wait for the first "locked in" transaction to confirm on-chain for true security.
I am still learning as well, so please correct me if I'm wrong somewhere. This is all still early in development and there isn't really one true definition of how to implement it yet. There are working programs but I don't believe consensus is formed on one way to achieve second layer networks like lightning​

And in case that's hard to read, [maybe this will be easier to read](
@_date: 2019-05-01 11:01:32
Yeah, they obviously weren't listening to the video. They also have horrible quoting abilities. The say something about a $4 million limit, but Andreas says "...when it gets close to the payment limit, which is 4 million satoshis, ..."
This is really bad reporting...
[Here's the video](
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:38:35
Which three?
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:05:05
Yup! If you want, you could also set up "budget" channels like groceries and leisure for the month/year since you would be limited by the amount you put in. This would, of course, increase the load on the blockchain, but it's a cool idea
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:34:33
Is that how long it took to appear in your wallet, or how long it took to confirm? If the latter, then he could have used a small fee, as it wasn't a critical transaction
