No they aren't?
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:08:14
Hardly. If I was the 1%... Sure, it'd make me poorer. But I'm already poor.
I'm a democratic socialist. The things I want will benefit everyone. Social programs are a ride that lifts all ships.
@_date: 2019-07-18 09:56:02
Not yet.
@_date: 2019-07-02 01:38:41
Yes, because he's going after a dictatorship and using it to attack democratic socialism. It's disingenuous.
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:49:49
Just today a *government entity* handed me $30 in untraceable cash and told me *not to tell the feds!*
This was *inside a courthouse*!
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:29:01
Except of course in Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Canada... But no, SoCIaLisM.
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:10:37
It's disingenuous to call Venezuela socialist.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:02:55
Yeah who said it was free?
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:12:31
No, people need to sell at 9k so my buys can hit...
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:49:11
Yep, that's why the Disney heirs are begging for higher taxes. That's why they all fled and America collapsed after FDR.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:42:58
I mean, I can't really state it more clearly than 'you are wrong'. Not only will we not collapse, we'll be stronger. Even the rich would be better off.
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:06:39
If it's priced in btc... It costs the same amount of btc no matter what the USD does.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:27:32
I'm not selfish. I pay taxes. I don't resent them. I get zero government aid. 
Yes I do.
My child goes to public school. I drive on public roads. I'm protected by a fire department and a police force. My country has military. 
And if something did go horribly wrong for me I have a safety net so my kid doesn't just... Starve.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:29:53
The answer there is wealth tax.
I don't think you understand - I'm talking about radical changes. Everything is on the table. There is no existing tax law or loophole we can't change.
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:07:34
It went up 6% yesterday
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:18:49
Nope. Ubi will come coupled with massive unemployment, which will already have driven wages down - it will not be a catalyst for change; it will be the response to the changes wrought by a post scarcity society

Bitcoin has the advantage over fiat in this case in that there is a finite supply. It's not even about printing more - most $ in circulation is just numbers in an account. There's an infinite supply of fiat. As the amount approaches infinity, value approaches zero.
Now, Bitcoin - the amount cannot grow without investing fiat. That's where the current value really comes from. Once mining is complete, however, the amount in circulation can only shrink.
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:35:04
Appears to be better than yours.
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:41:45
@_date: 2019-03-31 03:36:08
Unlikely. Highly unlikely. Inflation requires there to be more money. It's basically a measure of how much money is added to the economy.
Bitcoin has a hard limit.
@_date: 2019-03-14 22:53:38
But are they writing novels? 
It will be a sad future full of mindless consumers, right until the robots figure out they don't need us.
@_date: 2019-03-31 14:36:14
The only thing I expect to beat the market long term is Bitcoin.
401k beats it now because of fees, taxes, and agency matching. That's really all I'm saying.
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:09:16
This only works if we also slash working hours. 20 hour work weeks or less.
There's just not enough work to go around otherwise.
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:28:00
I'm for Ubi, but just to bite:
Write novels. 
The creative arts will be the last thing the robots take.
@_date: 2019-03-31 14:13:58
Match, yes. Outperform, no.
@_date: 2019-03-14 23:03:32
Thing is, there's a huge gulf between generating news articles and writing a novel - here I'm assuming we want the novel to be compelling, character driven, with a coherent plot and lots of emotion. Aka good. It's not right around the corner unless we hit the singularity. By time ai can do that, the robots will be over throwing us.
The reason why is in the article you linked - a neural network can spit out an approximation of Jane Austen's writing style, but is still light years away from understanding why Darcy made that huffing noise, was it something I said??
@_date: 2019-03-31 03:29:18
I did some math and discovered no investment beats my 401k in performance. I can get the same rate in stocks and funds outside it, but then I pay fees. It's really shocking to realize the best strategy is to fund the 401k more and let my savings account dwindle.
Bitcoin, meanwhile, I'm still down. Sucks.
@_date: 2019-10-26 14:48:54
Price ticker.
@_date: 2019-10-26 04:21:26
Well someone bought some coin at a price of 41k a coin today. Probably not very much but it happened right before the spike.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:53:31
It takes about 14 seconds... 
Wtf... Where did you get 14 days?
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:44:11
What I'm doing. And we'll get downvoted for admitting to selling.
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:22:19
Do any of them? And does it matter if you just want returns?
@_date: 2019-02-20 23:59:21
Trade embargo was lifted...
@_date: 2019-02-18 05:05:34
Bitcoin rewards *both* the firstcomers and the laggards. The increasing price relative fiat appears to punish them, but the deflationary nature of Bitcoin means that however much they can exchange their fiat for will eventually grow.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:37:28
Bought at 3.5k... bought at 4k... Bought at 5k... Etc...
@_date: 2019-02-10 11:38:14
How do I protect my coin against hardware failure, theft, my own stupidity, my death, etc?
My USD is protected by a massively redundant banking network and I can recover access by proving who I am if I happen to forget the password / etc, and already has a system for my survivors to inherit.
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:42:12
You can sell on coinbase instantly. It's just a pita to get usd back out.
Still... Don't use coinbase, and only put the coin you intend to sell into an exchange.
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:28:36
Are they going to look under everyone's mattress?
@_date: 2019-08-24 22:21:19
Yes. Because I'm hungry now. If I wait a year I will starve.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:49:58
Robinhood is selling you Bitcoin like it's stock. They own some amount of Bitcoin and you're able to buy or sell shares of it. At no point is there ever an actual transaction on the block chain. I don't believe they actually own enough coin to cover what they 'sell' - probably doing fractional reserve with it. But it does have the advantage of no fees and instant transactions.
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:11:12
Robinhood also does not buy a thing for you. They have a reserve and sell you 'shares' of their Bitcoin. They don't even need to actually have the coin, at any point, they just need the equivalent value in fiat when you cash out.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:43:56
It's not a government monopoly. It's the way it is because the government subsidized it, then didn't take control.
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:07:23
Not quit my job because I still won't be rich
@_date: 2019-06-06 10:40:40
When you finish send it here and I'll check the 0.75 Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:46:09
Please do.
@_date: 2019-02-10 11:38:59
Why wouldn't I use an exchange like coinbase?
Also wouldn't many, many miners have to modify it in exactly the same way? And couldn't they still do that even if my node disagreed?
@_date: 2019-02-12 12:25:16
I don't get it. Wouldn't negative inflation just be deflation?
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:00:10
Diversification is the answer. 
You're either in bitcoin to use it as a currency or as an investment. Lets not lie; most people are in it as an investment. If so, not only have you diversified storage, bitcoin isn't your only investment, right?
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:42:19
Buy now. Buy later too.
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:20:39
Coinbase absolutely does not have to find a matching offer. Coinbase has a stockpile of coin; when you buy, they just agree that some is yours.
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:11:54
I'm just in it for wealth preservation. Tell me why I should take on that expense.
Edit: pretend I know nothing. Really sell this to me.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:38:03
Goes down, buy the dip. 
Goes up, okay.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:36:34
Volatile gonna volatile.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:39:59
Oh God I wish. I'd buy that dip so hard.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:00:35
For $7? No. They cost at least twice that.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:02:38
I mean I have limit sells set all the way up... So honestly a peak like that then a crash and another 18 month climb would really help future me out.
@_date: 2019-10-07 02:10:27
Why the fuck would they sell it all?
They convert what they need to the local currency to maintain their lifestyle, and they've been doing it for years.
@_date: 2019-02-22 17:48:28
Hmm. Win-win. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 05:17:44
The advantage will be the preservation of wealth. If the USD tanks converting Bitcoin to it would be silly, but I'd still be rich in euros or pounds or something.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:37:17
Always buy.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:54:31
Correct. Gotta keep some where it's easy to convert.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:07:44
Much more. Also a lot of places just... Wouldn't get roads.
And good luck making your own road. You want to cross mine? No, only I serve that entire city. I can do this because nobody can cross my land.
Roads are a utility and utilities only work if they are government run. If you want an example of private run utilities, look at cable companies. Is that how you want everything to work?
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:48:15
Pointless. 
How much coin is owned by individuals, but aggregated in exchange wallets?
How many whales have multiple wallets?
@_date: 2019-02-15 02:08:11
The reason they don't is because it's pretty trivial to scam a cash back rewards card if they did.
Say... Buy $1000 in BTC, get 2% back ($20, not bad!), Cash out BTC, buy $1020 in BTC... rinse and repeat. You just need to have enough startup cash to make a profit after fees.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:51:05
You can't transfer to your own wallet. Don't worry, you can get your money out; you just have to sell first. They treat it like stock.
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:06:53
Not arbitrary... 99 would be more so in the computing world. We use nice round numbers like 8 and 512.
@_date: 2019-12-28 18:16:44
1. Use gift card for everyday expenses.
2. Use the money that you would have spent on those things for Bitcoin.
Money is fungible... So why is this an issue?
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:42:52
Yeah that's why I'm advocating for not blending it...
@_date: 2019-02-12 15:11:19
This argument always strikes me as stupid.
1 USD also = 1 USD.
@_date: 2019-02-21 11:42:33
It's unenforceable. It's to discourage people from using a currency the government can't control. They'll tack it on when they discover it after arresting you for something else.
@_date: 2019-01-11 19:33:23
No, the price in Satoshi will be the same.
@_date: 2019-01-06 17:56:38
This prompted me to check and I'm still down SMH
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:45:12
If it's going to the Moon why am I still down?
