There are some coins that might be better than Bitcoin for specific reasons and use cases, and they are not trying to be Bitcoin. BCH and the other forks are another thing, and they ultimately don't improve much (if at all) to the original.

Strange enough, it's higher tham a few months ago, compared to Euro or Dollar. Although "my" government is the most crooked you can find in Europe. I am sure it's all some big plan so the politicians can make lots of profit for a few months. 
As for the dollar, it's the de facto example that FIAT should be withdrawn, or at least, should be managed by transparent, open source software. Wealth inequality is the main reason why wars, oppression, racism, sexism, religion, extremism, nationalism and so on, still exist

Read the theories, don't watch the news. Communism, Democracy, Anarchism, these are all utopias. They can be achieved in a small community living isolated from the general population, but nothing more than that. 
Indeed, they have never been achieved in the world before. All the communist leaders were just autocratic totalitarian assholes, all the democratic politicians are corrupted, greedy pigs, and anarchy has been insulted since forever by such politicians, to a point where the number of people that truly believe in Anarchic ideals are a staggering minority compared to any other political theory/system.

I understand your point. But here in Europe festivals are seen differently than in North America. In the USA, Burning Man might be the only good "festival" that can be considered a "tribal gathering". Ozora, BOOM, MoDem and many other festivals in Europe are also considered Tribal Gatherings. Not just because they are based on Psychedelic and Goa Trance, but also for the other activities being held there. 
Ozora is most known in the world for sure, they have evolved from a little open air party, to one of the biggest festivals in Europe. The [2014 after movie]( is my favorite.
As for the EDM scene, where young kids chaotically drink until passing out, or take pills and unknown substances, only to find themselves in the ER, nope, we don't really have such a thing in Europe. David Guetta and the other clowns play at Tomorrowland and a couple of other festivals, but these are still frequented by adults, or wise kids at least....

During those times, I first came to know about Bitcoin. To me, it was a way to purchase GBL and substances on the dark web, and I never read much about it. I might have moved about 3 Bitcoins around the internet, all purchased at an average price of $500. 
Last year I really got into it, for the tech and for it's political-financial-social vision. Looking at my hot wallet history on Blockchain.info, I really hated myself for not getting into it, for having fear and hesitation because of my ignorance. At the time I had money, and if I had purchased at least 1BTC, I'd be out of my actual financial difficulties...

It's a democratic, communist, anarchic system, where people are meant to love and respect each other. It's the best we can achieve, in theory. But to achieve a gifting economy, we need to spend and collect supplies before the festival. If Burning Man was a community, that always works this way, it might be considered a successful gifting economy. 
A system where everybody has his own role, where each and everyone of us has a job that is meant to aid and support the entire community. Think of The Smurfs, their system is the best ever. Each smurf has his own job and role, the cook, the gardener, the barber, the painter, the musician, the elder and so on. They don't have money, they don't need it. The produce and grow everything they need, they share everything with each other, and if they ever need something that is not found in their territory, they exchange their produce for such a thing, or sell it, so they can buy what they need. 
Have you ever watched The Beach by Danny Boyle (2000)? They are isolated and happy, every now and then, they travel to the city, sell the marijuana they grow to buy rice, batteries, supplies and so on. 
Money has changed us into heartless monsters. We kill and destroy for wealth and power. Everything wrong with the world today, has been brought by egoism, pride and lack of compassion. Traits that have only worsened by the introduction of FIAT!!

Binance doesn't rip you off. They don't care about your "change". You can't imagine the profit they are making. 
They make mistakes, they might have a problematic system...but they are not trying to rip you off, believe me. Just stay away from HitBTC, Changelly, CoinTelegraph, CoinMarketCap, etc..These companies have all been founded by the "creators" of Bytecoin. Which is the biggest scam (premine) in the history of crypto. 
As for Coinbase, they are not scammers, but I don't trust them one bit. I am glad you can complain to your beloved government if someone scams you. You should really trust the United States government, especially considering how well they are managing the dollar. :)

Well, I agree on most of what you said. 
For whoever misunderstands my replies, I am not conning or deceiving anyone. I am just a broken person in a horrible social/family situation. My monthly salary is between $180 and $220, and my $400 worth of crypto are a desperate attempt to achieve financial freedom and run away from this boring life, from this loser country and from my "difficult" parents. I am 23 years old, and I have already pressed pause..or better say, others have pressed it for me. 
I might be extremist in some of my ideals, but I like trusting people, even if I end up betrayed, cheated on, abused or broken. 
This is not my attempt to make you feel pity, it's the need for auto correction. I really liked what you said about my judging, and it made me think. 
Conclusively, I'd like to add that we live in a individualistic and egoistical world. No one can be trusted, every one lies, we are all assholes. But I truly believe that love exists and universal respect and dignity can be achieved. No matter how cynical I might seem or I try to be, I'm a lover, and I will die lonely, just like each and every one of us.

Just for info, he has no age to keep taking cocaine or other stimulants. He is using opiates. I have analyzed about a dozen interviews and I can claim quite strongly that he is using some Opiate or Opioid. It's the only kind of substance that can give him advantages at his old age without no health problems. If he never remains without and never crosses the line of abuse he's as productive as a 40 year old. Although I don't understand why so many people from the crypto world are insulting psychoactive substances, we have anarchy at the core of our ideology, and we should not look at psychoactives with such prejudice and ignorance. Don't forget that dark web markets were the kickstarters of crypto as currency.

Bitcoin and cryptos in general will get adopted more and more, sooner than later. And more and more people will learn about the disadvantages of FIAT, inflation, centralization, deception by governments and banks!!! Soon enough FIAT will be worth less and less every day for the next 10-20 years until it will finally crash. 
TL;DR Crypto currencies are so great we won't need FIAT in the future, and they will be worth not more than toilet paper. :) 
@_date: 2018-05-03 21:49:59
It will be worth 10-15 Eth. It will be worth 30-35 Monero. It will be worth 50-60 LTC. 
Why do you think BTC's value is dependent to the value of USD? 
We use FIAT to buy crypto, but that doesn't mean that FIAT rules crypto. Probably even tether will be around when FIAT and traditional markets start crashing :P

The trick is stopping to think in dollars or euros ;) At least for the money you have invested or traded.

Soon enough, surely crypto will not be the sole form of payment.

It's so obvious that you're a 30-40 year old American man. Why? 
I don't really work for an employer. I work for my father, and help him make fresh pasta and raviolis. I earn about $100 a month since restaurants are not ordering much product this last year. But that's not a problem since I still live with my parents. The world doesn't really work like America does. I'm a 23 year old, with lots of family issues, been forced to do (or not to do) things the last year or so and it has been terrible...
I guess you can find advantages and positives in any negative thing, any disgrace, any scandal. I hope you enjoy your house!
I was judging those over 40 because most of them are obtuse people, afraid of what they don't know and don't understand. Not that they want to. People nowadays are allergic to information, those of my age more than your's, but at least we are open minded. And just to be clear I am not defending teenagers and youngsters. Most of them listen to shitty commercial music, watch blockbusters, and never read books. But I can't bear the ignorant arrogance of the middle aged. 
I don't understand how you can copy bitcoin, but if I understood correctly what you are expressing here, I guess you should be following and praising some traditional investment subreddit, the mighty real estate market. Go go Warren Buffet. 
And as for alternatives I have been saying it for a lot of time now. Bitcoin gave the start, but it doesn't have anything special considering most other coins. I personally am a very passionate fan of Monero, but I am confident there are other good coins, even some good tokens. 
But just to be clear, Bitcoin can be divided up to 8 digits (called satoshis), yet most uneducated traders will surely think bitcoin is too expensive. They are nice for bubbles, we can profit a lot from the public participation that buys high and sells low. But in the long run, almost everyone of us wants that breed gone, we want educated people that aim for the adoption of crypto, not just speculation and the "let's get rich and buy a lambo". Of course I'm trading, and profiting as much as I can, why wouldn't I do it? It might give me some financial freedom and finally leave this damn shithole of a country. Study somewhere in northern Europe. Create and maintain my own life. I suggest you do the same. Take care and don't work your ass off. Studies and reforms have clearly shown that the less you work (or study) the more productive you are, just take a look at what Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Norway are doing, while Holland, Belgium and Germany are catching on ;)

I don't see any value in gold, silver, platinum...not even diamonds, rubies etc. They are metals, minerals. They are scarce and they look nice, but nothing useful about them. I have never ever purchased expensive jewelry, I enjoy more my hand made colorful bracelets, or carved wood fungi necklace, or my simple stainless steel blue ring purchased on ebay for about $2.
Anything is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. When it's useful, most want it. If it's just a gimmick, something "nice" and "scarce" only desperate lonely housewives and immature young girls would want it. I'm sorry if I'm being harsh to a specific stereotype. But I personally see people developing intelligence and knowledge, emancipating, growing up and out of the dogmas we have praised for hundreds of years. 
I don't see gold or other precious metals and minerals raising in value, actually just diminishing, until they can only be used for electrical wires, computer parts, glass cutting tools etc.

Wikipedia: In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy.
So, consider this 3 arguments: 
Bitcoin has a fixed max supply known to everyone, 21million.
Bitcoin's production is being halved every 4 years. 
Bitcoin's popularity is raising everyday, almost anyone under the age of 40, that passes enough time on the internet has heard of BTC, and most of them will get on the boat by the next bubble.
Take a guess what's going to happen with crypto while the years pass.

You want to contribute to society? Go help the poor, the old, the children, and the animals that suffer every minute of every day on this damned planet. No sane person wants to work 9-5 (or 8-4 in my country) for some arrogant employer or a big evil corporation. If you were an entrepreneur, you had your own product/company and wanted to see it become popular and used by the masses, that's worth the hassle of a 9-5 or even 16hours of work a day. If you were an artist, that'd be worth it, if I had the talent I'd constantly write music, paint, sculpt, create and so on. Too bad for me I live in an ignorant country full of judgemental people, I study film making and teachers give us things to film. At the first attempt to create something that can be labeled as art, feelings, emotions, experience, they oppose us and won't let us go on. They are trying to teach us the most basic actions and visual clues a film maker should learn, while forgetting that without creativity this passion/profession cannot succeed!!

Ethereum was perfect for scammers and companies looking to make a quick buck without having to respect funding regulations. The guys from Cryptokitties became crazy rich selling stupid photos (and code) of cats before replicating the same cat or even "improving" it for a higher price. 
The only application I see smart contracts as useful is escrow; We can't keep trusting those third parties...maybe some other use too, but I can't think of another one now. 
I should mention a nice story I read on Discord months ago. This guy was claiming that one user posted the private keys of his ETH wallet on Twitter, Discord, Telegram etc. He had a good amount of tokens there but no gas to transfer them. Hundreds of people sent some ETH to that address in the hope of being able to get the tokens for themselves. A smart contract written by the "scammer", transferred all the ETH being received to another wallet he owned. Little by little, he made some crazy gains...if the story is true. 
In such a case, I must worship the guy. It's not even scamming xD 
All those people tried to steal his funds but he was able to fuck them all. Simple, but genius!
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:44:41
I concur. But we're still in it's infancy, and it's wrong to expect perfect results now. 
Ultimately, everything in the space exists for profit and even the guys that love the technology behind it are lying to themselves. They wouldn't be so enthusiastic if they had lost 100% of what they invested, even if Bitcoin was perfect. If people truly love Bitcoin for what it is and what it was created for, there wouldn't be services and people trying to sell you crypto for a 20-30% interest fee.

I don't live in the US, and most of the world's population doesn't as well. 
I live in a small country in Southern Europe. Coinbase, BitPanda, BL3P, Kraken and almost all other exchanges don't accept users from my country. Some others only accept bank deposits (which cost around $30). There are no Bitcoin ATMs in my country but even if there were, it'd be too expensive. There are 3 sellers on LocalBitcoin but they ask for a 12% - 15% fee, too expensive as well. 
EDIT: We created a currency that could destroy banks and finally redistribute wealth. Be used by everyone on every corner of the world, almost for free. Unfortunately, 10 years later we still can't buy the damned currency!!! 
The only exchange I can buy crypto from is Cex.io by using a credit card. I pay 3% fee for every deposit and about 4% for withdrawals (but haven't withdrawn anything and probably won't for some other years). 
I didn't know Binance finally started accepting FIAT deposits. It's the exchange I used for altcoin trading until they kicked me out!!! They mentioned warnings released by a few international organizations on Money Laundering and Terrorism Funding. I checked and those organizations hadn't mentioned my country since the 90' (Balkan wars). After opening 4-5 support tickets and receiving pre-written bot replies, they said there was no way they could continue offering me their services and I should withdraw my funds before something happens...
My country is wrongly portrayed as having a Muslim majority. After 60 years of pseudo-communism that destroyed almost all churches and mosques, my country is 70% atheist or agnostic. Some estimates say there might be more Christian Orthodox than Muslims. After some reddit posts I discovered people from Turkey and Middle East were kicked out as well. I verified myself with my Italian passport, I have a Catholic name and seems illogical for them to assume I could fund terrorists or be one myself. And if they thought I was laundering money, my entire crypto capital was a little over $700, which was accumulated $100 at a time during 9 months or so...
I could sign up again and start using a VPN, but I don't want to have my miserable capital seized for cheating their system. 
They did the same thing Youtube did: They welcomed every kind of video until creators emerged and viewers only increased before cleaning up everything. Binance said it would be open to everyone, no matter the country, language, ethnicity, religion and so on, but they cleaned up everything after becoming the first exchange by volume and gaining enough attention and media coverage. Uggghhh!

Bittrex International doesn't accept credit cards. It costs 30-50Euros to send bank transfers from my country. 


Paxful seems interesting. Unfortunately, the lowest fee I'll have to pay to buy crypto is 18% (9% to the seller and 7% Western Union). Or send a bank transfer and only pay 3% to the seller :P 
I might use Bitify in the future. I have some old video games I might sell, probably some other stuff around the house. But shipping packages from my country is expensive, probably as expensive as shipping them from the US to Europe (Last time, I wanted to buy a pair of bike pedals for $18; Amazon asked $70 for shipping) 
Amazon is a scam anyway, but even American eBay sellers ask between 80% - 500% of the product's cost to ship... 
I really appreciate your time and effort. Thanks for your input but there's not much choice for us apparently. I've talked to many exchanges and asked them if they're ever going to offer their services to people that reside in smaller and poorer countries like mine. I have some hope in BitPanda and BL3P. Maybe I can convince one of my relatives to verify their phone number on BitPanda (must be EU number) and allow me to buy crypto for a smaller fee; Or I'll probably just move to an EU country in about 2 years (Masters degree) and buy crypto seamlessly...
Take care mate :)

I have relatives abroad but they don't have much knowledge about Bitcoin; Most of them consider it a pyramidal scheme...and I'd spend at least 7% fee to send them 100-200 Euros through Western Union. Even if they accepted, I'm sure they'd fuck up and lose the coins...
Well, I'm sure all of us trade a little...be it for fun or for profit. In my case, I'd lose to much money moving the crypto from wallet to exchange so I just keep the amount I trade on Kraken....

Considering how many choices are out there to buy crypto, and how expensive they are, their fee seems concurrent to LocalBTC and other buy/sell services. For most of the world, Coinbase and most other exchanges are not accessible...
Fortunately for me, there is one exchange willing to take credit cards and only asks for a 3% deposit fee (Cex.io) I really wish Bitpanda, BL3P and others didn't discriminate based on location...

It's legal in Albania and just restricted in Macedonia.
Albania's PM is very open to new opportunities and is urging the central bank to start thinking laws on accepting crypto. We can invest, we can trade, we can give to each other, but legally, merchants are not allowed to take BTC for goods and services. This has little to do with crypto itself, we have huge problems in the economical sector and people still sell in their stores, bars, restaurants without giving the proper check. All this is done to pay less taxes, and I understand them because the government and central bank are incredibly crooked...there is no future here for small business owners...

This friend verified the Blockchain account and got some free XLM. Turned it into BTC and wanted to give me what he owed. We didn't really have a choice on wallets and RBF. He was sending me screenshots and I was telling him what to do to send the transaction and pay low fees. 
I checked a few websites on fee estimation and they said that 2-3 sat/byte would get confirmed in maximum 720minutes. I went with 5 sats to be sure. 
Blockchain.info was suggesting 90 sats/byte and an estimation of $1.6 for a $24 transaction. That's what angered me the most. 
Thanks for your input, it was very educating. I look more into the links you posted.

For going off topic or liking another coin more than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-25 00:10:09
XMR.TO ? Strange, I live in the poorest hellhole in Europe and it's available for me. 
I believe a couple of countries have "banned" or restricted the use of privacy coins (France if I'm not mistaken), thus XMR.TO doesn't want to take risks and endanger the social and political freedom of people. It can be accessed with TOR or a VPN though, and both XMR.TO and the Monero community advice the use of TOR for any conversion and transaction. 
MorphToken is also regarded as a good service by the Monero community, I've encountered no complains whatsoever about it. I use XMR.TO because it's implemented directly in Monerujo (Android wallet). 
I thought Altcoins couldn't be mentioned in posts, apparently, even replies adhere to this rule. What if I want to make a comparison between Bitcoin and another coin, is that permitted? 
This rule applies to most subreddits, but people constantly mention other coins, just for reference, comparison, example and so on...
@_date: 2019-04-24 23:20:57
Well, I understand your frustration. 
Awareness doesn't count much considering where we're from and how our lives progress. Not to mention the fact that multiple entities (except for the government) already have our identities, there's not much they can do with the ID Personal Number. I have personally verified my identity on Binance and Kraken, not to mention all the personal information I've given to Google, Facebook and other internet corporations when I was still a teenager. 
$25 are a lot when you're a student and the average monthly wage in your country is $250. You can buy over 10 packs of cigarettes with $25 or eat for 4-5 days. It's a huge difference from the economic reality of the US and EU. 
I checked a couple of sites on fee estimation and they both stated that 2-3 sat/byte would be confirmed in max. 720minutes, but I told him to set 5 sats just to be sure. Maybe I should have consulted more reputable sources...
So, do you confirm me that Blockchain has nothing to do with big transactions, transaction fees and weight units? Seems hard to believe that they don't redirect transactions made with their wallet towards their own miners and partners. How do they make money, just with the (new) Swap feature? My friend spent $2 to convert $26 of XLM into BTC.
EDIT: Thanks for elaborating and explaining what bugged you. I don't think it's laziness the main reason why people like me and many others are not very familiar with BTC transactions and more in depth features; some of us revere and use other coins or perhaps our minds are not sharp enough to understand such "complications". I personally have the bad habit of dedicating myself to multiple things at once. I often mix school, leisure, crypto, TA, Youtube videos and Wikipedia articles on multiple fields and subjects etc, and I always end up frustrated, confused, with a wide array of responsibilities and no desire to take care of them...

Paypal is used mainly for online purchases, and it's always the vendor who pays their fees. Something similar happens with vendors and websites that offer a substantial discount when you pay with crypto, albeit way better than similar. I suppose we need to find a way to make escrow peer to peer, without the need of complicated dApps. Lots of people don't use crypto to buy goods and services because there is a high chance of getting scammed by the seller, while with Paypal it's the opposite. A vendor can accept a few chargebacks a month if his sales went great, but a buyer will become scared and skeptical of any novelty after being scammed just once. What appeared to be crypto's strong suit (trust), has revealed to be it's greatest enemy towards adoption. We are skeptical and cynical by nature, and we'll have to balance those traits with technology. I went off topic, sorry.
I see Bitcoin more as a store of value and investment; a specific coin cannot be considered a currency if it does not guarantee the basic features of cash; fungibility and anonymity...that's my opinion at least. Some people say that LN will finally solve the lack of privacy one encounters with Bitcoin, but I still think that's too far in the future.
I think you might have guessed which is my favourite coin by now.

Those are surely not all the possible mnemonic words. My old Blockchain.info wallet has some words that are not there. 
While you can choose your own words (Ledger Nano),  I'd set words in my native language (Albanian) or even use Esperanto or Interlingua. I've got imagination, and I bet nobody would ever be able to find what words I thought of, if it were a friend of mine he would be able to guess 2-3 maximum.

Everyone at says that the patch is a Hacktool indeed. But it hacks the Adobe products and does nothing to you, your network, passwords etc. It sounds right, but you can never be too sure. 
This is why many AVs flag it as such, while having contracts with most big software publishers that stipulate the flagging of patches, cracks, keygen etc. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:59:57
Yeah, I will when I can afford one. And I haven't used the patch yet. Probably will not. Is this true about replacing addresses, is this only about the Ledger or the Trezor and Keepkay are spoiled too ?

I've had other (less serious) issues with Binance and I've posted multiple timeson the sub to call them out and get at least an explanation.

It was going to happen, haven't you noticed the symmetry in the charts? It's been going on since the fall in December-January. For every red candle there is a green one that returns the price back at baseline. Sometimes it takes hours from the red to the green and vice versa, other times it might take weeks. It's the whales trading and longing/shorting at the same time. Probably Bitfinex, OKEX and BitMex. Most people go short, and they paint a long green candle, then people go long and they close the symmetry with a red one, liquidating every motherfucker that went to trade without any knowledge, preferably with +20x margin...

You should consider many alts have features bitcoin only dreamt about. Being the first, BTC will never die and it will lead the red carpet for all the other coins. But if you consider Monero, Ethereum, Neo, Filecoin, Siacoin and Civic you might notice that there are many alts that have the potential to overpower Bitcoin with their uses and features. It will obviously not happen, but they will follow it behind as if BTC imprinted them ;) 
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:09:58
You surely are a maximalist. Monero has a dev team which has been devoted to the project, many developers come and go but fluffypony and the other guys will always stay. I have been impressed how devoted they are to the community itself, they continually ask for feedback. And I have never seen wars and trolls and assholes roaming the subreddit between users like I have seen here. I would say that Bitcoin has surely hardforked more than Monero. That is about to change as we have chosen to hardfork every 6 months to preserve the ASIC resistance. The confusion you have about Monero is because of 3-4 groups of people which have chosen to back Bitmain and/or have already purchased many X3 ASICs and have created 3 different Monero versions that will be based on the old chain. Which of them is the true one I don't really care because I stick to the real Monero. Just as you guys stick to the real Bitcoin. I am not saying that Monero is better than Bitcoin, or the opposite. Because every coin is different, and has it's unique features. It's like comparing a car with a bicycle, each has it's advantages in different situations. I personally have a bicycle and it is perfect in traffic-riddled city :D But I guess we diverted from the original argument :P Anyway I wish you and Bitcoin the best :)

Dude, these people are nuts. I can't endure the way they think about god, jesus and the bible. I personally am 100% against religions, but am not in anyway against faith, spirituality, introspection, meditation, astral projection, lucid dreaming, psychedelic substances. I believe in Love, Peace, Respect, Honesty, Unity, Generosity as our pillar virtues and probably Gods. Science is a perfect tool to describe the physical, thermal, electrical, gravitational, dimensional, kinetic etc. aspects of our world. But since it is not able to explain dreams, life after death, the Soul, Love, Ego Death (the psychedelic effects of hallucinogenic substances like LSD, Psilocybin, DMT, Mescaline, LSA, Ibogaine, Salvia etc), astral worlds and entities..I am not atheist. Mainly because I have witnessed and felt magic I would have never even dreamed of. But the way these people are connecting in a stupid and irrational way god with AI, bitcoin, dark matter, ghosts, corporations etc is totally another level of mental illness :( 
@_date: 2018-04-21 17:27:44
Wallets don't discriminate (except for Coinbase). Blockchain.info is the best and fastest way to create a wallet and receive BTC. But being a hot wallet I would not recommend for large sums. Use Electrum or  Exodus. Software wallets with best trust and reviews. Armour is also good I've heard. But if you want to get into the space, invest, trade and have a future in crypto. Get a Ledger or Trezor ($75 abd $100 respectively)

Yep sure, i knew this would happen. If I also get banned from the sub, I might truly believe what they say. Anyway I love bitcoin and always will, but just the amount of centralization and instability that was found in our network lately can nullify your statement. Every coin has problems and each tries to solve them. Only when bitcoin will be completely community driven like Monero and some others, bitcoin might triumph again as the coin that it should have been. Ethereum should do the same, but hey nobody is perfect right?  :)

It was created to eliminate third parties and completely annihilate the role of banks in society. 10 years later, you can't buy Bitcoin without a bank account or credit card...

I don't use Google.
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:27:48
True, but LocalBitcoin sellers can only be found in western countries and large metropolitan areas. Many people in Asia and Africa would have to travel for hundreds or thousands of kilometers to buy crypto, and they'd surely spend more on petrol.
ATMs are the same. e.g There are no ATMs whatsoever in my country; some guys wanted to install one a few months ago but it wasn't working correctly and then the government forced them to uninstall it after a week. Not to mention the crazy fees you have to pay with ATMs (10% - 15%)...and even some LocalBitcoin sellers are sly, they know you can't find crypto anywhere else and ask for a crazy percentage. 
Even if you have a bank account or credit card, the transfer and depositing fees are exorbitant. I can buy crypto from one exchange only and I pay a 3% fee for credit card depositing. People in Africa and Asia are less fortunate and are forced to use CoinMama or some other shady website.
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:18:22
And what can I use? Binance is the only one that supports the coins that I am interested in, that supports my country (or supported) and is big enough to be fast and reliable.

Let me rephrase: I don't really trust myself with decentralized exchanges. I've installed Waves, but never used because of the concerns I've read. I have also tried Bisq while searching a good way to deposit FIAT and convert it to crypto, but I ended up uninstalling it because I could only deposit with SEPA, and my country is not in SEPA. 
I am enough tech savvy to fix simple problems in my computer, or learn to use any software I've ever encountered. But with DEXes, it seems to me like I might lose everything if I click something wrong. 
I don't know, I'm really scared of them. Not being a programmer, and not being able to understand the most complex functions of cryptocurrencies, I prefer resorting to a third party for trading.
Even wallets are scary to me. I'm a big Monero fan but the wallet is too difficult for me, or rather complicated. I understand that a privacy coin has additional features to guarantee safety, but it's a field I am not really able on...

They are hard to find, and you never get good quality locally. The dealer is always an ignorant guy that has no idea what LSD is, how it should be kept and all the consequences. 
He probably keeps 20 blotters in his sweaty pocket during the summer, or inside his phone's case. But LSD will degrade because of light, heat, salt, chlorine and lots of other circumstances. There are less complications for MDMA, Mushrooms, Mescaline, 2CB and other substances in the psychedelic and entactogen categories, but still, they don't really care about specialty drugs that don't cause addiction. 
Dealers prefer straightforward drugs, that will bring regular clients, and don't cause long trips and psychedelic effects. That is why 90% of all the dealers will choose one or more of these three substances: Marijuana, Cocaine, Heroin. Nowadays you'll also find lots of guys selling prescription opiates (Hydrocodone), benzodiazepines (Xanax) and Speed (Amphetamine). These are the street dealers and also the most successful ones. I don't know much about the US, but from films and news, I know Methamphetamine is the fourth drug, sold as frequently as the three originals. 
Club dealers often work for the club owner, or give him and his bodyguards a cut. They mainly sell Ecstasy/MDMA, Speed, Ketamine, GHB, N2O and also some specialty Phenetylamines (2C-x, Nbomes, Mescaline etc.)
Anyway, psychedelics are the most researched and sold psychoactive substances nowadays (online). Not to mention all the tech guys that started microdosing these last years. Their only source: darknet markets. 
Addicts don't buy drugs on the internet. Even if they could wait, and had the money upfront, they wouldn't go through the hassle of learning how to access the deepweb, use cryptocurrencies, VPN, private PO box and so on and so forth. 
Darknet markets were primarily used by curious youngsters, psychonauts, psychologists/psychiatrists and such. Maybe a group of swaggers buying some pills for a big concert. 
And another big percentage were the dealers. It's way more safe buying large quantities of drugs online, than meeting up with the friend of a friend in a dark alley at night. Chances to get arrested or mugged are too high. Those that know the internet, and are smart and dedicated enough to learn anonymity and crypto: They use these markets. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:13:52
Agreed!They started large and waited to garner lots of users, from any country. They started investing in poor countries, even opening their first Fiat exchange in Uganda, only able to work with Ugandan Shillings. Now, they are banning countries that "have sanctions" from the OFAC, but it's not true. 
According to OFAC and other similar global organizations, the Balkans are a delicate region in regards to society and economy, and companies should be careful when dealing in these regions. But this statement has been released since the beginning of the 2000', not a few weeks ago. 
I am confident that their main concern is "terrorism", or better say Islam. My country's religions are frequently advertised this way: 70% Muslim, 20% Orthodox and 10% Catholic. It's not true! 
If we only count dedicated religious people, there are more Orthodox people in Albania than Muslim. After about 55 years of "communism", when most churches and mosques were destroyed or converted to "cultural buildings", 60% - 70% of people in Albania are atheist or agnostic. They state Islam as their religion just because their grandparents were Muslim, but they've never been to a mosque and regularly drink alcohol and eat pork. 
Nonetheless, Christians and Muslims coexist peacefully in Albania. There have never been riots or protests or civil wars about religion. There has never been a murder, or assault about religion in Albania. 
[Here you have multiple photos of the religious leaders of Albania, all together, smiling and attending events together](
Albania actually gloats internationally about it's religious tolerance and coexistence, and it's all true...

I'm sorry for being closed minded. I didn't say there's no addict whatsoever that uses darknet to buy his medicine, I was just talking about the majority of them. My reasons to believe so were pretty convincing, but I didn't mean to offend or discredit anyone. I've had my own addictions in the past, and I can imagine your situation. 
I bet though, you buy your stuff locally when shipping is delayed, or the items get lost and so on.
