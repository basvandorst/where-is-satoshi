Once submitting a request, there are three possible outcomes.
1)  Fincen could say "Yes, we seized the coins."
2)  Fincen could say "No, we did not seize the coins."
3)  Fincen could deny your FOIA request, in which the answer is "Yes, we seized the coins."
Regardless, it would be interesting to find out what documents would be unsealed and available, if any.

So law enforcement considers Bitcoin a currency.  And tax enforcement considers it a commodity?  I guess ML wannabes will have to go back to trading bubble gum and Tide detergent until the IRS gives an official ruling.

I highly doubt Cruz even knows what Bitcoin is.  But, we want *everybody's* support!  Bitcoin is for everyone.  Even politicians with whom we may disagree.

Mike Hearn addresses tumblers and identity here.  It's a challenge.  But, it's something that the core developers are working on.

I haven't seen this.  All Jeremy Allaire has said is that he advocates for reasonable regulation to provide consumer confidence.  If you think Bitcoin can go mainstream and survive without it, you are kidding yourself.  
Any legitimate Bitcoin advocate will say the same.

It's enough to prove the market is volatile.  And it is a negative story.  Though, ultimately, this is the GOOD type of regulation that is needed for the Bitcoin ecosystem to succeed.  Mom and Pop aren't going to jump into a system filled with scoundrels and thieves.  Just as the Silk Road bust was an initial BAD news story.  In the long run, it had a positive effect on the BTC market.

Would you need to get permission to run a payment terminal which accepts Diners Club, Discover, or American Express?  If not, adding a Bitcoin terminal should be no different.

Awesome!  Thank you.
*SECURITY QUESTION:*  Can a malicious poster post images embedded with trojans or viruses to Imgur?  If so, this would be a great way to take advantage of Bitcoiners and sneak in a key logger. 
I'm not a developer or hacker, so just want to ensure we as a community keep our eyes open for things like this in the future.  They ALL will be coming after our coins.

I am convinced that Blockchain based identity is vital to mass adoption of Bitcoin, or anything blockchain related.  
There will always be people who want to store their money with untraceable petty cash (dark wallet), but the majority of business will be done in the open.  To do this easily, you first need a way to transact with anyone effortlessly.  
What a blockchain based identity system will resolve:
- Transact using real names (similar to Facebook).  Eliminates need for QR codes, email addresses, etc.
- Eliminates the needs for third party websites to require a username/password to login.  This will instantly eliminate the mass hacking and identity thefts of corporate websites (Target, Home Depot, etc.)
- Enable effortless property transaction.  
The closest thing I've seen as a conceptual solution to this has been Keyhotee.  I'm sure there are a few others attempting to solve this problem as well.  
Once this occurs, that's when traction will really take off.

I'm starting to believe these reporters are just trolling us all.

It's been said before, but America is no longer the "land of the free".  I know many of us see Bitcoin and blockchain technologies to be liberators to this type of government overreach.  Though, in the meantime, expect to walk a thin line in America while doing so.

Try BitAddress.org.  They have an easy paper wallet design.  Though it includes the private key as well.  But, it does support bip38 encryption.

I reached out to who records most of the Coinscrum meetups in London.  But, he said he didn't have this Q&amp;A session on tape.  
It appears to be a Q&amp;A session after Mike Hearn's presentation, where he detailed the possible use of passports in Bitcoin to prove identity.  See his presentation deck here... 
I suppose the question had to do with Google and other tech companies submitting to NSA pressures... In Mike's response, he refers to Jeremy (Allaire), and notes the pressures his company Circle.com (and other aspiring legitimate Bitcoin companies in the US) will soon be facing.  
Mike basically says, when the NSA comes to your company with a warrant issued from a FISA court, you best be prepared to turn over data, or be faced with an indefinite jail sentence.
Regulators don't like anonymous systems.  And it appears Mike's proposal to use passports as a means of identity might appease the Feds.
EDIT:  Here's Mike's original presentation for context.

1) Simple, safe, offline storage for the masses.2) Simple, safe, ONLINE storage.  Coinbase UX sucks for the average Joe.  Circle may be the solution.  But my mom can't be trusted with offline storage.  Online wallets are necessary for mass adoption.3) Easy purchase process from reputable sources (opportunity for credit unions, USPS, Walmart, ATM companies, even traditional banks).  4) Regulators need to calm the f down!  Their war of words about ML is over the top.  The world will simply miss out the promise of blockchain technology should they over regulate.5) Bitcoin companies need to acknowledge that should they want this technology to live, thrive, and provide the world frictionless consensus in anything... then we need to work within the guidelines of the law.  We need to lobby our legislators on behalf of the community.  We need to be proactive and include the legislators in the conversation.  Trying to exclude them will get many of us thrown in jail, and delay adoption of blockchain technologies.

I really appreciate all the developers working hard building new technologies for the Bitcoin and crypto space.  Whether it be Mastercoin, Ethereum, BitShares, or others, these are all *VERY IMPORTANT* advancements for the Bitcoin community.  
I'm not a developer, so can't really speak to the development of Mastercoin Wallets.  But, a decentralized exchange is DESPERATELY needed for Bitcoin to succeed IMO.

Love James D'Angelo.  But, this news report is the WORST!!  More FUD and propaganda from the elites. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:37:54
I feel the Bitshares concept is really important.  Though, I still can't conceptualize how it's supposed to work IRL.  Anyone care to take a stab at helping explain it?

Loved your Paper Wallet video.  When can we expect more videos?  Would love more about offline storage.  Also, question regarding this news video of you paying for lunch.  How do you go about tipping?  I notice that no wallet apps have a good process for adding 15/20/25/30% tip options like Square App does.  Just curious.

I was in the room for this interview.  The room was filled with some of the top real estate brokers and tech companies in the world.  Although this session was underwhelming, it was great to see Bitcoin get stage time in such a setting.  Most of the audience were ignorant of Bitcoin.  But, I suspect this to change greatly over the next year or so.  Thia generation of real estate agents is very tech savvy.

Until the user base increases, Bad news will have ripple effects on the BTC price.  Though, we know as a community that if we focus on mass-adoption technologies and improvements to the ecosystem, the BTC price will rise.  Freaking out about these types of stories is short sighted.

Haha.  Touche'.  And agreed.
