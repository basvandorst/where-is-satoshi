1. Initial comic effect from the cartoon is that dragons in medieval fantasy environment have gold because power, mystery, or whatever. This dragon has gold for complicated political, economical and conspiracy theory reasons. It's incongruous. Thus funny.
2. OP title is "Hodlers be like" --&gt; parallel done between BTC and gold hoarders. So if initial post is supposed to dismiss gold hoarder, OP dismisses BTC holders (which would be strange on this subreddit). Well, I doubt that's the case.

Sorry, not giving anything, it's not a segwit address.

You basically misunderstood the message OP wants to pass. No one is talking shit about gold.

That's exactly the point of an ETF. If you want to hold the key, you buy bitcoins directly.

While I agree 75-100% tax is serous bullshit, the 19% figures seems to be very incomplete information. Bitcoin capital gains are also subject to income taxation, which marginal tax bracket can go up to 45% for rich people

All finite strings of numbers, even very long ones, are in Pi. Randomness doesnt matter. You can find a string of 1 billion zeros in Pi if you want.

This. And I'm afraid currently low fees could desensitize big players of the importance of segwit adoption.
