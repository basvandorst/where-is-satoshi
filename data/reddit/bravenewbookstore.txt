Fair enough, but then so was the Mises Institute when it started I would imagine.

We've had the pleasure of speaking with some of he people who are putting this together and the line up of speakers is already huge and still growing.  Jeffery Tucker, Stefan Molyneux and many more.  We can't wait!
Also, be sure to add them on Facebook if you're into that sort of thing:

Actually the guys behind it are pretty brilliant guys if you study their works.  Not really sure how titles are ridiculous given that it's a major component of the operations of society generally speaking.

So the argument then is literally, "I don't have to know anything about something to have an educated opinion about it."  Good for you.
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:26:17
Because Rothbard, Konkin, Mises, Hayek, Spooner, Woods, Molyneux, Rose, Nakamoto and a laundry list of other names you probably should read before making such arguments.  That's why.

Boo regulation! Hooray Bitcoin!

The first non-satoshi holders are wealthy people today.  Typically who don't look or act it.

We're a bookstore (hence the username)... we've been open for 7 years.  So most english speaking nations most likely.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:58:26
We're only 7, but we love the bitty.

Cody's a pretty brilliant guy.
@_date: 2013-08-30 01:00:22
Answers that question then.

Yeah... boy old Maria Korolov is really on the ball though isn't she?  What a piece of work, lol.
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:12:33
Had no idea that existed otherwise we would have put it there, thanks!

Isn't John Mackey supposed to be speaking at that?  Kinda made me start wondering if Whole Foods might be the first grocery chain to begin accepting BTC
@_date: 2013-09-04 22:27:10
Interesting stuff to think about.  Thank you!

Pretty sure hes talking about any of the dozen banks that comprise the "Federal Reserve".  As Mayer Amschel Bauer Rothschild once said, "Give me control of a nation's money supply and I care not who makes it's laws".
A handful of elite own the banks that comprise the "Federal Reserve".  When the US gov't wants more money for all their wars and welfare they go to these bankster families and ask for more money.  If the money is to be given out, these same individuals can influence the circumstances under which such funds are lent out.
But you can imagine a situation where the private companies that actually build the roads, schools etc find themselves in the sphere of influence of bitcoin, and their employees begin to prefer payment in bitcoin.  The more these companies begin to prefer accepting BTC over the USD, the less power these private banks have over the policies of the government.  
If you take it to the extreme side, imagine that **all** companies which supply the goods and services government is reliant upon to operate say, "Ok, we're now only accepting BTC.  No USD".  In such a circumstance the government would have no more use for requesting money from the private bankers than they would requesting a ton of seashells.
Then consider that these same bankster families also have similar controls over many, many other nation states.  Not to mention numerous media sources such as AP &amp; Reuters.
In short: Bitcoin threatens to upset the entire geo-political socioeconomic structure as we know it, in a manner which is favorable to roughly 99.99999% of the population.

We've actually been kicking around getting one of these for the bookstore.  I would *love* to see one in the window everyday!
@_date: 2013-10-11 20:04:41
We are customers and we *still* can't seem to watch the video.  Just hoping some sweet soul out there is able to get access to it and maybe help shepherd it to other, perhaps more accessible regions of the internet.

Oddly enough one of our guys here refers to bitcoin as Christ returned in digital currency form.
