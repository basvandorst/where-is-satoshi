This is irresponsible and dangerous. Get this out of my crypto sub.

JM has been amazing every single time I have interacted with them.

People felt that at 100 USD. In my opinion, it is still early.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:26:59
Well hopefully no one claims it. Good luck.

No one knows man. I believe that 25k is definitely possible sometime in the next year or two, but it's all speculation.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:39:02
If this happens today, it will be historic.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:25
I'm watching this shit live. Hhhhhhollllly balls! Woooo! Buy buy buy!
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:12:47
That's because the price is going up rapidly right now. Report back in when it drops a little ;)
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:23:01
Fuck man. Hopefully this fuck who stole your coins is dumb and sent it to another GDAX account. If so, it might be possible to recover them by contacting coinbase ASAP.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:51:09
not worth it. dont even try
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:12:36
Probably gone... But email coinbase to see if it can be cancelled
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:31:35
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:01:41
Pretty much... :/
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:46:14
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

@_date: 2018-02-01 23:03:46
You don't understand what you invested in. Since you were uneducated, you essentially were gambling. You then compare stocks in companies to a digital currency. I'm glad these dips are happening because they are getting fools like you out of the market.

Brad Sherman is a tool.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:04:15
Yep! I'm hodling long term, but I keep forgetting that when I watch the markets daily. I need to delete blockfolio and sign out of my exchanges for awhile... *Sigh*
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:32:37
No. I'm just saying zoom out of the charts.

It's not a hard truth, it's an opinion. You have literally no idea what the market will do. You may be able to convince yourself that you can see the future, but the truth is, even the most experienced traders are baffled by the crypto market.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:53:59
Lol good luck
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:18:57
nice! just be careful what info you share online. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:05:06
Everyone has to start somewhere. At least he is thinking about investing.

That's how much an entire coin costs.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:51:09
lol. salty much?

It is a screenshot of coinbase, which is an online cryptocurrency exchange. It shows that he just bought 0.1btc.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:04:25
