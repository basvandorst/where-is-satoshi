It certainly depends on the situation.  In the case of Henry Magee from Burleson County, Texas, he was found not guilty (in a jury trial) on charges of capital murder after the local sheriff's office performed a no-knock raid and he killed one of the officers.
Granted, that's only one instance of self-defense rights being respected.

Self defense laws don't allow you to shoot someone because they're stealing your property.  That's considered manslaughter or murder depending on the circumstances.  
Self defense laws such as Castle Doctrine or Stand Your Ground allow you to defend yourself with lethal force when there is reasonable cause to believe that an assailant is attempting to end your life.  Meaning, if you come at me with a knife, or a pipe, or some sort of tool that will aid you in administering deadly force then I would be justified (maybe) in using a firearm to neutralize my assailant if I am unable to escape the situation by non-violent methods.  
At the end of the confrontation I'm probably still going to get arrested and go to jail.  I'll (probably) have to go to court and present a case proving that the shooting was justified.  Even if a jury finds that the shooting was justified and I'm cleared of any legal repercussions, I can still be sued in civil court by the assailant's family.  
If you have any other questions, I'm not a lawyer but I've done my research and taken several courses on concealed carry laws.  I'll be happy to answer anything to the best of my abilities.  
\*\*Side note\*\* All "self defense legislature" is different from state to state.  I really only have a perspective from my own state, so it may be different elsewhere.

ATM owner/operator here.  
You're not paying a fee for "your" money.  You're paying a fee for MY money.  
I'm providing you a very short-term loan, for which I charge a "convenience fee" that can range anywhere from as much as 25% all the way down to as little as &lt;1%, depending on how much the machine charges and how much you withdraw.  
If you would rather drive to your bank and withdraw for free, you're not hurting my feelings.  It's called a "convenience fee" because it's there for your convenience.
@_date: 2019-03-27 06:16:59
(I know this may not apply to you, but others may benefit from it)  
LPT: get a no-fee credit card with a reward program and use it to make every day purchases instead of a debit card.  Pay the credit card off every month to avoid interest charges.  
It takes a little more self restraint in keeping track of your finances to ensure you don't spend outside your means, but you protect yourself in more than a few ways from things like fraudulent charges, overdraft, skimmers, outages, as well as building your credit score at the same time.

We, as ATM operators, usually only assess the one charge that (in America) we are legally required to notify you of.  The second charge that isn't mentioned is a fee assessed by your bank for using an "out of network" ATM.

If this were true, you'd see a lot less ATM's in places like gas stations, bars, and restaurants.  Nobody would want to pay the price to maintain or upkeep them if there wasn't a way to recoup their losses.

I prefer the loan analogy, mostly because I won't be reimbursed for your withdrawal until the following business day.  I can't say you're wrong in the way you see it, we just have different perspectives.

It seems like you may be misunderstanding how purchasing BTC works.  It seems that you're under the impression that attempting to transfer your BTC to a cold-storage wallet (such as a ledger or trezor) will be affected by the price at the time it's transferred.  
This is **not** the case.  
Buying BTC is like buying any other commodity.  If you purchased (for round numbers sake) $250,000 worth of BTC at a valuation of $10,000, then you purchased 25 BTC.  As the valuation goes up and down, the quantity of BTC you own **doesn't** go up and down.  You will continue to have 25 BTC until you buy/sell/spend any quantity of it.  
If you were to initiate a transfer from RH to a cold wallet, you'd be transferring 25 BTC minus fees regardless of what the spot price is on the exchanges.  
Not sure if any of this addresses your concerns about initiating a transfer, but it seemed like it needed to be addressed after reading some of your other comments in the thread.

I'm referring specifically to the USA.  The big chains would still have them, sure.  Unless the banks are subsidizing the cost by charging their own customers some kind of fee, it becomes an unsustainable business model for independent ATM deployers.

Most ATM's are owned by small(ish) businesses.  Banks generally will only own the machines at their own branches.  You can buy ATM's from many different companies, including the manufacturers directly (in most cases).  It's a good business to be in, to be honest.

Switch to credit cards for all your purchases and pay them off at the end of the month to mitigate much of the risk.  Find one with a reward program you like.  
The biggest benefit is that if your credit card gets used without your knowledge, they stole the credit card issuer's money, not yours.  Your money is still in your account and if the CC company finds you at fault, they can't just reach in your bank account and take the money.

Can't say I disagree with any particular point you make.  I disagree with using CC's for revolving credit.  I try not to carry cash for security reasons because of the business I own, so I don't have many options for making purchases other than using a debit or credit card.  Faced with those 2 options, I would definitely prefer using a CC so there's an additional layer between would-be-thieves and my bank account.

You say the fees are high, but they're drastically cheaper than using credit or debit.  The difference is that you're aware of it when using Bitcoin because you're the one paying it, whereas with a credit/debit card the merchant is paying the fee and passing it on by raising the price of goods and services rendered to compensate.  
Also, you have the unique ability to tell the chain how much you're going to pay for your transaction, where interchange on credit/debit is determined by the processing companies and ISO's.

I had downloaded Bitcoin Core and used it to download the entirety (200+ GB) of Bitcoin's history.   I've since decided to go a different route for accessing my wallet and would like to remove that 200+ GB of data on my hard drive.   
Does anybody know where the default save location for that data is on a windows based computer?  I have had no luck finding it by looking in the Bitcoin Core program, uninstalling BC, searching my computer for files larger than 1 GB, etc... as well as several other methods of locating the data.

I understand what you mean, but the crypto markets don't shut down 2 days a week.  This isn't a normal commodity being traded.  Why measure it in traditional ways when this is anything but traditional?  My measure is that of a quarter and half year time frame.  We can argue semantics all day, but you're evading the point of the intended conversation for the sake of creating an unnecessary argument.
I'm not trying to predict markets here.  I didn't come here to be educated on how other markets work, because I don't need that.  I came here to ask the community's opinion about the information presented and what it means to you.  If it doesn't mean anything, then that's fine.  Tell me about that.

@_date: 2019-05-01 17:01:25
I like to think of 3 and 6 month averages to be relatively short term trends.  I don't think they'll have much of an impact on long term trends, but definitely show an increased or renewed faith in BTC since the end of last year.  It's tough to determine what "long term" means at this point given the history of BTC is so short, but I don't think I would be able to call 3-6 months "long term".
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:28:22

@_date: 2019-05-01 16:55:06
This **is** a short term moving average in my opinion.  I agree that all this means is that we're developing an uptrend.  I'm not trying to predict the future at all.  The point of the post is to show that investors **seem to be** regaining faith in the value of BTC over the past 3 to 6 months, which can **possibly** lead to higher adoption rates through increased positive publicity for cryptocurrencies in general.
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:36:44
So rather than attacking how the information is presented, and through the lens of looking strictly at the past, how do you interpret this data with regard to the state of the BTC environment on a global level?

@_date: 2019-05-01 13:53:27
In the interest of full disclosure, I don't day trade.  I hold an amount of BTC, but have no intention of looking at this as a short term, get rich quick scheme.  
Here's my opinion about it.
That being said, to everyone making the smartass comments about the window, this is simply a way of looking at trends.  The 90 day trend is going up and the 180 day trend is also going up.  This means that people are buying more than they're selling, and have been doing so with increased faith that the value will continue to go up.  This upward trend also hasn't been seen since the last bull run.  
What do I think this means? 
Just that it's trending upward.  Which could mean great things for adoption of the technology, inspiring a new group of forward thinking individuals to begin using Bitcoin as it was intended.  I'm not changing my buying habits because of this information, and I certainly don't intend on selling it for fiat to make a couple pennies.
Again I don't think this is about Lambo's and the moon, but if the price continues to make steady movement upward as it is currently trending, expect a lot of publicity that brings new people into the crypto sphere.  
If you encounter someone taking an interest in crypto, do your best to answer any questions they might have so that more will join and adopt.  Be honest with people and if you don't have the answer for a question, don't just make something up or give out false information.  
Bitcoin is a brave new world, and there are going to be many that are unwilling or unable to see through the hype and smear pieces to the root cause of why they should care about this.  
I learned this motto at a young age and it has never steered me wrong yet: Be Prepared.
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:32:54
You're one of the few that is hitting close to what I was looking at.  I'm not trying to use this info as a predictor of anything, but as an indicator of overall faith in BTC and how that faith looks to be on the rise.  This means good things for the overall environment surrounding BTC.
