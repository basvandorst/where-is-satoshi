Coinbase really isn't worth the $10. Their fees are high, their new terms of service are shady, and their customer service has a lot of room for improvement.

If the folks who sign up actually use the account and the higher fees end up costing them $10 more than what they would have paid elsewhere, then it wasn't free at all.
Nothing is ever really free, dude.

SSL cert isn't valid... nope, not loading that site. Nice try though.

You don't need the bitcoin client at all when you're mining for a pool.
If you sent your mining profits to your client's receive address, then you'll see your .02 btc when it finishes downloading the blockchain, and you can sent it to where you wanted it then.
You can use that address as much as you want, it's your own personal wallet, but you should read up on how to secure your wallet if you intend to do so.

See if he'd invest in blow stamps, instead.

Wow! Thank you so much. =)

Good call. I use Coinbase to automatically purchase 100 USD worth of bitcoin every two weeks (on paydays), and that account is performing WAY better than my 401k.

If you're going to mine, Bitminter probably has the easiest pool setup. Just go to  and sign up for an account. Then you can just run their java miner right from the page. As long as your Jalapeno is plugged in and powered up, it should just work.
You'll still need to set up a wallet for payouts, but you can find instructions for that all over the place.
Lastly, I'd be a jerk if I didn't point out that somebody else already gave better advice. You can turn an instant profit by selling it on ebay right now. Use that money to buy bitcoin, and you'd end up with more than that jally would probably ever mine.
