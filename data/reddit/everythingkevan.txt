Well, using Coinbase you don't own the private keys, basically meaning you don't have the bitcoin. If something were to happen to coinbase. You could be in trouble

Doesn't close.

If there is a "large" crash then it will drop to $1200-1500. This time is a bit different with the large scale of new users buying bitcoin. Since the large demand increase, "smart" users will buy at lows and eventually drive the price back up. Just my 2 cents

I'd say week+ for a response sadly. I asked for my limits to get increased 3 weeks ago. I received an email that they increased my limits but they didn't actually get increased so I submitted a ticket and it took 5 days till I got another email that they were increased. Not even an answer to my ticket.

Would love to hear from someone who has one. Was looking into them today.
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:03:13
Appreciate it 
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:03:24
This is good news!

Bank transfer usually takes 5-7 days.... Also coinbase is down currently. Keep it safe by not keeping in an exchange or online
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:05:05
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:56:59
Yes any online wallet would work!
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:01:28
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:17:49
May I ask why?
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:39:55
I wouldn't say likely, I'd say there is always a chance. Read the newcomers thread it details everything well.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:07:26
My source says it will be worth more than it is now. Hop in and HODL
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:03:00
Damn, very good friend I must say
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:59:09
Worth the look 
 
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:50:20
Interested in this as well.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:55:49
You sure it's not Milo?
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:53:14
That saved me time +1!

I'm guessing you are referring to under 18 years old. You can buy through Coinbase your just need your parents to sign off on it and upload their ID
Found this on there forum 
Parental consent can be obtained by completing following steps:
Using the same email address associated with the minor's Coinbase account, please have your legal guardian sign this form: 
Have your legal guardian upload their ID on the Coinbase account:
Email this information to us at support

Is your bitcoin pending? I purchased some last week it went through three days ago on the banks end and I just received it a minute ago on Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:10:19
The time is right all the time for the long term! Buy now and I'll see you in a few years 
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:31:27
Thanks man! Appreciate it 
@_date: 2017-06-05 01:54:22
Usually takes a week. Mine was still pending after 9 days then went through. You have nothing to worry about!
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:05:33
Def a scam! Careful 
Edit: good to see you removing your comments asking the guy to post his report of what he finds! 
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:50:26
You did delete the comment responding to Your whole thing is sketchy. Why set up a website blog explaining everything to make hardly anything. Idk if your phishing or making money off referral clicks but it just doesn't add up. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:47:54
ofc ill make a new post to open some discussion.
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:53:46
Yessss, take control of your coins!
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:22:28
RESULTS POSTED!

Your trying to refer people to a site you don't even know a lot about using a janky Wordpress blog. Nothing is worth doing for 0.0000000001 bitcoin anyways. Something just isn't right here.
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:14:35
Same thing happened to me. I happened to get mine last night finally! 
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:27:58
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:15:27
It's compared to last week... Hence "Since"
