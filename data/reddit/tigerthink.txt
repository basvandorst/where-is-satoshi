It's been around for 4 years, hasn't really gone anywhere except for silk road, hype, and bubbles.

Doesn't immediately cashing out to USD kind of defeat the point of using bitcoin in the first place?

Paypal already does this...

Right now Bitcoin's price is controlled by speculators.  I don't think this will ever change.

Bitcoin has been around for years dude.  People were saying that years ago.

In other words, the only way anyone can be convinced to spend Bitcoins is if they're bitcoin investors trying to make them go up... what a value prop.  The bitcoin circle-jerk at work™

If you'd studied economics (I've studied it a little, but I'd be interested to hear what an economics major thinks), you would know that lots of things that appear obvious are actually wrong when analyzed using the tools of economics.
Anyway, let's say that soon after acquiring bitcoins, merchants who accept bitcoin sell them immediately and convert back to dollars.  So for each time someone buys a bitcoin to make a purchase, someone sells the same number of bitcoins (as reddit does when you buy reddit gold) on the open market.  The net effect of increased merchant adoption might be that just as many bitcoins end up sold for dollars as bought for dollars.

Arguably the only people using Bitcoin are speculators though.
I'm a bitcoin heretic eh?  :P
