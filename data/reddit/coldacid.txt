That's why protocols are more important than code. A leaky implementation can be fixed; a leaky method of communication has to be replaced.

They are sustainable so long as there is an arms race in mining (i.e. so long as people keep using BTC and hardware for mining improves). Once hardware ability plateaus or if people stop using coins (and therefore eliminate the need to mine blocks) ASICMINER will no longer be worth investing.

The thing is, there's still a lot of existing dust from before the ban on dust outputs became "law".
I'm thinking now that a better solution would be for clients to try and get rid of dusts by including them as inputs for larger transactions, even if the user already has a large enough coin to spend for them (something I've been doing thanks to coin control to get rid of my pre-existing dusts and low-value coins). It'd work better if the attachment of the tiny coins didn't taint the priority of my transactions, though; perhaps what's really needed is to ignore the smallest input coin when calculating priority for a transaction with two or more inputs where the ratio of the coin values are 10:1 or larger.

Until Bitcoin's use reaches a tipping point, it *does* matter. Most people won't use something they don't understand unless they see everyone else around them already using it. Bitcoin's proven itself, but now we really need to focus on the growth stage, which means determining how best to sell people on using it. And that means having a quick explanation to get our feet in the door.

Even before the American banks started crashing *en masse*, RBC, Scotia, and TD were becoming major players in US banking. They're going to play by Washington's rules as much as Ottawa's because of how much they've invested in their own takeovers of American banks.
@_date: 2013-10-08 01:16:26
Yeah, but everyone starts off by seeing everyone else using it. You're conditioned to use it, understanding or not. That's the one advantage fiat has over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies -- mindshare.

I don't feel threatened by the banks, actually; for me, participating in Bitcoin is more of a fun experiment. Sure it would suck if governments and banks were able to kill off the system, but honestly I'm nowhere near close to having enough of a stake to really care. It's just another variant on internet points to me.
All I'm doing is pointing out a pattern that is seen all over, not just with regard to Bitcoin. Entrenched leaders in any field see disruptive technologies or social shifts as a threat to their position, and will act as they can get away with to remove or co-opt the threat. The last 20 years or so have been a very good demonstration of that, especially in tech and telecoms; no surprise that those who profit most from the modern currency system would react similarly to the old tech and telco incumbents of the 80s and 90s.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:19:41
Pretty much my feeling exactly.
Small-time miners are going to be outclassed by this hardware, and the ROI from mining for those not using heavy-duty equipment is going to plummet. These systems will make it pointless for people like myself to continue mining.
What it ends up as is a few giant players controlling the game, just like with modern banking. What's the point in participating in Bitcoin when that becomes the reality? Oligopoly is just as bad as monopoly.

In that case, like I said to pardax, why not just create an address solely for authenticating with a particular site? Besides, the fear of a public key being *public* because of the remote possibility of key cracking in the quantum future just reeks of unnecessary paranoia to me.

You missed point. If there's no regulations, *someone* will create some for an advantage, and someone else will pay for them. Same reason why anarchy can never work -- someone will find a position that allows them to wield power over others, and the whole system starts up again.

CoinBox tracks payments from its partners to particular Bitcoin addresses and pays out to addresses when the threshold is reached. Partners pay in lumps to CoinBox, and CoinBox pays in lumps to addresses. This way, dust transactions are entirely avoided.

Why are you hung up on the finiteness of Bitcoin? We could hit technological limits for mining (and therefore difficulty) plateau before we reach the 21 million mark. Sustainability of ASICMINER doesn't rely at all on the value limit of Bitcoin -- only on the ability to crunch enough hashes and sell enough hardware to keep making profit.
As for an estimate on transaction costs, just look at the blockchain. Top of the head says about 0.3 BTC per block average, but there's nothing keeping it from being zero, or greater than 1 BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:08:00
That's the plan. Once I make enough to cash out of my pools without fees, I'm turning off the BTC mining.

Public keys are usually safe to share. In fact, for PKI schemes, you *have to* share your pub key so others can encrypt messages to you, or verify signatures made by you. The whole point of PKI is avoid the use of a stealable, shared secret key.

Could it be that the site had a dead man's switch that would kill everything and replace the site with that pic, and that with the arrest DPR was therefore unable to push the button to keep the switch from firing?

Alright, thanks.
Even if they were real, it'd not affect me, though, nor hopefully (most) of the BTCTalk community; we should all be smart enough to not reuse passwords these days anyway.

In this case, the transaction fee was a huge, GOB level mistake. This wasn't so much taking a hit as it was not screwing someone over who had an accident manually creating a transaction.

And as soon as miners in the BTC Guild pool see that the pool is doing some strange crap, pull out and switch to another pool, therefore making the blackmail or threat of execution useless. Unless, of course, said country's military went and did that to all the miners on BTC Guild as well.
@_date: 2013-10-02 12:45:52
As I see it, the "something you know" is still there but just localized to your own machine. You need to enter a passphrase/password still to unlock the private keys in your Bitcoin wallet or your certificate/PGP store, you just aren't using one at the level where it can be copied by unscrupulous sites or communication channels. Using signatures or certificates, then, makes the "what you know" component safer.

I wouldn't classify people running those to be small-time miners. Monster GPU miners are likely to move to ASICs as they recoup the costs of their current rigs, anyway. What I'm concerned about are those of us who've been participating from less powerful systems, but have still been able to see some return from working in pools or having lucky breaks.
There'll be no point in us little folk continuing on once these ASIC systems start flooding the network. The difficulty increase will simply push us right through the floor.
@_date: 2013-10-02 13:37:37
Wouldn't creating a new address and just not using it to accept incoming payments work, then?

Actually, you don't need central CAs to work with SSL. It's just that currently the system is rigged that only centrally signed certificates are trusted. There's nothing stopping people from using self-signed certs, or developing a web-of-trust certificate authentication system, it's just that nobody really bothers to do something like that and shake off the yoke of the CAs.

Exactly. The chance is good then that the data the DEA *does* have is out of date, from the Freedom Hosting takedown, and that everything else is scratched -- so long as DPR wasn't dumb enough to keep backups at home or any other trackable location.All the same, I wouldn't want to be an SR buyer or seller right now, since we can't be sure of this. It's all speculation, and users should be washing their wallets if they haven't already.
