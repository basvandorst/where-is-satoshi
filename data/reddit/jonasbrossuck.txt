i'm in no way qualified to have an opinion on this. i have no cryptocurrency but i want to see it succeed, but from what i read there is a lot of scalability issues and it's in its very early stages, which turns the whole pricing thing into a huge speculation, and all the manipulation and non-regulation thing too

imo cryptocurrency is like gambling so i only lurk here. imo everyone should follow at least the flowchart in r/personalfinance and set up emergency funds, pay off debt, then play with bitcoins
e: i'm flattered for some reason people are replying to my comment, and even giving gold for it!
to all the people replying with success stories: i'm happy for you and even jealous, but the reason why i left the original comment was trying to have new reader be "safer" and have at least a safety net in case cryptocurrency crashes and they can't pay rent or buy food, etc

i think this is wrong place to ask this since you'll get very one-sided answers but i don't know where is a more "level-headed" place

offtopic, but i for the life of me cannot figure out what's happening with the logo on the front of the car, someone care to explain it to me? is the mazda logo opening like a door? the perspective is really messing with me

care to elaborate to someone who only read about bitcoins and not own any? from the FAQ on top of the page  it says it's "nearly instant". is that no longer the case? or is it _still_ fast, just _inefficient_?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:36:26


stupid question: so if there are 1 billion computers on the network, all 1 billion computers need to agree? i.e. the more computers are on the network, the longer it takes for transactions to go through?

thansk for answering!
let's say it takes 10 minutes for the transaction, and at t=0 it's $10,000 and at t=10minutes bitcoin price is $20,000, how much is the user buying the coin at?

good point, maybe that's what he meant haha. i've read a lot of negative things about bitcoin so i assumed lol

thanks for replying, it doesn't seem like ISPs want to compete though, there are many instances of ISPs getting fund to improve network but they just took the money without doing anything (for example 
if ISPs are given the power to filter internet, doesn't it give them too much power?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:03:24
ask IRS
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:14:08
interesting point, but isn't the entry point really high which basically no one can enter the market?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:45:51
stupid question: if there are more computers on the network, doesn't that speed up the speed? and more transactions per second will be possible?
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:07:40


imo there are not "reputable people" suggesting specific figures. it's all speculation

wait i'm confused, are you saying that everyone trying to _support_ net neutrality is a bad thing?
without net neutrality, doesn't that mean that ISPs can block/slow down traffic as they see fit? how is that better for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:00:10

let's say i use electrum wallet(so i wan to keep it on my desktop since having it online is not safe)
is there a down side to use a "light" wallet like electrum? if i dont' want to download the entire blockchain? i searched a little bit and from what i can gather, having a light wallet is like only verifying the current transaction and not "since the beginning", is that safe?
let's say i have gemini set up, how do i transfer the coins from gemini to my desktop wallet?

noob question to go along with this: if i buy 1 BTC @ $3800, and immediately try to get cash out of it, i would only get $3724?
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:29:43
you should also ask this question in other subreddits like r/personalfinance r/economy r/investing to get a more complete picture(if you ask here you'll get mostly "YES TO THE MOON!" answers)

what do you guys do about taxes? reading/searching on bitcoin-related subs it looks like there are lots of forms to fill and report come tax time, and all the sell/buy taxes going on....
how do you guys keep track of everything so you don't get in trouble?
