You are changing the definition of success. It is already successful as a currency and protocol, no matter the exchange rate. What i said was it being successful as a competitive currency in a global economy. At $380, it only has $5mmm total value and is laughable. To be successful as a global currency, it needs to be active with trillions of dollars of value and the only way to do that is through a much higher exchange rate and ridiculous volatility until then.

I'm a buttcoin slayer, not a buttcoiner. I'm saying that altcoins will die (drop to zero) if there is no interest. Coins don't go on and on forever. There is no guarantee they will go on forever, but once they reach a balance of utility and demand, they can be sustained. But to say a coin will always have value is ridiculous.

I agree it's susceptible to manipulation, but really, what better alternative is there to measure the size of the economy?

I don't support any altcoins. I think they are a good platform for testing new features, but if anything turns out good, bitcoin can just adopt it. Consider the difficulty of changing protocols after infrastructure has already been built around it. Telnet still survives today in light of SSH simply because of the cost of upgrading old/existing stuff. Adding a 5th octect to ipv4 would require countless upgrades to hardware, software, and applications. I don't think, IMHO, bitcoin will be replaced. Others will certainly compete, but I don't think they are ready for competition yet.
All crypto is a risky bet, but bitcoin is probably the safest with still a very large potential return even starting from $360/btc.

Whats interesting about all of this is that there is a purpose for governments to inflate the money supply, but without any check, it can destroy a nation.

Miners are always paid "enough" relative to the worth of the network. Price goes up? Miners get more value for securing the blockchain. Prices goes down, miners drop off and security weakens until the price point matches. You don't get a million dollar safe if the value you're protecting is only worth $1000.
The protocol doesn't collapse due to price, only its security relative to its value. Also, the rule of bitcoin isn't "the longest chain", it's "the most work", which takes difficulty into account. The blockchain is still secured by the history of its highest difficulty.

 bitcoins are created from nothin by writing "draft checks" from "nobody" to "yourself/miner" in the amount of a reward value. this is for your work you performed in proving the provinance of other bitcoins being spend and the authority of the spender to do so.
 this "reward value" is based on a formula that divides the value in half every 210,000 blocks that get added to the blockchain (think of blocks as pages in an accounting ledger). As you might guess, the bitcoins that can be brought into existance over time eventually gets to zero, and no more bitcoins can be created. this number will top out at about 21 million bitcoins in about 140 years. about 90% of them will be created in the next 16 years or so.
 Gyft.com will let you buy amazon gift cards.
Altcoins should be considered "experiments" to the bitcoin experiment. Not worthy of your attention unless you're really keen on risky penny-stock type trading.
Mining is a pro game at this point. Think about it like the gold boom and what gold mining is today... you to be you could mine with a shovel and a pan, or just pick it up off the ground. Now, you can only be profitable if you own a couple dozen dump trucks and other heavy equipment.

Dear Peter,
I was one of your first customers to buy gold from you with bitcoin. I was happy to show you how easy it worked for you. The operator's expression when the sale completed was priceless to me.
However, your vocal position about bitcoin leaves a very sour taste in my mouth and you'll never see me buy another piece of gold from you.

The information the miners is hashing is not random, but well known, specifically, the hash of the previous block. Since this information must be a part of the hash process, and the output of a hash operation results in effectively random information, saying the hash is "0000000xfe...." does no good and can be proven fake.

Perhaps you are unaware that a feedback loop in the protocol limits the rate at which blocks can be calculated? Blocks were created once every ten minutes when it was just Satoshi and Hal and it's still once every ten minutes with everything we got now. 
Even if you were some how magically able to transport that futuristic computing device back in time to today and turned it on, you'd only be able to rapidly process the next 2016 blocks at which point, the difficulty would compensate and throttle you back down to 10 minute blocks. If you applied that hash power to the genesis block and tried to recompute the blockchain to something else, again, you'd get throttled after the 2016th block.

The only way it would work is if ALL governments declared it illegal. If not, then you'd have pockets of nations grow it because it is more efficient.
Even if they all did, it would not stop it entirely and it would become an "offshore asset" or gold 2.0. The government tried to make that illegal before and it didn't last.

Listen up and pay attention, buttcakes. 
What are the threats of centralized mining? 1) censorship; 2) spend replacement; 3) and tarpitting. That's it. As it stands now, if a pool operator, using voluntary computing power, starts abusing miner trust by doing any one of these nefarious tactics, the minors and entire economy will collapse. Fortunately, and this is a key point and flaw in your theory so pay fucking attention retard, those voluntary minors can and will move away from those pool that are acting badly. In the case where pools collude to be evil, new pools will form because there is a natural incentive to protect their investment.

The easiest and ultimate end game for bitcoin is for it to be used as a currency, and not only for its rapid settlement payment network. That is, for each party to have and/or want the bitcoin currency so needing to exchange into something else goes away.

Basically you'll need merchants to set up a merchant account with Bitpay so they can give you their API key. From that, you'll be able to generate bitcoin invoices for display on your POS.
When the invoice gets paid, their server will do a call back to notify you the invoice has been paid.
The merchant has the ability to specify the level of security they require so that the callback happens at zero confirmations or higher.
To my knowledge, there has never been a successful double spend to a bitpay merchant so zero confirmations are acceptable.

And there are sufficient reason for any government to allow its citizens to pay in bitcoin, and hold them, if for nothing else than the IMF contributions it makes. Yea, the IMF is ultimately going to be all up on this like it is gold - if ya know, the protocol doesn't fail.

its best to not let someone else control your bitcoins, which i what coinbase does. however, if you think they can secre them better than you while you are learning, then it might be a better option. coinbase has stated that they only keep 3% of bitcoins held online, just enough to keep operational, so only those are really available to be  stolen at any time, which reduces the risk of losing "much".

@_date: 2014-11-26 04:11:36
Nobody know when, but here's the how
(market cap) = (monetary units) X (exchange rate)
Right now, there's 5 billion dollars of value in bitcoin.
13.5 million bitcoin X $375 each = 5 billion
If bitcoin has a trillion dollars of value (spread out in ecommerce, adult entertainment, black market, "offshore storage/tax evasion", etc), then...
1,000,000,000,000 = (13.5 million bitcoins) * ($74,000 exchange rate).
Do your own math with your guess of what the market cap of bitcoin can be.

I look at how bitcoin is functioning as a protocol and its potential to make the economy move easier. Both are doing well. Since I'm in the game for a long time and I have not risked more than I can afford to lose, these bumps don't bother me one bit.

There are two basic kinds of financial instruments: asset instruments and debt instruments. Gold silver and bitcoin are asset instruments, while IOUs are debt instruments.
The differences are many, but basically, asset instruments get value from consensus, meaning people generally agree voluntarily that something has value. While debt instruments require a authoritive decree backed by violence, counter party risk and the promise it can be redeemed for an asset instrument like gold, silver, bitcoin.

There is no need for paper bitcoin. The reason for paper gold, as it was told to us, is that "gold is heavy and hard to move and settle. Lets use paper to trade, and we'll settle up the hard to move stuff later".
Well, bitcoin is frictionless. There is no need to paperize it because it is already weightless.

You can think of each spend coming into your wallet as a whole "bill", which must be spend as a whole later. Just like when you receive a $5 USD bill in your physical wallet. 
And just like a fiat bill when you spend it, you'll get some new bills in a smaller denomination after you spend. This is "change". Your wallet should have spend that change to another address in your wallet that can be spend again later.

I'm glad you recognize the PSEUDOnomymous nature of bitcoin. Are you aware that there are several public and private sector intelligence tools available to identify networks of bad actors.

Nodes would just "queue them up" until they got in blocks. If it kept up for long enough, nodes would drop the oldest most "complex" transactions from memory to make way for newer, less "complex" ones. As long as one node had enough ram to hold everything, no transactions would be lost and would get repropagated eventually.

security of the network fluctuates with exchange rate. higher exchange rate, more people can mine and the stronger the security gets. lower exchange rate, less people can mine and the weaker the security gets *for that period of time*, but all historical transactions are protected by the security provided at the time.

Same reason there are hundred bills, twenties, tens, fives, and ones I guess. 
It's not difficult when you start using them. It's just a decimal shift. 1 mbit is .001 bitcoins is 1000 bits. Bits is 6 decimal places instead of 8. Mbits is 3 decimal places instead of 8. Perhaps write it out a couple of times for it to start making more sense?

There are very clear and understandable reasons for bitcoin to be desired. Demand against a scarce resource means higher price. There is nothing wrong with pumping if there is clear truth to the pump.

The difference between value of gold/silver/bitcoin and fiat is the fiats value dies with the government that created it. Gold/Silver value has survived every government man has created.

if the price stays where its at, 5 billion dollars of economic activity is all that can occur in the bitcoin economy. that scenario is not likely given bitcoins usefulness.
if there are currently 2mm bitcoin users and each one owns only $2500, thats 5 billion dollars, the market cap of bitcoin. bitcoin IS NOT going to be a 5 billion dollar market, its going to be much more and the only way its going to get there is through a ridiculously high exchange rate, based on 100mm satoshi denomination , a bitcoin.

Heres a problem with tumbling . There are two types of bitcoin users: legitimate, law abiding ones who just want to have some privacy so they don't get a rubber hose in the face; and the unlawful type who do illegal things with their bitcoins.
When you mix, you don't get to choose the type you mix with. Therefore, there is some risk that when you, the "legitimate" one, who obtains your bitcoins from legitimate sources and provide KYC/AML info to do so, mix your coins to someone who is using them in a "bad" way. In such a case, law enforcement will follow the chain up to an exchange, or identify you via some other vector, and kick in your door at 3am to shoot you and your dog in the face in search of more evidence to catch the bad guy.

Sure, I was being hyperbolic, but prosecutors will tell you anything to get what they want. They have no obligation to tell you the truth. If you're not smart enough to know that or smart enough to get an attorney to tell you that, then they can and will control all the information you will make a decision from, under extreme duress of captivity. If you cave in during interrorgation before it ever gets to court in front of a judge, then its all fair game.

every bitcoin transaction is traceable to the previous one. even if you bought bitcoins from a random person on localbitcoins, where did that person get them that might give you up in a second when questioned? and where did you spend them that those future payments might end up at a kyc compliant company to serve as a link back? bitcoins are not anonymous and anonymity is ridiculously hard. use caution, or give up your freedom for a cage.

What you don't understand is there are debt instruments and there are asset instruments. Notes, promissory notes, fiat, etc are all debt instruments that REQUIRE a backing to have value.
Bitcoin, Gold, Silver, for example, are asset instruments that can be used to back debt instruments.

Gold is not backed by violence. Gold does not get its value by threat of violence by men with guns. It gets it value by voluntary consensus of men.
Fiat currencies are backed by violence because no reasonable person would otherwise think a piece of paper with a dead man's face and a number would be worth anything in any other circumstance. Fiat has to be backed by violence. Because they are debt instruments with the promise of being worth something valueable.
Gold/Silver/Bitcoin are assets instruments that don't need anything to back their value because all men voluntarily and independently agree that they do.

1. It was a general expression and educated guess, based on some fact as I witnessed a room full of miners at hashers united admit it wasn't them dumping coin to pay their electric bill - 99.9 of them said they held in the face of their board members wanting otherwise.
2. There are probable explanations.
3. If it's not the miners dumping, then that leaves whalebears and spenders. Whalebears are evidenced by drastic flucuations and we're witnessing a long term gradual decline. Therefore, its a safe bet it's spenders that don't replace what they spend.
4. You're free to form your own opinion based on whatever uneducated dice flipping you're use to.

I teach people about bitcoin every day. My experience is that they generally continue to show interest in it once they "get it", not abandon it. Far more continue to keep up with it than give up.

Bitcoin accuracy can only go down to 8 decimal places. they cannot made more accurate as that smallest unit is an integer, stored in int64. Additional satoshis could be allowed to be mined, violating a prohibited change. 
It is impossible to "split" all users holdings, which is what is meant by bitcoin being "infinitely divisible" since the atomic unit is an integer.
The only way this would work is if you allowed more satoshis to be created and redifined what a bitcoin was each and everytime more satoshi were allowed to be created. That, and you'd have to re-write every single line of code in the ecosystem that referenced a transaction since the monetary units would no longer be represented as int64. Good luck with that.

Their problem is that they can't know for sure if the money moved is still owned by the same person or a different person and they can't tell what is the "purchase" and what is the "change". Bayesian Inference can help with this, but it's only probable accuracy.

I leave a riskable amount of bitcoins on sites all the time.
As for banks and fiat, sure your money is there, but their money is not. Their loss increases their operational costs, which get passed on to you. So in effect, you do lose *some* of your money in the processing fees you or a merchant pays (merchants pass that cost along to you, either by making minimum purchase amounts, asking extra for credit card use, or simply by padding all their goods and services appropriately)

It's not that they spend too much money, it's that it was the best set of inputs to choose from.
Just like when you receive dollars into your physical wallet, you have certain bills to spend. example: 3 one dollar bills, a five dollar bill, and a twenty. if you need to only spend $5.5, you'd pull out a five and a one and get $.50 back.
Bitcoin operates the same way. when you receive bitcoins, called inputs, they have a specific value. When you spend, you must spend the entire value and get change back, just like you do bills in your physical wallet.
ninja edit: inputs and outputs are kinda relative. basically, a transaction has inputs and outputs. when you receive money, they are unspend outputs of the transaction. when you form your own new transaction by spending, those unspent outputs become inputs to the new transaction.

Kinda like how you never buy hashing power in a pool because I have no idea how to get an ASIC running? Fact is, there is a large incentive for the majority of people who don't have the skills to keep a computer secure enough to hold coins and will trust/hire a central authority to keep them. So instead of individuals casting delegate votes, you have banks casting those votes on behalf of the depositors. Same shit, different cologne. Except, you can't steal ASIC hardware over the Internet and you maintain physical possession to redirect to any pool you want at any time.

There are a zillion different wallets and they all have their pros and cons. The premise with bitcoin is that you don't need others to manage your wallet for you, and you shouldn't because it requires you to trust them (to not get hacked, or to otherwise run away with your money). 
Centralized wallets include services like CoinBase.com - they control the private keys that store your bitcoins and give you an interface to spend them - but they control the private keys.
Decentralized wallets include (Android) Mycelium, Electrum, BitWallet. You maintain full custody of your private keys. The ony trust you need to extend is to the other software you allow to run on your computer.
Personally, I buy bitcoins on Coinbase.com and immediately move them to a wallet only I control OR I buy them in face-to-face, cash only purchases with people I meet on localbitcoins.com or the trading interface in Mycelium. There is almost always a risk of someone not delivering their side of the deal - you just have to mitigate those vulnerabilities with various combination of smarts.
My best suggestion is to not learn about it on your own without a good level of technical skills. Join a local meetup and ask lots of questions. Ask people for help in public settings so you're not trusting any single individual. Most bitcoiners I've run into are very eager to share what they know.

You are arguing that you can separate currency from a blockchain. It is impossible. A blockchain would be nothing without a unit of value. What is going to go in this bankcoin ledger if not a digital currency? If its anything outside of its own digital currency, then you have counter party risk. Every account would have doubt as to the asset it says it holds.


What do you think a bankcoin user will have to do to get bankcoin? That's right, trade their fiat for it.


Fees credited in what currency? That's right, a bankcoin currency, backed by the bankcoin blockchain. Can't separate currency from blockchain.


Like I've said, I've seen grandmas and children use it successfully. You're the one underestimating the skills of the average consumer. And if you argue that it's not intuitive, then I'll suggest you've already had your fiat training when you were 5 or so and it was not intuitive at all for you in that context. i.e. What is this worth, how do I get it, where can I keep it, and what the fuck is change, daddy?

So here's where I get to tell you where you went wrong. You're saying "old blocks are not secure because moores law", but you really mean private keys won't be secure in the future. Even with that, you're getting warmer, but still wrong.
The key space is mother fucking immense. As in there are more atoms in the universe than there are possible private keys. So there literally isn't enough energy in the universe to brute force private keys.
What is possible, is that a weakness in ECDSA is found where one might be able to reverse engineer a private key from a public key. Fortuntely, public keys are not published until a first spend, so Satoshi's old coins are very, quite confidently, safe. For all other addresses, one would simply need to spend bitcoins to a new address with no bistory and wait until a new signing protocol was implemented.

Bitcoin addresses are not public keys - Addresses are hashes of public keys. Public keys are not exposed until their first spendn. None of Satoshi's known bitcoin addresses have any spends, therefore, his public key is not known. 
Satoshi's keys would be the worst keys to attack if a weakness in ECDSA was found because they are they most watched of all. A spend from those would cause much reaction. If Satoshi saw it, he would issue an alert and the blockchain would be rolled back (like it has in the past when critical issues have risen) until a fix was in place.

I don't see how that scenario would play out in the context of this story. There is no judge asking for your keys at the side of the road. The cop would just seize the suspicious piece of paper with a BIPS38 encrypted code and tell the guy he could pick it up at the station after he proves it's legal numbers. Then the guy would just go home and print out another copy.

Security and Convenience are, is, and always will be diametrically opposed.
If you can create a bitcoin private key in perfect secrecy, then BIPS38 wallet funds are perfectly secure. Obtaining perfect secrecy becomes the issue you must overcome. Perfect situation is to have a dedicate computer that never talks to, nor has the ability to talk to any other computer, except a printer, that can then never be used for anything not secret. As you start to re-use equipment for less secure functions, your security lessens.
TLDL in the context of high paranoia, the device used to generate private keys must be considered a black hole for data or a "data diode". It can go in, but never leave.

How does me spending a bitcoin on a product or service cause downward pressure on the price? If you say you "because the receiver is only passing the bitcoin to a possessor who is then dumping it on the market", then I suggest that is a separate and unrelated transaction and the initial exchange of bitcoin for goods and services has no downward pressure on the Bitcoin exchange rate.

It still allows for centralized control of mining. Instead of pooling their ASIC hardware to attack the variance problem, large stakeholders will pool their coins to attach the variance problem. PoS requires coins be unencrypted and online (even if its just in RAM) to prove stake which makes them vulnerable to theft and you can't steal ASIC hardware over the Interenet. Imagine some DPOS "bank" getting hacked with a crapton of coins and now the hacker can censor or tarpit transactions on the Internet either directly or indirectly by voting for evil delegates. Individuals holding physical ASICs and pointing them to pools is the most secure way to guarantee distribution, secure transactions, and a healthy network.
