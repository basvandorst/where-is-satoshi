When I got my trezor, the box was actually cut open (presumedly by customs). At first I was going to contact them (like the box says) but then I realized if someone backdoored the device so elegantly there's no way they would just carelessly cut/ripped open the box. In a strange way it gave me a sense of confidence my trezor was untampered with. 
In your case however, I'd be a lot more worried. If customs did open it, they don't give a fuck

Not, not really. The checksum is 32 bits, which makes a 1 in ~4 billion chance that a mistyped address is valid

Yes it is. If the majority of miners are enforcing the soft-fork, and a block is mined that doesn't obey the softfork rules, it will be orphaned...
It doesn't matter at all what the "economy" is doing (kind of the whole point of a softfork, in fact)
@_date: 2016-08-23 07:53:02
That's not true at all. First of if you mistype an address the checksum will render the address invalid. Secondly there are more atoms in the universe than possible bitcoin addresses, so because more than 1 address is in someones wallet that makes it also false.

Unless the 51% attack does something more ... malicious than transaction withholding, I doubt it's possible to run long enough to kill a chain. Miners are going to get sick of throwing away money, and stop sooner rather than later.
One idea would be instead of a normal 51% attack, use your (temporary) majority hash power start enforcing a soft-fork that cripples the chain. e.g. Enforce a blocksize of 10KB, or blacklist a whole bunch of addresses. Then "legitimate" miners will have to join your softfork to keep mining, and then they'll be in a big mess, with no obvious way out. Once all miners are on your softfork, they will effectively have to hardfork to get back to their original rules
But personally I think it's a bit dishonest, and would prefer people to just dump coins on the chain they don't support. For instance if bitcoin hardforked to a slightly more reasonable blocksize with ~&gt;80% of the economic support, I'd be happy dumping a few thousand bitcoins on the old chain (assuming it lives long enough for that to happen).

Most sites with users balances are going to be storing in cold storage *anyway*. I run a site, and ~98% of the funds are stored in cold storage for my own benefit. It's simply the safest and easiest way to make sure I don't go bankrupt in a hack. Without offering insurance, it doesn't add any extra cost or time if your coins get sweeped to cold storage too.
And most of hte time, when people or companies talk about under ground bunkers with military security etc, it's a marketing gimmick to mean they lease some services from one of the many companies that are in the mountains or bunkers (there's quite a few in Switzerland in abandoned WWII bunkers). You can literally rent a cheap VPS in a bunker for $1/day, it's not like the bitcoin wallet companies are hiring guards and what not.

Most privacy oriented services don't want to reuse addresses, but bitcoin core forces them. That is to say, if the address gets sprayed with unsolicited dust, it'll get spent linked in without the service wanting it to be

If anyone knew the answer to that, they wouldn't be answering you; they'd be making a killing on exchanges. But unless you want to speculate, you're probably best off just buying a week or two before you want to use it (buying bitcoin tends to take a while on most exchanges)


A lot, check some historical charts


At the time of purchase, they convert the dollar amount to bitcoin and take that amount of bitcoin. e.g. If I was selling something for $100 now, and you wanted to pay in bitcoin I would charge you 0.1753 bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:35:01
My phone isn't always online though. Although as an idea, you could publish a pubkey and people create an incomplete transaction, and encrypt it to your pubkey, and then send it to some big database (a DHT perhaps?). So then when your phone connects it connects to the DHT, fetches all things that are stored at your pubkey,  gets the incomplete transactions, decrypts them and then fills them out.
Or am I overthinking it?
@_date: 2016-08-11 01:52:16
If you have two outputs, and delete one -- all the money that would've gone to that output, will now be added to the transaction fee. (Transaction fee is the difference between the sum of inputs and sum of the outputs)

My understanding is that products like food does indeed have ridiculously cheap official price, but it's also extraordinarily scarce. The government sells it extremely cheap below costs, and people line up for hours or sometimes days to buy it. The amounts you can buy is extremely limited (they lose money on each sale) and that it's highly profitable to resell it on the black market for a more free market price.
Try to extrapolating from official food prices, would be like extrapolating that bitcoin is worth nothing, because faucets give it out for free
@_date: 2016-08-22 18:57:32
That's correct, but it's exactly the same as now. Bitcoin has always generated new addresses (that's why you need to backup your wallet).
But the problem is even if you use new addresses for anything, someone can "ping" one of your old addresses with some dust money and then watch it get spent-linked with your new transactions. Basically someone can force you to reuse addresses even if you take every precaution to avoid doing so
@_date: 2016-08-10 00:24:35
As someone who has been doing in-person trades for years, it doesn't work this way. First of all, you don't want to be sitting around waiting for confirmations (which can easily take up to an hour, god forbid they use a wallet that puts a questionable amount of fees).  What do you do in the case the bitcoins have been sent, but it's not sure how long it's going to take to confirmed, or if it's not  obvious if it'll ever confirm. Should you sit around for 48 hours, until the bitcoin can be respent? Which of the parties should have the risk?
Secondly, should the cash be given before or after the bitcoin transaction? Now at least one of the parties is hugely opening themselves up to being scammed.
As a seller of bitcoin, I could send the bitcoin with RBF opt-in to the buyer and ask for the cash while we wait for it to confirm. During the 10+ minute wait, I find an opportunity to slip away (while ordering, or going to the bathroom) and reverse the bitcoin transaction.
Or as a buyer of bitcoin, I could say I'm not willing to hand over the money until the funds have confirmed, and after the transaction has been made find a distraction to leave. Since almost no one knows how to use or does use RBF, they won't be able to reverse the bitcoin transaction and they'll be out of luck.
Contrast this with localbitcoin where we can do a rather atomic trade of bitcoin for money, at the expense of trusting localbitcoin.
Oh yeah, and worst of all, after the person gets scammed -- since the trade didn't go through localbitcoin they won't be able to leave bad feedback. 
So unless I already have established a high level of trust with someone, there's simply no way i'm going to circumvent localbitcoin to save a 1% fee.

Where did you get the address from? You must have copied and pasted it from somewhere? If you randomly mashed the keys, or mistyped it would be invalid
@_date: 2016-08-02 17:14:29


If you just do a pure transaction withholding attack, you are not going to be able to get any money out -- and you're not going to get legitimate miners to join you. If you on the other hand enforce a softfork, you can do both. Once enough legitimate miners join your softfork, you can even stop mining yourself.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:16:03
It's obviously a shitty situation, but what do you propose?
A) They give some people a 100% loss and others a 0% based on the implementation details of the hack (which wallet addresses were hacked and the associated users)
B) They open the flood gates, and allow everyone to race to withdraw. First in first served.
C) They declare bankruptcy, and users are last in line to get what remains after a few years of fighting
D) Everyone takes an equal haircut, the company trades on and hopefully can repay the amount lost

I think you might be overthinking it. It's probably just someone with too much money having fun. He also gave away a few bitcoin on irc. If he was trying to break the link of ownership, he would've used a mixer or sent it a casino and claimed it was a gambling loss etc.

mB is probably easier, and at the moment it's definitely a more practical unit. However I think what's more important than what is the most practical place to put the decimal, it's that everyone uses the same one (otherwise end users need to become experts on bits vs mB vs centibits vs bitcoins) and the momentum is definitely behind bits (bitpay, breadwallet, bustabit, moneypot all use it) :D

No, it's not true. First of all, what would they be selling the bitcoins for? If it's bitcoin&lt;-&gt;bitcoin trade, they can already do that by just depositing in a casino and withdrawing a few days later, and getting unrelated coins. 
Secondly, if the coins were "tainted" they would just tumble them and sell it on legitimate markets.

I disagree about priorties, I think bitcoin's network effect is far more important but it's not really my decision.
That said, there's some really easy wins that don't require any radical overhaul. 1. Coin selection improvements and 2. Allowing services to force bitcoin to not reuse addresses.
1. Is pretty straight forward, in fact it's mainly a bug ( that causes almost every single bitcoin transaction to have a predictable change output when it's not necessary.
2. Bitcoin core needs a way for privacy oriented services to never re-use addresses. What some analysis companies are doing is spraying address they're interested in with dust and then seeing what it gets spent-linked with. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 00:45:29
It's certainly not impossible and has been done before. Depending on the amount of entropy in your salt, will determine if your bitcoins are safe or not. It's probably better to just move the bitcoins out of a brain wallet.
Also the probability this is a scam is probably above 99%. Cracking bitcoin addresses is a zero-sum game, if they really had some amazing cracker they would do it themselves (after warning people, if that's their MO)
@_date: 2016-08-20 01:48:58
Agree. Although it's probably a lot harder to implement that. 
For the most flexible you would have X per minute, Y per MB.  (Where X and Y can be zero)
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:52:39
Hm, I do find the idea interesting and if it's implemented I'll support it on my site. However it really seems like a over complicated way to scale (especially from users perspectives), and will take years for wallets and services to actually support it.  Likely even longer than the lightning network, because the federated trust model is definitely going to be a lot more controversial. 
I'd much, much rather a simple hard-fork to something reasonably conservative (say 4 MB) to buy time for the lightning network. But I'd still like to see the side chain developed as well

@_date: 2016-08-17 14:28:11
I've read the paper, and more or less understand how it works -- but I have trouble imagining what the UI would look like for sending a payment to somebody. Instead of giving them a pubkey to send money to, you'd need to give them the address of a server who they would send the payment to (who will fill in the rest?). How would a phone wallet for instance receive money? Would it be safe for a phone-wallet to out-source the receiving of money to a third party service?
@_date: 2016-04-04 03:32:32
It's worth noting that bitcoin core itself defaults to 2 blocks for sending a fee. So I think this is a good test
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:11:18
Doesn't look very complex to me:
583.17 + 8.69 = 591.86
If $8.69 in fees is too much, use another exchange.
And the reason the live chart shows a slightly different price, is because it almost certainly uses the mid price or last traded price as opposed to the ask.
@_date: 2016-04-04 03:33:24
Yeah, it's saying that *regardless* of what fee you put, there's not going to be a &gt;95% chance of it confirming in the next block. Probably the biggest reasons is the amount of miners who are mining empty blocks

Their "instant transaction"'s is their business model. It's mentioned in the FAQ. I'm not sure, but it might currently be free while they futility wait for any adoption.


You can use ECC maths to do N-of-N  (like greenaddress instant send is 2-of-2) with just a normal signature. No native support from bitcoin required.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:17:59
Exactly. I've never heard of Flibbr before, but even if he's 100% trustworthy, what he saw means very little. For example, if tether was truly malicious it would be trivial for them to have something like browser-addon that find-and-replaces the USD balance of a bank account.
(That said, I don't have any exposure to or opinion on tether. But "evidence" like this certainly doesn't inspire confidence)
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:11:01
Generate change addresses wasn't the hard part of that (it's like getrawchangeaddress and then addwitnessaddress on that) .. but it's that if you go down the raw transaction path, that involves doing your own coin selection. And now that's a real rabbit hole...
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:51:54
No, because that just shows what transactions have confirmed but it doesn't offer predictions of what to use.
If you actually use core's estimates see they are "crazy" high, but in reality they're pretty decent.
A lot of it just really comes down to the confidence you need. If you want 99% certainty that your transaction is going to confirm within 1 hour, you're going to be paying insane fees. Because in your model you need to account for:
a) There might be a big surge in transactions outbidding you
b) Miners might be getting unlucky, and there's no blocks for a while
(which tend to coincide a lot..)
So yeah, most of the time it's pretty easy to say "haha coinbase are idiots. They paid 400 sat/byte, when they could have paid 200 sat/byte" but they were doing everything correctly and sanely.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:56:01
And it's a weekend, which generally means less high fee transactions
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:22:29
Except that 17k BTC represents the total amount of sourced money, but not the amount transacted. For instance, if I have a wallet with a single unspent of 1000 BTC and send someone 1 BTC, it'll need the source the 1000 BTC, even though I only sent 1.
If you look at blockchain.info's "Estimated Transaction Volume" it's actually "1,651 btc". So the fee is 0.9% of it. That's a lot more than my bank charges me ;D 
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:29:23
You're technically correct that /byte is useless. But most new sites are using "virtual bytes" which are segwit weighting adjusted, and calling them bytes. (But interestingly, not all sites. Like several major block explorers are using sat/byte as in actual bytes).
Personally I think the whole vbytes shit is a disaster, and we should've just gone purely to weight.
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:32:12
This is intentionally misleading and deceptive. Ever since segwit was activated transactions are mined based on the satoshis per virtual byte, not per byte.
So in reality, the transaction was 126.39 sat/B  based on the measure that every other site uses (including bitcoin core) and sites that monitor the mempool (e.g.  )
Honestly I think this is actually one of the biggest screw ups of segwit, as it is so confusing as gives people the opportunity to confuse by referring to actual, legacy or virtual bytes (depending on what narrative they're pushing).
There really should be a standardized unit for measure fee rates based per weight. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:43:00
This witch hunt is really getting pretty insane. Yes, they've been slow at implementing segwit -- but it's not as a easy as `segwit=true`. They manage at least hundreds of millions of dollars and probably have pretty hacked together software. I'm sure all hands are on deck trying to scale for the amount of customers they have, doing a botched segwit update is the last thing they want to risk. 
And even bitcoin core doesn't have proper released segwit support yet. It's really just not easy writing and testing quality software.
FWIW it took me about ~2 days to implement segwit support in my wallet, and yet a few months to roll it out in a real production setting -- and broke a lot of assumptions I previously had made (like all inputs had the same cost to spend) which required creating a fresh new wallet and migrating over to it
As for them sending with "high fees", that's kind of nonsense. 100 sat/byte is actually a pretty good estimate. Bitcoin core's default suggestion right now is 191 sat/byte (see: estimatefee.com ). Even if there's a 90% chance that a transaction of 10 sat/byte confirm next block, they need to care about the "what if there's no blocks for an hour" case.
Ideally they could be sending with lower fees, and then fee bumping if required. But again, that's complex stuff that's not easy to write (e.g. bitcoin core doesn't support reliable fee bumping yet)
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:06:16
There's already a lot of good technical advice here, so I won't repeat it.  But I will say, avoid dealing with anyone over private communication.
Bitcoin transactions aren't like a bank, they are effectively anonymous and can't be reversed. It is very appealing to scammers, who will be looking to "help" you. Unless you understand enough about how it works, it's very easy to be "confidence scammed".
If you deal over a public channel (like here) it's a lot harder for you to be scammed, as people can quickly point out when someone is misleading you.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:59:21
That's probably not helping. GreenAddress uses multisig addresses where they control one of the private key (so they can try monetize users by selling a service where they promise to not double spend), but as there's no signature aggregation it bloats the size of the transaction considerably. Combined with the blockspace usage of transferring your money to an inferior wallet, I don't think it's doing anyone any favors.
I'd instead recommend something like a trezor/ledger/electrum that all have pretty decent segwit support.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:19:35
Oh nice, you're right. I didn't realize fundrawtransaction allowed you to pass in your own change address. That's actually a lot easier than I thought.
And yeah, `addwitnessaddress` works fine on `getrawchangeaddress` .. at least that's what I'm running in production without problems so far :D
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:49:19
You are correct, it doesn't matter at all if the output is segwit or not (give or take a couple of bytes, for different types of outputs). 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:10:15
The cost savings of batching aren't nearly as high as you think they are, unless it's possible to consolidate for your utxo for very cheap (which for the last month, hasn't been a reality).
But this is a really worrying trend towards centralization that we need batched transactions by big players to be economical.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:09:38
I'd also like to point out that cheaper transaction fees are important for decentralization.
I know several people now who won't even entertain the idea of withdrawing bitcoin from their exchange because of transaction fees (also knowing they'll have to pay to send it back if they want to sell).
At the rate it's going, I'm worried that even the lightning network will be unattractive due to the cost of opening channels. I suspect large custodial services (like coinbase) will just start offering managed lightning (so you don't need to pay to create the channels yourself.
I sold 100% of my BCH because I think they're approaching the problem retardedly, but I'm not convinced doing nothing is hugely better.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:05:45
Well right now, a tiny transaction (1 input, 2 outputs) requires around $3 of txfees  even when using segwit.
$20 fees happen all the time when the person has a bunch of unspents that need to be cleaned up (happens often when someone receives more often than they spend).
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:46:19


Sure, that's fair enough. But there's a *lot* more centralization pressures from $20 transaction fees (where big businesses can use tricks like batching) than if we doubled the block weight limit.
It's like most things, there exists some happy balance in the middle.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:42:14
If you don't need to sell immediately, try use a small fee like 20 sat/byte. Will take days/weeks to confirm, but it'll save you a lot of money =)

Skill and gambling don't mix very well. Even if you could eliminate all cheating (which itself is an insanely hard problem), it just won't be very fun for people to play against pros. And even though there's very few pros, they will dominate the amount of played games (after all, they're the guys who can turn a profit).
The combination that seems to work for gambling is games that are ~99% luck with ~1% skill. Something like pocker or the original bustabit fit that.  The skill component is enough that if you're good you can turn a profit (over time), but small enough that anyone has a shot of just getting lucky.

On default settings and mempool size, there are currently 30 sat/byte transactions sitting in my mempool. (I'm the author of estimatefee.com ) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:10:08
It makes almost no difference. They're a merchant, which means they receive transactions not send them [1]. Segwit is only relevant when sending transactions.
The fees they're complaining about are that their customers need to pay. Even if their customers are using segwit wallets, the 30-50% savings you typically see aren't going to move any needles
[1] Yeah, it massively helps during consolidation. But this can be done at off-peak times, so the saving is not that much in absolute amounts.

I'm not going to pretend that 0-conf is safe, but this is retarded.
It seems like the author of this "exploit" never understand's bitcoins UTXO model, nor double-spends.
The "exploit" mentioned here is a simple transaction racing, which has been known about from the beginning of bitcoin. (And which there are even services that will detect for you)
@_date: 2018-09-28 03:30:16
Yeah, but it wouldn't be obvious that you were the one who created the transaction. Unless they ran an extensive spy network, they wouldn't even know you're one of the first nodes seen with that transaction.
And there's a fair bit of plausible deniability, (if you're a listening node) anyone could've connected to you and given you that transaction, and then your node broadcasted it. 
On a privacy scale of "terrible" to "fantastic" it's probably a "ok-ish"?
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:00:21
I don't think it's very comparable. Batching an optimization that large services can make to reduce their costs. But it's actively harmful for privacy and centralization (the larger you are, the more effective and less user-impact batch makes)

^ basically why it was removed.  The bonuses allowed for skillful playing by cashing out after other people (but before the bust). But since it was such a minor amount (1%) people tended to just ignore it, and play bustabit as if it was a 100% luck game. So after the changes Daniel's made, bustabit is now a lot better for *most* players -- but people who were interested in skill-gambling don't really have much other option than poker (or say sports betting) 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:30:59
Yeah, the new limit is 4M weight. 1 normal byte of a transaction = 4 weight. 1 byte in the "witness" of an address is 1 weight.
So the theoretical biggest block size would be a single transaction, with a single output and all the data stored in the witness. Obviously this isn't a realistic scenario, but it allows you to establish an upper bound.
If everyone stopped using legacy addresses, we'd have a more realistic block size of ~1.6-2MB though.

Hi there! Owner of MoneyPot here. First of all, I'd advise against using the MoneyPot depositor, as it works quite differently than you'd expect (it scans blocks, as opposed to using the account system in bitcoind).
As for your code, it's extremely vulnerable for double spends. The simple way to reduce this enormously is only accept transactions with 1 or 2 confirmation.
Also using mongo for this stuff is an absolutely *awful* choice, as someone who has worked with half a dozen different databases, I can say that this would be by far the absolutely last database I'd consider.
In your case what you do is insert into the `deposits` collection and increment the `users_balance`. In mongo there's four general outcomes:
a) Both fail
b) The user_balance gets increased, but the deposits doesn't get inserted
c) The deposit gets inserted, but the user_balance doesn't get increased
d) Both succeed
Case b) will manifest as on the second running, double crediting someone their deposit. Case c) will manifest as never crediting someone their deposit.
The only sane way to model this in mongo is by embedding the deposits in the user object, to use the document-level atomic operation. However it's just a terrible way to approach the problem, and a great way to lose money and customers.
As for the bitcoin side, you're missing handling two cases: transaction malleability and reorganisations. You can leverage bitcoind's handling of both of these by instead calling `listreceivedbyaddress` and processing the entire thing at once. This is effectively how big sites like just-dice.com work.
Precisely because of all the difficulty in dealing with the bitcoin side of things, is why we (at Money Pot) have started working on a new project:  which will allow third party apps to use our oauth system for logins and handling deposits and withdrawals and what not. We'd love to hear your usecase, and the operations you need supported
 
@_date: 2014-12-29 06:40:38
I run Money Pot and interested in anything that can help players privacy, so I'd be interested in something like this. However, this seems like a bit of a step backwards, if I'm understanding right. I would need to generate a stealth address per player (so I know whose deposit is whose ), which would mean that I need to check every network transaction against every  stealth address, with no hope of using indexes to speed it up? With enough players, this seems to be completely unfeasible.
I guess the alternative would be everyone pays to the same stealth address, but also encodes some extra information (e.g. their user id). However, this isn't really viable unless it's widely supported and standardized.
@_date: 2017-02-03 02:11:07
One way forward might to be create a minimal patchset to bitcoin that signals for such a compromise. That way people have something to actually run / mine with to show their support. You could have something like BIP-COMPROMISE (or what ever) which if activates is exactly like segwit but with additional difference that in a further 3 months later it orphans any blocks that aren't supporting BIP-COMPROMISE (to be sure all miners are upgraded) and then 3 months after that, it hardforks to a block weight of 8M (double what it is in segwit).
Ideally the patch set should be maintained against the latest stable release of bitcoin core, and master.
Something like that would be pretty easy to get behind, and I'd love to do so =)

I can not overstate how useful this feature is. The way it works is basically an encryption key, where you can generate an unlimited amount of wallets. I have several different passphrases on my trezor for different purposes.
For instance, if I went through airport security and they wanted me to unlock my trezor -- I can safely give them my day to day passphrase without compromising or revealing the presence of my cold storage one. 
A lot better than refusing to cooperate, and getting deported or thrown in a cell.

Sorry to hear about this. Threats like this can be pretty scary, no matter how empty they are. I run a bitcoin casino and have been given my fair share of death threats, even some with elaborate plots ("hi, I'm paid to kill you. But I don't really have any loyalty to my employer, so if you can beat his offer I'll let you live." type stuff.
Anyway, there's almost zero barrier to entry to sending stupid death threats (no ethics and a tor browser), so I really really wouldn't worry about it. Odds are it's a 14 year old kid thinking he can get rich or something.
I just sent some dust to that address, hopefully if the guy is stupid his wallet will automatically spend it and it might help de-anonymize him.
@_date: 2015-05-09 13:00:57
What about having two limits? One limit that constraints the UTXO set from growing more than X (say 100 KiB), and another constraint for the actual block size (say 30 MiB). Most full nodes won't need to store all blocks. And many normal transaction won't grow the UTXO  (e.g. they spend from 2 outputs, they spend to 2 outputs).
As an example, my bitcoin core wallet has received 34,980 transactions and sent 17,110 ... but yet:
    $ bitcoin-cli listunspent | grep amount | wc -l
    48
Which means, most of the time I make a spend I'm actually decreasing the UTXO set.  Because blocks will be primarily constrained by the UTXO growth limit, miners would select for ones that decrease the UTXO set, or require more fees from ones that increase it. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:34:00


Sorry, I meant to say the change address tends to be extremely determinable (yeah, because of amounts)


It certainly wouldn't be appropriate to be default behavior or anything. But I don't think having a "freeze" option or even a "delete" would be a UI problem, and even if users never directly use it -- some bitcoin services absolutely would, which trickles down to better privacy for everyone.
Especially with the awesome new HD wallet stuff, deleting addresses isn't as bad as it could be recovered from the seed.
Also I'm probably in the tiny minority here, but I actually like the privacy trade offs bitcoin makes.  I worry that if bitcoin embraced anonymity too much, it'd end up being too ripe of a target for regulators.  It's kind of cool now how people confuse regulators with stuff like: "bitcoin isn't anonymous, it's psuedo-anonymous!" yet if you take precautions, the privacy is pretty damn amazing.

I like coinbase too, but for what it's worth if you have advanced malware that targets coinbase, you're going to be pretty screwed with your funds there. Even 2fa isn't particularly helpful, as it can be replayed. (e.g. When logging in, the malware can feign there was a problem, and ask you to reenter the 2fa which they replay in order to do a withdrawal)
For non-technical users, I always strongly recommend using mobile wallets, especially mycelium for android and breadwallet for ios). Or if holding enough money, trezor is pretty great too.

Not really, nodes don't do that much for security. That's really miners job. Running a node is definitely a net positive as helps other people people sync and propagate transactions and blocks. It'd also make bitcoin a little more robust against a DoS type attack as there are more nodes that would need to be shut down.
However, the real purpose of running a node is it allows you to know which transactions are valid or not, without having to trust a third party. This is pretty important, as if there was a concerted effort to "trick" people, you'd not be one of them (e.g. if everyone used blockchain.info to verify transactions, bitcoin would just be a shitty version of paypal).
However, if there's an attack against bitcoin your node isn't really going to stop it or provide any defense or anything like that. If you really want to help secure bitcoin, probably the best way is buying a miner and pointing it at a pool you support.

Thanks for replying, it's was a really good post.
I don't want to waste too much of your time with my reply, but from what I've seen for a lot of people, possibly most, bitcoin is currently working pretty badly. Most of the blame for sure is on bad wallets or services (bad fee estimation, no fee bumping, no CPFP etc) which at the moment is pretty much *all* of them. And some of that pain is caused by the fee market (by nature) pricing user and use-cases out. 
For these people affected (and the businesses/people who support them) a block size increase seems like an awfully appealing short term solution until something like the lightning network or a "payments" sidechain is ready.
It's a shame that segwit is getting blocked for political reasons, but unless bitcoin suddenly dies, I think it's here to stay.  I hope all the crap and shit you've had to deal with hasn't jaded you too much. I really do think there's a reasonable and conservative way forward  =)
And thanks for all you've done for bitcoin!

I love your club analogy, it's pretty great.
Another example: if everyone agreed that bitcoin security without block subsidies suck and decided that the min block subsidy would be 1 BTC per block to protect the network.

While a positive outcome, they completely avoided the real issue here. It wasn't that they decided to change their license, it was the underhanded fashion they did it.

OP is definitely telling the truth. I run a popular bitcoin service, and get like 10 people a day outraged at me for not sending them money or "Faking" it, cause it's not on blockchain.info. 
In all cases, it's just blockchain.info being unreliable and the transactions are high fee (using core's estimatefee) and no bip125 or anything. I have a copy&amp;paste response to those people telling them about it, and that they should stop using blockchain.info, although to be honest I'd rather they just fix their service
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:56:16
Sure, it's not working badly for all users. I mean if you put a high fee, or use a wallet/service that does, then sure, you're not going to have any problems.
But for many, and possibly most users, that's not the case. And when they (or the wallet they use) puts too low of a fee, they're left in limbo and have no idea if they've lost their money or who to blame.
I think my business gets about 10+ support requests on average these days from people who have transfers stuck with the majority extremely confused and upset (most of the time they think it's the receiving parties responsibility to confirm the transaction, and upset I'm not doing that).
This I have no doubt is something that will improve a lot with better tooling, but right now it's a total mess

This is rather interesting, I'm not sure how I feel about it.
On one hand it's undeniably good if there's only a single (useable) chain going forward, and seems like an effective way to stop people losing money accidentally.
But using it in the case of a controversial hard fork, it seems awfully coercive and a "hard fork that fucks up the old chain via a softfork" probably gives miners a lot more control than anyone ever imagined.

And that's for a layer 3 attack, there's even a lot more available for layer 7..
(Of course, it's not a silver bullet or anything. But it can be extremely effective in combination with other techniques that try reduce the actual traffic before it hits your machine)
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:35:36
There's so much low-hanging fruit of how bitcoin fungibility can be improved without hard-forks, I'd find it hard to believe a radical change is appropriate now.
e.g. bitcoin core has a bug where it almost always makes a change address, and the change address tends to be extremely predictable. Investigative services have been able to trivially take advantage of this to cluster wallets, even ones that don't reuse addresses
Or there's no option in core to even disable reusing addresses (on a global or per address level), which means if someone is interested in knowing more about you they can (and do) spray dust at you and your wallet will happily "clean up" that dust in future transactions you make
Just to be clear, I'm not criticising as I haven't put in any work to fix the problems myself. I just think we should be careful jumping to the newest shiny technology when there's so much engineering work left.
@_date: 2016-03-16 18:47:49
You're defining "in the rules already" as anything that is allowed by a soft-fork. The rules right now allow X coins to be spent, but miners can collectively agree to softfork to stop X coins from spending them. That's *huge* rule-change (especially if you're the owner of X coins) and the only ones who vote on it are miners.
Miners could even decide on having a blacklist of banned coins (e.g. they could start with known-stollen coins) or have a white list  (e.g. if government regulation banned anonymous payments). Really the possibilities of things miners can vote on are almost endless.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:50:41
It sounds like this would be a lot easier for a miner to abuse by just purposely skipping a few high-fee transactions? That way clients assume they weren't in blocks as they didn't pay enough fees.
Sounds a lot cheaper than making hundreds of high fee transactions that probably another miner will end up finding
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:59:10


If they fill the block with dummy transactions, it means they can't use fast block propagation and would be significantly disadvantaged to the point it'd be better to wait until they validated the last block to get legitimate (pre-propagated) transactions.
That said, I don't like the idea of requiring blocks to have transactions. It adds complexity and provides incentives for spam

If you read the thread, you'll see that's not really the case. It's just a marketing trick. He's giving miners 110% of the block reward, but keeping transactions fees. But he's also expecting that transaction fees are going to be &gt; 10% of the block reward.

Not for any practical sense. See what a soft-fork is, and their almost limitless power when enforced.  Hell, if they have enough votes (hashes) they can even enforce rules without telling you what they are.
But for a practical example, let's say I vehemently disagree with segwit for some deranged reason, and want to not support it.  However if miners vote it in, I have absolutely choice but to go along with it. During the voting process I have absolutely no vote too. Only unless I update my node to hard-fork in a way that stops segwit, they've changed the rules without my consent!

I think you're being way too harsh. If the federation is made up of some trusted and independent entities, I think the security will be fine for small amounts of money.

@_date: 2017-03-18 21:38:46
I think it's slightly more nuanced than that. They view their "emergent consensus" as a long-term solution, and segwit as a small one-off capacity increase. By allowing segwit to go through, it'll take some fee pressure off the network, which is also the driving force of most "big blockers".

Yes, it's very very real. Take a quick look through my post history, and you'll see I'm pro-core and very much against EC.
However, I run a reasonably popular bitcoin service and probably average 200 tickets a week from people having problems with their transactions not confirming. Often these people have transactions stuck for days and are super frustrated. 
A disproportionate amount is caused by blockchain.info wallets (holy shit, they're bad). But it's a very very real problem, that wallets are handling extremely poorly at the moment (e.g. no fee bumping, no support for CPFP etc)
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:48:18
Security through obscurity absolutely works in some cases, and it's often under-appreciated. For instance if they quietly fixed the bug in the middle of another large change that no one cared about, it likely could pass through undetected. 
However forgetting the fact the cat is already out of the bag and it's being abused in the wild, making a closed source patch release is just insane. It's a reasonably straight forward task to do a diff of the disassembled version. 
If they were competent enough to have not already leaked the actual diff, it would've made a fun challenge.
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:46:42
Perhaps you need a later version of electrum? .0005 BTC/kB is unfortunately not enough fees at the present moment.
If you're aiming to have a transaction confirmed within 25 blocks (  ) you should be looking at ~0.00136119 which is almost triple that. Even more for faster conf :(
@_date: 2017-03-31 23:10:20
I consider myself somewhat of a big-block person, and yeah, I am rather frustrated at those blocking SegWit for political purposes.
However, I am rather sick of people blaming "network spammers". Bitcoin simply needs to handle use, and abuse far, far better. If users experience goes to shit (e.g. getting transactions stuck for hours/days) it's not the fault of spammers, it's the fault of bitcoin/wallets. Obviously spam (and high-network use in general ) will cause fees to increase, but we should make sure the damage is limited to that.
I also think fees are too damn high in general (why I support SegWit, 2nd layer solution and block size increases)
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:20:12


You'd be surprised. Especially when you look at people who use bitcoin for utility purposes (rather than philosophical). I run a gambling site, and have trouble convincing a lot of people to avoid keeping their funds on coinbase (and keep in mind that gambling is forbidden by coinbase ToS and you can get banned for doing it). Most of those people say they'd rather leave their coins there because it's a "big company" that they "can trust", as opposed to some app in the app store.
And if you go outside of the bitcoin space, most people have absolutely no problems keeping all their life savings in a single bank.
I'm not trying to say that it's good or bad, but I think you misunderstand the vast majority of users.

@_date: 2017-03-05 18:55:46


It's not as a common as I'd like it to be, but it's called CPFP.  
If you check estimatefee.com you can see a pretty good visualization of CPFP. Every time you see a low-fee transaction followed immediately by a high-fee one, you know the high fee one is paying for the low-fee one.


Not all, it's a pretty recent improvement in bitcoin core
If you check this:
You can see the difference between doing it, and not doing it.


There's a hard coded unconfirmed chain limit of 25, anything longer than that gets ignored.  But in theory your idea works. Although you'll have trouble getting the first 24 transactions accepted in the mempool without any fees, but it's doable

Mass confusion from users. Thousands of people losing money in replay attacks. Brand dilution.  Just the typical stuff if you have an ad hoc chain split
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:45:05


Yeah, but what the UASF does is says "We refuse to recognize any chain that is invalid by segwit rules, even if it has the most proof of work". 
 &gt; If what you write is true, why does everyone says we need a &gt; 51% of hashing power at all
The idea behind having &gt;51% of the hashing power is so that it can be done in a way that doesn't split the network in two. If the majority of hashing power supports segwit, then segwit will also be the chain with the most proof of work.
The UASF on the other hand is like "fuck it, we don't care if we split the network and have less PoW". 
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:04:59


This is an extremely hard coordination problem. How on earth do you do you do this? Using hash-power on the other hand is very easy for everyone to agree upon.
And in another thread, someone asked all the exchanges their stances. Every exchange that commented on a position said they would remain neutral in a blockchain fork and support both chains. I suspect this will be the course of action of every bitcoin business. It's pretty much like the "nothing at stake" problem. The local optimal for all bitcoin businesses and users is to support both chains, until it's decided which wins. 


"Upgrading their node to detect malicious blocks" = enforcing the soft fork. If they're enforcing the soft fork, it's a normal soft fork and the user-activated was a waste of everyones time.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:47:28


I think many exchanges are already on the record saying they'll be neutral on all forking matters and accept and trade both sides of the fork.
I say this as a bitcoin business owner on the segwit adoption list:  I think it's foolish to expect a bitcoin businesses to ever champion one side of the fork, when the cost of getting it wrong is absolutely insanely immense. It's probably enough to destroy my business. So if a UASF ever looks to be a thing, I'll make sure to operate on both sides of the chain.. (as I expect all other sane businesses to do)
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:01:46
That's rather wishful thinking. Just because someone supports BIP9-activated segwit does not imply support a UASF. Hell, AFAIK not even a *single* core developer has come out in favor of it.
Unless you can convince me that the overwhelming vast majority of the economy is willing to stick its neck out in a UASF, it's something I'm very much against. Probably the best way to do that is establish a future contracts that consistently show the risk of a chain split is negligible and/or have statements from all the major bitcoin businesses that they will be partisan and ignore the longest valid chain.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:17:39
The big issue with this approach is it doesn't offer miners a hard guarantee to miners. The point of the "bitcoin defense fund" is it holds money on both sides of the chain so it can guarantee that that mining on the old BTC chain is more profitable *even if* it loses. This is rather important to rerisk it for miners.
I mean, you can certainly do this in a decentralized way, but I think a centralized route is far more efficient and straight forward. The bitcoin ever is hit by "phase 3" of the attack and there isn't a very swift and rapid response -- the battle could be lost for ever. As soon as the original chain is "not working" people and miners will be in a hurry to switch somewhere functional, even if they don't fully agree.
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:03:47


AFAIK my site (probably the biggest bitcoin gambling site right now by volume) is the only one that has taken a position: 
I personally am very much in favor of segwit, but I strongly feel this is absolutely the wrong way to achieve it. I actually feel that there are no justifications for a UASF. If things have degraded to the point we can't trust and work with miners (which I don't feel like we're at yet) then we just need to hard fork away from them cleanly. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:10:47
A tutorial would be far better off showing how to accept payments with bitcoin core over rpc. It's not much harder, and it's going to be about 8000x more reliable than blockchain.info's API
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:12:33
I spent a few minutes thinking about this, and I actually can't think of a single case I would support a UASF.  If the situation has degraded so badly that we can't trust and work with miners, what is needed is a HF that replaces them with something we can trust (and the situation is rapidly decaying to the point that I'd even consider that on the table).
Although maybe I'm missing something obvious
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:36:15


Except they won't be "BU" they'll be normal BTC. Everyone who's playing by the old rules will be on that chain...
I'm personally a strong segwit supporter, but I have every intention on staying on the (valid) chain with the most work. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:41:41
I like this idea! My biggest concern with a big jump (e.g. 1MB -&gt; 2MB) isn't network capacity but the bitcoin ecosystem will get lazy again with-regards-to handling fee pressure, and then when the pressure comes back it'll be worse than ever (as we'll have more users).
Having 0.1 MB steps help alleviate these concerns of mine

I would suspect it's actually higher than this. My site (bustabit.com) did about 1.26 BTC/minute of volume in the month of  February. So that's around $1500/minute.

@_date: 2017-03-25 13:39:35


...and every single user that doesn't update to support a UASF or doesn't want to.
But by all means, if you want to do a UASF I have absolutely no objections. It's completely in your right, but you shouldn't expect users to join your fork unless your chain has the most work.
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:04:28
I absolutely agree. It might make it a little bit easier for people to abuse and spam, but as almost everyone already knows you can already trivially check for shadow-deletes and what not by opening the page in a new session.
I'm very pro bitcoin-core (I'm running at least 3 nodes, and have even paid for work on core) and segwit, and yet have had a couple of my posts here deleted and others sneakily "auto moderated" removed until they were old and the thread was dead before they were approved.
The whole experience leaves me with very little trust in this community, and I think a lot of the hard-handed policies here have either directly caused or exacerbated the divide in the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:59:17


How do you define "zero risk"? If the majority of miners aren't enforcing it, it is extremely possible that there is a chain split. The soft fork will cause enforcing users to ignore the chain that has the most work.
The UASF is ridiculously unsafe without majority of miners buying in (at which point, we can do a normal soft fork..) 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:23:52
Correct, but in practice you have already not been able to do free / high priority transactions for at least a year or so. It only works if miners make space in their block for them, which they used to do to bootstrap the bitcoin network, but those days are gone.
So now the code is basically useless complexity that serves no real purpose, so it's getting removed.
Actually one use-case I can think of, is that if someone forks bitcoin to create their own altcoins it would be nice to have this feature, so they can bootstrap the same way bitcoin did. However it wouldn't really make sense for this to be a priority of bitcoin core
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:45:44
Exchanges and bitcoin businesses aren't going to champion one side of the fork. There's simply too much money to lose if they get it wrong and no downside in supporting both.

FWIW Costa Rica doesn't offer gambling licenses, they just don't regulate offering gambling to overseas players.


Yeah, theres a lot of really shitty and shady operators. But funnily enough they're mainly the "traditional" casinos that accept bitcoin. If you look at the established provably fair bitcoin casinos things have been amazingly self regulating.
There's definitely a lot of irony though in you complaining about it being a grey industry, when your website heavily promotes these "grey" sites (as they offer big affiliate programs) in place of more reputable ones (that might not have an affiliate program)

I actually sell copies of bustabit source code (node.js and postgres) for 2 BTC with the only condition you don't redistribute it.

@_date: 2019-03-07 16:56:28


Yeah, I've achieved rates of &gt;80% no-change transactions with coinsayer.com on a commercial basis. It's worth noting that there's two things that contribute to this:
a) The wallet typically will have over a couple thousand utxo's to spend from. Which in end-user settings is not very ideal
b) In addition to instant payments, when ever making payments, the wallet has a queue of pending payments that can be made at the same time (partial batching). Although from a block-explorer point of view, it'll look like the transaction has change (but in reality is actually another payment)
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:03:22


Yeah, it reminds me of the "nothing at stake" problem. As a bitcoin business, why would I support 1 of 2 forks, where if I pick the wrong one I (and my customers) are totally screwed. The sensible thing would be to just support both, and not have to worry about it. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 00:39:01
From a high-level point of view, I think the point of having prominent privacy warnings is a sort of "name and shame" bad practices. So drawing attention to UIH transactions when wallet (including core) will create UIH transactions is pretty silly and just contributes to people ignoring warnings cause they're full of noise.


I agree with that. But I have a transaction with 2 outputs, where one has 5 significant digits and the other has 6 significant digits -- and blockstream.info is giving a red error about "Round payment amount". I wasn't intentionally sending a round amount, so imho that's just a false positive.
I opened an issue here for it:   as reddit kind of sucks for this sort of discussion.
@_date: 2017-03-09 03:41:56


That's completely not true, the key is never generated by or exposed to the computer even during initialization.

    $ bitcoin-cli estimatefee 2

Which worries me a lot. As blocks fill up and we move towards more of a fee market -- if the fee estimation logic is too aggressive things to could spin into a big mess

Or they could soft fork. Miners absolutely are the ones voting, it's rather disingenuous to say otherwise.
Or ctrl+f the bitcoin whitepaper for "vote", it lays it out pretty clearly
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:28:29


No, there's been times that the required fees have literally doubled in minutes. And times that people who have used bitcoin cores 2 estimation have been stuck for a long time. (But it happens very infrequently, and there is a very narrow window that it happens). I run the informational service estimatefee.com, I'm pretty well aware of how it works =)
Trying to solve the problem purely with fee estimation is just not enough. I think really the ideal way is low-balling it, and continual fee bumping.  
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:43:53




I wouldn't try "settle" with miners until things calmed down, and it was clear how the best way to pay them is. Just the fund has enough money on both sides of the chain to guarantee payments.
The only time it would be necessary to pay miners on the "attack chain" would be if the defense runs out of money and the 51% attack succeeds. Then the fund would pay out there.
(Yes, that outcome would suck for everyone. But I think it's extremely important to have, so that miners don't bare the risk of the BTC chain losing. All miners that participated in the unsuccessful defense of bitcoin would be paid equiv if they had originally switched to the attack chain in the first place ) 
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:11:54
Yeah, that's why even as a big segwit proponent, I am strongly against it. The benefits of segwit are much less than the risks of a network split
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:16:29


If there is no coordinated defense to a 51% attack, things could go south very very fast. Users will be quick to switch if they're presented with: "Do nothing anduse a chain that doesn't work or switch and carry on like normal". And commercial miners aren't going to want to burn electricity if their block is going to be orphaned anyway.
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:22:48
Except they're not. Sending exact amounts (no change) is not (always) a "privacy gotcha", but often a sign of very optimized coin-selection which not only saves on-chain resources but makes wallet clustering very difficult. Same goes for the "unnecessary input heuristic", there was a big discussion on the mailing list with it regarding P2EP but I believe the take away should be that it's best to just write coin selection in a UIH oblivious manner.
I'm also not a fan of pointing out "round payment amounts" as I designed my code to intentionally pick round amounts for change. So there's another false-positive.
Pointing out address re-use is good though.
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:20:22
Heh, requiring someone to lose billions of dollars to destroy bitcoin seems like a pretty strong security model. I can think of a number of much cheaper ways to do that right now (like start and subsidize such a large-scale mining operation that margins for all commercial mining competitors is &lt; 0). 
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:49:06


I am not the OP, and probably have unconventional views. But I personally think the weight it's a very good and important thing (and if anything doesn't go far enough). I believe that the future of bitcoin is that "everyone" who runs a full node just runs a pruned node. Having the full history is something for a specialist archival service, but not the common case.
Under this modal, what really matters is size of the utxo. It should be expensive to bloat the utxo, and you should be incentivized to clean it up. I'd even like a model with negative weights (e.g. for every byte you remove from the utxo you get -99 weight. For every byte you add to the utxo is 100 weight. For every other byte is 1 weight. Although this plays havoc with transaction selection if you want to cap the block size in bytes)
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:35:31
Seems like an easy fix though. Currently the consensus rules ban any transaction &gt; 1MB (by the very fact it wouldn't fit in a block). That could easily be made an explicit rule going forward (for non-segwit style transaction) for even if the block size is bigger. And the 100KB "standard" transaction network rule would still stay, so I can't imagine there's a real issue here. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:11:21
It's not just exchanges that feel this way. I brought it up much earlier (as quite possibly the most popular bitcoin gambling business right now):
And their response was complete dismissal. I'm all on board with aggressive time frames (and can probably deal fine with 72 hours warning), but have a block randomly trigger a fork with no relay protection is so stupid that it's either malicious or betrays a total lack of understand of how the bitcoin ecosystem functions.
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:57:04
Please just ignore it. I just posted something similar on r/btc (due to some of the attacks they were getting) too, but the gist is there are retards on both sides of the fence, and it's likely some of these attacks are even false-flag.
Do not allow yourself to be influenced by this stupid shit either way or you're just setting yourself up to be easily manipulated.

Yeah, for sure. If blocks were unlimited in size, then CPFP is pretty much useless as you can just put all transactions in the block. If the chart continued far enough, you'd see they both end up equally exactly the same.
However if there's fee pressure (which I personally think is a good thing, at least in moderation) then CPFP is a pretty important feature

They are generally a non-custodial wallet, although there are exceptions such as my old ass wallet (with 0.1 btc) they know 2-of-2 keys and refuse to release my funds. (I actually had several conversations with them about this, and they were happy to specifically blacklist my wallet but now argue they don't want to make exceptions to their policy to give me back my funds despite them now having custodial control of it. Because I'm not in the US (and lazy) I haven't sued them over it, despite someone who was on their staff recommending that course of action)
Anyway, they're pretty much a garbage tier wallet with the multisig setup only done to benefit them by allowing them to charge for services.  I'd never touch the wallet again with a 10 foot pole.

However in the situation you described -- it sounds like the miners have become so dysfunctional and disconnected from the bitcoin economy that forcing a change via a UASF is just a bandaid. If you're going to risk splitting the network, you might as well get rid of the problem all together. And in that situation I would support a change of proof-of-work or even a switch to proof-of-stake.
I think fortunately though, that the situation hasn't nearly got that bad.

Without rigorously defining what make something "pure" it's quite difficult. If a "fiat bridge" isn't pure, then you could also argue that the dark net markets for instance are a "drug bridge" and also not pure.
Regarding gambling, it's worth noting the two largest crypto gambling sites (primedice.com and bustabit.com) are "pure" in the sense they only accept and withdraw bitcoin, unlike a lot of the rivals that accept every coin under the sun.

I really wish we didn't promote such a us-vs-them mentality. I mean your entire comment dismisses the "opposition" as a bunch of trolls who don't even have btc. I for one would strongly support a blocksize increase although I do value consensus foremost.
(On a side-note: I moved some bitcoin on my trezor to prove I'm not a shill, but even after a few minutes I can't sign a message :/   I guess signing messages is still not mainstream)

Really nice work. It's quickly become my favorite block explorer. However, I'd strongly recommending removing or hiding the privacy recommendations. I tried it with a half a dozen of transactions I had, and it was just full of alarming false-positives that will be interpreted by non-experts into thinking there's an issue. 
Edit: The ETA looks wrong too. I have a transaction that's 1.0 vMB "away from tip" and it's showing an ETA of 144 blocks, which is pretty unlikely. The ETA should probably be decided based on 50% confidence or so.

I'm actually quite a fan of a federated sidechain. For a lot (and I daresay most) transactions it makes sense to trade-off security for convenience. Done right, I think a federated sidechain is actually quite a good choice for things like "buying coffee".
That said, I'm a bit confused about liquid. From the website it says:


Which is extremely disappointing unless it's only referring to the federated block signers. I feel a far better business model would be to monetize (the tiny) transaction fees, and push for mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:16:56
What does "exchange-level" participants mean?
As an "end-user" can I send and receive liquid directly, without paying fees (other than network fees) and without getting permission? And then by extension if I'm a business, and I want to accept and receive liquid (on behalf of my customers) can I do so without subscription fees? And by extension, what if my business is an exchange? 
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:04:08
If so, then that's awesome (assuming it's totally open for anyone to participate for everything other than block signing).  Would really like to see this get clarified
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:07:50
Well, the "indefinitely" part is probably a lot cheaper than you imagine. 
If you did manage a 51% attack, (say orphaning all blocks that aren't yours and mining empty blocks) you wouldn't have to wait long until all serious mining farms powered off their equipment.
You really just you just need to privately mine a few blocks ahead of the network, when ever someone mines a block you just dump two of yours and orphan them. Then as miners stop wasting electricity mining, you can also ramp down the expense too.
@_date: 2017-01-31 21:47:29




I think you may be misunderstanding tragedy of the commons. It's not in the self interest of the shepherds to allow other shepherds to add more to the flock. So they don't agree upon it. There is not 95% consensus required. The commons doesn't get over-grazed.
Of course, that doesn't imply that "95% consensus" is the best solution or anything, but it certainly isn't a tragedy of commons. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:46:15
The biggest other offender seems to be coins.ph (or something like that). I think it's some Philippine exchange or something that always sends transactions with extremely low fee rates, and I have to deal with their annoyed users.
But it's also other wallets too, people often will pick "low" for their fee, but then when it doesn't confirm in a few hours are fed up or confused. Or there's other situational times, like when you send a transaction just *before* a big mempool build up, the fees used will be pretty low and transactions get stuck.
FWIW thee's been times that even bitcoin core has had transactions with default settings (estimatefee 2) being stuck for ~10 hours.
Of course if you hear people complaining, then try to "reproduce" it with the same wallets you won't have the same thing happen. (as it'll adjust the feerate pretty fast).
I daresay, *every single* wallet (and service) needs to support re-prioritizing transactions. Just picking a good feerate is a fools game that will lead to you overpaying the vast majority of time, and getting stuck rarely.
@_date: 2017-01-31 21:32:34


For the value to change, there must be 95% agreement. This almost by definition means there's no tragedy of the commons problem (at least compared to something to situation where each miner can pick their own blocksize)

Cool to see progress on the front. I do though wonder if Luke Dashjr is intentionally creating drama:


already considered by many to be too large;
I don't want to be too harsh, as it seems like he's gone to a lot of work on this but I think in reality the main (or only?) real reason segwit is controversial is people think it's too conservative and will preclude further capacity increases for a while if it's passed.
"bip blksize" trying to lower the block weight over what would be possible compared to a soft fork, I think pretty much makes it totally dead on arrival and does not look like much of a compromise :(
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:52:06
I think we have:
* Preference from developers: clearly against
* Preference from hash power: clearly segwit2x
* Preference from coin holders: clearly segwit2x  (see or participate at vote.bitcoin.com)
* Preference from businesses: clearly segwit2x (see coin.dance)
My personal favorite would be if we have a futures market though. But either way, I don't think segwit2x has a consensus due to a lot of prominent disagreements.

It could, but it probably won't. Both Liquid and RSK seem to be compromised their designs by the (understandable) desire to monetize it. RSK has some shitty ICO crap, and liquid appears to require subscription fees (at least according to the FAQ)?
If it's not an open system (with the exception of a closed group of block-signers) .. then there's no way it's going to be able to compete with altcoins. If it's an open system (i.e. you don't need permission of pay fees to directly participate) then I think it actually stands a really good shot.

Interestingly the $3.46 appears to be subsidized by coinbase. The transaction itself was made using $5.70 in fees. 
The future is pretty bright: In a couple hours a lot of the bitcoin miners will return to bitcoin (after the BCC difficulty drop), and segwit fully activated and safe to use within a couple of days and then segwit2x to look foward to.

These posts are intentionally misleading, having the exact same transaction confirm yesterday would've cost almost $4.

Man, it really makes you wonder why they bother.
 I run a bitcoin casino, and offer a sizable bounty for any serious security issues, and dealt with similar shit half a dozen times.
People come forward with an "issue" but say they don't trust me and want to use escrow (or often willing to accept a fraction of the bounty if I send first, lol). Using an escrow is fine by me, but so far it's just a big waste of everyones time. Either they come up dry, or with something totally retarded. I sometimes really don't get people. 
I think going in the future, it'd be smart to not get escrows involved unless they've somehow shown themselves to be credible in the first place.

Sometimes it's pretty hard to differentiate a scam from someone with some pretty bad misunderstandings. Especially when they're entering a field they don't know, and hoping to educate themselves as they go. I recently had someone pitch something like this to me. They were (planning on) using bitcoin futures (but not bitcoin) to do cross border payments. Somehow he had convinced himself and a small team that it would have all these magical money making properties for both the sender, buyer and of course free time value interest!
At first I just assumed he was pulling an "obvious" scam, but I spent a few hours with him and worked some realistic numbers on paper and how it would work exactly and was rather genuinely shocked it didn't work out like he thought. And from what I see, has pivoted into something a bit different now
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:20:01


There are obviously lots of people who the fees have very minimal impact, like if I was just a bitcoin investor/speculator I'd be planning on making 2-transactions in my life and wouldn't care if they were each $25. 
But I run a pretty popular service, and have seen how the fees directly affect users to the point that the overwhelming majority of my users in some poorer places have been completely priced out.




I'm sure they will in time. I did some simulations on my services traffic, and will save about 20% by switching to segwit transactions (including for change). It'll probably take me a couple weeks to roll that out, and no doubt the bigger players will be a bit slower.  (Also funnily enough the worse your coin selection / consolidation is, the bigger savings you'll get from segwit) 
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:13:41
Is it one byte or two?

Russell is definitely one of the sanest people in the space, I don't think I've ever been able to issue with anything he's said. And what he presents here is definitely a reasonable way forward, and I very much hope consensus around that starts to build. 
However, this "debate" has been going on for *years* and has come at a big cost to bitcoin's usability and adoption. 
I really think we need immediate action, even if it's a stupid kick-the-can down the road block-weight doubling. I'll be the first to admit it's shitty precedent and how things shouldn't work in the future, but transaction fees are really at a breaking point while the network is crazily under-utilized.

The funny thing is, I actually learnt about the coin-voting site from you (back before it was hosted on bitcoin.com).


Unlike the KYC poll, you don't actually need to deanonymize yourself. You just vote for a position by signing from an address. (Personally I used a VPN to make sure to not associate even my ip address with my bitcoin address).


No it's not. Me and all the other segwit2x supporters I know of were very happy to dump our bitcoin cash. I personally have absolutely 0 left.


Surely you don't think is a good idea. And the whole idea of 1 warm body = 1 vote is rather antithetical to bitcoin itself.

I'm not sure it's so black and white. I'll bet you when this ICO bubble pops, people will start understanding what the motivation for the "accredited investor" class was.
I think though, it's really the law that needs to change. Deciding if someone is smart enough to see through scams by their networth might perhaps make a reasonable first-order approximation, but I think a sort of exam/certification would make more sense (something that went through the history of scams, bubbles, ponzis, pyramids and how money can't be created risk free, and understanding the kelly criteria etc.)

So you might want to do your own research (I recommend looking through bitcointalk's gambling section:  )

I'm pretty heavily involved in the bitcoin gambling scene; and I'd strongly encourage everyone to avoid this.


Casino bankroll investing was pioneered by just-dice.com around 4 years ago, and makes a lot of sense. Basically investors take the variance risk in exchange for some/most of the EV. With traditional bankroll investing, if players win (which happens often) the investors lose.
But promising (fixed) interest, means that if gamblers win money -- they still need to pay the gamblers *and* pay interest to the investors. Strictly speaking this *increases* the house risk, not decreases. The only way this is "sustainable" is if the casino fractional reserves and hopes that by the time investors want to withdraw they have made enough. 
But this is playing with fire, and you'll probably get burnt. I would encourage people to avoid playing or investing in any casino that flirts with insolvency hoping it all works out.
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:17:59
A large backlog doesn't mean someone is attacking bitcoin. A quick look at trade block, and there doesn't seem to be a spike in tx/sec, which probably means the backlog is caused by miners getting unlucky and finding few blocks.
But it's definitely easier to call it a spam attack, then acknowledge the horrible experience that bitcoin users are suffering is the new normal. 
Also this is pretty easy to verify:
Notice how the estimated hash rate (especially the 504 one) has plunged. That variance is what's responsible for the backlog. But if there really was someone who did want to attack bitcoin with spam, times like this would be the opportune moment. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 16:24:26
On a side note, this is why it's so important for the community to switch to "bits" (millionths of a bitcoin). I've on boarded hundreds of new bitcoin users, and one of the two biggest obstacles is the huge unit. Even once people realize you can have fractions of a bitcoin it's just downright awkward to deal with. $1 USD = 0.0014 BTC, which is something people struggle a lot with. However, $1 USD = 1340 bits is just a lot easier for people to get their head around.

You do realize, that it is currently extremely difficult (unless you have miner collusion) to double spend 0-conf funds (assuming the transaction has enough fees, and is not bip125)? Merchants take advantage of that to offer customers a far better user-experience. It might not be that for ever, but that's how it currently is. 
It might not be sustainable forever, but we certainly shouldn't intentionally undermine it. It reminds me a bit of throwing a brick through someones window because "windows aren't perfectly secure" or some crap
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:33:25


A lot. Well over &gt;2 months of engineering time just on minimizing fees in the form of custom coin selection, written in minizinc to minimze fees.
With my coin selection I can avoid creating change around &gt;25% of the time, vs 1 in ~hundred thousand with bitcoin core.
Actually batching itself doesn't really give you much, you save the fixed cost of a transaction (10 bytes, now 12 with segwit) and the cost of creating change (and the future cost of consolidating it). But a service like mine gets about 2 deposits for every 1 withdrawal, so really the most important thing is off-peak time consolidation. It's pretty painful though, as the off-peak tends to only be weekends, so I end up needing to keep several hundred bitcoin as float until then. Kind of a needless risk, just to save on fees.
I actually take batching further than anyone (AFAIK) where my coin selection also considers the pending transactions, and selects suitable ones. This allows me to pick ideal batches such that I can avoid the costs of creating change.
To be honest I'm a bit bitter about the whole thing. The cost of hosting a node for me is $2.50/month (paid yearly) on alibaba cloud, which is like half of what an average transaction fee is. To avoid bleeding money, I've needed to spend a lot of time on fee optimization and even hiring an expert with constraint solving (it's far from my field).  The whole thing is so insanely premature, and really quite stifling. And the saddest part it's all political. I have trouble believing anyone has legitimate technical concerns about an 8M block weight cap.

51% of miners could right now create a hard fork that allows them to steal all your coins. However, it doesn't really matter except to light clients because the rest of the network would reject it. 
Rolling back a soft fork is pretty much exactly the same, except there might be a few abandoned nodes that haven't upgraded and accept the roll back, but it's rather irrelevant.  Once segwit locks in, every node doing economic activity is going to upgrade to avoid becoming a virtual light client.

Now you're playing pedant. If a merchant waits a few seconds to make sure the transaction has fully propagated, there's no conflicting transactions and has sufficient fees to get mined (something companies like blockcypher have made incredibly easy to do) then it's currently virtually impossible to double spend (until miners change their policy at least).
None of this is theoretical, it's how bitcoin is actually being used today.
@_date: 2016-12-05 05:51:37
Using CPFP wouldn't really use much additional block space. At least in my case, I'm making a few dozen transactions per hour *anyway*, so I could easily use one of them to prioritize the stuck ones. One small disadvantage would be less than optimal coin selection, but the real annoyance is if a transaction doesn't have a change output there's no way to pull from it. I guess your wallet can always make sure to use change, but then you suffer make the coin selection slightly worse as well.

Well, if someone was spam attacking the network, you'd expect to see a spike in transaction.


Yeah, it's probably just typical variance. But it could even be some miners shutting down their equipment after the last huge difficulty increase. Who knows? But it's surely not malicious and rather normal
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:22:20


I agree it's not ideal due to the mismatch in incentives, however under my proposal it would require 95% of hashing power to me malicious, or at the very least reckless. Although considerable, I think it's a reasonable risk. Especially when the alternative is perhaps years of infighting and stalling. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:11:20


Well since the last difficulty adjustment, we've seen a reasonable drop in hash rate so if you compare the throughput of &lt;just before readjustment&gt;  to &lt;just after readjustment&gt; that's like a, what, 15% difference in throughput?  So it's not unexpected that this would drive up fees, and seems pretty reasonable that driving up the fees will mean different types of transactions will make it, and different types will get stuck, which would easily explains the clear change in transaction behaviors.
A great example of this, is I for instance haven't cleaned up my wallet because I'm waiting for (or hoping for) the fee rates to drop a bit. Once it does, I've got ~1-2k unspent outputs I can combine
This place is starting to remind me of and where instead of taking responsibility everything bad is blamed on the "bitcoin maximalists" or "small blockists". But here it's spam attacks and Roger Ver.

They're definitely legitimate users having problems, I run one of the biggest bitcoin casinos and in the last ~48 hours we've had a little over 50 support tickets of people who have deposits stuck in unconfirmed limbo. The vast majority of users are completely clueless to the cause, and not sure who to blame or how it can be fixed or what they can do next time to avoid it happening.
Hop on the chat of any of the casinos (like bustabit or primedice) and you'll see the same theme playing out. Literally a minutes ago:
19:37 khash: People r just spamming my txn is still unconfirmed after 15 hours don't know how long it will take ?
I really think two things are playing out right now. 1. Bitcoin is too easy to DoS. I'm no mathematician but having full blocks makes this exponentially easier as it forces legitimate users to try prioritize their transactions in front of your spam, thus saving you money, and costing them. 2. the tooling/ecosystem around it is not yet ready to handle this gracefully (e.g. reprioritizing transactions, child pays for children etc)
I by no means think this will kill bitcoin, but it's sure as hell a big setback. Everyone I've talked to who runs a bitcoin business (as in, accepts and sends bitcoin from customers) seems to have similar thoughts.

Transaction fees may not be personally impacting you, but that doesn't mean too much.
I deal with probably at least 20 people a day who are having issues because of either too high transaction fees, or them being too volatile. And in the last 30 days, I've spent $2902.76 USD on transaction fees.  While I'm in the fortune position of being able to consider that a business expense, it's absolutely adding a very considerable amount of friction to my business and making for less happy customers (most of that money would ideally be in their pockets).
Also, "I use wallets that calculate fees properly" is annoyingly dismissive. You'd be better off saying: "I can afford to pay more, and price other people out". And I accept that, it's how the fee market works. But for certain people, and certain use cases the difference between $0.05 and $0.25 in fees is absolutely huge.
As people like pointing out, there may be infinite demand for free transactions -- but that doesn't mean we should just throw in the towel. We should be looking how we can get the most amount of people and transactions we can *safely* have on bitcoin, even if that involves putting a bit of stress on the network itself.

Except it's useless to do so unless you've set your own client seed. If you know my client seed will be X, then you can brute force and find a server seed that you know will return really shitty results (for the first new nonce).
For the provably fair to work, you need to commit to a server seed and then allow the client to pick a server seed after.  However, when you create a lightning invoice you are generating a "preimage" ... so you might as well use that as the server seed.

Rolling back a soft-fork is actually a hard fork. That is actually central to the security model of something like segwit. 
By the time segwit activates, it's expected the vast majority of the network will be validating it, and all miners using it. So the fact that a very small subset of nodes won't notice a rollback is kind of irrelevant. 
(That said, I have no concerns about segwit. But czr5014's point is valid)
@_date: 2016-12-05 04:22:52
I didn't mean to imply I support viabtc or their service. I just don't like when people spread lies just because they dislike it.
But anyway, I think the main use case for it is not for intentionally sending transactions with low fees. But rather for when people mispredict the correct transaction fee, which is happening to every single wallet right now. And very few wallets that make it easy to reprioritize the transaction with CPFP or RBF, so it's definitely quite useful right now.
It's probably a bad thing for bitcoin and decentralization, but I suspect things like this will be gaining popularity in the future. For instance, I run a bitcoin service that pays ~2-3x what is generally required to do withdrawals, so I know they go through fast. However, if I could do a deal with a miner(s) where I could first send the transaction with a normal fee, if it gets mined, great! If it doesn't within an hour, I pay them (off chain) to include it in the next blocks. It'd probably save me ~$10/day
Of course, the better solution would be if reprioritizing with CPFP, but it would be a much more complex and not as robust (CPFP only works if you have an to pull from). And RBF isn't really great either, as an anti-DoS thing you generally need to double your transaction fee, which is generally too course 
@_date: 2016-11-11 21:33:40
I don't think this is a real problem, miners already disconnect them from open internet to prevent this.

While I support segwit, I think this would set a pretty terrible precedent. It'd be a lot more tasteful to buy a miner and mine on a pool that supports segwit. You'll probably over all have trouble paying off the cost of the miner if you're paying normal electricity rates, but you'll helping mine segwit blocks and giving your business to a pool that supports segwit. =)
@_date: 2016-12-24 14:15:52


Yeah, as it allows an attacker who is interested in who owns a certain address to keep dusting it and seeing how it gets spent-linked.
I really wish bitcoin core had a way to prevent this, even if it was as simple as allowing you to remove an address from the wallet or mark it as read only.
@_date: 2016-12-03 14:40:52
I consider myself a big blocker.
I think the bitcoin core team is very capable and intelligent, and I tend to agree with almost everything they say on a technical level. I just however think they are too conservative in their conclusions, and rather that we put a (bounded) amount of extra stress on the network in order to support more users / cheaper transactions / more DoS resistance. Even if we can for now only achieve a constant-factor improvement, and kick the can down the road, I'm more than happy with that.
And I think right now the bigger issue is politics and (both sides) are fighting to set precedent, instead of working in good faith to actual solve the problems.

It's worth noting that they use bitpay to process payments, so that's actually their cost. I actually think it's a great thing when services directly charge the customer the particular payment costs (e.g. like a lot of casinos) as it helps incentivizes consumers to pick the most efficient solution.
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:46:04
BTW the provably fair thing looks flawed. I can't change my client-seed, and when the server is generating a server seed it is done after it knows the client seed (which defeats the whole purpose of a client seed).
If I were you I would use something a bit more clever, like the lightning payment secret numbers as the server/client seeds
@_date: 2016-11-22 18:23:17
I use bitcoin core, for processing all deposits and withdrawals ;D
I just make a lot more transactions than you, so I'm a lot more likely to run into problems. (Although bitcoin core tends to avoid them in general, by being ridiculously aggressive in the amount of fees it pays (typically x2-x3 most other 95% confidence estimates)). 
The issue isn't me personally, I have written my own custom scripts to do CPFP to boost the priority of transactions. I'm more talking about normal users who use common wallets and are part of the now 60k transactions that are stuck
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:37:02

@_date: 2016-11-27 17:36:09
It needs to meet the rules. The trick is making sure that the RBF transaction doesn't just have higher fees, but it has enough fees to pay for the transaction it's replacing. So you need &gt;2x the fees (assuming the same tx size)
@_date: 2016-11-27 01:18:15
Under normal circumstances if I'm paying someone and there's a big chain reorganization it's really not going to matter as my transaction will appear on both branches.
However, if some of the transactions were sourcing fresh coinbase transactions, they would be completely invalid, and disappear. So it makes a lot of sense to not allow the coins to move until they're deeply secure.
The same would apply if there's a short lived accidental hard fork or what not.
@_date: 2016-12-03 23:50:25
Quite a well written article, and makes a strong case against "pure" on chain scaling. I do think most people would agree that bitcoin is not suitable to process every transaction in the world, and that for bitcoin to become mass-market off-chain transactions absolutely need to happen.
However, I don't think that's an argument against raising the block size. While it's not going to fundamentally change any scaling factors, there is absolutely a lot of benefit if we can agree on reasonable and safe capacity improvement (of which, segwit is certainly one).  
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:49:48
Cool story. However the issue is not that no transactions are confirming, it's that only a subset of them are. There are a lot of users right now, who are totally confused to why their transactions aren't going through, and pretty much every wallet (including bitcoin core) doesn't give them the option of bumping fees, so they're told "Sorry, just wait a day and see what happens"
@_date: 2016-11-22 18:07:35
And what wallet is it that you recommend that allow's users to reprioritize their transactions after they get stuck and otherwise deal with the congestion problems?
When pretty much every single wallet I've heard of suffers this problem, including bitcoin core itself, blaming users and telling them to switch wallets is disingenuous. 
(And yes, we know you got your transaction though. Congratulations. But you probably sent it after the surge in backlog, when the estimate fees were higher. )
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:05:18


It's not even extreme, it's reckless abandon.
I really do like core, segwit and am excited about off chain networks but whole block limits absolutely need a hike. It's already causing users and businesses a lot of of unnecessary pain, and I fear the longer we delay it the more divided and bitter our community will get.
I was already all aboard the r/btc train, before they want full retard pushing a broken-by-design BU, and now spitefully trying to block segwit
May I suggest we double the block limits 6 months after segwit activates? Let's give everyone something to rally behind =)
@_date: 2016-12-04 01:51:11


I think you might be fighting a straw man, or at least just some vocal idiots. I very much desperately want bigger blocks, but I do think "full blocks" is a good thing. (Although, actually I suspect they wouldn't be as important if bitcoin-ng was a thing).


Sure, absolutely. Current wallets (including bitcoin core) are handling the full blocks absolutely terribly right now. At the very least there needs to be easy and robust ways to reprioritize transactions which CPFP provides an elegant solution for (assuming you have change to pull from). RBF is also okish, but it's pretty messy and annoyingly generally requires you more than double the fees to bump :/
But while making efficient use of the available capacity is (very) important, I think it would be incredibly short sightly to solely focus on that. Increasing capacity to what we can safely tolerate, is imo, just as important.
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:18:55
A slight over-simplification, to avoid selfish mining complications:
There's no incentives for a miner to fill a block with spam transactions, as they'd just be paying themselves at the expense of having a slower to propagate block.
If they wanted to increase bitcoin fees (for other miners) they would be better off just mining empty/emptier blocks.
@_date: 2016-12-03 20:26:33

It doesn't impact any network fee predictors that I'm aware of. They don't look at the fees of transactions in a block, rather they look at the transactions that were in your mempool and NOT confirmed and know those were too low.

@_date: 2016-11-27 01:08:25
Pretty much, but not exactly.
Let's say you want to send some $AMOUNT  first send yourself ($AMOUNT + $LARGE_FEE)  with a tiny amount of transaction fees (you might be able to use 0, but I can't remember). Then source that output, to pay your actual target $AMOUNT. Then for good measure rebroadcast your original transaction.
Now only miners who use CPFP will mine your transaction, which is bitcoin core 0.13.0 and above. Miners that are using BU or old version of core won't get your transaction fees.

"turns into a paid service" is pretty blatant misinformation. They're still offering the service for free, they just increased the minimum fee rate of transactions they will bump, which is not only completely reasonable it's the sensible thing to do to prevent it being abused.
@_date: 2016-11-22 18:56:13
Another option, is have a "boost transaction" send, which when you send, sources all unconfirmed outputs in your wallet and ensures the entire virtual size/fee matches the current recommended fee.  So if you have stuck transactions, you just need make a new transaction and boost all your previous ones.
The benefit of this, is if you were going to make another transaction *anyway* it has very little costs.

It might have changed, but it used to always be multisig. I understand they've done that to monetize a service they offer of promising no double spends (since they control 1 of the keys, they can promise merchants they won't sign a double spend).
But yeah, it does create a permisioned dynamic, and it's a retarded wallet that I strongly recommend everyone avoid. (To be fair, they were offering time-locked transactions to get your funds out. But the problem is they get invalidated after every time you use the wallet due to bitcoin's utxo model. So it's not really practical)

This is total nonsense. I speak from experience, as the former owner of one bitcoins larger casinos (bustabit) -- and having invested thousands of hours in working to protect users privacy -- I can tell you it's no easy feat. Even with dozens of individual mitigations (even going as far as custom coin selection, transaction creation and relay code,) services like chainalysis have had pretty decent accuracy in identifying them. (The only real technique I found to really move the needle I have published as a standard: bip79 but it requires wallets to support, which unfortunately is pretty lacking).
It's a *huge* investment that requires hiring bitcoin experts to move bitcoin privacy from terrible to bad, such that unfortunately very few businesses currently see a business case in doing.

I've not seen core blaming anyone. Honestly, I think the slow adoption is in large part due to core's lack of support in their wallet (lots and lots of businesses use their wallet under the hood). 
But it's coming, soon.
As someone who has actually first-hand added segwit support to a productionize site -- I can say it can be a bit of a pain in the ass and scary to do so. But no worse than half the other things production sites need to do when dealing with money.
Sometimes we get a bit impatient, and forget that when you look at the big picture a bit of delay is not really a big deal. The important thing it's really an unequivocally better way of doing things.

I think you just don't understand how the mempool works. About 5MB of those transactions paying &lt;10 sat/byte are mine. The reason I have so much is I need to defragment my hot wallet, and the reason I am paying so little is because I don't really care when it confirms (it's not time sensitive).
If you pay more than it, it doesn't affect you. And further more it actually does the opposite of pushing up the fee rate (as I'm paying so much less than the confirm-now fee), and provides fee stability.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:39:15


That's not really relevant, it's not a payment. He's just proving he owns the funds. There's literally no point in double spending. And FWIW the transaction isn't bip125 and there's not a single miner (with &gt;1% of hash power) that would accept a double spend of that. So it's pretty much as good as confirmed anyway.
As for verifying it, I'm not quite sure how to do that off hand as it's p2sh address. But I don't think you have anything to worry about, considering the OP is from betking.io which has responsibly and honestly dealt with thousands of bitcoin in the past
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:21:24
Work in industry, can confirm. I'm actually kind of surprised how many companies rely on core's wallet, as it's not really optimized for that sort of thing (e.g. coin selection, or efficient access to unspent coins).
All these people know that proper segwit support is coming soon in core, so they're just waiting on it. So might want to put the pitchforks on hold for a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:06:07
I don't think there's any need to enforce a canonical ordering in a soft fork. If you wanted to benefit from graphene block relay your block would have to have a canonical order -- but I don't see why the consensus layer should care
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:52:54
Yeah, it's all about the confidence. Most clients default to something so there's a 95% chance your transaction will get confirmed within 6 blocks or something.
But if you low-ball the fee, it's very possible (e.g. 10% chance) you will get outbid (for instance, maybe the next block isn't found for an hour) and mess things up.
So there's a lot of factors to it. Probably the ideal "pick my own fee" would have "how many blocks do you want it in" as well as "with what probability"
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:26:02
bitwallet yet, greenaddress no.
I'd strongly recommend avoiding greenaddresses. They use multisig, where they control one of the keys. This makes your transactions bigger and more expensive, so to pave the way to try monetize you (e.g. promise merchants they won't allow you to double spend, so the transaction can instantly be accepted). Oh yeah, and they can freeze your funds and stuff (I got 0.1 BTC permalocked by them lol)

One thing to look into is investing in casino bankrolls. When players win, you lose. When players lose, you win. There's a few of reputable sites that offer that (pocketrocketcasino.eu, bitdice.me, moneypot.com (conflict of interest alert)) and historically investments have done very well.
Just don't do anything stupid, and over extend yourself (research the kelly criterion for more info). If you have 25 btc, putting more than 0.25 BTC in each site would be reckless.

I'm not sure it's going to be that much less secure. There's probably not many people who are able and willing to 51% attack BCH if it required ~1.25%  of the global sha256 hash power, compared to the ~2.5% required today.

@_date: 2017-11-22 21:38:26
Not only that, but so they can promise it won't be double-spent they privately hold one of keys. So all your sends are multi-sig, which makes them bigger and then you have to pay that additional cost too.
Blows my mind that anyone would use that wallet, rofl. The whole thing is just a shitty and expensive user-experience so they can have a plausible business model to rip off anyone dumb enough to put money funding the trash fire.

I think economic majority means what would happen if the two sides went to an "exchange war". Imagine there was a coinsplit, and for every 1 BTC you have, you got 1 BTC-SEGWIT  and BTC-NORMAL.
Which ever one has a higher price after some trading, I think means they are the economic majority. For instance, if BIP148 happened -- and the BTC-SEGWIT coins were worth more, then the BTC-NORMAL chain would actually eventually getting destroyed (because miners would start switching to BTC-SEGWIT which would end up also giving it the most amount of work in total)

The problem is this user is withdrawing to a service that uses blockchain.info for their data. They won't credit him the funds because the transaction shows up wrong for them.
Technically the fault lies with blockchain.info for sucking, and the service for using them for data (even when it's wrong). However, I'm trying to help my user out here who isn't particularly technical and not a native english speaker, so there's a significant communication barrier.
The best resolution would be if blockchain.info could fix this bug and repair its data. This just now happened to another transaction. ugggh.

God, trezor cables..
I probably wasted about 4 or 5 hours of my life trying absolutely every software package (which then involved compiling it all) to try get my trezor to work consistently (it was flakey as hell). The trezor would remain powered on, but no data communication was happening. Just before throwing it away someone asked if I have tried replacing the cable. And then immediately like magic it started working consistently.
Few months later, after I was happy with it with electrum (works much, much better than mytrezor.com) I ended up ordering a new one, which shipped with a cable that flat out didn't work.
While I'm pretty happy with my purchases, it's a little enraging for what is supposed to be a premium product. If they want to save a few cents on it, they should just not ship with a cable.

The UASF signaling means they're telling everyone they will split off the main chain, unless the main chain activates segwit. In reality it's just a bluff to encourage more people to do the same thing.
In theory, if the entire bitcoin economy split off the main chain to form a segwit chain -- then miners would have to join the bitcoin economy (no point producing blocks on a chain no one uses). In practice, I think the best case is enough people will do it to create viability minority split off, although I'm pretty skeptical there is enough coordination to do that.

Not quite. The UTXO set is a few gigabytes and not stores in memory in any implementation I'm aware of it.

The real interesting thing is to go through the companies that are against SegWit. Other than some miners, there's really not a single serious anything against it.
@_date: 2017-04-01 00:36:01


An simpler way: Your wallet just generates 10 transactions with different fee rates (e.g. 50sat/byte, 60 sat/byte, etc ). That's really easy by just lowering the change-amount a little, and resigning the transaction. And then it comes up with a release schedule  (e.g. each hour that it hasn't confirmed, propagate the next highest fee rate one). and gives it to a service to monitor. The absolute worst case would be that the service gives your highest feerate transaction to a miner prematurely, but if that happened then you'd know the service was compromised and could use a different one. (and ideally the wallet should be able to offer the ability to manage the process completely itself without use of a service if you don't mind being online)

As I understand it, an assassination market is a (theoretical?) idea where you bet on someone dying.
So if I want Bob dead, I'd bet 1000 BTC that Bob won't die soon (with nice shitty odds). So then an assassin sees that, takes up the bet and kills the person to guarantee they win.
It's an interesting thought experiment, because creating a betting exchange for random shit (e.g. someones death) doesn't seem inherently immoral. However having a platform that is used to organize killing is fucking scary and horrible.
I sincerely hope anyone who uses or promotes assassination markets spends a long time in prison, as the end result is pure unadulterated evil.

You actually changed my mind. I think your idea is the safer way forward. 
With any luck after closing the covertasicboost vulnerability, miners will go along with the bip9 style activation of segwit anyway (unless they're feeling spiteful, which would be an unfortunate situation indeed).
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:49:43
I (speaking as the operator of one bitcoins biggest gambling sites) would be willing to support UASF if it (also) fixes the covert ASICBOOST vulnerability. Purely activating segwit (if it allows normal ASICBOOST'd blocks) seems like far too much risk for too little gain.

This is like the 10th? time there's been a thread about it. His pool is just giving miners 1.1x the block subsidy (and he keeps the transaction fees). In the end he's making a net profit.
If he was actually paying +10% out, you can be pretty sure there would be a massive amount of miners taking up his offer until he ran out of money (which would make it rather ineffective at bribing miners)
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:51:35
If segwit activates you can still mine non-segwit blocks..
This makes bitmain completely compatible with it. They will just have to continue mining normal (or empty) blocks.

Good question. The best way I can think of is giving the BIP32 public seed my site uses (and me signing a message to prove i own it) for deposit addresses to a trusted auditor.

That should be pretty convincing evidence that I'm a large economic actor  (or wasted tens of thousands of dollars on transaction fees :P)

In this scenario the evil miner is attempting to find an alternate block 400001, but as the rest of the network has already seen a block 400001, all new transactions will have a nLockTime of 400001.
So what this means is while the evil miner is attempting to mine, they can't use the current (high fees) transactions to boost their profitability (they would be invalid in that block). So they will be forced to only have the previous transactions, thus they miss out on some high profit new ones.
So it doesn't stop them with the "huge fee" transaction in your scenario, but does theoretically make it a little less profitable for an attacker.

SegWit ELI5:   It's a backwards compatible upgrade to the bitcoin network. It fixes a bunch of long standing issues, and would directly add a small amount of extra capacity (~50%) and by fixing a bunch of issues it paves the road for a lot of really cool things in the future
While it has [broad support from all the serious players]( but there is considerable resistance from the bitcoin mining community and few vocal people.
Their main reasons for dissent seem to be:
 * It interferes with a patented mining boost, and would cause miners using it to lose their advantage.
 * It would provide short-term transaction fee relief, which would take away political support from projects that they view as a more long-term fix to the blocksize debate (give control to miners)
 * people who have reasons to attack the bitcoin community by dividing it it (e.g. check out who publicly thinks bitcoin bitcoin is a ponzi and does his best to attack it (e.g. write to the SEC) and attempt to divide the community on technical matters, etc)

I would personally prefer them bundled.
It's definitely nice to separate concerns so there's no accusations that ASICBOOST is just an excuse to push segwit through. However doing it that way is just going to take twice as long and lead to twice the drama.
If we're doing them separately, I think it's pretty important to fix the covert use of ASICBOOST first -- so that we know anyone opposing segwit isn't doing it for financial reasons. 
Plus, I think UASF is an extremely risky thing to be doing. It'll likely lead to a temporary chain split, with an economic war played out on the exchanges. I'd rather this only happen once if possible.

Yeah, should be easy to do indirectly. Using 0.14.0 of core set the transaction feerate to something like 5sat/byte and turn on opt-in RBF  (both configuration options). Do this to send transactions:
bitcoin-cli bumpfee $(bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress 1bitcoineateraddressdontsendf59kue 1) "{ \"confTarget\": 6}"

@_date: 2017-04-01 00:08:34


It's obviously not going to resolve it. I think a solution comes in the form of wallets and services elegantly handling doing CPFP and fee bumping. But the block size itself can change the constant-factor cost of spamming the blockchain. If the blocksize was doubled, you'd expect it'd cost an attacker around 2 times as much (or the attack last half as long).


Well that doesn't affect normal users who will be paying more than that anyway. That is however is a good reason you don't want the blocksize too big, or it's too easy to fill with crap that needs to be stored forever.

You sure? From my understanding, you can still mine normal blocks (as long as they don't try to spend from segwit outputs) after segwit is activated. So surely you can still mine covert asicblocks, they just wouldn't have segwit transactions in them
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:25:39
Yeah, it's because a lot of sites allow you to "bet" dust amounts (like 1 satoshi) and often sites pride themselves on how fast they let you bet and provide a bot to help. There was even a site (dicenow?) that allowed you to hit a button to make 10k bets in serial.
Personally I think we should come up with a more sensible definition of a bet that is when someone is betting at least $1 or something. But in the mean time, I advise everyone to just totally ignore raw bet count and instead look at amount wagered.
@_date: 2017-04-12 00:31:58


I'm not sure that's the case. His stance seems to be perfectly consistent if he believes that everyone should just use the asicboost technique regardless of its patent (which he views as an illegitimate grant).
But I'd also like to think he has the sense to realize that not everyone has the luxury of just ignoring patents, and leveling the playing field is the right thing to do.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:59:37
Keep in mind the UASF (for segwit) doesn't actually solve the ASICBOOST vulnerability (after all, miners can still mine old blocks).
For the ASICBOOST I'm not really sure a UASF is the right way to go either, but it's obviously not my call. I'd personally rather see something like a bip9 style activation, with an ultimatum that if miners refuse to activate to level the playing field then they'll be considered hostile and the PoW changed.
Either way, I think it needs to be dealt with as fast as possible.
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:08:57
It's also misleading because it's not divided by the amount of non-empty blocks they mine.

Yeah, that's really messy -- it's not a simple escrow problem. It's actually more akin to escrow + a business loan (for the factory), where they get a loan to buy the supplies based on the fact there is a committed buyer. 


I'm doing pretty well in the gambling niche, so I'm not really planning on starting anything new for the time being. I do think the problem with most bitcoin startups is they look at they are looking the wrong way and end up with something like "airbnb but with bitcoin" which everyone agree sounds great, but no one uses. 
I think in the short term, bitcoin will do best in the grey/black markets (e.g. gambling, drugs, etc.). In fact, if you want to gamble or buy drugs online -- bitcoin *is* currently the best way, hands down. There's not a single fiat casino that can nearly offer as good of a deal (for one, their costs are astronomical. Hell, it generally costs ~5%+ for a licensed casino (which itself isn't cheap) to process a visa payment.  Meanwhile my site operates on a ~0.29% margin. 
However for most businesses, bitcoin's properties have a lot of draw backs. e.g. If you're a hosting company, accepting bitcoin (without id verification) just means you'll get people who like the anonymous side of thing (which is probably not what you want). Or if you're a subscription site, you probably like the friction-free way of pulling from peoples accounts etc.
Actually one thing that never seizes to amaze me, is how little I use bitcoin to buy things. Almost everywhere gives the same price to pay with visa, and I get 1-2% cash back. So I use my credit card. I win, the merchant loses :/

Which should mean you should expect to find a collision after around 2^80 attempts. However, that's not as dangerous as it sounds because finding a collision is a *lot* more expensive than just hashing (you need to store and look them up) and even if you did find a collision, it's going to be an unused address.
And it's important to note the hardware that does mining, is completely useless for ripemd-160. Perhaps why satoshi designed bitcoin with two different hash functions?

Your terms of service *are* designed to screw people over. Fact. You guys have a [history of stealing money]( from users for betting more than the allowed by your terms of service. Your software accepts the bets, and then you take the entire sum of users balance for absolutely no reason other than your terms. Call it what you want, but in my eyes your nothing more than thieves.

If transaction T1 and T2 conflict, that means they will *always* conflict. So if T1 has confirmed, one year later Maxwell can't try get T2 confirmed, unless he redoes *an entire year* of blocks, removing T1 from the history. If someone did try to undo a year of block, it would be a huge disaster and a real blow to the practical implications of the consensus model, and people would agree to hard-fork to ignore that chain

Not really. Running a legitimate node does help the network, it makes it a bit more resilient and services light clients. Also mining doesn't require a node at all, I think the vast majority of miners don't run a node at all. Even technically a mining pool doesn't need to run a full node, although it's generally agreed to be good form :P

Yes, you're fine. You won't see it until it syncs up until the current day though. Although if you need to abort the process, you can just export the wallet and get the private key of that address and sweep it to another wallet.
I also wouldn't recommend using such a heavy client for casual bitcoin use. A light client like electrum for desktop  (or even better: mycelium for android, breadwallet for ios) will lead to a much better user experience.

Do you have the private key for the address '1LjN5khAo7kqK8VjMK9p3FBP5vBP3tnrk1'? If so, you can (and could have) spent from that address to your final destination (or another wallet address you have) and pick a large fee (e.g. 50 cents), and it'll prioritize the parent transaction as well. I've done it a dozen or so times, and normally use  to manually create it and it works great.
I'm hoping wallets will soon have a "prioritize" button to incoming transactions, to help with this common problem

Of course it does. And even if you try redefine the term "the network" to exclude the vast majority of bitcoin users (who will never run a full node), it also helps full clients bootstrap, and what not. 


No I'm not. Most miners connect to a mining pool, and doing that doesn't require a full node. Unless you want to redefine that term "miner" as well. 


Mining pools don't strictly have to. Just checking block headers is enough 99.99% of the time. There's probably less than a couple dozen invalid blocks ever generated (that match the difficulty, but would be rejected by the network). Anyway, I'm not advocating it - but it's certainly very feasible, and has been done before.

The structured payments don't need to go through the escrow service directly. e.g. In the contract you'd just have
"I'll be paying address 1xxxxxx    $1000 USD per month for the first 4 months" 
and the escrow agent can easily see if that was filled or not  (and no need for middlemen)

@_date: 2016-09-18 04:07:58


I don't see why that's a problem. As an escrow agent, it's no problem to do partial releases.  Or by using pre-agreed bitcoin addresses, it is easy to prove funds were or were not sent. Also 0.25% is a very reasonable amount of money, as that should be about ~$5k USD a year for quite a small amount of work. I'm pretty sure you'll find a lot of escrow agents jump at the opportunity.  I don't mind handling large amounts of money, or acting as a 2-of-3 escrow agent for free (as long as there is an exact set of procedures i go through)  but to act as a human escrow, the cost of the distraction would be more than that for me :D


I think I can count six, but to be honest  -- bustabit.com has been my only real success. I think in the last year, I haven't done much more than hanging out in the chat and doing support tickets. Which has given me a lot of time to do and fail at other stuff :P  (But actually now I'm going back to bustabit and focusing my efforts there again)
 
 &gt; Reading gambling: I always thought that a start-up should charge zero for all bets and make no money at all until their community hit a certain size...then SLOWLY start to implement fees. I LOVED InTrade. I spent a lot of money on that site until they were shut down. I wish there were something like that (with a large community) using bitcoin for all those bets. I know there are small players...but I want to win $20k on a bet...not $20.
There's sites that support that, betking.io is a quite legitimate site with a crowd funded bankroll which will allow you to win up to 144k USD (with a 1% house edge). 
I tend to lean the other way as a site owner, I'd rather have higher volume and a lower edge. I think of all sites, bustabit has the lowest limits (max bet: 1 btc) but  by volume because we operate at ~1/4th the margin as any competitor.  It makes it very hard for anyone to undercut you (unless they have huge volumes, they're not going to be enough to pay the bills) and importantly for me, it means there's not much variance. Even with my low limits, I've had days where I've had to process wins of 200 BTC.  
(I have some maths models of why you can't offer zero charges though, effectively as a casino you have unbounded risk for 0 expected gain )

Yeah, it's an establish business model. It's been happening for years. I get them all the time (I run a bitcoin casino), even with demands as low as 0.1 btc. Most of the ones that say "I /will/ ddos your site" tend to be kids who don't even have the means of ddosing your site, they're just hoping you're stupid enough to pay them.
Normally the more serious extortionists will actually ddos your site first, take it down and /then/ send you an email so you know they're serious. As tempting as it may be, never give in to these people or you'll set yourself up as an easy mark. I've had our site taken down for the better part of a week and through a combination of making it clear I'd never pay them a cent and improve our ddos defenses they gave up and never came back.

Amazon charges $0.09 per GB for data egress, so all you need to do is download a few terabytes from someone and you start to really hurt their wallet.

That said, I do agree that rust is even a step above for safety.

I personally receive a lot more transactions than I send out, so for me a typical transaction has more than two inputs. I guess many users also send a lot more than they receive, so typical will be one input. But anyway, I think two inputs and two outputs is a very stable value -- so makes for a good standard transaction.


You're right. I made a mistake here, I actually got my original number by looking at the first 2-input 2-output transaction I saw:

I actually used to run an escrow site (bithra.com) but recently completed the shut down after we cleared all our existing obligation. It's kind of a bitch of an industry, when you're dealing with both technologically advanced scammers and clueless users with good intentions. It was disillusioning having robust guarantees, and having scammers social-engineer their way around it, and what not.
But anyway, if your suppliers are up for it, I'd recommend just creating 2-of-2 multisig address. You can use a wallet like copay or do it manually here: 
Or if you don't want to risk your money getting permanently stuck in a dispute, you can use 2-of-3 multisig, and pick a trusted escrow agent to hold the third key. e.g. my public key would be `02614febbda6c1f95f7b7099e402ce9ff31d9523b0e6c6171b2bd2c4040a79b3fb` which would allow you to use me as a 3rd party (please don't though, unless both parties have clarified and sent me signed instructions).
But if yall wanted, I'd be happy to provide such service for free. I'd just need unambiguous instructions of exactly how I should proceed in all cases, and then I'll sign a message committing to that  (so you can use it as a form of fraud proof). As I run bustabit (the second? biggest bitcoin casino) it would do a lot more damage to me than a few hundred thousand dollars. (And FWIW, I have a verifiable history on holding and returning &gt; $500k usd worth of other peoples bitcoins for them when I owned moneypot) 
Or if assuming all parties wanted, I could also do a pretty low-tech escrow service (e.g. an escrow address exclusively controlled by me) and I take instructions from all non-forged emails, but I'd need like 0.5% of all values to make it worth the trouble XD
There's also bitrated, but you still need to find a mutually trustworthy person which is most of the problem anyway. I'm a bit hesitant to recommend them, as having tried to develop a 100% automated escrow solution you realize that without a human in the middle, most non-technical users are at such risk of being manipulated it's pretty scary

You can pretty safely key-stretch a much less amount of coin-flips into a seed. But even with 120 coin flips, the data entry would get pretty tedious. But it's something you only have to do once, not a huge deal.
I actually like the idea of shuffling a deck of cards, then entering in the order. I think there's 2^225 possible shuffles, so with a mild key stretch you're totally fine. And if you keep your shuffled deck of cards, you have a pretty stealthy seed backup :D

Transactions are bit more expensive than that. Using the official bitcoin core client, it is currently using a fee of: 0.00062614 btc / kilobyte. A typical transaction has two inputs and two outputs, which is around ~594 bytes. That gives us:
0.00062614 * (594 / 1024) = 0.0003632101171875 btc
Or 21.6 cents.
I don't doubt it's possible to send transactions cheaper, but that's the fees the standard client is using.

One of the things I dislike most about hardware wallets is  how they generate a seed for me. It's a process that could easily be backdoored, without me being able to verify.
So what I'd really like is if it had an interactive UI to generate my own seed, even if I have to sit around like an idiot flipping a coin a couple hundred times ... or shuffle a deck of a card and read out the order.
With that the entire process can be deterministic, and much easier to verify and harder to backdoor.

Depending on your computer and internet connection. I've had beefy computers that can sync in half a day, and others that literally take a week. You can also dump the wallet and try import it into a lighter client if you get impatient (I vaguely remember blockchain.info's wallet allows you to restore a bitcoin core wallet dump) and then from there you can transfer it to a better wallet

Guess they changed behavior. I used to extensively use the coinbase API back when they had free transactions (if you sent more than X), and if the recipients address was owned by coinbase it would use an off-chain transaction.   (A behavior I found quite annoying, because I had to deal with two different transaction types, and it leaked to both me and receiver we both used coinbase)
Possible when they started charging for withdrawals, they started unconditionally using actual bitcoin transactions.

Accepting and making lightning network payments will be very different than accepting normal bitcoin transactions -- if it's abstracted or not, will depend completely on the software you use. But it's fundamentally different in a few regards, so I'd expect to make a few changes
However, at this point, I wouldn't really worry about it until some standards emerge. If you're interested, or want the discounts -- I'd instead be more reading about segwit itself. It should be live within a few months and it's very concrete at the moment. Depending on how you currently process transactions, it's extremely similar, but will be a bit cheaper to send (especially when you source multiple inputs)
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:19:03
Keep in mind there was a ~3 month period where it wasn't possible to consolidate cheaply, so there's a lot of catching up to do. FWIW I have about ~1MB of consolidation I'm still trying to get confirmed at 1.01 sat/byte (i.e. 3c972d48901d85d412f99f47ed3333aef85f62c827121def32d38cd8889f9cea), but no luck yet. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:10:46
There are a few potential draw backs:
a) The bigger the batch, the more efficient it is. But the longer you need to wait before sending it.
b) The more inputs and outputs a transaction has the less privacy you have. Most big batch transactions have pretty readily identifiable senders. If you however are really clever, you can actually use batching to help privacy by only processing subsets of it. To the best of my knowledge only the bitcoin casinos bustabit/bustadice support this, as well as the coin selection service coinsayer.com )
c) Each transaction you make has a sort of "negative pressure" on your wallet utxo, helping keep your wallet clean and consolidated (especially a smart wallet with good change avoidance). Batching inherently means you make less transactions, so it can put a lot of strain on your wallet utxo making it more important to to consolidate.
But the thing that worries me about batching, is how it benefits from economies of scale. Big volume sites that do effective batching can offer users much lower costs and much less wait times. For example a site like bustabit can offer half the withdrawal fees as it's competitors due to scale. I think this is a bit of an unhealthy centralization pressure
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:54:18

I'm personally pretty agnostic to segwit2x. I plan on exclusively using which ever side of the fork demonstrates it has the most market value.
But it's not surprising that Charlie (or anyone heavily invested in an altcoin like litecoin) would be against it. Something like 90% (number totally made up) of litecoin's value proposition just comes from being able to make ridiculously cheap transactions.
It's kind of funny all the opposition you see from people who materially benefit from bitcoins base layer being congested and expensive.

Yeah, but having appropriate size unspents is actually very common. In my simulations if you go out of your way to produce them (by when you actually create change), in &gt;50% of transactions you can avoid change (obviously that will depend heavily on how you use bitcoin).
The secret is that change is bad more than just privacy, but it's expensive. It makes your transaction bigger (an extra output) and there's future cost of spending it. So currently core requires *exact* matches to avoid creating change, but by being smart an assigning a tolerance you can do a better job.  (for perspective currently core omits change in &lt; 1 in 10k of my transactions. With improved coin selection it can rise as high as &gt;50%)
There's a lot of potential for optimization! :D
Disclaimer: In my use case I receive more than I send (about 2:1 ratio), which makes it easier. If you are a consumer wallet and have 1 deposit and then 50 small spends there's pretty much nothing improved coin selection can do for you.

Is this really good behavior? When I implemented batching in the past, I explicitly avoided merging outputs as it didn't seem obviously correct. (e.g. maybe alice wanted a 1 and 2 bitcoin outputs in her wallet). Or maybe it's two different people paying the same person, and will now need to explain that their amounts got merged. Or probably more likely, I'm over thinking things.
(Also by not merging results in a slightly cleaner data model of each withdrawal having a 1:1 mapping with a (txid,vout)
@_date: 2016-09-22 03:44:36
Increased fees definitely make people think twice before making bitcoin transactions. Before on bustabit (the gambling site I run), there used to be about 1.5 withdrawals for every deposit made, and fees were 100 bits or about $0.06.  Later I had to increase the fees to 200 bits, and found that people drastically changed their behavior and there were less withdrawals than deposits, which ironically made processing withdrawals even more expensive for me (lots more inputs = bigger transaction sizes). So now I charge 300 bits per withdrawal, and have about 2.1x more deposits than withdrawals.
Anyway, considering block space and bandwidth is a shared resource, this is probably a good thing that people are more careful about using it. I just really, really hope we're not pushing people from bitcoin too early :/
Also average block size might not be the best way to measure-- as empty blocks are heavily going to bias it. And empty blocks normally exist not because miners have no transactions to mine, but rather the miner isn't sure which transactions are safe to mine. So perhaps median block size is actually a better metric
@_date: 2016-09-18 18:08:51
Yeah, if the transaction was sent 1 day ago -- you'll need to sync until there's 1 day left in order to "see" the transaction. 
That said, I don't think normal users should be using such a heavy solution like bitcoin core. A light wallet like electrum, or better a phone wallet: mycelium (for android) or breadwallet (for ios) i think makes a far better choice

In the cumulative, I'm sure it does impact the price. But I don't think it's too relevant for a single commit (unless it's some big news) and in fact just ends up creating noise.

FWIW about 2 or 3 months ago, I confirmed that ViaBTC was doing the priority thing (and used my own very-large, very-old transaction to make sure it wasn't from their free accelerator service).
But all in all the amount of priority mining was negligible then, and now I suspect totally dead (although haven't confirmed)
Edit: Now that I think about it, it was probably longer ago than that. Maybe 4 or 5 months ago? Either way, the amount was so insignificant it wasn't worth considering a feasible way to get transactions confirmed
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:05:49
Not really. The old version didn't really have "proper" segwit support, even over rpc (see the release notes of 0.16 for what was missing). You could certainly try hack it, but it's beyond the comfort level for most services. And not to mention, even if you do there are unintended side effects (like the wallet not being aware of it's own change, so you can't do things like bumpfee)

@_date: 2017-09-29 17:00:23
Of course there is: you need to have compatibility. If you don't, you will invalidate things like time-locked transactions, which will result in people losing money.
Even me for instance, I have &gt;1 bitcoin in total stuck in a timelock deal that can't be put on the blockchain for another 6 or so months. Segwit2x can't be the successor to the current chain if it's going to screw people in my position.
(And as more and more people use 2nd layer stuff like lightning, compatibility becomes even more and more important)

I believe that which ever fork is worth more after the fork is what the economic majority wants, and thus what truly is bitcoin.
I'm pretty agnostic because I honestly don't feel too strongly about it either way. There's a lot of pros and cons on both sides. And what ever slight preference I have is overwhelmed by my desire to stay with the economic majority.
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:06:36
Yeah, but that's fine (within reason).
For instance, what I do is compute the "cost of creating change". Basically how much bigger it makes the transaction (32 bytes) * the fee rate of the transaction. And the cost of spending it in the future (~91 vbytes) by how much I think it'll cost to consolidate (e.g. say half the current fee rate).
So let's just say that is 40000 satoshis. Now what that means is that if I overpay 39999 satoshis (because I don't have exact change) it's actually more economic! (And has better privacy aspects, the extra money is just used to get a higher fee rate anyway)

Why not? I checked the rules, I don't see anything against giveaways
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:33:53
I'm looking now, and strangely all the transactions are quite big and seem to have the same input amounts. Here's an example:
Lots of the inputs are also super old. 
My guess this is someone doing a big transaction consolidation batch, and screwed up the fee rate. They should've been doing 1.11 sat/byte. If so, this is a super expensive mistake.
This could also be an attack, but a sunday night (US time) seems like a stupid time to do it. They are guaranteeing that lots of their transactions are going to confirm, costing them a lot

@_date: 2017-09-12 16:46:48
I think you're taking your frustration out in a pretty non-productive way. If bitcoin privacy is bad, then were will always be actors exploiting it.
Instead there's some pretty low-hanging fruit that would make such attacks far more difficult.
a) Supporting a mode that guarantees your wallet doesn't reuse addresses (if someone sends to an address that's already been used, it automatically is quarantined). I believe I've offered a 1 BTC bounty for this in core
b) Aggressively avoiding create change addresses. Currently the  primary loss of privacy in bitcoin is due to poor coin selection algorithms, like core's which almost always creates very predictable change amounts, and almost never avoids creating change at all. There's definitely some progress on this front, but a more general and reusable coin selection approach needs to be taken 
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:57:13
This is obviously a lot more elegant, but I've never used a consumer wallet (AFAIK) that supports it. The cool thing about the magic p2sh address, is that anyone can trivially split their coins with out any new software.
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:08:05
It's an address anyone can (cheaply) spend from. The point of having a hard-coded address is so that anyone can super easily split their coins without special software. It's not very elegant, but it's a pretty pragmatic solution
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:34:14
The biggest disadvantage, at least from my perspective:
* Volatility
Ideally (again, for me) bitcoin value would never go up or down, but stay stable regardless of how many (or few) users/holders, or what happens to world currencies etc. I doubt this is a fixable property, and I'm sure this will get better with time.
My two biggest worries are:
* Bitcoin's approach to change
There seems to be no real defined path for change or improvements to happen to the core protocol. Many people believe bitcoin is what it is, and the rules are set in stone. Other people believe it should be dictated by hash power. And other by economic vote. I think this will become a problem.
* The deflationary property of bitcoin
I'm not an economist and I don't understand this. But from what I've heard from people that know a lot more than me is they think a macro economy based around something like bitcoin would sufferer hugely. I know there's also people who refute this. I don't know enough to form an opinion either way, but it is something that does worry me due to the large-scale impact it would have as bitcoin becomes more and more popular

While it's great to see more wallets supporting segwit, and I commend them on moving fast with segwit. But of the dozen or so wallets I've used, by far the worst experience has been with greenaddress. I try to encourage people to stay far away from it. (blockchain.info's gets a close second worst, but I believe things there have been improving)
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:22:26
After a new block is mined, for speed miners might not want to download the entire block and just get the headers. If they do that, they won't know exactly which transactions were in the latest block, and thus they won't know what transactions is safe for them to mine. So the best thing they can do is just include no transactions (other than the coinbase, which pays them).
Then presumedly after they download and verify the latest block, they can start mining a "proper" block that includes transactions. You'll notice most of the time "empty" blocks are mined, they're immediately after another block was just mined
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:39:07
My personal favorite is the trezor. I can highly recommend it.
I've heard good things about the ledger S,~~but because it doesn't support arbitrary hidden accounts, it's not that useful to me (but it's probably great for 99% of people).~~ But I haven't had the time to use it much (something I'll try make time for soon)
On mobile I like breadwallet, although wish they had more power features. And on desktop I like electrum, although I don't think many people should be using desktop wallets (for security reasons) but it also works well with the trezor.
The wallets I strongly **recommend against**:
* greenaddress -- It's a terrible wallet, that uses multisig which means your transactions cost more and they can lock your account as they have done to mine (they now refuse to accept any request for me to try send money after I talked bad about them and released my mnemonic, [backstory\)](
* Mycelium -- I really like their wallet, but they've been doing a bunch of questionable things since they got their crowd funding
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:17:44


It's very useful for users, they can use their existing wallets to split coins. That's pretty cool.


I really don't understand why they don't do this as well. Especially if bitcoin businesses are planning on using segwit2x from day 1, it almost seems essential they can easily create non-replayable transactions.

No one has debunked the [teapot is orbiting the sun]( either. I don't know about you, but I require a slightly higher burden of proof. Like, you know, a cryptographic signature[1].

Sure, but not everyone needs that. You'd only do it if you didn't care if you had to recreate a new transaction if it conflicted

I thought it was pretty smart. Most people wanted a block size increase, so a sensible compromise would be a small block size increase (like, say, a doubling). But if you could make people think there was a demand for a block size decrease, then a compromise is doing nothing.

Satoshis didn't write RBF, and even advocated for 0-conf transactions for low-value use cases:
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:36:51
Have you tried? ;D
It already works that way, at least it did a couple years ago. I actually found that behavior a bit annoying, because it leaked if the address was a coinbase address or not.  But regardless, the typical way to transfer between coinbase accounts is off chain (as it's cheaper)
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:55:51


He created a public pgp key, and has signed transactions before. 
Yeah, it's theoretically possible it's the real satoshi wanting plausible deniability when publishing this message (by not signing it). In the same way it's possible CSW is the real satoshi doing his best impression of being a charlatan. But c'mon...
Honestly, I find this sort of whole style of arguing a point rather distasteful and borderline dishonest. It's a favorite tactic of quacks: *"There's not a single scientific study that has shown this silver infused water doesn't cure cancer!"*. I mean, yeah, the claim is correct but it's rooted in manipulation.
If Satoshi wishes to say something, he's perfectly capable of proving it. Let's not embarrass ourselves with implicitly endorsing crap because we like what it says.

I'd be happy to act as arbitrator for free. I run what is probably the highest volume bitcoin casino (at least at the moment). You can see on:  that it's linked to both this reddit account and the casino.
If you two can come up with the complete terms, both agree to it me at ryan  I'll quote the terms along with a pubkey that you can use for a 2-of-3 escrow address.
It'll also be my expectation that you two need to sort it out post-fork by yourself, and I'll only be involved if one of you go AWOL or refuses to sign the send. (But since I'd be providing the service for free, I don't want to sign up to much work)
Edit: You guys should also expand on "no segwit2x, no deal". Does a single block count? What if it's a tiny miner minority? etc. etc. 
Edit2: If there's a "third fork" (e.g. "core" does a hard fork to change the difficulty or PoW algo, who gets those coins?)

No it doesn't (during low fees and empty blocks it makes economic sense to sweep), not to mention I'm sure some people will use these outputs as inputs in their transactions to guarantee no replay 
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:18:08
I don't think this works


I'm not aware of any anti-replay patch has been merged in that would make this possible.
You really have to do it the other way:  Create a &gt;1MB (base size) transaction, and by-definition it is only valid on the segwit2x chain and not the original.  (The main hiccup I can see here, is that the transaction will be non-standard so you need to convince a miner to include it. But as Roger has a mining pool, that's not an issue)

That's not quite true. You "only" need a majority to censor transactions (or more technically: soft fork)
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:34:01
Not quite. A change in consensus rules only creates a hard fork if the change is not compatible with previous clients. Stuff like "XXX address is not allowed to send coins" would be perfectly compatible with previous clients (they just see a block without those transactions). 
A good example was when Satoshi added the 1MB block limit, that was a soft fork (because it's more restrictive) but removing the limit would now be a hard fork. Blacklisting would work the same.

Hmm? When was this? Do you have a txid?  I have been trying to get transactions through at 1.01 sat/B for over 3 months with no luck. e.g.
It's been continuously relayed since 2017-11-13, is standard and pays 1.01 sat/byte.
(I also have another few dozens stuck in the same boat.  FWIW the ones paying &gt;= 2 sat/byte all cleared though)
Anyway, it's kind of ridiculous to judge bitcoin by how it does at it's "best" rather than it's worst.
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:27:34
This whole post is nonsense. The transaction you linked to is simply a:
and is paying a decent fee rate. 
And BTW if a miner doesn't want a transaction to propagate, it doesn't need to create dust (to trigger the "non-standardness") it would simply just not propagate it lol. (but miners don't like creating blocks with unpropagated transactions, as it's slow and increases their orphan rate...)
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:49:55
This is seriously retarded. Pretty much all sites refer to it as "bitcoin cash". It looks desperate trying to do a hostile rebranding, which itself almost makes them look good.
Seriously, if you hate bitcoin cash (or any altcoin) just ignore it. Attention is what they all crave, and what makes them seem like a viable alternative. And honestly, bitcoin cash is one of the least interesting altcoins in the entire space.
(And yes, I while I appreciated how they did a clean fork with relay protection, I find the whole "bitcoin cash is bitcoin" is pretty bullshit and intentionally deceptive -- the appropriate response isn't to waste time looking like an idiot either)
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:31:23
Yes, although one issue is that that most miners are very noisy. I'm not really sure what can be done to mitigate this. The other issue is that a miner is a pretty big expenses, and while the heating effect might be pretty desirable in the winter .. what about later in the year? If you're only planning on mining 3 months a year, there's no way you can economically justify the cost of the miner.
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:48:01
This would be my ideal solution, to be honest. I'm a big fan of segwit, and 2MB blocks would give us a lot of breathing room for the lightning network to start to take off.
However, this place is toxic for discussion. I see that ViaBTC's blog post: "Why We Must Increase the Block Size and Why I Support Bitcoin Unlimited" was completely deleted from here, while [criticizing an except is cool](
A precondition to compromise or understanding is actually letting the other side speak.

"next few blocks" = hours. Each block should happen every ~10 minutes (but there's a lot of variance, they can be &lt;1m or 60+).

I spent some last night thinking about it, and I think you're right. Under normal circumstances I think, it would actually be less than not more than 2x.


Well, I guess that very much depends on the attacker. But perhaps a more optimistic way of looking at it is, with an attacker with a certain budget they could do half as much damage, or for only half as long? But it's also defeatist to just assume we're up against someone with unlimited funds.

Yeah: batching, RBF and segwit will all help me greatly. My customers are a pretty impatient bunch, they want to see the transaction on the network right away. So I don't want to batch, but my plan is to do a real low-ball transactions, and then have a process that checks on it in 60 minutes. If it's not confirmed in 60 minutes, bump the fee to high priority. 
@_date: 2016-10-30 18:18:27
No idea, out of my depth. I know very little of economics.
@_date: 2016-10-15 05:46:00
Yeah, although that would suggest overt corruption on the behalf of miners. At that point they could just do a soft-fork and refuse to build on any block that wasn't mined by them. It would cut revenue to all external miners to 0, and make it almost impossible for any of them to get started to threaten the cartel.
But using very-large blocks doesn't require cartel-action, it just would require a single miner to find a threshold for the block that some of the miners would ignore, but the majority would build upon.

@_date: 2016-10-09 04:38:35
It's a much more significant change, and thus going to be hugely more controversial. There's a lot of advantages, especially from users perspective. And the first 1 and 2 confirmations are massively more important than the others, so it does make a lot of sense trying to have them happen as soon as possible. On the other hand probably the biggest downside is that there will be a lot more block races and orphans per day, which will favor centralization and low latency mining connections. The extra amount of block headers also might make it a bit harder on SPV phone wallets too.
Like most things, it's just a bunch of trade offs. Since 10 minutes is already so arbitrary, there's no real way you'll get consensus on changing it. At least with block size everyone knows it's going to change, it's just a question of when and how, and you can see how controversial that has been.
@_date: 2016-10-19 19:57:03


Yeah, I'm sure they would. That's actually why I like segwit so much, because it never temporarily takes the pressure off the fee market. But yeah, it'll soon go back to having full blocks (hopefully without too much tooling festering in the mean time) but having full 2 or 4MB blocks would be a lot better than having full 1M blocks. As presumedly the fees would be both lower and stable.
But ultimately all of the block sizes are going to be arbitrary, and I get your reluctance for picking one arbitrary number over another. 


When I ask people what wallet they're using, *by far* the biggest offender is blockchain.info wallets. I'm not sure if that's because blockchain.info is by far the biggest wallet (or attracts the biggest share of new bitcoiners) or why. Then there's services, like coins.ph and faucets which send with very low fees, and I always have unhappy people.  But even well designed wallets people select the "ultra low fee" option, and then a few hours later regret it and typically have nothing they could do but wait and wait and complain.
I suspect probably the only wallet that doesn't have issues is electrum (?) that actually offers a "bump this transactions fee" option.
But the problem has gotten so bad, I've actually developed a cheap and nasty "pull this transaction" script, that uses CPFP to pull someones deposit to make it confirmed. I haven't automated it, or integrated it into the website but I'll use it if a high roller has a deposit stuck. Eventually I guess I'll need to actually offer it as a service and charge for it

Or maybe it's the opposite?
If I was purely speculating, I wouldn't give a crap because I'd need to make a grand total of two transaction.
The reason I care about the blocksize is because I actually use bitcoin on a day to day basis, having built a business upon it that has made 938 transactions in the last 24h. So the increased fees and unpredictability are definitely hurting a little =(

@_date: 2016-10-27 04:20:52
I'm not convinced it is an attack, but lets say it was and you could identify the transactions:  You'd have to convince miners to not include those attack transactions (which means convincing them leaving money on the table), which also means the attackers would not have to spend any money for a failed attack, and they could fix the attack to make it like normal transactions, which isn't particularly hard.  (Or you could open a can of worms that no one sane wants to open, and soft-fork-freeze outputs that attempted to attack the network)
Best way combat an attack I see is either:
a) When you notice an attack, minimize your use of the bitcoin network. That means it'll cost the attacker a lot more, as miners will be mining more of their transactions
b)  Increase the block size, so pushing fees up is even more expensive
@_date: 2016-10-18 02:06:09

Because bitcoin core almost always constructs a change address that is ~0.01 btc. Look at this transaction and try guess which is the change:
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:57:20
Yeah, except that the extra risk of orphaning is just not very high anymore. Because because miners don't care about propagating to the whole network, just propagating to the majority of the hashing power. With fast interconnects and a relay network (that has pre-propagated actual transactions) it means that a small handful of miners in somewhere like china could be completely comfortable with 200MB blocks, and happily include anyones transaction who pays 1 satoshi/byte while everyone else trying to enter the market suffers huge problems.
And the entire network will have to deal with the mess..
@_date: 2016-10-15 02:26:10
Perhaps I'm misunderstanding this, but the logic here is that miners won't want to produce too big of a block, as their peers might ignore it which will increase it's chance of being orphaned?
However, wouldn't a large miner *want* some of its peers to ignore the block. Imagine a block too big that 10% of hashing power ignores it, that means that 90% of hashers are building upon it. So anyone in the 90% is hugely advantaged by the lack of competition, more so than the risk the 10% hashing power finds two blocks in a row before they find one.

It's not clear at all how this works. Since bcoin is javascript based, when you deposit in purse.io are you depositing into a wallet that you control the private keys, or one where they control the private keys? And when I buy something, is there an actual bitcoin transaction happening (or payment channels?) or just a database entry of "balance" being updated?

It's actually been working very well =) Just too expensive for me to be pulling most users deposits through (most user deposits are way too small) .

@_date: 2016-10-26 03:35:56
This is really becoming rather nightmarish.
For an ~20 minute period all my transactions made using a fee rate of `estimatefee 4` had fees low enough that they all got stuck behind a few megabytes of transactions, and needed to manually bump them all with CPFP.
..and dealing with 50 support tickets today from people trying to deposit who were/are having issues (majority from people sending from localbitcoin, interestingly). 
Calling `getwalletinfo` just after the last block got mined, shows my wallet has 6.96246527 BTC of unconfirmed_balance. That's all real users who are like "wtf" and just having a shitty experience with bitcoin.
I suspect you can't build a decent experience on top of bitcoin right now, unless you use CPFP to pull peoples stuck incoming transaction, and RBF for bumping stuck outgoing ones
Sorry for the rant, just feeling pretty jaded right now. On one side we have some retards who don't understand what irrevocable damage  removing the block size would be, and on the other side a group of people who are seemingly unwilling to compromise.

@_date: 2016-10-27 03:34:18
I really don't like the idea of using "average of last N blocks" because it means a miner can't apply downward pressure without throwing away money.
There really needs to be a mechanism of:
"I'm going to make a 2MB block, because it's allowed -- but I think we should only support 1.5MB blocks"
But I also don't like the idea of miners being able to vote on the block size, to be honest. Perhaps it could work out if any changes (be it increase or decrease) had to get approval of 95% of miners, and restricted to say a max of 5 or 10% chance at once.
@_date: 2016-10-05 20:25:44

Bitcoin nodes do not store my casinos gambling transactions, they just store the deposits and withdrawals. Players have made 173,495,684  bets, but only 288,808 bitcoin transactions. And in fact nodes only need to store the UTXO of which my casino has bloated by an almighty 52 outputs.
In exchange, I've on boarded thousands of new bitcoin users and because of my site people have bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of bitcoin, not to speculate, but to actually get utility from. I think 99.99% of bitcoin'ers would believe that I'm only adding value to bitcoin.

I think bitcoin unlimited is becoming a huge problem. I recently posted on about the [flaws in it]( and the community response poorly summarized is apparently "You're right, but YOLO". 
However, people are going to rally around it until there's a fix to the issues they're facing in bitcoin. Which is high fees, and shitty experience around "stuck" transactions. I probably answer 20+ support tickets per day from people who try deposit into my site and blame me for not crediting them money when their transaction is stuck. Most of the fault lies with the tooling around bitcoin, not bitcoin itself, but it doesn't change the fact it's a horrible experience that they blame blocksize for.
Segwit is a great step, but it's really not going to be enough. Bitcoin Core agreeing to a 2 or 4M one-time block size increase would go along way to fixing a lot of the pain bitcoin users are feeling now, give people something sane to support and give 2nd layer solutions time to actually develop.
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:51:57
Ideally wallets will start implementing the idea of bumping the priority of transactions by increasing the fees. This can be done either by pulling the transaction (spending from one of it's outputs) or by replacing it.
The actual bitcoin network supports it, but AFAIK no wallet really offers decent support yet. So we're stuck in a pretty shitty situation for now. Especially so when we see a surge in transactions relative to the amount of blocks and fee predictions get wrong (like we saw yesterday).
@_date: 2016-10-27 05:03:17
I'm not sure I really like the metric "average confirmation time" as it conflates a few things.
Lets imagine there's no backlog. The "average confirmation time" should bounce around ~10 minutes. When blocks are mined fast, the time will go down, when blocks are mined slow, the time goes up.
But now imagine it having a backlog (which should kind of be the natural state of things, I think), when blocks are mined fast, they will reach deeper into the backlog -- which will *increase* the average confirmation time. When blocks are mine slow, the average confirmation time will decrease.
So basically "average confirmation time" is a combination of two factors that act weirdly with each other.

From a technical point of view, the bitcoins are still with the sports gambling site. They've just broadcasted a payment, which is valid but may or may not get accepted by the network. 
The bitcoin network tries to "protect" you from them double spending, by refusing to propagate any conflicting transaction. However this protection starts to wear off after 1-2 days, where the site will be able to spend it again.
You can also "pull" the transaction, using "child pays for parent" but that's quite technical. Best bet is just to complain to the sports gambling site, when enough people do so, they'll probably readjust their policies.

A normal bank owes a lot more money than they actually have, so if everyone tries to withdraw at the same time it's a "bank run" and not good news.
An institution that uses bitcoin could easily get into the same situation (e.g. MtGox) if they are reserve banking, but bitcoin itself (or any asset) can't.
However, that doesn't mean bitcoin price can't crash. Satoshi could come tomorrow and be like: "fuck bitcoin, i'm going to support ethereum" and put 1M bitcoin for sale on the market and your bitcoins wouldn't be worth an awful lot. (Not that I think that would happen)

Oh nice thinking. That seems obvious in retrospect, not sure why I didn't think of it. When I bump the fee, I can do so with a big merged transaction.

For those of you that do not know about the program, BitTXGenerator generates false Bitcoin transactions using a valid Sending and Receiving address and a satoshi amount (one satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC).

The transaction will appear on the blockchain and all the Bitcoin clients as a normal Bitcoin transaction until it gets a negative confirmation.

Imagine we have full 1MB blocks now where you need to pay at least 100 satoshi/byte to get mined.  And imagine a hypothetical future where we have full 2MB blocks where you need to pay at least 100 satoshi/byte to get mined.
So lets say I have a fixed budget, and want to push up the transaction fees on one of them. Which do you imagine would be significantly easier to do so on?
My intuition says it'd cost more than 2x as much to push up transaction fees by a fixed amount on the 2MB network than on the 1MB, but I'm not sure I can justify that with logic. But it's clearly a lot harder to attack


No one has been using on-chain dice for a *long* time now. No gamblers want to burn 20 cents per bet in fees, when they could use an offchain site that offers a *significantly* better UX with no per-bet fee.
I think it's pretty reasonable to assume we're just running at full capacity, no attack or bad actors required.

In the last 7 days, my wallet has received 3833 transactions, while sent 1848. So the transactions are going to be a bit bigger than someone who purely sends money (other than the infrequent exchange purchase)
This is reasonably expected, as it's a casino where people lose a little more than then they win. But interestingly this ratio has changed a lot over the last few years. When fees were a lot less (for them, and withdrawing) people would make a lot more micro transactions, doing several withdraws. But now people naturally batch a lot more

Let's not twist his words, it makes us look like a retarded eco-chamber.
He's saying that segwit is "unfairly cheap" not that he's against lower fees. I don't agree with him at all (as segwit weight better approximates the network burden compared to raw size), but it's a reasonable position.
Also miners will almost certainly clearly make more money under segwit than without it (if you ignore any ASICBOOST stuff), so trying to pretend miners are blocking it because they like high transaction fees is stupid.
Personally I'm quite happy with the Hong Kong / New York agreement, but if nothing is going to happen I'll reluctantly support bip148. It's quickly coming to the point (imho) that damage of continual impasse being worse than dangerous deployments like bip148.

Another +1 for BIP100. Just change "block size" for "block weight" (as defined by segwit) and change 75% for 90-95% (to give smaller players a powerful tool against being pushed out) and I think it's amazing =)

Silbert agreement is the compromise. It gives one side what they want (segwit) and gives the other side what they want (a hard fork, and an even further large capacity increase).
is currently in the process of bitching about it adding segwit, and is in the process of bitching about the hard fork. That's what makes it a compromise.
Luke's proposal on the other hand makes no sense. It's almost certainly going to end up being a net capacity decrease (as by the activation time, segwit and witness heavy transactions will be commonly used). There's approximately 1 person involved in bitcoin who actually has the appetite for capacity decrease. That number probably gets reduce to 0 if you're going to do it via a hard fork.  Furthermore, the proposal pretty much breaks whole point of the weight system. The way segwit was designed is that you sort transactions by weight/fee, and then pick the top 4M weight of transactions and call it a block. By having two different limits (2MB block, 4M weight) you now have a NP-hard problem. 
Luke's proposal is either delusional or just an attempt to add noise to disrupt a real compromise.

`bitcoin-cli estimatefee 6` is telling me I should use 0.00026881 BTC per KB to have a transaction, if I want to be sure it's confirmed in the next 6 blocks. The last simple transaction I made was 618 bytes, it might be a bit bigger than average with 3 inputs and 2 outputs, but it's pretty normal.
However, this means I should be using 16,223 satoshis in transaction fees, which is closer to 4 cents.  A far more realistic number, that matches my experience.

If we can get a fix for this, I'd also like to see [this revert]( reverted.

On a side note, I don't really understand the "virtual size" or "vsize" of a transaction. Why is that useful? Shouldn't a miner be trying to maximize the total amount of fees of fees they can fit in a block, not the fee/vsize?  Is this just to simplify the packing problem that is mining a transaction, or is there a reason I'm missing?
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:37:46
Eric is obvious technically right, however we currently have absolutely no semi-reliable tool to measure what the markets prefer. Without futures contracts (e.g. on bitfinnex), I'm not believing anyones claim (in either direction) of what the markets want or predict.
And secondly, a prolonged chain split that isn't persistent can potentially do a lot more damage than a persistent chain split. Imagine if the "original chain" (which is what you're on if you're using any released bitcoin client, and believe to be safe) gets wiped out by the segwit chain after a few days after the market eventually prefers it (and thus more profitable to mine on). The damage to people who were transacting on the original chain will likely be measure in the millions of dollars.
For a UASF to be endorsable, I really think we need futures contracts and public commitment of coin holders to dump their coins in a particular direction. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:09:01
I've given it a bit of thought, and starting to believe that perhaps the best way forward is indeed a clean chain split with a HF like this suggests. 
Personally I've found the high fees extremely painful and detrimental to my business. But I also respect that some people would prefer to leave the block size exactly where it is, for any number of reasons.
So perhaps an amicable breakup is best, and everyone picks which way they want to go and sells the coins on the chain they don't.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:54:08

I'm not sure that's necessarily the case. Let's say the extra capacity from segwit would cause the price to go up by 50% over a few months, but you'd also lose your secret mining advantage. The price increase might not be that appealing as you could probably assume that it would just lead to the hash rate going up by around the same amount in direct response. While losing your secret advantage would be pretty detrimental for expanding and staying profitable when others are forced out of the business.

I know this is going to annoy a lot of people on both sides of the debate; but I for one am just happy to see some real progress and an actual (band-aid) solution in sight. Huge fees, along with wallets not handling the backlog gracefully (e.g. even core's wallet doesn't directly support CPFP or non-trivial fee bumping (it only works if it can decrease from a change output)) which has made the bitcoin user experience rather embarrassing as of late.
It's not obvious though how they plan on doing the hard fork (as in, if there are any measure's to prevent a chain split or not), so that's something I'd really want to see before I can fully support the proposal. But otherwise I'm very happy =)

Or maybe you just got lucky. About 14 hours ago, bitcoin core were using 199 sat/byte fees as the default (and other wallets using pretty similar amounts). If you made a transaction then, it would still be stuck. 
Of course if you sent a transaction a bit before then, it would've confirmed fine. Or if you sent a bit after then when the fee estimation updated (to now 353 sat/byte!) then you'd also be fine.
But just because your 1 transaction per day hasn't had any problems, really means nothing.
FWIW: I've spent the last 14 hours replying to emails and doing customer support. It's been a huge issue, the worst I've ever seen.

It's probably a fair bit higher than a user who primarily sends money, but it's going to be a lot less than someone who primarily receives money (e.g. a merchant). 
I was originally planning on looking at the inbound fees to my wallet, but that's really quite hard as it seems most people send money from services themselves. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 02:46:02
Probably not that much. I haven't swept the wallet up in the last few days anyway, so there's none in the last 1000 transactions anyway. I've excluded them as they're kind of atypical, I do them mainly for security reasons (move them somewhere colder) but here is an example one:
@_date: 2016-10-09 19:33:52
Because they might know address A is a bustabit deposit address (they likely request one themselves). Now they send money to that address, and any address that gets spent with it in the same transaction is also therefor a bustabit address. And any address spent with that etc. They can keep spraying address A with dust to further the effectiveness. But another thing they can do, is track the change addresses (as outlined in this post) and construct an almost complete clustering of the wallet

I'm reluctant to talk shit, as I myself am equally as conflicted. I run a casino, and the increased network fees have directly cost me money and customers. 
I think though ultimately that no solution is strictly superior to the other, they both involve trade offs. How you use bitcoin, what you use it for, and what you want it to become will greatly affect the value you place in certain things.
So for me, I very much support segwit2x and will switch to it exclusively if it's deployed without issue. However, I certainly don't blame anyone who doesn't want to -- and hope they can continue to use the original chain with no disturbance.

First of all, I'd like to applaud you for not considering paying the protection money.
Probably the most prudent move is to move to OVH or Vultr hosting, both have some free rudimentary ddos protection. It's quite likely not going to be enough, but it's a good start. 
AWS often does a good job, but it's pretty easy to get destroyed on bandwidth fees if outgoing data is sent.  If the attack is a pure layer 3, I'd recommend just setting about ELB on AWS and it will completely eat it within a ~10 minutes. Layer 7 is going to be a bit of a bitch, but with nginx and if you can also scale your backend it's quite doable

It's worse (imho) because it's more coercive. For instance if the switching isn't clean people who are using the "original chain" have a persistent risk of getting wiped out, which isn't super fair to them. While if you have a contentious hard fork then neither chain faces that risk which removes the coercive element from it.

IIRC he tried to prove he was satoshi by signing a message from a public key known to be satoshis. The only problem is the message and signature he provided were lifted directly from the blockchain from a transaction satoshi made.
The guy is either a huge fraud, or satoshi going far out of his way to look like huge fraud. 
Honestly, I I don't really understand him. He obviously has some technical credentials to lift the signature from the blockchain -- which is enough for him to realize he'd be outted extremely quickly.

You can also create a transaction the spends from the change address with a really high fee. For miners to mine the one with a really high fee, they'll first have to confirm that transaction. So with CPFP they will confirm both in the same block. 
Unfortunately wallets don't really make this easy to do at the moment :(

I'm not really convinced that's the case. Segwit2x is pretty much just the spirit of the [hong kong agreement]( reified.
I'm a bit torn between thinking they're childish and egotistic for such rigid insistence on an agreement only signed by a few (noteworthy) individuals, but on the other hand I don't have much respect for someone who signs their name on something and then later tries to weasel their way out (and doesn't even have the courage to be frank about it).
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:28:24


No it's not. It's after 2016 blocks, which means it will be much earlier if there's an increase in hash power after the difficulty readjustment.

That's not how CF works. It's a reverse proxy that you funnel all your traffic through, and it scrubs all the shit (layer 3) and some of the layer 7 attacks. You should configure your servers to only respond to CF ips, and you should not make the origin ips public.
For example, bustabit.com uses CF -- but you have no way of knowing the ip address, and thus no way of even attempting to directly DDoS it.

That's not quite true. Bithra technically has the ability to run legitimately for a long period of time, and then pull an exit scam; while that's not really possible for bitrated.
Anyway, they've very different products and I don't believe competitors. Bithra is more of an alternative to sending money directly, while bitrated is more of a UI for multisig escrowed transactions and want to find someone to arbitrate.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:20:45
This is quite an extraordinary claim, do you have any proof of it?  Their public stance has been for bitcoin and segwit2x.
Anyway, I don't see what you possibly could have against Bitcoin ABC. imho Bitcoin ABC is the best thing to happen in bitcoin in the last couple of years.
It's pretty obvious there has been irreconcilable opinions on scaling trade-offs for a few years now. Having a clean divorce like this will undoubtably be better for everyone (after a few weeks of confusion while people try separate their coins). 
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:39:30
His argument is pretty retarded. It's the same FUD spun another way. It boils down to that if after segwit enforcement miners hard-fork to revert segwit and take all the segwit coins for themselves.
He then hypothesizes is 100% of the hash power did this, people/businesses would have no choice but to use the new HF which stole peoples money.
The thing about this attack is that in reality it has nothing to do with segwit. You can replace "segwit coins" with pretty much anything. Miners could create a HF today that allowed them to claim satoshis stash.  And by Peter's argument if 100% of miners mined on "steal-satoshis-stash chain" then users would just switch.
So not only is a "100% hash power attack" uninteresting, it's not a new attack vector and almost certain to never happen (the only thing it would achieve is the total loss of faith in proof of work).

The lightning network is pretty damn useful regardless of block size and transaction fees, and developed by a lot of people outside of blockstream.
 I think from the sidechains (e.g. liquid) are more likely a source of conflict of interest. AFAICT their value proposition is greatly reduced (but not nearly eliminated) by bitcoin being a cheap and reliable settlement network.
That said, I don't believe there's anything nefarious happening. I just think blockstream itself attracts people who hold certain beliefs in the trade-offs of bitcoin and their products reflect that.
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:54:32
Sure, but not that block. The only reason his transaction was in that block, was he called in a favor. (It would've taken a couple more hours before any 1 sat/byte transactions were organically getting mined)
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:44:19


No. That's not how it works at all. Under segwit there's not two separate limits, but just a single 4e6 weight limit, which was carefully designed so that it's impossible to create a block with &lt;= 4e6 weight, that would not be strippable to 1MB for legacy clients.  It's all pretty elegant. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 20:20:09
Sure, I wouldn't be holding the amount of coins I am if I thought there was a remote chance the halving could kill bitcoin. But my question wasn't "is the halving going to destroy bitcoin".
For instance, if even 10% of hashing power dropped off -- that could be a big deal. Both in terms of users trying to make bitcoin payments, but also it would make it significantly easier to DoS the network (with filling up the fewer blocks).
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:49:42


Nope. The alternate difficulty reduction only kicks in there's a sudden drop of ~90% hash rate, and will only adjust it so blocks are happening every ~hour (sorry, too lazy to do the maths).
 &gt; That's still the hard cap growth rate of Bitcoins being exploited.
Nope. If &gt;90% of BCC miners suddenly stop mining, have the difficulty drop a bit. Then mine until it readjusts. And rinse and repeat, you'd see that the inflation schedule gets pushed ahead a bit faster than expected.
It's not really a big deal though. The same thing pretty much happens with bitcoin, the inflation schedule has been pushed ahead by ~10% as we keep seeing increases in hash rate. (i.e. historically blocks have been mined with a frequency higher than 1 every 10 minutes)

I also think BCH is retarded, and Ver is sleazy. But bitcoin suffers from a problem where we have very little people who are very technical  and good at, and willing to publicly speak and engage with people like Ver. As a result they find the next best thing: some clowns like Vays, that make bitcoin look bad.

I think you just got exceedingly lucky. This is the first time this week that there's been a break in fee pressure. And right now, you need 408 sat/byte if you want to be in the first 1MB again. (See: estimatefee.com )
 
Suggesting people use extremely low fee rates only works if:
a) You don't care if it takes days/weeks
b) You can easily fee bump it if it gets stuck

Well you're right, just checked and all the old transactions &gt; 65 sat/byte have cleared out -- although for many of them that was a 3 day wait. 
Also every transaction in the mempool is eligible for confirming (or it's not added to the mempool). There's also an "orphan pool" for transactions that might not be valid (if their parents aren't yet seen) but it's extremely tiny
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:40:51
Since I'm responsible for a few megabytes of this, I'd like to explain.
I run a bitcoin casino, which means I have a wallet that continually grows in unspent outputs (people tend to deposit small amounts, and only withdraw if they win a certain amount). So even when the casino is breaking even, my utxo set keeps growing.  Merchant will also be in a similar boat as me. So when fees are low, I try to consolidate all the unspents together. Ideally I'd like to pay &lt; 3 sat/byte, so I aim to do it on the weekends. But for a few weekends that was never hit, so I ended up accumulating quite a lot of garbage to clean up. This weekend I got a few megabytes done at 1-3 sat/byte, which transaction sizes ranging from 50-100kb

@_date: 2016-07-28 21:49:44
You probably won't like my example, as it's from the part of bitcoin people like to selectively forget about. However, I run a big bitcoin casino (bustabit) and try to provide as much transparency into the operation (e.g. all the stats are public) as possible, but one thing I don't provide is proof of solvency, or perhaps more relevantly proof of actually having the claimed bankroll. 
It being standard for casinos to publish the bankroll (bip32 key) would be a be a big boon for players (e.g. recently a casino refused to pay out a jackpot win of &gt;1000 btc -- likely because they didn't even have it) but currently if it's not managed properly it would end up hurting players (funding going from or to the published bankroll would be too easily tied to bitcoin gambling, resulting in exhanges banning them)
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:52:59
You're actually half right. Vays had someone bump the tx, which allowed it to confirm a couple hours before it otherwise would've.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:47:16
Yup. The only thing that's going to make this messy is if people drag their feet and make it so. 
I'd also encourage everyone to read the Hong Kong Agreement from over a year ago:
I know there's a lot of bad blood on both sides, with both sides believing the other side broke the agreement. But if you take a step backwards, Segwit2x is in the spirit of exactly to what was agreed to back then.
I know the agreement isn't ideal, and the way the hard fork is being done is a bit reckless. But I really hope we can be mature enough to use our energy to make it work, instead of tearing it down.
@_date: 2017-06-22 05:11:25
You'll do a *lot* more for those people by making transactions affordable than making it easier to run a full node.
I run a full node (actually about 4) but I only do so for the businesses/sites I run. All my personal use is actually through light clients (on my desktop electrum with a trezor) or from my phone I use mycelium, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:29:49
That's not correct at all. I do not provide the address (you get it directly from bustabit), you just send the transaction through me.
Unless you're talking about the testnet version (which I do provide the address) and you'd be correct, but you're already sending into a blackhole anyway.  
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:28:30
You might want to look at estimatefee.com it makes it easy to eyeball what fee you need to be in the next block. (assuming the next block gets mined before a surge of transactions)
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:51:57
And there's really not much reason they need to store every transaction, they just need to know what's spendable and how how much it has (the UTXO set). 
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:40:36
Also a good indicator that you've achieved a compromise
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:16:08
Imagine the "legacy" chain is 100 blocks ahead of the bip148 chain, so when you send your transaction with nLock  of the the current best legacy block (by height) it means it will be immediately sent on the legacy chain, but the transaction itself won't be valid for another 100 blocks on the bip148 chain. So now you have 100 block timeframe to double-spend on the bip148 chain, thus splitting your money in a way that can't be replayed.
This is a technique that should only be done by extremely technical bitcoin users, as there's a lot of potential for confusion and losing money. 
On a side note, I think all this bip148 stuff amounts largely to FUD. AFAIK there's not a single serious mining or economic entity that is committed to using the bip148 chain. Unless something drastic changes, I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would expect a chain split. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 20:20:32
It's a soft fork, which means that the miners would have to be doing it (and enforcing it)
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:44:41
Well for all practical purposes neither does bitcoin, which really only requires full nodes to store the UTXO.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:39:11
There's also (my)  that shows the mempool and bitcoin core's direct fee estimation
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:38:14
Using nLock means that the transaction is valid when the block is &gt;= to it. To do something like what you're saying, you'd need to do CSV or something, which would require specially designed inputs.
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:15:00
Correct, the fee estimation looks at stuff for stuff that's been in your mempool for a while and *wasn't* confirmed to figure out what must've been too low, and it's all based on that. (And it's aware of things like CPFP and bip125 and what not)
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:39:27
Well this is certainly not the norm. I have dozens of transactions paying 5 to 30 bytes that have not been confirmed for over 2 weeks (i keep rebroadcasting them). (although some (but not all) of them paying 25+ sat/byte have been confirmed)
I actually believe that viabtc is still doing some priority based mining (along with their accelerator) so if your inputs were extremely old and huge, that could explain it. But it's absolutely not the norm (and testament to the fact is that there are hundreds of megabytes of transactions paying more than that)
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:42:45
I'm very familiar with how fee estimation algorithms work (and wrote estimatefee.com), and this trick doesn't work at all on any fee estimation I'm aware of. (And certainly not the common ones, like bitcoin core)
If you type in a transaction to:     you'll see an "effective fee rate" which takes into consideration the entire cluster (recursively checks children and parent to do a perfect effective calculation). 
Besides the simplest (sane) algorithm to sort the mempool is a simple topological sort (which ensures ancestors are before descendants). In this case it's not aware of CPFP, but the high fee paying transactions will rank lower then the low fee paying parents.
I can assure you, the ridiculously high fees are required for normal transactions. Just because once or twice a week there's a break in fee pressure and some low fee transactions confirm, doesn't invalidate reality.
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:21:01
I'm pretty skeptical (unless you used viabtc) considering there's dozens of megabytes of transactions paying higher than that. Got a txid?
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:57:12
I have a lot of respect for core, so I'll run their code regardless what happens. But if SegWit2x activates, I'll just apply a minimal patch to support the HF component.

I've added a source, but I don't think your deletes have been done fairly :P (e.g. The only company against segwit2x is also one of the only 2 without a source)
@_date: 2016-07-28 22:13:42
Absolutely. I would definitely be interested in deploying it if the tooling were there. For the hot wallet I use bitcoin core  (and looking forward to your next release, so I don't need to keep backing up the thing :P) and for cold storage use a trezor.
Bustabit only currently has 76.77 BTC in liabilities (players don't really keep much on the site. They deposit, play, withdraw) but people are playing against a ~1100 BTC bankroll.
So proving solvency publicly on just players money isn't a big deal, I can just set aside 100 btc for that that I don't touch. So the more relevant thing in this case is proving that I have the bankroll that they're supposedly playing against, without revealing exactly where the whole thing is
But I'd definitely be interested in putting it in production, as I'm also involved in another project that could use a proper private proof of solvency, so bustabit would make a good testbed for that
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:50:09
Yeah, actually happened to me too. I was sweeping a very old cold wallet, and didn't need the money any time soon, so picked a fee rate of 15 sat/byte. And a few blocks later much to my surprise viabtc actually mined it (and i didn't use their accelerator or anything), but when i looked at the mempool there was 2MB of transactions &gt;300 sat/byte. So definitely the priority thing, or someone surreptitiously submitting my transaction for acceleration (which I very much doubt) 
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:50:59
Kind of funny, I added my [companies position]( (which is probably at the moment the  bitcoin gambling site by volume), and seems like it was removed completely less than an hour later.

@_date: 2019-05-25 15:45:14
Ver clearly won this bet. The spirt of the bet is will it clear with 1 sat/byte, not "1 sat/byte + a favour from a miner".
He even admits he got slush to prioritize it for him. Ironically he *would* have won (the mempool cleared out a few hours later)  but let's not pretend this is anything but embarrassing for Vays.
Honestly, I wish "core" could get better spokesmen than this twitter clowns.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:53:22
No. For all intents and purposes, bigger blocks don't take any longer to propagate. This is because all the information of them has already pre-propogated (transactions in the mempool) and you just need to assemble them. See: compact blocks / weak blocks, etc
However block propagation itself will always be dominated by pretty fixed costs (e.g. the speed of light). Scaling via a block size increase is *hugely* saner than scaling via lowering block times.
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:05:32
It cleared everything last weekend =) But it's not 100% reliable (e.g. I had 3 or 4 weekends in a row it didn't)
@_date: 2017-06-21 04:38:16
I think it's still way too early to tell, but I suspect that we'll really see the impact after segwit is activated and again after the hard fork.  I'm like to try be optimistic, so don't take what I say too seriously: but I really do feel the best about bitcoin right now as I have in a long time. I think the long term prospects of bitcoin with segwit is fantastic (2nd layer stuff) and SegWit2x will buy enough time for reasonable priced on-chain payments that we don't lose our first mover advantage.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:57:26
Assuming the transaction uses p2pkh for everything, it'll be ~374 bytes. $7.10 is about 272000 satoshis. So, say: 727 sat/byte. That's like double what is required now, but looking the mempool there are a bunch of people paying above that -- so it's not unbelievable. 
To me the idea of a such small transaction requiring even a dollar of fees is ludicrous, but that's just me.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:53:44
Thanks BitFury!
There's obvious problems with the way the SegWit2x proposal was conducted (which gmaxwell did a great job of enumerating), but I'm really quite happy about its actual contents.
I think what a lot of people who don't directly deal with consumers don't fully appreciate is how poorly bitcoin has been functioning a payment network. It's slow, expensive and unreliable (at least for non-technical people, using normal wallets). I know 2 "real life" businesses that I used with bitcoin that have stopped using it because of support related problems. 
 I feel that SegWit2x will buy the ecosystem enough time to sort things out more gracefully, as well as allowing real 2nd-layer solutions to pick up the slack in bitcoin as a payment network and be better than ever before, and we don't need to keep bumping the block size as our only tool for future scaling.
(And there's certainly some stuff I don't like, like the sudden jump from 4M to 8M block weight which will temporarily kill the fee market, but I don't think it's reasonable to bikeshed over and it's really time to just move on)
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:59:35
Well said. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:38:51
Not in the immediate future. Segwit2x works in two phases, the first phase being activating segwit, the second phase being the hard fork. Only the second phase will risk a chain split, but there's not much point worry about that until the first phase is over, which you'll enough time to update/patch your node to support the block weight bump
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:20:06
I'm pretty skeptical of transactions &lt; 150 sat/byte reliably confirming  (without viabtc's help :P) in the last few days, considering there's dozens megabytes of transactions paying higher than that that isn't :P
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:37:14
Segwit wasn't opposed because it would reduce transaction fees miners would make. In fact, segwit would almost be a guaranteed increase in total transaction fees for miners, so it was blocked despite that.
With lightning it's not exactly as clear what would happen to miner revenue. If it is successful it would almost surely lead to each user making less on chain transactions -- which you'd at first would assume would be less mining fees. But I feel that the extra slack would just be absorbed by an increase in users and an increase in bitcoins price itself in response to the extra utility.
Not to mention I think people would be happy to pay more to open a channel than make a single payment. For instance I find it ridiculous it costs $2 now to send someone money, yet if I could open a persistent and reusable channel for $5 I wouldn't mind.
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:43:12
bip148 intends to fork even without any miner support or enforcement, segwit2x is miner activated which is generally believed to be a lot saner.

I think you're already seeing things quite clearly. 
The reality is that every one of those solutions involves trade-offs. None of them are strictly better than the other, and anyone who claims so is trying to deceive you.
Don't feel pressured to "support" any one of them, it's a lot more important to see them all for what they are (and their pros and cons).
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:28:17
The problem isn't the 300 sat/byte fee, the problem is they're charging you for sourcing all the inputs which isn't in your control!
The fair thing for services to do is charge a flat fee per withdrawal, optionally with a flat fee per deposit. The wallet consolidation they did shouldn't have been paid by you

Your only hope is going to be if a miner manually replaces it before the earlier one confirms. I don't think that's particularly likely, especially as they don't really have a way of knowing if you're intending to do this to defraud someone or not :(
I wish you luck though =)
