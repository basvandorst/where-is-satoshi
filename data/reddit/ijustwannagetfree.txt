One of three things is going to happen this year:
1) Bitcoin is going to fix its shit at least enough to be somewhat useful for a while longer
2) Another coin is going to take 
 
3) The entire crypto market is going to crash
There is no scenario in which Bitcoin can remain as it is, in the leading position, within a stagnant or growing global crypto market. Bitcoin is an embarrassment as the  and it will cause problems for everyone if not fixed or overtaken by a better coin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:51:40
I don’t think things are going to crash *that* bad. But I am really stressed and worried about the scene right now. I think the good tech will win out and benefit us all in the end, but I don’t know if I’m going to make my personal moon, anymore. We will see. Perhaps I’m just overly worried because I’ve made significant progress in the past few months and now the stakes are real. The next year could still as likely go well as badly. It won’t be as explosive as last year, but it could still be good. Even if the global market is stagnant, a lot of people could do well betting on rank changes.

The good's not on top now. There are plenty of other coins that would be more reasonable in  spot (Monero, Ethereum, Dash, to name a few) but aren't. Bitcoin wouldn't be anywhere near the top if it weren't the first player--it's propped up merely by name recognition and institutional privilege (Coinbase standard, trading pairs, etc.) at this point--not by the merits of its code.

I should say, I do think getting to a million with the amount of money in current USD that OP is talking about is a stretch but fully possible, I just don't think there's a close to realistic chance of doing so by dropping it all on BTC, specifically, and not touching it for 15 years. If diversified into smart investments that include coins other than BTC, and if traded at least every once in a while when long-term winds appear to be changing significantly, then, yeah, I think you have a definite shot at it with just $1-10k. That's basically what I'm hoping for.

@_date: 2017-11-02 19:35:18
For sure. I think it's probably got another strong few years left in it, and it probably makes sense to put money in BTC for short-midterm gains. 
In fact, I've played a bit risky recently and have dumped most of my altcoins over the past week to put ~75% of my funds into BTC to take advantage of the fork pump. I'm excited to buy back into alts at bargain prices with my gains! I will probably dump the BTC 4-10 days before the fork and move every cent out of there, because I'm smart enough to know I'm too dumb to anticipate how the post-fork chaos will play out--a catastrophe seems all too possible. I'll probably keep ~10% in Bitcoin Cash in case of a flippening. 
After the fork settles down, when a victor seems to emerge, I'll probably put a 10-20% in the dominant Bitcoin chain, as I do think 2018 is likely to be a really good year for it. It's gotta die eventually, though, and when it does I think it's going to die pretty hard.

@_date: 2017-11-01 21:42:00
Honestly, I'm a bit of a newb to this stuff, and no expert by any means, I'm just calling for some basic considerations for crypto investments. 
That said, I have been doing a fair amount of reading and thought over the past few months, and tbh I don't think Bitcoin is going to be worth all that much 15 years from now. It excels at nothing. Right now it's running on little more than brand name, and it's only a matter of time before it's crushed by already existing more nimble, more capable coins. My advice, if you're looking to invest for the long term rather than to spend much time trading, is to *diversify* and to try to spend some time researching coins and comparing their relative usefulness. Besides that plenty of other coins are much more capable, they've also got a lot more room to grow. Personally, my biggest hopes are for IOTA, but I'd never put everything on one coin.  
As far as total global crypto cap 10-15 years from now, who can really say, there are so many variables (I think the legal backlash is a particularly strong threat, as are security catastrophes, such as inevitable quantum attacks on coins that lack quantum-resistance), but in my mind $3-25 trillion seems like a much more reasonable conjecture, and there's a good chance that whatever coin comes out on top makes up at least 20-40% of that.

Five years from now, you'll wish you hadn't approached this thing in dogmatic, religious terms. There are plenty of coins far less elitist and more friendly to the common good than BTC. And there are plenty with a better chance of survival and growth than BTC, which has most likely got a few strong years left in it, max.

So if it was a woman-dominated forum, a contractor asked to be payed in Bitcoin,  and commenters' first thoughts were to joke about marrying him for his money, you'd be cool with being reduced to a success-object? (at least in that case Bitcoin use might imply financial success, whereas here sex doesn't have a damn thing to do with OP except that the existence of a woman was implied. The fact that so many men's first thought after any mention of a woman is "SEX" is a problem) 
Men aren't constantly reduced to 2-dimensional objects of sex utility, so a direct reversal doesn't carry the same weight. But if that began to happen all the goddamn time, of course it would suck for men, too.

I'll be honest: I don't understand derivatives. It seems like a pretty irrelevant market on this issue--i.e. one that crypto market cap won't be inflated by. But I can admit that I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to derivatives. 
Can anyone who's educated on this offer some insight? Could a large share of derivative values be absorbed by cryptocoins? Doesn't make sense to me, but I suppose it's possible. 
As to your second point, I'm not comparing the value of all money in the world to eventual number of Bitcoins but to the value of Bitcoin market cap, so I'm not sure what your point is. It seems obvious that the total value of the Bitcoin market could not possibly exceed the value of all money globally. . . and that, realistically, it will be a very small fraction of that value in 10-15 years time. A small fraction even if we believe crypto is wildly successful and Bitcoin remains at the top (I certainly don't actually believe the latter).
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:02:11

@_date: 2017-11-03 02:37:46
How did you reply to my comment without even reading it? I literally just pointed to the fact that it's shitty that men are often treated as success-objects. Are you actually incapable of processing nuance? I never fucking said men don't have significant problems of their own, dipshit. 
That said, your painting it as if that is for some reason the far worse situation is mindless, callous chauvinism--especially given that men are given the privilege of higher earnings, greater political power, greater social authority, and vastly reduced expectations of emotional labor, generally-speaking.
The gender binary sucks for both a lot of women and a lot of men. Asking you not to reinforce its detrimental effects on women doesn't equal support for its detrimental effects on men. How fucking myopic are you? 
In addition to all that, I'm a socialist and have a lot of sympathy for the way that workers have their labor exploited--and, yes, most of those workers, if we're considering only paid work, are men, but by a small margin, and that is decreasingly the case in a huge way. Look the fuck around you--what century do you live in that you think women aren't major contributors to the economic infrastructure? Nvm that they've been discouraged from being so and that when they aren't, they're usually raising your children, cleaning your house, taking on your emotional problems, cooking you meals, and sucking your dick even when they're not really feeling it--services that you apparently think are worth shit, nvm what your actions actually imply, if you have a married a homekeeper--but go on and act like men are the doers of all good things in the world if it makes you feel like a strong boy, hon. Inferiority complex has really done a number on you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:36:41
Lmao. No, it's not remotely realistic, and the fact that no one in thread has yet pointed that out (even though, granted, OP is clearly being a bit intentionally silly) is worrisome. 
That projection/hope would require the Bitcoin market cap to reach nearly the current global annual GDP in just 15 years. You're dreaming if you think there's a real chance of that. Total crypto cap for all coins is unlikely to be half that high that soon, even if wildly successful (assuming, for example, we don't start running into momentum-killers like serious legal pushback), and it's really naive to think Bitcoin is likelier to still be leading that pack than not 10+ years from now. 
Y'all need to stop extrapolating from historical data that the rate of growth can just continue at the same or a greater factor for eternity. We will eventually run into economic limits and inflection points that shrink profitability  with *any* coin, and it's important to invest with that realistic grounding in mind. We're in crypto at a good time, but it won't always be as lucrative.

You make it sound like every other coin is a simple copy-paste of the Bitcoin code that adds nothing. This is so patently false it’s hardly worth arguing about (did you just discover crypto 3 days ago?)—Iota for example is wildly different.
To say that Bitcoin devs are best is subjective and unfalsifiable, but it’s quite clear to me that Bitcoin does not have the best, most feature-rich code by a long-shot, so it’s clear to me that it’s devs either aren’t the best or it doesn’t matter that they’re the best, because they’ve parked themselves on dead tech. To imply that other coins don’t have extremely sharp devs at the top of their fields is, again, obvious religious tribalism.

How's this for a more apples-to-apples comparison:
A fairly generous estimate of the value all the money in the world--including gold, stocks, outstanding debt, etc.--is ~$200 trillion ( 
Do you really think a *single* cryptocoin (much less Bitcoin specifically) has a decent chance of taking an over 25% share of that value in just 15 years?
The total value of all USD is a fraction of the above-cited $~200 trillion and nowhere remooootely fucking close to the astronomical *quintillion* you just pulled out of your ass.

I mean, Bitcoin isn't really a fraud, but it's pretty deficient compared to several of the coins that are going to overtake it. Does being hugely overvalued make it a fraud? 
It's strange to me the mass amount of people who actually think Bitcoin is a smart long-term hodl. Relatively speaking, it excels at nothing--not even at functioning as a simple medium of exchange.
