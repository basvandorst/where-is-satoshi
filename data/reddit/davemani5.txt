So a block erupter would prob take approx 3 months (assuming difficult keeps increasing) or so running just to recover the approx $3 in there. 
I guess I'll h have to think if it's still worth it, lot of effort for j just $3.

Well damn, why'd they even give me a btc address then. Thanks for the info though

Not against trying by all means but it sounds like deep bit would have to win a block to get paid and that doesn't sound likely. So I may be sol. Thanks for the offer though

The simplest way for bars right now is to take money up front in btc and then give them a preloaded card they can use at the bar and the tender can Swype. 
I've seen similar things at wine bars where you get the card up front and load it up. Personally I'd like that so I don't get drunk move a decimal and tip a full btc.
Only a short term solution though as I'd like to see them take btc directly eventually.

Really nice. Personally I'd like to see the same information in like Cards. A lot of the information is still horizontal so not a great exp on mobile and that would fix that. That said infinitely better

I think a service which creates a paper money securely and mails it to a user would help solve some issues.  This process (although simple) is too tough for my parents and tech-scared people.
If merchants were given this paper money they could then throw up an address and take all the money they'd like (for goods/services) and not have to worry about security.  Hopefully some sort of bank would be able to take this note and exchange it.
It may not be "the" solution, but it's "a" solution.

Was just thinking somewhere someone could create a list of known bad addresses where they've gotten stolen bitcoins.  But problem is they can quickly transfer them to thousands of addresses as boxingdog mentioned :(

Good point.  I was just trying to think of ways to help people in case of the event they're stolen.

Nice- I'm glad there was something useful in this idea of mine.  Good luck with that idea.

Yeah thats a good point, but I figured the first step is to identify that you've lost bitcoins. Perhaps there could be a blacklisted address then?

Can someone elaborate how it can be divided an "infinite" number of times? I thought it only went to 8 digits aka "satoshi"
