That's a fair point in the grand scheme of things. I do believe in bitcoin and have been holding since 2013. This just feel like a really obvious bubble, so OP would be able to buy a bit more bitcoin if he waits just a little bit more.
I guess no matter what, OP is making a good decision investing in Bitcoin.

What about the FCC and their regulation of the Internet and net neutrality? I certainly do not trust Comcast, Time Warner, or Verizon to do the right thing. They will gut the Internet if they can privatize it. Taxes have their part.

Everyone's suggestions here are excellent. I would definitely follow their advice in a few months, but do not buy right now. We are currently in the middle of a bubble. If you truly believe in Bitcoin and want to get involved, wait for the price to normalize again before buying into it.

I just wanted you to know that I started using your app to store my bitcoins instead of Coinbase about a month ago. I am very happy I made the switch. Thanks for making such a simple and secure app!
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:21:31
That's what I thought. Thank you. I will continue to HODL.
@_date: 2016-06-17 02:24:59
I don't plan on it. Thanks! I'm going to hold until the tax process becomes a bit easier. I'm confident in the technology, so I don't mind holding through the ups and downs.

The price in 2013 was from the bot at Gox. Not the halving. Any charts being extrapolated from that data should be ignored.

PNC doesn't mind me buying coins from Coinbase.

It's cool.

Not in the app. I'll check their site.
Edit: No transactions yet on my account. I triple checked the address and it is correct. Maybe it's in limbo?

I use 2FA on my email, so I should be pretty safe.
Good tip for those with weakly secured emails.

Thank you. I'll keep refreshing my android app and let you know when it appears.
Thanks again!! I'm really excited to see this all work. You're the man/lady!!!

Good luck. If you get 10+ btc, would you really donate or just disappear. Haha

You should have a giveaway to a bunch of new users to get them interested in BitCoin. Maybe $5 per person. It would be enough to get someones hands dirty.

Was that in one transaction too? Wow. That's a big buyer.

Connect your account, then tell the bot to withdraw all to your account.
It's sorta confusing. I just did it the other day for the first time after some trial and error.

I don't doubt that we will top 1000 again. Best of luck and congrats on the smart investment.
I'm still nervous about coinbase with my bank info. I'll pull the trigger eventually. It looks so appealing.

This guy! Education is much more important than money. I accept your tip!
Edit: oh god, you gave me debt. Nooooo!
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:04:01
I'm going to... Invest! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:47:20
It worked!!! Wow that was easy. Thanks so much. That was awesome!
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:54:47
Wow, glad to see a happy ending to your story. Once the market goes back up, you'll gain a considerable amount of money. Perhaps enough to tip some new friends? Haha
I kid. Congrats and good luck. I don't trust coinbase with my bank account information, so I have yet to buy bitcoins. I'm at 35 cents from tips. Once a trust worthy site opens, I'll buy some coins.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:38:23
If I was close I would. That's awesome,
