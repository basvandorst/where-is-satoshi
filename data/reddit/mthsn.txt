Okey so in the future, the superpowers will fight for miningoperations. Wouldnt that make the system superfast/superstabile? (Unless they decide to shut it down)

What kinda bothers me ( just a random conspiracy thought) 
This Satoshi got millions of bitcoin. And if bitcoin ever becomes some sort of worldcurrency, 1btc is worth insane amount of money.  We'll have this person satoshi, with more btc's than whole countries combined? And we'll have a  new world order/illuminati? 
/from someone with no economy background or vast knowledge of how btc/money in general works. 
Please let me know if this thought is possible,weaknesses.. I dont know, just hand me some arguments :)
