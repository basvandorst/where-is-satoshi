Forget about consumer protection when dealing with bitcoin... Smart contracts are at least 6 months away...

Thanks, looking forward to it! 
I'd appreciate a discount, would love to spend some quality time with you guys at the Burj Kalifa, just feel like $300 is too steep for a ticket. Yes, i know its Dubai, UAE, land(desert) of the rich but at the current exc. rate its just too much.

Just like last time this clown will not get a single btc. He is using the auction for his own promotion. The bids his 'syndicate' placed are a joke.

Where are the pictures of this rock ?
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:57:01
No it wouldnt. Bitcoin is not an alt coin, it will never be rolled back, for whatever the reason. Days of rollbacks are long gone.

Ive asked in the previous thread, unanswered, here it goes again : 
What was your TeamViewer password ? Did you ever connect to TeamViewer via a TOR socks5 connection? 
Trying to figure out if the attackers brute the password/client ids or sniff it via tor exit nodes..
EDIT: Did you leave your client ID anywhere on the web ? 
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:31:57
Bitstamp ?
@_date: 2014-12-06 12:24:15
What was your TV password ? Asking to figure out if it was brute-able or not.
EDIT : was it a default 4 digit or you set up your own ?

No it wont, otherwise it would not be decentralized. No entity has the power to rollback the blockchain now.

Big miners are not selling any bitcoin, they are in it for the long run. All costs associated have been covered on launch, for at least a year in advance.

Unbelievable...
