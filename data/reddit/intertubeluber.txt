You don't have to turn on the red light.

I bet my solid gold dreidel there is a strong correlation between holding antisemitic views and spelling _charade_ the way you tried.

Right. If OP is an economist, this fact doesn't lend credence to his post, it discredits the entire field.

What do you mean "making money"?  Being speculated on?  How does it make sense to compare Bitcoin to a company?

Feinstein is probably responsible for about 90% of boating accident.  I don't think the phrase "freedom hating" has ever entered my mind in a serious way, except regarding her.

Exactly. OP lacks a fundamental understanding of human nature. There are a million ways "the elite" can stop crypto and/or integrate it in a way that it's something they control.  
And if they can't, the end result won't result in a freer society, but a lot of misery, hitting the poor the hardest, followed by less freedom.

This will definitely work out for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:40:00
For sure.  I guess you'll have to ask the people currently manipulating the value.

If OP wants to be judged on substance alone, he shouldn't claim credentials as a reason to trust him.

The USD will absolutely be worthless someday, as with all currencies.  But it's been around for over 240 years and is currently the standard by which all other currency is measured.  Gold was first used as a currency 550 years before sweet lil' baby Jesus first sucked on his mommy's titties.  Bitcoin has been around for 9 years.  *9 years*.  That's nothing.  Crypto may very well revolutionize the concept of currency, but it's too early to tell, and certainly too early to have any idea which crypto will play a role or in what capacity.

We truly are living in miraculous times.

Uh... Nope.  I meant I had never seen it in the context of my original post. I really don't give a shit one way or the other. I already unsubscribed from r/btc.  I can't say I'm getting much from this sub either.
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:26:01
I don't at all now, and never did a ton.  The only reason to visit was to watch the drama.  Nobody needs that.
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:54:46
Proof?  That sub is a pure propaganda machine but I've never seen anyone banned.
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:20:23
I'm no expert, just sharing my experience as a person who peruses.  I've seen heavily (obviously manipulated) downvoted posts, just haven't seen the actual ban.

It's a soap opera...
