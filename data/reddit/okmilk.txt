Any newbies reading this - the corrections will keep coming. The pattern is the same going all the way back to 2009. This is NOTHING NEW. Just keep hodling and everything will be alright. The fees and tx times are being solved by Segwit and Lightning, it just takes time and we need to stay together in the face of the attacks on bitcoin.

And they said PoW was bad for the environment. Hah!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:49:30
I just need rent money for January, and all my capital is in BTC. Stressed out, but I know if I keep hodling and find the money elsewhere I'll be a happy camper by February. Love you guys!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:54:35
That happened.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:12:24
No. Plenty of dogs that need adoption out there.

Question: will you be removing our bank account details from your databases now that we're back to Level 1?
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:27:56
Boo! I understand though, you do seem to run a strictly by the books business. And such a clean interface too. Much sadness about this news. :/

Quality post, thank you.

Quality comment.

Kinda weird to see so many comments here praising a "president". Aren't we trying to get rid of ancient titles and centralized structures of control?
Wake me up when the government is on a blockchain.

It's a correction. This is how bitcoin works. Hodl strong and proceed with buying more at the bottom (just a wild guess, but $1300-$1500 seems reasonable).
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:56:43
Well that's a bold statement!
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:11:55
Looks like you got one. :) We'll see how low this one dips.
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:14:10
More or less. The wildcard is what will happen with scaling. If we're really at critical mass, and mass adoption will occur in the next 2 years, then scaling will make or break bitcoin.
IMO, if the number of users starts to increase exponentially but the tech doesn't evolve bitcoin will die and a technologically superior altcoin will take it's place.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:29:26
Or this is just the beginning of mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:16:54
I mean.. you're not totally wrong. Everyone above a certain net worth doesn't care, but it will price out the little guys. :/
On the other hand, there's dozens of altcoins for the little guys to use, so now that I think about it - we're all good.

All currencies have a lifespan. Why would the dollar be any different? 
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:18:35
So that would potentially mean a 100x price increase right? $170,000 a coin and I'm buying a house in Bali. Shit, make it a compound with multiple houses for any family and friends that want to join.
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:18:58
Well, Litecoin already has SegWit, so that's an advantage over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:42:50
Preach on brother.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:33:14
Yeah, I'm not saying it's going to be Litecoin specifically, just making the point that it's easier for an alt to be ahead technically. They're more like agile startups, while Bitcoin is the IBM of the crypto space. Bitcoin has become a giant, and the bigger something is the harder it is to change.
With all of that said, I still think brand recognition is far more important than tech at this point. And maybe transaction times and fees don't really matter if it becomes the digital gold rather than the digital dollar.

Japan, use case  is store of value.  is for daily transactions.

The price drop is a good thing! There was no way that parabolic rally was sustainable. A correction will reset the market for the push to $2k.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:30:05
Welp, looks like we're good on that one! And the solution works for short + medium term. Good times ahead.

Do you understand what the blockchain is? It's a way to decentralize pretty much any process/entity. Examples: courts and court decisions, the DMV, funding of public projects, corporations, contracts, military/defense decision making, etc, etc. Instead of one person, agency, company being in charge of any of these things - they can be decentralized and operated by a "swarm" of people.
What's happening with bitcoin politics right now will in part help shape how all of those systems can be implemented while reaching almost perfect consensus on issues. We are living in exciting times! This is the Internet in 1992.

Check all major tech publications - they're focusing on the NSA angle. CNN Tech, Arstechnica, TechCrunch, TheHackerNews, all have "NSA tools/leak" in the title somewhere.

The memes are back! Pop the champagne.

Oh man, I love that quote. Well done, have an internet point on me.
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:06:46
You never pull out of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:02:30
That was my story.

Was about to upvote you but then I saw the "/s". You shouldn't have done that friendo.
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:45:56
lol this comment is the best thing ive seen today
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:06:15
Keep hodling. Anything under $10k is a steal this year.
