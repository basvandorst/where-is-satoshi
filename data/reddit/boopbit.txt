Your options are limited as a minor.  I would explain to your parents that they should help you acquire bitcoin with their identities so as to protect your own(their child).  Also explain that if they don't help, your only options are to meet some stranger in person and do they really want you doing that?  Are they willing to come along for an in person meeting?
  
Lay out the options for them and explain in a clear way that not acquiring bitcoin is not an option for you because you are thinking about your financial future.  Most parents would get behind that.

This isn't just about mining.  When you watch Balaji speak, he speaks about creating closed loops in the ecosystem and a mining solution on its own is not a closed loop.  He's talking about mining plus value added integration.

If Satoshi sold all of his coins at once on the open market the price would go down.  But that is a temporary and good scenario since we will know it is done and can't happen again.  And I will rejoice because I will never have to see another one of these submissions again.

It's a total joke.  Manifestos mean shit when a lot of money is on the line.  The core developers are working on it and discussing it and there is no immediate need, just an imminent one if adoption continues.

Describe catastrophic.  Satoshi's coins moving wouldn't be catastrophic on its own.  What matters is the details surrounding the move and the market conditions at the time.
  
If bitcoin gets into the thousands per coin, no one is going to bat an eye at him moving coins and many would see it as Satoshi taking some profits and would wish him well.

I am for a blocksize increase but I am against moving away from core.  I am confident we will get an increase with core.

I do not believe that your girlfriend sent you back bitcoin(money) and said "Do you remember those bitcoins you gave me back in December? I just transferred them back to you. I'm sure there is some use for bitcoin somewhere, I just don't see it.".

I know you have been around long enough to know that you are being manipulative by saying that.  It takes one person with a little bit of resources to put something on the front page, that doesn't mean that a significant portion of the community is for it or put it there, and you know that.  And in fact, some of you butters(not saying you) have done that very thing in order to troll this sub.

I wouldn't mix them if you are planning to send them back to coinbase eventually to cash out.  You can always mix them but you can't get back the original coins coins that coinbase provided and there is zero chance they will give you a hard time about coins that were sent to cold storage and then sent back to them.  If you mix them, you may end up with other coins that coinbase will question.

Sounds like an uninformed excuse.  The developing or 3rd world as it's often referred to is one of the biggest use cases for bitcoin.  3rd world economies can be extremely volatile and oppressive in terms of the government backing them, bitcoin helps with that tremendously.  Look at countries in South America like Venezuela for examples.
