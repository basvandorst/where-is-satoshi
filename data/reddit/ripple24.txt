Cody is right as usual.

I would be happy if I could buy a Walmart gift card with Bitcoin. But they don't even allow third party sellers of their cards.

Only pertains to Bitpay but he was probably referring to this: 
BitPay, the largest and oldest bitcoin payment processor with a daily volume of $1 million bitcoin transactions supporting more than 44,000 merchants, stated in an email exchange to CCN that more than 4,400 of their merchants keep all of their settlement in bitcoin, almost 18,000 keep some of their settlement in bitcoin while the remaining 22,000 convert it all to fiat.

Cheapair.com accepts bitcoin for flights (and has for over a year).

Not going to happen. Coinbase was founded by an ex-Goldman Sachs exec that has made it clear he doesn't care about bitcoin's ideological underpinnings - they're only in it to make more $.

The biggest barriers to adoption are the literal barriers to adoption - the AML / KYC laws. Not sure how they're going to be overcome. Perhaps some sort of Open Bazaar style decentralized exchange.

His father was a U.S. senator. I think it is a safe to say he's always known some powerful people.

Not too many options with AMEX. 
You could buy something at a store and immediately return it for cash. Then use the cash to buy bitcoin through localbitcoins (by depositing it at a bank or meeting up with someone in person).

Braintree is owned by eBay. This is one of the biggest companies on the internet dipping their toes into the water. Far from the same old crap IMO.

Bitcoin is not a replacement for credit cards. It is a free-market currency that challenges the fiat monetary regime. It is a complete paradigm shift. The benefit to being able to pay Uber in Bitcoin is obvious when you consider that an entire new ecosystem is being built from scratch.

I'm pretty sure the OpenBazaar people are working on an exchange as part of the project. At least they were when they did an AMA here a while back. 
I don't see why it wouldn't be viable. In fact I see it as a fundamental necessity for Bitcoin's long-term survival.

Bitcoin exists outside of the status-quo monetary regime. Eventually it will help to protect people from the inflation tax - the most  insidious tax there is. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 18:23:13
Yes, centralized alternatives currencies have been created (and subsequently shut-down) in the recent past. E.g. Norfed Liberty Dollars and E-Gold. Having a counterparty made them easy targets. 
Bitcoin probably could have been crippled by government early on (by going after exchanges and such), but they mostly failed to act and now we're past the point of no return.
@_date: 2015-03-19 06:35:21
In order to reach that tipping point there first needs to be a way to trade fiat for BTC easily, inexpensively, anonymously, and securely. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 18:02:58
Because monetary policy is the most surreptitiously powerful tool governments have. It is essential to the big government world many people want. They hate that bitcoin gives individuals a choice to opt out of their social-engineering scheme. 
Simple as that.

Well LBC is kind of a misnomer since most of the transactions on there are anything but local. 
Anonymity is about a lot more than drugs. It is about not wanting the federal government to know you are involved with a revolutionary counter-economy that runs opposite to their own ends. It is about not wanting the IRS to come knocking if and when BTC goes to the moon.
Anyway hopefully LBC is just a stopgap until decentralized exchanges come into the mix.
@_date: 2015-02-17 21:30:26
People are always worried about scams on LBC but I think it is a red-herring. Just use a seller with good feedback and a high number of transactions. 
I like to push LBC because it can be anonymous. IMO a big part of Bitcoin is its underground nature. Giving up all your info to Uncle Sam to save a few dollars or minutes doesn't really make sense to me.

This is where you separate the liberals from the libertarians. Libertarians believe people own their own bodies.

The top listed seller on localbitcoins.com (for me at least) - with 70+ ratings at 100% - is charging 221.35 USD. Bitstamp is $217.73. He accepts Cash deposit.  
You're not going to find a better or cheaper way to anonymously purchase Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 21:05:28
It takes 5 business days or so to go through Coinbase because they do a ACH withdrawal from your checking account, which takes time to clear. They charge a 1% fee IIRC. Circle gives you the option to use a credit card but that might result in a cash-advance fee. 
Your best bet is probably to go through localbitcoins.com. There you can buy from a trusted seller by depositing cash into their bank. There you can expect to pay around a 2% fee but unlike Coinbase (or Circle) it is instant and anonymous. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:41:32
How about LocalBitcoins? Just use a highly-rated seller. I think you can make a cash deposit at the seller's bank. (I've never personally used it but it seems to work well - expect to pay a premium though)
@_date: 2015-02-06 02:30:23
Yes you're right - I should have played that angle as well. It is backed by the distributed network.  
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:14:20
A lot of their articles seem concern-trollish in nature, or just straight up FUD - especially the headlines.
@_date: 2015-02-17 21:25:49
OK never used circle, I just read about people using their CC having to pay cash advanced fees, but I guess that's an exception. I knew about the Coinbase visa thing too, but doesn't that first require verification?

It is pretty good -- Greek-style. On sale for $10 for a large cheese. 
The guy seemed a little concerned that there's nothing "backing it", but I quickly explained how the lack of counter-party risk forms the entire basis for the currency. That alternative currencies with "backing" have existed, and have been shut down by the government because they have a central point of failure. He understood.
