When it tanked, I was still up 50%.  Also, I didn’t buy in with more than I could lose.  It’s more like a videogame.
Just like any limited resource, regular purchases over time is better than trying to time the market.  I’m hesitant to call it an “investment”, but the current ecurrencies finction similarly.

Bitcoin is about a decade old.  It is not in its infancy.  It is mature, and struggling with age related issues. 
In this case, whale would be anyone holding a large percentage of the active coins at any given time. 
In 20 years, there will be roughly the same number of coins in circulation as today.
Today, there are about 16.75m coins in circulation.  Roughly 1800 per day are minted right now, but that halves periodically.
The maximum number of bitcoins will be 21m in the year 2140, which is about 30% more than today, minus burnt and lost coins.
Someone holding 30% of bitcoins now, holding to 2140, woukd still have 25% of the coins.
It’s like when people think you could sell all of the stock for all of the companies and give the cash to the workers.  You cannot, because the value is in the holding, not the selling.
Same with bitcoins.  Here, we had how many BTC sold for BCH, and it dropped BTC value by 20%.

BCH is like a zombie.  Why won’t it die!  Maybe we can trade all of the forks and have infinite money!  /s

No.  It’s possible because every crypto starts with a fat wallet at ICO.
Imagine if the head of a reserve bank had direct, unrestricted access to the reserve funds and no restrictions on use other than their inner voice.
There is always the risk of a whale cashing out.
