I believe shares of gbtc are now closer to .09 a bitcoin that .10.  That would still carry a sizable premium if $621.45  per btc.  I have not read the perspective or filings in a long time, so might be wildly inacvurate.
Edit.  Looks like.09556 actually and there are no more than 167 holders of gbtc, could be as low as 70 per the filing.

Why couldn;t we just take the block chain, make it a distributed torrent and when a transaction occurs, pull the relevant piece of the chain to confirm?  When I was thinking of this a few days ago, I thought" Is that the lightening network people talk about" as the act of doing tracing transactions backward through torrent would be reminiscent of a lightening bolt. That is not what it is, to my knowledge, but wouldn't this distribution of chain, assist in scaling.  I know 2.1 quadrillion tokens might be cumbersome or too slow to make this viable...  But an algorithm should burn through that data.  Best guesses as well.

Alt coins are performing well right now.  Alt are basically a derivitive play on BTC. When BTC goes up alt do as well, as there is an acceleration of gains.  For example, you buy .1 btc and then buy 500 Cloak.  As money flows into the Alt markets and Cloak released their POSA3 wallet and Onemarket over next 6 months, price grows by 3 to 50 x Concurrently BTC goes up 2 to 4 x.  Gains on top of gains.  On the top line you could have 20 BTC.  It is insane I know, but look at literally every Alt from November 2013.  Every single one.   I suppose you could lose your .10 BTC, but that risk/reward ratio.  My My...  Also, Have to shout out Globalcoin here, GLC to the moon!  And Cryptsy, the oldest and perhaps most volumed of the Alt coin markets over two years old, had some trading bottlenecks in Nov. 2013, but infrastructure is much improved today.

$35,680, nice.  Apple has that market capitalization of ~3/4 a trillion dollars, mind blowing.  But Bitcoin has potential to be worth $1 million per BTC.  Sounds insane, but that would be a market capitalization of $21 trillion or roughly the size of the size of the USA economy/total US debt burden in ~5 years.  The US debt was only 3.3 trillion 25 years ago and is now 18.235 trillion today. So it has grown 554% in 25 years.   
BTC has potential to touch everything asset.  The more I use it, the more I am blown away by the legacy system's inefficiencies.  The processes that concern me as to not reaching these levels are consolidation of mining(thus allowing legacy system to remain and adapt), government aggression, and sidechains taking value out of the system into there own microsystem.   The last is both utility of the protocol for good but also a siphon of value.  A net positive or net negative, not sure.
But to the OP, Cheers.  We are one in only a relative hand full that see what is so apparent.

They are not bitcoin, they are parrallel systems that run along side bitcoin and use it for whatever purpose that have a use.  That is my limited understanding.  Obviously sidechains can be very much varied from one to the next, depending on their purpose. But, they mostly take traffic from the blockchain as to enjoy the network benefits, but extract as much value as possible.  While they will also add value, it must be important that btc can mostly do the east stuff at a high level in regards to speed and bandwidth.  Sidechains should not be for the low lying fruit, which is where most of the value is and why we have network squabbles.  Side chains should be specialized and protected by ip.  That is not going to be very defensible though as I can't imagine novel art in the space.  To without those barriers to compotetion, the best path is to ramp down btc and build a sidechain that is agnostic to which network so that fees and be siffoned from and and all chains.  But rambling now, but I think that paints the picture as to the why the infighting.

I would have 1gb blocks and all rails built on top are superfluous in ways, but integral to facilitating various of blockchain utilities.  So sidechains will facilitate but are not necessary.  2nd that should not be trying to usurp the blockchain function.  That will lead to a more flawed system and it is wholly unecessary.  Backers of these sidechains are wanting to maximize their exposure to the few market, which is fine, but the development community as a whole should not stand for the the money interests putting the network on a failed path.  Security is paramount, scaling is needed, but the miners can handle much larger and faster blocks. Again, sidechains should facilitate the use case and be tailored to industries.  Blockchain should be huge, fast, and dumb.  Sides being application specific.

Bff needs to be much more robust.  I will like to see on chain transactions that can be viable computation for next layer transaction.  
Beyond that, miners secure the network.  In 7 years that subsidy is 3.125 btc.  Transaction volume in chain has to increase dramatically to make sure that bitcoin continues.

Nailed it.  It is a 10 to 15 year process we are looking at.  There is a previous metal speaker that has great presentations on the cycle.  Pretty much everything he has stayed has occurred and I supose he has been researching this for decades.  Deflation followed by hyperflation seems to be the Fed's direction we are headed.  Takes a long time to unfold however.  The network will continue to build our and become more viable every year.  It will happen, just need be working towards that ends.  i saw video in the internet 1996 a few days back where they were prodicting internet users of 25 million by 1998.  Unbelievable.

Was trying to grasp the implications of this and it would be great it the chips would connect to the peer to peet pool and not a 21 pool.  Would be ideal for obvious reasons and assuming 21 could get the contracts to supply the chip set for all devices, they would be good monetarily, but if course they would be leaving money on the table from subsidy and fee share, so that won't happen.  
There needs to be regulation of use of part to peer pool.  To help decentralise the process.

I think a more interesting thought is that all chartered banks in the USA could integrate a blockchain of their own design and have each bank being a node, thus benefiting from the tech while controling the infastructure.  I would surmise this is the direction, that US currency will go.  With the reach of US financial instruments, this could touch a great deal of people in the world.  Of course private firms will do likewise.  While this does seem to marginalize Bitcoin value, the CTO of Microsoft said semi-recently, he sees 4 or so transnational cryptocurrencies in the next 25 years.  USA dollar, Euroblock, China, and Bitcoin.  This makes tons of sense,as the the 3 main national currencies will have defacto standing and the internet money that is a public private hybrid with miner,merchants and users all having a stake in its utilization and it being capped at 2.1 quadrillion units, without the inflation and deflation of money supply is a solid structure.  BTC is a valuable piece to the global system. No source will be provided :)  cursory google search will corroborate.

US tax return money mainly, driven by the halvening expectation and road map of capacity being firmed up within the industry.   Should see a consistent, yet accelerating price until vertical in to $800s in the next few months, followed by crash of ~40% an then repeat through September to some point high and retrace to sustainable level, then side ways to tailing down until next big news or decent industry paradigm shift over the next few years.    
The next halvening in 2020 will be the big one, the real test to bitcoin, as far as mining transitioning from subsidy to transaction fee base.  This is contingent on user increase, which only happens, if the infrastructure being built comes to market in a truly user friendly way.  At that time, price could be at levels of today or truly mind boggling heights.  Bitcoin really needs to continue to cement itself as the blockchain of choice for users through that time frame and the fight should be won for the next 10 to 20 years. 
If a true competitor gains transaction, this would definitely muddle the picture.  R3 may be the most dangerous as it has institutional connection, the ability to roll out and compress margins to a level that makes adoption of bitcoin less appealing.  This is tried and true business strategy, along with monopoly encouraging  regulation,  for  decades.  That being said, Bitcoin has it advantages of its own right, paramount perhaps being the fact that it is mostly outside of the current financial system.  
So many varables, but it is going to be interesting to say the least.  Get your tickets, enjoy the ride and learn as mucbh as you can from the experience.  Taking part of this kind of investing opportunity happens maybe 3-4 times in a lifetime.  We are lucky to be here at this time, because BTC is unique in that it is publically traded during its growth stages.  The twitters and facebook and ubers are all privatleyu held during the grow stage and are offered from public sale when they are at extremely high valuation, maximizing returns from early investors and limiting the returns to the public participants.  Facebook IPOed at 104 billion, roughly 15 times the value of BTC.  Facebook was worth 6.6 Billion at one point as well, when it was growing.  Twitter IPOed at 25 Billion.  In 4.5 years, with users increases hopefully at at least 10 x today's levels and growing at an appreciable rate, the price could be jaw dropping.
Again, these are exciting times.

They want the Money and power.  They have interests, but bit ultimately is about what best services the ecosystem.  I do not know enough to know, but gravitate toward larger blocks sooner rather than later.  Ready to abandon the subreddit if there is an alternative.

Yeah, marketing to a worldwide user base of ~5 million is a niche task.  That is, it should not be a priority.  If you have a spare minute to construct a " Bitcoin is cool , $10% off sale" and post it to literally here, then great.  But Bitcoin is ultimately huge and unconcerned and unaware of most everything. It just is. And will continue to grow.

Why do fools voice stupid opinions.  Markets market. The bitcoin markets have matured from the 2013 bubble with more robust shorting and options markets.  You act like this is some thinly veiled conspiracy, but really markets have players of various capital means that they can use to gain additional capital.  but it is dangerous for them as money can be made by shorting them to hell.
This remains to be one of the most exciting markets in the world and will continue to be so for a long while.  Go take up a hobby or go buy a bluechip, moron.

There are about three or four serious anonymous alt coins.  They really just obfuscate the identy of the sender.  Dash and Moreno use master nodes, while Cloak is wholly contained in client, from my understanding.  I think they are basically auto mixing coins, but I don't really know.

I heard they have been processing btc/alts much faster. So long as you are not sending more than $2000 a day/$10000 a month in crypto and have verified minimal info. They are working for a higher level of compliance.  That could be viewed as a good thing.  I mean Gemini was lauded for compliance after all...

The smaller the network the faster the transactions due to constraints of the speed of light.  If the network is distributed over 5000 sq.

You should hold both, more btc obviously as the gains could be unreal, but a good precious metal hedge is smart.  Many previous metal folks have bought btc, because of the discount afforded by pm dealers when using btc.  They are less an enemy tg an two years ago.

They are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  They are more or less a speculative/gambling instrument.  Like it or not, bitcoin has very few ways to be used and trading alts is a relatively fun way to pass the years.
You may note that altcoin market valutions are higher than today before the run in November 2014.  
And when the next huge adoption occurs, ehat are folks going to do with them.  It is either spend them on goodsls, look at them, or give trading alts a try.  This is pushed by btc gains giving a sense of wealth and seeing rising alt prices.  It is a feedback loop.  The gains seen last run in alts was jaw dropping.

Why?  Alts are a derivative play.  I you buy a $1000 in btc and buy Alts and they dbl in value, that is great.  At the time of selling, you have concurrently realized 25% bitcoin gains, you end up with $2500.  
It is a dynamic marketplace and that is why it is growing at an alarming rate.  It is always about the btc and it is a huge game of musical chairs, but the bull market has has legs.

New exchange and a lot of new users to process, I reckon.  One of those things you don't think of until after the fact.  Probably should have used coinbase, but this is only an issue because of rising price.  If it had fallen, you would be thankful but not post.  Just one of those things that happen.  In 3 weeks you won't even remembers you will have sent all your btc to cryptsy to buy cloak and have 3x the btc's that you bought.    Then you think you are big s*** and start to shirk work responsibilies and mouth off to your superiors, because they are not superior to you, they don't even get btc.  Idiots.  You lose your job, but btc is $1560 per and you have almost forty, who cares, its only one prostitute.  No job and coke riddled you pass away 7.92 million dollars in btc, but it is in a wallet no one knows the password to.  You have no family, no legitimate children no real legacy at all.  Was this whole btc thing worth it?

With all due respect, your statement infantile and you are a gaywad.  
If ETH had anywhere near the true value and attention of btc the same issues would arise.  The true and right answer would be to hold a core position on btc and smaller positions of Altcoins as fliers, because they are way more risky. ETH has very little benefit beyond bitcoin and that benefit appears to be held to a dns  type system and/or a decentralized casino.  They have value.  But let's not over well it as being even remotely close to btc.

Have been think will see 500 to 600 USD by the end of year, but momentum could carry much higher.  You will likely see the USD income tax return demand push being exacerbated by the subsidy halving, but you need truly viable use cases to sustain price levels.  I personally rent see $1200 until 2017 or 2018, but once the mainstream adoption begins, you will not reference btc as a whole unless your an investor.  Most people will be send bits or thinking in fiat terms when using.

Pointless.  A provider a ecosystem does not make.  They have no reason to accept BTC.  They have a customer base that is massive while BTC user number ~5 million world wide.  They will come back when it makes sense.
