Im... just gonna call BS based on the title..
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:33:45
Could it be... Could *I* be? Maybe.. Just maybe, I'm responsible for my own actions?
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:42:57
Hah Yea at the time I learned about SR, I was too lazy to look into acquiring BTC and just forgot about it. I would have kicked myself if I'd gotten like an ounce of weed then the price more than quadrupled, so I'm kinda glad I didnt. HOWEVER I totally overlooked Bitcoins potential and promptly forgot about it until the first age of HOLY SHIT $900
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:22:10
I can't see how anyone could say this is a bad thing... I didn't see anything saying one was opening in Seattle, which would have made my day

Exchanges come and go, but the blockchain is forever.

Not like I do a bunch of drugs, just pointing it out.

Man if I deserve death then the world deserves another giant meteor.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:15:24
Right? 700,000 BTC, then 800,000, now 1.75 mill?
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:28:44
"While you play the game, mine Bitcoin" Lol please elaborate
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:07:20
Why would it
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:13:48
Brilliant business plan, make a video game... pay people to play it
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:01:04
Also, Wizards.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:14:48
I have no fuckin idea what you're talking about...
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:09:41
9 Hours later and I realize I should clarify. I do NOT want mainstream BTC banks. That's a bad road to go down, kinda beats the purpose of BTC.
I'm just young and broke and have dealt with many a late fee from *cough* BoA
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:27:58
Something, Something all the way to the bank
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:51:48
And does the system account for BTC that is either misplaced/destroyed? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:38:13
That's some solid advise, thankyou. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:55:09
I said 100%...
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:48:04
See, that is just fantastic. I always knew banks were screwing me, but I never had perspective on how bad it was. Ever since I've gotten into BTC it's like "Holy shit, why do people put up with this" Soon, maybe, we won't have to
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:42:48
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:29:10
Well, I'll receive them on friday morning based on whatever the market value is at the time, hopefully it dips down a touch but with so many people pending transactions who knows how it will go down 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:33:33
What was Wow Gold? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:33:38
Mmm, it spreads like warm margarine 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:14:51
This shit ain't even close to over
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:45:54
Damn, maybe something like this would entice people to.. Ehem.. *Tip*
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:26:32
Spread the love homie!

[Never go full retard..](
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:50:33
There's this too. My parents give me the equivalent of a pat on the head and a "that's nice, sweetie" when I tell them i'm up a lot in a short time and that they should look into it. screw em, they will learn when it spreads and I'll say "See?" 
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:53:15
To you and the twelve other people who posted this morons rantings to this subreddit: Stop it. We know Krugman doesn't know wtf he is talking about.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:55:42
Interesting, thanks. Got some reading to do
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:36:23
I barely even consider that a crash, as that was right when I bought into BTC. It just took a little tumble, apply bandaid and keep on flyin
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:52:11
Climb aboard! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:21:11
Ah so far I just love the BTC community, everyone is so optimistic. Still, im nervous but hey, I didn't stake much so far
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:26:59
If everyone thinks of BTC as an investment the BTC economy will never thrive. Think of it as an exchange, hold onto some in storage and try to convert some for spending.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:46:00
I knew their arguments were invalid, just needed to know why. I DO have a lot to learn, that's why I'm not heavily invested.
Thankyou for the response
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:53:49
This was the most anticlimactic post I've ever seen
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:33:02
hah I just realized I have a cracked article open in that screenshot, it all makes sense now..
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:55:58
Fantastic, my investment is up a whole $18 gain. I wish I had gone with my gut last year... Oh well, still not too late. Can't wait for your post when it hits 10,000
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:24:10
I stop reading any article that claims btc transactions take 10 minutes..
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:51:08
But I DID chuckle

Every form of gambling ever is made for the sole purpose of fucking you.
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:11:49
Of all the retarded shit I've been sifting through in /new the past two days, this is by far the most retarded. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:37:22
This is the equivalent of logging into AOL, hoping nobody calls the LAN line, and hearing that classic static song. The process will certainly refine itself over time
