The site must be flooded with people trying to get to the checkout page, it isn't loading!

That is a good site I haven't been to before, thank you, but that's not it. Sorry, left out a detail... it tracks alt coins as well. It looks almost exactly like coinmarketcap

Here's the site I was talking about, had it bookmarked at work:

Wait, just woke up, brain foggy ATM, this is bad right?
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:07:32
Wow, not many like you, thanks! And Happy Holidays!

Wasn't too worried about it, of course I didn't have as much on the line as you! :-D

Yeah, I'm seeing the same thing. I used the bitinstant site to xfer cash from bank account to purchase BTC via the Zipmark app about an hour ago, that's just about exactly what I'm seeing

Thanks for the update, hopefully they'll reply to my email as well. Now that they know, hopefully this will be resolved soon

Guess so. I sent a support email, and they are pretty good about getting on reddit. Hope to hear something soon. Especially from the company that's slogan is "Time is money."
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:45:29
yeah, same here!  Never did hear from them, but got a transaction successful email. Now waiting on the BTC as well

She actually wanted to send me a bitcoin for real, but was unsure of the whole process, so she made this bitcoin pouch with a check inside.  Guess I didn't get the Mt. Gox rate! :-P  My wife rocks!

No idea, they are located in New York, should be within business hours now, hopefully soon!
