This sort of added liquidity into the market, while will likely be short term bad for the price of BTC, will hopefully  help improve the distribution (read lower Gini Coefficient) for the currency and ultimately reduce volatility/improve widespread use.

The answer here is that the power behind visa and master card are the banks, which are also their customers. Bitcoin "banks" would have to be established to provide real time administration of payment. But the volatility in price makes FX risk management exceedingly difficult at the moment.

For example (using easy numbers because math...)
Say for example 2usd= 1gbp
Buy 1 bitcoin via coinbase for 100 dollars
Sell 1 bitcoin via mtgox for 52gbp
Enter future fx contract that locks 2usd=1gbp
Execute future contract @ 2usd= 1gbp =$104

If that was true why would price decline? That's not a marketplace if people could only. Buy. For every buyer there is seller.
