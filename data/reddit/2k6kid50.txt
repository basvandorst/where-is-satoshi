Thank you for posting this it makes me mad to see articles say bitcoin is a "failure" because it had a big price drop. In the end it still went from a few pennies to hundreds of dollars. I disagree with those articles.

 This guy had little bitcoins with the private key on the back. You scratched it off or something. I imagine it like a chocolate coin but not chocolate. I dont remember who talked about it. It was on a post a few weeks ago.
