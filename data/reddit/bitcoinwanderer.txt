That's almost the definition of a false economy.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:21:13
Sure, but each penny it picks up costs you $1 in electricity and fixed costs......
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:57:57
So, has difficulty declined? Have people stopped mining?
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:57:49
Hahaha. I couldn't of posted a better reply!
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:07:53
No. Pure bitcoin.
Besides, I saw absolutely no gilding taking place for that awesome pure-bitcoin comment...
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:41:27
Thanks! But, what will I do with 1000 Yachts?
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:02:11
Not even every penny is worth it. You'd make more money by ignoring a penny on the street than by taking the time to pick it up.

News flash: Thinking that people with an opinion different from your own is being antagonistic and/or trolling is a sure way to determine that you, yourself, are no longer critically thinking.
Welcome to the cult of bitcoin. Please leave your brain at the door. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:04:31
That's because Bitcoin has NO FLAWS! It's divinely created and flawless. Each bitcoin will be worth $1 million, and with every transaction, you get a free blow-job from Jennifer Lawrence or similar experience with George Clooney, depending on your ~~gender~~ preference. (But, let's face it, this place is a sausage fest. Clooney will be bored to tears while Jennifer Lawrence might need her jaw repaired.)
Seriously, you need to stop spreading lies about our lord and savior, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:56:27
How about we just rename dollars to bitollars, but still continue to use the normal banking system, currency, and rules/laws. That'll fix everything!
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:55:58
I'm no socialist. But, I do think a "currency" that was created to enrich the persons who were early adopters, and maintain their lead through technological means, isn't sustainable. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:49:20
I know.. I'll buy just 100 yachts, then use the rest of the money to pay the poor plebs who haven't heard about the good-news of Bitcoin to operate them!
That, and a few cars, houses, and guns. Lots of guns.
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:57:02
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:21:57
Trolls? Can I buy those too?
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:06:00
So, I should be buying $20 bills for $50 for the "experience"?
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:36:27
Next time, don't get goxse'd!
Also, the gold rush caused financial ruin too. And tulips. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:39:29
Is it only $1000 now?
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:15:04
Thanks for the gold! But, the 0.05071309BTC you spent on me will be worth roughly $5.07 million in about 4.8 years.
Wonder if reddit will refund the difference?
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:23:01
Suicides? This is the first I've heard about this.. Is there actually confirmation in regards to that?
Out of curiosity, I wonder about the culpability of the mods on since they were actively removing posts about suicide prevention. Seems to me that that might have been extreme indifference...
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:00:16
I have no idea what you're talking about! I see no trolls, down vote recipients or dissenters. All I see are posts about how awesome Bitcoin is, and how everyone is having an orgy-fest as they buy porches and houses with their ~~winnings~~ earnings.
Obviously, you are making stuff up and are intending to introduce something more than just simply cultism into this subreddit. For shame, Sir. For shame.
@_date: 2014-06-22 02:29:35
Yay Bitcoin! Making it possible to extort people without even needing to collect unmarked bills.

I can't wait to buy my Yacht with the few satoshi's I've gotten from the coin faucets!
@_date: 2014-03-14 06:41:56
I'll create a GUI interface using Visual Basic to track their IP address.
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:40:38
I like the way you think.
Now, where to find a rich woman to marry?
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:03:54
Puhleeze.... A $2500 ASIC doesn't make $2500 worth of bitcoins....
Tell me how anyone can possibly make money with an ASIC?
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:12:54
Pshaw, I don't need no job! I'm just going to make millions on BTC!
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:12:23
Could I just get a few coins from the free coin faucets? Will BTC appreciate enough from a few Satoshi's?
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:59:02
Those people become disenfranchised.. They drop bitcoin. Bitcoin constantly needs new blood... Eventually, you'll run out of new blood to buy into bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:35:30
This groupthink is how cults work.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:07:39
During the California gold rush, lots of people panned for gold too. So, because a few make money, that's why bitcoin will be ok?
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:38:23
Nope. Not me. I found 750,000 coins. Wait, isn't that about what mtgox lost?????
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:10:03
Oh, that makes it way better.. Corporations own 30% of bitcoin. Phew. I was worried for a moment...
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:35:08
My wife likes tulips, and we need to redo our garden. Problem?
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:21:29
I trade a lot of AAPL. On a LOW VOLUME day, AAPL has over $4 BILLION worth of trades. On a high volume day, AAPL does more trades than Bitcoin has done -- ever.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:23:31
Downvotes.. LOL.. just HATES when people point out that the emperor has no clothes!
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:26:33
So did Tulips in 1637 when a single bulb sold for more than the annual income of a skilled tradesman... And, your point?
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:13:42
Bigger news: Giving me 250 bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:17:44
Lack of liquidity is due to the low volumes places like MtGox does. Selling even 100BTC would be 0.5% of the TOTAL TRANSACTIONS for the day! That's insane.
A LARGE trading day is about $20 million USD. Most days it's WAY less.
I can see $20million traded in TSLA or AAPL within the first few minutes of the exchange opening.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:42:33
Hahahaha. Markets don't work like that. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:22:50
AAPL does that in a single day -- on a LOW volume day. I bet you can't sell $50,000 worth of BTC even 50-times as fast as I can sell $50,000 worth of AAPL.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:43:37
Bitcoin, according to you, transacts 80% of it's total market cap in a year.
AAPL transacts on average (3mo avg) $6B per day. So, roughly $1.5TRILLION per year (actually, it's more, but, don't want to make bitcoin feel too bad). So, that's uh, lets see.. 250% of it's value? Or, three times more than bitcoin..
But, remember.. That's just ONE stock that's for sale on the open market. Bitcoin isn't even a rounding error on the NASDAQ or NYSE.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:47:44
Right, we should compare BTC to something less tangible; like bubbles.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:46:18
Don't get me wrong.. I like the theory behind BTC; I just think BTC is about as inherently useful as an [icebox]( Sure, it might work, but, it's not what people use.
