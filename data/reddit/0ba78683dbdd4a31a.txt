1. They totally can, it's just trickier from a legal perspective to leave a company with your buddies and setup a competitor
2. If we look at how Bitcoin forks have gone historically, do you really think it's that easy?
3. A fork is just one thing that makes the investment risky. Do you really think we as Bitcoin investors right now who are investing based on reliable past performance are taking more risk than people who invested in Facebook before it went public and therefore before reliable records of its value existed?

How is it any different from regular investment? Chart the growth of a company before it goes public (Facebook, for example) and compare it to the growth of Bitcoin — you may have a different perspective on the word "bubble". Is the risk taken by an early investor in Facebook any different from that of anyone here?

Also a great way to store value in something with low volatility. The real trick would be buying CGT-free bullion with bitcoin directly as a store of value then selling it off as required.

Sure, you need money to afford whatever fines they throw at you, but it means you're not personally liable, which is the whole point. They don't hit _you_ with the fine, they hit the _corporation_, you may walk away just fine even if the corporation crashes and burns but without it you'd be declaring bankruptcy.

Totally, and even simple operations become troublesome, like trying to sell a non-trivial amounts vs capital gains tax. I expect unwieldy legislation fairly soon so the whole becoming-a-stable-and-usable-currency possible future is a very attractive one!

Sure, all you have to do is:
1. Incorporate in the USA
2. Make loads of money through that corporation
3. Do all your illegal stuff through the corporation
4. Profit

Everyone must come to terms with what they are capable of eventually.
I have a sizeable investment in Bitcoin — not enough to buy the world but enough to be terrified about UK Capital Gains Tax. A few weeks ago I asked myself how I could minimise my liability, perhaps by reinvesting elsewhere, buying land or gold, etc.
Then I realised that this is how the rich think; whenever you hear of someone getting their wrists slapped for having dodgy accounts in the Cayman Islands or some such, this is what they were thinking: protect what is mine.
It's always different when it's you.

I see what you mean, you're right that we've got to be careful to avoid the temptation of views at the extreme end of the scale however there's definitely a lot of misinformation out there — tulip comparisons or arguments regarding fast growth, for example.
The reason I posted this is because in a series of relatively neutral news summaries there was a single statement about bitcoin that most people will read and interpret as justification for not having involved themselves in bitcoin.
As for regulation, I'd be very surprised if we didn't start to see it in the near future given the size of the potential tax revenue.

At the time of posting, the news reel was ~20 pieces of around 2 minutes each with one about bitcoin in the middle that just said "Bitcoin fever exposes crypto-market frailties" then moved to the next one.


Not sure where you're getting this from...

This was on Reuters.tv which summarises news into short stories between 1-3 minutes and this was the only one in the list anywhere near as short — it was the only one without any actual content, it was just a headline!
Ironically, I added Reuters to my news sources to be more impartial and yet they post this sort of FUD that adds no value to the subject whatsoever and just scares people.
So what do we do, guys?
Edit: They have since added an actual report here which is less fearmonger-ey.

I see what you mean, you're right that it's nothing to be proud of, aside from tax avoidance as an academic exercise.
The scary part is how easy it is to condemn tax avoidance on the grounds you mentioned yet how difficult it is to part with money you feel you deserve.

Media sources try to position themselves as reliable sources of investment information while simultaneously encouraging people to buy high and sell low, it's bonkers.

Cards represent the requisite infrastructure on which poker is played. You could also play rummy, solitaire, snap, etc. but they're all built on top of cards which makes them the thing with potential for other uses, like blockchain.
That said, I see your point that the cards are the instantiation of the game's format but firstly, playing cards have more potential than the singular game of poker and secondly, it's possible to overthink these things :)

Not quite, you pay tax when your gains and/or losses are realised, so if bitcoin were acknowledged as a currency you'd pay tax on the gains in the same way you pay it for interest on your savings but because it's an asset the tax isn't owed until the gains are realised.
That's why property, gold, watches, etc. are great places to hide wealth.

I gave up on coinbase a long time ago. They stopped accepting GBP deposits so max is £100 on a card (or euros incurring heavy fees), support is basically non-existent and people far for knowledgeable about bitcoin left it a long time ago.
My current setup is localbitcoins for buying/selling and an electrum wallet. 5% extra effort, 100% better security, 200% less mucking about and panicking when CB goes down...
