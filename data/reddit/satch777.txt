Because it's stupid.  Next question.

Fiat currency is a medium of non-intrinsic value that is representative of intrinsic value by a decree from an authoritative body.  Either from a government or from a large number of delusional libertarian neckbeards.

If you took this to court, you would lose and go bankrupt defending your supposed "right" to not accept US currency in the United States.
Sounds like a well thought out plan.
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:43:44
And the character is just as real as the currency!  Perfect!

The analogy to the internet is accurate.  Bitcoin is like Gopher.  Attractive to relatively few users based on it's limited usefulness, it will fade away and be forgotten in favor of a superior alternative.
Tl;dr... Bitcoin is dead.

Even Batman gets tired of the relentless Bitcoin proselytizing....
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:41:50
Call it "pseudo-money".  It's more accurate.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:16:14
Most of bitcoin can only be explained like you're five....  "I made up some new money, and all my friends have promised to use it.  My new Disney Dollars are real money!  Everyone who has them says so!  Tell your friends to use them too!  If Jimmy says his Star Wars bucks are worth more, we're not playing with him anymore."
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:11:50
If this is true.... it's pathetic.
If it's simply hyperbole to express your love of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general... it's still pathetic.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:25:50
No...  It will be more like "hey... I remember Bitcoin!   You still need to pay for that bagel, though."
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:59:17
Sweet...  When bitcoin is gone and almost forgotten in a few years, it will be nice to have some remembrance on display.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:21:58
And then they all died.  Appropriate.
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:11:05
You apparently don't know the definition of "fiat".
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:36:57
HA HA HA HA HA.....  no.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:58:04
But....but...  bitcoin is perfect, isn't it?
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:28:57
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:22:27
Haven't had one, because bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:50:42
Bitcoin is fiat.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:13:41
Don't get so upset, Sparky...  No one's taking away your Disney Dollars.  We're just having fun here.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:34:18
The 1.21 Gigawatt time machine I used to go forward in time five years and see btc having faded away into obscurity disagrees with you, wanker
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:11:45
No, I won't.  I cashed out my btc and made a nice profit from this fad while it lasts.
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:58:02
Except that will never happen now because it's bitcoin.  And bitcoin is dead as disco.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:51:13
YOU HAVE RUINED MY CAREER.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:00:09
Then, it all comes crumbling down and bitcoiners cry and cry and cry....
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:37:16
Just take $100 from each paycheck and donate it to a homeless shelter.  At least you'll have the satisfaction of helping your fellow man, instead of having nothing but the regret you'll feel at the act of taking so much money and wasting it on a foolish fad.
@_date: 2014-02-10 02:23:26
"When bitcoin overtakes fiat currency...."  lololololol 
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:37:36
Perhaps less fiat than mass delusion, but it falls in the same category.
