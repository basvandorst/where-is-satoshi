yes, and what do you think their strategy for getting it to go down was again? say china ban bitcoin.

nah son. we've been talking about the value of bitcoin since 2011. it's time to talk about the price.

I can't seem to find any info on CVE-2018-17144
can you please provide information about what this is?
@_date: 2015-12-13 23:59:23
I doubt the failure you saw on those drives was related to nand expiring and not the controller
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:39:27
so what?
if they are forced to pay 8x/20x the amount of fees to fill one block, spamming just became more expensive. considering all you have to do is pay a higher transaction fee than the majority of the spam transactions, I don't think it will be that hard to get your legitimate transactions through.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:10:04
there is nothing in any of those ideas that is going to prevent someone from filling any block size if they really want to. sidechain? the spammer won't use it. optimizations? they'll work around it. the only thing keeping your transaction going through first is going to be the fee.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:32:15
raise the block size on the software end of things.
as for the user end of things, pay a higher fee than the spammers if you want your transaction to be first. eventually the spammers will either spend too much and run out of money for stupid things like this, or they will spend too little and their transactions will just be backlogged.
I've never been made clear exactly what the "fee" is used for. it should be clear in the software clients that the fee is what gives your transaction priority over other ones.
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:49:53


they'd better hurry then. looks like they released software that is actively being used in the real world, and the people using the software are doing nothing wrong. if using the software breaks the software, it needs to be fixed, fast.
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:39:59
just keep sending coins back and forth and don't pay a fee
@_date: 2014-05-20 02:34:51
shut the fuck up
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:48:10
I've never had a transaction not go through with zero fee
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:08:14
it's obvious you've never tried this. you will get your money back if you tried a chargeback with any credit card.
@_date: 2014-01-03 09:57:43
I have bought one flight with cheapair. the other time I used my CC because I felt the price of bitcoins wasn't high enough at the time.
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:51:13


yes they do. they would absolutely got out of business if they didn't accept CC.


eventually there will just be a bitcoin CC and that will be it.
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:18:44
so do I. and I guarantee you they'll take CC before bitcoins. drop your argument. everyone takes CC before bitcoins.
if they won't even take CC, they will not take bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:07:34
they can return the money then
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:37:37


for this situation it largely is. I doubt someone would be able to attack the network inbetween but can't modify the server itself.
@_date: 2014-08-06 05:04:04
that's how some do. you can easily have execution caps. why should you not be able to max yours if that's what they can do.

@_date: 2014-05-16 08:56:12
because the guy has no clue what bitcoin is and that is the standard way to report a file that is broken
the sad part is he's not the stupid one, you are, for not being able to figure out why he would be confused
@_date: 2014-05-21 11:09:13


so then he shouldn't have won his case. you're back to supporting the scammer in this scenario.
you can't have it both ways.
either local bitcoins gives out the info to no one, in which case OP loses his case, or they give it out to some people, and which case OP wins his case.
so which would you rather have? op wins? op loses? you don't get to pick both.

@_date: 2014-02-17 17:24:44
any site associated with metart accepts bitcoin
 visit there to get a gauge of it
none of those links will work so google to get to the individual site, but any of those accept btc
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:35:20


not really. they would easily fall below profits and into the negative if they couldn't handle as something simple as a CC. bitcoins may help, but it will never be necessary.
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:52:06
you work for manwin
either way, look at coinbase or bitpay and use them to accept coins. they convert it to cash instantly and direct deposit it to you. that's all there is to it.
@_date: 2014-01-03 10:03:01
except they need to accept CC, they don't need to accept bitcoin

@_date: 2014-05-21 09:34:04
so you support the OP losing his case?
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:07:10


nope. I guarantee you at&amp;t has a terms of service clause saying that they are not responsible for downtime.
so if you take tos to mean anything, nobody can ever chargeback.

he had his case go to appeal and he won. that's all the looking up you need to do.
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:03:40


we did a 50/50 split at one time, and the half we kept of bitcoins was worth much much more in the end
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:06:03
why? what could possibly happen that could negatively affect them? they are just storing money in the account, if someone asks for more money than they have, bounce it.
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:25:23
the whole point of bitcoin is that we don't have to pay anyone to send money. they are getting their portion of the 25 block. the idea that we have fees right now is stupid.
@_date: 2019-03-05 02:58:18
no court on this planet is going to demand that you get a bar of gold. you will definitely be forced to accept dollars.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:18:47
yawn. what has honestly changed about bitcoin's tech in the last 7 years? aside from optimizations it's the same piece of software it's always been. you send coins from A to B. what do you even want us to talk about?

if the site uses https this is not possible unless you accepted a root ssl certificate from the wifi. doubtful this is what did it.
@_date: 2018-07-22 04:07:25
you are not guaranteed to "grow" that money. you could actually end up losing lots of it in the short term. and maybe even the long term depending on if you actually needed it to pay off the car and now you have to sell at a loss. you will definitely lose 2% though.
quoting the 8% average annual return for lifetime will make you sound stupid, so don't do that. you are not saving or making money by taking out loans. if that were the case, why don't you go down to the bank and get a massive loan at 2% and "grow that money" on all of your assets.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:50:29


couldn't you have just waited 2 months and bought it yourself? what's the fucking point
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:34:55
yes, definitely make sure you pay interest for no reason
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:33:52
they said no when I asked and bought mine

if you can get this page  to be back to page one on google, I will pay you. or whoever else can. the term I want back is "auto clicker"

I did

do not listen to bitcoinfan. he is retarded.
@_date: 2011-05-26 05:08:33


the difficulty would just adjust and prevent them from mining the rest of the coins. no matter how much computational power you have, you can never mine the rest of the coins.
@_date: 2011-05-04 04:27:07
that's ridiculously overpriced. he's taking like an $8 cut on $50 card
@_date: 2011-06-21 22:33:28
as if it would be that hard to just look around?
@_date: 2011-05-24 07:53:36

@_date: 2018-07-22 22:07:37
I had "auto clicker" for years and somehow lost it. I don't care if it takes 3 months, I just need it to happen. the other terms are useless.
@_date: 2011-04-18 04:14:16
yes. it is 100% worth joining a pool. everyone is in a pool no matter how high their hash rate.
@_date: 2011-05-27 01:19:13
umm okay bro. I made thousands of dollars on just a 5870 and 5970, so yeah, good job.
@_date: 2011-06-09 06:04:22


for me it does. I spend my coins all of the time, sometimes I'm waiting on an instant payout from deep to complete a transaction
@_date: 2011-06-08 21:27:32
first off bitcoinpool is NOT transparent. they have a thread on bitcoin.org where they would purposely censor the discussion so jgarzik made an uncensored one.
second, 106ghash, good luck getting steady payouts like I do on deep.
