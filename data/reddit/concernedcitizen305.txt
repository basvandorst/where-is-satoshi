As soon as you're asked where your money came from or went to and you can't actually answer that question you're in some deep shit.
An exchange handles the KYC as an intermediary. Wiring or receiving large sums of money to/from complete strangers? Good luck explaining that. Bisq is literally the worst way to buy and sell crypto. The paper trail points to you even if it's legitimate.

Use this exchange if you want to get yourself into trouble.

If it's $10 fine. What if it's $5000? And they will ask for evidence. The fact that bisq says don't mention anything about crypto in the wire instructions just makes it worse.
Bisq looks like it was designed by money launderers to screw retail investors. I can't believe how much it's been shilled. It's dangerous.

Gold is being used less and less, not more. Have you ever tried selling gold? It's always a sketchy uncomfortable process at some usually run down dealer.

Bitcoin is the only investment I've never worried about. It can't go bankrupt.
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:19:03
I'm saying it's a lot easier to buy and sell crypto at an exchange.
Gold is to BlockBuster as Bitcoin is to Netflix.

$8.88 is a lot for a book that's just over 100 pages. The choice of "lucky" 888 doesn't sit well with me either. It screams buy this book because the price is lucky which is stupid.
If you were writing this book to educate people price it accordingly, not for a heft profit margin. This is not the first simple Bitcoin book.
I won't be buying this book at this price.

Hey if you're comfortable with the risk. As long as you know.

I don't think you're following me. If that person is a criminal you're complicit. You will be linked directly. With a normal exchange they take care of KYC. With bisq there is "no KYC" but legally it becomes your responsibility.
@_date: 2019-10-11 20:53:27
Consider the following:
You sell BTC to anonymous and they wire 10k to your account using bisq. 
IRS knocks. 
Try explaining it.

That 7500% number in the article is missing at least another zero or two.. Hal had Bitcoin well before $133.

Great exchange if you want to be criminally prosecuted for sending and receiving money directly to/from complete strangers who are probably laundering money. 
Bisq is a sure fired way to screw yourself if someone ever asks questions.

They don't make any money.

Yea no credibility after that one. Only shitcoiners use and support binance.

This always puzzles me. December 2013 bitcoin was all over the mainstream media. When it cracked $1000 it was on ever news channel.

Honestly you're giving them way too much credit. Circa 2013 sure alts were all about different encryption scheme and emission rates (POS, POW, etc). After-ETH alts are almost all scams.

The only demand it ever had was to fund ICOs. Nobody wants to fund ICOs anymore.

Scam. Downvoted this.
