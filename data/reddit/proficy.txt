I don’t think bitcoin will ever serve for day to day transactions.
Bitcoin is like your savings account, the measure in which you express wealth.
The currency your house is valued in.
You wanna go buy a loaf of bread?
Use the dollar.
You want to pay rent?
Buy a car?
Get a pay check?
Use bitcoin.

We know Bitcoin still has hurdles to take and loops to jump through, but most people here are convinced those will be taken.

The problem with Bitcoin and Gold for WB is that they don’t pay interest or dividends.
I’ve also broken my head how interests work if you have a deflationary currency like Bitcoin which you can’t print but you can lose never to recover.
If I give you a 0.1 BTC loan, I am going to charge you interests. With a diminishing supply, where are those extra satoshis you are going to pay me come from? 
You’ll probably see an economy where BTC is used as collateral to be able to get a loan and the actual interests are coming from other money tokens the lender values.

Other coins will also be used, but on a utility basis.
Your base wealth will be satoshis, your interest, your groceries, your paycheck will be paid in some different currency.
If you will want to buy something meaningful, you’ll have to pay in Bitcoin, or better said, you’ll have to get a bitcoin loan, to settle with the entity you are buying from, the interest payments will be in whatever the bitcoin lender accepts.

If nobody ever spends Bitcoin its value should be below zero since the environmental cost is so damn high.
Bitcoin 4000$ is actually bitcoin -1000$ since it costs more to mine it than 4000$.
So, if you don’t spend it, you are not going to create demand, and if you don’t create demand, might as well stop mining it.

Thanks, I enjoy this thought exercise.
The way you see things, I see value for Bitcoin holders as a collateral for whatever credit they want to acquire.
Say you have 5 BTC to your name and you want to start a business or any sort of project, so the person funding your business can now use your 5BTC as collateral, and create a contract that in the case you fail to turn a profit the BTC will (partly) change ownership.

At least the hot potato is used and accepted.
Currency is acceptance.
Bitcoin today is not currency, it’s a commodity, and a commodity with no use case outside of investing at that.
That’s quite unique in the economic world.
Since every metal that I know of has some sort of industrial use case.
So we have bitcoin as an investment commodity, one that doesn’t pay dividends, doesn’t pay interests and who’s value is solely determined by the buyer and the seller.
Begs the question, if no one uses it as a currency, how attractive is this commodity for an investor.

Not even government agencies spend their resources on calling people to perform actions that don’t net them income.

Yeah maybe but to what end? If you go long you want people long with you I guess. Anyway I see a higher low on the MACD in terms of the February low, and a divergence between price going down and MACD going up for last two lows. RSI is in the 30’s, so either we are up for a serious rebound or we have a bottom here.

If you want to be sure, ask your father to ask it to his legal department and get it in writing.
But anyhow, you’re 13, plenty of time to learn trading, why not start with stocks or FX.

The invoice is a requirement by the United States so that it can apply taxes and account for them.
If the company follows United States rules, it must do it all the way.
Bitpay is a company.
Bitcoin is a currency.
You can pay Bitcoin OTC to someone who doesn’t send you an invoice.
If someone sets up an eBay-System with bitcoin payments. You got what you ask for.

1) most alts are priced in the only pair available for them ALT/BTC the dollar value is just a derivative.
2) when big sell orders for bitcoin come rolling in, liquidity in Alts tends to dry up so seller and buyers in alts meet  at a lower price.
3) traders sell alts in order to fund bitcoin positions.

that depends if you believe the 20 million BTC which are actually tradeable and not lost/locked should only represent a 20 billion value, given that the world population is 8 billion and q guy like Bill Gates on his lonesome is worth 90 billion.

Bitcoin on coinbase is not your Bitcoin it’s Coinbase’s bitcoin until you take it out.
You probably transferred Coinbase Bitcoin  to a wallet that is flagged as criminal.
Or you received bitcoin from a criminal wallet.
If no activity happened with this Coinbase account, then it’s all question marks.
First of all: don’t leave coins on an Exchange if you want it to be yours.
Secondly: when they give you chance to rectify your error, do it and take out their bitcoin and put it into your own wallet.

There’s only 15 million bitcoin, there’s more than 15 million millionaires in this world and I’m sure at one point they’ll all want at least one bitcoin.

- Option A)
You believe that in the long run at least 21 million people in the world will want to pay 100.000$ for 1 Bitcoin.
Maybe even 1.000.000$
- Option B)
You believe Bitcoin is worthless.
You sir are an option A kind of person, and personally I believe option B kind of persons who think an asset which has overcome 10years of existing against all odds will go to be worthless are the insane ones.
8000$ for an asset with no expiry date, and which can be used anywhere with an internet connection, with an inventory as limited as 21 million and an availability of maybe 15 million pieces, is pretty damn cheap to me.
