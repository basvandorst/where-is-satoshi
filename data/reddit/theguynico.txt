More sellers than buyers = price drop and the other way around.

Non US person here too, was having the same issues with most of the top recommended sites like coinbase and others. I even have a US bank account and still had issues because of no SSN number. And even the one's who allow non us persons verification is a pain in the ass because our national IDs don't have an expiration date. 
The only work around I found was to download Electeum wallet and buy coins on localbitcoins dot com
BTW if and wallet provider read this if you're going to allow non us peoples to sign up please read up on how gov issued I'd works in other countries. Most sites I go to already know my country does not have an exp date on our national ID s as soon as I select the country. It will make the process a lot better and bitcoin more main stream. 
Sorry to the OP for the small rant but it took me 2 full days to buy bitcoin and was not fun at all.

I could see this happening a lot in South America and glad to see its not that wide spread. Idk about Ecuador banking but in Colombia banks make huge profits in fees. For example if I deposit $100 at my local bank they will change as much as a $10 fee so now my deposit only shows a balance of $90 then if I want to make a withdraw they can charge another $10. They stared this practice when banks were in trouble and needed a bailout so to say but even after we had a lot of growth and our stock exchange went up over 50% they still charge those fees.

i think we forgot to tell everyone about how insider trading is still allowed here, or at least it was about 5 or 6 years ago.

Dear Americans, Please do everything you can to stop this, if this bill passes in your country other governments will copy this law. Do you remember the silly laws about public breast feeding? Well in my country no one cared about that until a bill was introduced in the US. I was wondering how long it would take from them to make such a stupid law.
