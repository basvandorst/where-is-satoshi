Since it's fundamental to the concept, and pretty much the way everything in the real of computing/electronics power has gone, ever, yes I do.


Where did I say this is what he intended? Maybe you should read and try to understand luke-jr's reply.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:12:02


Sorry for being able to show you what you wrote.


And as luke-jn points out, long term this won't go away. Since you claim to know all this, why are you at all interested in Bitcoin if you think it's bad?
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:57:01
Yes, any changes to bitcoin to will be short lived in terms of preventing ASIC mining.

Given the nature of the design I think it's safe to assume that the creator understood that through the history of computers/electronics hardware has been created to solve particular problems in ways that 'current' tech doesn't. I think the designer(s?) of bitcoin understood that this was inevitable, they're obviously not stupid.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:17:34


Nobody made that claim. What are you proposals, how are you adding to the discussion apart from saying one thing then contradicting yourself later?
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:32:35


Why do you think this when all of computing &amp; electrical engineering proves otherwise?
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:33:13
A quick skim and I see theymos says he did not anticipate ASIC. I see no quote of Satoshi. Later theymos states:
At 18 he sounded inexperienced and naive, fairly typical of an 18 year old. Nothing you have claimed here invalidates the argument I made that the obvious ASIC inevitability was known to anyone with reasonable exposure to anything in the field, or even those who could take an educated guess. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:16:09


Why do you assume this?
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:07:20
You said


then 


which is it? whichever suits your argument? First you say you don't think he could or would have expected it, then go on to say he was aware of it?
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:58:27


So again, not the person who designed bitcoin. Nothing you have raised invalidates what I said in any way. Everything you have posted is an assumption, from an at the time inexperienced 18 year old. You must be incredibly naive. Most bitcoiners had no concept of ASIC before they got into bit
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:03:25


Again, you're saying that I said things which I did not. I simply sated that given the history of computing/electronics they would have been aware of the direction in which this headed. Which isn't saying "If you say that you expected Satoshi to have thought of everything". Did you read the link luke-jr supplied?
@_date: 2017-04-23 07:50:41




Talk about totally missing the point. How do you think the market price grows?
@_date: 2017-04-22 08:38:51
Awesome, let's just change the price in their ordering URL from:
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:41:07
Yes, you're making baseless assumptions, based on someone else you don't know, having worked with someone they likely never met face to face when them where young and 'naive'. Given that there is no CPU only Proof of work, and that adults working anywhere close to the computing or science sectors had demonstrable, irrefutable evidence that time and time again specific hardware always arises to meet requirements, especially where there is money to be made.
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:48:15
No I didn't.
I said they should spent the BTC on what they were going to use fiat for, then instantly use the fiat they were going to spend to buy more BTC. The amount they'd beholding would be the same. I suggested buying a % more back, which would mean increasing. This does the BTC economy more good than holding, not creating churn and replenishing your "savings".
If you claim to want BTC to grow, simply holding isn't growing anything, churn, adoption, the price. There's no evidence for this.
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:21:15
elsewhere you said:


Then make logos or teach people to design them in exchange for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:19:20
where as using it, repurchasing BTC (maybe plus a percentage) means you're not out of pocket (since you'd be spending fiat anyway) and you help to grow the economy, increasing the value.
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:11:16


run linux


PC mining died many years ago.


Good luck with that. Why not exchange goods or services for BTC if you want one so much
@_date: 2017-04-23 07:39:00
That isn't what I said.
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:34:43


They sold for a few cents (US) at one point. If you CPU mined you likely spent more on electricity than you earned.

@_date: 2017-04-22 15:16:59
So you have asset X.
You use some of asset X to buy a product and service you need, then buy some more asset X with cash, replacing what you would have spent anyway. As consequence your help to grow the value of asset X, meaning what you have is worth more and you haven't spent anything in addition. How is this not in your interests?
@_date: 2017-04-22 10:54:46
No it isn't. Holding onto something is literally never doing anything with it. You have it, you don't use it. You behaviour is illogical and does not benefit your goal of reaping the rewards of something with more use and churn. 
Use BTC to buy things, buy back (+ a percentage) of BTC what you spent.
@_date: 2017-04-22 10:21:07
in order to grow the economy people actually have to use it. Use BTC to buy things, then buy back the amount you spent in fiat.

Thanks for the info, but I want one store that can deal with bitcoin as well as other payment types. My hope is to let users see that the fees and therefor the price they pay for something is less with bitcoin, compared to other methods.

If  you have free (or near free) electricity and a great many of the top of the line miners, the cost or the equipment and running it will likely never be recouped.
