Not so long ago, THB and BTC were at parity.

We crossed the "most people on the planet will never be able to own one full bitcoin" threshold when the human population crossed 10.5 million.

I was trying to illustrate that it doesn't necessarily take 10x as much money to raise the price from 700-&gt;7000 as it took to raise it from 7-&gt;700...

*But, it is end of 2017 now... and Bitcoin is worth over $7000 (boy, will it be fun when it's over 9000 ;). One important distinction of going from $70 to $700... and going from $700 to $7000 is that you need to pump in 10 TIMES as much $. We saw more than 100 BILLION $ pumped into Bitcoin economy this year alone (compared to less than 10 billion in 7 years combined).*
This isn't how a market works--To go from $70 to $700, only a few coins have to change hands.  Similar from $700 to $7000. You don't need to put in "ten times the money"...  
Imagine I make sweaters, and sell them for 1 dollar each.  I sell 100 of them ($100 spent on sweaters).  Now Beyonce wears one of the sweaters, and suddenly they're hot.  One person buys one of the old ones for $1000 and there are lots of other buyers, and suddenly people will only sell their sweaters if they get $1000.
Only $1000 was injected, but did the market value of all the sweaters combined jump from $100 to $100,000...
This is why the current situation is so scary. The "market cap" of bitcoin is $120 billion, but there's nowhere near $120 billion that's been spent on bitcoin.  BTC is at an all time high.  You know what that means? Every single person who holds bitcoins today has unrealized paper profits. Every single one. They've all paid less for their stash.  Some paid $1/btc. Some mined hundreds a day in 2009. Some sucked them out of a faucet.  Some paid $3, $432, $1100, $2500, $6800.  They've *all* made a "profit."  But to think that $120 billion has been sunk into bitcoin is folly. If people try to cash out, the price in USD will fall off a precipice. Almost none of the whales holding bitcoin at it's current price would be either willing or able to buy their current holdings at the current price if it weren't for their paper profits in...bitcoin! Not the Winklevosses, that's for sure.
To convert their BTC to USD, the WInklevosses would have to find buyers for a billion dollars worth of bitcoin. Satoshi would have to find $23 billion somewhere waiting in the wings.
That money is not there. You'll find someone waiving $7400 for your bitcoin.  But not for everyone on coinbase or bitcointalk or maybe even on reddit will.
Some of us will be able to realize our gains, and pay for Christmas, or a Panamera, or a mortgage.  But not *all* of us will. The money isn't there.  How much do you think has been spent on Bitcoin ? Not the volume, but total.  How much money is "in" each bitcoin ? I'd guess less than $500.

Well, it all took more or less the same effort to mine out of the ground, and an ounce has held the same value as a suit over the years... so maybe the equivalent energy of $300-$600 in each ounce ?

Which coinbase numbers...lots of new users ?

"There is no way more than one person wont kill themselves over this."
Looks like you're all gonna die then, because there's no way I'm killing myself over this. I'm still in the green on my single bitcoin.
