It's already a reality, whatever the block size.  There's no guarantee when the next block will come, and there's no guarantee that the miner will include your transaction in it.  If you want instant payments, use payment channels.  These even have the advantage of being off-blockchain and still trustless!

Agreed.  A sudden doubling of block size would be a shock to the network.  Even though it would be known ahead of time (like the block subsidy halving), it still will be a sudden rise of block space supply and drop in fees.  Why not have a gradual increase over time?

So if your everything-will-be-ok argument relies on blocks growing slower than the cap, why lift the cap so high?  The max exists as a limit for what size will be considered acceptable.  Raising to 20MB right away means we accept 20MB right away.
@_date: 2015-06-09 04:16:01


Well there used to be 250,000 fully validating nodes back when bitcoin had a smaller user base.  And now the user base has grown but we're down to less than 10,000 nodes.  You could blame this on a number of things, but not least of which is the increase is the size of blocks.
So I think the signs are that we should leave it at 1MB and give decentralization some time to catch back up to where it's at a more comfortable level.
@_date: 2015-06-04 12:57:36
I understand how P2SH and multisig works.  What I'm asking is if anyone knows/has a tool which can decode the serialised script, because blockchain.info doesn't do it.

It allows you to move assets / coins between blockchains.  So, for example, you could move bitcoins to another blockchain that has different features (eg. Elements with its confidential transactions) and then later bring the coins back onto the Bitcoin blockchain.  It's different to alt-coins because there's not a floating exchange rate, it's actually a peg and the rules of the sidechains allow users to move coins back and forth by themself.

I would say no.  The fact that Mt. Gox was able to lose 10% of the monetary supply ($400M), and yet this did not kill Bitcoin, leads me to believe that the system is very robust, so even if we have catastrophic capacity issues that cause the blockchain to be almost unusable, I don't think this would be enough to kill Bitcoin.  Probably just like Gox it would just delay and slow down adoption for a while.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:06:51
No, the users don't directly vote, they just can exclude their transaction from being confirmed in a block that doesn't agree with their voting preferences.  So miners who want to take an unpopular opinion may earn less from fees.
The number of transactions doesn't matter at all, since you could just do a single transaction with a large fee and the miner would earn the same amount.
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:43:28


Ironically, you've got this backwards when considering opinions expressed through code rather than online polls or forum posts.  I'll explain:
If you want to actually enforce your opinion on the correct state of the blockchain, this requires doing full validation on it, so that you can determine whether it's following or violating your expected consensus rules (whether this be 1MB block cap, 20MB, or any other hard fork changes).  By running an SPV node, you're actually forgoing your ability to enforce the rules trustlessly, and instead you're outsourcing validation to other parties that you have to trust to follow those rules for you.  These parties you trust essentially control your vote on the chain rules.
Increasing the block size penalizes fully validating nodes and encourages more SPV-validating nodes.  This means that the number of people determining the protocol rules is smaller (centralization) which makes future hard forks far easier to implement without consent of the SPV users.  By keeping blocks small enough that users can fully validate the chain, this is preserving the ability of individual users to vote with their software and enforce their own preferred consensus rules.
In short: those supporting small blocks are doing so to protect the opinions of the masses from the opinions of the few.

That's not right. Miners don't pay for their own transactions. They can include whatever transactions they want, they don't have to rank them by fee. So a miner can spam the network without paying fees.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:52:15


The subsidy is the same no matter how many transactions are in the block, so it's meaningless to talk about per-transaction subsidy.
The cost of depreciation is borne by all BTC holders, not just those who transact, so again it's meaningless to talk about per-transaction depreciation.

Make a trustless proof that unconfirmed transactions existed and were propagated to the miner prior to the block's creation, then it could be possible.  But that's the byzantine generals problem all over again.

Does anyone have a link to a whitepaper for micropayment channels?  Not the lightning network, but just the basic p2p payment channels.  I am wondering about the details, like how many blocks do you decrease the nlocktime by each time a tx is done, and wouldn't that mean that the channel quickly runs out if you're exchanging new payments by the second?  What happens if the settlement doesn't confirm before an older transaction becomes valid, so the two parties have to race to confirm their transactions.  Also do the parties exchange fully signed transactions, or they just send half signed ones and withhold their own signatures until they want to settle?

@_date: 2015-06-07 03:34:38
But if the first refund transaction is valid (nlocktime has passed), then any of the transactions signed after that can be double spent by the payor, so the payment channel is no longer trustless.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:03:50


Miners can fill blocks with as many of their own transactions as they want.  They could create an 8MB block full of nothing but filler transactions moving their own coins back and forth.  So no, not all transactions must come from users.  And that's precisely what the block cap exists for - to prevent a miner from DoS'ing the network.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:34:05

Note that you have to deposit your coins to the exchange first before you sell them (eg. send them to your CoinJar wallet).  Exchanges often require multiple confirmations before they will allow you to trade with your coins.  So, if you know you'll be wanting to sell soon, make sure you deposit them ahead of time, otherwise you could be delayed by an hour waiting for enough confirms.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:26:03
Lack of buying doesn't dictate the price in and of itself.  It's the relative strength between buying and selling (supply/demand).  Right now we're in a phase where evidently bitcoin is far more attractive to businesses than consumers, so we have merchant adoption growing at ridiculous rates and consumer adoption not moving too much.  This puts downward pressure on bitcoin prices (due to increased spending), but the low price should help to reduce this spending.
In the mining space we have miners becoming less and less profitable, so they need to sell more BTC to cover their operating costs.  This should eventually be regulated by the network difficulty level as miners decrease their investments in new hardware, but this could take some time given all the lag with chip production and preorders.
Then you have the fact that this is a bear market which encourages people to leave cash on the sidelines.  No need to go jumping all-in when the price continues to decline like this.

1. Possibly.  Fees will go up if there is more contention for block space.  This could happen if transaction volume outpaces growth in the network's TPS limit.
2. The only thing that matters is how many outputs you're spending.  The previous inputs into those outputs doesn't effect the size of your future transactions.  So there's no difference in receiving some coins vs others, the main factor is whether you receive lots of small outputs or a few larger ones.

Central banks don't compete in a "market".  Since they set supply through printing, there is no market-based supply/demand.  They essentially set the supply themselves, which allows them to target an exchange rate (just like China pegs its yuan to the dollar).  To give you an example, lets use the swiss frank vs euro.  The swiss frank was getting too strong, so the central bank says "anyone bidding to buy swiss franc above 1.3 euro, will we print the francs out of thin air and instantly fill the order".  This puts a hard ceiling on the price at 1.3 because there is *infinite supply* above that level.  Now can you see why it's not a real market?
So why would a country want to deliberately devalue its own currency?  The answer is that they want their exports to be cheap.  Lets say there's a car factory in Japan producing cars, and they want to sell these cars for 2M yen in order to make a profit and pay their employees.  If the USD/JPY exchange rate is 100, then this car will cost an american $20K USD.  Now lets say that some forex sharks start buying up yen because they can borrow it at zero interest and make money on the carry trade.  Lets say this strengthens the yen so that the USD/JPY goes to 80 yen.  Now, that same car costs an american $25K USD.  This makes Japan's auto industry less internationally competitive and will have the effect of moving jobs out of japan overseas to the countries with weaker currencies.
Now we have a situation with dwindling global trade where *every* country is in a race to devalue their currency against every other country.  The result is that *everyone* is trying to outprint eachother.  This is known as "beggar thy neighbour" policy, and a "race to the bottom".

Wall street firms aren't doing their buying on exchanges.  If anything they would be buying through Second Market's brokerage service.  Second Market sources bitcoins through BitPay, who has $1M in payments per day to offload.  They also source a lot of coins through private deals with early adopters (large holders).  SecondMarket has accumulated over 100K coins and I bet most of those were not done on exchanges.
The trading activity on the exchanges looks normal to me, but I'm no expert.  The herd always moves together - if a wall is too big, you don't want to be the first one to nibble at it because if it doesn't go down then you literally buy at the top of the market.  But then there's a critical point reached where the wall shrinks enough and buyers start to chip at it faster with bigger trades, and then very quickly the herd decides the wall is going down, and everyone buys at once, because you just know the price is going to run another $5 - $10 as soon as that wall is down.  Then after that it cools off and goes sideways for a while.

It would appear useless if you just look at it in isolation.  But consider it in terms of their overall strategy.

There is no such thing as secure zero-conf transactions.  That's why he's saying we should keep it real by not trying to pretend there's security when there isn't, as it only encourages the wrong kind of infrastructure to be built, which will be damaging in the long run when it has to be torn down and rebuilt once people finalise realise trustless zero-conf just can't be done.
It's not like the core devs disagree.  There is a comment on his pull request from Sipa, who I regard as one of the best core devs, and he said: "Anyhow, I don't see how this property of preventing 0-conf double spends can be maintained in the long term."


How about logic?  The opposition to this change is well founded.  It's a trusted service so why add it to the peer to peer network?  If you need trusted ability to query the utxo, then make it an RPC call and you can do it to a trusted node, or use electrum which already provides this.
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:57:26
Addresses aren't really a blockchain concept.  They're more of an abstraction by wallet software.   So it wouldn't really make sense to have scripts that refer to addresses.  However you can implement a dead man's switch using regular nlocktime transactions.  You just need to move the coins prior to the locktime transaction becoming valid, and reissue a new nlocktime transaction each time you make a spend.

Difficulty adjustment is also a pure function, so that is safe.
As your post mentioned, the only subjective criteria is "too far in the future", which depends on a nodes understanding of what the current time is.  However, that's not a permanent fork, because the timestamps gets less far into the future every second, eventually being acceptable.  If you're trying to split the network 50/50, then it would probably only work for a matter of seconds, and then, as someone else posted, the next block would determine the winning chain.

I noticed the same thing when using SharedCoin.  It was really obvious which output was mine because it exactly matched my input value.  To better protect privacy, it would make more sense if the outputs were all of uniform size, and went to different addresses.  So if I'm putting 1 BTC into the coinjoin, and the unit size is 0.1 BTC, I get 10 outputs to addresses I specify.

People get the same % returns from POS, so everyone's wealth stays proportionally the same.
Try running a simulation.  Give a rich guy 50% of the coins, and then give 10 poor people 5% each.  Run it over years of interest and see how it ends up.  Still the rich has 50%, poor have 5% each.

bro this is fundamental to bitcoin.  
They won't be able to spend coins they don't own, but they will be able to choose who can transact and who can't.  They can also 'roll back' history,  so for example, they make a payment, wait 6 confirms, receive delivery of goods, then roll it all back with a forked chain which reverses the payment.
@_date: 2014-07-26 11:29:00

@_date: 2014-07-08 04:13:27
How do you know fees will go up?  The graphs were observations of *current* fees required to get confirmed in the next X blocks.  By definition, they represent the *current* fees being paid.  You're probably confused because you're mixing up fee-per-kilobyte with fee-per-transaction.
Fees may go up or down in response to this - we'll see once it's live.
It's not bloating fees, it's floating fees.  Floating fees is a good thing.

The fed is printing ("quantitative easing") $85B per month.  This is $270 per US citizen per month.  Can Americans afford this?  Is it sustainable?
The difference with Bitcoin is that the future inflation schedule is completely predictable, and can therefore be priced in.  The fed policies are unpredictable, so we can only price it in on a best-guess basis, which leaves people open to be burnt by unexpected policy changes.

So you would be spending your money to an output that the receiver can't spend without a secret input to the transaction (the confirmation key) and only you have that secret.  This is the same as regular addresses, but instead of the ECDSA private key you're using this confirmation secret.  So the same double spending problem applies.  If you gave them the confirmation secret, and they use it to sweep the address, you can also race them to use your 'deny' secret to claw back the funds.  In that case the receiver will want to see 6 confirmation so be sure that the confirm message was the one accepted into the blockchain.
So basically, you'd still need to see 6 confirmations after you send the confirm or deny message.

Yes it is a beautiful coin.  Actually I bought it with fiat, but it cost the equivilent of 1 BTC.  The coin itself was about US$690, and the melt value of the silver is about $610.  You pay a premium over spot price for nice minted coins like this, but they keep that premium when you sell them.

So GHash moved some of their hashing power to other pools a few months ago in response the uproar about their high % of hash power.  Perhaps they thought they'd do themselves a favour by withholding blocks in those other pools, which reduces their own orphan rate and keeps difficulty down to up their own pool's earnings?  Sure, it's a conspiracy theory, but GHash have already established themselves as anti-social players, so it's not too far fetched.

I think as Gavin once said, we either want 1 implementation or many. If we have 2 with ~50% market share each, it risks a bad fork. But if there were 10 with 10% share each, then if one gets forked, the impact is less and it's obvious which one will need to patch.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:18:26
At least in that case we could see evidence of that on the blockchain.  Since they have to provide signatures to prove BTC reserves, we can check the addresses corresponding to the signatures, and if there was a large amount only deposited recently, which later gets moved again, then we can suspect there might be some borrowing happening.  Also if we see the same BTC's moving around the blockchain to different exchanges to prove multiple reserves, then we know something is up.

It shouldn't be that hard to explain to someone "what is bitcoin".  The trick is to not give them needless technical detail.  Like if someone asks "what is youtube?", you don't have to start explaining video codecs, tcp/ip, HTML, transcoding, load balancing, etc.  You just tell them what it is to *them* which is a place they can go on their computer to share their videos and watch other peoples' videos.
I think it's because bitcoin fans are so excited about how cool the technology is, they think it is important that everyone else understand it.

I can't follow your logic there.  If the poor person has zero disposable income ("can't afford bitcoin"), then they are living paycheck to paycheck, so deflation (falling prices) will be much better for them than inflation.  Under inflation, their standard of living gets worse and worse, and they have to fight for wage increases if they want to maintain their standard of living.
If the poor person has any spare money to save each week, then they can put it into bitcoin and enjoy the same gains as the rich people get, thus its an equal footing.
Inflation is a different story because in this case, the poor person's pay check buys less and less each week, whereas the rich person's assets keep pace with inflation.  Rich people are asset rich and aren't as sensitive to wages and cost of living.

OK so now we're defining some arbitrary threshold of "significantly" whereby people's behaviour changes?  So what is this "significantly" threshold, and how do you expect bitcoin to maintain this "significant" appreciation in value, year-after-year, when it has a fixed supply?  This would require the bitcoin economy to growing at a "significant" rate for all eternity.  But we already know that infinite growth is a failed paradigm.  Global growth is flat, or in line with population at best.  There is no way that bitcoin's value can grow faster than this once it's reached saturation.  At most we could expect perhaps 1-3% deflation.  Is this "significant"?  For many years, interest rates provided far more than 3% premium over inflation, and this didn't cause any problems.

Investing in the ETF *is* speculating on the price of BTC.  The difference is that it's so much easier for millions of people to buy an ETF than it is for them to invest in bitcoins through some other way.  There are so many millions of people who can do a few click in their online trading account to buy it, or just call up their broker and say "buy COIN".  No having to research &amp; signup with bitcoin sites, do ID verification, and manage a wallet.

They DO inflate the money supply.  They purchase the bonds and other assets with **money they don't have**.

People aren't saying there's going to be a drop in hash rate, at least not anyone who knows what they're talking about.  Difficulty has been heading north at a ridiculously exponential pace for the last 18 months that I've been watching it, and shows no sign of slowing.
You might be mixing up a similar trend that people talk about, which is miners (people) getting put out of business.  As mining becomes more and more industralized, small players, such as people running a miner in their garage, cannot profitably mine because they don't have the bulk purchasing power, or low operating costs that industrial miners have.
So yes we will see *fewer* individuals mining, but the hash rate will continue to the moon.  This is the effect of mining becoming more centralized.

Consumer protection / dispute mediation doesn't belong in the bitcoin protocol itself.  It should be built on top of it.
An analogy is TCP/IP.  IP provides no guarantee that your packet will arrive at the other end (it only makes a "best effort") and it doesn't guarantee that a sequence of packets will arrive in the same order they were sent.  Also, if you send packets to someone faster than they can receive them, the packets will just get dropped somewhere along the way.
You might complain that this is a useless way to transmit data if you can't rely on it.  But then we layer TCP on top, which provides the user with a reliable end-to-end stream which works exactly as you'd expect, because it's handling all the retransmission, flow control, ordering, etc via its own protocol layered on top of IP.
The same thing can be done with bitcoin and consumer protection.  Bitcoin provides the e-cash layer, and then services can be built on top.  Fortunately, bitcoin provides non-reversible payments.  I say "fortunately" because it's easy to build reversibility on top of non-reversibility, but impossible to do the opposite.

But of course, if there were a million transactions competing for a new block, you're going to have sky-high fees even prior to this floating fee patch.  Floating fees actually makes no difference other than to remove the hard-coded minimum fee rules and convert the fee calculation to a dyamic system based on observed supply/demand for block space.
I don't see why you see this patch as competing in any way with scalability.  The block size *will* need to rise - everyone acknowledges that, and especially Gavin has said that 100% for sure it will have to rise, and he's the one that wrote the fee patch.  As I said before, floating fees are *necessary* before the block size can start raising.  There has to be a market for block space to lay the groundwork for scaling up.

The good news is that, at this early stage in bitcoin's life, a 51% attack is only getting more and more expensive.  This trend will probably continue for at least the next couple of decades if bitcoin succeeds.  If a government had the resources to pull off a 51% attack today, they won't necessarily be able to do it in a year's time when the required resources may be far higher.
GHash was able to mount 51% but not purely through their own aquisition of hardware.  They just had a majority of miners lending their hardware to the pool.  That part is the more dangerous and broken incentive, and hopefully the market will either solve that through competition, or the developers might solve it by making non-outsourceable mining puzzles.

The transaction buying the house is creating more value than the candy bar transaction for the same amount of blockchain space, so it's only fair that they should be able to outbid for the space.
It's like if you have a person who owns prime real estate (the miner owns block space) and you're saying that they should have to sell the space to a car park earning $100/hr, rather than to a store earning $5000/hr.  Obviously it makes more economic sense for the property owner to award the space to the store since they can pay a higher price for it.

Yes, you could each provide a public key to be used in the 2-of-2 address, then you fund the address with the payment.  The seller would create a transaction to spend the multisig coins to their own personal address, but can only partially sign it.  Then send the partly signed transaction to you, and you sign it once the goods arrive.
It's not a popular way of doing things though, due to the reasons outlined by others here.  You could look at a site like BitRated which will allow you to have a third party to settle any disputes.

I think you're a little confused there.  The proposal has nothing to do with coloured coins, or coin validation or anything effecting fungibility.  It's an extension to the payment protocol (BIP70) that allows the merchant to trust a zero conf transaction because whoever is in control of that address is vouching that they won't sign a double spend.  It has been discussed on the development list and has been well received by the rest of the development community.

The reality of what we've seen so far has been a meteoric rise in every way you could measure it.  If you're going to judge it based on its market price alone over 6 months then you're not getting the full picture.  It moves in peaks and busts, and always has been this volatile (even more so).  I wasn't involved early, but I know that in 2011 it peaked at $32 and had a 6 months bear market all the way down to $2.  Price is not a very accurate way to judge whats happening with its overall growth and maturity.

The same theory is used to secure the whole internet (including your internet banking), to secure government top secret communication, remote login to every server in the world, VPN network access, etc etc.  Public/private key cryptography has been the state of the art for decades, and it is studied by some of the best mathematicians and cryptographers in the world.  Bitcoin uses ECDSA which is the current state of the art in digital signature algorithms.
PS: don't discount the meaning of the word "hard", it basically means exponential time which translates as *impossible* when you're talking about large keys.

Very awesome! I can't wait till there is something like this that supports HD wallets. From what I understand, this paper just represents a single address.
Also it would be nice if you could specify a label for the wallet, which is printed on the wallet and shared secrets, so that you can match them up if you have several different wallets printed.
PS. I noticed when I generate a wallet, it does send a unique value back to the server, eg. https//encryptedbitcoinwallet.com/6edb9448-112e-45f4-968f-1719d4ac8172.. is that the BIP38 "intermediate code"?

This is a self-regulating system.  If the yield from mining drops, those miners who are no longer profitable will be incentivised to stop mining, as it's losing them money.  This reduction in mining power has the effect of *raising* the yield for all the other miners who remain.
The same thing applies in reverse.  If the price of BTC doubles, then the returns from mining double, and suddenly you get a lot more investment into mining equipment which pushes down the mining yield until an equilibrium is reached.
This happens because Bitcoin has a self-adjusting mining "difficulty" parameter which determines how much BTC is yielded for mining effort.  See

Credit cards don't do peer-to-peer payments.  They also involve third parties who can block or reverse transactions, charge you interest, etc.  Bitcoins are fundamentally different to credit cards because it's digital cash, so when you have bitcoin on your phone, it's really on your phone, not like an internet banking app where your money is actually with the bank.  Credit cards also give you way less privacy because a core part of making a payment is giving out your name and CC number.

There's companies already doing that.  Eg, BitPay etc can place nodes around the network to try to detect double spends as early as possible.  I think Mycelium has a Transaction Radar feature that tries to do the same thing.
It's not a guarantee though.  As always, there's no magical way to get around the need for confirmations for security, and trying to prevent zero-conf double spends is usually just giving people a false sense of security.

$5K by 2026 is a very conservative forecast if we're considering a case where Bitcoin is successful.  It would more likely be 6 figures or more by that time.  If it hasn't reached $5K in 12 years time, it will have certainly failed, and so security is not a relevant concern since the whole currency will be irrelevant.  I don't think anyone here is under the delusion that there's not a possibility of failure, but the reason we choose to be part of this is because we believe it can succeed.  I think we'll see $5K this year or next.

You digitally sign the transaction using your private key.  The signature proves to everyone else mathematically that you must know the private key, but it does not tell them the private key.  The signature is only valid for that exact transaction - if the transaction changed, a different signature would be required.
Think of it like a real signature - people can view it and verify it, but can't necessarily produce it themselves.  Digital signatures are cryptographically strong and are unique to the content they are signing.
@_date: 2014-03-26 07:10:37
Sounds like cryptography is not for you, then.  All computer security is based upon problems for which no known efficient solution exists, but where there is no proof that one doesn't exist.  You totally underestimate the significance of cryptography.  The whole world relies heavily on it.  I suggest you throw your computer in the bin if you can't handle that.
It is impossible to obtain someone's private key given their public key, if it was generated securely (using a cryptographically strong RNG).
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:45:26
Really good talk.  There were only a few factual errors that I noticed:
- He said that the content of every wallet is publicly observable and everyone can see how money is in it.  Actually only the balances of individual addresses are publicly viewable.  Wallets are collections of addresses, and there is no public association between addresses in a wallet unless they are linked via a transaction.
- He made it sound like it's not possible to have decent security without a third party.  It is actually possible to have very high levels of protection against both theft and loss without any third party, if you know what you are doing.  Over time this will hopefully get easier for average people to do.
- He said that the capping of coins at 21 million is just a red herring and nothing to worry about.  Actually, no one knows what will happen when the block reward goes to 0.  It's uncharted territory - we don't even know what will happen with block sizes, fees, and mining centralisation.  It's definitely something we need to pay attention to.

The inflation schedule is a non-negotiable.  Are you suggesting that we change the 21 million coin cap, or change the halving-every-four-years schedule?  Because if we're keeping those rules the same, then the value of new bitcoins created *must* be &lt;number of coins&gt; * &lt;bitcoin price&gt; per year.  No change of consensus algorithm will change this.  And since we will have so many millions, or billions of dollars worth worth of new coins mined in a year, the equivalent value will be invested to mine them until the cost of production becomes only marginally profitable.  Whether this means spending money on large mining data centers, or funding millions of sybil nodes to influence a voting system, it will happen either way, because if there's money to be made mining, everyone will do it until it becomes unprofitable.
Also, I disagree that the $650M is supposed to "purchase decentralisation".  What it's really purchasing, if anything, is security.  In the context of bitcoin, we can measure security by the amount it would cost an attacker to mount a 51% attack.  Right now, that's ~1800 BTC per day, or nearly $1M/day.  The more the cost of BTC rises, we can expect the expenditure by miners to rise equivilently, which in turn makes an attack even more expensive.  By this definition, there is no such thing as getting the same security for a cheaper cost, because it's the cost itself that defines the level of security.

Yeah.  I haven't invested for that reason.  There's no actual info on how the shares work.  I'm guessing that the shares go up in hash rate, but I also think that PETA might issue new shares from time to time (such as when they get new hardware), which dilutes your share of the pool.  That, or they take a big fee from everyones returns.  They probably also profit from market making on the stock.  Otherwise I just can't see how they have an incentive to keep working hard when the hashrate is owned by everyone else.

I think you're not understanding "propagated".  It's different to confirmation (confirmation is when your transaction is put into a new block).  Propagation occurs instantly.  When you send a transaction to your peers, they will validate it, and if it's valid they'll forward it on to their peers, etc, and within a matter of seconds it's reached most nodes in the mesh network (including the pools).  If you try to then re-spend the coins by sending a 2nd transaction, it won't propagate, because the current behaviour of bitcoin-core is to not propagate double spends.  So your 2nd transaction never gets anywhere.
But there is nothing to stop people modifying their node/pool to behave differently, which is why it is prudent to wait for a confirmation.

They need to be careful about this.  If the recipient has a copy of the original transaction (eg. if they were peered with CoinJar's node and saved it), they can rebroadcast it later to get the money.
CoinJar shouldn't be "reversing" the transaction, they should instead re-spend the same inputs in a new transaction.

Firstly, I'm not really a big supporter of side chains, but you seem to be missing the point.


This is the point.  Currently to make any consensus changes to bitcoin, you need to get everyone to adopt a hard fork / soft fork.  Thus the pace of innovation is very slow.  We see much faster innovation happening in altcoins because anyone can create a new altcoin to do 'anything', even destroy keys or use broken cryptography (although why would anyone use such a coin?).
So by making a small change to bitcoin (allowing sidechains), and only stipulating that coins can move onto a sidechain and back, it means there are no barriers to alternative blockchain implementations.  The users will decide which sidechains are useful and adoption will grow accordingly.  Bad sidechains won't get used.
The other benefit is that all of the hashing power from alt chains would be united and help to secure the main bitcoin chain.  And as the sidechains devs say, it unifies "digital scarcity" so that bitcoin is the one scarce asset that all other blockchains are backed by (although whether this is good or bad could be debated).

Don't transmit your private keys through any third parties unless they are strongly encrypted (eg. AES-128 cipher, key stretching, and a password with at least 80 bits of entropy).  If you're trying to move coins from A to B, best to do it via a blockchain transaction which doesn't require any revealing on private keys.
I would recommend moving the coins to a new address unless you're absolutely sure what you did was secure.
Best practice (for long term cold storage) is to never move your private keys at all.  Generate them offline and keep them there.

Most operating systems will source entropy from hardware where possible, and will also use other sources like random jitter from the kernel, and then they might use an algorithm to mix those sources.
Often they will save some entropy away to be available immediately on boot.
I believe bitcoin uses proper openssl routines which will wait for entropy if it isn't available, but I'm not an expert on that.  Unless you're running on really crappy hardware that has low entropy, you shouldn't have any issues.

They'll get a few millibits for those commits.  I know it's just a nice little bonus, but that money alone wouldn't fund their work.  However something like lighthouse actually would fund that kind of work.

It's a hack in the sense that OP_HASH160 {hash of script} OP_EQUAL does not explicitly contain any instructions to evaluate the serialised script in the scriptSig.  Rather than run the script as per normal, bitcoin is hard coded to recognise the specific format of script and enact some extra behaviour.
I believe at the time there was debate around the best implementation.  OP_EVAL (BIP12) and OP_CHECKHASHVERIFY (BIP17) were competing solutions, but in the end BIP16 won the vote.   It's a hack but it's simpler than the alternatives.

Not sure what you're trying to say, but my point is that miners are making small blocks and they will continue to do so regardless of block size limits.  They will continue to include transactions based on fee-per-kilobyte regardless of the contents of the transaction.  Your theory about them wanting to include transactions for the greater good of the network is nice, but if you look at the reality you'll see that the opposite is true.. miners are deliberately ignoring transactions and keeping their block sizes small to minimise orphan costs to maximise their own profit.
Bitcoin's transaction rate will remain low until this dynamic changes (eg. when the block reward becomes small enough, or block representation is compacted, or networks become faster, or the chain length calculation is modified to include a hybrid PoW/days-destroyed metric).

But Mike Hearn did point out that it's actually dangerous to use SPV validation for this and showed an example of how a malicious actor could  mine a block that causes your miners to hop pools.  This could cause miners running your software to leave honest pools and join a dishonest pool to actively help attack the network.  I like your idea, but it needs full validation to work.
Also, what would be the outcome if people were running this?  It seems like it's just an added sense of security, so if we see GHash nearing 50% again, are we supposed to panic less because we suspect they won't be able to do an attack?  Wouldn't panicking less be a bad thing since it will relax peoples attitudes towards mining centralisation?

Users still have a choice of what validation rules they accept.  If miners hard fork and change those validation rules, their chain will become invalid to everyone else who hasn't changed their software.
You would need to have all users *voluntarily* update their software.
What miners do is provide security.  If they all left to mine on an unfair fork, it would mean that the unfair fork is more secure, and the old legacy chain would be left less secure.  It would be up to users of the currency to decide whether they want to be on the side of more security but less fairness, or more fairness and less security.
Don't understimate the power of the big economic players too.  I believe they would be more influential than miners in choosing a fork.  If the new fork isn't accepted by bitpay, coinbase, bitstamp, blockchain.info, mycelium, etc etc etc, then they're not going to be very useful.  Each of those merchants / services can make their *own* decision as to which chain they operate on.
There is some game theory too - the first movers to the new chain take the most risk, because the new chain is worthless until the broader economy starts moving over too.  In the meantime, miners on that chain are losing bitcoins in the hope that their new chain will come to dominate.  If the new chain has unfair rules, like increasing the coin limit, they're just wasting their time.

It's a decentralized, trustless ledger.  Everything else (like cloud storage) is either centralized or trust-based.

OK, I've pushed it to the network now.  It's here: 
I notice that it has a dust output (1 satoshi) so this is probably why no one is relaying it.  There's currently a dust rule where transactions with outputs below 5430 satoshis aren't relayed.
EDIT:  I don't think that's ever going to confirm though.  Blockchain.info has it, but their peers probably won't relay it either.  I tried pushing to Eligius, who accepts non-standard transactions, and even they are rejecting it.
You might have to just make your wallet forget about the tx and re-send it with a higher amount.

"bad blocks"?  So long as a block contains valid transactions, then it's valid.  If you see a spend appear in two separate forks, there's no way to tell which came first, that's why you trust the chain with the most proof-of-work.  The mini-proof miners would simply mine on the chain with the most proof-of-work, like with all mining.

Buy a super cheap, piece of shit printer. The cheaper ones are less likely to have any built-in storage. Then when you're done with it, smash it to pieces and burn it. Once you're sure all the chips are melted, make sure the ash is grated down to a fine powder.  Stir the power around until it is well mixed.  Separate the mixed powder into several separate bags.  Dispose of the contents of each bag on different days of the week, in bins at different locations.  Remember to pour the actual contents of the bag into the bin to spread it out, don't leave it together in the bag.  This will make it difficult for an attacker to re-assemble the components from the smouldered ash.

Proof-of-work is the mechanism by which we can form a distributed consensus.  The problem of distributed consensus is formalized in the [Byzantine Generals Problem](
To explain the problem in layman's terms:  If we want to have a global public ledger where everyone maintains a copy and everyone agrees, then how do we handle disputes?  What if I install Bitcoin, and connect to some nodes who are each telling me conflicting information about the state of the ledger - who do I believe?  We can't just agree by counting the number of votes from peers, because on the internet it's easy for one person to create millions of nodes to rig the vote (called a Sybil attack).  Also we can't just trust our friends because then we build a giant web-of-trust that can easily fragment into disagreeing segments.  Satoshi gave us the solution for building a distributed, trustless, irrefutable global ledger where everyone and anyone could participate and easily form consensus with one another - even newcomers who never saw what happened in the past can arrive on the network and know with a high degree of confidence what the entire history of the ledger is.
The way that this consensus is formed is through proof-of-work, and you really need to read Satoshi's paper to appreciate it.  Basically, proof-of-work means that I can send you a piece of data, and you can look at it and easily prove mathematically that a certain amount of "work" has been spent to produce that data.  What is "work"?  It means computational work, so someone has burnt CPU cycles (or GPU or ASIC cycles) to produce that data, and you don't have to take their word for it, because you can see it in the data itself.  Why is that useful?  Because work is naturally rate limited.  We don't have unlimited computational resources.  If the bitcoin network is burning 300 Petahash of computing power to produce new blocks, your little ARM CPU on your phone can mathemtically verify that instantly with a few quick calculations, so you know that the ledger you are seeing was produced by millions of dollars worth of equipment.  If an attacker wants to fool you, they better start producing millions of dollars worth of hardware to do it.
The brilliant thing about "mining" is that it combines the proof-of-work security with an incentive model (newly generated coins + fees) and has one simple rule: the longest chain (chain with the most work) is the true chain.   So this provides an incentive for everyone to work together to build the longest chain, which means that an attacker has to gain 51% of the network's hash power if they want to produce the longest chain.

This is used in critical parts of the core code such as calculating the reward per block:
    int64_t GetBlockValue(int nHeight, int64_t nFees)
    {
        int64_t nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
        int halvings = nHeight / Params().SubsidyHalvingInterval();
        // Force block reward to zero when right shift is undefined.
        if (halvings &gt;= 64)
            return nFees;
    
        // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.
        nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings;
    
        return nSubsidy + nFees;

Because there's very little barrier to entry for setting up an alt-coin exchange if you don't deal with fiat money.  Just write some code, set up a site and you're done.  If you're interfacing with the banking system then you've got to jump through all sorts of legal hoops and paperwork etc.  The exchanges that have bothered to get set up with banks are generally big operations and they don't deal with low volume alt coins.  For the smaller altcoins you need to go to places like cryptsy or even worse, some of the others, and you can trade them there.

Actually the way it works is different to that.  Nodes don't track address balances, they instead maintain a list of unspent transaction outputs.  You need to read up on how transaction inputs/outputs work to understand this:
You can read more about transactions here: 
Basically your transaction contains 'inputs' which are references to previous transactions.  You don't just spend from an address, you spend previous transactions you received.    So it's easy to detect a double spend because they will be two transactions that are trying to spend the same inputs.

That makes the problem worse.  It gives selfish miners a 50% chance of winning the race.  Currently they have less than 50% chance because they have to try to get their block to arrive before the rival block, but since they broadcast 2nd, they are behind in the race.  This is the part of the selfish mining theory that totally ignores latency.
Also, there is no incentive for a mining pool to waste 3 seconds, knowing that they're working on a block that will be orphaned.  Pools just simply wouldn't do it, it is more profitable to switch to the first block as soon as it's seen.

ChangeTip is a service acting as an intermediary.  I deposit Bitcoins to ChangeTip, then I can go on Reddit, Twitter, Youtube or whatever and issue ChangeTip commands to tip people.  The changetip bot sees those tips and moves the money from my balance to their balance, and then if the receiver has a ChangeTip account they can withdraw the bitcoins to their own wallet.
Bitcoin is a digital currency, which is basically like cash for the internet.  It can be used without any intermediaries at all, eg. I could send money directly to you with no one in the middle, but to do that you would need to give me a Bitcoin address (which looks like 14vBLTSUdvkUSVJqoxps6wujhvjY25ZvLb and is generated by your wallet software).

Yep, to create new coloured coins you need a small amount of BTC (I think it is 600 satoshi per coloured coin).  To create new coloured coins, you need to do a genesis transaction which is a special type of transaction that the coloured coin wallet knows how to do.  It won't cost you anything except for the miner fee on the transaction + the small amount of BTC that you need to use to represent the coins.  Yes you can burn coloured coins to remove their colour and just use them as plain BTC.  All coloured coin transactions are blockchain transactions though so you'll need to pay a miner fee every time (the fee is paid with non-coloured BTC).
As far as the blockchain is concerned, there is no coloured coins.  It's just an abstraction built on top, like putting TCP segments inside IP packets.

People don't have to perceive the fundamentals to want bitcoin.  Only speculators will do that.  You've been disappointed because you were expecting a wave of speculators to come after you, and they haven't.  Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme, and its success does not depend on ever more speculators to drive the price.
People will use bitcoin because they HAVE to use bitcoin.  I've always believed that there will emerge a new, thriving growth economy based around digital currency, no tax, no regulation, and decentralised systems.  People will be driven into the crypto economy because there will be amazing products and services that they simply *cannot* purchase with fiat, because they're not for sale with fiat, because selling those services with fiat would not even be possible.  Think about stuff like MaidSafe.  It's not possible to have a decentralized compute cloud without cryptocurrency to pay for it.  OpenBazaar is another example.  Lighthouse (if it ever comes out) will hopefully be another killer app.
It's one step at a time though.  We all need to keep working hard and building the future that we believe in.

But the value of bitcoins won't forever appreciate.  The rise in price only happens on its path from $0 to full maturity.  The number of bitcoins is stable, fixed at 21M.  Once BTC reaches its full adoption level, there's nowhere higher for it to go, and then its value moves only as the supply/demand for money moves which will be determined by economic growth / contraction.  This is the mistake people make in thinking that bitcoin is deflationary, where it is actually stable.


I assume you meant deflating, but again bitcoin does not deflate, it's stable, so if BTC becomes our global currency then asset prices will be stable.  Prices will only drop if the economy grows, and the economy only grows if people are investing, not hoarding.  Hoarding would result in economic contraction which would eventually result in higher asset prices (inflation) since there is more money in circulation per good/service.  If you can understand this part then you'll see that the system is self regulating - hoarding money eventually results in higher prices, and spending money eventually results in lower prices due to its stimulus effect causing a growth in real goods/services available, so the system keeps a nice equilibrium price for bitcoin which is equivilent to the demand of money vs the supply of economic goods/services.


But BTC is fundamentally different to the fiat money system where ALL money is debt-based.  With the fiat system, all money is borrowed and even leveraged up through fractional reserve banking.  With BTC it's impossible that we'll have 10x fractional banking because BTC ownership is provable and no one is going to deposit money into a bitcoin bank that has 10% reserves when they can withdraw it and have it 100% backed.  A leveraged bitcoin bank will collapse faster than you can say "bank run".  The most that can be leant with bitcoin is 1x money, and interest rates will be determined by the true risk of default rather than being manipulated by a central bank to create debt bubbles, which is only possible through their ability to print money.  Bottom line is that I don't believe that it's possible to BTC to ever see anywhere near the level of leverage that is in the current fiat system.


I don't see it like that.  The real assets still have the same real economic value, it's just prices changing, which indicates that the demand for money has increased vs the supply of goods/services.  This naturally encourages savings to turn into investments, thus the system regulates itself.  This would only happen if the economy is expanding (like whats happening now - the bitcoin economy is rapidly expanding), so eventually this will be bound by real global economic growth, which at the moment is close to flat or declining.

That's the expected amount of time.  For example, if you're rolling two six-sided dice and want to get snake eyes (two 1's), you could get it first roll, or it could take you 100 rolls, but if you do it repeatedly over time the number of rolls will average 36.  So you can say that it would take around 36 rolls to get snake eyes, but it's just an average.
The averages are more meaningful over a large number of samples, so if you rolled the dice 3600 times it's likely you'll get close to 100 snake eyes.  The likelihood of different outcomes forms a bell curve (poisson distribution?)

Do you use bitcoin?  You can buy coffee, or get paid in it, and volatility doesn't prevent this from being possible.
Also the price doesn't double or halve in a matter of hours.  Lately it's ~5%-ish per day.
Regardless of volatility, bitcoins always retain value so they can always be used to transfer value peer-to-peer over the internet, which plenty of people find useful.
As the markets and liquidity grow, expect to see a more stable price.

Bitcoin is open source code, it just requires patching to change.  The objects that bitcoin uses are versioned to support future upgrades and backwards compatibility:
- Transactions - 
- Addresses - 
There have been numerous hardforks in the past.
Bitcoin transactions are validated using a scripting language ( which is flexible enough to support many different transaction types.  For instance, the instruction OP_HASH160 currently means to run 2 rounds of SHA-256 and then 1 round of RIPEMD-160 on the item at the top of the stack, but there could be made a version 2 transaction where the same instruction means to run a SHA-1 hash.  To move your funds to a more secure v2 address you'd just need to transfer them via the blockchain to a new v2 address.

- Have a pre-signed nlocktime transaction  (signed by you and the third party) , so that after X days you know you can get your funds back into an address you control, even if the third party dissapears.
- If you want to access your money prior to the X day delay, you need a signature from yourself and the third party.  This is where the third party has a policy to protect you: eg. max spend per day, or some process where you have to approve transactions over a certain amount.
- If someone wants to rubber hose you, they would need to hold you hostage for X days until the nlocktime tx is valid, or otherwise they have to somehow walk you into the third party's office and get you to request an authorisation without them realising you're a hostage.

I'm not sure why anyone would invest in fiat currencies, as they seem like an obvious scam.  Firstly, they are not even mineable.  The supply is completely monopolised by the developers who have given themselves trusted ability to insta-mine any number of coins on demand.  These currencies may claim to have a stable supply, but any such promises are just developer policies, not actually enforced in the code.
Secondly, the ledger is hierarchical, not distributed.  There is a stake-based reward that can be claimed *only* when you are deposited with trusted third parties.  The stake rate is again just a policy controlled by devs which can be changed arbitrarily and is not actually tied to the rate of new coins.  If you choose to store your coins yourself, you're effectively losing money since you don't get your stake rewards.
There is a 2-tiered transaction system which again favours those who deposit with third parties.  If you're doing p2p payments these are severely limited in function due to physical exchange being the only available method of transfer.
I'd be very careful trusting your money with this system which is obviously designed to make the developers rich.

Bitcoin is decentralised, and so there is no central place to register to use it.  Instead, all you need to do is get a wallet (see   Once you have a wallet, you will be able to generate new addresses to receive your first bitcoins to.
Since bitcoin is valuable, it is unlikely that people will just send you coins for free. So most people buy them.  There are many places you can buy them from, and some of these require you to register an account with your personal details.  Be careful with who you buy from, make sure you do your research first.


Your bitcoins are saved in the "blockchain" which is a global cryptographic ledger stored on the computers of everyone who participates in the bitcoin network.  But to spend your coins, you need your "private keys", and these are only stored in your wallet.  You need to keep those keys secure to prevent theft, and make sure you back up your wallet to prevent losing the keys (otherwise you could lose your coins forever).


The best way is to buy bitcoins or to accept them if you own a business.  Mining has advanced to the point where it requires highly specialised hardware now.  Mining on your computer will be far too slow to earn any bitcoins.  It's not worth trying to get into mining unless you really understand what you're doing.
My advice would be to take things slowly and make sure you properly research everything before you do it.  Don't get scammed, don't get your bitcoins stolen, and don't lose them by mistake.  If you take some time and patience to learn about bitcoin, you will become confident with it.

You are right.  The max block size needs to increase as well.  The IBLT is just a network message used to construct the block, but the block itself is still going to be huge if it contains a million transactions.

@_date: 2014-03-25 07:46:31
Nope you're wrong.  There is a real cost to the miner for every transaction they add to the block.  It's not free.  Every additional byte added to a block increases the propogation time which increases their orphan cost.  If block space was free then you'd see much larger blocks now.  Miners are deliberately ignoring transactions with small fees because it ends up costing them more than the fee to include them.  Just look at the size of the blocks coming out of the big pools.  Upping the max block size is unlikely to result in larger blocks.

I think I understand what you're saying.  You're talking about a binary search, which gives logarithmic time lookups.  As I was saying before, the utxo index does already provide logarithmic time lookups.
When validating a tx, there isn't a need to actually go finding the input transactions in the blockchain, as the utxo index is sufficient.  So the structure of the blockchain itself does not effect the speed of the utxo checks.  The blockchain is structured as a timestamped sequence of blocks for the reasons stated in Satoshi's paper.

Buyers and sellers have to agree on a price before a trade can occur.
If you're just hitting a "sell" button then you're making an at-market order, which means you'll be selling to whoever has the highest bid.  Likewise, an at-market buy is matched with the lowest offer.
The other type of order is a limit order.  You specify the price you want to buy or sell at (eg. sell at $1000), and the order will sit in the order book until someone is willing to match your trade.

Not necessarily.  An efficient recovery of priv keys may require the broken priv keys.  That's why you release the code and let people generate their own broken keys with new entropy, and then once they've proved their solution works, it can be applied to gox's broken keys.
In the case where the priv keys can be deterministically generated from only the source code, then they shouldn't release it, which is why I'm suggesting an audit from a cryptographer first.

You don't need to bring a computer with you.  You just need to tell them the address to send the bitcoins to.  Easiest way is to just show them a QR code image on your phone (eg. load up the blockchain.info site on your phone, enter your address, then bring up the QR code image).  Or, you could just print it on paper.  You can also check blockchain.info for confirmations if you are paranoid about that.  I'd usually just accept the deal as done as soon as the tx is broadcast, so long as the person seems honest and they've put an adequate fee on the tx.
There's absolutely no need to bring along your private key.

You have to look at what's going on in the broader bitcoin ecosystem to guide you on future price.  It's a combination of growing merchant adoption, growing innovation from startups &amp; venture capital funding, growing distrust in the traditional banking system, countered by government regulation risks, arrests, countries banning it, people getting hacked, etc.  Then there's also technical issues that could effect things, eg. scalability.

Wouldn't this still end up with a race to the bottom and everyone operating at marginal profitability?  Rather than spending money on power, you're just going to outspend eachother on amassing hardware for proof-of-idle.  The same game theory applies, if you're operating at high profit, you can spend more money on hardware to make more profit at the expense of others, hence the race to the bottom occurs as per the graphs he showed.
It would be good for the environment though, not using all the power.
I also wonder about the incentives.  You could participate in a contract to get paid to not mine, then mine anyway, and if the network overall slows down then you made extra money.  So people who are going to mine anyway would always participate in these contracts and profit from them at the expense of the people who really did stop mining.

They critical point is when you generate the key. Doesn't matter if it's an electrum seed on paper, a bip38 private key, or a USB drive with a wallet.dat.

After that point, it just comes down to the physical security of your storage, which is easy and doesn't require any technical skills.

Rich people have their wealth in inflation-protected assets (stocks, real estate, businesses).  They aren't as effected by inflation as the middle class who have their savings eroded and cost of living constantly going up.
Inflation is the symptom of money printing, and money printing is the symptom of broke governments who want to keep spending.  BTC is the cure in that it will bankrupt these governments and allow the private sector to begin recovering.

A hard fork is when previously-invalid blocks become valid.
A soft fork is when previously-valid blocks become invalid.
Under a soft fork, nodes running the old version will accept new blocks just fine.  A hard fork, on the other hand, will cause a definite split of the chain, which can only be fixed by upgrading the old nodes, or downgrading the new nodes.

When you spend bitcoins from an address, you have to reveal the full public key, and its hash must match the address.
edit: here's an example for you.  I picked a random transaction on blockchain.info:
If you scroll down to "input scripts", you can see that each input script is quite large, as it contains a signature, followed by a full public key.  The output scripts are shorter, because they just contain the pubkey HASH for the address they are spending to.

I think you're confusing rising BTC prices with rising other prices.  When BTC price goes up, this means the price of goods goes DOWN when priced in BTC.  That's why it's deflation.  Deflation is associated with *falling* prices of goods and services.  So, since we observe a pickup in spending when bitcoin's price rises, this indicates the opposite to the conventional thinking.  It indicates that consumption RISES under deflation.
Also, my example wasn't claiming they'd wait longer for the TV.  In fact, my example claimed the opposite - they'll wait longer when there's inflation, because it takes them longer to save for it.

Haha.  I first heard about bitcoin when it got slashdotted, looked into it, but I didn't grasp the significance and decided it was too risky to invest (I think it was ~$10 at the time).  But since 2011 I was following zerohedge a lot, and in 2013 they kept covering its rally during the cyprus problems.  After seeing enough zerohedge articles, I took a deeper look and decided I wanted to buy.  It was just breaking $100 for the first time at that point, but by the time I could make my first purchase it was already $160.  The bubble peaked a couple of days later and it crashed, but I was hooked from then on.  So I guess I can thank zerohedge too :)

The lesson from this thread is: use deterministic wallets.  Write down your seed and that will contain all your private keys for the next million years, change addresses included.
For those who don't know how deterministic wallets work, the single seed generates an infinite series of addresses in a deterministic fashion.  So you only need to write down the initial seed once and from this can derive all private keys you use in the future.
Non-deterministic wallets generate all new addresses randomly.  The ability to spend from these addresses relies on the wallet file containing each and every private key for all addresses.  That means you have to backup regularly and need to be careful about data corruption in the wallet file.
Electrum is a good deterministic wallet.  It has its own custom method for generating the addresses, but soon most wallets will switch over to BIP32 (HD Wallets), which will be a standard way to do deterministic wallets.  BIP32 seeds should be portable between wallets that support it.

If you want to be scientific about it, start by observing reality and then try to understand why things are the way they are.  The reality is that people are spending bitcoins in ever more valuable quantities.  If you start with your hypothesis of "no one has a reason to spend" and try to justify it, you're doing things wrong.
I spent .02 BTC on $20 worth of goods the other day.  I'm fine with that because I can repurchase that .02 for $20 today , tomorrow, next week, and theres a good chance it will even be *cheaper* to repurchase.  Bitcoin doesn't go up in a strait line FYI.

@_date: 2014-08-13 07:45:19
They are deterministic (BIP32).
If you're familiar with hash functions, think about a simplified exaple where you did:
    Privkey 1 = SHA256(seed+1)
    Privkey 2 = SHA256(seed+2)
    ...
    Privkey N = SHA256(seed+N)
As you can see, you can produce a near-endless sequence from the seed, with each value being indistinguishable from a random 256-bit number.

It's more the other way around.  Wallets know that a specific private key / address belongs to it, because they store it in their wallet file.

That's called the Byzantine Generals problem.  Satoshi solved that with his proof-of-work blockchain, using the "chain with the most work is the valid one" rule.  It's trivial for someone to decide which of the two options to accept, and it involves no trust at all.

That's describing how much the protocol can scale.  It's not discussing whether or not pools would participate in this.  It doesn't once mention orphan costs.
Even if the block limit were raised to 10MB tomorrow, there's no way you'd see any pools making blocks that big.  Their profits would decline too much so everyone would leave their pool for more profitable ones.
BTW, the reason for the propagation delays is mostly the network latency/throughput, not the signature processing.  Signature processing time is negligible, as the doc says.

Because that's up to the miners and out of your control.  You could be priced out indefinitely by other transactions with higher fees, they might reject your transaction due to a difference in client implementation, your signature might have a weakness and someone double spends your money (ala android bug), someone could have stolen your private key and be racing you to spend.  Sure it's likely that your unconfirmed transactions will be confirmed, but you shouldn't stake money on it.  You need to see 6 confirms before you can be sure that a transaction was successful.

In this transaction, you've got 3 non-dust inputs from 1PqJ1TFjwrnVzUtUKqH3b2sTvqtfA5X5pU (0.00043761, 0.0000624, and 0.127), which totals 0.12750001 BTC.  For the outputs you're paying 1 satoshi to 149LNxxSKzdES1Aszp4LCwmVJTLJYnVVoh, 0.127 BTC to 1G3VSBpcGngGPbvFsSQ24mPJnKDDebN4iK, and the remaining 0.0005 as miner's fee.
Who are you trying to pay?   149LNxxSK or 1G3VSBpc?  It looks like you're trying to send 1 satoshi.  If that's not the case, and you're trying to send 0.127 to 1G3VSBpc, then you should make a new tx with a single output, and just add the 1 satoshi to the miner's fee.

Yeah, which just comes back to PoW being the basis for security.  If you switch a PoW chain over to PoS, then it's only a matter of time until someone can catch up to the amount of PoW and break the security.  You're just leaving a danging carrot for attackers because it's easy to overtake a chain that isn't moving (in terms of sum of work to produce).  That's why bitcoin is secure, because the network is *constantly* growing the longest chain.  You need to amass more than 50% computation power so that you can *overtake* the chain.

The mint that produces these coins is in my country, so its inefficient if it gets shipped overseas to Amagi and then shipped back to me in Australia.  I think what I might do though is contact Perth Mint and ask them to accept bitcoin.  You never know, if enough people ask maybe they will do it.
Update:  I just emailed them and told them how Amagi and Agora have done $10M+ in sales each, and also mentioned Peter Schiff getting on board.  Hopefully they are open to it. They do about $6Bn in sales annually, so this would be huge.

The fee is per kilobyte, which is not dependent on the amount being transacted, but the amount of inputs/outputs in the transaction.  To continue the bills analogy, there are more inputs if you're paying with lots of small change compared to one large bill.  This is because the blockchain needs to store all the information about your transaction, and blockchain storage comes at a premium (it's stored on thousands of peoples hard drives around the world :)).  The fee is voluntary but it's also your way of bidding for the space, and the miners can choose whose transactions they include in their blocks, so incentivising them with an appropriate fee is a good way to make sure you get confirmed in the next block.
@_date: 2014-03-25 09:50:13


Actually, you have a financial incentive to *not* include them unless their fee-per-kilobyte is greater than the orphan cost.  At the moment, empty blocks are the most profitable, especially for a smaller pool.  See "orphan costs" as I described in my other post.
EDIT: and hence "tragedy of the commons".  Smaller blocks = personal gain, but network suffers.  Larger blocks = personal loss but network benefits.

The Bitcoin Investment Trust publishes their "Net Assets" and "NAV per share" statistics daily on   Based on this information, it's easy to derive the number of shares in the fund.  On March 31st, I recorded the stats which indicated ~971k shares in the fund.  As of today, there are ~1022k shares in the fund.  Meaning, 51.2k new shares were issued.  Based on the share price over the period, I estimate this represents somewhere between $2M and $2.5M USD inflow in 2 weeks.

You get very good rates because the rate is determined by your bank (eg. Citibank) rather than the ATM.  The ATM just requests X amount of local currency from the bank, and adds its fee in local currency.  You can contact your bank about exchange rates, but I'm pretty sure Citibank do the Visa rate, which is around 1% on big curencies, maybe bigger on currencies like Zlotti, but it's way better than any currency exchange booth or bitcoin ATM will charge you.

Once you go down the rabbit hole of "intrinsic value", you find that it's very hard to justify that there's some special intrinsic value backing paper money that isn't there with bitcoin.
The other fallacy here is that governments, GDP, and tax revenue backs up fiat money.  The reality is that governments don't create wealth, it's the private sector that creates real wealth.  Governments actually sap wealth from the private economy via taxation and bureaucracy.  So if you're going to argue that the economy is what gives money value, then it should be acknowledged that its the labour of everyone, you and me, who give it value, not governments.  Bitcoin is a people's currency, and a people's economy.  The bitcoin economy gives bitcoin value in the same way that the fiat economy can give fiat value - only we have a lot more freedom and low friction, and at the core of the BTC economy is a sound money that can't be debased.

There are several options.  You can sell in-person using local bitcoins or mycelium.  Otherwise, you can sell through an exchange which will give you an official record of having sold the coins (there's no reason to be too paranoid about this unless you're doing money laundering or something).
So for exchanges, it depends what country you're in.  If it's Australia, try CoinJar.  I use them and they're pretty good, although they charge a 2%ish fee.

GBT is the ideal solution, but rather than hoping for pools to adopt it, miners should be the ones forcing them to adopt it.  If everyone left the major pools to join GBT pools, then all pools would be forced to adopt it to meet the demands of the market.  Again, unfortunately miners don't seem to care, as long as they can leave their device running and get a stream of income, they don't want to think any further than that.
It's the same as how consumers will always buy a cheaper product if faced with 2 equal choices.  It doesn't matter if one of them is environmentally friendly, and the other destroys the environment.

It's a real issue and it sounds like the developers have been aware of it for some time, but it seems that they may have underestimated the impact that it could have.  Gox have had an unknown amount of bitcoin stolen from users exploiting transaction malleability to fool gox into thinking a withdrawal failed when it in fact succeeded.  I would guess that there are other sites using the same method to validate withdrawals, and if so they might be victims of the same exploit.
If we start seeing other sites halting withdrawals in response to this, we'll know it's serious.

If there is an end to the US dollar hegemony, this means there is a flight from USD assets and a resulting high inflation /  hyperinflation in the US.  (Especially given that most US Dollars are currently overseas as reserve assets, these will begin to come back into the domestic economy fast).
I think crypto will hopefully be an attractive option when people look to protect their wealth from the massive loss in purchasing power.  But the BTC ecosystem/infrastructure needs to be ready to handle mainstream users, so hopefully something like this doesn't happen too soon before bitcoin is ready.

Agreed.  We need people who are able to talk calmly without being fired up or emotional.  They need to show tolerance and understanding for people who are not bitcoin experts, who have genuine questions about it.  Like when the reporter asked why can't someone hack it and make more coins, I think it's a bit rude to respond with "But that's a fundamental misunderstanding of how bitcoin works!".  It's kind of like saying "you're stupid".  There's no need to get so defensive.
Gavin Andersen's approach is much better.  See his interview with CFR here: 
He shows tolerance and respect for the questions thrown at him, and he doesn't come across as an emotional fanatic.  I think his approach gives people confidence in Bitcoin and encourages them to open their minds and research it more.

It's more of a conceptual thing.  "Coin" could be whatever you want.  Most CS papers will describe algorithms without mentioning any specific data types, because they apply to many data types.

You can't judge the security of a system by doing some game-theoretical analysis of it.  You start by assuming a motivated attacker, and look at what is and isn't possible for them to do.

If the cap increases, it basically forks the currency and you have two currencies, one with the original rules and the new one with the new rules.  It's up to users and merchants to decide which currency they place value in.  The network effect is already behind bitcoin, so it's unlikely that some new fork will take over, especially not one that's devalues existing coins by raising the coin cap.  This has been demonstrated over and over again with altcoins - it's very hard to build the network effect and get anywhere near the value of bitcoin.

Here are some details about proof-of-reserves: 
There is an implementation on Git-Hub here: 
Regarding "provable fairness", this is the idea that if I'm running a casino, I can prove to you that my randomness is truely random.  Ie, I didn't cheat and give you bad dice rolls when you bet big, and good dice rolls when you bet small.
I'll give you a simple example.  Lets say me and you want to do a fair coin toss.  I'll generate a secret 256 bits of entropy, lets called that s.  Then I send you the hash of that secret, lets call it h.
h = SHA256(s).
I know *s* and *h*, you know only know *h*.
Now, you generate your own 256 bits of entropy, called *t*.  It can be any number of your choosing.  Then you send your *t* value to me.
Now I reveal *s* to you, and we can both calculate our coin toss by concatenating *s* and *t*.
result = SHA256(s + t).
If the result is even, we'll call it heads.  If it was odd, we'll call it tails.
Because of the properties of cryptographic hash functions, you can be sure that I didn't cheat.  Of course, this doesn't guarantee I'll pay up for losing the bet, but that's where reputation comes into it.  If your site doesn't process withdrawals, then it won't last long.

You're reading way too much into it.  They said only one word, "Yes".  The article gives now detail on the context, the exact question, and who answered it on what authority.  The most logical interpretation of this is they are saying that accepting payment in bitcoin doesn't exempt you from owing GST on the sale.
Also note that the ATO doesn't set tax law with their utterances.  They have to interpret the existing law just like anyone else, and courts will settle any disagreements.

I suppose that's why there's about $10 billion worth of CC fraud every year?  That's a big part of why CC fees are so high.  Do you really want to see bitcoin transactions incur a 3% fee to cover those "not many" people who fraud the system?
With credit cards you at least have to steal someone's card to do fraud.  With bitcoin, you could just install a wallet that doublespends your coin, and it has been demonstrated you can have a pretty decent chance of pulling it off even with the current p2p relaying "protections" in place.
We want bitcoin to be *zero fee* for transactions.  We want to have *no fraud* or at least very low fraud.  The instant confirmation BIP allows us to achieve this.

Still, I'm quite surprised that they are charging such a high fee per repetition.  You literally end up paying 1.5 mBTC for a 3 repetition coinjoin, which is 15 times the standard fee per kilobyte.  They must be profiting lots off of this service.

I like blockr.  Everytime I run into a bug on blockchain.info, I head over to blockr and they don't have the same bug.  For instance, the other day I sent a transaction from a P2SH address, and it didn't show up on blockchain.info, but blockr had it.  Blockchain.info also has problems with showing transactions as unconfirmed even though they have confirms, which happens if it gets first confirmed into an orphan block.

It sounds like you didn't really figure out how mining works.
There is nothing in the bitcoin protocol that makes mining difficulty rise over time, despite what news articles might tell you.  Mining difficulty exists to regulate the rate of block production to one block every 10 minutes.  If the blocks are being produced faster than that, difficulty rises to bring back the average time of block production to 10 minutes.  If blocks are coming too slow, mining difficulty goes down.  The fact that mining difficulty has historically risen over time represents two things:
- Improvements in mining technology (first it was CPUs, then GPUs, now it's ASICs and the chips continue to become faster and more efficient each generation).
- Increased investment in mining operations:  No matter how much is invested in mining, there is always a fixed amount of coins to be mined, so the more that gets invested just pushes up the cost of production for making blocks.
People often make the mistake of thinking that increasing mining difficulty causes miners to have to invest more to find blocks.  That's backwards - it's actually *because* miners choose to invest more in their operations that difficulty keeps growing.
Also, you're completely overlooking that Bitcoin is a currency.  The generation of coins (mining) is just the process of their creation - but then they can circulate forever and be used in infinitely many transactions.  It's their ability to transact instantly, trustlessly and securely that makes them useful and valuable.

I don't think QR codes will have much of a role to play in the future of payments. They are ugly and clunky. Something like NFC would be an easier way to obtain the payment request. The bartender just needs an indicator that payment has been made (eg. Some display on the register or some other device). Although personally I doubt that bitcoin will ever have widespread usage as payment for drinks since the transaction fees would be too high.  If anything there might be some off-blockchain debit card style system that operates similar to paywave.

I feel that a sudden tipping point could potentially be a bad thing.  Imagine if this did happen, walmart accepted it, convinced their suppliers to accept it, and got their customers on board.  Suddenly the bitcoin transaction rate has increased several hundred percent, we're paying 0.001 BTC fees to get into a block, and the BTC price is $5000.  That means a $5 fee per transaction.  Things would hit a brick wall and Walmart would have to turn around and change course.

If you run bitcoin-qt, you're running a fully validating node and you're trusting *no one*.
If you run your own lightweight wallet (eg. electrum) then you're using SPV verification which has a different security model but is still pretty darn trustless.  In any case, your wallet is the only one who knows the key, so no one can ever steal your coins or stop you from transacting if you securely generate your own address.

True.  My main point is that it's such a simple concept, and yet mainstream economics argues the opposite.  They say inflation boosts consumption, and deflation hurts consumption.

Bitcoin has a lot of similarities with gold, but there are some important differences:
- Bitcoin is algorithmically limited with a hard cap.  Gold is naturally limited to what we can physically discover and retrieve.  Both are forms of "sound money" and should be bought as a hedge against inflation / central banks.
- Bitcoin can be sent across the globe instantly.  It moves seamlessly across borders.  Gold must be physically transported and therefore is less useful as a transactional currency (eg. buying goods online), and is harder to move between borders undetected.
- Any amount of bitcoin can be stored at basically zero cost.  Like gold, if you take posession of it and secure it properly, no one can steal it or confiscate it.
- Bitcoin is a nascent technology.  Gold's store of value has been solidified over many millenia.  Bitcoin is still highly speculative at the moment, although it's hard to imagine that cryptocurrency will ever go away now that it has been invented.
Disclosure:  I own both gold and bitcoin.

OK.  I just want to make 1 more point about deflation.
Many people look at deflationary episodes in the past (eg. the great depression), and they use it to label deflation as a bad thing that hurts an economy.
I completely acknowledge that for a highly-leveraged economy, deflation is a disaster.  That's because businesses and consumers have to devote a higher percentage of their falling income towards servicing debt (because debts are fixed nominally, the "real" amount owing increases), and this means less discretionary income to consumers, and less operating cash for businesses.  Today, we find ourselves in a grossly leveraged economy because central banks all over the world are pushing mountains of debt on everyone.  And governments are hugely in debt.  So it's no wonder that they fear deflation and will fight it off at all costs.
But what I'm saying is that deflation, the mere fact of falling prices, is not actually a dangerous phenomena, in fact it is very beneficial to consumers who have no debt, because they can afford to consume more with their money, and as I have argued, contrary to conventional belief, they *will* spend more, because they can.  Since bitcoin is equity-based, there is virtually no BTC-denominated debt right now, and I don't believe it will *ever* be possible to reach the level of leverage we have in the paper economy, because BTC interest rates **cannot** be manipulated, so debt will always be priced freely according to risk and reward.
I think in years to come people will start to recognise there are two economies - one legacy economy, full of debt, austerity, tax and no growth.  Then the crypto economy, booming with growth, no tax, no regulation, and total free market pricing, and low friction.  As economic activity shifts into the crypto economy, government tax revenues will decline, and this will force governments to tax even harder on whatever remaining legacy economic activity they control.  There will reach a tipping point where the paper currency system rapidly collapses under its own weight.

Yeah, the "ACH" analogy sounds like what I'm talking about, but without any form of central clearing house.  Instead, it would be point-to-point, bi-lateral agreements.  If there were a standard protocol for this then that would help things along, but to start it off there could just be ad-hoc integrations done between 2 major players like coinbase/bitpay to get the ball rolling.
The site you linked isn't really what I was thinking, because that only solves the zero-confirmation trust issue, but still results in a blockchain transaction for each payment/transfer, hence still requires a blockchain fee on every payment which I don't believe will scale in the future.  With the off-blockchain method, any number of transactions can occur between the 2 parties off-blockchain, and the difference is settled via a single blockchain transaction.

The contrarian logic is that if everyone is super bullish, they are likely to be "all in" rather than waiting on the sidelines for cheaper buying, which would mean there's not much strong buying support left.  Generally you should buy when people are capitulating, and sell when it's euphoric.  56% of people convinced we're going 10x higher this year is euphoric to say the least.

I don't agree because rich people own assets, they don't sit on depreciating cash.  A rich person puts their wealth in stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets, or they own private businesses, and these assets automatically keep pace with inflation.
Bitcoin isn't debt-based like the fiat money system.  There is little to no "debt" in bitcoin at the moment, except for a few dodgy loans that occur on bitcointalk, and since these loans are done pseudonymously there is a high default rate and so the creditors take on a lot more risk.   But basically debt doesn't exist in BTC at all compared to the scale of debt in the legacy monetary system.
Under deflation, the rich person's assets are actually depreciating (stock prices fall, house prices drop, business revenues decline), and the poor person's wages gain purchasing power.  The onus is on the rich people to try to push p ay cuts rather than the poor having to fight for pay rises.

Metcalf's law says that the value of a communications network grows with the square of the number of users, because when a new user joins, it makes the network more useful for all existing users.

Due to endless QE and uncontrollable US debt, countries continue to move away from dollar-denominated trade into their own currencies.  Key markets like oil move to euro/rmb/dinar or something else.  Countries also continue to diversify their forex reserves to reduce their exposure to USD.  This trend results in an increasing amount of dollars returning to the united states and thus inflation kicks in and the dollar begins to lose over 10% value per year, which accelerates and ultimately ends the era of USD as global reserve currency.
The fall of USD destabilises all other fiat currencies as people seek safety in hard assets.
Some alternative springs up that is gold-backed or somehow commodity backed.  In order to stabilise their currencies, other nations back their own currency by this commodity-backed currency.  The world moves onto a new non-fiat global reserve system.

That's not really how they are supposed to be used.  For that type of transaction, the seller should just give you a unique address to pay to, and they will know it's you who paid them.  If you need further proof of payment, then the Payment Protocol (BIP 70) is perfect for this as it will provide signed proof of the payment.
Coloured coins are more intended to exploit the fact that coins can be traced through the blockchain.  So by "colouring" a coin, you can always identify and prove its colour by tracing back the links in the blockchain to its genesis transaction.  This makes it really easy to do things like smart property / shares etc which can be traded in a decentralised way.

If it's anything like the companies I've worked for, staff will tend to fluctuate between spending time that's not profitable (eg. spending a long time helping a small customer with a support case which isn't charged by the hour, or spending ages in meetings where you go over task lists and update with "yeah i haven't got to that yet") vs doing things that are insanely profitable (like getting a job done in 45 mins that earns $1K, or building some new product that earn tons of revenue).  Then it hopefully averages out to be profitable overall.  The bitcoin hackathon most likely caused additional productivity that wouldn't have necessarily occurred if they were working on other wasteful everyday tasks, or standing around chatting in the kitchen.

I wonder whether people making these predictions have really dug deep enough to understand the issues facing blockchain scalability and mining?  If we have $100k bitcoin, then, the block reward is $2.5M per block.  Do you think any mining pool is going to want to bloat their blocks with transactions to get an extra few hundred dollars, and risking $2.5M due to propogation delays orphaning their block?  Nope, any sensible mining pool would be creating empty blocks, and only including transactions that have ridiculously high fees, like $500 per transaction or something.
Either they see this problem being resolved somehow, or they're just ignorant of it.

Back then, there were threads almost daily about giving profits to Seans Outpost.  People who got tipped would forward them to Seans Outpost.  And that's another thing - they also received lots of money via the bitcointip bot which wouldn't have shown up on the blockchain against their donation address.

From what I understand of trezor, it uses deterministic signatures so there is no risk of RNG problems leaking the key.  It also uses a combination of its own entropy, and user-sourced entropy, to create the seed.  It's also done in a provable way so that you you can be sure it's used the entropy you provided.  So, theoretically you could develop some software to seed Trezor with dice rolls and confirm it was used by the device.

You're mistaken in quite a few ways.  The fed wasn't originally created to fund the government.  The government funds itself through private investors (banks, other sovereigns, etc) who lend to them and expect to be paid back with interest.  Only in recent years has the fed started manipulating the price of bonds buy purchasing them in secondary markets off of the original holders.   The interest paid on bonds is not designed to cover the cost of money printing, it exists to pay interest to the bond holder to give them a reason to lend to the government.  You don't lend someone money unless you get interest back.  Interest rates are set according to the risk of the loan.  But now that we have the fed providing virtually unlimited demand for treasuries, this forces interest rates down to 0 (there is basically 0 risk that you won't get your nominal amount back, because the fed will effectively print the cash to buy it off you).
You're also falling victim to the fallacy that it's impossible to pay off all debt if its greater than the amount of money in circulation.  Let me give you an example of why it's possible:  I create a new currency, but I only create 100 units of it.  I lend you these 100 units to you on condition that you pay me back 110 (10% interest).  Now you owe 110 units but there are only 100 in existance, so you might say this is impossible to pay off.  But, it's not.  You start paying me back 10 units per month, and after the 10th month, I have 100 units, you have 0, and you still owe me 10 units.  Now, I say to you, go paint my fence, and I'll pay you 10 units.  So you paint it, I pay you 10 units, and you use the pay to pay of the loan.  Do you see what happened here?  It's not fair.  I reaped the benefits of your labour, simply because I control the money supply.  This is how the banking system works.  All debt CAN be paid off, but we'll be working and saving for decades to do it.

I think there is a difference.  With bitcoin, if I send you some BTC, you receive it and the deal is done.  With coloured coins, if I send you some token representing a car, then after you receive it there is still some obligation for me to supply you with the car, otherwise you've just got a useless token.  This additional clearing mechanism adds a much greater layer of trust.  And then you have to wonder, if all the value is in the actual car, not the token, and we will be transferring the car, then why have the token involved at all?  The car can be represented by... the car.
I can see how it would make sense for non-physical things though, like company shares.  If you own a share, the company can pay BTC dividends directly to the address holding the share.  So long as the company continues to pay out dividends, the coloured shares will have fundamental value in and of themselves.

OK the raw transaction is: 010000000353179e0e3d0b4ee294690c80a62bcd0742b258fda67e5d35e4f6fccde5af2adeaa00000000ffffffff03d9c94f9b674d35fdbf50d2ae4f1f5e92eb041764b4714a7d151456f37d1ccb3200000000ffffffffed4279a69dc24686522173f4fa3c5205fad5359253d9a29e562513fcc9fe5ba00000000000ffffffff0160c9c100000000001976a914a5027453698d7aa4ea303ac7737ef3e5a88fd72488ac00000000
So, to sign it, you need to go to the RPC console (same place you got the raw transaction) and type:
`signrawtransaction 010000000353179e0e3d0b4ee294690c80a62bcd0742b258fda67e5d35e4f6fccde5af2adeaa00000000ffffffff03d9c94f9b674d35fdbf50d2ae4f1f5e92eb041764b4714a7d151456f37d1ccb3200000000ffffffffed4279a69dc24686522173f4fa3c5205fad5359253d9a29e562513fcc9fe5ba00000000000ffffffff0160c9c100000000001976a914a5027453698d7aa4ea303ac7737ef3e5a88fd72488ac00000000`
BTW, you should be really careful about signing transactions that people give you over the internet :P  I could just as easily have this tx pay to me instead of you.  You can decode it by using the decoderawtransaction call.  But, if you trust me, just go ahead and sign it and then paste back the result here.

That's not core bitcoin terminology, but it is a term used by deterministic wallets such as Electrum or the upcoming BIP32 standard.  If you're familiar with Electrum, you'll know that the "seed" is used to generate an infinite sequence of bitcoin private keys and therefore addresses.  The master public key can generate the same sequence but *only the public keys*.  So you can input the master public key into a wallet and have watch-only functionality.  You'll be able to see balances, generate new addresses, but will never be able to spend from them.

Regarding your question about add an exclamation mark: it's actually not possible because the seed is actually just the representation of a number in a really high base.  I'm not sure what the base is, but let's assume 1600 like you said.  So you can think of each word as a digit in a really high number base.  It doesn't make sense to modify those words because then they aren't valid digits and don't decode to numbers.
Electrum seeds are 128 bits.  If you were to encode that using all printable characters on your keyboard (say, 52 letters + 10 digits + 10 symbols) then it would be log72(2^128) = 20 characters long.  That's a password like:
which is uncrackable.
Key stretching just means the seed has undergone lots of rounds of hashing before being stored, so a cracker has to also do that many rounds of hashing on *every* attempt, which just slows down a brute force attempt by a constant factor.

You should be able to make it support non powers of 2, eg. 6-sided dice.  One method I'm thinking of is to generate a base X number.  So for 4 rolls of a 6-sided dice, X = 6.  Calculating the number rolled would be roll1 * 6^0 + roll2 * 6^1 + roll3 * 6^2 + roll4 * 6^3.  This gives you a number between 0 and 1297.  In onder to ensure uniformity, you have to throw away any numbers above the closest power of 2.  So if they rolled more than 1024, they unfortunately have to re-roll.  But if they roll between 0 and 1024, then you treat that as a random 10-bits of entropy.
Edit: was just testing some numbers, and some of them line up quite well.  12 rolls of a 6-sided die has a ~98.7% change of being between 0 and 2^31.

It could create some low-dimensional / low-precision representation which is consistent across readings.  Or, it could create a high-dimensional / high-resolution representation that is more fuzzy, and then do a local search to find the encryption key.  I'm just speculating here and making up ideas.  I agree that the whole thing sounds very questionable.  I don't think today's technology is good enough to get sufficient &amp; consistent entropy from a face.
edit:  I just realised it would be stupid anyway, because if your face is your encryption key, you're basically walking around all day showing everyone your key.  Someone would just have to steal your wallet and then photo your face to get the key.

Side chains are just a technical solution to scaling the blockchain and allowing experimentation with new blockchain technologies while keeping the core blockchain conservative and stable, all the while uniting the hash power over a single digitally scarce resource (bitcoins).
App coins are an end-user of the blockchain, and can exist either on the main chain or on a side chain. It doesn't matter from a user's perspective. They serve a use case where an app wants to issue its own digital tokens and leverage the blockchain for security and transaction processing.

Being online doesn't actually make any difference.  The address generation process doesn't involve any network communication.
The address space is 2^160.  Even if you were generating a trillion addresses per second, it would take apprximately 38,310,000,000 years (on average) to generate just a single collision (that's about 3 times the current age of the universe).  Note though, this would just be a collision between two of the empty addresses you generated, not a collision with an actual address used on the blockchain.
If you wanted to collide with an address that actually was used on the blockchain and had money on it, it's more like 46,310,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years (on average).  That's 3,400,000,000,000,000,000 times the current age of the universe.
This is all assuming that you're generating a trillion addresses per second.  In reality, you're not, you're maybe generating a few addresses per day.
In other words, spend your time worrying about something else :)

Interesting, it's a good idea to split the network into a kind of 'yin' and 'yang' to keep eachother in check.  However in this particular scenario I feel the system could be abused.  In point 4 you say that a block contains references to the mini-PoW's for the last block, and these function as shares to split a fixed payout amongst the miners.  It seems that whoever mines a block would naturally only include their own mini-PoW shares so that they get the max payout (or at least, include only enough PoW as required to beat any rival chain). There does not seem to be an incentive for block creators to include all mini-PoW in their blocks.

Game theory says this will never happen.  Miners want to include the highest fee-per-kilobyte transactions into their blocks to maximise their reward.  They don't care how much is being transacted since it makes no difference to them.
If anything, smaller transactions might have to pay more fees if the block reward scheme is ever changed to factor in bitcoin-days-destroyed in determining chain length.

My take from OP's question was that s/he was concerned about having the private key entered into an online machine, which immediately downgrades it from being offline-level security.  Any future coins stored at the address are can't really considered to be "cold storage" anymore.

I'll try to explain.  Debt is not a bad thing in and of itself, and we will definitely need systems for lending under bitcoin.  But the fiat money system has a debt problem which is far beyond normal and healthy.
If you take a look at a chart of global debt, it's exploding exponentially, while at the same time we have no real economic growth.  The massive levels of credit are putting a drag on spending.  The central banks have responded to this by lowering interest rates to encourage further borrowing and lessen the interest burden on debtors.  They are basically trying to solve a debt problem with more debt.  But at a certain point, even with interest rates near zero, the private sector just can't be enticed to go any further into debt.  So then the government steps in.  If people aren't spending, the Keynesians believe that the government needs to make up for it.  But the governments already have costs that exceed their income from tax, so in order to spend more into the economy they have to go further into debt.  In a free market, no one would lend to an insolvent institution, but under the fiat money system we have central banks that act as "lenders of last resort" and can lend to the government in unlimited quantities via money printing.  This keeps the governments going, public debt continues to grow exponentially, and yet still we see no growth.  Funny that - printing money doesn't seem to make us rich?
If the global economy was left untouched by central banks, there would be an epic deleveraging and a huge depression.  There's just so many natural forces trying to unwind debt.  But instead, we march on as a zombie economy, being kept alive by an intravenous credit line pumping into our veins.  Getting more drunk on credit and creating more asset bubbles, inefficient institutions, inflation, poverty and still no growth to show for it.
Under bitcoin, this type of circus just wouldn't be possible.  People would need to charge an appropriate level of interest on loans to cover their risk.  Lenders could only lend money they had.  Insolvent organisations would go out of business.  Credit bubbles would result in recessions (aka the business cycle, which was a normal part of economies until central banks decided to eradicate deflation).

Issue  Not really a fair comparison; transactions are basically instant for the reasons posted by others.
Issue  This is a "wait and see" issue that we won't understand until a couple of decades into the future when it begins to be a problem.  For at least the next 15 or so years, I believe the network will continue to be "oversecure" in the sense that there is probably too much reward for mining.  Once we start transitioning into low block subsidys, it will depend on network transaction volume, fees, and BTC price as for how adequately secure the network will be.  It's not an impossible problem to fix though - what if miners were crowd funded, or, as Gavin suggested, maybe miners in the future don't operate for profit, but instead there are mining chips everywhere, like in my heater to warm my house.
Isssue  I believe there are some big wins that can be done without compromising decentralisation, which should allow the network to grow to much greater transaction volumes than today.  There seems to be some movement in these areas already (eg. Gavin's tweet about constant block size using the invertible bloom filter).
Issue  This is disturbing and I hope we see mining pools get more fragmented in the future.  Various technical solutions have been discussed here.  It's probably one of the most difficult problems.  Hopefully we see something get implemented.
edit: Either way, Bitcoin is still fascinating and holds so much promise for the future.  To avoid it because of these perceived issues would be a real shame.  Get involved and start helping to solve them!  Some of the best Bitcoin contributors have also been skeptical about its problems.  Example:  Peter Todd sold half of his bitcoin stash because of the mining centralisation issue, but he still works tirelessly to try to solve that problem and others.

Miner's don't have special "veto" powers, they can choose to run whatever software they want, just like every bitcoin user.  It's just that they add security to whatever chain they choose to mine.  So if you, as a bitcoin user, choose to switch to a new hard fork, you get a new chain that complies with the new rules but has less security.  If you choose to remain on the most secure chain, then you live with the rules of that chain.  If the new hard fork is a valuable chain to you, then you can mine it and make money in that chain, at the same time adding security.
If users start valuing the new chain more, then miners have to switch to it if they want to keep mining valuable coins.

The blockchain is not scanned every time to find if a utxo exists.  There is an index in memory containing all the utxo's, which allows them to be checked in logarithmic time.  They are indexed by the transaction hash, as that is how they are referred in the TxIn.

Lets say I pick a random 128-bit number.  This will be my secret number that you have to guess.  I take that number and use it an AES key to encrypt a known 128-bit value, lets say 2^128-1.  I take the resulting ciphertext and xor it with my original secret number.  Then, I give you the result of that xor.  How are you going to reverse it to find my secret number?  Even though AES is reversible, and xor is reversible, you can't reverse this simple construct.  Real hash functions work in a similar way but they chain together these constructs for extra security (see Merkel-Damgard) and they also don't have to use a reversible block cipher like AES.

Do you mind sharing the tx IDs?  One of them may have been bigger in size.  If you look it up on blockchain.info, you'll see how many bytes they are.  Also, the age of the coins you're spending matters.  Perhaps the unconfirmed one was spending more recent coins.
Either way, you'll just have to wait it out and hopefully get a confirm soon.

That's a very cynical view.  Hard-coded fees were *always* a hack.  Having a floating fee market is a pre-requisite for moving forward with any scalability solution.  How could we understand the dynamic between users, miners, and block size, without actually having a floating market?  What would raising the block size achieve, if miners refuse to make larger blocks anyway?
Of course the developers want to scale the blockchain to high transaction rates whilst maintaining decentralisation.  It's not impossible to achieve - there have been many ideas discussed, like UTXO commitments and blockchain pruning.  This floating fee change is a step the right direction that will help those solutions move forward.

No, the coins can only be spent once, but they are being spent under a different transaction ID than the one gox transmitted.  Ie. someone is intercepting their unconfirmed transaction, altering it (whilst keeping the signature in tact) to form a new txid, then confirming the altered one into a block.  Gox checks to see if the txid they transmitted was confirmed, and they see that it failed (due to the inputs already being spent by the other tx) and so they mark the withdrawal as failed, giving the customer an opportunity to re-withdraw and repeat the process.  But actually the customer DID get the money via the mutated transaction.
As a result their wallet thinks it has some unspent outputs that are actually spent.  When it tries to spend these in future transactions, those ones fail and hence the withdrawal problems that people are getting.
The question is how much BTC has been stolen from gox through this exploit.  Hopefully not enough that they can't fulfill all withdrawals.

From the article:


One of the effects of treechains is that it separates validation from the proof-of-work blockchain building process.  So at the lowest level we can have everyone's hashing power securing the same data, and that data can contain any number of different interpretations of valid blockchains.  So something like Viacoin could benefit from the security provided by bitcoin miners, even if its not consensus-compatible.
That's my take on it... I might be wrong.

Gavin has already thought of this.  The fee estimation only bases its calculations on transactions that come into your mem pool.  So miners would have to broadcast those transactions to the network, which would risk paying the fees to someone else.
Edit:  Just checked the comment from sirk390 and mentioned that they could broadcast the transactions only after they find the block.  So the risk of someone else mining the tx would be minimal.  Interesting...

This IS the beauty of the unregulated free market.  Gox will fail.  There will be no secret deals from the Central Bank of Bitcoin to provide emergency liquidity while they fix the withdrawal problem.  We fail hard and fast here.
Sadly the pace of innovation for bitcoin exchanges is not what it could be, due to the fact that there are massive barriers to entry provided by the highly regulated non-bitcoin world.
If scams and failures are a problem then innovation will take care of that - we'll see trustless exchanges / banks emerge.  Bitcoin offers SO much room for further innovation.

I think that price differences would still exist between markets.  But there seems to be a long term trend (globalization) where prices in developing countries are coming closer to prices in developed countries.  For example, GDP has risen dramatically in developing countries over the last 10 years, but not much at all in developed nations.  It's no longer ridiculously cheap to travel to some countries like it used to be (although it's still cheap).  Bitcoin might help accelerate this process as it helps to break down borders between economies, but I think it will take a while before we start having global markets for everything.

Try BitGo: 
They apparently have an "advanced" signup method where you can generate your keys offline.  Otherwise, the default is that they are generated in your browser (client side only) on your online machine.  The server owns 1 of the 3 keys, and also has an encrypted copy of one of your keys, but doesn't know the passphrase.
If you're willing to consider a different model (2-of-2 multisig) then I recommend GreenAddress.    They pre-sign nLocktime transactions so that you can eventually recover your funds even if they disappear.  Personally I like that wallet because they only ever own 1 key, and don't even see an encrypted version of your one.  It's deterministic so you just need to write down your seed on paper.  They can do 2FA (inc. sms) approval of transactions.
I'd recommend keeping most of your funds in the offline electrum wallet though, and just using the multisig wallet as a hot wallet for everyday transactions.

What you're not understanding is orphan costs.  I haven't seen any evidence from your posts that you know what orphan costs are.  Here is some reading for you: 
No one is paying 3.2mbtc per kilobyte in fees, which is the current equilibrium fee according to gavin's rough estimates.  What this says is that pools who make smaller blocks will profit more and hence will attract more miners.  Incidentally, the larger pools face less orphan costs, so can in turn tolerate a lower fee threshold and enjoy the same profits.
All of this, to me, suggests that blocks will continue to remain small (and hence TPS low), and pools will continue to prioritise by fee-per-kilobyte.  Your proposal is basically a charity system where the miners forgo profits for the users' benefit, and my whole point is that pools won't work like that.  The pools that get the miners are the ones with the highest payouts.  Charity pools will shrink away into insignificance.

Same reason why we see pools at 45% which has gone well beyond jeopardising bitcoin into full blown feasible attack territory, yet people still don't move out of the pool.
People will always act to maximise their own benefit.  Any shared global problems are less important to an individual because we only carry a fraction of the responsibility each.  We would rather continue to be selfish and leave the problem to someone else to deal with.

A bitcoin address is the hash of a public key, combined with a checksum, converted into Base58Check encoding.
An address can be derived from a public key, but the public key cannot be derived from a bitcoin address due to the one-way nature of hash functions.

Isn't it still trivial to trace?  Because if you see a 10BTC input, a 5.1153BTC output going into another CoinJoin, and 4.8847 going to change (non-coinjoin), then you can associate the 5.1153BTC with the 10BTC input.  Then it's easy to trace it through the repetitions because its output will always be the one with 5.1153 minus the 0.5mbtc fee per reptition.

This wouldn't change anything since every transaction would have an expected value of fees.  Expected value = probability of fee * fee amount.  Miners will just prioritise based on that value instead, which means nothing would change in terms of miners blocks, but the users would have added uncertainty over what their transaction ends up being.

Yep, and I'm quite convinced that the off-market volume has been much higher than the exchange volume since the start of the year.  If it requires temporarily moving 4K coins onto stamp to hold the price down, its worth it to save that money on a 30K off-market purchase.  Hence why the stamp order book now has 16K coins for sale when it had 11K a couple of days ago.
SecondMarket has already acquired 80K coins off-market.  Pantera Capital perhaps the same.  Private investors doing the same.  The price will stay low until the early adopters are milked of all their coins through private deals, then it'll go higher.  The early adopters go along with it, because it's the safe way to to extract 10s of millions of dollars for their coins.  Trying to do that through a dodgy eastern european exchange poses enormous risks, and then if you eventually receive your wire transfer, your bank would likely freeze the funds and investigate you.  Private wall street contracts with firms that are already 'in' the banking game is a far safer way to cash out.

Proof of stake is not some silver bullet solution that would give us a decentralised currency without mining.  The principal issue is the "nothing at stake" problem, which requires very complex schemes to try to solve, and there needs to be far more research into this area to determine whether it's possible to achieve the level of decentralisation and security of Satoshi's blockchain.  Currently all proof-of-stake coins are dependent on checkpoints for security (checkpoints are a centralized way of asserting consensus on "this is the true blockchain").  Bitcoin only uses checkpoints to speed up syncing, but it works perfectly fine without them.  There is no known solution to make proof-of-stake work, given that anyone can fork from the genesis block and construct their own equal-length chains at little to no cost.  And miners can mine on any number of forks simultaneously, which removes the natural incentive for the network to converge on a single chain.

Bitcoins have to come into existance somehow, otherwise none would exist.  Eventually there will be 21 million in circulation, but as of today there have only been ~12.3 million mined so far.
Distributing the coins to the people who mine blocks is a fair way to issue coins in a decentralised system.  This is fairer than, say, someone having the power to create them and issue them to their friends.
It also acts as a nice incentive for people to mine.  This is good for bitcoin, because the more that people invest in mining, the more expensive it becomes for an attacker to mess with the bitcoin network.

Pretty simple really.  Just create a transaction, sign it, and don't broadcast it.  Put the signed transaction in the software and let the software broadcast it when it's activated.
There's lots of code around for creating / signing raw transactions.  You could use bitcoin-core's RPC api, or BitPay's bitcore library.
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:17:36
That's a good question.  Bitcoin consensus is not formed based on number of users (because anyone create millions of bots to appear like users).  Instead it is based on computation.. because you can't fake that you have computing power.  It uses a "proof of work" algorithm for mining, which proves that you used a certain amount of computation to build a block.  Mining a block is the only way to make new bitcoins. Blocks are very easy for everyone to verify once they are mined, but very hard to initially mine them.  The amount of computation required to mine a block is adjusted dynamically by the network so that they come at an average rate of 1 every 10 minutes.  Hence there are currently 25 new bitcoins mined roughly every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:37:38
Exhaustive search is not possible no matter which approach you take (brute forcing the ECDSA key from the public key vs brute forcing a hash collision).  A real attack would have to involve weakening the crypto through some mathematical breakthrough.  It's absurd to even compare the two in terms of search space.

Not fully.  You don't win a reward as soon as you find a proof of work.  You have to propagate that block to the rest of the network, have it accepted by others, and have the main chain continue on top of it, then you're paid.  Block rewards aren't spendable until after 100 blocks for this reason, because there's a chance that your block can be orphaned after you mine it due to a network re-orgnasation (someone releases a longer competing chain which orphans your block).  Also in step 1, the block header also contains a merkle root which contains all transactions in the block including the reward payment to the address of your choice.
And the key to the last step is that the other miners need to accept the block and begin building a block on top of it (your block becomes their new previous block).  It's possible that someone could have found a block at the same time as you, so you might have half the network mining on top of yours and half mining on top of the other.  That will be resolved when one of the halves finds the next block and produces a new longest chain, then the other half will switch and orphan the other block.

You don't need an internet connection to generate a keypair and hence bitcoin address (an address is the hash of your pub key).  The address generation process uses randomness as input to ensure your address is unique (with high probability).  Anyone can send coins to that address - the blockchain doesn't care who generated it or whether or not anyone possesses the private key, it just marks the coins as belonging to that address.  Later, if you want to spend those coins, you'd need to use your private key to sign a transaction.  You broadcast the transaction which gets added to the blockchain to move the coins to some other address.
Brute forcing unspent outputs?  Forget about it.  The space is too large.  You're infinitely better off using that computational power on mining - it'll actually pay you something.  Attempting to brute force addresses is futile so will earn you nothing.
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:26:49
Whether it's a single laptop, "warehouse", or the whole planet doing it, makes very little difference relative to how difficult it would be to find even a single spendable output.  I don't think you fully understand the odds.
But either way, if it happened, it wouldn't crash the blockchain or the market.  It just means that someone would get their coins stolen, and they would wonder how it happened.  They would probably have to assume someone somehow hacked them.  It's not even a scenario worth entertaining though since there's not even a single known collision for even SHA-1 let alone SHA-256 (for ANY input, not just bitcoin keys).

Sorry, but you clearly don't know what a hard fork is.  Please go read up on the topic before commenting any further.
It has nothing to do with forking the source code.  It's to do with consensus on block validation.  There is no wiggle room in the definition of a hard fork - it's not a fuzzy concept to be debated.  A change is either a hard fork, or it's not.  Raising block size is a hard fork.  According to the side chain devs, they think they can introduce side chains as a soft fork, but we'll have to wait and see once the code is written.

Bitcoin is a currency. You can use it for anything you would use other currencies for, eg. Spending, saving, investing, etc.
To use digital currency you need a digital wallet. That's just software that is used to store the money and transact with it.
Changetip is a third party tipping service with a reddit tip bot. People mention its name in tips so that it can recognise the tip and process it.
For getting started with wallets, I would recommend installing one on your phone like Android Wallet or Breadwallet, then try withdrawing your tips out of changetip and into your own wallet. Then try using that wallet to buy something online or make a donation to a charity.

The biggest barrier to adoption right now is the onramp and offramps.  If these highly-regulated but easy-to-use onramps bring a 10x growth to the user base, then I think it's a good thing.  Once people are in the system, they'll eventually learn their way around it and start to branch out.
I liken it to bittorrent and downloading free movies / tv shows.  Everyone does it now and it's normal.  Mass adoption of peer-to-peer file sharing forced the industry to be disrupted.  But that only became commonplace after everyone had a computer on their desk and became familiar with software and the internet.

When you restore your wallet.dat from the flashdrive, you would be able to see any changes to your balance for any addresses that were in the wallet (ie. all addresses you've used up until the point of backup + the next 100 which are in the keypool).  The wallet contains a record of the last block that it has processed, so it can rescan the blockchain from the right starting point next time it's loaded up.
But as everyone else said, there's gotchas, so you're best to use a deterministic wallet if you want to be able to use it on multiple devices.

@_date: 2014-02-12 13:22:26
The most obvious difference is that central banks are the ones who issue their currency, whereas the bitcoin developers do not and cannot issue bitcoins.  Bitcoins can only be mined, and mining can be done by anyone.
The supply of bitcoins is known in advance.  Unlike a central bank, no one can manipulate the money supply.
Another power that central banks often possess is the ability to manipulate interest rates.  By setting the risk-free rate of return, this indirectly effects the value of all other assets in the economy.  In bitcoin there is no interest rates and no one has any more power than anyone else, developers included.  All prices are determined by the free market.
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:06:40
Unfortunately, no.  The bitcoin network doesn't actually observe or police any hashing activity.  All we see are completed blocks.  We can infer from looking at these blocks, that there must be X hashes per second of mining power in order to produce those blocks, but it's only a best estimate, and we have no idea who, what, or where this hashing is coming from.
For any block an honest solo miner produces, an attacker with more hash power can produce the exact same block faster, and with any alterations of their choice.  And even if some nodes are online to observe the time at which these blocks were first broadcast, it is impossible to prove which block came first to another node who arrives later.  The only form of consensus is trusting the longest proof-of-work chain, and so long as an attacker commands more than 50% of hash power, they are in control of that chain.

Edit: just an idea: maybe since it's sci fi, it could be in a future where bitcoin is a universal standard, so prices are quoted in satoshis.  The in-game currency could be counted and priced in satoshis but perhaps there is the occasional mention of 100M satoshis being 1 bitcoin.

There is no way to have a proven consensus on who owns PoS coins, without checkpoints.
Example:  I could fork a PoS coin from the genesis block, mine every coin in existence, a produce an equal length chain.  Thousands of other people could do the same. There's no way, and no incentive, for people to reach consensus on a common chain, except for having checkpoints to prove it.
Checkpoints are just a centralized way of forming consensus.  It's the developers putting a stamp on the blockchain and saying "this is the real one".

You just need to find some way to get the unsigned transaction and input info over to the offline comp.  So you could run the mktx command on the online machine, then copy that text into a txt file and put it on a USB so that you can use it on the offline machine.
Then you run the signing command on the offline comp, then again copy its output (the signed transaction) back to the online machine for sending to the bitcoin network.

What I "heard"?  I find that insulting that you're accusing me of working on heresay.  I work with primary sources, FACTS, and form my own opinions, thank you very much.
The facts are that the top 3 pools have consistently had over 50% of hashing power, and GHash.io has been allowed to get to 45%.  This to me says that miners don't give a fuck about centralisation.  They would rather it be someone elses problem than to take action and sacrifice a small amount of variance.
Given these facts, I find it very difficult to believe that there could be some sudden and co-ordinated action by miners to switch to a shorter chain and reverse a double spend.  Most likely they would sit on their asses and wait for someone else to deal with it.

Each new merchant adds to stability because they introduce more liquidity to bitcoin.  Bitcoin's exchange rate is so volatile because something as small as a $10M movement into/out of BTC will have a noticeable effect on the price.  If we merchants keep "accepting bitcoin" this will add to BTC/USD liquidity (due to the resulting conversion to fiat), which has the effect of reducing volatility.

That's the whole point of the system.  A pool can't grow its outsourced hashing power without also growing its internal signing capacity.  By tweaking Y, we can adjust how much external hashing power a pool can utilise.  If the pool grows past this limit, it won't be able to sign all the blocks found by its miners, rendering the excess hash rate useless.
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:31:42


So, basically you show absolutely no remorse for having breached the 50% barrier, and don't think you did anything wrong?  You don't think pools should have to limit their hash rate for the sake of preserving one of the core properties of Bitcoin; decentralisation?


You did.  You already went to 51% hash rate, and that in itself can be considered an attack on Bitcoin's fundamental property of decentralisation.  You show absolutely no respect for our currency.

@_date: 2014-03-21 02:06:07
Maybe they think it's somehow reducing their orphan costs?  As far as I understand, each layer added to the merkle tree would double the hashing required to compute the root of the tree, so a merkle tree with 256 transactions would require half the computation of one with 257, so adding that 1 additional transaction would double the amortised cost per transaction for validating the tree.  That hashing gets done by every bitcoin node and is performed by CPUs, so maybe they've got the idea that it's not worth the propgation delays?  I doubt it makes any significant difference though..

Oh exactly, I agree that SHA256 is a one-way function, but XOR does not share the same property.  The important property of hash functions is, given an output value, it's difficulty to produce an input value that will result in that output value.
eg.  Given Y, such that H(X) = Y, I cannot find X.
That makes it a secure hash function.
However, with xor, that's not the case.  Given Y, such that XOR(A,B) = Y, I can easily find A and B which produce the same output.  XOR(Y, 0) = Y for all Y.  Therefore xor is not a one-way function.

There are many different node / wallet implementations and they all release updates according to their own schedules.  They are all open source as far as I know (who would bother trusting a your money with closed source software?).
Updates to Bitcoin software happen frequently.  The thing that's harder to upgrade are the core consensus rules (the rules which decide whether a block is valid or not).  However, changes to those rules have happened in the past and will almost certainly happen in the future.  It can either happen in the form of a [soft fork]( or [hard fork](  Consensus is a big deal because we all need to agree on the state of the ledger.
As the network becomes more heterogeneous (both in terms of node implementations and peer-to-peer communication channels), the network becomes more robust and the potential impact of a really bad bug is more limited.  At the moment, I think over 90% of full nodes are running the Bitcoin Core reference client ( so if there were a serious bug in that software then it could have quite an affect - but there have been bad bugs before and the network has recovered.  The network has been in production for many years now and the blockchain is yet to be broken :)

I'm not completely sure but I think Trezor might feature plausible deniability which means you can give an alternate key which unlocks a different wallet, and you can have a small number of coins in there to make it look legit.
But if you're really worried about that stuff, you might be better off using paper wallets and having your keys stored in multiple secure locations, and requiring them all to be combined to retrieve your coins from cold storage.  In that case a thief would have to drag you through multiple safe deposit box facilities which seems unrealistic.  I think there are some wallets like Armory that can help you do that kind of thing.

It could be made so they can't cheat it though.  For example, each user could have a secret "proof identifier" which is given to them by the exchange for verifying that their balance is included in the total. It could be a concatenation of their username with a random 128-bit hex string. Eg. "platypii:c97308a497261548efa8547c43fee06e". Every day, the exchange had to publish a complete list of the *hashes* of these identifiers along with their balances.  This ensures that people usernames are hidden from the public.  Any user can hash their secret and confirm that the list contains their entry.  If the exchange tried to cheat by removing some coins from the list, it would only take 1 user to see that their entry isn't there.
The tricky bit would be making it so that people can't "cry wolf" and claim their balance isn't listed when it is. This might be possible using some extension of this scheme, maybe involving prime number generator groups or whatever wacky maths the crypto people use for stuff like that.

Some other markets bitcoin could take off in:
- Unbanked (2/3rds of the world's population)

Those are prime targets for optimisation which will make the network more efficient and robust, and those types of fixes are far more easily implemented than changing the block size since they don't require any forking.  Again, in the comments from the skeptics, this was one of the key points - we need full blocks to create a real driver for doing that kind of important work.

Ok that's fair.
I prefer using foldapp for a few reasons:
A) I get to do 2 blockchain transactions instead of 1 (I'm sentimental about that stuff).
B) The payment experience is better. Bitcoin POS process is kludgy, buggy and very slow.
C) The only bitcoin-accepting cafes I know get almost zero business from bitcoiners. I was supporting them for months while the numbers dropped off week after week and now they have only a few transactions per week. I think it's dead in the water. I'm going to move on to supporting new business models such as foldapp because they have a chance at being a killer app.
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:58:20
Yeah, if you think about it, we do ~90K transactions per day at the moment.  Almost all of those have at least 2 outputs (a payment output and a change output) and they are usually always to new addresses.  Then some transactions have a huge number of outputs.  So it makes sense that there would average around 2.2 unique outputs per tx.

Because if the price doesn't go up, security doesn't go up.  If the ledger is relied on more and more without security increasing, then risk goes up more and more.  It's like the dangling carrot gets bigger and bigger until someone decides to invest the money to 51% attack it.  At some point, people will either realise the risk and back down from using the blockchain, or they will invest in things that drive adoption and increase price / security.

Thanks. I'll look into independent reserve. I find this a little cheeky on their site though: "Funds are converted into USD at a rate that is typically 2-3 % better than the buy rate offered by major Australian banks." That probably means ~3-6% forex spreads, because banks are terrible, usually around 10% spread.

I think you are confusing the block reward payout as belonging to some particular node that announces it.  It doesn't matter who or where announces it; the most important thing for the miner is that the rest of the network hears about it as fast as possible so that it will be accepted by the rest of the network and built on top of.  If their block is slow to propagate, then someone else might come up with a competing block at the same height, and "orphan" their block.
The owner of the block reward is already baked into the block template before the miners start doing any proof of work on it.  The miner could change this prior to doing their hashing, but then they're not generating PoW for the pool, they are solo mining.  Solo mining is fine but you're going to need a very high hash rate to ever find a block.  People mine in pools so that they can reduce the variance by getting paid out in small increments for their work, with the pool taking on the variance.
The mining pool will know if its miner is working for the pool of cheating by changing the payout address, because miners have to submit partial proofs of work back to the pool regularly.  That is how the pool knows what hash rate the miner is working at.  You can't cheat it, because that's where the whole "proof" part comes in :)

Transactions consists of inputs (TxIns) and outputs (TxOuts).  A TxIn has the following fields:

You'd have to bundle a different transaction with each copy of the software.  Fees are part of the transaction, so just include your desired fees when you're making them.

As I said, they have &gt;50%.  The non-ghash mining minority can not outpace them in the long run.  If GHash wants to reverse 6 confirmations, they just build a private chain until they inevitably get 1 block ahead of the main chain, then release it.  They will always eventually end up 1 block ahead with 100% certainty.  49% cannot outpace them, just like a gambler will always lose if they bet for long enough.  Look up "gambler's ruin".

Sweeping is generally used to describe a process where you input a private key, and all of the funds on the corresponding address are transferred (or "swept") into your wallet, but the private key is *not* imported into your wallet.
Importing a priv key into your wallet is dangerous, because it could cause you to use that address later for receiving funds or change, which could cause you to lose money if the imported key is compromised.  Best to just sweep the priv key and never use it again.
Also if you're using a deterministic wallet, then sweeping makes sense because you want to get funds onto one of the deterministic addresses.
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:20:22
The block rewards are fixed, as you probably already know.  The amount of hashing to get those blocks is determined by network difficulty, which changes every 2 weeks and you can find current and historical figures for this online.  To do the conversion from difficulty into hashrate you can use this info:   Then you need to approximate the cost per hash, which is also a constantly changing thing because the price of electricity can change, plus the efficiency of the mining hardware is steadily improving.  You also have to factor in the capital expenditure to buy/produce the mining hardware.
If you can't be bothered working all that out, you could probably just approximate the cost as being roughly equal to the value of the bitcoins mined, due to the fact that any competitive industry should converge around marginal profitability.  So 3600 bitcoins per day = ~USD$2.1M per day.

ASICs won't hit up against moore's law until the technology fully matures. They have been rapidly jumping from 24nm, 16nm, 14nm etc and have been introducing liquid cooling and other tech.

You're not changing an address, you're creating multiple of them.  Think of it like you were creating a new email address each time you gave out your contact details, but you had an email client that checked and aggregated all of the mail for easy viewing (that's what your wallet does, it manages many addresses and presents you with your wallet balance which is the sum of them all).
The difference vs the email analogy is that everyone can see money arriving in your bitcoin addresses.  It's public information.  They don't know who you are though, they just see payments being made to addresses.  But only *you* can spend the money from those addresses because you have the private keys in your wallet that allow you to sign for it.
The username/password concept doesn't apply to bitcoin.  It's all about public/private keys.  So basically you generate an address which creates a key pair (a public key and private key), you then give out the public portion which allows people to send you money.  Once you receive money, you can later spend it by using your private key to sign for it.  The cool thing is that generating addresses is done in complete isolation with no need to contact the network to inform them of the address.  It's not like you have to "register" an address on some server somewhere.  You just randomly generate it, then give out the public part, and that's it.

Single address use is about privacy not security. So receiving multiple payments to an address is the bad part. It relates the two payments that may have otherwise remained unrelated. If you're doing ECDSA right, multiple signatures is perfectly fine. If you're doing ECDSA wrong, don't rely on 1 time use to keep you safe - it won't.

I think there are two questions. Can you use 1000 keys? No, limit of the checkmultisig operator is something like 20. Can you do boolean expressions ( key A and (key B or key C)) - yes but it would be a non standard script, meaning that normal nodes wouldn't relay it across the network, but if it's mined into a block then it's still valid.
Also look into threshold signatures which can do this kinda stuff without the blockchain needing to know. From the blockchain perspective it would look like a single signature, but to build the sig requires multiple keys.

You can use the bitcoin-core RPC interface to pull out transactions in JSON format.  I think the calls you want are getblock which will list all the transaction in a block, and then gettransaction which gives you the tx info.  You have to turn on the -txindex option though for the gettransaction calls to work.
It will be *very* slow to pull out all transactions though.  If you want to do it faster, you might need to find some code for parsing of the raw blockchain.
BTW, your single line format doesn't seem to cover the structure of transactions.  They can have multiple inputs (input tx hash + offset + scriptSig) and multiple outputs (scriptpubkey + amount)

If you double the amount of satoshis, then everything will cost twice the number of "half-satoshis" as satoshis, but that's still the same amount of BTC.  Prices never changed, just the units did.
Inflation occurs when you create more units of an existing currency out of thing air.  Eg. if you were to create new satoshis that never existed before, that's inflation, and that drives up prices.
Think of inflation as creating new money that steals its value from the existing money.  Thats not the case with a split, because all the owners of the currency all have their base units grown in equal proportion and we still value everything the same way.

Difficulty would only go up 20% if the hash rate grew by 20%, making cex's contribution even smaller. If they're 10% now, and are turning off next increase, then it'll definitely be less than 10% loss. So 10/9 = ~11% slower in the worst case. That's only 1 minute more on average.

To buy bitcoins outside the ETF can be seen as risky and requires you to do careful research.  You could have to do dodgy things like wire money internationally to exchanges that have a track record of failing.  Or, sending off your identity docs to some new company that you may or may not trust.
With the ETF, millions of users who are already set up to trade shares on the Nasdaq will be able to speculate on bitcoin with the click of a button.
The other thing is that investment funds have rules on what assets they can hold, and an ETF would allow them to allocate to some money into bitcoin whereas before they couldn't.

If it's already in one 20BTC output, then splitting it up on your trezor doesn't achieve much in terms of privacy, because they will all link back to the same original coins.  However, if it's in a hosted wallet like coinbase or an exchange, withdrawing chunks of 1 BTC at different times to different trezor addresses should separate the coins enough that someone can't tell how many you own when you spend them.
If they are in a single output, you could also deposit to a site like Satoshi Dice and then withdraw small chunks at a time.  Each withdrawal will likely come from completely different coins from their hot wallet.

I think banks would be amazingly well-positioned to start bitcoin exchanges, if they were willing to switch their stance and embrace bitcoin.

Seems like a no-brainer to me that a bank could launch an exchange that would be 10x better than anything else out there.

Great talk!  I don't fully grasp how tree chains would work - is there a white paper?
- What makes the lower levels of the tree lower difficulty?  Wouldn't merge mining allow you to mine all subchains at the same time?  Or, I suppose you would have to pick a specific branch of the tree according to what transactions you were going to include in the block?
- How is the block reward structured.  Does it change the 21 million rule to become a probabalistic limit or would the subsidies continue to follow the same deterministic rules?
- Would full nodes need to store the entire tree?  Could this cause spam/DoS by mining new blocks 256 levels deep for every transaction?  Would the tree system allow us to place an upper bound on blockchain growth (currently limited to MAX_BLOCK_SIZE every 10 minutes).
- What are the security implications?  So I still need to wait for my tx to be confirmed in the top level chain to get security equal to current bitcoin 1-confirmation security, but when its bubbling up the subchains do I get some new level of security between 0-conf and 1-conf?

The most important difference is not in storing the keys, but in the key generation and signing.
When it comes time to spend your paper wallet, you need to load that private key into some kind of device (eg. Computer, phone, table) and sign a transaction. At this stage, you have to worry about the security of that system. Is it compromised? Does it have a hacked/buggy RNG? Will it leak your keys through a side channel? The trezor does the signing securely on the device. The keys never leave it and never need to be loaded onto another device.
Likewise, your paper wallet is just a printout of a key. That key needed to be generated somehow. Most likely it was done on a computer. The same questions apply, was it compromised before you gen'd the address? Devices like Trezor or Mycelium Entropy provide a secure, isolated device for key generation.

Pfft, the malleability issue was just a catalyst that exposed the fact that gox has little to no accounting of their solvency.  If they were balancing their books in terms of customer deposits vs BTC reserves, the malleability exploit would have shown up as BTC leakage on their books and they would have noticed immediately when it started happening.  The fact that they aren't commenting on their solvency further suggests that they have no idea where they stand, and they're running around trying to make sense of the situation.  The malleability bug was just the tip of the iceberg that will sink the gox titanic.

Because bitcoin addresses are a 160-bit hash of the public key, it is a much smaller space than the 256-bit ecdsa key space.  To spend from a bitcoin address you don't need to find the exact keypair that was used to generate it, you just need to find *a* valid keypair.  On average there will be ~2^96 valid keypairs per bitcoin address.

Even if that is the case, the market cap of all coins need to be at least big enough to support the value of all transactions going through the network at any given point in time. You could calculate this number by estimating the total amount of daily commerce, then dividing by (50 * 21 million). I use the number 50 as the number of times each coins could be used in a transaction per day. This assumes an exchange will require 3 confirmations on a BTC deposit before allowing it to be exchanged for fiat. I'm not even including the additional hops the coins would take if they passed through a payment processor.
Next, you need a reasonable balance of coins to sit in the order books at exchanges in order to provide liquidity.
All this economic activity would all serve to provide a price floor.  Given a price floor, it is reasonable to assume that some people would choose to exploit this as a secure long term store of value, further adding to the market cap.
edit: Oh BTW, I question your premise here:


If people aren't holding bitcoins, the transactions are far from instant.  It takes days to purchase bitcoins using the legacy banking system.  If people want instant digital transfers, they'll need to keep a stash of crypto.

At current difficulty, the number of expected hashes to find a block is 188856850481284120576.

Why is everyone ignoring the issue of scalability? Millions of devices transacting in satoshis? This will not work with 1MB blocks, or even 20MB blocks if we ever get them.
@_date: 2015-05-11 21:46:36
Proof of work is just another name for the hashing work.  If you can produce an input to a hash function that results in a 32 zeros at the start, this proves that you must have tried 2^32 attempts ON AVERAGE to find that input.  If someone wants to *check* that I did the work, they only need to compute a single hash to see how many zeros are there.
A similar analogy, if I send you a video clip where I have 4 dice in my hand and I throw them fairly and they all land on 6, you can conclude that I must have tried ~1300 times on average to shoot that video, but you only need to watch 1 video to accept the proof that I did the work (ignore photoshopping in this analogy since there's no known way to cheat hash functions).
This process is essential to securing the blockchain.  Since it's a distributed ledger and an open network, anyone can try to write their own "fake" ledger which tries to change what happened in the past.  In order to prove which ledger is real, we accept the one that has the most computational work built into it.  Changing even a single byte of the blockchain would require re-doing all the computational work for every block that follows the change.  So this is why bitcoin is "trustless" because you can do some simple hash checks and confirm that the ledger was produced by millions of dollars worth of computing power and years of co-operation, so your node can easily find which chain to accept as the truth.  Anyone who wants to change the past will need to have more computing power than the rest of the network combined (a 51% attack).
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:49:56
I agree with Gavin here.
Trying to tune the blocksize to balance miner profitability with economic activity sounds like the closest thing to introducing central bank policy.  Miners going out of business and dumping coins? Shrink the block size. Economic activity suffering from too high fees? Increase the blocksize. I can just imagine people speculating on the next blocksize adjustment as to whether it will make coffee purchases feasible again and spur demand for coins.  It all sounds very un-bitcoin-like.
The only sane decentralized solution is to have an unlimited block size and let the free market regulate it.  That's what I think l Gavin is going for, with the upper limit just being a DoS prevention like the original 1MB cap was for.
BTW, I use bitcoin to buy coffee all the time. If I couldn't use it for that, I'd stop being such a fan. No I don't want to be forced off chain for those payments. What kind of ridiculous currency is so expensive to move that you have to rely on third party ledgers to account for it? Sounds like those giant stone currencies. Thankfully bitcoin is cheap to move - lets not make it artificially expensive because of some anticipated threat to security that doesn't exist yet.
Still, upvote for an interesting transcript.
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:22:09


It's not true.  No one runs a full node on their phone.  Most wallets use SPV and so they don't need to store any blocks.


Yes, but there are ways to do instant confirmations if you're willing to add a trusted third party.  There's even a post on the front page right now about doing this using micropayment channels.  Another approach is in a BIP proposed by Greenaddress which is an extension to the payment protocol for doing instant confirmations.  Even though those technologies aren't in widespread use yet, most merchants already accepting 0 confirmation transactions.  Especially point-of-sale transactions.  I've bought food, coffee, and beer with Bitcoin and have never had to wait for a confirmation when paying.
Regarding your third point, hard forks are possible.  We are going to have to hard fork to raise the 1MB block limit.  If there's a need to hard fork for security reasons, it can happen.  If an update is a soft fork or even just a patch that fixes security without changing the consensus rules, then it's even easier.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:11:02

There is no "main blockchain" in the way that you're thinking.  The blockchain is just like a file, which is replicated on thousands of users computers.  You couldn't destroy it without destroying every last copy.
There's not some central server somewhere that everything relies on.  Bitcoin is decentralized.  You can download bitcoin core, sync it up with the 30GB blockchain, and then you are "the main blockchain" along with everyone who is doing it.
There is no "hacking into" it because bitcoin's security is not based on access control, it's based on cryptography and mathematics.  It's completely open to the world.

You're right that variants can be created out of thin air, but I disagree that it only requires a few institutional connections and improvements to trump bitcoin.

Think about all the work that's being done in spaces like ATMs, wallet software/hardware, payment processing, merchant adoption, exchanges.  There's also the fact that Bitcoin is where the development talent and focus is.  Then, you have the Bitcoin community which is not something you can summon overnight or buy with money.

If you keep them the site you purchase them from, then you really only own an IOU from them that they will let you withdraw your bitcoin when you choose to.  If the site gets hacked, the company might become unable to pay back all their depositors.
If you withdraw the bitcoins to your own wallet, then it's a different story.  This is tangible because you own the private keys that allow you to spend them, so you truely own coins on the blockchain.  If you're going to do this with any serious amount of money, use a Trezor and you'll be safe as houses.

It's done before, and after mining.  Miners are incentivised to validate the transactions they put into their blocks, because if they include a bad transaction then others won't accept their block and so their mining effort will have gone to waste.  All nodes also validate all transactions in each new block, not trusting the miner.  Each full node operates trustlessly and checks everything.  For example, someone who sets up a full node now will do full validation of all blocks, including those that were mined years ago.

Coins don't actually have a linear heritage.  So each bit is not likely to be purely from one block or past transaction.
For example, if I have 10 bits that came from the pizza transaction, and 10 bits that came from Hal Finney, you combine them both into a transaction with an output of 20 bits and now those 20 bits are a 50/50 mix of both.
It's like genetics, if you go back far enough we all have the same parents.  So I would assume that everyone's coins are traceable back to the pizza transaction and other historical coins.

PoS only works when it is centralized.  Show me a PoS chain that works without checkpoints.  They can't, because anyone can fork from the genesis block and generate a equal-length chain where they own *every* private key in the network, and no one would be able to tell which chain is legit.  It all relies on the developers assigning their consensus by recording checkpoints in the code.  If PoW is criticised for encouraging centralisation, PoS should be criticised for being completely centralized by design.

So what?  It will reach an equilibrium price where supply meets demand.  There is 3600 BTC per day of new coins.  If there is $1M per day of new money then the price will be $277.  If there is $20M per day of new money then the price will be more like $5K.  Of course there's other factors like bag holders cashing out, but you get my point.  It's simple math.
The price is falling because it wants to find an equilibrium at a lower price.  There's nothing wrong with that except that it might not meet your expectations of getting wildly rich overnight.

Any wallet is going to have to know your key in order to sign the transaction.  Any wallet could leak that key if it was maliciously coded.  You're never going to escape that possibility unless you're doing all your signing offline on an airgapped machine, but the point of your post was to avoid that.  Whatever wallet you use, you're going to have to trust it to securely handle your private keys.


It only knows one of the keys.  It stores an encrypted copy of another key, but only you know the passphrase to decrypt it.
The nLocktime issue can't be fixed until transaction malleability is eliminated.  But that's why I suggest just using multisig as a hot wallet.  Offline electrum is good for cold storage.  It shouldn't be too painful to top up your hot wallet once per month from cold storage.

A full node keeps track of the blockchain by downloading / storing blocks, finding the longest chain and validating all transactions within that chain to ensure the chain follows the rules (eg. no double spends, signatures are valid, coin generation rules are followed).  They also are responsible for tracking and relaying unconfirmed transactions.
A full node + wallet is everything you need to be your own bank in a trustless way.
Miners simply do proof-of-work, which is just the act of repeatedly altering a block template and checking its hash until the hash is below the target difficulty.  The miner will need to obtain the block template from a full node, because only a full node would be able to know which block should be built on top of, and which transactions are valid for inclusion in the next block.


Not really sure what you mean by heavy lifting.  Mining itself is the most intense and expensive part of the bitcoin network, so you could say that the miners are doing the heavy lifting.  In a pooled mining setup, only the pool operator needs to run a full node, and the pool can give out block templates to the miners.

It's forever provably in the blockchain. If you want to preserve your proof, just store it away safely.  You just need to show that the transaction links to the block header via a merkle branch.
If you meant that the blockchain will guarantee that someone *else* will store your proof for you, then no, that's absurd as bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer system, so no one can have guarantees over the behaviour of their peers.

The commons is bitcoin itself.  If pools don't raise the transaction rate (by making bigger blocks), then they'll force fees up to the point where small payments are unaffordable and far more expensive than credit card fees.  This will hurt bitcoin's usefulness and thus its adoption rate and market value, which would in turn effect the value of the all miner's rewards.  Unfortunately, pools would only be better off if they *all* agreed to make larger blocks.  But if they do this, anyone can come along and undercut them with smaller blocks and profit more than the others.  The result is that blocks stay small and bitcoin suffers.  This is exactly the tragedy of the commons.

Bitcoin can easily move to new algorithms if the existing ones are weakened.  It also combines different algorithms to create multiple layers of defence.  You'd have to pre-image both SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160, as well as breaking ECDSA, in order to steal someone's coins.  All of these algorithms can be swapped in and out with upgrades.
None of your criticisms apply to bitcoin specifically, you're just questioning cryptography.  Spend some time researching and you'll see how advanced the field really is.

I meant that it's the average cost per day to sustain it long term.  Yes, there would be a large capital outlay because honest miners don't only invest to mine for 1 day.  But in principal i hope you can see how the mining rewards are what drives the total investment from honest minere, which in turn drives the cost of attack.
Another way to think of it is that i could start a pool and pay 20% higher returns to my miners. A profit-seeking miner would have an incentive to move to my pool. So in a way i'm "buying" temporary hash power for close to the cost of the block rewards, plus some premium to incentivise the move to my pool.

This is why there's talk about putting a UTXO hash in blocks as a consensus rule. At least in that case you are only trusting the mining majority (SPV-level validation). It also enhances SPV by enabling fraud proofs (someone can prove to you that an output is or isn't in the UTXO set without you having to download the whole set).
@_date: 2015-08-22 00:26:18


That's right. The nature of bitcoin mining is that anyone and everyone can/will invest money in mining gear if there is profit to be made.  This drives up the difficulty to the point where it is only marginally profitable for the average miner to mine. That's why a $2000 piece of mining hardware should be expected to return somewhere close to $2000 or less of bitcoin when factoring in electricity costs. If there was a $2000 mining machine on the market which was expected to yield $10,000 of bitcoin, they would sell like crazy until the difficulty went high enough to bring the yield back down to break-even. You can verify this by reaearchig the cost of miners and see that they tend to operate close to break-even point.
So for an attacker wants to 51% the bitcoin network today, they need to match the hash power of the whole network. Assuming the attacker has access to the same or similar technology and energy costs, then the cost of attack will roughly match the amount or total investment from the honest miners.
So in the scenario where there is only $2.50 per block of rewards on offer, no profit-seeking miner would spend thousands of dollars on hashing power because they would be making a loss. Therefore the cost for the attacker to match the network hash rate is equally low.
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:51:05
The technical debate comes down to the tradeoffs between decentralisation and scale.  One of the founding principles of bitcoin is that it eliminates third party trust.  But a user can only enjoy this trustlessness if they are able to check every transaction in the blockchain.  If blocks get too big (as they possibly are already), users become unable to validate the full chain, so they must fall back to SPV validation which requires putting trust in miners, which significantly weakens the trust model.
On the other hand, keeping blocks small means that the on-blockchain transactions will be fewer and more expensive since competition for block space will drive fees up.
A key criticism of increasing the block size now is that it only changes a constant factor, it doesn't actually improve any of the computer science.  The computer science says it's an O(n^2) problem (everyone needs to download and validate everyone elses transactions to maintain trustlessness).  Some fear that increasing the constants will "kick the can down the road" by delaying the effects of fee pressure, which could remove the incentives to produce real alternatives.
There are some efforts in progress to try to achieve scale without needing every transaction to be on-chain, but still preserving the trustlessness property (see payment channels / lightning network / sidechains).

But not everyone increases their fees.  It's called demand elasticity and it occurs in any market.  If McDonalds gave away free icecream, the lines would be out the door and the staff would not be capable of serving the capacity.  But when the price goes to 30 cents, suddenly the queue drops down to a normal level.
In our example here with the span attacks, there is definitely elasticity because the higher the fees, the less transactions the spammer can afford to send.  In the spam attacks so far, the fees have never gone over a small number of cents per KB so it is easy for a normal user to outbid them.

The reason people refer to payment channels as instant payment is because they're not double spendable, so you can treat the payment as final since you have a signed transaction that can't be double spent.  The reason that people wait for confirmations on the bitcoin network is to ensure a payment is not double spent, because absent a "smarter contract" such as in payment channels, regular bitcoin outputs can be double spent.

Math. I'll do you a favour and assume that world population thrives and the planet is sustaining 50 billion people in 100 years. Let's also assume that we've solved the issues of poverty, food, water, energy and so the average net worth per person is $100,000 in today's dollars. We're all enjoying a great quality of life. Let's also be optimistic and say that BTC has been wildly successful and is now the global monetary standard with no competing currencies.
Assuming 20 million BTC in circulation, this allows for 40,000 satoshi per person. Accounting for average net worth, this yields a price of $2.50 per satoshi. Perhaps enough to buy an ice cream.
If the block reward is $2.50, that's $360 per day paid to miners.
So under your scenario where 1 satoshi per block funds network security, it now costs only $360 per day to 51% attack the network. In other words, it's way too little. Fees *must* fund security (mining) at that point.

If you've been relayed the transaction from the bitcoin network, then it means it's valid assuming you're not connected to an attacker's node.  So checking the validity and unspentness of the inputs is already done for you.  If want to be completely sure of a transactions validity, you need to run a full node.
However, the issue with zero-conf is more around double spending.  You can receive a valid transaction but it could be double spent by a conflicting transaction in the next block.
To do trustless instant confirmations, you need a network of payment channels like the lightning network, which is still under development.
Another alternative is to use a multisig wallet with a trusted co-signer, like GreenAddress's "instant confirmations" feature.  So long as the restaurant trusts GreenAddress not to be complicit in fraud, then they can safely accept the payment with 0 confirmations.  And obviously GreenAddress (and other providers) have an incentive to avoid double spends to protect their reputation.

There are different types of DoS.  The block size limit is there to stop DoS whereby full nodes are unable to download and validate blocks, which means they are basically unable to be a full node.  This is the kind of DoS the harms decentralisation.
Another type of DoS is where the network is flooded with unconfirmed transactions.  Unlike blocks, nodes are are *not* forced to download and validate these transactions.  That's why it's much easier to handle DoS at this layer.  Just drop it and don't relay it.  Nodes are free to run whatever policy they choose as this layer exists outside of the consensus rules.

When blocks are full, less users doesn't mean less transactions. Just like more users doesn't mean more transactions (since we can't go past the hard limit).

Making the block size large enough so that no amount of spam can fill it is a poor solution as it just puts the burden on every single node to store and process all that spam.  It's like saying that we should solve the email spam problem by making our inbox capacity bigger instead of applying a spam filter.
And, there are still no technical reasons why a spammer can't fill 20MB blocks, leaving us back in the same situation.
The bitcoin network can and should drop transactions that don't pay a high enough fee.  At the moment, we're talking a few cents to outbid spam.  The problem is that the wallets don't let the users choose to pay a few cents to avoid the delays.

No it doens't.  The number of transactions stays the same because the person who paid a lower fee than you will take your place in the block.  Again, fee pressure assumes there is competition for block space, ie. a backlog of transactions.  If there's no backlog, there's no fee pressure.

I suppose you could describe the complexity of a problem by its best known solution, eg. "comparison-based sorting is an O(n * logn) problem".  In some cases, a lower bound is proven (as with sorting), and in some other cases, it's not yet proven whether a more efficient solution might exist.

I like Peter Wuille's ~17.7% pa growth rate proposal. It allows headroom to reclaim some decentralisation as technology grows, freeing up some of that bandwidth for other purposes. And if you think about it, 17% compound growth is still very fast.
I would love to be able to run a fully validating node on my phone eventually, and this is the kind of proposal that should allow for that.
The most controversial part about it is that it begins from 1MB and doesn't take its first step until 2017.

There are basically 3 levels of security:
- Full validation: Downloads the whole blockchain, verifies the integrity of the blockchain and stores/manages your wallet keys.  This is the option you tried.
- SPV validation: Downloads only block headers (80 bytes per block), verifies proof-of-work to know it has the longest chain, but cannot verify the full integrity of the longest chain since it doesn't see all transactions.  This type of security puts trust in miners that they are following the appropriate rules.  The theory is, they wouldn't waste money mining invalid blocks because the rest of the fully validating miners will reject their block and not extend their chain.  In practice, invalid chains can become the longest, fooling SPV clients (see the recent BIP66 fork).  These wallets still generate and store their own keys, and sign their own transactions.
- Custodial wallet: These wallets don't even see the blockchain or interact with the bitcoin network.  They don't store or manage keys.  The bitcoins are stored with a third party, just like online banking.
You can also improve SPV security by only connecting to nodes you trust.  Eg, run a fully validating node on a server, and then configure your phone's SPV wallet to verify via that node.  This way you control the software that is doing the validation on behalf of your SPV wallet.
There are also a whole host of multisig wallets which have different security models, but in terms of validation they are typically SPV.

It's not really so relevant what the size of the mempool is.  Anyone could fill it back up with low-fee transactions for little cost.  The more relevant thing to pay attention to is the fee required to get confirmed fast, which is currently ~200-500 bits per kb.

@_date: 2015-07-02 13:10:19
If you want to understand bitcoin, first lets get some of the basics right.  Bitcoin is based on public key cryptography.  That's the type of cryptography where you can generate a keypair which consists of a public key and private key which are just very large numbers that are mathematically related.
When someone sends you bitcoins, they are effectively transferring ownership of those coins to anyone who can prove ownership of the given public key (eg. your public key, if you are the recipient).  So then your wallet shows that you have a balance, because your wallet has the private key required to spend those coins.
Yes, anyone who has the private key will be able to spend those coins.  That's why you have to keep your keys secure.  No you don't need to worry about someone guessing your private key because the numbers are just so large (2^256) that brute force search is completely impossible.  So in order to find your key, they will either have to hack your computer and steal it, or make some kind of mathematical breakthrough that allows them to find your private key faster than the brute force method of guessing every possible combination.
I'm not quite sure what you meant about transactions.  Essentially a transaction is a digitally signed message saying "I authorise these bitcoins to move under control of this new public key", although bitcoin transactions do allow more advanced contracts, not only just requiring signature from a single key.

It depends on the size of the transaction.  Did you mean fee-per-kilobyte?
Also that's a very high estimate.  You must have used Bitcoin Core for that, which gives estimates that are far higher than necessary.  Try using this site: 
Minimum fee/KB for 750KB block: 0.444444444444
That means 444 bits for a 1kB transaction.  For a basic 250b transaction, 111 bits would be just fine.

Welcome to blockchains and cryptocurrency. There's a learning curve.
There is no guarantee that your transaction will be mined, and there never will be. You're comparing it to the experience of using a centralized payment system.
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:37:00
You haven't thought this through, have you?  For every person that leaves, the cost of transacting becomes cheaper for the remaining users.  This effect forms an equilibrium where blocks are full and transactions fees are at the price where they can be afforded by the users who are still using the blockchain.  That's why it's called a "fee market".
You were trying to say that users leaving causes fees to go up, which is actually the opposite of how it works.
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:08:42
I guess game theory would say that some miner will defect and accept the earlier transaction because they are guaranteed to beat the others, whereas waiting for the more profitable transaction to become valid will earn them nothing if someone else mines the first tx, or if everyone waits then they still race against others to confirm the 2nd and could lose.
I guess there's an expected profit value depending on their percentage of network hash rate, but it only works if no one defects.  It's more likely that a smaller miner would defect as they have a lesser chance of mining the 2nd tx.
@_date: 2015-07-22 09:46:22
Miners raising fees through a cartel is unrelated to block size.  That could happen whatever the block size.
You claimed that if we bump into transaction throughput limits due to the block size limit, this increased fees will cause the number of transactions to drop, and I'm questioning that logic because by definition, being constrained by block size implies that we're at the limit of transaction throughput, so the throughput can't be dropping otherwise it's a contradiction.
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:14:23


Sure, and bitcoin transactions only become more expensive when blocks are full.  Therefore to talk about rising fees and falling numbers of transactions is a contradiction, as I have explained already in my two previous posts.


That's not how it works.  There is no inherent cost to mining a transaction.  The cost of creating a block is driven by the natural competition between miners which finds an equilibrium where the miners are marginally profitable.  The total revenue from transaction fees will only ever be what the users are willing to pay.  If miner revenue is not adequate amount of money to keep the network secure, then the network becomes more vulnerable to attack.
Also remember that total miner revenue in real terms is average fee * number of transactions * value of bitcoin, so optimising miners earnings (and hence security) is not just about keeping blocks small, nor is it about making them excessively large with near-free transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:17:39
OK, that's what I suspected.  So I need to use an airgapped machine to make the wallet secure.  That almost defeats the purpose of it if you're using it for cold storage.  If you've got a secure airgapped machine, you can use a software wallet.
I guess I'll stick with Trezor until ledger can make a device with a screen.
@_date: 2015-07-26 03:26:01
You are basically arguing that the blockchain can and should support any volume of transactions that gets thrown at it, which shows a misunderstanding of bitcoin's scaling properties.  Either that, or you don't realise that a finite transaction limit necessitates a fee market which necessitates RBF / CPFP.
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:30:52
Plus we need to get wallets on board with adaptive fees.  And having some kind of fee bumping mechanism to prevent stuck transactions would be good too (eg. CPFP or RBF).

180 bits per kB.  There's ya problem mate.
You're sitting behind ~20MB of transactions that pay more than you.

If I (the customer) am using a GreenAddress wallet, my funds are stored in a 2-of-2 multisig address.  I can't spend that money without GreenAddress's signature on the transaction.  For me to double spend, GreenAddress would have to sign my double spend.  They call this their "instant confirmation" service because if you trust them not to sign double spends, then you can safely accept 0 conf payments from users of their wallet.
Side note: to prevent your funds being locked up indefinitely in the 2-of-2 address (eg. if the trusted co-signer dissapeared or lost their keys), GreenAddress pre-signs an nlocktime transaction that refunds the coins back to an address under the user's control.  So the nlocktime mechanism provides a guarantee that you can always get your money back, but the locktime delay allows the instant confirmation feature to work.
@_date: 2015-07-22 09:14:15


That doesn't make any sense.  Fees rise when there's competition for block space.  A fee market only exists when blocks are full.  So I don't know where you're getting "amount of transactions reduce" since that's directly contrary to there being a fee market.
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:08:54

Ok so imagine I'm rolling a 6 sided dice repeatedly. On average, I will roll a 1 every 6 rolls. So if I do 300 rolls I would *expect* to get 50 1's, but it's a poisson process just like Bitcoin mining so there will be varience.
Now imagine at some point I'm on an unlucky streak and I've rolled 30 times in a row without getting a 1. What is the probability that I'll get a 1 in the next 6 rolls? It's actually the same odds as when I started. The 30 unlucky rolls don't effect the outcome of future rolls as they are independent events.
I think the piece you're missing is the "given" part.
What is the probability that I roll a 1 within 36 rolls *given* that I haven't hit it in 30 rolls?
The same applies for mining. The probability that a block takes 1hr 10 mins *given* that it's already been an hour, is the same probability that a block takes 10 mins in the first place.
So at any given moment, no matter how long we've been waiting, the expected time till next block is 10 mins.
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:23:23
Nope, there's solutions to that that don't require the block size to increase.  CPFP and RBF.
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:24:01
I said to ignore orphan costs because it simplifies to statement that excluding transactions will earn less profit. Its unrelated to point I was making. The fee per kb required to pay for orphan costs will be a floor on transaction fees. It doesn't change anything we've discussed, other than complicating the details.
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:07:44
You're kidding right?  The *only* thing that we leave behind are the blocks we mine.  Those blocks will need to be downloaded and processed by any new nodes from now until all eternity.  The block size is the only mechanism we have to limit that.  If you raise it and let it fill with spam, it's placing an unnecessary burden on future nodes.
The p2p network being flooded with unconfirmed transactions isn't as big a deal.  It's not a permanent scar.  We can work on solutions to that which require no forks (eg. adaptive wallet fees, mempool pruning, replace-by-fee, child-pays-parent, max tx chain depth, dynamic minimum fee policy, and so on).
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:49:22
Sorry I think I got you confused with [this guy](
Yes it could definitely stunt growth.  My main point all along was that high fees don't cause transaction throughput to fall.
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:56:13
From a UX perspective, the wallet could sign the fee-bump transactions all at once when the user sends the first tx (but doesn't broadcast them yet). Then the bumping feature doesn't need to ask for the user's authorization again.
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:15:11


Unfortunately game theory says otherwise. Deliberately excluding fee-paying transactions from your blocks only reduces your earnings (if we put orphan rate aside). This strategy only works if miners form a cartel. A small portion of the hash rate defecting would spoil this.

You want to hard fork the definition of a "bitcoin"? Not happening.
@_date: 2015-04-01 10:48:41
Normally you don't.  The sender should generate a new address specifically for receiving your payment, and when money hits the address it means you've paid.  If they are using the same address to receive payments from multiple people then it's going to get confusing for them.
There are ways you could cryptographically prove that you controlled the money that went to them, but it's complicated and not the right way to do things.
There's a payment protocol (BIP70) which is designed to solve this exact problem.  The bitcoin core wallet supports it.  The receiver can generate a "payment request" and send it to the customer who can then pay that, which is proof that they paid the specific invoice/payment request.
@_date: 2015-04-19 23:52:53
It doesn't make a lot of sense to me if devices like cars and street sweepers are managing private keys.  It would be more logical to have the devices communicate with my central hot wallet to request / authorise payments.  This way you can have a centrally managed security policy (eg. spending limits, authorised payees) and a more consolidated pool of funds.

You're not understanding the lightning idea.
it's a web of micropayment channels. You only need one channel open to a single counter party and you can transact with anyone in the network. The same way that you only need one connection to your ISP and you can exchange packets with any host. The web of micropayments routes the payment to the destination trustlessly.
Also, as you hopefully know, all of this can be implemented in a seamless way into software so that the user experience is as simple as "scan and pay".
Micropayment channels also allow you to effectively have the transactions be instant due to the guarantees build into the contracts. 
It's also potentially more private since the blockchain doesn't record all of your transactions. Blockchain transactions are only necessary when people close or open their channels.

The double spending problem is a classic problem that had plagued digital cash until Satoshi solved it with his proof-of-work blockchain.
Basically, it's impossible to guarantee that everyone sees everything happen in the same order.  Imagine if you broadcast two transactions spending the same coins.  One tx is broadcast in Europe, and the other in Asia.  Now the nodes in Europe accept the first transaction, and reject the asian one as a double spend.  The nodes in asia do the opposite because they saw them in the other order (due to network latency).  The result is that you have a consensus split, and no incentive for nodes to come to agreement (who's going to concede and say "sure, take the money, I'll forfeit my payment"?).
On top of this, you also have the issue of network outages, out-of-order packets, and nodes coming and going from the network who need to find out what happened while they were gone, without having to take someones word for it (ie. trustlessly).
The blockchain solves this by saying that we accept the longest chain as the true history (and order) of transactions.  So in order to prevent double spends, you need to make sure your transaction is confirmed into the blockchain, and then each and every block that is built on top makes it exponentially less probable that an attacker can double spend it (assuming the attacker does not control &gt;50% of the total processing power of the network).

It's not immutable without miners.  That's what everyone is trying to tell you.  You don't get the decentralised trustless property without it being public and secured by a majority of the world's hashing power.
@_date: 2015-03-13 02:02:12
Then it's not a blockchain and this story has very little to do with bitcoin.  Blockchains are about decentralised timestamping, and making history exponentially harder to modify as more work is piled on top.
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:31:54
These arguments are going in circles.  There is no point using a blockchain if you don't need its trustlessness.  The blockchain is *not* an efficient database because its design sacrifices performance and scalability to achieve trustless consensus.  Its bandwidth requirements scale O(n^2).  The standard for distributed databases is scaling out linearly.  Or, you just buy a big enterprise server and can do millions of transactions per second with full ACID compliance.
@_date: 2015-03-27 08:51:32
Is it trustless though?  A key feature of the blockchain is that you can go offline, come back, and know which valid chain to accept without any trust (you just accept the one with the most work).  If you are syncing your Mars chain, how do you know who was honest about the entropy and who was lying?  You'd have to trust someone else to tell you what the entropy was since you weren't there to observe it yourself. Which just degenerates into the byzantine generals problem again.

We already discussed using trusted signatures earlier in this thread.  I think you're assuming that you can just hack away at the blockchain's fundamental design and still be left with something secure and useful.  You might want to do a very thorough analysis of its security properties with your changes.  Having weak PoW and trusted signatures sounds to me like it takes away the good parts (importantly, the security within the blockchain itself) and adds nothing of value back..
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:15:21


@_date: 2015-03-27 20:08:55
But it's not trustless for *new* participants who didn't have a sensor before, or weren't around to observe the entrpy (maybe they weren't even born yet when some blocks were mined). In that case they have to pick who they trust to resolve any competing chain problems. That aint trustless :). Bitcoin relies on no external state, so you can validate a chain without any trust.

Some people believe in big government, social safety nets, publically funded infrastructure etc.  So they support the government taxing and spending.
What they probably don't realise though is that deficit spending is really stealing money from future generations who are not yet old enough to vote against it, which is morally wrong.
Also, the fact that the government has to borrow from private banks and pay interest to them on money that they created out of thin air, should be wrong in anyone's book, but most people don't really grasp that aspect.

256-bit ECDSA gives 128-bit security.  Reducing the ECDSA key size would be weakening the crypto.
Also, addresses came later.  Bitcoin worked with pay-to-pubkey scripts before addresses were implemented as a convenience.  Addresses are convenient because they are shorter than a full pubkey.

I think you're right that wealth preservation is a major app for bitcoin, but it only works if there is also some fundamental demand for the currency.  Even if it is small niches like remittance and online shopping for people without CCs, and online gambling.  The more fundamental demand there is to support a price floor makes it more convincing as a store of value.  Otherwise I think it'd be too much of a house of cards for people to put so much faith in it.
The good thing is that I think that there will be more and more little niches pop up until it hopefully hits a critical mass and triggers mainstream adoption.

Gold is a rare element.  Blockchains can be replicated many different times as altcoins.  There's no reason stake so much faith in Bitcoin's value if it doesn't have the network effect behind it (network effect being merchants, software, services etc, the kinda stuff that I would refer to as fundamentals).  I think it needs way more fundamentals to drive its market cap to a trillion, like way more users and transactions, much greater software support, the list goes on.  Gold really doesn't need that stuff, because it's gold and nothing else can be gold.

Very fascinating chart!
Here is some speculation:
The strong diagonal across the chart are fast circulating coins, so these move from recent addresses to new addresses.  However I'm confused about why there is a glow *underneath* that line, rather than on top.  I'm assuming the glow must represent the different speeds of fast-circulating coins.  But it would have made more sense to me if it was on top, otherwise it shows new addresses sending to older addresses.  Also the solid area along the bottom of the graph would also suggest lots of transactions from new addresses back to old addresses - isn't that backwards?
I'm going to speculate that the vertical lines could be coin mixing.  Not sure what the horizontal ones are.. perhaps they are services who re-use addresses, like bitpay or some exchanges?  That might be why there is a constant flow of funds back to the same old wallets.
**edit:  OP are you sure it's not source on the vertical, dest on the horizontal?**

Bitcoin is secured through proof-of-work.  You can't alter the ledger without doing a massive amount of computation.  The ledger is also constantly growing with more computation added (imagine blocks are like adding new pages, and new pages cost a lot of computing work to produce).  The rule is that the longest chain wins, or the ledger with the most pages, so for your ledger to win you will need to build blocks faster than the rest of the network combined.  Also, since the whole ledger is open for everyone's software to read and verify, any ledger you produce needs to follow the rules of set out by the network.  If you're cheating those rules, people can see that and won't accept it as valid.

Some comments:
- The 5th step in retrieving from cold storage involves plugging a USB stick into an offline computer that contains an unencrypted private key. Doesn't this go against your rules?
- The initial key generation process says that the keys are "deleted". Are the unencrypted keys ever written to disk? If so, how do you securely erase that. Maybe you should consider a ramdisk to hold the keys before you encrypt them. How about completely destroying the machine that did the key generation?
- How are the encrypted private keys transported from the printer to the bank. Is there a chance they could be copied at this stage?

Fair point.  What I meant by that is that I think you're trying to imagine a future where bitcoin, in its current state, replaces all fiat.  I agree that that's not realistic.  However bitcoin is just a base technology layer that can be built on top of, and *is* being built on top of at a rapid pace.  Wallets are getting easier to use, hardware wallets are just beginning to emerge, the market is still very illiquid and has a long way to grow, and merchant adoption is barely even a thing now, so it's no wonder that the PoS solutions are awkard.  But many of us see past this and see the potential.  Just like people in the 90s saw the potential of the internet when it was a horrendously slow and clunky system, and now *everyone* is scrolling through their friends photos with their thumb on a beautiful touchscreen while riding the train.

Yeah.  To provide the proof you show someone the original transaction, which they can hash, and you provide a merkle path that links this hash to the block's merkle root.  This is a trustless proof that the transaction existed in the blockchain.

If you're using proof-of-work and the longest chain rule then you can't vet participants, you're just trusting that the chain with the most work is honest.

Either.  Both are just the contents of a transaction.  Showing the document hash (or merkle root hash) inside a transaction, and linking that transaction to a block, proves the existence of the document at that point in time.
Pruning is only done by each individual node, it's not a feature of the blockchain itself.  Pay to pubkey hash outputs can't be pruned until they are spent as they are part of the utxo set so could be required for validating future blocks.  OP_RETURN outputs are unspendable so they can be pruned right away by nodes who aren't interested in that data.

Bitcoin doesn't have a plan, it's just a technology.  People can use it how they please.  We'll have to watch and see how it plays out.
I think fiat money could definitely go extinct.  It could either be replaced by commodity money, or cryptocurrency, as both are higher quality forms of money in terms of soundness.  The world desperately needs sound money in this era of central banking madness.  Throughout history, money has always been commodity-backed, until only recent decades when we came off that standard.
Given the rapid advancement of computers and the internet into all aspects of our lives, I can definitely see cryptocurrency playing a significant role.  It creates so many possibilities that don't exist with other forms of money.

I understand that it's completely pointless. If you're throwing away the proof of work and using trusted signatures, why are there multiple parties producing blocks and who produces the next block?  It just sounds like the nodes are batching up transactions and periodically committing them to a shared state whenever they decide to do so.  There's no great innovation there, nothing that couldn't have already been done in the last 20 years using existing technologies.
Or if it's just one party producing the blocks, we just have a centralised database all over again.  What benefit is the blockchain even offering here?

The bitcoin price has historically moved in bubbles, which can best be illustrated on a log chart: 
Money gets its value through shared faith, which must be especially true for a form of money that has no central backing and is purely digital. So it's no wonder that the market moves with a herd mentality. If the price is going up, this signals that others are confident in its value and legitimacy as a currency, which in itself makes it more likely to succeed (a positive feedback loop). Likewise if the price is falling, it means people are losing confidence and bitcoin is losing popularity which makes people fear that it will fade into insignificance and makes them avoid it (a negative feedback loop). Basically, these feedback loops make people buy high and sell low, creating a boom bust cycle.
All the while it has a long term uptrend which presumably is due to the growing ecosystem.
Personally I think there will be another bubble. The whole ecosystem has come so far, and sooner or later the herd is going to realise that bitcoin has more potential than they're currently giving it credit for, leading to another euphoric mania.

Multisig just refers to an address that requires signatures of multiple keys to spend from.  Address re-use is a wallet implementation detail which would apply for both single sig and multisig addresses.
Back in the day when you had to use bitcoin-core CLI to generate multisig addresses and manually email around pubkeys, people would re-use addresses because there was no multisig wallet software to manage this.  It's kinda like how people re-use paper wallet addresses because its complex to keep making new ones.
Bip32 makes it easy because you can just share your xpub keys and then both parties can generate as many multisig addresses as they want, with the knowledge of the other party's pubkeys.  The greenaddress and greenbits wallet implements that so there is no address reuse.

That's not how crypto works. The system doesn't issue the users a private key. The user has to pick the key themself and they do this secretly so that no one else knows the key. If you had a central system issueing keys then it would be entirely insecure.
Your concern should not be about some innocent user happening to generate the same key, you should be more concerned by a determined attacker who is generating trillions of keys per second to search for bitcoins. Resistance to brute force attack is the whole point of crypto systems. That's why they use such large key spaces.
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:35:48
The virus can alter the key generation process so that you're generating insecure keys.
For example, imagine if the attacker bugged your wallet software so that instead of generating a truely random 256 bit private key, it would only generate a random 32-bit number, then sha256 hash that value and xor the result with the attackers hard-coded 256bit seed, and then sha256 that again.  To you, the numbers would look perfectly random, but it's actually trivial for the attacker to generate all 2^32 addresses and watch them / sweep them when they see coins sent there.

It's an interesting question.  If you were asking this when bitcoin was only a small open source project and the coins had no value, it would seem that the project could only appeal to a very niche type of user (passionate libertarian geek with an interest in finance).  Surely there's only a limited number of those types out there, and once exhausted the project would no longer grow?  Well the success to date has proven that this is not the case, and that the more it grows, the more accessible it becomes to new types of people.  It's clearly a viral phenomenon.
You don't need to understand the intricacies of the financial system to see the need for bitcoin either.  Especially in countries facing a currency crisis.  When there is high inflation/rapid currency devaluation/capital controls/ATM withdrawal limits/bail-ins/bank holidays, it's clear to anyone that they need to take some action to protect their wealth.  If you follow the news headlines relating to global finance, we're clearly headed towards a period of instability where we can expect this type of stuff to be happening in many countries.

Yes.  People don't seem to get it that the supply of money has almost no effect on the real economy.
OK so imagine that Ben Bernanke flys around in his helicopter and drops millions of dollars on every household.  There would be a brief short term disruption to the economy and people go crazy and spend, but very quickly prices would form an equilibrium and everything would continue as normal with new prices.  (not though: there is a wealth transfer from people who saved in the past, to the new people who had notes dropped on them)
The exact same happens for deflation - if a zero were knocked off everyones bank accounts overnight, there would be a short term disruption while the market forms an equilibrium, then we return to normal with new lower prices. (although with deflation, the savers benefit instead of being punished)
These are both drastic examples - if we have the supply/demand for money changing more gradually, there should not even be any observable short term effect.
Money is not production... money is not labour... it is simply a utility which will be priced like every other good/service through supply and demand.
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:33:34
No source, but it's sensible practice to generate a new address for each payment you receive and I assumed that most people do this.  Otherwise if someone traces one of your transactions, they've tracked you down to all of them.
Like if I always withdrew all mt. gox purchases to one address, anyone looking at one withdrawal could work out how many coins I own, when I purchased them, etc.
The other thing is that it also correlates your expenses together.  Not that people necessarily have anything to hide, but for example if you had tax authorities auditing you, it'd make it easy for them to determine which coins are yours and how much capital gains tax you might owe.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:50:48
I don't think there would be a sudden and immediate shift in value overnight to a new crytomoney.  Any rivals would have to follow a similar path to bitcoin, from being an unknown $0 alt, growing through a speculative phase, and then growing into mainstream adoption with VC investment, media coverage etc.
It could happen, but there would be plenty of time to react.  There are plenty of strategies you could have to cope with this, eg. trade half of your BTC into the new one when it becomes equal to BTC's market cap.
I think it's only a long term issue though.  First we have to run into fundamental problems/limitations of bitcoin and have a new coin arise as a better alternative.
@_date: 2013-06-17 09:54:26
I see.  Well in that case, the blockchain does not contain all inputs/outputs - it only stores about 1 in every 90 quadrillion based on current difficulty.  The guy was asking why couldn't you just store a list of all your previous hashes and use them when the criteria changes such that the hash now forms a valid block.  The answer is of course as you said - any new block needs to reference the previous block, so all previous hashing work is not helpful for finding a new block.
@_date: 2013-10-09 22:51:58

There seems to be an actual problem developing recently where miners are not including many transactions in their blocks (in order to reduce block size which in turn reduces the chances of orphan blocks), which is resulting in higher-than-usual confirmation times, unless you pay very high fees.  This can been seen by the blockchain chart, it shows a recent divergence from the trend.  I am concerned that this could become a bigger problem if miners continue to prefer small blocks.

I'm buying to hold for a very long time, until the bitcoin economy grows so much that I can travel the world spending my BTC fortunes.  .... or until bitcoin disintegrates and they become worthless.
I partly agree with the "just amass bitcoins and don't worry about price" thing, but timing your entry is also critically important if you're making a one-time purchase rather than dollar cost averaging.  If you were to have put, say, $5K of savings into BTC at $160, you've now lost half of your money on paper when it hits $80.  Although that's only a paper loss, it also means you've missed out on the opportunity to buy twice the amount of bitcoins for that $5K @ $80 per coin.  In 20 years time, this will effect your fortune by 50%.
If on the other hand you are making steady purchases over time (eg. dedicate a portion of each pay check into purchasing bitcoin), then you could ignore the price and just keep buying.

In the ATM scenario, there's two ways you could do it.  One is to buy a whole lot of bitcoins upfront to stock the ATM, then sell the coins at market rates, collect the cash, and periodically take the cash out of the machine and buy new coins with them.  Through this method, you carry exchange rate risk, because your profit depends on the price of bitcoins at the time you sell.  If the price dropped since you stocked your machine, you lose money on those sales, and if it rises, you gain money.  When you exchange the cash for bitcoins, it also makes a big difference what the price is, because that will determine how many new coins you will get for re-stocking.
The other way to do it does not involve any exchange rate risk on each transaction.  What you do is buy an initial buffer amount of coins (say, 200 BTC).  You also have an exchange account with some cash, say $20K.  Now whenever someone withdraws BTC from your machine you accept the cash, dispense the BTC, and simultaneously do a purchase on the exchange.  For example, say the exchange rate was currently $100 per BTC, but you charge $101 on your ATM to make profit.  Someone wants to purchase 5 BTC from your ATM with cash. So you give the person 5 BTC and take their $505 dollars.  You simultaneously purchase 5 BTC on the market for $500.  Now, you are left with $505 in the ATM, $19500 on the exchange, 195 BTC in the ATM and 5 BTC in the exchange.  Therefore, you are in the exact same position, with no additional exchange rate risk, except with $5 additional cash.  You then transfer the 5 BTC from the exchange to the ATM to fill it back up.  Once in a while, you remove the cash from the ATM and deposit it into your exchange account so that it is available for exchange purhases (and pocket the $5 profit) - your net position never changes (in terms of cash OR bitcoins).
So in the 2nd scenario, you are essentially a middleman who is not holding onto cash or BTC for any long period of time, other than the initial buffer amount which remains constant.  In the first scenaro, its much worse because you end up running your BTC reserves down over time and having to repurchase them at a later time, at which point you will make or lose money depending on what the exchange rate did (hence, exchange rate risk).
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:16:52

Firstly, there have been many whale dumps already.  I remember one in June where someone dumped 30K BTC (over $3.5M worth) on Gox at one.  It sent the price down about $10 from $128 to $118, and then the price recovered quite a bit in the following minutes.  What kind of size of dumping are you talking about?  If you step it up an order of magnitude, you're talking hundreds of thousands dumped in one trade, or millions.  Presumably something this devastating could move the price more like $50 if they were silly enough to dump them all at once.  But still, the market would settle on a new price and trading would go on.  There are only a limited amount of times this can happen until the people with large holdings have sold out.
Secondly, here is a visualisation which indiates that the ownership of bitcoins is spreading out and becoming increasingly less concentrated:

Looking at the long term chart, after the previous bubble, it didn't hit its low until months after the peak.  It was a steady decline from bubble to bottom.  Right now there is still quite a bit of media attention around bitcoin following the $260 peak.  What about in a few months when the media has forgotten about it again and all of the people who got on the bandwagon are slowly losing their faith?

What do you mean by accepting the client?  Miners can continue to behave rationally and be greedy with transaction fees.  The new system is designed to be incentive-compatible.  Miners will always have an incentive to include the highest fee-per-kilobyte transactions in their blocks.  The miners don't need to change their behaviour at all.
The new wallet update will help *users* to save money on fees whilst getting transactions processed in a timely way, because the wallet will determine an appropriate fee level based on observation from recent transactions and blocks.  So it's the users who will be incentivised to install it in order to save themselves money and time.

Yeah but I imagine the point of such an attack wouldn't be to get the transactions into blocks.  It'd just be to disable the network.

If bitcoin difficulty was only about leading binary 0's then difficulty adjustments could only be in powers of 2 (ie. doubling or halving, by adding or removing a leading 0).  We know this to not be the case, as evidenced by the fact that difficulty can move in small and precise adjustments.  This is because the difficult target is any integer, not just a power of 2 (as would be the case when only counting leading zeros).

Well if you're mining all the blocks in less than a second, each difficulty adjustment is going to be the max difficulty adjustment which is 4x increase.  Since there are ~3305 difficulty increases left until the last reward block (block  this means the final difficulty would be 4^3305 times higher than current difficulty.  To do 2016 blocks at *current difficulty* in 1 second would require 3,628,800PH.  So that works out to be 10^1996 petahash required just to do the last 2016 reward blocks (blocks  to  in 1 second.  Since you want to do *all* remaining blocks (~6.6M) in 1 second, you'll need even more power... but.. 10^1996 is an insane and impossible number..
Edit: you might actually be stalled by this logic though [from  "A timestamp is accepted as valid if it is greater than the median timestamp of previous 11 blocks, and less than the network-adjusted time + 2 hours".  I haven't checked the code, but if it has to be *strictly bigger* than the median timestamp of the previous 11 blocks, you'd have to increment it every 11 blocks, so after the first ~79k blocks your timestamp would have increased by 2 hrs and you'd have to slow to a rate of 11 blocks per second, otherwise your timestamps would be too far into the future to be accepted.
Edit 2:  oh, haha, actually you only need 10^65 petahash to be covering the entire sha256 space every second.  So, you could literally have each block header hashing to the number 1, which is the max difficulty.  So basically you would have rendered bitcoin useless with this much power since you could break any signature and spend anyones coins easily.

Just keep an eye on   When you see the block sizes consistently hitting close to 1MB then you can start to worry.

Your edit clears up what you meant, but, it's not right.  Their business is the ATM.  They make 3% on each transaction, buy or sell, regardless of where the price goes.  Speculation on BTC price should have no part in this business.
The way it actually works is when they dispense bitcoins for cash, they would simultaneously BUY bitcoins with cash online on an exchange.  This essentially results in buying the coins on behalf of the user, and adding the fee, leaving the ATM operator with the same BTC balance, same cash balance, but gaining the 3% fee.
If you understand what I mean, you should see that the $100K of transactions made no difference to the value of their bitcoins/cash on hand, other than earning them fees.  It's not like they went out and bought a massive BTC stash and decided to let it be slowly drained at whatever price was set on the day.  That would be stupid.

Transactions are verified all the way back to the genesis block, by each and every node on the bitcoin network.  It involves *zero* trust.  This is only possible when each node has the entire blockchain.
I'm assuming by snapshot you mean, record the balance of each BTC address at a certain point in time, so that nodes can use that as a starting point and won't need any transaction history prior to the snapshot.  The problem is it breaks the trustlessness.
What you're talking about is kind've like SPV which is implemented by lightweight wallets like Electrum, Multibit.  It's weaker security because you end up trusting someone to have validated the whole blockchain for you.

The "everyone will hoard" theory of deflation is a total fallacy.  Like somehow there is a tipping point where bitcoins just become so valuable that they become worthless and collapse.  It's totally backwards logic, and here's why.
Investors will "hoard" when they see the market value of their bitcoins rising.  The market value, is determined by last trade price, and as with all markets, a rally on low volume is fickle and can easily be crashed with some small selling.
A low volume of bids at a high price will always create a race amongst sellers - not all sellers can sell at that price - only the first ones can, and then the price falls as they sell.  Assuming a "everyone is hoarding and no one is spending" scenario, the first people to spend (or sell for cash) reap the huge profits, and crash the price.  This creates a natural equilibrium that keeps itself in check in all markets.  No one sits back and believe that in a market with no volume, they somehow have all this wealth on paper that is worth holding onto and won't crash.
If this deflationary hoarding theory was true then the price wouldn't have crashed down from $260.  Why didn't everyone just hold out for a greater price if it shot up from $30 to $260?  Why sell?  Well, it turns out people want to REALISE their gains, ie. turn that paper wealth into real wealth by either spending to obtain real goods, or exchanging for another asset class such as cash.

yep.  it used to be 50 BTC per block, but it dropped to 25 late last year. The reward halves every 210,000 blocks (~4 years) until eventually the reward will drop to 0 around the year 2140.
It is *extremely* hard to mine a block though.  It's like trying to win the lottery, although the more power your mining equipment, the more tickets you have so your chances are better :)
Since it's so rare to find a block, people mine in pools.  Read up on pooled mining if you're interested.  People group together and all mine, and if 1 person finds a block then they all split the profits.  Kind've like a lotto syndicate.
EDIT: some more trivia for you - pooled mining was actually invented by a guy called slush who has been around in bitcoin since the early days.  He is currently working on a hardware wallet which is going to be a very secure way to store bitcoins, because they will be safe even if your computer is hacked / has viruses.  See  for information about the hardware wallet :)

Not sure if you got my point.  The shitty failing currency is the argentine peso, because it's being inflated away so rapidly.  No one wants to keep their savings in it because they lose ~10% per year.  Despite the government's efforts to ban the US dollar, there is still a black market for USD which sells way above the official exchange rate.
This is an example of how currencies don't lose value just because governments ban it.  The same thing will happen with USD and Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is intrinsically higher quality money than any unbacked paper currency.  Just wait until USD starts to fail - we haven't seen it yet.

When you spend coins, you're actually spending past transactions that you received.  So you can pick and choose which ones you are spending.  If someone sent you tainted coins, you could just leave them there unspent.  People can see in the blockchain if you are spending the tainted coins or not.  They aren't automatically mixed with your legit coins.

It is still positive for Bitcoin though because it adds to the bitcoin economy in the form of the goods/services changing hands, and the selling of the coins adds to exchange liquidity which makes bitcoin more attractive as a store of value.
There is also a nice feedback mechanism whereby spending increases when the BTC price goes up, so this provides a nice normalising effect to push prices back down which will help to smooth bubbles / volatility.

The argument is there.  The monetary base of a currency is the number of units of that currency that exist.  Eg. US M1 is a measure of monetary base, because it's the number of US dollars in circulation.  BTC's monetary base is the number of bitcoins in circulation.  Bitcoins "market cap" figure (the sum of all bitcoins in USD) is simply derived from the market value at any given time, so is unrelated to the monetary base.

That's the idea.  It's just the sad fact of reality that bitcoins design means that not all coins are equal.

Although it has elements of a pyramid scheme, I don't think it's a pyramid scheme for the same reason that bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme.  Sure, investors are incentivised to promote a track after investing in it (same applies to investing in bitcoin) and early investors profit more than late investors (as with bitcoin), BUT the tracks themselves have intrinsic value (they can be enjoyed as music), so the success of a track will be bound by its intrinsic value.  Investing in a crappy unpopular track will probably lose you money, but investing early on in a really hot track that's just been released by an unknown artist could turn out very profitable.  In this way, it turns people in to talent scouts and if you are good at spotting new talent, you could make money.
Yeah I think there's probably a slim chance that it would actually work, but the idea is so interesting it would be good to see it built.
@_date: 2013-12-25 09:26:00
But it's a totally new business model that's never been done before.  Basically when you buy a song, you effectively become a distributor of that track and you make money if people buy it from you, plus a portion goes back to the original artist.  Your fans become your distribution network and they earn from it.  No middlemen, labels, itunes etc, the artists will earn more, and it will give non-industry artists a way to monetize their music.

That's not quite right.  You will see more return than before, unless you have 100% of network hashrate.  Even if you own 99% of the network hashrate, turning on more miners will result in your BTC yield going up (although by a very small factor).  It doesn't ever make econonomic sense to leave profitable miners turned off (profitable meaning their btc yield will be greater than the electricity cost).

I would expect that their efforts would be covert and non-obvious.  As we've seen, any time bitcoin gets in the news it grows in popularity.  I think they are more likely to use some more subtle methods to try to sabotage and derail bitcoin, like targeting key people/businesses.

I think it's a bit debateable to call bitcoin a deflationary currency.  In the sense that inflation/deflation refer to expansion and contraction in the money supply, bitcoin is mildly inflationary until 2140 and then becomes completely stable.
There are other definitions of inflation/deflation that refer to prices, but this isn't an intrinsic property of bitcoin, its just the effect that happens when its popularity grows.

Yeah you are incorrect about how transactions work.  I suggest you read about transactions here:

@_date: 2013-10-07 02:21:24
You got a couple of things wrong there.
The key pair does *not* need to match.  To generate a duplicate address, the **hash** of the public key needs to collide.  Bitcoin addresses are hashes of public keys, and have 160 bits.  So the chances of generating the same address are 1 in 2^160.
Since public keys are 256 bits, on average you can expect that there are 2^96 different valid keypairs that would collide with your bitcoin address (&lt;insert analogy with grains of sand, atoms etc&gt;). If someone generated just one of these, they could spend your money.

Agreed, which is also a point that mustyoshi eventually made.  Hopefully when difficulty stops increasing at insane rates, miners will see the light a join smallers pools.
I think another important factor in choosing a pool will be connectivity and latency.  If your pool is well-connected, it reduces the chance of orphan blocks.  It'd be cool if pools started offering different hosts for different regions to optimise latency, with a super-low-latency backbone connecting them all.  Eventually latency might be the deciding factor over hashrate.

What's to stop coinbase from locking in a sale with a user, promising delivery in X days, purchasing immediately, and then if the price climbs over that period, they cancel the order by marking it "high risk", sell the coins, and pocket the profits.

This analogy doesn't quite work, because the extra money hasn't gone to either the customer or the merchant - it's been tipped to a middleman who processed the transaction.  If you had paid a merchant too much BTC, then it would seem reasonable to ask for it back and they should have an obligation to give it back to you, as they would with cash or a bank transfer.
You sign every transaction with a digital signature though, so it's like a contract.  You need to check things before you sign them.  Don't sign something that says you're going to pay a 200BTC fee!

Good move deleting your previous reply to me.  No doubt that would have gotten a lot of backlash.
There is a difference between selling to take profits off the table, and selling with an intention to buy back cheaper.
If you have enough BTC riches now to retire and live a modest life in the philippines, and you decide that it's enough for you and you no longer want to risk price volatility, then that's a conservative and non-greedy move - good for you.
But if, on the other hand, you actually are selling because you think there's a dip coming and you want to take advantage of it and buy in lower, then you're enhancing your risk and being more greedy.  OP falls into this 2nd case.

FATAL FLAW MAKES A MONKEY OF BITCOIN
Long touted by enthusiasts as impossible to break, and often claimed to be beyond the purview of government control, Bitcoin today finds itself under threat from a force so primitive that it makes a complete mockery of the crypto-anarchist nerd-coins: monkeys.
New research has found that a group of monkeys, if deployed in sufficient quantity, are capable of breaking bitcoin "private keys" - a sort of digital sudoku jigsaw puzzle used by virtual miners to control the inflation and deflation printed by federal reserve bit-bonds in the underground e-mafia crime world.
The weakness is said to occur when a monkey on a typewriter produces a secret key which unlocks access to a stash of bitcoins - a feat often argued as "mathematically impossible" by bitcoin radicals.
Although the market appeared unshaken by this news, experts agree that it is only a matter of time until the monkey vulnerability is exploited, which is expected to spell the end for the failed anarchist drug-induced experiment.

That isn't right, I'm quite sure of it.  The difficulty is defined by the target,  not by the block hash.  The target only changes each difficulty adjustment.
Miners find a block the first time they generate a hash below the target.  If this happens simultaneously with 2 miners, one of them will be a lower hash than the other (in your case, it's extremely improbable but one of them might be low enough to pass as double the difficulty).  The fact that one of them is lower is purely statistical randomness and does not indicate any extra 'work'. so it is not the basis of deciding which to build on.  The first to arrive gets built on.

Yup.. and the double spend is possible under a fork, and has actually been done before: 
Although under that scenario, I'm sure people could come up with an innovative way to send blocks to China.  It's only ~1MB per 10 mins so wouldn't require much bandwidth.  Maybe we need some BTC satellites that broadcast blocks, or some kind of radio broadcast network :).  Then as a bitcoin user in china, you'd just have to find a way to get your tiny transaction over to the main network if you needed to spend.  Some transactions are only 250 bytes so you could almost just read it over the phone to someone in hex.

I'm convinced that the deflationary spiral logic is wrong.  If it was true then the price of bitcoin wouldn't have crashed from $260, it would have continued its exponential rise to infinity.  The fact is that people want to realise their gains (either by selling bitcoins for dollars or spending bitcoins for cheap goods).  As soon as people start realising their gains from deflation, the effect reverses and you have inflation (the crash from $260 to $50 was 'inflation') as people race to not be the last one still hoarding.
Mass hoarding under the belief that the value will be higher tomorrow is herd mentality and will always result in a bubble that crashes.
The deflationary effect is not a positive feedback loop, it's a distortion from the real market value which will be exploited by people selling, which naturally causes a reversion to the true supply/demand value.
With fiat currencies, deflation has a worse effect since all money is debt-based and insufficient supply of money means bankruptcies must occur.

This was the one point that I don't quite agree with.  In the example, he says that if you borrow the first ever dollar into existance, and owe back 2 dollars, it's impossible to pay it back without borrowing more money, which means that the system is destined to result in ever more debt until it explodes.
Well under that scenario, the borrower could pay back the first 1 dollar of their 2 dollar debt, and then they could work for the banker (eg. plow their land) and then the banker pays them the dollar.  The borrower can then give their $1 wage back to the back to pay off the interest.  The result is that no additional money needed to be borrowed to pay the debt, but the bankers got labour for doing nothing, and the borrower is basically enslaved by the banker for no good reason other than the fact that the banker has the power to issue loans.  So definitely the system is evil, but doesn't require ever-expanding debt.  The other factor is bankruptcy where borrowed money is written off.

Is that even possible for an arbitrary pre-image to be a valid public key?  Public keys have special properties (such as being valid points on an elliptic curve) so the chances of a pre-image attack resulting in a valid 2nd key would be virtually 0.  Secondly, if your pre-image does generate a valid public key, you don't have the private key so it is useless for you.  To have the private key, you need to use the elliptic curve key generation algorithm.

I agree.  The price of money is like any other commodity in that it is determined by supply/demand ratio.  As the demand for money goes up (ie. people need money to facilitate new commerce), the value of that money goes up and hence prices drop.
The argument of hoarding doesn't quite work because it is essentially based on the "greater fool" theory.  Ie, the bitcoin price is rising, therefore I should hold onto my bitcoins and not spend.  The more people that participate in this "dont spend, hoarde" thinking, the higher the bitcoin price goes.  However, this is a bubble not an efficient market.  As soon as the thinking changes to "cash in now while the price is high", the price starts to move back down, and then all of the hoarders see the price falling and rush to cash in on the high prices.  The effect is *inflation* as all the hoarded money floods the economy due to the rapid inflation.  This type of inefficient pricing will tend to keep itself in check and the price will tend to remain at an efficient supply/demand ratio.
Inflation is *much* better than inflation since
a) it's easier to save
b) employees don't have to push for pay rises - rather the onus is on the employers to try to push pay decreases, so this favours workers.
c) income tax thresholds will, if unchanged, mean income tax % falls due to falling wages.  it's up to governments to try to move tax brackets lower (hence tax % higher) rather than the inflationary scenario where our rising wages mean we are automatically paying more tax without the government having to do anything, and then they look like heroes when they raise the tax bracket levels.

I agree that it would be good to talk in satoshis.  This would give us a current exchange rate of about 160K satoshis per $1.  There are lots of currencies that have high units like this, eg. 21K vietnamese dong = $1.  Over time the deflation would make the numbers get smaller and smaller.
I think it's less confusing than having to learn a new unit every year and having to remember the conversion rate between different units.

There is no monetary deflation in bitcoin.  There is initial inflation which levels off and eventually the supply becomes fixed at 21M.  You're referring to "price deflation" which is dependent on the market price of bitcoin, which is completely outside the scope of the paper.

The blockchain only grows linearly.  As in, to double the blockchain size requires double the transactions.  Of course, during this initial rampup period before bitcoin matures, there could be exponential growth in the number of transactions occuring per block, but long term this will reach a point where the growth in transactions is no longer exponential (it could even be flat) at which point the blockchain grows linearly.  Storage capacity, on the other hand, follows moore's law and grows exponentially.  Therefore, it's only a matter of time until the whole blockchain can fit on a tiny thumb drive.  There may be several decades where the blockchain is way too big to store for everyday people, due to the popularity of bitcoin growing faster than storage growth, but eventually the exponential growth in storage will catch up to the eventually-linear growth of transactions.


Bitcoins being more expensive will just make them more desirable.  Of course, a single bitcoin will be out of reach for most people (in fact, there can only be at most 21 million people who have 1 bitcoin), so 1 bitcoin will just be this huge figure of wealth like when people talk about "1 million dollars" without having it.  Day to day transactions would occur in some smaller unit and wallets can be patched to show balances in these smaller units.


There are proposals in the works to implement this kind of system.  See 
Luckily, bitcoin has a built-in scripting language so that transactions can be programmed to require certain pre-requisites to be spent.  There is so much room to innovate in this space.

A merkle tree is a data structure that pre-dates bitcoin.  It's used in bittorrent and other applications as well.  There's a wikipedia page on it: 
The concept with the chain of signatures is showing the coin changing ownership.  So it starts off owned by Owner 1.  It's provably owned by Owner 1 because the previous owner (Owner 0) signed it over to him by making the signature.  Then Owner 1 spends the coin over to Owner 2 by signing Owner 2's public key with his signature.  So the whole thing forms a chain of proof showing that each owner spent the coin by signing it over to the next owner.  The problem here is that it doesn't prevent double spending (eg. Owner 1 could sign 2 copies, one giving it to Owner 2 and another giving it to Owner 4, which would leave both Owner 2 and 4 with valid copies of the coin.  This is where the blockchain comes in, to ensure there is a consensus over the sequence of transactions and no double spending.

An important thing to do is verify the signatures (or at least hashes) of the clients after you download them, to make sure you aren't downloading a hacked wallet.
Personally I like electrum because it's so simple to understand.  I tried multibit once but it seemed more complicated, with multiple directories involved, encrypted and non-encrypted version of the wallet, no obvious way to do backups.  Electrum is great because you just have to write down the seed and then you can delete the wallet file from your computer, giving you an offline wallet.  You can also keep a wallet file on your computer but encrypt it with a strong passphrase so that it doesn't matter if the file is stolen.
SPV is still pretty strong.  I think the main risk is that you have to trust the server to not be hiding a double spend.  A thin client can still verify any transaction in the blockchain with strong confidence, so once a transaction is confirmed once then you know it wasn't a double spend.

Bitcoins themselves don't have a physical or even digital representation.  The bitcoin network really just consists of transactions which track the number of bitcoins being sent from one address to another.  A transaction is a way of spending a previous transaction (one that was sent to you), and paying someone else with it.  Once that transaction is in the block chain, then the recipient has an unspent transaction which they can spend.
Transactions contain detail of the number of bitcoins being spent (inputs) and where they are being sent to (outputs) - so that is the closest thing to what actual bitcoins are.
Furthermore, no one really "owns" unspent transactions - what they own is the private key, which they keep to themselves.  The private key has a digital representation.  This allows the spender to prove to the rest of the network that they have the ability to spend the unspent transaction, ie. they 'claim' the unspent output.

Thats interesting.  Does the multibit server actually provide the raw transaction to the client?  Because if so, couldn't the user then technically submit the transaction to the network to make the payment occur?

It has been a normal part of economies forever until recent decades when the paradigm changed to permanent inflation/growth which has left us where we are today: 
Growth phase = lots of innovation and entrepreneurialism.  Contraction phase = inefficient companies go bankrupt and so resources and labour is freed up to move to more productive areas.
Permanent growth means inefficiently allocated capital stays misallocated and never gets cleaned up, so the economy becomes inefficient and uncompetitive.

Your expected returns don't diminish every day, they only diminish each 2016 blocks, or, lets say 10 days assuming the hashrate is growing.  During each 10 day window you're either going to perform above average or below average, and over time your luck will even out.  It does mean that your luck early on will matter more than your luck later on, for some given mining hardware, but if you're keeping your rigs upgraded then the bias will even itself out over time as well as some will have lucky early performance and some will have unlucky early performance.

I think it will take a combination of things:
1) Bitcoin must become much more user friendly.  Non technical people need to be able to use it and see the benefits, without needing to know about public/private key crypto, blockchain, wallet security etc.  Hopefully the venture capital continues to drive new innovation, leading to breakthroughs in the simplicity of obtaining, storing, and spending bitcoins.
2) There needs to be mainstream trust in bitcoin.  Some reputable famous people speaking positively about it will help its image.  At the moment there are a lot of haters who don't trust it and think it is a ponzi scheme or has some fatal flaws.  When everyday people first hear about bitcoin, they are very skeptical and tend to think it is a scam.  Hopefully with time, positive word will spread.
3) The global central banking ponzi scheme needs to collapse.  Logic would say this is inevitable, but the question is how long the can-kicking can continue for before the market collapses.  Once this happens, and there is a flight out of bonds into hard assets, all asset prices will rise (I'm assuming a hyper-inflationary end game).  At this point, if points  and  above are covered, then this will open the door for a huge transfer of wealth into bitcoins, due to their gold-like properties but with added features (easier to move across borders, easier to securely store, easier to use for payments).  This could send the price to $100k (in today's dollars).

Check blockchain.info to make sure the transaction has actually been confirmed.  Then double check that the receiving address is actually the correct address from your wallet.  If it's confirmed and the right address, make sure your client is in sync with the latest blocks.  If that all looks right and you still don't see the transaction in your wallet, then relaunch bitcoin-qt with the -rescan option to do a full rescan of the blockchain and see if that fixes it.

I think you should just run the calculations and work out what suits your risk profile.  Personally I find a lot of the comments on here to be overly conservative.  I've taken a more aggressive approach because I am a firm believer and if bitcoin goes where I think it's going, I want to be set up for life.  I'm willing to lose a big chunk of my net worth if I'm wrong, because I see this as such a huge opportunity.  10% of your income sounds fine, especially since it sounds like your earn decent money and have plenty of discretionary income already.

The conclusions drawn seem a bit questionable.  They are modelling the blockchain as a graph, with addresses as nodes and transactions as edges.  However, most individuals do not re-use addresses, whereas businesses tend to re-use addresses.  I think the findings just show that those addresses which were re-used in the past, are getting re-used even more now, which makes sense because the bitcoin economy is growing and businesses are getting doing more bitcoin transactions.

Why did they tumble them all back to a single address?  It makes it really easy to spot a new address with 96,000 coins.  They need to send small chunks at a time into the tumbler, and have them output to multiple addresses.  I imagine that would be pretty difficult to track.  Unless the thief needs 96,000 clean bitcoins tomorrow, they shouldn't bother trying to tumble them all at once.

FYI, the "leading zeros" thing isn't entirely accurate.  If difficulty were determined by leading zeros, then the smallest difficulty increase would be doubling (1 more leading 0 would make it twice as difficult to find blocks).  The actual way it works is that there is a difficulty target, which is a number that the hash must be lower than.  The target does not have to be a power of 2.  This allows difficulty to be fine tuned and be adjusted by small factors as required.

I believe spending will continue to grow more and more and the price goes up.  This is in contrast to all the textbook economists who think this is impossible.
There are people sitting on thousands of coins, and its my hunch that a lot of people fear trying to sell these through an exchange.  What is your bank going to do when you suddenly get a $1M deposit from a bitcoin exchange?  Possibly freeze it and investigate it for fraud.  Also you have to worry about your exchange account getting hacked, or withdrawal delays.  Plus, you have to go through the stress of trying to dump the coins without spooking the market.  It such an easier exit strategy to spend the coins at market price, and let BitPay handle the exchange side.
I can just imagine people with millions worth of bitcoins seeing the news about a Lamborghini dealership accepting bitcoins, and being like "fuck it, I'm buying a Gallardo", and while they're at it, book some flights and hotels with bitcoins and go enjoy a holiday.  No dealing with banks involved :D

Except how do you know that you get clean coins back from the exchange in step 5?  You could be receiving red or pink coins if the exchange accepts red/pink coins.  When you go to spend them, you could be refused business because of the taint, and you could be asked to explain where you got the coins, and have to give them all the details about the exchange etc.
If you've got clean coins, hold on to them, don't tumble them because you could get back tainted coins.

No it's not ironic.  Satoshi designed bitcoin itself to be a strong and stable system, which it is.  The market for exchanging fiat for BTC has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  That's like saying the Nissan GTR has a design flaw if resale prices are fluctuating due to see-sawing sentiment and speculation.  You have to see the market as separate to the actual thing being traded.
Here's a quote from Satoshi:
*"Indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.*
*"In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value."*

I agree with your points on why litecoin is way behind bitcoin, but I don't agree that it costs more to secure.  That's a bit of a tail-wags-dog argument.  There isn't a cost to secure bitcoin or litecoin, but rather the security emerges as a consequence of the cost of attack.  The higher the cost of a 51% attack, the more secure the network is.  If you were to lower the memory requirements for scrypt, this benefit goes to both the attackers and the honest parties, so no one benefits.  It will just result in a higher hash rate per $ invested for everyone involved.  It's a level playing field.

First you need to understand some concepts, particular the blockchain, because if you understand the blockchain then you basically understand bitcoin.  I'll give a simplified explanation of some concepts:
Transaction: a transaction is a payment from one person to another, for some number of bitcoins.  Eg, when someone gives you bitcoins, they create a transaction, sign it, and send it to the bitcoin network.  When a transaction is first sent, it will initially be "unconfirmed" until it is mined into a block.
Block: Blocks are created by miners.  They contain a whole bunch of transactions that were unconfirmed.  Blocks are difficult to create since they have a mathematical proof-of-work built in, which is why blocks are only created once every 10 minutes on average, and whoever mines the block is rewarded 25 bitcoins.
Blockchain: A block contains a reference to the previous block that came before it, and so they link together to form a chain:
[Block 1]&lt;---[Block 2]&lt;---[Block 3]&lt;----[Block 4]...etc
Collectively they form a chain, known as the blockchain.  The blockchain provides a chronological history of all transactions.  As mentioned, the blockchain is constantly growing longer at a controlled rate.  Once your transaction gets into a block, it has 1 confirmation, and then each time a new block is added on top, that's an additional confirmation.  After 6 confirmations you can be quite sure that a transaction is irreversible, but the confirmations will never stop growing since the blockchain never stops growing.
There is a website which provides more data on the blockchain here:    On the front page you can see the latest blocks, and if you click on them you'll see all the transactions that are in those blocks.


There is a reddit tip bot but that operates outside of bitcoin itself.  It tracks tip balances, and only when you withdraw tips will it result in an actual bitcoin transaction.  If you're referring to a payment that came into your bitcoin wallet, you can look up the transaction ID on blockchain.info to get more details on where the coins came from, but you will only be able to trace it to bitcoin addresses with are semi-anonymous, so unless you know who owns that address then you won't know who sent the money.

Your return will be 0, because it takes you 9 hours to do 1 hash.  Even when one of these hashes happens to meet the pool's PoW target, it will be stale by the time you submit it.

The market won't move to a new coin overnight.  Any new rival would have to follow a similar growth path that bitcoin did.  Starting off as a small project, being worth a few cents per coin, growing and maybe reaching $1, etc etc.  Once there is trust in the new currency, and the network strength grew, it might eventually overtake bitcoin, and then maybe it would take years for bitcoin to fully fade out.  Investors would have plenty of time to move between the two and/or diversify.
I don't see this happening though until something equally revolutionary comes along.  What's going to be better than bitcoin?

Money in circulation still adds to demand, even if it's bought and sold quickly.  Like, say on average, it takes 1 day for the cycle of buying the coins, sending to the seller, then the seller liquidating the coins.  If silk road is doing $1B per year then this means $2.7M of coins on hand for buyers/sellers at any given moment.  Same with the remittence business - they might buy and sell within minutes, but if you add up all the transactions that are currently taking place, those are all coins taken off the market for those minutes.  Same if all the bitcoin spenders have a few $ worth of BTC on hand for their weekly expenses.  Also if you're a merchant, even if you liquidate your bitcoin revenues daily (like a bitpay kind of thing), every merchant will have a small amount of coins on hand before selling.  Once the bitcoin economy takes off, adding all these little amounts up should be quite a significant portion of demand.

The gold standard ended because governments wanted to be able to print money out of thin air to finance their agendas.  This printing doesn't create new wealth, it just steals it from savers.  The gold standard is an honest system that doesn't allow such theft.
The price movements you describe is called a market.  It happens in every tradeable commodity in existence.  Some are more volatile than others.  Of course BTC is volatile now - it's highly speculative new currency which is based on a whole new paradigm.  It's in its infancy, and the market cap reflects this.  Expect a whole lot more volatility before it becomes mature.  If you can't handle that, then don't buy bitcoins.
BTW your cash is so "stable" because you consider it to be your fixed point of reference.  Try pricing your dollars in gold grams and see how they've performed over the last few decades - anything but stable.  Everything is relative.

You could consider doing what the physical bitcoin manufacturers do, which is make them in limited batches so they are collectors items.  If they were numbered, and after 1000 of them you moved on to a 2.0 design, then it adds more specialness to it and it might convince people to pay that bit extra.  (although unlike physical coins, resale isn't very possible since each unit is customised to that person's address).  Probably a silly idea but I thought I'd throw it out there.

Do hash functions really belong in class NP?  I thought that NP problems had to be brute-force solvable and the solution must be polynomial in the size of the input.  Since hash functions take an unlimited input size, and map to a fixed output size, reversing this could have a solution thats non-polyomial size (although they are statistically 'likely' to find a smaller solution).  In other words, a non-deterministic turing machine is not guaranteed to find a pre-image in polynomial time, because the smallest pre-image could potentially be way larger than the hash, for some particular hashes.
Edit: fixed up definition of NP

Yes, it's not a spiral with Bitcoin.  It's only a spiral when there's debt involved.
Here's the spiral:
Deflation =&gt; debt goes up in real terms =&gt; higher % of income directed at paying down debt =&gt; less money in circulation =&gt; further deflation.
Without the debt, there's no spiral.  People get richer as the price goes up, thus spending increases in real terms.
There is certainly no significant amount of borrowed bitcoin that I know of.  I'd say less than 1% of BTC wealth is borrowed.  Compare that to the amount of leverage that led to the Great Depression.. which is often used as an example of a deflationary spiral.

If you knew that you were a top target of powerful authorities, with big resources at their disposal for tracking you, then perhaps a savvy technical person would be able to do a pretty good job of exercising the right level of paranoia and concealing their identity online.  However, if you are not on anyone's radar, and you just have a pie-in-the-sky idea you want to start like DPR did, one could imagine that concealing your tracks wouldn't necessarily be  on your priority list, compared to actually getting your idea off the ground.  If DPR had a crystal ball early on, I'm sure he wouldn't have been stupid enough to recruit people on a forum using his personal name.
That's what sets Satoshi apart.  Satoshi had the foresight to act as if everyone was trying to find him out, even before it was happening.  Then he disappeared before any powerful adversaries had him on their radar.  He must have really believed 100% that Bitcoin would be huge.

I don't think the block chain size problem is a problem long term. Right now the growth of the blockchain appears exponential, but ultimately it can be upper bounded with a linear function, whereas computer storage capacity grows exponentially.  Meaning that, over time, the size of the blockchain will become insignificant.
Consider for simplicity's sake that the blockchain size can be defined as:
BS = T * A;
(BS = blockchain size, T = average number of transactions per day, A = age of block chain).
Well we know that age will grow linearly.  So then we look at transactions per day.  This can be further broken down as:
T = P * E;
(P = adoption of bitcoin, E = economic activity)
P: if bitcoin adoption continues growing exponentially, the growth will have to stop when every single person is using it.  at this point the adoption would only grow with global population growth (which has been exponential to date but far less so than at moore's law rates, and presumably will eventually have to stop due to a finite planet).
E: this is debateable, but I think it's become pretty obvious that we can't have exponential growth in wealth forever.  not on a finite planet.  this figure could grow fast though if we have an explosion in automated micro-payments, but if we just consider current transaction habits then this should not have exponential growth.
So after a sufficient number of years, the block chain size should be limited to a linear growth, even if early on it grows exponentially until it matures.
Storage capacity, on the other hand, continues to grow exponentially and I don't think there are any signs that this will have to slow down? (someone correct me if I'm wrong).
So in conclusion, the blockchain size will eventually become insignificant, but it could take several decades or more before this happens.

Actually, my last attempt was way too mathematical and not suitable for a 5 year old.  I think the way a kid would understand it is to just ignore the technical "how" and focus on the "what".  Try this:
- The bitcoin network records transactions in a "block chain".  Each block contains a list of transactions that have occured since the last block.  The chain has a new block added roughly every 10 minutes.
- Miners have mining machines that try to make blocks, by taking all the new transactions and attempting to build a block with them.  When a miner successfully makes a block, he/she will add it to the end of the block chain, and will receive a reward for doing so (currently 25 bitcoins).
- Blocks are deliberately hard to make, so that they are only made every 10 minutes on average.  The more powerful the mining machine, the faster it will make blocks.
- As the mining machines get more powerful, the bitcoin network automatically makes it harder to find blocks, to control the speed at which new blocks are made.

You should decide between a deterministic or non-deterministic wallet.  If you're going non-deterministic, I would recommend the bitcoin-qt client.  If you want confidence in your wallet, go with that one that is built and maintained by the bitcoin core dev team and worked on by satoshi and all the other great bitcoin devs.
Technically you don't need to sync it with the blockchain in order to generate a wallet, make some addresses, and back it up.  However, you will need to sync the wallet later when you go to spend the coins (and possibly do a rescan if it doesn't detect them after syncing).

"Illegal" only applies in the context of a given jurisdiction.  As we all know, bitcoin transcends nation states and jurisdictions.  It's universal.  To dismiss it as "illegal" is very ignorant.  It may be illegal in some country, but not another.  Anyway, I haven't heard of it being illegal anywhere yet.

It's a common misconception that miners are finding proof that transactions are valid.  Actually the only proof they are providing is proof that they burnt a whole lot of processor cycles (well it's not even proof, but it's "with high probability" that they did a lot of work to find a suitable block header).  That's why it's called proof-of-work.  The verification of transactions is done by each and every full node on the bitcoin network.  So all the people who aren't mining are still checking every transaction and every signature, and will reject any invalid blocks.
A miner could provide perfectly valid proof-of-work on a block containing double spends, invalid signatures, incorrect coinbase reward, etc, but no one will accept it into their chain.
TLDR: miners aren't trusted to "verify" transactions, they simply make it extremely hard to add new blocks to the blockchain, ensuring that the blockchain is democratised on a vote-by-processing-power type of system, but they still need to play by everyone's rules if they want their block accepted.

You can only spend from an address one time for every payment received to it.  The two are equal.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:11:59
Yes mate that's totally normal.  Transactions consist of 'inputs' and 'outputs'.  That transaction has 2 outputs, one going to your address (0.5btc) and another going back to one of the seller's own addresses.  Now the 0.5 btc output is yours to spend assuming you possess the private key for that address.  So, if you wish to pay someone 0.1 btc you will input the 0.5 and output a 0.1 payment to them and 0.4 to yourself.  Wallet software does this all automatically (called change addresses) so you don't have to worry too much about it.  Your wallet will choose whatever spendable inputs seem appropriate and will create new change addresses automatically.
You can also combine multiple spendable inputs into a transaction in order to spend them all at once.

Living in a bubble implies you are sealed off from reality, living in your own sheltered little world.  The reality is that gold coins have been minted for thousands of years, and civilisations have depended on them for just as long.  Gold is an integral part of human history.  Only mere decades ago, gold was used to settle all international trade (see Bretton Woods).  Still to this day, central banks hold huge gold reserves, and currently they are building up their stockpiles rapidly.  If you think china is going crazy for Bitcoin, just look at their gold apetite.  Gold is very much a part of the real world, and will very likely return to play an important role in the monetary future once the 40 year fiat currency experiment inevitably ends.  Smart people know this.
To pretend like gold coins are some obscure thing no one has ever used, is total ignorance.

OK so your android phone currently holds the private keys required to spend your coins.  Make sure your phone doesn't get hacked or stolen because they could take your coins.  The backup feature is asking for a password because it will use that password as a key to encrypt your wallet file.  If you store the encrypted wallet backup somewhere (like in your email or on another computer), then you can use it later if your phone is stolen/destroyed to recover the wallet (but this will NOT save you if the thief has already spent your coins).
I wouldn't recommend to store any serious amount of money on your phone though.  Not any more than you would normally carry in your wallet.  If you're talking thousands of $$, store it offline.  Get one of the main wallets like armory, electrum, multibit, bitcoin-qt, etc and read up on how to securely generate an offline wallet.  Don't use a "brainwallet" though as those are often not secure.
Once you've got a secure offline wallet, send the coins from your phone to the new wallet and you'll be safe.  Then in future when you buy more coins, withdraw them to the offline wallet.

No, they didn't poof into existance.  All bitcoins ever mined have an amount of provable work that went into mining them.  You can't just "poof" them without doing this amount of work.  Currently that amount of work is so high, that it would probably take you billions of years to do it on your computer.  So, mess around with the code all you like, but if you actually study how the system works you'll see that your efforts will be futile.  Bitcoins are currently worth a total of $3 billion, do you really think no genius has been motivated to break it for their own financial gain?
Your assumption that the original developer has any special control over anything is completely wrong too.  Bitcoin is like letting a genie out of a bottle - it's been opened - and now no one, not even the developers, can stop it.  The people own it now.

It's irrelevant what the hash rate is per $ invested.  The important thing is that 50% of the hash power must be honest nodes.  Regardless of how cost effective scrypt mining is, an attacker would have to invest more money than all the honest nodes combined, just like with bitcoin.  Since all parties face the same costs, it makes no difference.

There is no transaction message.  Are you talking about the blockchain.info service?  That's not part of the actual blockchain, so is not protected by proof-of-work.  Any blockchain staff could add/remove/modify one of the messages retrospectively at any point.  However you can add additional data within your transaction script, but this requires making a raw transaction.  So it is possible, just not with any standard bitcoin wallet software.
Also, photos with newspapers aren't a solution either, because they only prove recency of a photo, not age.

That's not how it works.  Firstly, people don't increase their transaction fees to raise mining difficulty.  People want to pay as little fees as they can to get into a block, so fees will be an equilibrium price for supply/demand of block space.
Secondly, miners are well aware of any upcoming drop in reward and they factor this into their profit projections, and invest in mining equipment accordingly.  Mining hardware becomes out of date in a matter of months, so they are always making new purchases if they want to stay in the mining game.  Therefore, there won't be a sudden 90% drop in hash power when reward drops.  Take a look at the last reward drop for an example.

Your mistake is that you think bitcoin's value can rise forever.  There is a ceiling around $1M per BTC (in today's dollars) whereby we surpass the USD and become a global reserve currency.  It can't keep going higher than that because there wouldn't be enough dollars or anything else to price it any higher.
To get to that point we only need 3 more 10x gains.  If you consider it started at 1 cent, then we've already gone through 5 10x gains.  It's survived 5 of these 10x moves already, so why can't it survive the last 1, 2 or 3?  Once it hits a limit, people *have* to spend it because there's no higher that it can go.
That's assuming your hoarding theory is even correct.  The facts actually show that bitcoin spending is currently at record levels (in terms of real economic value - goods &amp; services purchased), and it will likely keep breaking records as we continue on our way up.

No, livestock isn't durable (it dies), nor fungible (one cow does not equal another cow).  Bonds are just a promissory note, they are in IOU for money or currency.  IOUs don't have intrinsic value, and they can be issued in infinite quantities so they are not sufficiently rare nor durable or fungible.  Same with stocks, they represent a share in a company and are hinged to that company's future earnings.  A stock's value comes extrinsically from the fact that you expect to receive a dividend cheque in the mail (for currency) each quarter if the company earns a profit.

When I first heard about Bitcoin, I worried that it didn't have intrinsic value because anyone could clone the project and create an alternate block chain (in that sense it's not really like gold).  Well now that it has been done, my fears are no more.  It turns out that this isn't such a threat, and Bitcoin does have intrinsic value, because what gives Bitcoin its value is the strength and size of its network and user base.  Anyone can create an alt coin, but it's worthless unless others are interested in it.  Bitcoin is where the innovation originally came from and where it still comes from.  Bitcoin is miles ahead of alt coins in terms of market cap, popularity, network strength, real economy (products &amp; services), trading volume, wallet software.  Also, from my non-expert opinion, bitcoin seems to have the top development talent focused on it.  The other projects just wait for bitcoin releases and rebase their patches on to it.
So alt coins are good in that they take one of the bitcoiners worst fears (dilution of bitcoins value by other projects) and get it out there in the open, so that we can realise that it isn't that scary and isn't such a realistic threat anyway!  It's better than if there were no alt coins and there was uncertainty about what an alt coin would do to bitcoin.

OP is spot on.   Coin taining is built into bitcoins.  Each of our transactions are already tainted.

Those who are fighting taining are really just asking people to please ignore the reality that bitcoin fungibility is questionable by design.

It's "verifying transactions?".  Yeah right, verifying transactions means checking the signatures are valid and making sure that the inputs are unspent.  None of which is done by ASICs.  They are just being fed block headers, and incrementing the nonce fields in attempt to find a hash below a target value.  People like to say they're "verifying transactions" because it makes it sounds like the power isn't going to waste. The truth is that they're doing work for the sake of work.  It creates security because an attacker would need to do a greater amount of work to rewrite the chain.

This might be a weird opinion, but I think trading is *more* greedy than holding, because you are trying to make even more profit than bitcoin is already going to make you.  I am very confident that bitcoin is going over $1k, in fact I think it will go over $10k and beyond.  So I'm satisfied to ride out the volatility and have a safe 5x-50x return on my money, without any risk of losing it through my own stupid trading decisions.
So you're either saying that 50x return over a few years is not good enough, or you're not a believer in bitcoin.

Wallets generate addresses randomly from a very large space.  (2^160 addresses).  There are so many possibilities that it's basically impossible that someone can also generate the same key.
You can't modify your wallet to give yourself more bitcoins, because your wallet doesn't store your balance, the blockchain does.  The blockchain is very hard to write to, and even if you did, it would have to be a valid record, else it would be rejected by the rest of the network.  Valid meaning that the coins either came from being mined or being spent to you with a valid signature, from someone who had coins.

Everyone seems to make the same mistake of investing in mining instead of just buying coins.  Sure, you'll have fun, but you won't get the same number of coins that you would do if you just bought coins outright with your cash instead of purchasing mining gear.  If you're at the top of the mining chain, you'll profit (like ASIC Miner), but if you're just a retail miner then you're going to spend more BTC than you'll mine back, unless you get really lucky.
Bitcoins are getting nearly impossible to mine for most people, and yet they are still so easy to purchase.  You can pull a $100 note out of your pocket and buy a bitcoin.  That's a lot easier than spending months mining.  Save some money by skipping a night out and spend it on BTC.  Focus on cutting your expenses so you free up cash for coin purchases.  This will net you more coins that your mining gear will..

Bitcoin isn't built around trust, it's built around *no trust*.  You'll see this mentioned all through Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper.
The issue of which person owns which address is external to bitcoin, but Snowden could publish a GPG key and then sign a message detailing his bitcoin addresses.  (to verify the GPG key would either require some kind of proof from snowden or using web-of-trust, but again this is outside the realm of bitcoin).

You should buy gold, silver, AND bitcoin.  Don't put all of your eggs in one basket.  Bitcoin is more volatile and has a more uncertain future than gold and silver, so putting a majority into gold/silver would make sense if you are wanting to manage risk.  If you can tolerate wild volatility and afford to lose everything, then pile everything into bitcoin.  Why not also consider other asset classes like stocks (eg. even just putting 20% into an index fund with low fees).

It's more about the user than the OS.  Don't do anything stupid like download untrusted software off of the internet, or run mysterious java applets on websites.  Don't run software that's known to have a bad history of exploits.  If you want to run something that could potentially be insecure, run it in a VM.  If you notice something weird, like some new adware toolbar in your browser, then realise that you've got malware and that your computer OS is now unsafe.


So the keyspace should be around 72^18.  log2(72^18) = 111 bits of entropy, which is beyond brute forceable (providing that the passwords are random, not ones you made up).


Different clients have their own wallet format so one wallet file is not necessarily going to be portable to other clients.  The wallet file holds the private keys to all of your bitcoin addresses, so you need to protect it with a strong passphrase.


That sounds sensible, but perhaps consider diversifying so that not all your coins are in one place with one password.

This is the part that's wrong.  If you release your block in reaction to seeing an honest block, there isn't a "toss up" - miners work to extend the *first* block they see if there are two competing forks.  It's in satoshi's paper and is also implemented in the code.  The selfish strategy relies on being able to propogate their block faster than the honest block, even though the honest block has a head start since it was broadcast first.  This is where they claim they could do a sybil attack by having low-latency, high-bandwidth connections to many nodes.  If they can't pull this off with a high rate of success, the strategy fails badly.

With problems like travelling salesman, there are a finite set of possible solutions for a given problem instance.  This makes it brute forceable which puts it in family NP.  With a hash function, since there's no known way to reverse it, you have to brute force the input space but the input space is infinite.  Although it's extremely likely that you'll find a solution smaller than 264 bits, it's yet to be proven that there isn't some hash with a smallest preimage thats some epic size, or possibly there some hash with no preimage at all.  Thats why I question whether something like reversing SHA-256 can actually be put in class NP.
Edit: in fact, an algorithm to reverse sha256 would simply be hashing all inputs from 0 through to infinity until it finds a pre-image, so no analysis could put an upper bound on this.  It would have a "probabilistic" upper bound but not an actual real provable bound.

It's a bad idea to transact by passing around private keys.  Use the blockchain for transactions.  It's how bitcoin was designed.
You can't be serious that they'd buy the paper back off of you.  That makes no sense.  a) they could still have a copy of the priv key anyway, so wouldn't need the paper, b) you could sell them the paper and then imeediately send the bitcoins to another address, making the privkey worthless (and they would be unable to prove that it was you who stole the coins).

What he said is kind of right though.  All that's required in a software update and we could allow the block reward to go back to 50 or more per block, and you could even lift the 21M limit.
At some point in the future, if miners get greedy, they could decide shift to a new fork that does this.  Who knows what the fallout would and whether such a movement could ever get enough support to cause a serious fork.  But, it really is just as easy as changing the algorithm and recompiling, provided that a majority of users are willing to install the update.

It's pretty easy to disprove this theory by looking at what's happening right now with bitcoin.  There is a lot of innovation taking place, investments of peoples time and money, to build bitcoin businesses.  These investors are betting on bitcoin having a meteoric rise - its what they are hoping for and believe will happen.  This is your "hyperdeflation" case and is in fact exactly what the entrepreneurs are hoping for.
Put it this way - if you're some payment processing company and you're handling 10% of all bitcoin merchant transactions.  Let's say that's $500M revenue per year right now.  Then lets say bitcoin use grows 100 fold and so now bitcoin prices are 1/100th smaller ("hyperdeflation").  Assuming they maintained their market share, that bitcoin merchant is now doing $50B in revenues.  I'm using dollars as an example here to represent value, but you can substitute it for anything (ie. gold, oil, labour, food, property, whatever).
If you're using the word "deflation" to describe changes in the money base, then bitcoin is in fact inflationary until 21M and then becomes stable.  It's not deflationary.  If you're referring deflation meaning prices dropping, then this represents the *success* of bitcoin since more and more value is being placed on it by people who choose to use it.  It's a necessary condition of bitcoin succeeding.  So BTC price deflation means exactly that bitcoin is successful.  Every time BTC prices drop, this signals that more people, more wealth, is putting trust in bitcoin.
Remember bitcoin is not being forced on anyone.  It's not like government money where you don't have a choice to use it.  If bitcoin prices suffer "hyperdeflation" it's because there is huge growth in the number of people who *choose* to use it as a store of wealth and to do commerce.  It's a contradiction to say that "success means failure and therefore bitcoin cannot succeed", since this has already been disproven by its success to date, and it's more popular than ever even after suffering extreme "hyperdeflation" from below $2 to $120.

As I understand it, orphan blocks would still count towards the PoW in a subtree, so the work isn't wasted in terms of securing the network.  However, the work is still wasted in terms of profitability, since the orphan blocks don't yield any reward.  So, wouldn't it still be the case that miners are incentivised to try to get their block into the main chain, which means they will want to keep block sizes small to speed up propogation times?

Breaking ECDSA (by factoring integers efficiently) alone doesn't mean you can steal anyone's bitcoins.  Bitcoin addresses are *hashes* of public keys, protected by both SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160.  So, without a pre-image attack on these hash functions, you don't even know what public key you need to be factoring.
(note: this assumes the user is sensible and spends all outputs from an address at once, to avoid leaving unspent outputs with a known public key).

I think the argument presented here is a little weak.  It's like if you said that USD counterfeiters should have no incentive to counterfeit because it destroys the value of USD thus undermining their investment.  The reason they still do it is because they benefit more from the malicious act than they lose.  The loss is shared by everyone, but the gains are kept all to themself.  It's called "tragedy of the commons".
However, I agree with chalash's post that withholding blocks simply is not profitable (without a theoretical sybil attack that succeeds with high probability, which has not been demonstrated to be possible).

Yet, the charges from the FBI state that he wired $80K to an undercover agent posing as a hit man, and also say that he was paying salaries to staff (between $1000 and $2000 per week).  He was also paying for servers and ordering fake IDs.  Who knows what other deals he was doing with his BTC.  Plus, much of this spending would have occured when bitcoin was worth $30 and under, so the amount of BTC spent would have been higher than with today's prices.

I'm not sure about this idea that if Miner Bob increases his hashing power, it encourages Miner Jim to do the same, thus providing a feedback loop which should discourage Bob to ever increase in the first place.  For example, consider the opposite scenario where Bob opts not to increase his hash rate.  Now if Jim were to purchase new equipment exactly as he did in the first scenario, he would actually be *better off* than in the first scenario where Bob did increase.  So, this actually provides a counter example to say that if Bob increases his hash rate, it should actually *discourage* others to increase theirs, since their investment will now yield less than it would have under the lower difficulty.

Money is simply a utility which functions as a durable, fungible store of wealth to facilitate easy commerce.  Money does not contain labour, and hoarding money does not hold any labour to ransom, in the same way that printing money does not create prosperity.  A growth in the supply of money will see prices go up, as we have seen in the fiat world.  In constrast, spreading a fixed money supply over more goods/commerce will result in prices going down (as we have seen with BTC).  So money will function under both conditions - the only difference is the long term effect on savers.
What is often called "hoarding" is actually traditionally called "saving" and it's what good economies are built upon.  Inflation punishes savers and so prosperity declines long-term.  Saving allows middle class people to build wealth and use it to start businesses and invest in the future.
I think that this notion that "spending money as soon as you get it" creates prosperity is false.  It encourages misallocation of capital (spending your money on frivilous things because if you don't spend it, it'll be worthless soon).
Look into the past and you'll see that all good economies were built on a solid base of saving.  Inflation erases savings.

Once again, this is all possible offline and the scenario I presented is valid.

Sure.. well since the last 11 blocks are in the past, your new blocks are going to have a greater timestamp, and your blocks timestamps will even be in perfect order since they come from the same clock, so this requirement is met.


Yes, this says that you won't accept blocks that are timestamped more than 2 hours in the **future**.  Notice the words "less than"?

OK but this is avoiding bitcoin's major design feature (no trust, highly secure transactions), and instead doing a trust-based transaction that also exposes you to other risks:
- Transaction is not recorded in the blockchain, therefore no strong unmodifiable proof that the transaction took place (complicates disputes).
- Disputes are far more likely to happen due to the fact that both parties have the ability to spend the coins.  Therefore you're falling back on personal trust.  Disputes will be difficult or impossible to resolve due to the inability to prove which party made the spend.
- People who buy the paper and don't transfer the coins immediately (such as yourself) have a prolonged exposure to risk.  Down the track, this company could sweep all their private keys and again you would have no recourse to prove they did it.
- Importing compromised private keys into your wallet is a risky practice.  Inexperienced users may end up adding the file to their main wallet which could use the address as a change output, or may confuse the user into re-using the address to receive another payment.  This could mean you could potentially lose even more coins than you purchased.
- Any transmission of a private key (sending it over the internet, or driving it around in a car) is just unnecessary risk.  Keep your private keys private and secure. Trade using public keys.
Satoshi gave you a cryptographically-sound, difficult-to-reverse blockchain to free you from the need to trust counter-parties.  If you want to fall back to trading bits of paper outside the blockchain, then you might as well just stick with fiat.

I'm referring to BTC return.  You stated that bringing extra miners online raises difficulty which means your net return is 0.  That statement is not true if you have below 100% network hashrate.  This is unequivocal fact.
The discussion about potential bitcoin prices, and the interaction between price and concentration of mining power, is pure speculation.  Whilst people might have an opinion about that, it's completely unpredictable.  If ASIC had 99% of the hashrate, I don't think BTC would be anywhere near $0.  I'd certainly be buying if they dropped that much.

Privacy as well as security.  When you spend from an address you reveal your public key, so you instantly lose the security of SHA-256 / RIPEMD-160.  An attacker can then exploit the signature if there is a weakness such as this one.

@_date: 2013-08-02 05:54:01
I agree.  The signs are pointing towards mining being dominated by a small number of powerful players who manufacture specialised mining hardware.  They will achieve far greater hashrate efficiency per kilowatt, and will continue to produce more hardware until they reach the equilibrium point for profitability.  At that point, small players won't be profitable and it would take a large investment to start a new mining venture.
What the OP said is true though - the bigger you are, the more you dilute the returns of your existing hardware, so this would provide a ceiling on how big any one miner could grow.  Certainly it would be hard to imagine someone with 90% of network hash rate, doubling their investment only to increase their return by ~5%.

To your first point, it is definitely an issue and I suggest you head on over to bitcointalk.org to read some of the discussion about ways of solving it.  There are different opinions on whether the blockchain will eventually have high fees and only be used for transferring large amounts, with smaller payments pushed to off-blockchain services, or whether it is possible to scale it to handle a high volume of smaller transactions.  The problem with scaling it larger is that mining becomes more centralised since there are less and less full nodes capable of storing the full blockchain and verifying all of the signatures in real time.  Eventually moore's law should keep giving us higher transaction rates, so long as bandwidth, latency, and storage keep improving, but there will probably be a choke point somewhere in the future.
To the second question, snapshots would require us to trust them.  Bitcoin is designed to be trustless, so a node that wants to be trustless would need to see the entire blockchain history to have complete confidence that it is valid.  There is however a file called boostrap.dat which is distributed via bittorrent.  It contains a snapshot of the whole blockchain up until a certain point, which can be downloaded prior to syncing your wallet.  It's a faster way to sync your wallet than pulling all blocks from peers via the bitcoin protocol, but you're still downloading the whole blockchain.

Well, depending on what you believe, central bankers watch gold like a hawk and are have a deliberate agenda to surpress its price to prevent the relative weakening of paper currencies leading to a loss of faith in the fiat money system.  GATA ( have amassed quite a body of evidence to support this.  I'll leave it up to you as to whether you buy into that or not though..


In places like India it's out of control, people are shoving so much into gold that the government is imposing import restrictions to try to protect the rupee.  There is also skyrocketing demand in other parts of asia.  It's not just consumers either.. most of the non-western central banks around are big net buyers of gold right now.  Hard assets are attractive when we have ZIRP everywhere and the printing presses running hot.


We were discussing whether bitcoin is an existential threat to the US dollar.  Market cap was brought up by someone else who was making a point that bitcoin is not big enough to pose a threat.  My response to that is that market cap is not as relevant as other factors like the intrinsic quality and soundness of the money.  The market cap has already gone from $0 to $1B in a few years.  If bitcoin will defeat paper money, then it'll go as high as it needs to to do that.

It finds three different type of prime number chains.  I think they are mostly of theoretical use.  By having such a large number of them in the blockchain, researchers could use this data to find out more about the distribution and frequency of primes and prime chains, which could lead to us learning some more about prime numbers.  Ironically, some breakthroughs from this data could potentially compromise some of the cryptography that these coins are based on.

Of course I've read the paper.  All of those references are exactly what I'm talking about.  The whole point of bitcoin is to do better than the fiat money system which is dependent on trust (trust of governments not to counterfeit; trust of banks to provide a clearing function; etc).  As the paper says, the idea is to eliminate the need for third parties, remove the trust of governments and back it all up with math and proofs.

Then no, I wouldn't pay for that.  Getting back fiat would suck.

I like this article, because they are coming at it from such a different perspective.

The weakest part of your plan is the web wallet part and deterministic key generation.  If your plan works out well then that 5% could turn into 50% and you would be really worried about security at that point.  Get them ultra-secure now.  Make an offline wallet and transfer them there.
Spend some time researching and doing a practice run involving full recovery, with a small transfer (0.01 btc).  Remember that you need to prevent against both theft and loss.

Dude, bitcoin is in its infancy.  As it grows, it attracts entrepreneurs who can profit from solving these problems.  Expect to see multiple hardware wallets in the future.  The best of them will be ultra secure and totally simple and fool-proof to use.
Are you saying that you don't believe it is possible to make an elegant and user-friendly way to keep bitcoins secure?  I disagree because fundamentally the requirements are quite simple:  1) securely generate private keys, 2) securely store the private keys, 3) provide secure signing of transactions 4) provide secure and easy backups/recovery functionality.
Think about all the clunky first generation products, like the first hard-drive MP3 players, and then compare to a modern iPod.  ..and we are only in the alpha stage here.. bitcoin's value has exploded way faster than the ecosystem has been able to keep up with.. so give it a year or so and see where we're at with security.

This sounds like a really interesting idea.  In some ways it sounds like each song would function as a mini pyramid scheme, in that people would want to purchase it early on in hope that later people will purchase from them so that they profit.  However it wouldn't quite be a pure pyramid scheme since some of the demand will come from people who just want to listen to the music.  Also, each song would be like a mini investment, and if you picked the right one you could make some really good money, so in some senses it rewards good taste in music and discovery of undervalued artists.
The bit I'm not sure about is how it works when there are hundreds of peers with the same song, and I do a search for that song, who do I end up buying it off of?  Is it just some random person, or perhaps the person who is closest connected to me in a social way?
This sounds like it will be fun anyway, whether it takes off or not. Maybe it will be a revolution, or perhaps will flop.  It's hard to tell.  But this project demonstrates how much innovation is possible now that we have peer-to-peer payments.  I can't wait to try it!

Well they kind of phrase it like Satoshi tried and failed to make it stable.  But actually the market price of bitcoin is a by-product of its limited supply, which was known all along and was a deliberate design decision.
If we had some central authority who had the power to arbitrarily change the mining reward to increase/decrease supply in response to price fluctuations, I imagine BTC would promptly go to $0 since it would be just as fickle as paper currencies and could be inflated on a whim.
@_date: 2013-08-11 12:43:49
An important rule to follow with bitcoin is to never use an address more than once.  Always generate new addresses to receive new payments and make sure you are using a wallet that sends change to new change addresses.  That way, if you are using a flawed wallet like the ones effected, you wouldn't be as vulnerable to such an attack.

Transactions only contain signatures for the inputs.  You only need to reveal your public key when *spending* from the address. So if you are following best practices you will only reveal your pub key at time of spending, after which the coins are already gone!
@_date: 2013-10-13 01:10:05
How do you make a market out of those kind of transactions though?  They take a long time to clear and may or may not even get completed in the end (like one party could go cold on the deal after the agreement is made).  You couldn't build an order book out of this because each order has its own unique risk and complications.  Hence there's no single market price on localbitcoins, but instead a big spread and not much liquidity.  It doesn't seem like you could readily build a proper market out of those types of transactions.

I like how the regulator guy also came across as a bit bullish on bitcoin.  Like, he said, what if there were million dollar or billion dollar transactions taking place, and mentioned about how they are always looking at where the market is going next.  These are signs that they have done their homework and determined that bitcoin has the potential to grow much bigger.  I know that's what we all believe already, but it's good to have an independent opinion from a regulatory body come to the same conclusion.
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:58:22
It really will depend on how many transactions are occuring in the future, and what block size limit will be in place.  The larger the block size limit, the smaller transaction fees will be, and vice versa.  It will be up to the bitcoin community and developers to decide what the block size limit should be, which should hopefully be set so that we can have enough space to fit all of the necessary transactions to run the bitcoin economy, but small enough that there is some competition for the space to promote fees.

You might need to rethink that.  Deflation was so bad during the great depression because people were highly leveraged.  If you are in debt during deflation, it's suicide because the amount of money you owe goes up and up (in real terms).  This means you need to divert an increasingly larger portion of your income to servicing debt (because wages are falling but debt repayments obligations remain the same), which in turn reduces your spending, which adds to the recession and deflation, hence the "deflationary spiral".  None of this happens without debt - and bitcoin is not a debt-based system.

The Japan example doesn't really compare to something like bitcoin or a gold standard.  Japan's deflation is occuring despite their massive printing of money.  The reason for the deflation is because they are a zombie economy loaded with debt.  Everyone is wanting to de-leverage and pay down debt, hence the tendency for the money supply to shrink (paying off debt = deflation).  However the central bankers want people to keep borrowing more and more so they drop interest rates to 0 or negative, and pump the economy full of freshly printed money.
If japan was left to function without central bank intervention, there would be an epic depression as all debt is paid down.  But then they would emerge debt-free and ready to grow.  But instead they are just being kept alive on a drip of cheap money..
Bitcoin doesn't involve debt.  The rising demand for bitcoins isnt for paying off bitcoin debts, its for rising demand to do business with bitcoins which is a positive thing for the economy.
All fiat currency is created as a LOAN and is owed back to banks.  All bitcoins are created debt-free!

Even if there is only 0.3BTC reward per block, if BTC are valued at $100K in today's dollars, then that's $30K reward per block.  At the moment at $130 price and 25BTC reward it's only $3250, so there will be plenty of incentive for miners to continue building up their hashing power as the BTC price grows.
The main danger to a 51% attack is it network hashing power starts dropping, which means there is spare infrastructure offline which could return to cause problems.  If hashing power keeps moving upwards then I think this signals that new innovation is coming online and racing any efforts to attack the network.
Since the block reward decays so slowly, it gives plenty of time for the BTC price to keep growing which will encourage continued innovation with mining hardware and continued rising in hashing power.

You can start it with -addnode to manually specify an IP.  There's also a list of seed nodes here:   It also uses DNS to find nodes.
In addition, bitcoin nodes pass addresses to eachother.  So as soon as you find one valid node, it can tell you about hundreds of others.  Your client maintains a peers.dat file which can have tens of thousands of peers that it's seen in the past and can retry connecting to.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:16:58
The miners do check them, because they want to make sure they're building valid blocks.  But no one else trusts them that they're valid.  Every node in the bitcoin network checks every transaction in every block.  It's not an overly CPU intensive task - my macbook air does it easy.
Correct, if a miner did build a block with invalid transactions (either because their client was buggy or they're trying to do some hack), then others would reject it and they wouldn't get their reward.

@_date: 2013-06-22 08:44:23
That's a silly comment.  When you buy a mining rig, the whole point is that you'll mine more coins than could be bought for the price of the unit.  There is some very clear analysis that can be done to work out how long until the unit pays itself off, and it's purely based on network difficulty.  Lottery tickets have nothing to do with any of this...
*edit:  PS: the fiat price of bitcoin does not effect the analysis whatsoever, so it doesn't matter if BTC price goes up or down after you purchase.  Both investments (mining rig vs direct BTC purchase) are effected equally by the price of BTC.

Gold is incredibly robust though.  If you break gold apart, you'll see the both parts are made of the same stuff, like a fractal.  There's no complex components.  You can keep breaking it all the way down to the atomic level and it's all exactly the same thing, just atoms of gold.  There is very little you can do to it to destabilise it and stop it from "being gold" (besides pouring Aqua Regia on it, which is like saying "dont delete your private keys").  It can just sit there for thousands of years being gold.
Bitcoin on the other hand is very complex.  It's not just a single atom, it's a worldwide network, it's the blockchain, it's the bitcoind code, it's the mining rigs, etc etc, and it's a living thing, it's constantly evolving with new versions released, miners coming and going.
I'm a bitcoin superbull like most people here - but there is something to be said about simplicity.  Gold is beautiful and robust in its unwavering simplicity.  Plus, it's got 5000 years as money on its side.

But its value is not supported by industrial demand.  If it were only valued for industrial uses, the price would be far lower.  Sure, you can use this to say that gold will never go to zero, that's true, but current gold prices are supported by demand for store-of-wealth, which is supported by the belief that gold holds monetary value.  It is the same form of belief that supports bitcoin, although the difference being that bitcoin doesn't have an "industrial use" floor under it that prevents a 0 price.

The problem with your logic is that you're assuming that it's a certainty that bitcoin will be worth more on date X in the future.  If that were a certainty, the market would actually price this in and would move to that price now.  The current market price captures the risk as well as the hype.  The price is right where it should be.  Your argument relies on the fact that there is all this built-in future value that isn't captured in the price.
I see lots of arguments like this.. "why would I buy something if I can buy it for half the price next week"... well if you're so certain bitcoin will be double in a week's time, go trade it and make lots of money.
If someone wants a house, they will buy a house.  If everyone holds off on any purchases until bitcoin reaches expected price X, then bitcoin will instantly reach price X (since there will be no asks below price X).  The fact that it's not at price X now proves that not everyone carries the same price expectations as you.  The market, right now, proves that the equilibrium between hoarders and nay-sayers is at USD$200, not some other imaginary price that you've come up with.

Is there any documented proof of this?  I feel that a lot of the negativity about deflation and the "deflationary spiral" refer to the great depression.  The problem in the depression is that they had deflation with debt.  If you have debt and money is deflating, you're screwed, because suddenly that loan that cost 25% of your paycheck to service, now costs 50% of your paycheck.  This *does* impact spending and slow the economy, which does cause a spiral.  BUT - with bitcoin, it is not debt-based, and when prices and wages go down, everyone still has the same discretionary purchasing power but with their savings worth more.  If they want to take advantage of their savings being worth more, then they spend it which increases money flow which pushes prices up, making money cheaper, and a new equilibrium is formed.

It will be important to choose a block size limit that rewards miners enough to fund an appropriate network hashrate, but also big enough to keep transactions affordable.  It shouldn't be too hard to find a sweet spot.
Remember that the bigger bitcoin gets, the more value is being transacted per day.  Like at the moment, maybe theres a few million $ worth transacted per day.  Imagine when there's hundreds of billions being moved around daily (like with forex).. you only need to skim a very small % to be making huge money off of that.

* No detail of which specific stores were purchased from, and what items
* The form is retrospective - the user only finds out once per year, at the end of the reporting period
* User has no control over individual purchasing decisions, whereas the open BTC charity would allow the user to directly fund proposals which involve concrete details on exact purchases and deployment plans
Basically the open charity would be 1000x more transparent than the established charities.

and to receive payment, why would you print out your private key on the back of it and show someone the public side?
I guess we need more info from OP to understand exactly what happened.
Option 1: person paid with a paper wallet (insecure)
Option 2: merchant showed customer the paper wallet so they could QR scan it and pay (insecure since they could have somehow caught a glimpse of the flip side)
Option 3: transaction was done securely and the paper wallet was later printed and famed as a token memento.

For example, PrimeCoin has a whitepaper which extends on bitcoin with its "scientifically useful" proof-of-work method:  and then someone released an optimised miner which does all sorts of interesting optimisations for finding the primes, and a whole lot of interesting discussion has spawned around the possibility of using other scientific applications for proof-of-work.
Proof of stake is another interesting concept because it removes the big energy expenditure associated with bitcoin mining (eg. PPCoin)
There are also many coins which play with the mining incentives.  Bitcoin will rely on fees-only when the block reward dies off, and it's not 100% clear how this will unfold in terms of game theory and economics, so some alternatives have different minting schemes such as being infinite but limited by moore's law (primecoin block reward = 999/(difficulty^2))
freicoin is interesting because of its demurrage system, it tries to encourage spending over hoarding, although the centralised aspect of it is questionable.
there are all sorts of variations of block frequency, which is great information to have for finding the sweet spot.  Satoshi picked 10 minutes seemingly based on gut feeling, and now others are experimenting with faster confirmation times at the expense of increased orphan blocks and decreased difficulty.  some coins take it way too far and go for a 30 second block time.
It is also fascinating to see some of the bitcoin doomsday scenarios actually play out in the real world - alt coins regularly experience things like 51% attacks, hard forks gone wrong, developers disappearing, stupid bugs ruining coins, exchanges listing and de-listing them, so its kind've like a great testbed for some "what if" scenarios for bitcoin.
I'm also looking forward to seeing zerocoin implemented in an altcoin and seeing how that works out.

Because you get to keep 100% of the gains (new coins) but share the losses with everyone (devaluation of existing coins).  The end result is that you profit if your % of network hashing power is greater than the % of bitcoins in circulation that you own.

It still is extraordinary to lose 10 times in a row.  As has been said in this thread, it's about a 1 in 63 chance.  If he repeated the strategy 63 times though, you would expect it might occur.

Sarcastic?  No I'm being serious.  Most of these wealthy elites that you speak of would have been broke in 2008 if they didn't use their power of the printing press to bail themselves out.  Most of the banks wouldn't be around right now... they speculated and created a bubble, it burst, and they should have gone broke.

Your analysis is correct assuming that transactions always get into the next block.  Unfortunately there seem to be an increasing number of pools making deliberately small blocks.
This chart here shows the average confirmation time is currently around the 10-15mins mark as the guy above said: 
This is because you have to wait for a 'nice' pool to be kind enough to include your transaction.  Unfortunately it doesn't actually make economic sense to include a transaction in a block currently, unless the fee much higher than normal.

That's it.  It's value is based on faith and trust in bitcoin itself (thus "intrinsic").  With dollars, the faith and trust isn't in the actual paper, it's in the US government's ability to make good on their debts and maintain their empire.  A fiat currency is only as good as the government that backs it, and that's where the fragility comes from because governments *never* last forever (every fiat currency in history has gone to 0).  With bitcoin, when satoshi decides to walk away, nothing changes because the we value bitcoin itself rather than placing trust in a group of people.  Bitcoin, through its mathematical definition, is permanent and will be here forever, which gives it much better fundamentals than a fiat currency.

Very cool concept!  Can the private keys be passphrased?  The way if you lose the coin it gives you enough time to move it to a safe address.
I guess it would be good practice to carry several of these on you, with copies of the same keys for redundancy, in case one of them fails.  You wouldn't want to arrive in a new country to find that your life savings had been lost due to a chip failure :)

If the analogies aren't really satisfying your curiosity, you're probably best to actually try to understand what a hash function is.  I'm not sure how much background in computing you have though so it might take some further reading to understand it.
The key points about a cryptographic hash function are:
- Takes an input of arbitrary size (which you could call a number, or a binary string), and produces an output of a fixed size (eg. 256 bits).
- The function will always output the same value for the same input, ie. it is not a random function.
- The outputs of the function should ideally be close to a uniform random distribution over the output space (ie. no bias).
- Given an input/output pair, it should be impossible to find another input which produces the same output (known as a collision).
eg. the SHA-256 output for "hello" is: 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
(the string "hello" is ASCII encoded, with each character representing 8 bits.  and the output is hex-encoding, with each character representing 4 bits).
Given the properties of a cryptographic hash function, if I asked you to find an input that results in a hash beginning with 12345678, this would take you 4 billion attempts on average (2^32) because you are looking for a specific 32 bits, and all you are capable of doing is trying new inputs and getting a pseudo-random 32 bits as output, so your chances of a hash beginning with 12345678 are 1/2^32 = 1 in ~4 billion.  If you were able to show me an input which produces the resulting hash, this forms a "proof of work", because you've proven that you've tried lots of hashes (assuming no weaknesses are found in SHA-256).

It's not about the protocol, it's about the max size block that a node will accept as valid.  Currently the bitcoin reference client is coded to only accept blocks up to 1 MB.  Eventually, they'll have to patch it to increase that.  The point is, no one can mine blocks larger than the limit because they won't propagate.

Yeah, I had that too.  It only happens the first time, if you previously loaded the bitcoin page.

Bitcoins aren't a physical thing, they are information.  You can't have them in your hand.  Sorry.  The closest thing you can do is make some kind of physical object and record a private key on it, and then that object kinda becomes the secure storage of your private key information, but it's still not a physical bitcoin.

and this is why economists are useless
btw no one is earning wages in btc.  in the very few cases where people are, it's converted from a fiat value at time of purchase.  so theres no "wages are downward nominally sticky" problem or whatever your textbook said.

Get educated about laws over there.  They don't "cut your hand off", first they'll want a bribe, and if you can't pay them a LOT of money, you'll probably be thrown in jail for 10 years.  In jail you'll likely start using heroin, sharing needles, and before long you'll be a HIV positive prison junkie.

Yep... agree.. I like what he said, but he was incorrect about the cost to produce gold.  Maybe there are some ultra low cost miners who can extract it for $150/oz, but many miners are struggling to be viable with prices anywhere below $1500/oz.
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:12:07
Yeah but they appear to be placing too much important on the variance.  It matters if you're only going to mine for a few hours, but if you are going to be mining 24/7 for weeks then it makes no difference to join a smaller pool.  Even a pool that's 3% of the network should get ~30 blocks per week.  I wish miners would grow some balls and accept a bit of variance for the sake of decentralising mining power.
