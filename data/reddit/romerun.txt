problem of pool mining again, maybe it makes more sense to switch to POS
@_date: 2016-04-13 17:10:23
heard Kraken is slow and unreliable
@_date: 2016-04-11 18:36:15
Well judging disappointment in OB reddit, looks like OB isn't really ready,  it should remain beta
@_date: 2016-04-05 01:22:29
Then how come btc price doesn't change 
@_date: 2016-04-23 14:52:32
so woke man
@_date: 2016-04-24 09:11:15
didn't read but thinking the same thing, why only 23 votes/3 comments ?
@_date: 2016-04-08 07:40:42
I'm surprised that purse haven't got shutdown by gov. The fact that they are still here has me to think that they might actually work and are the bitcoin killer app. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 11:13:03
Yeah us banking is retarded making localbtc not so reliable

none of them is as good as selling coin thru Circle which gets a better rate than bitstamp, then use capital 1 atm card to withdraw, 0 fee worldwide. Page me again if there's a better route.
@_date: 2016-04-29 13:26:14
OB killer store right here. I approved.
@_date: 2016-04-10 12:08:18
you have tits ?
@_date: 2016-04-26 08:38:39
so pretty much, you want to mine Steam games
@_date: 2016-04-27 00:21:52
so it's about the end of the month. Are we on course for segwit as schedule ?
@_date: 2016-04-30 01:31:30
I guess they are doing dynamic limit. When there's a lot of demand they drops limit of some users to minimize their risk etc.
@_date: 2016-04-27 01:12:22
where ? from  "April 2016*	0.12.x	Segregated witness deployment including block size increase"
@_date: 2016-04-23 14:09:22
so am I woke, someone just bot my last stash of weed that I hodl with Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-04-08 01:17:12
can Brave block ads like facebook suggested post, or reddit sponsored link ?
@_date: 2016-04-28 11:28:36
They can say it's from a bot, but that bot actually run on their behalf on their internal server. Just like the good old times in MtGox.

@_date: 2016-04-25 07:44:01
nothing new really. SOmeday he'll reincarnate and hopefully recall where he put his cold stash then get to spend it by his young body
@_date: 2016-04-28 11:06:41
that is useful, can I use those prepaid giftcards ? Instead of having to spend them on things that I don't need, I rather swap it for coins.

meh, what's new here ? it works as design.
@_date: 2016-04-17 23:34:59
Downloading software makes opportunity for trojan exploit. I'm reluctant to install new apps to my laptop these days unless they come from trusted source on thepiratebay . OB should be JS running in browser

when you transferred the unencrypted wallet to dropbox, if it's not on ssl communication, then it could also be a man in the middle between you and dropbox.
@_date: 2016-04-06 13:23:33
He's right though 
@_date: 2016-04-18 20:42:57
It only means high volatility is due. 
@_date: 2016-04-10 04:54:56
just an excuse for ICO
@_date: 2016-04-08 10:01:59
It could expand to other markets in other countries 
@_date: 2016-04-16 05:11:25
China products would be interesting, like toothbrush heads, batteries priced competitively to ebay. I would definitely order. I don't need hand made soap, or alpaca socks to be shipped to me 20 days later as I could make or buy them from local market. So overpriced handmade stuff won't make a lot of progress to btc market 
@_date: 2016-04-20 23:24:02
holy shit
@_date: 2016-04-28 11:19:43
Geez, sounds like a bot got hammered
@_date: 2016-04-02 10:22:29
yeah and what stop people making proxies to open up their apis for free
@_date: 2016-04-25 13:12:33
yeah I agree bitcoin has a magic ability to filter out technology impaired persons
@_date: 2016-04-25 01:33:17
why bother putting it on when most people don't notice it
@_date: 2016-04-07 08:43:27

@_date: 2016-04-06 14:59:55
pretty sure silkroad localbitcoins and gambling sites are still off limit
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:12:32
pretty sure him has the private key of that paper wallet? If clinton won't claim it in a year, he'll sweep it back
@_date: 2016-04-17 23:29:37
More than that you have to burn precious bitcoin to run a contract instead of using native bitcoin script. In 2019 btc will worth so much that nobody will burn it for fun. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 01:27:57
btc has a magic ability to filter out torrentable media payers, so I doubt if we'll see an adoption here.
@_date: 2016-04-16 05:03:54
No, alts make no sense to waste time on. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 10:35:57
Yeah bazabay et al are just product listing. OB needs a Javascript version running off browser. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 23:57:19
the problem is not just no plan to make profit but nobody is using tipbot these days. There were like only 9 tipping daily lately. So after they got a million from VC, everything went south.
@_date: 2016-04-17 02:16:07
Anything that's worth having in turing model will be cloned back into btc scripting. Network effect trumps everything.
@_date: 2016-04-29 10:27:24
You have been warned

it's cool but not needed
@_date: 2016-04-07 00:07:46
Effective zero even when there are millions of tx per sec. Now companies know bitcoin cannot really handle purchase so nobody really adopting it. That will change when we have LN
@_date: 2016-04-07 12:25:06
My last trade was completely in..  err it never completed
@_date: 2016-04-24 01:59:18

so it only works for crypto to crypto ? does fait &lt;=&gt; coin work ?
@_date: 2016-04-30 12:23:40

Process. Both parties have to chitchating for payment info, then there's the hurdle of bank hours, different timezone etc. If both do not online at the same time, the deal is hardly done. Bitquick on the other hand, have some sort of orderbook, nobody has to talk with nobody, no need to check for seller reputation. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 12:34:18
even people stop tipping on Reddit, see how many tx changetip has a day
@_date: 2016-04-12 05:02:19
Best suggestion so far. So instead of showing btc accept s here,  show checkout http:xxx for 15% discount. There you'll have all btc info. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 08:32:32
there's not many alternatives left after bitquick was out

Say Walmart start taking bitcoin, you could say the same like now I can use btc to pay for veggies which I used to take for free from my garden... Point is nobody should pay for nothing as everything a man can make, others should be able to make as well, so nothing should be charged for. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 14:52:20
I rather keep coins in btc-e then on the blockshit.info

waiting for the day I don't need to install the app just to do online OB shopping. Maybe making a javascript version running on browser. Imagine ebay users having to install Ebay app on their pc to buy stuff. Although for smart phone app it could make sense.

how about paper backed by btc ? An organization bot 1 dollar bills ranging from I to J, put some watermark on it and saying it's worth $1+100bits. Then people can use that as everyday cash. Anyone attempting to counterfeit is a felony of counterfeiting USD, free police.

@_date: 2015-12-28 21:31:19

@_date: 2015-06-02 18:46:18

Point is cash is already easy, even easier than cc, paypal. It works offline, it needs no confirmation, no authorization from no gateways.

@_date: 2015-12-04 20:29:43

Discount is meh. If purchasing by btc gets free 2 days shipping like amazon prime, it could be a killer app. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 05:32:14
wait, will there be high risk flag ?
@_date: 2015-06-15 06:20:44
how hard would it be to modify bitcoin so that we can run partial node ? for example, the whole blockchain is 30G, I have 3G free and some bandwidth to contribute to the network. I guess although not many are willing to run the full full node, there should be many don't mind running partial.
@_date: 2015-12-01 02:12:14

Gavin will lose credibility if he does that. Then it will be good for bitcoin because one centralization point is erased, just like when gox busted, other exchanges competed to share the market share, just like when satoshi retired, development became more decentralize.

No. Only delusional redditcoiners might have said that. The reason we shouldn't worry is smart people will engineer a better solution to handle shit-ton of transactions before going mainstream.
Precious space on the blockchain has never meant for cupcake tx, but bank-to-bank transfer. High fee is unavoidable to compensate for block reward reduction, or are you okay with bitcoin to switch to prove of stake once it's unprofitable to mine ?

Because CC is probably not the right way to go. Admit it. It took years for CC to be ready. It probably takes a lot of time to add new things to it. By introducing meta token, it's a simpler route.

I'm not the best person to answer this. From what I read others say -
1. It has to scan the block scan since the beginning of counterparty protocol to verify transaction where colorcoin can do it with less effort.Although this comes with a trade of where protocols like counterparty can do more interesting things.
2. It has to involve introducing a new coin named "xcp" in order for the protocol to work, because Bitcoin coin itself cannot [easily] be escrowed (may have to involve complicate multisig to do no trivial things ?). This makes some people who believe any altcoins is scam coin, dislike it. However, my take is, we build bitcoin to remove fiat friction right, but there still are things not easy to do with bitcoin. And that's where counterparty comes in, to remove the frictions from bitcoin while still maintain relations with bitcoin (to get the benefit of strong bitcoin chain network), not ditching bitcoin entirely and make another feature-riched coin on another weak chain.

problem is merchants are still doing it wrong. Most just put up bitcoin as another payment option along side of theexisting methods. It cannot show bitcoin benefit. Customers will say, oh, paying with mastercard, I get 1% cashback why bitcoin hassle.
Receiving bitcoin does not need customer name, home address, zipcode, physical card swipe, or entering any account numbers. All they need to do is to generate qr codes/deposit addresses associating with user accounts, and hand them to customers.
I rather send btc to pay for the bill than hauling on a bus for 2 hours and pay with Visa just to get that 1% (-bus fare).

openbazaar can def harm amazon with passthru. Instead of shipped by amazon, it would be shipped by Vers, or Kapeles.
If there are more variety of products in openbazaar than amazon / alibaba, customer will find a way to use openbazaar, either directly or passthru

yes, but thing is, eventually btc either goes to million or to zero, nothing in between. It does not matter if one gets in at $100 or $1200. If you believe the technology is worth it, get on facebook, twitter, instragram, or whatever, and get some.

when it matures, I mean 50% of money supply is used to secure the network, so that equals to POW coin, does't it ? Plus peercoin is hybrid model, even the total coin at stake is less than 50%, POW blocks can interrupt double spending attempt. Another plus, coins at exchange are likely to be temporary and have small coin age.

Keep weak hodlers bleeding until the day they have enough, then expose btc to wallst.

@_date: 2014-05-31 14:24:27
well, true or false, depending on much peercoin is worth. If it's worth a lot, a fraction of total money supply is enough for ppl to do stuff. Bitcoin only has a small % in circulation and it sure gets smaller if price continues to grow. In the long long future, if peercoin somehow survives till that day 50+% at stake is totally possible. As now, I guess the major reason is the cold lock minting work is in progress.

well if we buy many vps nodes on the same location with the same provider, they might be as good as one node connectivity- / bandwidth-wised.
so buying from DO alone is way too centralized. nodes should spread across the globe. We should pull out the map of nodes, and see which areas lack and make bounties to fire up a few there.
vps cost is not so important, we are the new elite wealth, remember.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:55:24
True that it's not in the direct interest of miners and full nodes for these 2.0 protocols to live on bitcoin chain, but ether,nxt crap,skycoin,pts,emunie,ripple and what not are trying to do what bitcoin cannot, only god knows whether or not they are needed.
Bitcoin holders should be supportive for these add-on protocols to keep bitcoin stay way way way clear on top of competitors. Do those minuscule 40-80 bytes outweigh this benefit ?

Ignore other variables, one fact still remains true since 2010 is there are new project / service announcements in every single day with an increasing rate. Even the days after the 2011 crash. Btc is still growing exponentially, we just are in the correction phrase which is good, we need a solid price support or we would stumble too hard to recover.
@_date: 2014-09-13 07:20:37
well, at the beginning of this year ppl predicted 10k by the end of year. Then price slid, target was adjusted to 5k. Then price slid more, some big names (2nd market?) predicted 2k. Price staying sideway for months, now he comes up with $10k in 3 years.
In short, price target consensus getiing lower and lower, are we in bear market ?

@_date: 2014-09-05 20:08:03
So far, the clear use cases of cyptomoney are store of value and payment. It's still unclear of what are other killer features. Say people really like distributed exchange (it has yet proven to be more favorable than centralized ones),  then this can be implemented with Multisig along with some magics/tricks, actually we have one implementation in Colorcoin.
Kickstart could be done easily with Meta Coins and yes LightHouse can do it in Bitcoin Protocol.
Online shopping, we have it done in Open Bazaar / Dark Market.
What are things worth for general public that cannot be done in Bitcoin, and requires those 2.0 ?
Single Monetary system is sufficient.

@_date: 2014-02-12 14:22:45
solution is simple, increase blocksize, but we should increase it when it's needed as it would discourage more ppl from running fullnode. I keep 14Gish of blockchain in usb external drive and it's tolerably slow. If blocksize is to increase next year in conjunction with 500G+ SSD is more affordable, I would be ok for the increase blocksize.
@_date: 2014-10-07 05:18:33
It's the motivation to kickstart a project.
Compare to Mastercoin, the funding model was to send in, and look how lazy their devs are. When you destroy it, there's no going back, and everyone burning the stake should participate.
It's like bitcoin, when we cash in fiat, it's our best interest to make it reality.
So mastercoin could be lazy because if it does not work, they can send btc backs to holders.
But the "purchase" model, like ethereum, or other scam coins is even worse. There is nothing saying the organizations will return back precious btc, if it fails.

No,  should definitely not compare to silver or fiat,  they are dumb. Btc is not only useful just for currency or store of value.

Things are moving off chain. Even alt services are considered off chain btc services ( doge tipping for example will eventually be converted to btc) . Alts are just free bitcoin advertisements.

All this without third-party risk. For example, if I make a bet, I don't send money to anybody. I only tell the protocol, and it will escrow my money. Trust is removed from a centralized entity to the protocol.
Anyone cares Bitcoin should hope for Counterparty success. Without innovative protocols like this, we would be overshadowed (feature-wised) by those scam coins calling themselves Bitcoin 2.0 living on obscure chains (such as Next ?).

From what I understand, server doesn't store user private keys, just like blockchain.info. The wallet is also deterministic using 12 words to seed similar to electrum. Risk is probably the same issue as how do you know the server does not alter html/javascript on the browser once in a while, although in this case counterwallet comes from the core developers of counterparty team.

blocksize lim has to be lifted at some points no doubt. I only guess that it won't really affect the increase of bitcoin usage, adoption, and price.

no. I "might" pay because I want to reward good work not because of fine. Most people who are torrenting anti the idea of intellectual property / patent etc and believe software/movie/music should be free and only pay in case of donation. Music has been shifting to itune from record company to reward the real performer. I want to see hollywood movie actors/actresses/producer are paid by decentralized donation as well. It could happen if the majority of people stop going to theaters, stop paying for netflix, and get everything free from torrent or other kinds, then hollywood will face the situation as music industry having to shift toward something like itune store where people pay for individuals instead of movie (ie instead of buying wolf of wall street, we buy dicaprio, mcconaughey, the producers, and some actors we like). Pornstar are artists so they should be rewarded the same way in the end. Sounds extreme, but interesting right ?

True that many things can be done with multisig, but having meta coin make it easier or possible for non trivial things. For example Betting of counterparty, the mediator (feed broacaster) can gain some incentive of X% from the task. Wager and counterwager have different odds. In counterparty protocol, it's just doing accounting. Imagine doing this with multisig. Then there's an issue of hosting all the bet offers on a distributed platform. Counterparty works as it utilizes bitcoin distributed network to host these information.

well, I was hoping it be more mainstream ready that it was for a beta. Not sure if things have changed, last time tried, it required port forwarding so I can't run on my laptop but had to put it on a vps. Without a proper portforwarding, non-seller can't browse items on other nodes. It does not make sense.
 Not to mention that it's was quite buggy. The instance I ran on the vps crashed within 24 hours. I kept restarting it for a week before shutting it down.
But the biggest issue I have with OB is, it does not seem to do search really well. I tried simple keyword like "phone", nothing showed up, so I guess it must not work. Again not sure if things have changed, but I was hoping that it should be able to do decentralized searching, even on nodes that are offline. There should be some kinds of mechanism to cache the index of items on every shops to online nodes... Looking at the history, napster worked great, then we have gnutella trying to do decentralize of it, but it did not do search as good as the centralized solution. Bittorrent became popular because centralized browsing/searching works.. I'm afraid that OB could be another gnutella if it can't fix this problem.

well, POS has some sense of centralization too. Because the unit is minted from the inside hodlers. I don't really like pure POS because of that. We have blackcoin, finished POW mining in a week, boom, those early miners became Fed. We have Nxt selling ICO for 21/71 persons or so, boom, they are in charge.
If Satoshi did ICO or went pure POS within a year or two, bitcoin would never take off, as it sounds much rigged.
Although I'm all for bitcoin transforms to POS or POW POS hybrid after 10-20 years, and/or become mainstream. There's no point to waste more energy.

I got almost instant on my last two txs. Last year on some bad days I had to wait for a hour. It's the way the thing was designed. For example, if your tx has too many inputs, even paying enough fee, some miners might decide to skip it for the greater good.. Blocksize/Segwit is not your ultimate savior, but Lightning is, as it makes 0-conf tx trustworthy. Thing is, if Classic fork happens, it will derail the community, devs, and price so bad that those clever technologies, lightning/sidechain will be significantly delayed by distraction it creates.

a bit unrelated to this but I found it more interesting to give rating by  coins. So say I have $20 again as a year budget, for movies I like I send a lot, for movies I hate I send 5 satoshis each or so depending on how lame. Then I have a personal movie rating on global blockchain. (a short review can also be attached on OP_RETURN).. For those who have similar taste shall dig into my list. Also the producers get the money they deserve. It can also be applied to porn, but the money should go straight to actresses.

It's no brainer. If big pools and centralized wallets jump gun to classic, no more core dev, no segwit, no lightning, no sidechain, no shit gets done, bitcoin will never catch on mainstream. Or we can wait til April for segwit, and we get to keep everything... It's not like blocks are so congested that we have to switch right away to the community shatter fork...
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:00:03
He didn't know what he's saying. How could sidechain be more important than LN? Sidechain is for experiment. It can wait.  I hear There's also some  retard technical issues like having to wait for 1-3 days when converting from chain to chain. Not only does LN enable bitcoin to scale to infinity, a thing that cant be achieved with sidechain, it also makes unconfirmed tx safe enabling bitcoin be the real money for mainstream..

all this will change when we have LN. unconfirmed will be trustable, micro transactions will make sense, bitcoin will be able to handle limitless number of tx, then companies real people will start consider accepting it, building technology around it.

"should". I don't know about you but it's not often I run into that situation when paying enough fee. On average I think it's working as advertised. The only difference now and the past is when paying 0 fee, it used to confirm within 3 blocks, now 3 hours, in the future could be 3 days. That's fine. Even CC intro 0-APR only lasts a year or two.

let's say, it is to build on peercoin as the chain is small, more suitable as settlement layer etc. Once it's launched, it will be forked to Bitcoin right away, because that's where the network effect is. LN also needs hub operators. Big hub requires big capital for settlement on both ends. In bitcoinland we have, Draper / Bitpay etc who want to run major hubs.

size of the block has little to do on bitcoin scaling because N is still N. Putting entire N into the decentralized database won't scale. Core devs know that. Any programmers know that. In order to scale properly, only a small portion of N will be allowed to sit on the db, the rest won't. That's where the LN comes in.

I guess they will likely make minimum changes like changing number from 1M to 2. So that its easy to diff. Unlike BitcoinXT, where its not easy to know what were changed. Garvin shouldn't have endorsed XT in the first place, he backed out and formed the classic upsetting Mike. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:24:51
how soon can segwit soft fork be deployed ? If it happens before classic, will these classic miners reconsider their positions ?
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:57:20
Maybe there are more miners supporting Core than Classic. When Bitfury, KNC, Ants run Classic, pool members who disagree will leave for Eligius or bigger pools supporting Core. I don't think Classic can get to 75% that easy. Theymos would put a sticky thread persuading miners to Core. Blockstream / 21 Inc. would raise another 21M acquiring as much asic as possible to kill Classic. Will sea.

just sent from electrum few days ago with default fee. It took 3 hours. The fee was 20 satoshi per byte which took between 3-21 blocks or so to confirm according to cointape at that moment. So I guess wallets will have switch to dynamic fee. And after all wallets have switched, we will be in the same situation or worse if the throughput of network still the same

@_date: 2016-02-23 02:40:24
As a typical btc redditor who doesn't give a f, increasing blocksize is meh, nothing exciting happening, n tx is still n tx, bitcoin never go mainstream, no moon. With LN, besides unlimited tx, we get instant payment thru safe unconfirmed, increase annonimity and whatnot, then there's a point for the mass to use. It also enables future technologies like IOT. I see this as the real moon sign. You want the price to go back up above thousand right? Blocksize won't take you there, neither will halving, but LN and other innovative stuffs not just changing a constant number can.

Back in the days, some pools decided not to include satoshidice txs. Its not really effective as the majority believed they're still financial txs, but in this case spam is spam, we might be able to agree to exclude some tx pattern and keep fee and blocksize low for a little while

2.5.1 , dynamic fee is on. I guess it must be shitty algo then. Ideally they should pull up data from cointape, and display that to user to decide how much fee vs how many blocks to confirm, before sending, so user can know what to expect

this is why Btc price is going nowhere. Big players, instead of buying bitcoin and hold it strong, try to overcomplicate it.

same true with all crypto assets. When there's no regulations, it's too convenient to pull exit scam, shameless pump/dump/inside trading, neobee, asicminer, etc. Although if we add mediators to a crowdfund project, it may protect consumer to some level. For example, such project can only access partials of  crowdfunded money in stages of product delivery. The mediators will need to sign if the crowdfunder has completed such tasks before getting a partial fund.

Blockchain can handle lots of transactions "within reason". Not many agree to see 1TB+ blockchain size increases daily. Micropayment channel solution is a hybrid of decentralized and centralized, users temporarily trust middlemen entities, util their tx get merged on to the blockchain. I hear at least a guy is working on it, and bitpay want to be one of the middlemen. Btw, when the tx fee floats, sending dust without fee will never get included.

1. Have you ever heard about us?
- yes
2. What do you like about BitQuick?
- I was hoping I could buy/sell quicker than localb
3. What do you dislike about BitQuick?
- Nope, there's no liquidity. Another thing I really don't like is, seller does not feel having control over the deposited BTC in that, in order to cancel the escrow, seller has to email bitquick ??
The authentication requires a secret password generated upon creating order. What if user forgets it, then he has to email bitquick again ? why not offer signature verification of one of the inputs etc.
IMO, nobody wants to email nobody for actions on the web.

bitcoin needs to fly under the radar until it's really ready for the majority of the world, or it will crash real hard from not meeting the crowd expectation or killed by some powerful organizations. We know that this kind of mechanism controlling wealth without central authority has to happen somedays, and bitcoin has a good damn chance to be the first and most important one. I saw it written somewhere as "don't invest in btc more then you effort to lose". I see it as an agenda not to make the crowd too excited and jump on a thing that's still beta and crash it, but rather let it grows into the world bit by bit. In some sense, btc is religion.

bitcoin looks too expensive to buy, the exchanges should show price in satoshi unit, or they should introduce leverage and margin in popular exchanges.

I'm wondering if the fix had been deployed during the chaos to save the day (apparently, it's still lagging on high volume), or it's still in the schedule and we can expect to see blazing fast gox for the first time ? And how does the f*k up in the past two days affect the plan to support Alt-coins ?

if you use a rogue client sending big transaction to s.dice with no fee they  wait for 1 confirm (from what I heard), because it looks like a spam or an attempt to do double spending. When appropriate fee is paid, double spending is harder, so they can allow 0 confirm.
Not on top of my head.

diff too high, price drop, not worth electric, that's why even big players stop, and by that time small players won't make any diff, until the price is back up or more efficient asic.

I was looking into gyft thing for gas another day ago, I asked myself, isn't it better to use credit card and get 5% cashback, then sell coin over campbx or coinbase, use that to pay for cc bill. Not only you I can get the huge 5% back, I also get to sell my coin later which is likely to have more value on price rally, and lastly it's like 10 times less hassle to get gas with cc.

That's what in my mind. Bitcoin is supposed to eliminate middleman, promotes fair trading, big players should not have edge against small players only because they are in the first tier of exchange, price-wised, volume-wised, not to mention the security risk of pass throughs.
@_date: 2013-07-03 04:45:51
bitcoin needs to test 50 or 30 before shooting to 1000, that's why. More reason is at 100, people see it as "maybe" overvalue, but when it touches 50, they will think, oh shitttt it must be the bottom, coincidently with some big announcement, it could rally to 1000.

email spamming prevention, sender has to send coin along with email, inorder for receiver to read, if receiver reads it and it's not spam, he sends the coin back, spammer has to pay the advertisement price. 1H37ToysLXLeKtHrzSC6VZ4HJssFgWENqz

bitcoin-qt is like one of those softwares running in bank datacenter. Not only does it require like 20G of space to keep blockchain, but you also have to be careful, like never send coin while it's syncing, coz there's a lot of chance to corrupt db, never shutdown before closing it etc.

what you say is right, yet it's still growing healthier than other alt-coins. There are several benefits that did not come with the design, but discovered along the journey, such as BTC business can just starts accepting LTC with minimum effort, converting back and forth between crypto currencies are easy, BTC is too expensive for many among us as of now, stashing tons of LTC is like winning a lottery ticket if it ever takes off, or BTC is LTC's beta as some claim, or BTC is worth too much to spend, etc...

create at least 5 backups, send one to your mom, bury one under the tree, and keep backing up at least every year coz bit can rot, your wallet uses up all gen addresses, etc, back it up online too with multiple encryptions
