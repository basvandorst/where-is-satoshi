There is a Japanese Kanji for 10,000, which is 万. And Japanese think bigger numbers in units of 100,000,000, written as 億, which is 10,000 by 10,000.

Actually onchainfx answered this question on Twitter. Turns out the difference is explained by blockchain assuming more of the transactions are change (going back to the person paying) than onchainfx.
These assumptions are called the "NVT" metric, which spells out to "network value to transaction ratio". More detail is available [here](

Roughly, by 2100 all 21 million bitcoins will be mined.
If you write that in the Japanese way as 2100 multiplied by 10,000 (as opposed to thinking 21 multiplied by 1,000,000) you find a reason why there are 21 million bitcoins in the protocol.
That in turn hints that whoever is Satoshi Nakamoto, that person was used to thinking in units of 10,000 as a Japanese person would be.

I have written a book last year about [Japanese Bitcoin law]( where I argue that existing banking law required MtGox to get a banking license, since they were taking deposits.
I think having the FATF support this position is a step in the right direction. The alternative of giving anyone the right to accept hundreds of millions of dollars in deposits without any oversight whatsoever had some unfortunate results.

Right now any lawsuit where it matters (in Japan) can't go forward anyway. Civil rehabilitation blocks individual lawsuits. Once that is finished because it is hopeless to get any creditor majorities, a real bankruptcy proceeding will follow. Individual lawsuits are blocked by that as well.
If you want to pay a lawyer and see some results for your money, I would look for someone who knows something about Japanese bankruptcy law and is able to intervene right here in Tokyo in the civil rehabilitation and bankruptcy procedures.
Under civil rehabilitation and bankruptcy laws, MtGox is not allowed to discriminate between creditors. You won't get less of a payout because you have a lawyer.
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:30:46
As far as MtGox is concerned, Japanese law would be applied.
But I am talking about a general principle. Only real people can know something, so to have a company own bitcoins, we need rules on how real people related to some company knowing a private key means that the company owns it, and not the real person in question.
 
One easy rule would be to identify a Bitcoin address as belonging to some company or other, possibly including the name of the company in a vanity address. Then publish that in the same way as digital signiture certificates are published. That would be the equivalent of having the company name in a ledger showing ownership of real estate.
Other rules are possible, and will be developed eventually. I am quite confident that there are no such rules in present Japanese law. The Bitcoin network is too new for that.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:52:08
Thanks. Actually that was one of my motivations for looking at these regulations.
Actually it would also be interesting to look at escrow models that remove the need for bitcoin deposits as well. Or maybe some kind of guarantee model: User A posts security one way or other, and is allowed to trade bitcoins on the exchange up to the amount of said security without depositing them.

For the actual money part, the way you described for stock brokers is the business model of bitcoin.de (a German exchange) and the new SecondMarket exchange. The money never touches the exchange, which avoids a lot of headaches on both sides.
For bitcoins, one could just do multi-signature escrow instead of sending them to the exchange.

Yes. MtGox is the debtor, and if Mark Karpeles is trying to conceal their assets he is liable under Article 255.
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:37:14
One of the orders of the Court was for the debtor to provide monthly updates about the situation to the Court and the Supervisor, at the latest at the 10th of each month.
10th of March was three days ago. So has there any report been filed? If so, why is it not published on the MtGox homepage?
It's also quite interesting to read the Japanese only part, the petition to open the civil rehabilitation procedure. For example:
* The debtor (MtGox/Karpeles) thinks it will be possible to receive support for a rehabilitation plan from creditors if there is a "thorough investigation".
* The debtor thinks that many existing and new customers will use the MtGox exchange once it opens under new leadership, even if it is impossible to pay back deposits of bitcoins and traditional currency.
* The debtor thinks that it will be possible to find investors once the exchange is running again.
I disagree with these sentiments. No customers will stay after this mess. No one will invest there. This rehabilitation procedure should not be opened in the first place. If it is opened, it should be closed as hopeless under Article 191 of the Japanese Civil Rehabilitation Act as soon as possible.
@_date: 2014-05-18 13:10:10
There are plenty of regulations specific to traditional currencies. Let's try and make a very incomplete list:
* Prohibition of forgery
* Legal tender (everybody needs to accept them in the country of the currency)
* All banking regulations that require licenses for taking deposits in traditional currencies
* All civil procedure and bankruptcy regulation concerning enforcing money claims by seizing the debtor's property and converting it to cash
* All civil law regulations dealing with payment
That list could go on. Money is important in law.

Very rare to get any information out of MtGox lately, so this is most welcome.

It's an interesting question what happens with bitcoins in a possible MtGox bankruptcy.
For one, MtGox KK (the company) doesn't own any bitcoins. All private keys are controlled by the owner, who is not a party to any contracts customers have with MtGox KK.
Possibly, people affected could get only money paid out that is in company bank accounts. No one outside knows the amount available there.
If customers get a verdict against the owner, there remains the tricky question of how exactly one is to execute into bitcoins as an asset class. Obviously existing Japanese law says nothing about that issue. I think it is an interesting question. If there is no good answer, a lot of things are about to change in bankruptcy law, divorce law, and just any other situation where people may be inclined to hide some assets.

There is an application for an EU "Bitcoin" trademark being examined right now:
The filing company wants trademark protection for the areas of jewelry, handbags, and apparel.
The EU trademark for "bitcoin" originally filed by MtGox and now owned by Japanese exchange "Bitflyer" is here:
One objection to these trademarks would be that they are "generic terms" lacking distinctiveness.
Another would be that "Bitcoin" has acquired massive good will in its ten year history growing to a $125 billion marketcap. None of that growth is due to efforts of this particular trademark holder, so they don't deserve any special protection.

I have read his book "Tapdancing to Work", and some of the general rules on investing he states there actually make the case for investing in bitcoins.
One of them is: "Don't invest in something you don't understand." Since Buffett doesn't understand bitcoins or the Bitcoin network, or the difference between these two, it makes perfectly sense for him to invest elsewhere.
Another of them is to look ahead ten years, and ask if the investment makes sense in the long term. Don't worry or even care about short term fluctuations. If you invest in bitcoins, that strategy means buy some and then don't touch them for at least a couple of years. Anyone who has followed this advice has done well, if they bought at least six months ago.
And it is somewhat of an irony that one of Buffett's early successes was to bet on credit cards not failing in the market just because the technology had a couple of growing pains at the time.

The United States government would probably have to wait for substantially less time than other users to actually get their money.

For example, some country could make it a criminal offense to take bitcoins as a payment, to hold them, and to sell them.

The most urgent thing to do: Make sure that the MtGox database is not deleted (would be a crime under Article 259 of the Civil Rehabilitation Act) and open the website for customer login so that everyone has access to their transaction history.

Nothing in the wording of Article 3 implies an interest. The Japanese Supreme Court decided on July 26, 1960, that there is no need for a profit motive when taking deposits. The reason was: The profit motive does not matter for the need to make sure deposits are safe against incompetence and fraud, which is why there is a Banking Act in the first place. The same reasoning holds for the question if there is an interest or not.
  
Also, if you let the fact that the customer doesn't even get interest mean that he doesn't get the protection of the Banking Act either, that's rather lacking in consideration for consumer protection. If anything, having for example a very high interest paid may compensate for a lack of regulatory protection. But having zero interest should mean, all things equal, that the need for protection becomes all the stronger.
German law is spelling this out clearly, but it is clear from the wording of Article 3 and the objective of the Banking Act that this is true for Japanese law as well.
It is another interesting question (which I have yet to study in detail) if MtGox needs a license under the law you mentioned as well.

About that "lack of regulation" part: Just because there is no Bitcoin specific regulation yet in Japan, that doesn't mean that existing rules don't apply.

A couple of comments (mostly questions).
* I do not yet understand how exactly this is supposed to relate to the ongoing civil rehabilitation (not bankruptcy) procedure. Are creditors expected to exchange their claims to remaining assets for equity in a newly formed company?
* Just for discussions sake, since there are some new assets (200K bitcoins) in play, let's assume that with a simple distribution of assets everybody would get 25%. Take creditor X with 100 bitcoins stuck in MtGox: He would get 25 bitcoins back under simple distribution. If your plan goes through, would that mean he would get nothing, but had a chance to sell his shares later?
* What happens with the MtGox stock company under the plan? Will it be dissolved? Are there no plans to use the options in Article 154 Paragraph 3 and 4 of the Civil Rehabilitation Act?
* If the answer to the previous question is "dissolve MtGox", would that mean that you are opposed to civil rehabilitation and want to transfer to bankruptcy procedure as fast as possible?
* Have you discussed this plan with the Civil Rehabilitation supervisor (Attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi), or with counsel for MtGox? If not, are there any plans to do so?
* Do you plan to submit this as a civil rehabilitation plan under Article 163 Paragraph 2?

If you understand the term "Bitcoin regulation" in this narrow way, that is your personal view that no one I know of shares. And ironically, even if you restrict your view in this way, there is plenty of regulation involved. The Bitcoin core software is released under something called a "MIT license", which like all open source software works on top of copyright.
I am interested in the question since I am writing a book about Bitcoin regulation in Japan. Questions I address are taxation (capital gains, consumption tax), market regulation (insider trading and market manipulation), licensing for exchanges, application of theft statutes to stealing bitcoins, money laundering, and several others. If I am not supposed to call these questions "Bitcoin regulation", what would be the term left?
And while it is true that there has not been much Bitcoin specific regulation until now, using Bitcoin is not a trump card that allows anyone to ignore existing regulation. As you say, any company needs to refrain from violating the fraud statute. That means Bitcoin companies are regulated, just like everybody else.

The good news is that now the address in their [terms of use]( (English version) is nearly correct. Still spelled wrong there, though.
They had used that address previously, [before moving to the building next to the one]( they were until now, and then moving again to much extended office space in the building where a "Bitcoin Cafe" is scheduled to open next month, last year in October.

With some substantial media attention to this story, the days where the Japanese Financial Services Authority could just ignore the problems with MtGox are probably over.
In my view, there are at least two Japanese laws that require a license for running an operation like the MtGox exchange. It will be interesting to find out if the Financial Services Authority agrees, once it actually looks at the situation and the damage it caused to depositors all over the World. And if it does not agree, what exactly the reason for that might be.

The first thing he needs to learn is how to spell. It is "Bitcoin" with a capital B when you are talking about the network, and "bitcoin" with a small b when talking about units. Probably he doesn't even understand the difference between these two concepts. That explains that he fails to see the intrinsic value of the Internet finally getting a network neutral payment functionality.
He manages to get one point right, though. Digital currencies are potentially open to pump and dump market manipulation (bitcoin less than altcoins). And this might very well be illegal, just like market manipulation in other markets. See for example the definition in Article 1 of the EU market abuse directive:

In a recent [interview with Masayoshi Son]( he explained that he was the richest person in the World for exactly three days.
Then, before he had a chance to tell anyone, the dotcom bubble crashed and he lost 99% of his stock valuation, was stuck with only a couple of hundred million dollars worth left.
But, as he observed already at the time, the Internet was still growing every day. The fundamental bet on the future of the Internet was still correct.
 
The same is true here. Prices for bitcoins (the currency unit) have gone down somewhat (still not 99%, though). But Bitcoin (the network) is still growing exponentially every day. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:34:37
Actually, I have also a small amount of bitcoins at MtGox (like you).
The reason is that even if you can't process everything, you still should process as much as you can do manually.
And your (and my) smaller amount would also be worth a lot more if we didn't need to worry if MtGox lacks the bitcoins or just the technical means to do payments.
@_date: 2014-02-01 10:47:02
I agree completely.
However, I think the correct way to spell is "Bitcoin" (capital B) when talking about the network, and "bitcoin" (small b) when talking about the units of value allowed there.

Headline at Coindesk is misleading. This is not a proposal to introduce something new. It is the answer of the Ministry of Finance how they understand the existing law.
As such, that opinion is not completely without merit. However, there is no reason to discriminate against bitcoins in this way, making the present law unconstitutional. You need a good reason to discriminate.
As long as such a new law is not in place, the way to solve this problem is to use an analogy to Article 4 Number 8 b) of the Value Added Tax Act.
Obviously it makes no sense to treat a sales contract where someone pays with bitcoin as a barter agreement. The fact that there is no legal obligation to take bitcoins as payment is certainly not sufficient to treat this completely different from what the parties want, and what this is in the economic reality.

Prices lower at MtGox means that the market pays a premium for the insecurity of getting bitcoins out of MtGox. That will persist as long as MtGox doesn't resume bitcoin withdrawals. Anyone betting on MtGox being solvent and eventually enabling withdrawals can make a lot of money by arbitrage. But with that comes a high risk, just as it was profitable but risky to do arbitrage when MtGox prices were higher.
All this proves nothing about MtGox solvency. They need to publish financial statements of Tibanne, and bring in an auditing firm. As long as that doesn't happen, there is just no way to tell for people on the outside.

This kind of situation is usually resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding. Link to English translation of the [Japanese Bankruptcy Law here](
Most relevant in this early stage are probably Article 266, which makes it a crime to give any specific creditor preferential treatment, Article 270, which makes it a crime to delete the MtGox database or try in any other way to delete records, and Article 275, which makes it a crime to "forcibly demand a meeting with the debtor".

You are right on the first point. I checked the [list of 35 banks that have a license]( issued by the Japanese FSA, and they are not on it. They would need to have the word "Ginko" (bank) in their trade name if they had such a license.

You are too late. In 2011, Roger Ver would have bet you that bitcoins valuations outperform your stock over two years by a factor of 100 (he lost, it took bitcoins 2 years and 2 months to outperform everything else by over 100 times).
But just for fun, let's check how Roger would have done against Berkshire. It was $106,750 on August 4, 2011 (the date of his bet) and $176,500 on August 2, 2013, for a gain of 65 percent in 2 years. Meanwhile bitcoins went from $10.58 on August 4, 2011 to $104.86 on August 4, 2013, for a gain of 908%.
That would have been substantially more than the 65% of Berkshire, but not one hundred times more, so you would have won that bet.

The point of having a "rehabilitation" instead of a "bankruptcy" procedure is to try reorganizing. However, any plan would need a majority vote from creditors.

It is open to debate if some country or other adapting bitcoins as a second currency changes anything.
The Japanese government just announced they think bitcoins are not currency, since they have no force as legal tender and no central bank is backing them.
But the Mongolian Tögrög has no legal force either in Japan. And the blockchain mining infrastructure may be already more worth as a backing institution than the Mongolian Central Bank.
And while it is true that foreign currencies have no legal force as a default, the principle of freedom of contract allows people to enter into contracts that create obligations with legal force to pay in dollars, tögrögs, bitcoins, or whatever else the parties to that contract want to use as currency.

The obvious two alternatives are that States will outlaw the Bitcoin network as an evil money laundering tool, or that they will leave it at the present fortunate state of affairs (no such laws).
The third alternative is that they will outlaw black bitcoins and leave white bitcoins alone.
It is a different question if any of these alternatives is desirable. But I agree with the poster above that it very well may play out like that.
I am not sure about the idea of black bitcoins having more value. They can't be used in the large majority of cases where you have no desire to break the law. That should make them less valuable than white bitcoins.

Thank you for your input. That makes sense to me (I mentioned it as one possibility above).
Stocks used to be held in paper certificates. In that case, obviously, you would have the location of the paper.
Now they are database entries. That still leaves you with the location of whatever entity runs the database (bank, stock broker etc).
The main point of the Bitcoin network (as described in the abstract of the original paper by Nakamoto) is that it does not need intermediaries. That would be one difference to stocks or bonds.
But while you don't need them, you can still have them. People can leave some bitcoins at MtGox (not a good idea right now), and those would be located in Japan, since MtGox is in Japan.

For the very least, if there is only one protester at the site, like with the first guy that flew in from Australia, that can't possibly be called an assembly any more.

I have some trouble with Kraken right now.
I signed up, verified at tier 2, and then messed up by depositing over the limit.
The way to rectify that situation was to just get verified as tier 3. And that happened very fast, less than a day after uploading my files. Exceeded my expectations there.
But the weird thing is that they still haven't lifted their "hold" on my last deposit, even after increasing the limit. And support is slow to react (I am already waiting three days).
So, if you use Kraken at tier 2, be careful with these deposit limits.
And if someone from Kraken actually reads this, I would like to suggest a different way to deal with deposits "on hold". Don't just let them sit there in your bank account, without reflecting them in the customer's balance at Kraken. That means I can't get those funds out of your exchange, even if only temporarily. You don't want to have that to happen under any circumstances. It gives a bad feeling to your customers.
Instead, just return any such deposit to the bank account it came from in the first place, or at least allow the customer to request getting that done, just like a normal Euro withdrawal.

Let's see now. If I want to do arbitrage with lower prices at MtGox, I would need to put some cash into the MtGox market, buy cheap bitcoins there, and then sell them on some other exchange for a higher price, going back to cash.
If your theory has any merit, it would seem to prove that MtGox lacks cash to buy the cheap bitcoins. A lack of bitcoins would follow if MtGox didn't do arbitrage under reverse conditions (higher price at MtGox).
But anyway, nobody knows if they are doing arbitrage or not. While there is no evidence that they are doing arbitrage, there is also none that they are not. People on the outside simply don't know.

Since exchanges are not banks, they should be prohibited from engaging in the business of taking deposits from the public:
[Article 9 Directive 2013/36](
Prohibition against persons or undertakings other than credit institutions from carrying out the business of taking deposits or other repayable funds from the public
1. Member States shall prohibit persons or undertakings that are not credit institutions from carrying out the business of taking deposits or other repayable funds from the public.

These definitions are not bad, as far as they go. But from a legal perspective, it would be more interesting to address these questions:

* Are bitcoins "property" under Article 8 of the Convention?

That might make sense if any of the calculations in the protocol use the 21 million as an input. In that case, staying just under such a limit might speed up things.

Nope. If you talk about theft, there is no need for criminal complaint, police can investigate without that (except for theft from family members).
It is open to discussion if the Japanese criminal law theft statute applies, though. We are talking about information (private keys), which is not a physical thing like a book someone shoplifts in a book store.
There are some cases where people got sentenced for theft for removing some documents containing trade secrets, making copies, and then placing them back. That's also just stealing information.
But, again, there is room for debate about applying the theft statute to bitcoins.

By the way, the [Japanese Bankruptcy Act]( has this interesting criminal law provision in Article 265 Paragraph 1 (prison up to ten years):


If you hold bitcoins in some cold storage wallet, this is necessarily "concealing" that part of your assets. A private key wouldn't be of any use if you don't conceal it.
That may mean that in the event of bankruptcy proceedings, MtGox and its directors need to either sell all their bitcoins or put them into escrow to avoid criminal liability under this provision.

I am waiting for over a week for a test withdrawal of 10,000 yen into my Japanese bank account to arrive. That was surprising to me, since I heard from people at the Tokyo Bitcoin Meetup that they got their money in a couple of days.
Turns out MtGox [said on January 8]( that they are "currently processing withdrawals requested three weeks ago".
I still assume that those 10,000 yen will come through some time later this year. But I would be lying if I said that I was happy with that level of service.

With MtGox down, the Japanese market is up for grabs.

The idea that no one spends bitcoins because they appreciate all the time is easily checked by looking at how much Bitpay processes in real sales. 
If you do that, you'll find that this speculation doesn't hold up to real world data. I heard Bitpay has processed $100 million already.
And if you hold bitcoins and want to keep holding them, just buy additional bitcoins every time you spend some. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:49:55
I understand that they won't allow customers to deposit funds. Instead the business model is like that of the German bitcoin.de exchange. They broker selling bitcoins, the buyer pays the seller directly, and they hand over the bitcoins.
That eliminates the headache for them of getting fiat to sellers, since SecondMarket never touches any dollars in the first place. And it eliminates the counterparty risk (ahem MtGox ahem) for sellers that their money will end up stuck at the exchange.
I also like the idea of restricting business to larger orders. That seems to be a logical thing to do when entering this market.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:06:20
If banks and securities firms will be prohibited from handling bitcoins, that means that Japanese citizens will be stuck with illegal shadow banks like MtGox (which [needed a bank license]( for taking deposits, but did not have one). Such a policy would be a great way to create the next big wave of damage for Japanese consumers.
Also, with such backwards ideas Japan can forget about its goal [declared by the Cabinet last summer]( of becoming the World's Most Advanced IT Country. You can't have that if you are hostile to the most important innovation since the Internet itself.
While Tokyo won the competition for the 2020 Olympics, they will lose the competition to stay relevant as a financial center if they prevent their institutions from even entering the game.

I was not trying to say that the location of paper certificates is the relevant factor. It is not, as you say, under United States tax law. Under [German law]( the relevant factor would be the location of the company in question.
All I was trying to say was that with a paper certificate, a State could base the decision on the location of a certificate, while with bitcoins there is no certificate in the first place.
While Google has headquarters (in the United States) and Germany can base its decision on that, the Bitcoin network does not have one entity running it, and therefore it would be impossible to apply this concept for bitcoins.

So, according to Karpeles, when they "found" 200,000 BTC, the first thing they did was move them to a hot wallet. And then these were "moved automatically" to different hot wallets.
As pointed out by OP's lawyers, it doesn't make any sense to move these coins to a hot wallet. They should stay in cold storage, in a bank vault controlled by the Supervisor, so as to prevent any violation of the restraining order forbidding disposing of debtor assets.
One question that should be asked: What Bitcoin addresses were involved? For the 200,000 BTC "found" as well as for the 650,000 "missing"? Does the debtor even know these addresses the bitcoins were "stolen" from?
If that knowledge becomes public, as well it should, people can help by looking at the Blockchain and finding out what went where when.

To add a bit of detail to this report:
The subject that has said something here is not "Japan", but a study group of Members of Parliament from the ruling party. They have published a Powerpoint presentation with 8 slides explaining that position. You can find it (in Japanese) at MoP Fukuda's [blog post]( here.
They coin a new term that might be translated as "registration of value" (価値記録). That's because they don't want to treat bitcoins as a currency. So they develop a whole new set of rules.
But they propose to do that very cautiously. They want an industry group to start up and discuss self-regulation, in cooperation with relevant Ministries. And while they think that capital gains are taxable, they don't want to require extensive reporting schemes to be set up to catch all the tax evaders out there. They also think that money laundering is not a problem at this particular point. There have been no cases reported of abusing the Bitcoin network for that purpose in Japan.

I don't agree, and this position may change soon, since the government said in the same answer that they don't understand Bitcoin yet.
And actually there is a money transmitting business law, the Payment Services Act. The Japanese government just has not figured out yet that a bitcoin exchange allows people to do payments as well if it allows withdrawals to any Bitcoin address (as opposed to only addresses under control of the customer).

MtGox has taken around $100 million in deposits, though that number isn't actually known to anybody, it's just my guess based on the number of customers they have reported.
That alone is very likely illegal under the Japanese Banking Act (Articles 3, 61).
But combined with their complete lack of transparency, their failure to speak even with large depositors, their failure to process withdrawals manually as long as their automatic withdrawals are down because of their own incompetence, their move to an undisclosed location: That's enough for me to say that they should not be let anywhere close to holding even one single dollar in customers' funds.
There is a reason you can't just open a bank without a license,  and it is that taking a lot of money in deposits from customers means the safety of these funds needs to be guaranteed. I certainly don't feel that is the case here.

The safe way to use any exchange is to buy your coins and then transfer them the next minute to an address you control, preferably a paper wallet. That way you limit the risk of the exchange running away with your coins or going bust to the time frame between your traditional currency getting to the exchange and you getting your coins out, which should not be much more than a day in most cases. And if you buy only in small increments, you can reduce your risk even more.

I'll try to explain it very simply.
Article 2 defines as a bank someone who takes deposits and hands out loans. That's what banks normally do.
Article 3 says that taking deposits without anything else also triggers the "banking" definition.
That's because the moment you take deposits, your customers have counterparty risk. If you could do that without a license, we might end up with 28 year old programmers holding $100 million of customer deposits, but lacking clue one on guaranteeing the safety of funds.

Most interesting observation: Bitcoins are a much more interesting target for criminals than traditional money, since once you succeed in stealing them, there is no way to reverse those transactions.
That in turn means that bitcoin exchanges need even better security than banks, for the same sums of money involved.
It is probably a bad idea to have deposits at bitcoin exchanges in the first place. Just have payments go directly from buyer to seller, and bitcoins over a multisignature transaction directly from seller to buyer. That solves the counterparty risk and removes much of the incentive criminals have targeting an exchange.

Thanks for your replies. Here's a follow up.
You answer that you are aiming for bankruptcy proceedings. If so, your title to this post should be "Plan for MtGox Bankruptcy" (not Reorganization).
And if so, it doesn't matter what the majority of creditors and the court decide in the rehabilitation procedure. If they don't like this plan and everybody gets paid out, you can still offer creditors to invest the money they got paid out in your new exchange. You don't need a majority of creditors, or any MtGox stock, to do that.
At this point, most of this plan is concerned with building a new exchange (possibly a good idea), and none of it with keeping MtGox running.
This of course means you can go ahead and build your new exchange without waiting for what happens in the civil reorganization procedure. That would have the added benefit that everybody understands early on what amount of independent new investment could be secured. Right now the proposal can offer only predictions on that point.
A proposal that involves bringing in new investors is much more convincing if you know already who is going to invest how much, and if you have assured their consent. That's why in the Civil Rehabilitation Act such plans are only allowed under these conditions (Article 158, 165). I think this is a sound principle; it would make your plan much more convincing if you could fill in these blanks.

* File petition with court under Article 30 to order MtGox/Karpeles to reopen website and allow logins, so that everyone can check their balances and trade histories and people can at least prove their losses to their tax authorities.
* File petition to open bankruptcy proceedings against MtGox (not allowed/stayed under Article 39, but should be filed anyway so as to immediately open bankruptcy once civil rehabilitation is closed as hopeless).
* File petition to not open civil rehabilitation because there is no way anyone will trust Karpeles with anything anyway.
* If civil rehabilitation is opened, file immediate petition to discontinue under Article 191, since it is obvious that there will never be a majority of creditors supporting anything Karpeles proposes.
* File criminal charges for violation of Article 259 against Karpeles for shutting down the website, thereby spoiling proof of account balances and trading histories.
* File criminal charges for violation of Article 255 against Karpeles for concealing MtGox property by transferring it to undisclosed Bitcoin addresses, as well as moving funds from those addresses over the last weekend.
* File criminal charges for violation of Article 960 Companies Act (Aggravated Breach of Trust) against Karpeles for taking bitcoins belonging to MtGox and holding them as his personal property.
* File bankruptcy petition against Karpeles.
* File criminal charges against unknown "hackers" alleged to have stolen bitcoins, so as to have the police step in and find out what actually happened to those funds.

Actually, Japan is exceptionally liberal for direct money exchange. Money exchanging between traditional currencies (for example at an airport booth) is allowed to everyone without even a registering requirement since 1998 (it was restricted to banks until then). There are only reporting requirements, especially for transactions over 2 million yen.
The Japanese government doesn't think bitcoins are currency. I disagree, but even if one thinks it is currency, anyone is free to do this.
The Financial Action Task Force found in a recent report that most countries require a license or at least registration for money exchange business. Japan is a notable exception.

One of the oldest altcoins (Litecoin) was built exactly for this situation, to help when Bitcoin couldn't scale fast enough. So now that actually happens, demand for use of altcoins for payment goes up. Why exactly is that a bad thing? Why would having 95% Bitcoin dominance be better? Do you prefer [97% of a $1.5 billion market cap in 2013]( to 66% of a $25 billion market cap now?

Your one transaction is (on average) secured by more than 80 million trillion hashes. It's not reasonable to expect that happening at no cost.
Most of the cost is paid by mining rewards, fees are still only a small part of miner income.
Cost as a percentage of transaction volume is down compared to two years ago, as well as cost per transaction.

The latest short term drop in Bitcoin market cap dominance is caused by the very real threat of splitting the network, not by fees. The market doesn't like the uncertainty of the impending 51%-attack. Fees have gone up, but not to a level that actually reduces demand below supply. Blocks are still full.  
If anything, the high fees show that users value the Bitcoin network even at higher fee levels, as well they should. The idea that a cryptocurrency has more value with less fees doesn't make sense to me. The opposite is true. That's like saying that higher oil prices are bad for Exxon.

While it makes sense to say that money laundering should not be a crime (a matter of opinion), it is completely incompatible with reality to assume it is not a crime right now.
One of the ways Bitcoin can fail is if governments decide that they want to make it illegal. While the blockchain may survive as a payment mechanism for criminals it would certainly not get mainstream in that case.
And if Bitcoin's survival depends on money laundering rules being abolished, the future does not look too promising.

i have read this paper and cited it in an article on Bitcoin and money laundering I just finished (in Japanese). I think many people should read it.
I agree with the main point. Humanity had cash as a private money for just about all of history. Humanity has the ability to use something like cash online for only 10 years.
Let's make sure that ability is not taken away. And while we are at it, let's protect cash against recent tendencies to abolish it.
Of course criminals will use that ability. And of course criminals will be harder to catch and ransom money or hacked funds harder to retrieve.
But the same is true for the Internet as such. We didn't stop its development a couple of decades ago because criminals might use it. 
The same is true for PGP and other encryption tools. We did not outlaw them decades ago because criminals might use them.
I also learned from that paper about the German campaign "Save Our Cash" (rettet-unser-bargeld.de). They are running a petition now, which I just signed. 
Of course if you want Bitcoin to have a larger share of the market for private money, abolishing competition from cash may be a good thing in your view. If in contrast you prefer many options of private money to stay available, the war against cash is a war against freedom and human rights, and anybody interested in Bitcoin for the right reasons should join on the side defending cash.

Thanks, informed comment like this was exactly what I was hoping for, since I don't know much about mining myself.

I'll have a shot at the answer myself:
[Wikipedia says]( that right now mining consumes 1.46 TWh of electricity a year.
At five cents a kWh that's $73 million for only one year and without counting any costs for hardware and miners' profits.
It follows that the cost of building the whole blockchain can't be less than $100 million.

From the point of view of someone enforcing anti-money laundering laws, the best possible result is having criminals think they are moving their funds anonymously, while in fact law enforcement is watching. That is the equivalent of listening in on communications the criminals think are safe because of encryption.
This result is impossible with traditional banking since the criminals know that they are watched there.
I am not sure how to call this situation. Maybe "controlled payment delivery" might work, as an analogy to the term "controlled delivery" used in Article 11 of the [1988 Vienna Convention](

Jimmy Song estimating Bitmain's profits at $200 to 250 million alone from their "BM1387" chip, says ASICBOOST potential of $2 million is small in comparison.
That doesn't include fee income. I just ran some numbers: $250K a day for 365 days, multiplied by 0.167 (16.7% Antpool market share right now). That's around $15.2 million.
If the estimate of $2 million extra profit from using ASICBOOST is correct, it seems that Bitmain has a stronger motive to keep the status quo from the $15.2 million extra fee income than from keeping the ASICBOOST advantage.

I wasn't familiar with the term "true" or "real" full node.
This may have made sense back when everyone was mining with their CPU, and therefore there was no divide between mining and verifying.
Right now, people worry about mining being centralized. If you centralize nodes as well, there's nothing left of Bitcoin's central value proposition  (no need to trust anyone).
It's exactly the other way around. Bitcoin is not the true and real Bitcoin if all nodes go to centralized miners.

For Bic Camera, the tradeoff is having a large majority of honest customers happy because they get served quick versus losing some money to a small minority of scammers who try a double-spend (and have their faces recorded on security camera for later prosecution, if necessary). As long as Bitcoin fraud is a smaller percentage compared to credit card fraud, they come out ahead anyway.

It may make sense to keep prices lower as a tool to drive competitors out of business. But that would also be true at any given time, independent of any new capacity expected.
@_date: 2017-04-02 06:26:28
If you restrict the analysis to fees, having twice the transactions with one tenth of the fees would reduce fee income. No one knows how that would play out.
Anyway, we do seem to agree in the short term analysis. And of course, eventually capacity will increase one way or another. But miners don't have the greatest incentive to speed things up.

Do you know what Slush is running? They may be running their hardware in different configurations proportional to the vote (if they can get BU to run properly). That may be the correct thing to do, if one gives individual miners a vote in the first place.
I think this is interesting because it works as a countermeasure to miner centralization without requiring a change in the proof of work algorithm. If Slush voted as a block without caring what individual miners think, obviously that's much more centralized than what they are actually doing.

Since this is happening in Japan, taking a look at Japanese tax law may be of interest.

Interesting article. The basic problem with Bitcoin governance is that Bitcoin is supposed to be ruled by no one (if you had a Bitcoin King, people would need to trust him). Having no one in charge means more need for discussion, which in turn means that this precedent for moving forward is a good thing (agreeing with you here).
However, the "95 majority required" part may be open to doubt. The activation level is only a measure to try avoiding a chain split, not intended to be a vote. And it is based on the assumption that everyone acts in a reasonable way. If miners show that to be not true, other activation methods will be needed, even if the risk of a chain split becomes more serious as a consequence. The alternative of no way of activating against even small minorities would result in stagnation.

This is an interesting question. The author makes some questionable assumptions, though.
For one, why should the remaining undecided 30% break completely for one side? That doesn't seem to be realistic.
 
Second, Segwit activates at 95%, not 60%. BU has no clear activation path, but 70% of hash rate would just be a hard fork. Said hard fork would run into some problems getting the coin accepted at exchanges. Note that a hash rate majority gives you control over the chain in a proof of work system, but not control over the minds of people who may not like BU.

Fees will be higher than with more capacity.
We will see how high they can get. We will see how that helps altcoins, who get the demand from transactions priced out of Bitcoin.
Gaining some experience with an actual fee market is possible only if both sides continue blocking each other's scaling solutions. Actual data might turn out rather different from what you might expect in theoretical speculation.
Both sides can relatively easily block the other sides' proposal and face large hurdles getting their own idea pushed through. That means the proposal "let's keep the status quo for a while" will win by default.

More transaction capacity is good news for everyone. This headline suggests an increase of 255% (dividing 8885 by 2500 is 3.55).
But this is only one case. What exactly is the capacity increase on average?
Also: The headline says ~2500 transactions per block now, but the relevant chart at blockchain dot info shows numbers oscillating between 1000 and 2200 for the last year, never reaching 2500. The last available number for April 23 is 1602. Compared to that the increase would be 454%.

Clearly Charlie Shrem was not lying when he said that Roger Ver supports BU. No one, including Roger Ver himself, disputes this.
So if there is a "disgusting lie" involved, it can only be the part where Charlie Shrem gives a figure of $500,000 a month.
If the BU project really got $500,000 a month from Roger Ver alone, wouldn't you expect more developers working for the project with better results?

Trying to destroy Bitcoin would not seem to enhance the value of Bitcoin.
Trying to take over Bitcoin will fail. If it does succeed, it will bring price down under $100. 
It is true that the larger part of miner revenue is from the block rewards. And it may help drive value up if Segwit or BU is adopted.
But no one knows exactly when and how much. In contrast, you can read the fee income each day right now in the relevant [blockchain.info chart](
There are multiple miners, with different short term and long term motivations. If you want to know what they think, you would need to actually ask them. But we should be able to agree that in the short term, having higher fees is better for them than having lower fees.

Obviously, if it stopped there, building the Mongolian project does not fix much. The point is that without bitcoin, there is no way to build the wind power before the power lines. With bitcoin, there is. In the long term, the plan is not to stop with generating in the desert, but using the Asia Super Grid to power Japan from Mongolia. But it does take some time to build those power lines.
Bitcoin works as a virtual power line connecting all generators to all markets. That helps accelerate the transition to renewable energy once that is the cheapest option (which it already is now).
In the long term, all fossil fuel power will be replaced by renewable, at the latest after the last ton of coal is burned. The important trick is to get there fast enough.

The original blog that is the object of this counterargument assumes that the price of bitcoin can tell you how much mining equipment is working.
That may lead to a very rough estimate not completely useless. But why not use hashrate instead? That metric tells you directly how much hardware needs to be working at any given time. And it is easily verified by looking at the difficulty. If you are basing your estimate on one particular number, the bitcoin price does not seem to be the best choice.
But the main counterargument is: Actually having lots of bitcoin mining equipment running is a plus for solving the climate emergency. As the cited article notes correctly, this works as an international market for electricity. That in turn means that more renewable projects can be built in remote locations, like deserts with much solar or mountains with much hydro resources, faster.
Japan's richest man is Masayoshi Son, Softbank chairman. His "Asia Super Grid" project wants to build massive wind capacity in the Mongolian Gobi desert and a rather big power line connecting Mongolia, Russia, China, Korea, and Japan. The first wind power is already delivered now and the Mongolian government has given the right of use to an area larger than Tokyo for free.
Such a project obviously benefits if it can sell the electricity right there in the desert, something not easily done without Bitcoin.
If so, Bitcoin is far from being a villain in the warming emergency. It is part of the solution. And since there is no other credible solution in sight right now, this may well be the most important legacy for humanity, dwarfing the privacy and sound money contributions to humanity welfare.

Obviously, running the largest and safest blockchain in history will need many orders of magnitude more electricity than running databases. But this is still the only way proven to have worked for close to ten years to solve the double spending problem. And it is the only shot we have to revert to sound money.
If anyone can show another way to do it that involves using less electricity, I’m all for it. As long as that is not true, the additional energy cost needs to be weighed against the additional benefit of trustless, worldwide sound money.
This weighing is done and should be done by the market. And the answer from the market is obvious. While the price for bitcoins has been known to drop in the short term, mining difficulty only goes in one direction. That direction is up.
If it is true that in a market-based economy it is for users of electricity to decide what they want to use their electricity for, it is true that mining bitcoins is the best use of the over 71 TWh a year digiconomist estimates right now (about 10% increase from May of this year).

Litecoin's use case is cheap transactions with faster confirmation (2.5 instead of 10 minutes) and less hash power security (which doesn't matter much if you only send low value).
Therefore, if the main idea behind a Bitcoin hard-fork is to increase capacity and lower fees for low value transactions, then Litecoin has exactly that covered since 2011. They have a six year track record and now Segwit (and Lightning coming up).
Any hard-fork only motivated by this use case will have a hard time beating Litecoin (which already is a Bitcoin hard-fork).

Falkvinge makes one point that is actually true. Everyone in the debate should be motivated by technical merit. Conflicts of interest should be avoided when that is possible and disclosed when not.
That principle is sound and worthy of support. Even if Blockstream doesn't have any conflict of interest, other companies in the Bitcoin space may have one.
I hear that another company recently admitted in a blog post that allegations of a potential conflict of interest were exactly true as charged, though they mentioned that they were not actually using the potential to profit, being motivated by a desire to act "for the greater good of Bitcoin".
As far as conflicts of interest go, the potential to profit is not much different from actually doing it. If Blockstream said in answer to these allegations "yes, we have multiple undisclosed patents on Segwit, yes we have simulated how we could monetize those patents in discussions with our lawyers, but for the greater good of Bitcoin we are not using these patents just yet", would that remove the conflict of interest?
Not exactly.
So while Falkvinge seems to be misguided in making up patents where there are none and making up a conflict of interest where there is none, he should be applauded for his effort to call for a debate focused on technical merit only.

There's nothing wrong with AsicBoost if everyone can use it. If people buying the BitMain hardware that is ready for AsicBoost insist on getting the necessary software for actually running it, no one has an unfair advantage. That in turn would mean that any motivation to resist Segwit disappears.
So why exactly would anyone buying such mining hardware not require the necessary software? If BitMain doesn't run AsicBoost "for the greater good of Bitcoin", why should their customers be bound to that decision?
And if it is true that the hardware is able to run AsicBoost, can some third party figure out how to actually run it without BitMain cooperation?
While it is certainly a good idea to invalidate AsicBoost over a protocol change, the same conflict of interest solution can be achieved by just removing the advantage of only some miners being able to actually run it.

If you buy gold at bullionvault, they charge you 0.12% a year for storage. Therefore, it might make sense to aim for 0.1% a year of cost of network decentralization.
At present marketcap of $26.5 billion, 0.1% works out to $26.5 million. Divide by the number of nodes the network needs to make sure it is decentralized (for example 10,000). That particular number would result in $26,500 a year per node. Which would be close to the $2,000 a month option in the poll.
In reality, coindance reports around 6,880 nodes right now. If you multiply by the popular poll option of $240 a year ($20 a month), that's $1,651,200, or 0.00645% of market cap. Bitcoin is remarkably frugal with node costs compared to gold storage costs.

I was not discussing future developments, just stating the fact that while fees are higher now, they still only cover 18% of transaction costs.

What, more transactions? Aren't people supposed to stop sending Bitcoin transactions and go to some altcoin or other because of extremely high fees?
Bitcoin transaction space is sold out right now. Activate Segwit if you want more capacity.
"Sold out" is a nice problem to have. And "high fees" is another nice problem (if you are a miner and collect those fees).
I recall a [certain 30,000 bitcoin transaction]( in July 2014 that was sent without a fee (and was confirmed in about an hour at the time). That would probably not be a good idea now. But if you are sending high value transactions, the present level of fees is still a very small percentage.

Everyone should agree that Bitcoin certainly is worth investing in node hardware. Investments in node hardware are far behind investments in mining hardware, which is caused by the fact that you get paid to mine, but you don't necessarily get paid for running nodes.
Everyone probably can agree that an $28.6 billion project should be able to find 10,000 x $10,000 ($100 million) in hardware cost to run the nodes required to keep the same order of nude numbers as now with more capacity.
People will have different opinions if that kind of structure is a good idea. The basic concept of Bitcoin was that everyone would be able to use it with their own resources, not needing to trust anybody else. If you need to sign up with one of those 10,000 high end PC service providers, you're back to square one (trusting some bank or VISA).

You can get free transactions if somebody else pays the significant cost ($10 per transaction yesterday, see chart at blockchaininfo).
Most of the cost is paid for by inflation. That is the mining reward. Every new bitcoin mined dilutes the value of all existing bitcoins. Therefore the mining reward is paid by everyone holding bitcoins. That's not a problem because of the fixed inflation schedule.
A much smaller part is paid by fees.
If you want to get those fees down, you need more capacity. That will add costs of all sorts to node operators. There seem to be different opinions about how much additional cost is appropriate.
But the only way to get your fee cost down is to add costs somewhere else. There is no free lunch. Someone has to pay.
If you want inflation to come down according to schedule (keep the hard 21 million limit), eventually the only way to pay is over fees. While many people don't like the idea of paying for the service they receive and would prefer free transactions, without a fee market the whole system eventually collapses.
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:55:24
Yesterday's fees set a record of $463,190 (data from blockchaininfo).
But yesterday also set a record for funds moved of $600,287,612.
That leaves us at a whopping 0.077% fees for the volume moved. Clearly Bitcoin is going to die tomorrow.
There is nothing wrong with higher fees if the transaction amounts are higher as well. Use Bitcoin for high value transactions, use Litecoin for $5 transactions.
Segwit and/or bigger blocks would lead to lower fees, but since it will still take some time to get Segwit, we will see how much fees can go up before they actually reduce demand for Bitcoin transactions (elasticity of demand).
@_date: 2017-05-08 06:21:28
My metric may be wrong, but it tries to put the cost of nodes in relation to what Bitcoin is worth.

The good part:
If you make a movie, you want all seats in all theaters sold out. Bitcoin is sold out right now. That's a good thing.
Also, transactions cost $12 on average on May 13th (see relevant blockchaininfo chart). Someone has to pay for that. Right now, only a small part is paid by fees, but in the long run, fees are the only source of income for miners.
Obviously most people would prefer to pay no fee or a low fee. But miners need to be paid. And fees won't happen without full blocks.
The bad part: 
Low value transactions are priced out. You need some layer 2 solution for them.
Potential use cases for Bitcoin migrate to some altcoin.
There is more urgency to scale with full blocks than with Bitcoin not sold out.

They pay interest according to how long the Bitcoin are tied up: 1% (yearly) for two weeks. 2% for one month, 3% for three months, and 5% for one year deposit time.
The tweet quotes a Nikkei article about this. According to the article, the Japanese financial regulator (Kinyuuchou) thinks Coincheck doesn't need a bank license because Bitcoin is not a currency, but they reserve judgment on needing regulation later on.
I disagree with them. Bitcoin was set up as a currency and works as the world's most successful currency for the last eight years. Allowing people to set up deposit services without the adequate regulatory protection is a bad idea.
That said, I wish Coincheck the best of luck with their service. Having them fail like MtGox would be bad news for Bitcoin.

The comment tells people to "look at a chart".
If you do that, you will see that the "safe" Euro has lost massively in value against bitcoin just about every year for the last eight years. So this comment doesn't make sense for everyone actually following the advice of looking at the charts.
Thiele (the Bundesbank leader quoted) said something that makes sense as well. He noted that Bitcoin is only a niche product right now, comparing the 350,000 transactions a day to 77 million credit card and bank transactions in Germany alone.
That in turn was his reason to not call for banning Bitcoin.
If you don't approve of banning Bitcoin, the small transaction capacity is actually an advantage for now. Once Bitcoin scales one way or another, that advantage goes away. At Visa scale, Bitcoin will face a completely different level of regulatory scrutiny. Now it is still viewed as a child by many outsiders (at eight years of age not an unreasonable view) and held to lesser standards.
I recall that Satoshi Nakamoto was against using Bitcoin for circumventing the Visa ban on Wikileaks in 2010, since that kept Bitcoin off the radar of regulators longer.
It may make sense now for similar reasons to give Bitcoin another couple of years to grow before it scales to Visa levels.

Context: "You DO NOT represent me" refers to [this tweet]( by Stephen Pair, in conversation with Adam Back:


The first part of that is obviously true. Bitpay is a large part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is also probably true that they have millions of users (I didn't check right now).
So the only thing questionable is the term "represent".
With millions of users it is unavoidable that those users will have different opinions. And someone who objects to Stephen Pair's recent contributions to the scaling debate may not like the idea that Pair is "representing" him.
But should that mean that Pair needs to shut up, or risk losing whatever half of his user base doesn't agree?
I don't think that's a good idea. The logical consequence would be that the debate is left to people who don't have users to lose.
And especially if you are looking for a "User Activated" solution, the last thing you want is to discourage nodes that are large parts of the ecosystem from voicing an opinion.

My idea would be to just drop the "illibitc" part and call them "moin".
That's close to "moins" (meaning less in French, which makes sense for the btc unit with lesser value). 
It is a [friendly greeting]( in some regions of Germany. 
It is easy to pronounce, write, and remember.
I agree with the sentiment that there should be a transition to thinking in smaller units. Even one moin is now worth more than one unit of traditional currencies. It's not very practical any more to display the price of a dollar in bitcoin (0.000454 at the time of this writing).
And it would be a good antidote to the common misunderstanding that you can't buy bitcoin anymore without investing thousands of dollars.

The Japanese financial regulator (Kinyuuchou) says it is not, which is their reason to allow Coincheck to start a business of accepting bitcoin deposits and paying them back with interest. With a currency, you would need a bank license for that (requiring more than 2 billion yen in capital).
On the other hand, Japan will join other countries in stopping to impose consumption tax on selling bitcoin. You don't have to pay $1080 if you buy $1000 worth of Japanese yen (8% tax rate) because there is a clause in the consumption tax law exempting currency.

Therefore, it was enough to point out that you invested your own money in 2012, and that that investment has been rather successful (question 7). As long as investing in Bitcoin is not illegal (it isn't) all the other questions are really not relevant for the purpose noted above.
But just for the record, I hesitate to agree unconditionally that Bitcoin is not regulated by any state.

The problem I have with FinCen is that they think exchanges are money transmitters. That doesn't make much sense. The purpose of MtGox or some other exchange is not to transmit money from person A to person B, or to transmit person A's money from one location to another. It is to exchange money for Bitcoins. Such an exchange transmits exactly zero value from one of the parties to the other.
It was correct to classify systems like e-gold and Liberty Reserve as money transmitters. That is not true for Bitcoin exchanges.
Is the New York Stock exchange a money transmitter?
Would MtGox be a money transmitter if they still dealt in Magic the Gathering cards?
But, as a practical matter of respecting the law in the United States, people who want to serve the American exchange market will have to register with FinCen and get licenses as a money transmitter in 48 States, a very burdensome process that costs a ton of money and will work as a market entry barrier for smaller newcomers, reducing competition in the process.

From a legal point of view, it is actually an interesting question if the European Directive 2003/6 on insider dealing and market abuse is applicable to Bitcoin. Link:
I think it is. This depends on whether Bitcoin qualifies as an "financial instrument". I think it does even now. It will qualify for the very least once the first regulated market (Bitcoin exchange with the necessary license) pops up in the EU.
What that means is for example that spreading false rumors on Reddit would be illegal market manipulation. If someone posts here that the FATF (Financial Action Task Force, the international forum discussing anti-money-laundering efforts) will publish a new recommendation to outlaw the use of Bitcoin in all participating States (made up out of thin air) so as to get some Bitcoin cheap from the ensuing panic selling, that would qualify as market manipulation under Article 1 Nr. 2 c). If Rick Falkvinge writes on his blog that Bitcoin has a goal of $100,000 to $1000,000 without disclosing his position (actually he did disclose), that would qualify under Article 1 Nr. 2 c), last paragraph.
I believe it is required by basic standards of honesty to disclose positions like this. But I also believe it is required already by the Directive, and will certainly be required once somebody wins the race to get the first exchange licensed in Europe.

That is preferable for the government to a system where everybody knows that their transactions can be traced (as with bank accounts, which are always attached to a real name).

There are two possible angles linking Bitcoin and solar power.
One is the fact that with more solar power in the mix, there will be many time slots where there is not enough demand to use all the supply, leading to negative prices (happens more frequently in Germany lately).
Those time slots would be an excellent time to do some Bitcoin mining and get paid in Bitcoins as well as for kindly consuming electricity.
The other point is that the future grid with much solar and wind will need to become much smarter. People will want to sell and buy electricity in a peer-to-peer grid. For that it will help if paying for small amounts of electricity can be handled in an efficient way. Bitcoin will come in handy when developing that smart grid.

Thank you for your comment.
The way this is related to Bitcoin, in my opinion:
Clearly the market for remittances is one of the applications for Bitcoin. That makes the fact that this market has reached $500 billion, more than doubling in the last decade, relevant when thinking about the future for Bitcoin.
As to how Bitcoin could step in to handle Migrant Remittances, I think that right now there is a need to go from traditional money to Bitcoin at the sender's side, and back at the receiver's. Aside from that, Bitcoin would seem to beat any existing service in the market.
I note that this should have been done as a self post in the first place and will do so next time.

As a matter of law, Bitcoin is not a tangible asset, so it can't be just an object of property like a book or a house.
It's information. Undisclosed information. As such it is protected by criminal law against attempts to hack your computer.
It's also a store of value, so again someone scamming you out of your Bitcoin is clearly committing fraud (not theft, which would need a physical object).
And it is a "financial instrument" under EU market regulation laws, which means that people who are manipulating Bitcoin exchange markets are violating the relevant Directive 2008/26/EC, and Bitcoin exchanges need licenses.
You own Bitcoin because everybody involved recognizes the holder of a private key as the owner of the associated Bitcoins. That in turn is based on the contracts associated with buying and selling Bitcoin. Anybody forming such a contract agrees by implication on this basic premise. So while there is no law stating the above "ownership" anywhere, there is a legal base for assigning that ownership. This is the same with domain names, where there is no law assigning the ownership of somerandomweirdname.com to someone who happened to register it first, but a multitude of contracts.

If the problem is the number of withdrawal procedures, you may want to give priority to large sum withdrawals. For example, process the $25,000 withdrawal discussed a lot in comments below before you go to deal with $100 or $200 withdrawals.
"We have problems handling the number of procedures" sounds much more convincing if that does not apply to withdrawals above a certain amount.
Right now your FAQ actually has this backwards, warning that withdrawals over $10,000 take longer than those under the threshold. This may of course be caused by regulatory reasons (AML report requirements); but they are not explained in the FAQ. At least your part of the large amount withdrawals could easily be handled with priority.

I don't understand.
If you look at photovoltaic only, there would obviously be less time slots where demand can't keep up. Negative prices happen now because coal and nuclear plants can't be switched off quickly enough.
It is true that more renewable sources in the mix can help balance the system. It is not true that more sources in the mix can help avoid time slots with too much supply.

There are a couple of interesting questions raised here.
For one, Trace Meyer says Bitcoin private keys are "speech", which would give them Constitutional protection.
I am not sure how a random string of numbers and letters could qualify. On the other hand, you could probably use a string of private key length that actually has a meaning as a private key, and that particular case would definitely qualify.
I don't think that private keys are speech. One reason is that they usually have no meaning. Another is that they are not intended to be disclosed to someone else, certainly not as part of a public discussion, where freedom of speech is most necessary in a democracy.
I agree that one of the problems comes from the fact that Bitcoin is affected by many jurisdictions. That makes it hard to comply with all rules.
I also agree with the idea that the dollar is like common stock of the American government. Bitcoin gives a new alternative, since it is not linked to any particular government in any way. I'm not sure if I would call that a "kryptonite dagger", like Trace Meyer did, but it sure is significant.

Considering the revenue the parties expected for Coinlab according to Article 1 J of the agreement, (only $730,964 after ten years), 50 million damages is clearly a fantasy figure. Including this in Article 1 K gives Coinlab a big incentive to file a lawsuit like this one.

From the MtGox "Terms of Service":
"Members may only have one Account at any one time and may not create or use any Account other than their own. For a Member to be exempt from any of these rules, he/she must request express and prior permission from the Platform. The creation or use of Accounts without obtaining such prior express permission from the Platform will lead to the immediate suspension of all said Accounts, as well as all pending purchase/sale offers."
@_date: 2013-05-05 12:25:53
There is nothing wrong with the contract as such. All MtGox promised with a $50 million penalty attached was not to license to someone else. They have not done that. Even the complaint does not allege anything of the sort.
It would have indeed been a very stupid move to promise with $50 million penalty attached not to serve any of the existing customers in the United States. Alleging that MtGox did exactly that does not convince me.
And they might have been better advised to refrain from putting any $50 million clauses in a contract where CoinLab is expected to have only about $700,000 in revenue 10 years later. It does give CoinLab an incentive to file this kind of lawsuit. Defending against that will cost MtGox a lot of money even if CoinLab doesn't have much of a case and will lose later on.

Let's try to find an honest answer to the question of what backs the value of Bitcoin. He did say that other people may come up with an answer.
I think the recent explanation by Eric Vorhees in his [letter to Peter Schiff]( makes the most sense. 
The value comes from the Bitcoin network infrastructure. Since that infrastructure is growing fast, so does the value of individual bitcoins, which are the only units allowed on that useful network.

@_date: 2013-12-31 02:24:09
A related question is why the value of bitcoins is going up so fast, beating every other asset this year by a large margin.
And part of the answer is that the value of the Bitcoin network has increased a lot this year. Much more users. Much more new exchanges and startups. Over $100 million dollars processed by Bitpay. Over 90,000 subscribers at r/bitcoin. There are lots of other indicators for measuring growth of the Bitcoin network available at [bitcoinpulse.com](
The other reason is that many investors expect the Bitcoin network to grow more in the next couple of years and are paying prices for bitcoins that reflect those expectations.
Anyway, the value comes from the Bitcoin network, where bitcoins are the only currency allowed. As long as that network continues to grow explosively, the value of bitcoins will continue to grow as well.

The nice thing about opening a licensed exchange in the EU is that getting licensed in one Member State gives you the right to operate in all 28 (as of today, with Croatia just joining).
That's in contrast to the United States, where you need to spend lots of money and time to get licenses in every single State.
I also like their approach not to do business with Americans, since that removes a major potential headache. If you start a licensed Bitcoin business, focusing on your home market is a good idea for the first couple of years.
Contrary to the headline, this doesn't seem to be an "exchange" (like MtGox). They are selling and buying Bitcoins on their own behalf, not matching sellers and buyers.

In contrast, no government as of now has tried to shut Bitcoin down (a fortunate state of affairs, in my opinion).
That makes statements like the above by OP pure speculation. I would also like to point to the FATF, which would be involved in this kind of decision. If governments want to shut Bitcoin down, they will do so in an internationally coordinated effort.
This is the single biggest threat that could make it impossible for Bitcoin to reach mainstream adoption. Whoever denies its existence will not even start thinking about how to keep governments from having any desire to shut Bitcoin down.

This is based on a [report at Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]( a major German newspaper, on the answer to a question asked by a Member of Parliament. 
The article reports that in the opinion of the German Finance Minister Bitcoins qualify as "Rechnungseinheiten", which is a term the German law on financial regulation uses with a meaning different from "currency". That means that the headline at Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (and in this reddit link) is misleading.
This position is also not new. BaFin (the German financial industry regulator) has [published before their opinion]( that Bitcoins qualify as "Rechnungseinheiten" (units of account).
The main consequence of that is that the license requirement in Article 32 [Kreditwesengesetz]( gets triggered. If you want to run an exchange like MtGox in Germany, you need a license from BaFin.

Many people dismiss the power of governments to make Bitcoin illegal. This comment does so as well.
If you compare that with cryptography: The only way to prove that any algorithm is strong is to actually try breaking it. He mentioned that a lot of people have tried to break the Bitcoin algorithm without success.
In contrast, no government has yet tried to shut Bitcoin down. As long as things stay that way, any opinion about what would happen in such a case is just speculation.
I personally hesitate to dismiss regulation this easily. If FATF decides to shut Bitcoin down, for the very least important infrastructure like Bitpay, all the exchanges, and the various Bitcoin funds will be shut down. There may be some users left, but it will be impossible to get Bitcoin mainstream.
I agree that the other threats discussed are not serious. That leaves regulation as the single most important issue. People should discuss it in depth instead of just dismissing it like this comment does.

In German law, the corresponding way to handle this kind of case is codified in Article 935 Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code.
That is you will acquire property rights in a banknote even if it has been stolen, except if you either know or are reckless in not knowing of the fact that it was stolen.
The reason for this is that there is an added need for money to be easily handed around without everybody having to worry if someone earlier in the chain stole that particular banknote.
Of course it remains open to debate if this is applicable to Bitcoin in the first place, since Bitcoins obviously are not physical things like banknotes.

The case cited by OP as well as my comment were about civil law issues (who owns a bank note).
Your last post is about criminal law. Forfeiture of assets. Obviously, the government everywhere can under existing law seize any proceeds from crime.
It is not obvious how this will play out with Bitcoin in the mix.

Banks or other institutions are free to connect a Bitcoin account to a person right now. As far as I know there are no banks yet who understand the market potential of offering Bitcoin accounts, but that will probably change soon.
Once a significant number of people stay exclusively in the Bitcoin network, banks will offer Bitcoin accounts as well. That means they, and by extension the government, will know exactly who is the owner of a large subset of Bitcoin addresses.

If you wanted to shut down Bitcoin because of money laundering concerns, you would make it illegal to buy, own, sell, or accept Bitcoin as payment.
And since that would happen in an international concerned effort in all important markets, there would be no place to run. You could forget about Bitcoin ever getting mainstream, though there might be some users left, who would by definition be all criminals.

One of the most interesting questions raised was the last one in the presentation by David Mills, of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He asked, at the very end:


That's interesting, because arguably a service like blockchain.info already is taking deposits. Some people might think of Bitcoins in their online wallet exactly like money in a bank account.
Of course the difference is that the operator of blockchain.info can't use the funds in the online wallets. That means that blockchain.info right now does not need a bank license for their service.
But it will of course be a big leap forward for Bitcoin once the first banks start offering accounts denominated in Bitcoin, with the functionality of an online wallet. The first banks to offer this kind of service will get a lot of business.

But the solution to the non-problem the paper wants to address should find support here. The author wants the IMF to collect part of their funds in Bitcoin. That would of course mean that more Bitcoins would be needed for such a purpose, which would lead to higher valuations.
Also, Bitcoin has already appreciated by a factor of over 10,000 in the last couple of years against all traditional currencies. There was no need for any "speculative attack" for that to happen, and there was no negative consequence for international trade.

1. You get more privacy with Bitcoin.
2. You are done faster. Credit cards require you to fill out a long web form. Bitcoin payments can be done with a couple of clicks.
3. You get a better deal because the merchant passes on his savings on credit card fees (or in the present Bitcoin expansion phase his extra profits from Bitcoin going up on average by a factor of ten a year).

A somewhat easier first step would be to build an exchange in Germany that is actually licensed by BaFin (the German financial sector regulator).
Most people discussing these matters say that *any* exchange in Germany needs such a licence under Article 32 KWG. You need only EUR50,000 in capital to do that, Article 33 Paragraph 1 Number 1 a) "Betreiber multilateraler Handelssysteme".
If an exchange gets that BaFin license, they would run less of a risk to get their bank accounts cancelled. And that would of course help building trust with their customers.
Once such a licensed exchange grows bigger, they can found a bank as a second step.

The interesting thing is that the police is prosecuting for computer fraud. That may be questionable, since they didn't take any Bitcoins from other people but instead used their computers for mining. Just because they made 700.000 Euro in profits doesn't mean that someone else lost that amount. But to establish fraud you need to show that the victims incurred a financial loss (Vermögensschaden), which may be difficult. The loss certainly is not the whole 700.000 Euro, even if there is one.
Right now, there actually may be no rule in the Penal Law against using someone else's computer for mining, as long as you don't take any of the data on the computer in the process.
Basically they were stealing the electricity and the computer power of other people, but the Article dealing with stealing electricity (248c) doesn't fit. And using someone else's computer is no crime either as such.
It's a fascinating case if you are interested in German criminal law...

Yes, that would seem to follow from the Finance Ministry answer (though the tax rate is 19 percent right now). Again, I haven't seen the original source; I might need to reconsider once I can actually read that.
You pay "another 19 % VAT on whatever you buy" also when paying with Euros, so that doesn't change anything for the competition between cash and Bitcoins.
Also, an exchange like MtGox would pay the 19% VAT on their fee income (their turnover), which is 0.6% of the transaction value for anything under 100 Bitcoins in the case of MtGox. 19% of that would be 0.114%, which would fall short of being "devastating".

I am not so sure about the future. I predict that FATF and governments will extend anti-money laundering regulation one way or another to Bitcoin, but I have no idea how they are going to do it, and what the effect of that will be.
I think one interesting thing the FINCEN director said was that 1.6 trillion dollars a year are laundered in the existing system. The whole Bitcoin market capitalization is a rounding error in comparison, which explains that there are no international standard rules recommended by the FATF in place right now. De minimis non curat praetor.
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:54:53
If the FATF (financial action task force) decides that they want to shut down bitcoin because of money laundering concerns, that would be the most probable scenario of for the very least slowing things way down. That in turn depends on how useful bitcoin actually is for money laundering purposes, which in turn depends upon the ability of money laundering authorities to track large money movements in the bitcoin network.
That is not a question easily answered. The money laundering authorities have the advantage that every transaction is open to everyone and stored forever. The money launderers have the advantage that addresses are not easily matched to actual people.
It is open to debate if bitcoin is a better choice for money launderers than cash. I am not sure about the answer yet.
But I think this is the single most probable cause of damaging bitcoin severely.

The writer is right on many of his points.
For one, if he doesn't like making only 3,500% on an investment, he should be glad to leave Bitcoin and stick to the exciting opportunities of mutual funds he seems to prefer.
What he writes about BFL mining hardware seems to be funded in reality. It does seem one-sided, though. As far as I know there are honest people selling mining hardware as well.
It is also correct that there is crime funded with Bitcoin. It is a very different question if Bitcoin is better suited for that purpose than cash or bank transfers. That is a difficult question, and it is the key to discussing the relation between Bitcoin and money laundering regulation.

Counterfeiting is another issue I will discuss. Clearly there is right now no prohibition against counterfeiting Bitcoins. And there probably is no need for it, since the second that becomes possible for anyone, the whole system collapses anyway. In contrast to 10,000 Yen bills, which can be counterfeited with a large investment in skill and equipment, no one can counterfeit Bitcoin in the first place. This is of course, all things equal, one of the advantages of this new currency.

Yes. I think the consumer protection for distance contracts would not change because payment is done in Bitcoin.
I don't think that Bitcoin should be classified as "digital content" under the new Directive, even though the wording of the definition in Article  2 Paragraph (11) might suggest otherwise:
"digital content" means data which are produced and supplied in digital form;"
Bitcoin is data produced and supplied in digital form. But the point of Bitcoin is not using the data as digital content, but as a method of payment and preservation of value. Credit card data is also "produced and supplied in digital form", and it is also not "digital content", in my opinion.

I'm based in Japan (convenient when buying from MtGox).
For one, it would probably make a lot of sense for the Bank of Japan to invest a part of their foreign exchange reserves of [1,275,352 USD Million in November of 2013]( in Bitcoin. Buying all Bitcoins in circulation now would be about 0.62% of that, at $8 billion Bitcoin market cap right now.
It would also be nice if someone would set up a fund like the Winklevoss ETF in Japan. There will be a new tax break in force called "NISA" from January on. People can invest in stocks and pay zero capital gains tax, for a limited amount of investment. Right now I don't think that Bitcoin is an option in that system. It should be. Eventually.
Japanese households [hold assets totaling 1,598 trillion yen as of December 19 of this year]( That's over $15 trillion at present rates.

This is an interesting test case. Let's look at it in some detail:


Obviously, something can't be illegal because there is no law. To make some act or other illegal, you need a law that says so. This is common sense, but also a principle of international human rights law.
Article 11, Paragraph 2, [Universal Declaration of Human Rights] (


Article 39 of the [Thai Constitution] ( gives the same guarantee.
Since a "lack of laws" can't make Bitcoin illegal, that leaves "capital controls".
I have no idea what the Thai law on capital controls may be. But capital controls generally restrict the international flow of funds.
Therefore, it may possibly violate such a statute to transfer funds using Bitcoin from Thailand to another country, bypassing the controls.
However, most of the acts described as illegal in the post don't necessarily involve moving funds into or out of the country.

There are several points against this.
For one, the withdrawal limitations are already gone.
Next, anybody could sell their dollars on MtGox for Bitcoins and withdraw the Bitcoins anytime. That's actually one of the advantages of having Bitcoins in the first place. You don't need to trust a third party to stay in business.
Third, MtGox has been in this business since the early days. If you think they didn't get rich enough to pay a couple of lawyers from the substantial increase in Bitcoin value since said early days, maybe you need to find yourself something else to write about.
Last, writing this kind of speculation without even bothering to ask MtGox for comment is for the very least a very reckless thing to do, certainly not helping the Bitcoin economy in any way. Under German law, it is potentially illegal and could expose the author of this piece to civil claims based on [tort law](
That said, MtGox probably should address some of these concerns. More transparency is good for them. They could disclose how much money was in the frozen account, and what kind of legal expenses they are dealing with.

This is a completely valid criticism at this particular point. It does require some effort to get verified at some exchange or other.
The bright side of course is that nobody will be able to steal your Bitcoins until you actually got some. The fact that this happens a lot right now (it you don't study security) is another weak point of Bitcoin at this particular time.
Another bright side is that you need to go through verification procedures only once.

That assumes you are mining with dirty electricity produced by burning stinking fossil fuel. That won't be true in the future, since if miners use electricity at the scale he speculates about, they will go where the electricity is cheapest. Right now that would probably be at locations with excellent hydro resources. In the future large-scale non-hydro projects may beat that price.

Bitcoins are not like Pokemon cards or any other collectible, which has value only because and as long other people think it has value. It has value as a means of payment and value storage backed by the biggest collective computing power on the planet.

And I agree completely with Patrick Murck that the ideas presented in the March 2013 FinCen guidance are rather peculiar.
But I don't see how the mere act of mining qualifies under that guidance. As I read it, a miner becomes a money transmitter the moment they sell a Bitcoin they mined to someone else. Note that I don't think this makes any sense, but that's the way I read the guidance. For your convenience, here is the part where it talks about miners:

I understand that a person might feel uncomfortable with a paper wallet, if you never actually use it and have trusted some other person with providing the software (I use the one at bitcoinpaperwallet.com).
The solution to that: I just yesterday logged into blockchain.info, and swiped one of those wallets completely. Then I sent the balance to a new paper wallet I printed in advance.
In other words, to get rid of the (unfounded) fear that your paper wallet will actually become only paper and no wallet, just try this exercise for a few rounds.

This is indeed a serious risk. Figuring the regulation out will be one of the most important tasks for Bitcoin if it wants to go really mainstream.
Fortunately, while Bitcoin can be used for money laundering, so can cash. And in contrast to cash, all transactions are open to anyone, and can be traced for eternity. That makes Bitcoin actually less suitable for money laundering than cash, or bank transfers using banks outside of the reach of the FATF (financial action task force).
To help dealing with this problem Bitcoin exchanges should get the necessary licenses. In the United States, FinCen guidance from March indicates that exchanges are a "money transmitter business". The German regulator BaFin would seem to require Bitcoin exchanges to get a license as an exchange for "financial instruments".

This answer is from the "Bundesministerium der Finanzen", which they translate as "Federal Ministry of Finance". It is in answer to an official question by Member of Parliament Frank Schäffler, which is why it is published on his website.
There are two questions, and two answers.
One is if dealing with Bitcoins (for example running an exchange) is free of VAT und [Article 4 Number 8]( of the VAT law.
The answer is yes, under letter c), which says that dealing with "Forderungen" may be tax-free.
"Forderung" means a claim by a creditor against someone. If A loans B 50.000 Euros and A wants to sell that claim to some third party, anyone dealing with claims like this doesn't need to pay VAT for their revenue.
In contrast, in the opinion of this answer, Bitcoin is not a currency under Article 4 Number 8 b).
I think this is good news for anyone running an exchange in Germany. I also think it is completely wrong.
Whatever Bitcoin is, owning a Bitcoin certainly doesn't mean owning a claim against some obligor.
There are actually two different questions here, which the answer does not distinguish.
One is the question if an exchange needs to pay VAT on the value of every Bitcoin it sells. At 19% right now, someone like Bitcoin.de would need to pay around $100 per Bitcoin right now.
The other question if an exchange needs to pay VAT on the fee income. In that case the amount would drop to 19% of whatever they charge in fees. For example, if an exchange charges the 0.6% MtGox does, that would be 19% of those 0.6%, or at $542 MtGox price right now about 60 cents, which would not have much of an impact on a $542 deal.
The second question answered by the Ministry: Do people have to pay VAT if they just use Bitcoin as a payment. To explain this with some examples:
A consumer buys a car for 20.000 Euros and pays in Bitcoin. He would not need to pay VAT for his Bitcoins in the first place, since only the car dealer is an enterprise. Consumers don't pay VAT.
In contrast, the car dealer buys 50 cars for 1.000.000 Euros and pays with Bitcoin.
Now this answer says that the mere payment is not taxable under Article 1 VAT law in the first place, so there is no need to discuss an exception under Article 4.
I agree with that. Paying for some good with Bitcoin doesn't change a sale to a barter contract.

Thanks. Doing that shows very low trade volume at high price (I haven't checked that part).
Which probably proves that you can sell at low volume with a high percentage markup. There may be a business case for selling Bitcoins on paper wallets for cash in low volume.
That would actually be faster than having someone new to Bitcoin install an application and receive a transaction.

So, will they sell these coins immediately?
I mean, if they keep them, they would expose themselves to allegations of conflict of interest every time they speak up for Bitcoin. Or, they may refrain from speaking up in the first place because they would like to avoid allegations like that.
I for one think that they should keep the Bitcoin (since I expect the value to go up some more). And they should just disclose the fact that they own some every time they say something related.
They also should disclose, in regular intervals, how much Bitcoin they received since they started accepting them again. That information should have been in that particular blog post. If anyone from EFF is reading this thread, it should also be posted here.

If you read Buffett's autobiography, you will find that he made some money early on by betting on new payment technology (credit cards).
Later on he became more conservative. He missed the whole Internet bubble since he wasn't willing to invest in something he doesn't understand.
But one important advice he gives is to look for the long term. He's not interested in what will happen next week or next month. He is looking at what will happen in the next ten years.
That's an excellent perspective when discussing Bitcoin as an investment.

That's definitely not the normal way to buy them, which shows that Stallman doesn't know much about Bitcoin. But his point is valid anyway: For most methods to buy Bitcoins, you need to attach your name to the transactions, at least if you are using an exchange for buying. That probably means that law enforcement can figure out for a lot of addresses who owns them, which means that Bitcoin is not anonymous (Stallman's point).
This in turn means that there is so much less of a case for completely banning Bitcoin because of money laundering rules. The case for making Bitcoin illegal would be much stronger if it actually was anonymous, which it is not. All transactions are open to everyone, and the data is kept forever.

Actually, the bitcoinvanity site I quoted has set up a clever way of finding the firstbits address you want without knowing the private key themselves.
But short of such a scheme, there is no way to know, which makes it even more valuable to be the first to get any valuable string, especially if you plan to use it for a company or product where you own the trademark registrations.

Your number of 7,975,451,400 ounces of gold means there are about 380 ounces of gold for one Bitcoin (dividing by 21 million). That means that if Bitcoin was valued like gold, one Bitcoin would need to be the same price as 380 ounces of gold (substantially more than present valuation).

For several reasons, I like the idea of using only one address for at least some of my transactions.
How is that done? I have still to choose which client software I want to use. Can they all do this? Can one of them do it with less hassle than the other ones? Is there one that doesn't have these confusing multiple addresses in the first place?
As someone new to Bitcoin, I completely agree with the sentiment that forcing address changes as a default adds another layer of confusion and complexity. Bitcoin is difficult to use already without that. I also understand you can actually lose Bitcoins because of this, for example if you don't spend the whole balance from a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-05-06 10:16:13
Bitcoin addresses are like bank accounts. Except anybody can open them, with no ID check required.

Yes, that is clearly a false statement.
It also very open to debate if Bitcoin is not regulated in the European Union, as that presentation asserts. While it is true that it is not "electronic money" under the relevant Directive, Bitcoins are "financial instruments". That means that Bitcoin exchanges need a license (similar to the license requirement clearly in place in the United States), and it means that the Directive against market abuse applies to Bitcoin markets.

I agree. What I was trying to say was: 8 billion would buy all Bitcoins at present market levels, if everybody was ready to sell them at that price and if there were no lost coins.

Professor of EU law here.
As it says at the "sommaire" (summary) part, this is a national law to transpose Directive 2009/110, which is about "electronic money".
Article 2 has this definition of "electronic money":
 "'electronic money' means electronically, including magnetically, stored monetary value as represented by a claim on the issuer which is issued on receipt of funds for the purpose of making payment transactions as defined in point 5 of Article 4 of Directive 2007/64/EC, and which is accepted by a natural or legal person other than the electronic money issuer;"
Bitcoin is not electronic money under the Directive, since there is no issuer. This Directive is about things like prepaid cards for local subway fares. E-gold would have qualified as well, before the American government shut them down.
This kind of transposition of the Directive has to happen in all 27 Member States. Nothing new to see here.
The interesting question from the regulation point of view will be what the Financial Action Task Force says in their next recommendations, once they notice that there is this new "Bitcoin" currency. Their last recommendations are from February last year, and they don't mention Bitcoin yet.

Agree, as far as that goes.
The interesting question then is: Should it be assumed that coins are received in good faith if they are on a blacklist.
I don't know the answer to that yet. It would seem to depend on a lot of things that still need to be worked out. And I don't really understand the technical background well enough.
But I know that I have zero problems with seizing illegally gained funds from people receiving them in bad faith, as well as prosecuting them under money laundering laws. Everything else would just help criminals to get away with their illegal profits. That would certainly not contribute to making Bitcoin a success. If people insist that Bitcoin needs to help the criminals, that would be a major point against the whole idea and for making mining, owning, trading or accepting Bitcoin as illegal as printing counterfeit money is right now.

I posted this for a couple of reasons.
For one, it shows the difference in scale between dealing in traditional currencies and Bitcoin exchanges. MtGox is at much less than $164 billion a day.
Next, if one looks at what regulations are necessary for exchanges, it makes sense to look at what someone like EBS has as a regulatory framework.
And finally, once banks start offering Bitcoin accounts just as they offer traditional currency (dollar, euro, yuan or yen) accounts, Bitcoin exchanging will eventually be handled by EBS as well. That would be good news for Bitcoin. So I posted this as a goal for the mid-term future.

About the revocability point.
Actually it's impossible to sell Bitcoin accepting credit card payment, because many buyers fraudulently abuse their ability to revoke the payment.
There is no reason to assume that only one party to the payment (the seller) may try some kind or other of fraud. Actually, most sellers need to make their name and address known better than most buyers. In the EU you can't do any business on the Internet without disclosing your name and address. Which of course means that the ability to revoke payments will lead to more fraud, not less.
It is also much easier to use somebody else's credit card for an Internet payment than somebody else's Bitcoins. In a contest between Bitcoin and credit cards on safety against fraud Bitcoin should win.
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:59:12
A couple of preliminary comments.
For one, the complaint states that MtGox promised exclusivity to Coinlab, and I cite from the complaint:
"shall not grant anyone else the right to use the Licensed Materials to provide Bitcoin exchange services".
They then complain that serving customers from the United States is in some way infringing on that exclusivity. This does not seem to be a valid complaint. Serving a customer is not "granting the right to use the Licensed Materials".
The plaintiff lawyer then writes this. He really does:
"The Agreement provides that beach of the exclusivity provisions of the Agreement alone provides for liquidated damages in the amount of $50,000,000.00 as a non-exclusive remedy. The liquidated damages clause was defined at the time of the Agreement because of the uncertain nature of the Bitcoin exchange market and likely underestimates the actual damages incurred by Bitcoin as a result of Mt. Gox’s breach of the exclusivity provisions of the Agreement."
Damages incurred by Bitcoin. Who is Bitcoin, and why can they incur damages? And why would damages incurred by Bitcoin be of any relevance for calculating damages of the plaintiff, called CoinLab?
If the plaintiff wins the lawsuit in the United States, they may come to Japan and ask a Japanese court to confirm the judgment. That would be necessary if they want to use said judgment for any execution in Japan.
I wonder if they have thought about their chances to get that done.
If they do succeed with that, we might see the interesting question addressed on how someone executes a judgment by seizing Bitcoins.

They should send you a postal letter to your address. Then you can send them a scan of that letter as proof. That should always be an option.
Until they introduce that, you can always write a simple translation on the margin. I am based in Japan as well and know that part of the address in the utility bill is in numbers easily readable to people who don't read Japanese.
Edit: Also, when I recently verified with MtGox, I sent them a scan of my Alien Registration Card, which also proves my address, even better than the utility bill.

There is also a Directive on distance selling of financial services. 
It should apply as well to Bitcoin. Buying some Bitcoin can be classified as an "investment" under the definition in Article 2 b). 
If so, that means that exchanges like Bitstamp need to provide the minimum of information required in Article 3 of the Directive. A right of withdrawal will not kick in, though, since the price of Bitcoins depends on fluctuations of the market (Article 6, Paragraph 2).

As far as I am aware, there is no law specifically prohibiting buying Bitcoin in Germany right now.
If one wanted to commit a crime by sending money to a Bitcoin exchange under present German law, one would need to look at Article 261 of the penal law (Strafgesetzbuch), which prohibits money laundering.
You would need to find some funds obtained by illegal activity (for example illegal drug dealings). Then send that to the Bitcoin exchange with the intent of laundering those funds. That would do the trick. However, probably no one would bother to do that with a small sum like EUR500.
That means OP might want to refrain from speaking to the police if he is in the money laundering business. He would be entitled to do so under Article 55 of the German Code on Criminal Procedure. And if the police wants to talk to him as a suspect, they need to inform him of that fact first, Article 136.
If in contrast OP has invested legitimate funds, I don't see why there is any problem in talking to the police. They might know where the money is and how to get it back.
Actually, witnesses have a duty to help investigations, except if they would implicate themselves or know about the facts in question from their professional work as a lawyer, journalist, priest, doctor etc, Article 161a. The police can, in principle, force people to talk as a witness.

The paper wallet I printed with the software from bitcoinpaperwallet.com has this warning printed on it:
"When withdrawing your funds from this wallet you should remove the ENTIRE BALANCE. If you attempt to spend only some of the funds, you will likely lose the remaining bitcoins forever".
It follows that what you described is exactly the right thing to do. I intend to use paper wallets in the same way.
The "change wallet trap" is something I don't understand either. It seems that is a feature designed to help privacy by changing addresses frequently. If you don't mind having some transaction traced by third parties, the risk of losing bitcoins because of this feature outweighs the gain in privacy.
Maybe there is some way of spending part of a paper wallet balance without using the change. It would be interesting to know. But anyway, this is a risk users of paper wallets need to be aware of.

I agree that Article 39 is not intended for Bitcoin, being written about twenty years ago. I agree that it is intended for trade secrets.
But there is undisclosed information in the Bitcoin system (private keys). And Article 39 Paragraph 2 would seem to require TRIPS member states to provide some form or other of protection.
I am asking this since I am trying to understand what a Bitcoin actually is from a legal point of view. Since it is only information, and secret information (the private key), I am interested in comparing it to other cases where secret information is legally protected.
And I personally think that private keys *are* undisclosed information under Article 39, and under Article 17 of Germany's law on unfair competition, which is Germany's law to transpose Article 39 TRIPS.
As a consequence, someone working for some Bitcoin company in Germany would be criminally liable for leaking private keys of that company to a third party, and anybody would be criminally liable if they stole a paper wallet from such a company or hacked some German Bitcoin company's computer to steal Bitcoins online.

I think the analogy to the public record system for houses is interesting. However, maybe the better analogy would be to the records of a bank showing $1,372 in a bank account. As long as those dollars are not withdrawn at the counter, they only exist as a record in a database, identifying an owner. That record is just information. You can't put the information in your pocket.
Actually, it is the other way around. People *do* put bitcoins in their pockets (in the form of paper wallets), while they don't put copies of their bank balance statements there. That's because the paper wallet has authorization power, while the copy of the bank database record does not prove ownership.

Most interesting part was this:


from any funds you may have held on the exchange platform, even when the exchange is registered with a national authority. 
That's interesting for two reasons. For one, many exchanges and online wallets receive deposits in fiat and Bitcoin from their customers. One could ask why that fact doesn't make them banks, with the consequence that they would need bank licenses. It is interesting to note that the EBA says they are not banks.
And the answer to this particular risk in the mid-term would be to work together with banks when running an exchange, or found banks for that purpose. Once Bitcoin online wallets and exchanges get bank status and included in deposit guarantee schemes, Bitcoin will be much closer to getting mainstream.

Bitcoin is open source software. As such it will follow the majority. It is not possible for an open source project to have some (which?) features that will be protected for all time against what a majority of users want.
I may be wrong, but there seems to be nothing in the protocol to stop people from voluntary disclosing addresses, and other people from adjusting their actions on whether they know or don't know who owns an address.
And there are certainly legitimate use cases where you want to know who exactly you are dealing with. The most obvious is the case where you want to pay to some person A some sum and want to be sure that the address you are paying to actually belongs to that person, as opposed to someone who just hacked your computer and made it display a wrong address.

"Print more" Bitcoin...
Someone tell this author that there is no way to do that.

I am aware of this flaw of Bitcoin, which is called the "change trap", but thanks for bringing it up anyway. It means that it is a bad idea to spend only part of the balance of a paper wallet if you don't know what you are doing.
That flaw however is only the default of many clients. One can override it, or use a client that does not add this additional layer of confusion and, as you point out, the risk of losing bitcoins. I understand that I can use the online wallet at Blockchain.org with my address always the same, which is why I am going to use nothing else.
Anyway, even if you can't for some reason spend only part of your balance, that doesn't change anything for the question what a bitcoin is. It is just the balance of the address in question.

Thanks. 
So the correct answer is "hope it doesn't happen". That makes sense, since finding a double address by chance should be as difficult as finding the private key to some public address you know by brute force.

I am a lawyer, and this would seem to be fraud, not theft.
It is kind of a stupid thing to do. Why get yourself a criminal record for the grand sum of 1.5 bitcoin? And why drive away with a car? Cars have license plates...

Satoshi will use his $94 billion stash in 2023 to solve global warming...

So there is a currency where one unit is worth more than 1 BTC (gold). I am not aware of anybody else left. Bitcoin has already beaten silver.
