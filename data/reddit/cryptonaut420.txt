Prices were fairly close to what they were today actually, Gox collapse happened barely 2 months after the BTC all-time-high (&gt; $1000). Karpeles let trading continue for a couple weeks before admitting that   the coins were gone, basically intentionally crashing the price as low as possible before fully pulling the plug so he could claim a lower loss.

Sure, "beacons can broadcast routes", but that is meaningless and doesn't actually explain the process. If I have a few BTC locked up in one channel, and someone else in a completely different channel (but mystically connected somehow through LN) wants to send me 100 BTC.... how does that 100 BTC get to me without the other side (i.e the hub) of MY channel already having 100+ BTC prepared and locked in? You can't just add new BTC into the channel without closing and reopening it first, or can you?

meaning it doubles every two years, but its not in steps (e.g 2mb for 2 years straight, then suddenly 4mb). So actually each new block allows for slightly more space making the increase smooth over time.

In a community moderated environment like reddit, moderators should only step in when someone is explicitly breaking rules (e.g doxing), or to delete spam etc.. In more traditional forums, moderators are the only recourse. We can either let you go on and on filling the forums with annoying crap, or we can put an end to it. You can call that censorship if you want, but why wouldn't we just delete all those threads and pretend it never happened, rather than leaving it all out in the open and continuing to respond?

Id be interested to hear about what miners think of this: 
it's essentially 2MB now, 4 MB in 2 years, we get to have a bunch of upgrades first, and it keeps doubling linearly until 8GB in 23 years from now. Best of all worlds IMO

@_date: 2015-12-27 00:45:37
For those that are too lazy to read the whole thing:
* Finish/implement a variety of upgrades such as pruning, thin/weak blocks, segregated witness (hardfork version), libsec256k1 etc... aim to have these done within 6 months (mid 2016). Exercise the network's hardfork capability (which is primarily an efficiency upgrade, no changes in resources required)
* Plan for an additional hardfork 6 months or so later which is strictly about the block size limit, using a modified version of BIP101
* Block size starts off at 2MB and then doubles every two years.
* Block size still ends at 8GB, but with a few more years added to the timeline - 2039. 
* Attempts to balance factors such as miner fee revenue (transitioning away from block subsidy - one of the most important factors), propagation time, orphan rates, bandwidth costs, storage costs, cost to setup and maintain a full node, as well as user adoption and utility (low cost transactions). 
* Uses known trends in improving technology, keeps things at similar (or better) levels than they are today, which we know is working. Allows us to scale to (hopefully) global adoption / mass usage over the next few decades
* Bunch of improvements get made first (along with a "practice" hardfork), block limit is not increased as aggressively immediately, but still sufficiently increased. Everybody wins, except for those obsessed with fee markets. 
* Bitcoin 1.0 launched.
**tl;dr tl;dr**
Basically BIP101 but slightly nerfed at the start, and a combination of other upgrades to keep everyone happy.

Haha yeah, not the case at all man. Your bitcoins and all your transactions would still be perfectly valid. All that would happen is you wouldnt be able to see any new transactions come in due to technically being on a different network, and anything new you send would appear to never confirm. Until you upgrade then it would all go back to normal, anything you thought was missing would show back up etc.. Even better, if your using a spv wallet (like most people)  instead of your own full node, you wouldnt even notice anything happen, it would just continue to work.

Turns out there are actually steps in between going from 100,000 transactions a day to serving hundreds of millions or even billions of transactions a day (which is the endgame goal for BTC). One of those steps is increasing network capacity to support more than 100,000 transactions per day. If a handful of nodes shut down because of it, then so be it. Others will take their place eventually and no one will bat an eye. 
The lightning network also needs a higher block limit in order for it to support bitcoin "going mainstream", so that argument doesn't hold either. Pretty sure the millions of $ in funding that blockstream has received is a far better incentive (especially in the short term) for them to build it out than the prospect of rising transaction fees in a limited system and everyone complaining about their transactions taking forever.

Fair enough, but then who should decide it? The whole idea is to take the decision away from the developers, because everybody just ends up arguing in circles over a specific number. Let the network decide.


Ok, well I hope it is only used like that, because the way it comes across especially given the current context and how fast this post was rushed out, seems more of a political statement than anything. If there are ACTUALLY developers changing their software to be specifically incompatible with the current chain before network consensus is reached, then yeah that is one thing... but we have not seen one case of that.

@_date: 2015-06-02 01:40:36


Your assumption of my assumption is incorrect, and that is not an argument for keeping the 1MB block limit. 
I understand the logic of "larger block limit = more potential resources being used up = more expensive to run a node = less incentive to run a node = more centralization"... but it just doesn't check out.
For one thing, there is no and never has been an incentive in the first place to run a node, except for if you are a business or developer or whatever who actually needs access to their own copy of the blockchain. And if you are a business who needs their own copy of the blockchain, then an increased block limit is not going to change that. 
Secondly, running a node has ALWAYS been a big resource hog. The node count has dropped so rapidly because as soon as there was better and more convenient options to use bitcoin instead of running bitcoin core and downloading the blockchain, people flocked to it. Not a big surprise there. 


That is my point actually, businesses that need the blockchain will continue to host the blockchain because they need it. It's just a cost of business. 
The way I see it, the logic is more like "more room for transactions = more businesses using and building off the blockchain = more businesses running their own nodes = greater decentralization". 
Sorry, but the days of most people running nodes on their home connections are gone and never coming back. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:26:00

There has been a few times where people have accidentally paid ridiculous huge transaction fees (usually when trying to create a raw transaction, and screwing up big time). I don't remember hearing about anything like that from last month but I know things like that have happened a few times.
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:50:40
wow really, wtf? Have a link to that? 
So, I wonder what the current total number of nodes is, using the old bitnodes algorithm which counted non-inbound accepting nodes? Would be better to compare that number to previous statistics since apparantly we don't even know the amount of actual full nodes that existed before. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 01:33:00
To add to that, notice how when they say things like "nobody but gavin and mike think this is a good idea!", what they really mean is "out of the ten or so people we think matter, only two of them are for this idea" (even though several of the opposing side are business partners or have some other motiviation - e.g luke jr craziness). As if nobody else in the community knows anything about bitcoin, so they don't get to have an opinion I guess. 
The sad thing is this has been going on for years... people say "oh they had these views before blockstream so its not a conflict of interest"...yet maybe there is a reason they created the company in the first place? Didn't just happen at the moment they got funding you know.
Time to ditch Bitcoin Core soon I think and let consensus play out the hard way.

Sounds reasonable enough, if that's what it takes to get people to agree than sounds good to me. 8X increase still gives us some serious headroom to keep things running smoothly and implement better solutions over the next 2 - 5 years or maybe even more. We need to buy ourselves time to improve scalability, not try and force a rushed solution once bitcoin becomes barely usable for most people.

....no, I don't think you understand. Bitcoin Core is an open source project on github. The people that "own" it / control it are a mix of independent developers and people working for different companies. There is no company called Bitcoin Core which owns the project and pays people to work on it, and the bitcoin.org website is an informational website about the bitcoin *protocol and network*, and **not** the Bitcoin Core github project. Those are two separate things.

I find it hard to believe that there was actually 350,000 **full nodes** back then.. as in people who are specifically port forwarding 8333 to allow for more than 8 connections. Are we sure those numbers are accurate? 
*edit* actually reading the comments on that twitter post... what the fuck?


seriously? Do you have memory loss or something? There absolutely was not **hundreds of thousands of people** abandoning running a full node with bitcoin core because of satoshi dice.

@_date: 2015-06-16 14:47:17
Seems like you are just getting overly emotional about the whole anti-Gavin/Mike train and are now doing anything you can to "protect bitcoin". Sorry, bitcoin does not need your protection, and this blog post does absolutely nothing, except for maybe show your true colours.
Bitcoin.org is mostly a resource for noobies, and I bet you anything almost all of them that see this will just think "what the fuck does any of this even mean? I have no idea what is happening". Your just going to end up confusing people, and are already antagonizing things further by threatening to exclude devs  because they dared to suggest making a change to the protocol..
So, if an exchange, or wallet service provider etc. states publicly that they are planning on switching from using Bitcoin Core to BitcoinXT, does that mean they are going to be banned from bitcoin.org? Yes or no answer please

Realistically, it is going to be well over 90% of the hash power. Nothing has even been released yet and we are already seeing mining pools representing over 50% of the current hash rate signing off on 8MB blocks. I doubt it is going to take 9 months just to convince another 25% to join on. Also if all the exchanges, all the payment processors, the block explorers, the main wallet providers.. they are pretty much 100% going to upgrade ASAP (most of them have stated their support for increase block size). For people that don't upgrade, where are they going to use their coins? For miners that don't upgrade, where will they sell?

We are not talking about 10GB blocks, we are talking about somewhere in the range of 1 to 20MB blocks. Completely different. By the time we have gotten to 30 MILLION transactions per day in the blockchain (which is what 10GB implies, roughly... and remember, we are only at 100,000 right now), yeah, I am pretty sure 10GB will not be that big of a deal.

So... You support a "one off increase" to kick the can down the road for a few years to buy some time for lightning etc.? Why didn't you just say that to begin with instead of putting up this huge fuss about raising the limit and doing a hard fork?
Also, you don't seem to acknowledge that your basically saying every wallet implementation, all bitcoin based services and programs need to be rebuilt to accommodate   the lightning network, scrap how everything is done now and then the blockchain just becomes a purely payment hub settlement database. Somehow I don't think that is going to happen
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:22:53
The logic is not that complicated at all really.
Imagine for a second that Coinbase, Bitstamp, BTC-E, Bitfinex, OKcoin, Kraken, Local bitcoins, Cavirtex etc. all decide they want to support a larger block size limit (hint: at least 2 of these companies have already publicly stated that they do - and none have come out against it). It is in their best interest for them to all agree and take as little risk as possible, for exactly the reason you are talking about (spending coins on each chain), and it would be chaos for them. ALL OF THEM will lose tons of money if they do not all stick together. 
So, where does every miner get their income to continue paying for their operations? Where does every single bitcoin accepting merchant obtain cash from their hard earned sales? Where does everyone purchase their bitcoin, or cash out when they need the money? Thats right, the exchanges. 
It really does not matter what the core devs think, or what the miners think, or what the handful of node operators think. Everyone is in this for the money, if all of a sudden there is no where for the miners to cash out, or for the merchants to cash out, etc. etc.... pretty sure they are going to suck it up and go along with the change, because they would like to stay in business. 
Sure, there might be some smaller exchanges that try and stick with the 1MB limit, but they have barely anything in liquidity, so good luck trying to dump and significant amount of coins on there. 
Check out this post: 
If you want to still be able to use your bitcoin at all of the merchants that you can now, and if you want to still be able to turn your bitcoin into cold hard cash... then you are going to go along with the &gt;1MB block size change weather you like it or not.

did some quick math - if each transaction is average 350 bytes, and 144 blocks per day, that would mean the max the network could handle without needing another hard fork is around 160 transactions per second. nice increase from the 3 - 7 tps we are stuck with today I'd say

I'm curious about this to. I have seen a few of these merchants saying that they ran A/B tests which showed simply having BTC as an option lowered their sales, but how extensive was that testing and how many different tests did they run?
For instance, similar thing happened when Mozilla added a BTC donation option, which they took off pretty quick do to running an A/B test and finding the same thing. Except... in their implementation, rather than having BTC just show as one of the payment options, they added some text in the corner of the form that just said "Donate with Bitcoin". As a dumb user who might not be paying attention very well, I could totally see someone seeing that and getting confused saying "oh, so I have to donate in this bitcoin thing? uhh.. nevermind then". It might have been a different story if it was placed differently, or if like you said they try taking off another payment option to balance things out. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 02:46:16
No, what it is saying is that they will exclude any service or wallet that supports a controversial fork, which obviously in this case means anything over 1MB, which you guys refuse to budge on. Even apparently  jgarziks proposal which IMO is the best so far is being shut down because it still changes the status quo. 
This whole statement on bitcoin.org is totally premature, there isn't even any code released yet which anyone is pushing as a valid fork we should switch to, and even then any fork is going to be scheduled well in advance and only will take effect when a majority of the network has already agreed to it. The actual hard fork happening already implies there being a majority consensus, and the few left behind will either follow or.. be left behind. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:48:50
32MB is a legacy technical limitation that has always been around. Basically, the system cannot send packets across the network greater than 32MB, unless some major overhauls to the network architecture  are also made. I don't actually know the specifics, so someone correct me if I'm wrong
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:06:57
No, there is nobody sitting around waiting for the right news article to come out before they start buying and using bitcoin. If anything, adoption and price are what drives the news, not the other way around. 
People only think every news story is the cause of price movement because back in the days of Mt Gox, there really were tons of speculators sitting around making buys and sells at a moments notice whenever they see a positive or negative story about BTC. The collapse of Gox pretty much put an end to that, and even then, the previous price rises were not exactly direct indicators of how much adoption we have. Right now, bitcoin is used by more people than ever before, and yet the price is pretty far below the all time high.

What are you trying to say, that I should be cashing out of bitcoin and calling it quits or something, and telling everyone to stay away, because of the block size issue? Not sure what you are getting at.
For the record I have *never* been an investor.. I bought like 100 bucks worth one time when it was around 10 bucks a piece, which I then lost to gambling within like a week or two (lesson learned). Unlike some other people around here, I don't have thousands of dollars to speculate with, and have just been trying to make ends meet. 100% of the rest of the BTC I have ever had has come from earning it, mostly via doing contract programming work, and yes I usually sell the majority of my coin as soon as I get it. In fact over 90% of my income has been in BTC for almost a full year now.. gotta pay those bills though!

I fail to see how jgarziks proposal is harmful to bitcoin. The only major criticism I have seen so far is concern over the voting procedure (or the fact that there is voting to begin with).

Yeah, people keep saying how "catosprophic" it would be but I don't really get it. If you are a miner, you might lose some money due to orphans if you are not paying attention and only upgrade after the fork. If you are a business using your own nodes to watch the blockchain and are also not paying attention, you might lose some money due to lost sales/opportunity (as your services would essentially be down until you get off your ass and upgrade).

"Gavhearn coin" makes you sound like a troll, also nice appeal to authority.. (*edit*: looking at your post history, looks like you use that a lot. try forming your own opinions for once?)
Yeah, no one is really agreeing with the 20MB thing, and also no one is really talking about that idea much anymore. What about all the other ideas, such as jgarziks proposal, or Meni Rosenfelds elastic block size? Would those also be "Gavhearn coin"? 
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:12:54
XT is a valid threat/option if no progress is made whatsoever. Fortunately that does not seem to be the case,  so I wouldn't be too worried about it unless the few people that actually think 1MB should never be changed (or not for several years) get their way. 
One last question if you don't mind: out of the proposals made so far, which do you think looks the most promising?
@_date: 2015-12-02 05:01:42
Which is why we didn't delete the threads and let it play out for the most part. The reason the Factom threads got locked was because if you look at the last couple pages, all they do is insult each other back and forth, repeating the same arguments,  dodging questions, and eventually Chris just flat out gave up and admitted he was now trolling. It wasn't going anywhere, so we closed it. I even told them that if they have anything new to bring to the table other than being dicks, I'd re-open it no problem. The offer is still open, and their ban isn't even permanent..

Average yes, but still happens frequently. 1 transaction blocks bring that average down quite a bit

According to blocks are not actually even close to being filled because he considers a large portion of all transactions currently being made to be purely "spam". This is why he has such a hard-on for keeping the 1MB limit, because he believes eventually all those "spam" transactions will be priced out of the market, which means he will have finally won his endless battle against the evil spammers like satoshi dice, counterparty, and any other service which he doesn't personally agree with. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:36:46
I like how nobody explains what exactly the advantage is of having 10,000 nodes versus say, 20,000 nodes. Everything keeps working the exact same,  nothing changes other than being "more decentralized".. which in this case just means it is theoretically more difficult to eliminate every server on the network, as if that was ever a real threat anyways. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:59:27
Yeah, pretty much. I understand that side of it, but the problem I have with it is as soon as you try and classify which transactions are "real transactions", things get ugly quick. IMHO, if a transaction is seen as valid in the protocol, is acceptable according to miner policies and pays a transaction fee, then it is a valid transaction, no matter what the "reason" behind the transaction was, or what the data inside of it means. Plain and simple. We all knew from the beginning that the blockchain will  keep on growing and growing forever, and we are only like 6 or 7 years into this... we should stop whining about growth and we should keep the blockchain neutral. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 15:55:52

No developers have done anything yet like you have described in your blog post, so why bother with the policy warning? If there was ACTUALLY a wallet or service out there which suddenly switched over to not being compatible at all with the current chain (note: no hard fork is even close to actually happening yet, at the very least it is a year down the road), then I would understand. But the way this was pushed out so suddenly, the wording of the post in general and all the usual suspects who also strongly pushed for this post to be so "urgent"... don't you think that seems a little fucked?

@_date: 2015-06-01 14:35:40
Everyone is not just going to magically start paying higher transaction fees immediately during peak network traffic, they are just going to get frustrated that their transactions are taking forever. Most people also want to minimize their fees, not maximize them.
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:09:56


Yeah, exactly. People are acting like 20MB is going to result in a massive increase in costs, but really it could take many years to reach the point where every block is completely filled 20X more than it is now, at which point 20MB could easily be as trivial as say, 500K is today.
It doesn't even have to be 20MB. It can be 10, or 8, or 5 or whatever else, we just need to agree to something bigger than 1 because we are already frequently finding blocks that are 75% the way there. Ideally it would be a modest initial increase, with smaller increases over time to keep up with moores law and natural network growth. Which is pretty much what is being proposed...
All we want is for bitcoin to continue running smoothly for the next several years while better scaling solutions are implemented. We need payment channels, we need sidechains, we need a larger block limit, and we need 100 other improvements as well, so let's get on with it then. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:36:42
How is it not? This whole debate is about the block size increase being the right step **in the short term**. You can't just wait around for the perfect solution to come around. And again, all the other scalability solutions being proposed also need a higher block limit eventually anyways. 
Also, from a practical standpoint, having more nodes does not actually do much of anything. Yes, having more means it is "more decentralized", and yes that is a good ideal... but what does that even mean other than an increased hypothetical cost/difficulty to simultaneously shut down every node in the network, which is already something that is nearly impossible? AFAIK there has been no actual decrease in performance or function of the network even though we have gone from something like 50,000 known full nodes to 10,000 . 
Making people pay increasingly higher fees per transaction and waiting increasingly longer times to have their transaction confirmed is the opposite of what we need for decentralization (and also the opposite of 2 of the main selling points that attract people to BTC). 
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:08:03
According to those release notes it says you can set it to store a minimum of the last 288 blocks, which is more around the range of 288 MB for 1MB blocks, and 5760 MB for 20MB blocks.. but that also assumes that every one of those 288 blocks is completely full, which would be pretty rare and especially with 20MB blocks (going to take probably several years to reach 20MB capacity). 
Also those numbers do not include the UTXO database and block index, which are separate storage concerns. All in all, will be a lot better than storing the full 30GB+ blockchain
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:56:14
the problem with those is how do you turn the quality of documentation into a number to use as a metric?
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:59:53
I kind of think that a lot of these guys don't actually regularly use bitcoin. As early adopters, they probably made a huge sack of money already and have just been sitting on it, thinking about how smart they are for the past couple years. Mean while, there is more and more people (me included) that use this stuff almost every single day, and unlike them we don't have a huge stash of old coins sitting around that make sure we can get highest priority and pay zero fees in each transaction etc.. and the whole view that the majority of blockchain transactions are "spam" and need to be pushed out of the network by an extreme transaction fee market is just stupid.
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:12:41
Lol I thought one of the main "advantages" of color coins was that the protocol is "finalized"?
@_date: 2015-06-01 14:59:38
Do you honestly believe that the primary consideration people have when choosing to run a node or not is the block size limit and how much ram and storage space they will use? You, greg and peter keep claiming this, but where is the evidence? You can't just point to the falling node count and say "derr it must be because of block limit and resource usage" without providing anything else to back that up. It totally couldn't have anything to do with the rise of mining pools, as well as off chain and SPV wallets and the fact that bitcoin-core was only used so much previously because it was literally the only wallet solution for a while. What the fuck kind of cave are you guys living in? 
News flash: the actual reason to run a node these days is weather they need the blockchain or not. Every bitcoin business out there that needs direct access to their own node, is going to keep running those same nodes, and are sure to expand them as their business expands (from more adoption, which means more transactions). Running a bitcoin node has ALWAYS been a big resource hog, and yeah that is a major reason why things like SPV wallets are so attractive... but there is no going back from that. You can't just decrease the limit or keep it static and pretend like that will be an incentive for more nodes to come online... how much money we can make with this tech is the only real incentive. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:50:35
You just sign a message and then give them the result to validate. No transaction required
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:55:40
There is zero proof beyond hypotheticals that increasing the block limit "decreases decentralization" by any measurable amount. That argument is getting really old.

they say we are decentralized, yet the same people control all the main information channels. hmm... 
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:25:24


In the network fork yes, but with the block size in general? Merchants and buyers are always going to want more transactions happening, and honestly probably most of them don't even care, so I don't see how they are a valid judge on choosing a block size limit (in the future as well, not just right now). 


nobody is saying right now, the earliest date is scheduled for at least a year from now. Even then, with BIP100 the limit would actually stay 1MB until the network collectively decides to increase it. *And even then*, blocks are not suddenly going to be filled just because there is a larger limit. 
Please, show some numbers on how the network cannot handle anything above the magic 1MB limit other than "look, the node count is falling!"
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:09:32
Another point that he doesn't mention is that *nobody* expected the 0.8.1 hardfork at all, it was due to a bug, not a planned thing.  The difference with the block size case is that WE KNOW there is going to be a problem eventually, weather that is next year or another year or 2 after. Ideally any hard fork should be planned 6 - 12 months in advance at the very least. Yes, we can get the majority to hard fork in a matter of hours during emergency, but it's not very smart if that emergency is something we could have avoided and knew about a year in advance. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:21:42

Probably not everyone, but enough to matter. Highly unlikely to happen though.

I don't see how slapping a blockchain on top gives any sort of advantage, probably the opposite actually.

@_date: 2015-06-16 14:05:27
The whole thing with there being 2 versions of bitcoin is mostly FUD. No fork is going to happen unless a majority (like 80% at least) of the network is already on board, and at that point anyone left behind will simply just upgrade their software and follow along with everyone else. Even if there was 20 or 30% of the network that decided to try and keep bitcoin split in to 2 chains, the remaining network would barely be able to keep up with the mining difficulty that was left over, making an even bigger incentive to ditch the old network and get with the program.
Also, no exchange is going to allow that situation to happen, it would be suicide. If one exchange accepts coins only from the old, smaller chain, while other exchanges stick to the larger chain.. that exchange is going to get absolutely raped by people dumping their coins on it in attempts to double their money. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:36:53

Well I'm of the opinion that when a thread turns into a flamewar and is then locked due to it not going anywhere, and then someone attempts to restart that same flamewar thread within a totally different topic (which was clearly about Factom, can you read post titles?), that's grounds for removing that post in order to keep the conversation on track.  We are pretty lax on moderation in general but IMHO that was justified. If you think that's dumb and censorship and how dare I make any decision about what is appropriate on a privately owned forum, well.. there is plenty of other bitcoin forums you can go do your witch hunt on, I hear bitcointalk.org is pretty good for that.

@_date: 2015-06-02 17:03:48
Yeah exactly. Sure, it is being developed.. but everyone expects anything that is announced to be done instantly or within just a few months, and then suddenly have everyone using it and global adoption or w/e.... in reality, it can take years for brand new stuff like this to be developed, and then more years for it to actually start to gain traction. Unfortunately we don't have several years before problems start occurring, hence why we want to increase the block limit to give everyone more breathing room while we develop better scaling solutions. 
It is kind of mind blowing that the developers behind lightning refuse to be given extra time to build their project, and instead want an emergency situation to happen in order to "incentivize the free market" to build solutions (yet their solution is the only one that could work, according to them)... did they not fucking raise $21 million or what? Sounds like an excellent incentive to me. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:23:20

Blocks are already frequently hitting the soft limit which is default for most miners, not that hard to imagine blocks with just another 300KB being created.

Good for them, unfortunately everyone sending transactions does not care. Even if they do really want to maximize their fees... the block reward far outweighs any tx fee income and will continue to do so until at least 2024 when the block reward is only around 3 BTC. Less than 1% of miner income comes from transaction fees right now, and the easiest way to maximize that is to allow for more transactions, not try and limit transactions in an attempt to force a more extreme fee market (which will only result in far less transactions, thus less total fees).

I won't speak directly for Adam (although 99% sure he has no factoids at all, and we havn't even talked to Factom at all before this, although other podcasters on the network have interviewed them). I'm the one that provoked all of this though, sort of. It started off with OP throwing a few dumb accusations at LTB, and in one of my responses I teased about their Factom "investigation" which they had posted about way aback in August, but then suddenly stopped even though they seemed so sure of themselves. I didn't expect it to blow up like it did, honestly kind of regret saying anything. For the record I have never invested in factom or been paid by them or w/e, I don't even find the project terribly interesting and don't know much about it, I was just poking Chris to be a dick.

Wow, really? Why does that matter, they are still transactions, no? So am I right in saying that blocks ARE hitting the soft limit frequently, or am I not? 
So let me get this straight. You think that we are no where near the point of reaching the block limit, because according to you, a significant percentage of transactions are all "spam", and it is totally OK with you if we keep hitting the limit because eventually TX fees will rise and hopefully price out all those "spam" transactions? Is it fair to say that your primary motivation for keeping the block limit at 1 MB is to see all those transactions that you do not agree with finally die off?

Yep exactly. It is retarded to think that keeping the block size so limited or even lowering it would cause an increase in the node count. It has always been about convenience, and it always will be. Businesses are the only one with incentives to run full nodes, and somehow I seriously doubt they will suddenly have to shut down because *too many* transactions are happening on the bitcoin network. If anything they would shut down because there isn't enough transactions and they cannot scale their business.

How is it really "easier to use" or "easier to implement"? With counterparty all you do it run the daemon on a server and then make some basic API calls for whatever you need to do. It's really quite easy. Being "simpler" does not make it better or more powerful. 
Futhermore, you can now create new tokens for free (minus BTC miners fee), which IMO pretty much defeats one of the main pros about colored coins (being able to create tokens without needing an alt like MSC or XCP)

yeah, thats the ironic thing. Makes a hugely hyped film about bitcoin. Prices it in dollars, makes the option to pay bitcoin pretty obscure, and then forces you to wait 6 confirmations just to get the $15 movie. Pretty much defeats any convenience bitcoin introduces, would have been faster and easier to just pay credit card (or wait till the torrent 20 minutes later... lol)
It should have been just click a button to purchase -&gt; scan QR code -&gt; give you the damn movie as soon as payment is seen, shouldnt take longer than 30 seconds. Its not like someone is going to try and 0-conf double spend you for a digital movie copy....
seems like a major noob.

mpex is nothing like NYSE at all (hilarious you would compare the two). Almost the entire trade volume on it is just shares in.. mpex itself.  99.99999772% of the last 24/h trading volume is shares in itself. 99.999743466% for the past monthly trade volume. "B-b-but 12,000 BTC volume in the past 30 days, thats like 6 million $ man..!!!" &lt;- yeah except I guarantee almost all of that is just a small handful of early adopters / early miners who had their hands on a ton of coins from back in the day and then suddenly became rich when the value went up 500 fold. Its not like there are tons of  investors pouring money into MPEX trading itself on MPEX.
Satoshi dice isnt even on there anymore and has become pretty irrelevant for at least a year now. What else has been on there that is noteworthy? BitBet is about the closest thing and I see that its still listed, although not doing much. Also almost every single asset listed on there is owned and created by the same guy (the owner of mpex). Everybody stopped caring about mpex once satoshi dice was done with....

unfortunately there is no real way (yet anyways) to decentralize the physical realm, always has to be somebody holding the gold or bag of rice or whatever in order for you to trade in the token you are trading for the actual item. 
With these sytems like counterparty, you could be anyone, anywhere in the world (no matter your social status, nationality etc. ) and own some futures in the gold market. or own dividend paying stocks from companies, or own a diverse portfolio of assets and building wealth, etc. No permission required, no restrictions, no barriers to entry other than internet access, learning curve and aquiring some bitcoin (probably the hardest part)

Im in that same age demographic, and I think alot of people simply just have a really hard time picturing things being possibly any different than what they are right now. Its sad really, especially when you see this from the tech oriented crowd (typically IT people that arnt programmers or engineers, I find anyway)
New kind of money not controlled by anybody? Lol obvious scam only the government/banks can ever possibly create currency. 
I can already buy whatever I want online with credit cards, why would I use bitcoins? so pointless
So I cant already pay for my groceries, utilities, gas, rent and everything else in bitcoin? wow thats stupid
Ok sure its a cool idea, but government will obviously never allow it because they are all our powerful leaders that no one can stand in the way of....
IMO the gov really isnt as powerful as people make it out to be. The leaders (i.e, the politicians) generally dont know jack shit about technology and are all kinds of ignorant, and are constantly just trying to "win votes" and be politically correct. Most (or at least many) government employees also dont really give a shit about improving things and get to enjoy some nice cozy job security. On top of that, the whole system/institution as a whole is slow as hell thanks to lack of or mis-communication between departments and the stacks upon stacks of complicated (or at least complex sounding) legal policies. Government is basically just a giant retarded sloth when it comes to most things. A giant retarded sloth with guns and alot of money.
We just need to stop being stuck in the old way of doing things. The way forward shouldnt be to just create more stacks of paper written in legaleze to define more "rules"to the game, which few people care about and fewer actually understand.. The answer is to create technological and educational solutions to these problems. Thanks to the internet and other technologies such as the blockchain, we have the capabilities to do this, so lets fucking use it.

If they are taking away some stupid thing you are screwing around with and distracting/annoying people with, or like take your weed or a weapon away from you or something, sure, thats fine.

Ok, hypothetical question: what if the majority of the network (including all the major exchanges etc.) goes along with the change to increase the limit. What will you do? Will you cave and go along with it, attempt to maintain the 1MB chain and build support for it, or  just quit bitcoin altogether? 
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:56:42
exactly. When they print new money, the general population doesn't receive shit, it all just goes straight to the government (who often wastes it on all kinds of BS), and  to the banks (which pay their CEOs ridiculous bonuses), which then loan it out to big corporations etc. Thats my understanding of it at least.
@_date: 2014-11-24 16:38:34
Exactly. What people don't seem to get is that if you make it so your average computer can realistically mine and make profit, then that means botnets would quickly dominate the network (and also give even more incentive for the creation of malware). This was already the case not too long ago. 
And yeah, ASIC resistance is just a whack-a-mole game. Anything you switch to its only a matter of time before someone figures out an algorithm or designs custom hardware to give a huge advantage over standard computers. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:16:53
1. Couldnt tell you about books... I think with bitcoin pretty much all your resources are going to be online. The white paper and the official bitcoin wiki are good places to start. the first step is really gaining a understanding of the technology and its implications and possibilities
2. The programming language isnt really relevant. Take your pick, perl, rails, python, PHP, JS (node etc.) etc... really just comes down to preference and what you are most skilled in. You can take any of the major programming languages used on the web and build pretty much any application if you are skilled anough
3. Dont day trade whatsoever unless you have the knowledge, experience and capital to do so. Most people that try and get into day trading end up getting burned. Pretty much everything else though, I would say yes/maybe. If you can get a gig going that is making you more money than you would just working a regular full time job... then hell yeah

They reached &gt; 50% and nothing happened at all other than the bitcoin community shitting itself (which was predictable, they would have to be insane to suddenly destroy their own business by attempting to attack the network). The price did not tank because of that... price didnt start dropping rapidly until februrary. Did you forget already that that is the same time that Mt.Gox stopped all fiat AND BTC withdrawals, everyone flipping their shit about them being insolvent, and then half a billion $ worth of bitcoin going "missing" thanks to our good friend Karpeles? We got Goxed, not Ghash'd
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:54:22
Indeed. Not sure why your getting all the downvotes.
 Yes, it sucks pretty bad that all these people lost their money. But that doesnt mean the market isnt working.... the market works when things happen. Mtgox fucked up big time and has utterly failed. Some people lost money, everybody is pissed. Now most people (hopefully) will have higher standards for exchanges and other BTC services, requiring more transparency, proof of funds/solvency, per-user private keys etc. Some bad shit happened, but now we will have higher levels of quality and accountability amongst the rest of the bitcoin space.

There are not many counterparty compatible wallets out there at the moment, but I believe several including a mobile one are being developed. 
As for creating a local currency.. yes this is possible via creating a user-created asset. The bitcoin address that "owns" that asset/token is effectively the central issuer for it, allowing you to do things like pay dividends or create new units, or lock-in the existing supply.  You could then set up a company which takes peoples fiat dollars or pounds or whatever, and then sends them the equivalent of your new token at a 1:1 ratio.  It does introduce some trust in the system (people have to trust that you will actually give them tokens, or exchange back for fiat) but for a token used by an individual group or community, that is an easy problem. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 08:55:18
Im surprised there hasnt been much mention of it in this thread actually. It would work perfectly fine for the job, far better than colored coins (which almost no one actually uses, although a cool project), and "sidechains" which everyone constantly talks about and acts like its the solution, but there is not even a single sidechain implementation in existence (AFAIK)... Counterparty does everything colored coins does + 10X more and far more flexible, can use any bitcoin address (not just some made up brand new address format which no one supports) and no risk of accidently deleting your assets by sending a payment using the wrong wallet
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:35:39

From the sounds of it, looks like he actually did know that the guy he was selling to was involved with the silk road, and then continued to facilitate it anyways, which breaks some vague law. It's their rules, he broke them and they caught him and theres nothing he can do about it, so it makes sense that he would pucker up and take the shorter time instead of the far longer one.

Neither you or I have absolutely any idea about any A/B tests they may or may not have done, or any of the actual numbers behind it, so you don't "know better than wikipedia" any more than I do. 
Maybe adding in a bitcoin button would offset any negative impact from simply "having more options on the screen", and bring in more money in the long term? Or maybe it wouldnt and it actually would result in less donations overall. Or maybe roughly the same amount of donations would be recieved and it wouldnt have any effect at all... You have no clue.

Probably because you have people going around pushing and pushing it on business owners who dont already understand or care about bitcoin.

biggest misconception is that you have to wait for confirmations for everything, including buying coffee, slice of pizza or whatever... 
transactions show up near instantly. If I send you 1 BTC right now, your wallet will show it a few seconds later. 99.9% of the time, you can be sure that its going to confirm eventually, so you can assume that the transaction is a done deal. 
The only exception is if somebody tries to do a "0 confirmation double spend", which is actually really hard to pull off and even harder (and ballsier) in a face to face transaction. Unless your a website that accepts 0 confirmation transactions and lets people withdraw before funds are confirmed (or ship out product before a confirmation), then realistically you dont need to worry about it at all. 
When a transaction is confirmed, its basically the same thing as when credit card transactions are "cleared". For comparison, credit card transactions take 30 - 60 days or even more to "clear" for the merchant (become permanent and no risk of getting charged back). Now imagine if a restaurant made you wait 2 months before you could eat that slice of pizza, just to make sure you didnt try and screw them over... 
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:01:30
This wouldnt really work for websites, all you would have to do is point your domain to a new server and you can get around whatever they have setup. Even if they hijack your domain somehow, ICANN could probably step in no problem if they needed to
This is already happening for individual desktop users though. I forget what the name of it is, but basically its a virus that encrypts your entire harddrive and wont decrypt it unless you send them some bitcoins.
It definitely brings the hacking and cybercrime scene to a whole new  level (especially when attacking sites that hold funds in a server hot wallet, like an exchange or something). Pretty interesting IMO

I honestly dont think that the chance of having your computer directly hacked/compromised is any greater while having bitcoins than it is without.

QR codes are actually extremely useful when it comes to bitcoin. Scan code with phone, type in amount, hit send. Not sure if it can get simpler than that?

you can accept with zero confirmations for most PoS purchases no problem. I think a good comparison is accepting credit cards, but the money isnt actually cleared until like 30 or 60 days or something. 
The equivalent in bitcoin is waiting for confirmations, which take on average 10 minutes instead of an entire month or 2... occasionally though there are hiccups like this where a transaction takes over an hour or sometimes many hours to confirm. There are alot of variables at play, but the amount of people who would know how to attempt double spends and attempt them in person is very very small, and its never a garunteed success. 
IMO Bitpay shouldnt consider the transaction invalid if its been over an hour, they should continue to monitor until it just never confirms and is dropped from the memory pool. I remember one time a few months ago I sent something around 0.01 BTC somewhere and strangely it took like 3 days to confirm. But it did eventually go through

@_date: 2014-10-23 16:49:33
so... the entire premise of OP's argument is that they will create a side chain that is way better than vanilla BTC, thus the majority of all BTC is somehow extremely likely to  move to it, and because this guy has a ton of money and this group would effectively control that side-blockchain, then therefore Blockstream now has a monopoly over the entire bitcoin ecosystem? Sounds like a total BS claim and based on nothing but assumptions.

You would think that, but that is not necessarily always true actually
* Single page javascript apps typically have a lot of animations and/or special effects, which can impact performance. It can also be pretty slow at rendering a lot of content at once (going to your account history, which might hold hundreds of items, or a few dozen new posts showing up or something). This is particularly noticeable on older and lower end computers. 
* API calls. With something very dynamic such as a forum, you are probably easily going to be making a few dozen API calls or more a minute (grabbing new posts, messages, notifications, account profiles, who is online etc. etc.), and each one of those has its own latency of course.  Times that by how many minutes each user is online (i.e, hasnt actually manually closed the page) and also how many tabs or windows each person has open (I can easily have 15 - 20 tabs open of different posts from reddit and different forums). This easily adds up to way way more  requests hitting your server than would have otherwise (although the processing side is somewhat improved, but not   by that much)
also some other issues not exactly performance related:
* With server-side processing and rendering etc, you don't have to worry really about browser compatibility, except with just your HTML, CSS and basic javascript functions, which is all pretty basic stuff. Having your app almost completely in JS opens pretty much everything up to possible browser compatibility issues, which are basically the bane of any web developers existence... half the time this seems to result in the devs just saying "fuck it" and stating that the app is only compatible in chrome and/or firefox lol
* Because of the possibility of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, you pretty much have to use an SSL certificate with the app. In general that's a good thing to have anyways, but it is an extra step and cost to consider..
* Due to everything being done client side, search engines and web crawlers cannot read and index the website. Definitely not what you want if you are running a blog or a forum. There is ways around this, but AFAIK it basically consists of running a program that renders the javascript, takes snapshots of the end result and then gives this to google and friends as a static version of the site.
IMO single page client side web apps are not well suited for content rich websites like blogs and forums. Better for chat rooms or apps that do stuff (accounting, scheduling/project management, image editing, btc wallets etc.)

I believe that this will pretty much be the make or break point for Bitcoin. If we can prove that the network and ecosystem can survive a second drop in the block reward (especially since at that point mining and everything else will likely be at an even way bigger scale), then it will show that the system really is working and can survive over the long term. We won't know immediately, but over the 4 or 5 months after the halving, we will either see the mining network collapse and die, or we will see it readjust itself and continue chugging along.
2017 (post-halving) is going to be one hell of a year

what do you need the law for? if someone buys something with bitcoin on your e-commerce store and wants to return it, just give them store credit (easiest). or give them back the $ value in bitcoin, or just the full btc amount that they spent with you. its entirely up to you, but its not that hard
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:48:44
No, your just getting defensive now. 
What hes trying to say is that you cant just go around asking for investment if all you have is an idea on paper, you need at least some sort of prototype or MVP (minimum viable product). You know how in school they tell you that you can just make an idea and a business plan, present it to a bank or investors and people will give you money? Doesnt actually work like that (unless you have some serious reputation and experience, or the right connections).
Hes right, faucets just arnt a very good investment and dont make much money. Most of them die off very quickly and the main ones that have survived get tons of traffic and survive pretty much solely off of ad revenue and affiliate links. Looking through your document, im not seeing much of any ways to generate income, just lots of ways to give away money. So you want people to pay you a fee in order for them to pay more money to other people who are almost for sure going to turn around and sell it, spend it somewhere else or hoard it? Why would any business want to do that?
You also have to keep in mind that geotagging can be easily spoofed.. all somebody has to do is create a program that sends out requests with fake co ordinates and they could find all the hidden areas and take all the faucet money for themselves with no one actually physically showing up to the location (trying to restrict payments by IP address or user account wont work either). 
Again, you need some sort of actual proof of concept built before you will ever have any chance at all for funding for something like this. If you dont know how to program, you will need to put up your own money to get somebody who can.

I dont think you understand what the word "literally" means. Considering the fact that the past half a year my income has been almost entirely in bitcoin and its been enough to easily sustain  my lifestyle including paying rent, bills, groceries etc... more so then when I worked a regular full time job.  I think its pretty safe to say that YES, people do use bitcoin. Get over it.

The invention of a secure, distributed public ledger (the blockchain) enables the possibility to make more or less obsolete almost all facets of the global financial industry and more. Banks, brokers, escrow, remittance, payment processors and credit card companies, property/ownership deeds, lending, stocks, contracts, even voting. Were talking about essentially replacing the biggest, most profitable and most powerful institutions on earth with a completely transparent, open source and global set of technologies, and in many cases using this technology to completely remove labour from the equation. Think when much of the agriculture work force was replaced by largely automated systems and heavy machinery a lifetime ago... except this time its going to be the banksters etc.

AFAIK counterparty never created and sold a whole bunch of XCP for themselves as a way to fund raise. There was a "burning" period where people just sent BTC to a provably undependable address which created the units of XCP. The developers would have to have spent their own BTC in order to get any
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:59:14
The funny thing is, its actually so fucking easy to keep and store BTC. Do you know how to download a program, hit next a few times and write on a piece of paper?
Steps to create a reasonably secure wallet:
* download electrum from electrum.org
* double click file, hit next a few times just like any other program
* write down somewhere safe the 12 random words it very very clearly tells you to write down ( your wallet backup )
* Acquire BTC ( the hard part )
Congratulations, easy as that. No more having to worry about exchange or other service shutting down or taking off with your coin.
Can someone explain how exactly that process is insecure or overly complicated? Probably not the best setup if you own tens of thousands or millions worth of BTC, but if your like most people then you probably only dream of even having that kind of money anyways. Short of a keylogger installed to capture your password, I don't see any way someone could get to your BTC. But in that case you are fucked anyways, including your bank, credit and personal info.
Also if you are the kind of person who uses windows + internet explorer and thinks that deleting a shortcut off the desktop is the same as uninstalling a program.. Bitcoin isn't for you.

I wonder if it has to do with a lot of the people in mt.gox being out of the game. A lot of them who invested and stored so much were clearly there for pure speculation/investment rather than actually caring about the technology and actually using it. They were probably the worst offenders for panic selling over the slightest bad news or panic buying over any good news. thats all they cared about.

If you assume that 100% the central authority can be trusted forever, then there is no point in the blockchain to begin with, you would just trust whatever the 3rd party says and they could run and control systems however they want. Similar to what we try and do now (e.g, we put all our trust in the banks and gov, and assume they will be around forever). The problem is that 99% of the time central authorities cannot be truly trusted, and we get shown this over and over and over again. Human nature makes central systems inherently flawed and easy to corrupt. 
You cannot guarantee at all any of the traits you mention with a central 3rd party (irreversible, anonymous, limited supply, low fees, fast, high security). What's to stop whoever is at the top of CentralCoin Corp. from deciding to change the rules willy nilly? Or they dont like a certain company so they just block all transactions to them. etc. etc.
Centralization is the easy way out, decentralization is the real way out. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:29:19
Yeah, its kind of interesting / amusing actually to watch how they have done a complete 180 on everything over the past month.
Up until now they have been constantly pushing the idea of Decentralized Autonomous Companies ("DAC"s), with each company having its own blockchain and everything being semi independent of eachother. And a lot of heavy usage of words like "company", "share", "dividends", "interest" etc. in all of their marketing, with the pitch "bitshares does for business what bitcoin does for money"
Fast forward to today, and now all of a sudden they have come to two realizations. 1) decentralization is hard and having a bunch of different blockchains for different things isnt actually that efficient, and 2) they might actually get in trouble from the fed for throwing around investment terminology and taking peoples money, especially since the team is US based. They have abandoned official support for separate DACs and merged most of the existing DAC projects into one centralized "SuperDAC". They have also decided to rebrand themselves as a "community" not a company, stop using any investment-like words in marketing and even drop the whole DAC term. Check out [this thread]( for example, where Dan admits that the entire change from "company" to "community" is an attempt to avoid the SEC. 
Seems like they change their mind on something every other day and it is confusing the hell out of people. What's worse is the users and investors that have spoke out about the confusion and constant changes just get shot down and basically made fun of, and then no real explanation given. Such a trainwreck

99% of those bitcoin alternatives are just bitcoin with a different name and slightly tweaked variables...  And actually yes, it is true scarcity. Sure, I could make 10,000 different variations of cryptocurrency and there could be an infinite amount of possible digital currency units (there already is), but none of those can ever give me *more* bitcoin. There is only 21 million bitcoin and that's all there ever will be. If you go and make 10 trillion units of KurdCoin, that does not mean that there is 10 trillion more BTC as well?... same technology, different networks. 
Bitcoin is not perfect, but I do believe that cryptocurrency in general is going to change things in a big way. Weather it will or not is a matter of opinion, nobody can tell the future. 
Also, please explain these disadvantages and vulnerabilities which have not been already talked to death about, are not completely hypothetical or are not obvious temporary problems (a.k.a business opportunities)
@_date: 2014-10-13 18:53:08
thats not actually true with counterparty. If I receive some counterparty tokens, I could spend the entire BTC balance on that address, and I would not lose any tokens (it doesnt rely on the actual inputs/ouputs to determine who has what). Now, I cant spend those tokens until I mix in some BTC on that address, but there is no way to accidentally lose anything unless you lose your private keys (which you would be screwed anyways)
@_date: 2014-08-22 14:57:49

You wouldnt need to buy or sell LTC anymore. There would be no need for crypto exchange markets. Your 1 LTC could be converted to 1 BTC at any time, or vice versa.

Probably possible yeah, but why? To try and slightly boost the amount of BTC transaction fees (which are only going to be a small piece of the mining pie for a very long time)?

@_date: 2014-02-24 17:32:16
Sorry to say, but you havnt "designed a technology" if all you have is ideas and maybe a bunch of stuff on paper. Sure, the idea might work totally awesome, but it doesnt mean anything until there is actually some sort of a working prototype.
No one is going to just "buy your idea". What would they do with it?If you want to get bought out, you need something that actually exists. Im assuming you dont have any knowledge really of programming or creating hardware, which means in order to bring your idea to life you will need to hire at least a few people to build it and make it work. 
I can tell you right now that no highly skilled and self respecting developer/engineer will take on a project for free or a "promise" of share in profits later. 99% of these kinds of requests end up being total duds (people thinking they have the next great idea and want you to work for free in exchange for future shares. never actually works out). So if you actually want to create this, be prepared for a significant financial investment. You can probably find some kids that will join in for free "to build their portfolio" or something like that, but they just arnt going to have the necessary skills to develop a quality, secure, reliable and scalable financial application 
Also, you cant really patent it and sell it while at the same time making it open source... either open source (i.e, free) or not. Furthermore, just because bitcoin itself is open source doesnt mean that every application built around it must also be open source.

Actually, you can read and detect a pending unconfirmed counterparty transaction just fine, CounterWallet does this and you can see pending transactions on blockscan.com. Although AFAIK that is not part of the core CounterpartyD API commands/results (yet).

If you have 1 bitcoin in an address and hold it there for 1 full day, and then move it somewhere else, that counts as 1 "bitcoin day destroyed". If you held that 1 bitcoin for 100 days, it would count as 100 days destroyed. 10 BTC moving after being held for 1 day = 10 days destroyed, etc..
basically its just a way to measure whats going on in the network. Large amount of days destroyed means old coins (previously in someones savings or storage or whatever) are on the move

not sure why your getting so many downvotes.. 
having 50% does not mean you can rewrite the blockchain.. its  not like as soon as that "magic 50%" hits all of a sudden nothing works
and also ghash.io makes absurd amounts of money a day. why the hell would they try and destroy the network just for the hell of it? The whole point is that there is more economic incentive to play nice rather than to screw around with things

Lol. For one this drop is nothing. For another, nobody knows and nobody has ever truly known the exact reasons for price fluctuations, its all just trying to guess how the hivemind is behaving, and being wrong about it most of the time.

@_date: 2014-04-13 15:56:01
I dont see why you couldnt.. See my Counterparty implementation example. You could have BTC itself be the pegged sidechain token ( BTC - BTC transfer), Then the system would work just like it does currently. XCP secondary token for issuing assets, assets themselves riding on small amounts of the side-chain BTC (a bit similar to colored coins), and then you could trade the side-chain BTC for the asset tokens, or transfer back into main-net if you want. The main difference would be that they would not be limited to 40 bytes of data to store in a transaction, and confirmations could happen a lot faster, making it way more smooth to buy and sell assets in the decentralized exchange, or perform other counterparty actions.  Data limit and block times are the major bottlenecks right now.

this next one is going to be REALLY interesting. Mining operations are already at a massive scale compared to what they were during the last halving, and we didnt even have ASICs available then!

no, people have very specifically been complaining about the time it takes waiting for confirmations. I have had it happen to me one time though where sending money from one phone to another took like 10 plus minutes just for the tx to be broadcasted, but I blame the shitty generic bitcoin android app for that. Every other in person or device to device transaction I have done has shown up within a couple seconds tops. I see your point though

While the subscription model (and relying on people forgetting about it etc..) Has been true for porn so far... Think about all the people that can't get credit cards (teenagers especially, or anyone in numerous other countries). Also, I am quite positive that a huge amount of people would be willing to pay for premeum content if they didn't have their name attached (emberassment) and no risk of identity theft and extra charges. Also micro payments
@_date: 2014-07-27 15:52:25
your never going to get any hash rate that is going to make you anything with just random peoples spare CPU power. those days are long gone, just a couple ASICs would do more even if you had a few thousand regular visitors (unlikely, they wouldnt even make anything, just burning energy, no actual incentive). Also you have to keep in mind that the difficulty is just going to keep going up and up (you would have to maintain an insane amount of user growth) and in about a year and a half the block reward will be halved down to 12.5 bitcoins, so there will be even less earnings.
I wouldnt say that mining is worthless at the moment.. there is a reason why there are giant mining operations in existence. it can be very profitable if you do it right. basically you need a lot of money to invest up front though, difficulty is too high to start small.
As for your website... honestly its a very awkward and hard to read design and with no content to tell me even what it really is or why I would want to join. You also cant tell me that its private and secure.. and then require me to fill out a big form with first and last name, birthday, country and gender... lol what? I would also be interested in knowing how you actually store information (do you even hash the passwords..?)
Actually, I signed up, and when I go to my profile, it has my password auto filled... therefore you must be storing passwords in plain text. thats pretty bad man. **anyone reading this, do not use a password you may have used somewhere else on this site**
Sorry for the harsh criticism, but this honestly looks like something somebody made after doing their first couple PHP tutorials and with no prior programming or development experience. You really expect this to be something used for privacy and immune to government spying?
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:01:42
I dont get why people even think that PoS in bitcoin is even remotely a good idea... So, instead of whoever puts the most time and energy (a.k.a *work*) into the system getting newly generated coins... we should just have it so whoever has the most money already gets the new coins? How is that fair? In a way I guess it is a similar thing (need a lot of money to mine, need a a lot of money to stake), but I think the additional barriers to entry with mining are an important difference. With mining, you have to have quite a bit of technical knowledge, actually get hardware, get a facility/warehouse, pay for electricity etc.. it takes a lot of time and dedication. With staking, you can just be some rich asshole with a few million $ and a single server and start raking in the coins. Staking skips most of the economy side of mining (hardware purchases, electricity etc. ), which IMO is kind of where bitcoin gets part of its base value - miners need to sell to recoup their operational costs, while PoS coins dont have that incentive.
Also PoS has not been tested at scale at all.. I would bet that all of them have only a few hundred, *maybe* 1000 actual users at the most. We don't really know if it will even work or how easily it will be able to be attacked or corrupted. Compared to Proof of Work which we know has been working well for the last 5+ years and has survived every attack thrown at it.

Yeah, im not worried at all. It will resolve itself, plus ghash would have to be seriously retarded to try and double spend their coins using their hashpower. They make ridiculous amounts per day, why would they risk screwing with that? Does anyone honestly think that they are sitting back and being like "excellent, we have gained 50%+ hash power (fyi, they didnt, blockchain.info is only estimates), time to start fucking shit up"? Sure, I get that the point is that there is still the possibility, and we should try as hard as possible to decentralize hash power, but this experiment is far from over. Some people are acting like as soon as that number reaches that threshold, price is going to instantly drop and its going to be game over... lol, right.

I dont see any technical reason that merged mining would actually be required. Mining has nothing to do with the actual transfering/pegging mechanism, it would essentially just be a new transaction type (or new script codes). From what I understand, merged mining is just a suggested way to bootstrap off of the power of the bitcoin network. You could have scrypt just as easily, but it would likely be more difficult to get a secure amount of hashing power behind it

Well what are you considering exactly to be "the majority of it's price growth"? $0 to $10 = infinity % growth? It all depends on what date range you are looking at.. 5th grade stuff man. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 07:45:54
do you have any example of how exactly its so easy? From my understanding, you basically have to propagate 2 transactions. one to the target, and then one to somewhere you control. The trick is to propagate the target transaction so that your target sees it show up on their wallet, but at the same time propagate the other one even faster across the network, so that most nodes see it first and then drop the targets transaction (nodes will reject transactions with outputs that they have already seen as being spent, right?), and then hope that the transaction going back to you is the one miners pick up for the next block. am I wrong or missing something? It doesnt seem like every attempt is going to be successful, so theres a good chance that you end up just actually paying for the item and the scam failing.

is that a bad thing? I find it hard to believe that the absolute massive amount of consumerism and materialism particularly in the western world is actually good for us and doing anything other than creating absurd amounts of waste and funnelling more and more money to the top of the pyramid. 
Also, there is no way you can  accurately predict the price. You can make a pretty good prediction that it will gain value in the long term, but in the short term it could really be anywhere, and I dont foresee that changing at all. Maybe if BTC stabilizes, but in that case the increase in value would be much more gradual and nothing like saving your money for a few days and suddenly being able to buy 4x as much.

there are a few sites out there that do it. It is possible to get a loan and be totally legit, and it is possible to make money investing in loans, but you have to be extremely careful not to get scammed.
Just look at the stats here: 
19,611 BTC loaned out, only 2,199 loans actually paid back and there is over 1000 active loans currently. Mind you most of that BTC was when the price was far lower (the sites been around for a while now). Seeing as how there is only twice the current active loans that have ever been paid back, and that much BTC has been lent out... the place is a hive for scammers.
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:13:03
yep. Not to mention many of the very large wallets are shared web wallets and exchanges.

I sort of agree. It was basically just summarizing the main happenings and events in the community over the past few years, stuff a lot of us are already pretty familiar with.  I guess not sure what else I was expecting really, but they didnt really go to into the actual implications of BTC and all the stuff you can do, just lots of "this is the most amazing technology in the world" hype with not a whole lot of explanation of WHY. Still though, it was interesting to see the real world interviews and office spaces and stuff of some of these guys during the height of their operations (tradehill, bitinstant, even mtgox).

@_date: 2014-06-13 14:43:31
First off, no. They cannot change the protocol whatsoever. The only thing that a 51% *attack* (they have to purposely be maliciously attacking the network) can do is allow them to "double spend" their own coins (not anyone elses). Basically, they could spend some bitcoins, wait for a few confirmations and get their product or service or whatever, and then switch over to an alternate version of the blockchain where those transactions never happened or just went back to themselves. They can do this blockchain switch at a very high success rate because they have majority of hash rate, but can only effect their own coins. Other than that, they could choose to not mine anyones transactions, making confirmations for everyone take way longer.
So to sum up, they can attempt to scam people with their own coins (which would be quickly discovered), or they can delay confirmations on everyones transactions, which would also be obvious right away.
You cant really split them in half because part of the main problem is that they actually own most of their hashing power directly, rather than people just pointing their machines to their pool network. They buy and run their own ASICs and then sell their hash power directly over their website in the form of "shares" or "mining contracts".

@_date: 2014-04-19 19:37:37
OP actually has somewhat of a point, although its not completely true, since banks do a ton of other services  that bitcoin obviously does not (mainly requiring human interactions).
I dont know about your area, but in canada, if your employer isnt set up for direct deposit, then you are forced to use cheques. Which means you need to go to a teller during bank hours, which generally totally conflict with the average persons schedule (9 - 5).  Sure, you can go to the ATM area at your bank which is open 24/7 and deposit it, but if you deposit it into the machine they put a hold on all that money for a minimum of 3 to 5 business days, with only access to like $100 right away. Not a big deal if you have money already or no bills coming up, but if you are completely broke and need food or have to pay rent the next day or something, ATM deposit is not really an option. Also, even if they are actually open and running on saturdays and/or sundays, those days are still not considered "business days", which is total BS  IMO.  Believe it or not, many many people still use cash and cheques for a lot of things (cheques mostly from employment or for rent). There are also hard limits on how much cash per day you can withdraw from an ATM.
All in all, its not *really* that bad, first world problems and such.. but I think the whole concept of "business days" is obsolete and just stupid in this day and age. Its all mostly automated anyways, and often staff working around the clock/every day also anyways, so why the hell implement artificial delays?

Not that stupid actually. Its pretty obvious that you can implement anything in a Turing complete language... but OPs question was if bitcoin could adapt/assimilate ethereum eventually, and the answer to that is it pretty much already has (well, the contracts system at least). No, counterparty is not necessary for it at all, other protocols and systems could be built...  but they were the ones to port it over, hence my comment.

Man, I sure wish somebody would pay me a million bucks to make some forum software.... forums are actually one of the more basic web applications you can make. Its not that hard, just can be kind of time consuming. Hell, I made a full on content management system, blogging platform and forum software over the span of a few months earlier this year by myself from scratch. Definitely not as full featured and polished as say wordpress or SMF, PHPbb etc.. but it works well and I know that if I spent all that time and time up til now working on just the forum aspect, I could definitely have something that features most everything of what other popular forum software.  &gt;_&lt;

you could download the server side version of it and keep a copy of it. I believe electrum servers run based off of bitcoin-qt, so you would still need to wait a while for it to sync up in that case. But if the whole project goes under and all servers go offline, you could still use that to run your own server and use the electrum wallet as normal. Or you can just export a copy of your private key and stash that somewhere, on paper or something and use whatever wallet programs are available.

When trying to solve a new block, miners listen on the network for any new transactions occuring. If the transaction looks legit and is paying a high enough fee, the miner includes the transaction in their current block they are working on (its possible to simply not include any transactions if they want though).  When they finally solve the block, all transactions that they included now gain a confirmation and are permanently recorded on the blockchain. The 25 new bitcoins that are created from this process are awarded to the miner, along with all of the transaction fees collected from the network transactions they just confirmed. 
So basically, besides the block reward, there is an incentive to mine in order to collect transaction fees. Right now,the block reward far outweighs how much fees are collected, but there is also no mining advantage in just ignoring all transactions and only getting the block reward. Mise well include as many transactions as possible to get the little bit extra BTC.
Eventually when the block reward becomes super tiny or just dissapears (many many years from now), transaction fees will be the primary miner income.

It has advantages and trade offs. With counterparty, each token/asset name must be unique on the network, is restricted to only capitalized and alphabetical characters (no numbers or underscores or anything). But it has some neat and pretty powerful features such as a built in decentralized exchange, ability to broadcast data feeds, decentralized/trustless betting and more. Also because it actually has its own ledger, you cannot accidentally lose or destroy any tokens in an address just from using the wrong wallet. 
In colored coins, you can create tokens for cheaper (not really a huge difference between XCP and CC price wise though, compared to for e.g bitshares). Token naming is much less restrictive and does not need to be unique (IIRC you rely on an ID # instead). However it is much more bare-bones in features and you can accidentally lose or "uncolor" your coins if you are not using a compatible wallet.

Have you ever been scammed before or money stolen from your bank account? Alot of the time the banks dont even do anything for you, or at least make it very hard. Iv easily spent several hours on the phone going from department to department and automated message machines etc. dealing with bank bullshit which has cost me a fair sum of money. It can be an incredibly frustrating experience especially when you have to explain the situation over and over again. If your persistent enough you can usually get some sort of resolution, but its not as easy as "oh hey bank that wasnt me spending that please reverse immediately kthx'

perfect example of how much a pain in the ass chargebacks are.
People go on about how its such a good thing that you can just call up your credit card company or bank and get transactions reversed. Its really not that simple at all. You can easily spend hours on the phone getting essentially nothing accomplished, and depending on the situation you might not even get your  money back at all. This goes both ways, for merchants dealing with chargebacks (which can be a complete killer for small businesses, especially when trying to get into the e-commerce world) and for people who have either gotten their card number stolen (extremely easy and common) or have fallen for scams or other money making schemes (oh, you want to reverse those 5 seperate charges for $100 you never knew would happen? too bad, you clicked "agree" without actually reading the very small and confusingly worded fine print). The fact that there is an absolutely massive amount of credit card fraud every single day is pathetic, and its laughable how easy it is to collect peoples credit card numbers. Plus easy to game the system for your own benefit.  Why should this shit even happen in the first place?

uh, really? It wouldnt add bloat at all.. it would literaly just be "display all prices in bits" or "display all prices in mBTC", which just changes where the decimal on prices shows up for *you* personally on the client side, no extra data needed to add for stores etc.. Its not like you would have 10 shops, 5 of them using 
"bits", another using mBTC, one using uBTC and another just regular BTC, causing lots of confusion. It would all look standardised for you depending on your client settings

You can make a valid bitcoin address out of pretty much anything. Generating the private key that corresponds to it though is an entirely different beast. You could probably run a vanity key generator for long enough and be able to get "1Counterparty", but the longer and more specific the vanity address is, it gets exponentially harder to find the private key for it. The probability of generating the key for an address with that many consecutive X's is so tiny that you could have thousands of computers search for it for the rest of human history and they probably won't find it ever. Its effectively impossible

@_date: 2014-04-05 00:22:32
I dont think so. Because when you are paying with the PoS system with your card, the money is really just transferring to another trusted bank account, possibly even the same bank. The merchant isnt actually handling any of the money, just giving the customer the receipt and the device to pay. Its also all in the same currency.  So when you are giving bitcoin back as change, you are basically acting like an exchange. Are you able to give pesos or yen back to people as change? (actual question)
I think a better idea would be to use bitcoin as a points system. Every $1 they spend gets them 1 cent worth of BTC and they can cash out at any time. You could also have certain items that gets them significantly more "points", then just jack up the markup on those items. In order to get BTC they need to buy a ton of your useless crap for high prices :p

The thing about Cyrpus though... there was *never* a big adoption of BTC there and even though people always act like it is, it was not the primary driver in the rise from $10-ish all the way to $260 around this time last year (which most dont realize because this sub reddit was like 1/4 the size). 
The price of bitcoin was already rising really fast for the past month or so and picking up speed. first block reward halving, ASICs finally start coming online, wordpress, reddit, 4chan, piratebay and a bunch of others all started to accept it, silk road still in full operation, etc.. Then the whole cyprus "banking crisis" thing went down and was all over the news. The bitcoin community jumped all over it and basically went "wow look at how fucked these banks are, this could be a great use case for bitcoin!". Somehow the hype train turned that into "people in cyprus taking out all their money and buying bitcoin" and now a ton of articles cite the cyprus situation as being one of the main causes of the price spike, even though there has never been much evidence to suggest that is what was happening.
So danny from neo&amp;bee was actually from the UK and moved to cyprus just to start that business? I wonder, did he go there with the intent to introduce BTC to the population, or did he go there thinking it was already taking off and he would get a shit ton of customers right away?

Oh yes, there are definitely plenty of coins With way faster block times. All it is is changing a few variables to say find a block average every 10 or 30 seconds instead of 10 minutes. Not exactly a technical feat... 
I'm not entirely sure what the relevance of public perception of bitcoin and other Cryptos is when looking at confirmation times. 
Another thing to consider is the security. Dogecoin is what, 1 min block time? To have more or less the same security as a single bitcoin confirmation, you would need 10 dogecoin confirmations. Recommended number of confirms to be absolutely sure of security in a BTC transaction is 6. That's 60 dogecoin confirmations for roughly equal amount. Blockchain security comes from the amount of time + computing power it takes to get a block inserted into the chain.  If you have a 1 second block time, suddenly it becomes pretty easy for you to pull off a couple confirms, and then mine a slightly longer chain which invalidates those confirmations, essentially creating a double spend.
Also worth noting that for most semi low value, PoS, in person or personal (someone you know) transactions, you do not need to wait for confirmations, unless you plan on spending that coin again immediately. As long as the transaction propagates fast enough through the whole network (true 99% of the time), it is extremely difficult to create a successful 0 conf double spend. Most cases you can accept the transaction as soon as you see it in your client or a block explorer and assume it will confirm soon or eventually.
 Funnily, bitcoin network can actually propogate much faster than any of the alts do due to the size of the network. I remember recently I sent some BTC from my phone to my main wallet. By the time my eyeballs moved up from my phone to the computer monitor, the transaction already popped up for me on blockchain.info. conversely, I sent some doge from a server wallet I have to my main doge wallet not long ago. Didn't even see the transaction show up for at least a minute or 2

How about instead of a "respected publication", they bring in "respected members from the bitcoin community"?

dont bother taking out a loan, your only going to screw yourself over.
unless you have access to cheap electricity and *several* thousand to invest in hardware, dont even bother mining either. At least not with bitcoin. You MIGHT be able to make some amount worthwhile from merge mining various alt coins, but seeing as you are wanting to just get into cloud mining thats probably over your head. dont bother with cloud mining
a better idea would be to use what you can spare and afford to lose to buy up bitcoin. Set most of it aside in a secure wallet, and give yourself a percentage to play around with and make investments. There are a number of dividend paying crypto stocks and investments that you can get. 
Here are a few links:
* 
* 
* 
* 
You could also try your hand at a small amount of strict day trading which could potentially bring you in a bit extra income if you are careful.
**Key points**: dont get a loan. start a bitcoin savings wallet. only invest a smallish percentage of your BTC and most importantly in general dont invest more than you can afford to lose.

its not safe but its also not unreasonably safe for most small PoS purchases. Always wait for confirmations if there is a good chunk of money in player. For a cup of coffee though, just give them the damn cofee and call it done. Even if they have the know how and capability to attempt a double spend, its not even a garunteed success rate (unless you control the majority of all mining nodes). Its not really as simple as just sending a transaction, then sending it again immediately but with a higher tx fee.

Seems like you are unable to look at the bigger picture. Political donations via bitcoin is just a gimmick (and if it weren't, then that would mean bitcoin is succeeding). Not trying to insult, but you are clearly a centralist (even admitting you are only in this for the money and power), which is ultimately incompatible with the crypto economy and thus you probably won't get very far in this space, IMHO.
You really think that we should go back to using gold coins and gold bars for trade on a global scale in the age of the internet? If you dont want fiat or banks but want the gold standard.. that means that you cant have paper currency or digital currency at all and can only have physical coins. Also, what happens when we start mining moons and asteroids (hypothetically, but there actually are companies trying to start this) and come back with tonnes upon tonnes of gold, basically doubling (or more) the world gold supply? When we inevitably figure out how to harvest extraterrestrial resources, there will be no such thing as material scarcity, which kills the whole idea of the gold standard. The only way to create true scarcity in the new age is artificially using math. Hence, Bitcoin. 
Security for individuals, price stability, user friendliness and people *actually* knowing and caring about it... those are all temporary problems (actually, opportunities).

Honestly I havnt put too much thought into it all or even read through their actual business plan but that makes a lot of sense. Sure, quite a few people have heard about bitcoin by now, but most are still clueless and a lot of misinformation going around. BTC is nowhere near the point where you can just setup a store front, make some advertisements and expect people to come to you en masse. Vast majority who are or might be interested will just sit at home on their computer with no pants on, learn about it and maybe use one of the many already established online services instead

BITCOIN PLEASE...... bitcoin...please..?". Meanwhile everyone in line is staring at you like a dumbass, wondering why you keep saying "bitcoin" over and over without actually doing anything.

I think you could use the idea in a number of ways. A sidechain has its own miners, its own blockchain, its own system. The only link is the primary currency peg/transfer mechanism to the bitcoin main blockchain. Why couldnt you have a secondary currency with its own distribution (mining rewards or whatever), properties etc. on top of that? You can basically do the same thing as any alt-coin could do, but there would just be that extra currency unit thats tied to the BTC network. All you need then is a decentralized exchange mechanism (similar to what counterparty does) for using the sidechain BTC to purchase the alt-coin unit (Doge for example), and now all of a sudden you have an alt-coin that doesnt require any interaction with an exchange website to obtain, besides mining etc.

except that is a completely bullshit number. Take the current price, times it by the total number of bitcoins mined in the past day, and then divide that by total number of transactions a day. That is literaly what that calculation is. How in the fuck does that make any sense as being the "cost" per transaction? 
If the number of transactions goes up, but price stays the same, then that number goes lower. There could be the exact same amount of electricity and hash power being poured into mining, but if the price drops even lower, then somehow that magically makes the "cost per transaction" much lower. Or if the price goes up, then that magically makes every transaction more expensive? Again, how does that make sense?
That stat on blockchain.info is completely meaningless, and also implies that the network becomes even more expensive to run the more transactions go through it... as if everytime I make a transaction, someone somewhere is paying $18 bucks. In reality, the amount of transactions doesnt matter at all and the actual cost factors in the network  are electricity, hardware, bandwidth and data storage for nodes and miners, which is largely affected by the blockchain difficulty level.

PHP is totally fine for developing financial applications or most other web applications really. The problem really comes from the fact that there is ALOT of really, really bad PHP programmers. The way PHP is designed, you can easily get away with writing awful programming, and generally the program itself will still run (for example, if you try and use a variable that doesnt exist yet, PHP will just create one for you). This, combined with the mass popularity of it = many idiot developers. The language itself and its built in library also has alot of inconsistencies, which can be frustrating, especially coming from another language.
Really, it all comes down to the skill of the programmer. If you are a good programmer and already are familiar with the quirks of PHP, you can create efficient and secure applications just fine.  
Its the programmer that matters, not the programming language (to a point though... cant always just try and fit everything into PHP if it would clearly work better with something else)

If you tried to use your bank account the same way you are using your bitcoin wallet (for taking business payments and constant testing moving money back and forth. as others have said you would have had to make ~1000 transactions to pay that much in fees), they would probably close your account on you or at least freeze it (maybe thinking its been compromised or something). Unless you have an actual business account (which isnt free) then they frown pretty badly on using your account like that. Its happened to me before just from taking like 6 or 7 payments from people on localbitcoins over the span of a few days.
Im sure the amount of fees you would be paying if you used bitcoin like your personal bank account (storing money or using for regular day to day purchases or bills), the total fees spent would be fairly trivial. Although apparently you are already getting a pretty good deal with your bank. The vast majority of people actually pay bank fees.

Same thing happened to me earlier this (err.. last) year. I can tell you right now that the banks are going to be total cunts about it. You probably wont get your money back and you will probably now be banned from using interac e-transfers. I even had my bank account totally frozen for 2 weeks and then forced to close it after said 2 weeks because of it. 
 Iv personally talked through probably 12+ people between multiple banks (and this was after switching banks and using a different email than I did before) and certapay (the main company that handles e-transfers) and all of them have been completely useless. Still cant send e-transfers, and any transfers I try to accept get immediately blocked and not even returned to the sender for several days (which was awesome when I was trying to accept some rent money...)
ALWAYS make sure you get a copy of their government photo ID, proof of address and a statement of intent to purchase (something like "I {customer name} agree to pay {seller name} {x amount of dollars} for {x amount of bitcoins} via localbitcoins.com on {current date}) before accepting ANY e-transfers from somebody on localbitcoins. And dont forget to make sure that their name on their ID actually matches what shows up on the email transfer. If you do this, it should filter out most of the scammers, and if they do try and fuck you over anyways, you at least have some decent ammo to bring to the bank other than just the localbitcoins receipt
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:46:40
yeah, thats true... but how does that relate to my comment? I was talking about the "cost per transaction" stat on blockchain.info, not how miners behave or operate. 
Also if they are doing 10% and getting 250 BTC a day, they are getting that amount (plus fees) no matter if there is 100 transactions or 100,000. When the block reward halves, if they want to keep getting that full 250 like you mention, either transaction volume would have to increase an insane amount and/or transaction fees would have to be way way higher. It doesnt really cost anything to include more transactions in a block (to a point), so I dont think we will see miners just ignoring transactions that dont have a much higher fee, unless it is at a point where there are so many transactions being made constantly that block space actually becomes competitive.

they basically just take the current average price of bitcoin, the amount of transactions confirmed, a made up estimate of how much power has been consumed, and an average electricity cost and then use that to figure out the supposed real cost of each transaction.

Wait, what? Are you joking? Everything you just said is incredibly ignorant. 
Bitcoin development is extremely active, just go look at the github and the latest release notes (and that's only for the reference client). And no it is not "only bug fixes and features already planned In the beginning by satoshi' l. Give me a break... Do you even program?
The ghosts algorithm is in no way proven or tried and true.. And especially since there is no actual ethereum blockchain yet, it is mostly just theoretical. You honestly think the devs should risk screwing up a network worth billions of dollars based on theory and not 5+ years of proving it works?
I think you misunderstand what a confirmation actually is. In no way at all do you need to make a customer wait 10 minutes to an hour + for their payment to confirm. If you actually use Bitcoin, you know that transactions take only a few seconds tops to propagate. Its the same thing as when a credit card transaction clears... Would you make a customer wait 30 to 60 days for their cc transaction to clear and totally confirm before giving them their product? Its silly, though unfortunately a lot of merchants don't understand this yet and don't think that the transaction is " sent" until it is confirmed. And yeah, technically accepting 0-conf opens up potential double spends... But that is orders of magnitude more difficult than credit card fraud and not even a 100% success rate. Plus there are very few situations where double spending is profitable (products never ship within the 10 minutes or whatever, accounts and digital content can be revoked, and in person you are typically on camera etc)
Sidechains are just a theory which no one and no coin has successfully implemented and the theory itself has a lot of security concerns. People love to talk about it as a solution to everything, but it doesn't even exist yet. Some of the core devs  have been pushing for it, but there hasn't been an official "ya we all agree, so let's build this". Again, all theory...

Mt gox was one of the larger exchanges (used to be largest). They have had tons of issues in the past and terrible support, stopped fiat withdrawals for a while and just recently halted all bitcoin withdrawals. Which means that everybody who had bitcoin in the exchange could no longer it out
Long story short, they have made alot of fuckups and everyone believes they are now insolvent and possibly had the majority of their coins stolen (about 750,000 BTC apparantly) over time thanks to bugs in their software. Now they have closed down all trading and replaced the entire website with just a blank page with a meaningless statement on it.
Apparantly there was a shit ton of people stupid enough to keep several hundred or even several thousand BTC sitting on their exchange wallets, and the general consensus is that those are now gone for good. Hence the total shitstorm

The precise answer IS that its near impossible. The total amount of possible addresses is unfathomably large.

Honestly, I think you should do what someone else mentioned and put your money where your mouth is - go fly down to Florida for a weekend and investigate in person. You will never be fully satisfied with any response given over the internet.

yeah, most major chains in the US also have an arm in canada. Im a bit weary still though, bought a papa johns gift card on gyft once only to find out papa johns canada doesnt accept it. Really makes no sense why they wouldnt, its the same damn company, but for some reason canada always seems to get things way later.

I for one can't wait till another community (preferebly not reddit or default install of sms-forums, i.e bitcointalk... lets try something different) finally comes around and picks up traction. As it stands right now there is really only and bitcointalk.
anyone who has been around on reddit for a while knows about the problems common with popular subs (I think the rule of thumb is, once 20,000+ subscribers, things go down hill). Stupid memes, constant repeated posts/questions, circle-jerk-ery, trolls etc. are all common issues among a lot of sub-reddits. Some more aggressively than other (like r/bitcoin)
and then theres bitcointalk. Completely ugly design and bad UI (seriously, why is it using a default forum theme? and a shitty one at that. what is this, 2003?). Mods and long time forum members frequently abuse their status (worse than here), attempting to silence and/or troll anyone that disagrees with them or they don't like (some perps off the top of my head: mpoe-pr, mem, luke-jr).  Poorly organized. Been hacked multiple times.. countless trolls and scammers.. home to scams such as the whole pirate40 thing, among so many others... Oh ya and the 3000+ bitcoins that were set aside to upgrade the forums, which of course never happened.
And the best part is both these communities are ran by the same circle of people..

400 000 000 worth of bitcoin, but not 400 billion bitcoin. That number could easily be much larger or much smaller depending on what day they decided to use the price quote and from what exchange.

No kidding. You even talk to or answer questions for the bitcoin foundation or some other generally un-liked group/org (like any regulators, or the guys that came up with coinvalidation etc.) and your immediately accused of working in some sort of evil conspiracy to take over bitcoin and turn it into "gov-coin" or something. seems pretty over the top
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:47:22
Yup. Definitely adds fuel to the fire... Are people really *that* hardcore into this and so focused on the day to day price that they are actually ready and willing to take their own life if the price drops passed a certain point? I get that some people have invested more than they can really afford to lose, but damn, that's retarded. Do they really think that this is it, game over, bitcoin is dead and won't come back and now they have lost everything? 
Im inclined to believe that those types of people are a pretty tiny percentage (if they even exist - not saying they dont though), and posting on reddit a commonly known phone number probably is not going to help their situation (... I guess if just one person gets talked out of it though, thats good?). It has just become some sort of weird tradition for these "suicide hotline" posts to be made whenever there is a big price drop, ever since that one time when it got on the top of the front page and made its rounds around other areas on reddit.

@_date: 2014-05-27 17:28:37
it really depends completely on who you ask. a lot of people have totally different visions in their mind.
IMO, if bitcoin was to be adopted by people and regions en masse, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete collapse or meltdown of the economy, it just means people are rapidly switching to something that serves them better than the depreciating US dollar. 
Maybe it would actually take a economic meltdown in order for the general population to embrace cryptocurrencies. Or maybe we just need the right killer app, or the right amount of merchant adoption. Or maybe it will never happen. Its hard to say and nobody actually knows.

LTB dev here, I think you mean "Token Controlled Access" :p. This gist of it is we have a "proof of ownership" process which users can go through to prove that they are actually the owner of the bitcoin addresses that they add to their account. Proof can be made be either signing a secret message with your address, or by "verification-by-donation", where you send us a small donation *from* your specific bitcoin address (making the donation with a different address won't count). Once the address is verified, we start tracking your BTC and Counterparty token balances. From there we can do things like make certain pages, features or user permissions available only to someone who holds at least X amount of BTC or LTBcoin or whatever :D

Yep. Looking at the Color Coins asset directory now, looks like there is a handful of small projects using it actually (last time I checked about a month ago, it was almost entirely joke and test assets like "Penis", plus the CoinPrism wallet is borderline unusable...). There is really no contest though.. Essentially the only advantage that Colored Coins had was that you didnt need some kind of altcoin (i.e XCP) to create assets, only needing to spend a BTC miners fee. However counterparty now allows the creation of free assets which are way more powerful.. so yeah.
I also have quite a bit of security concerns and see some red flags with the CoinPrism wallet and the people behind it (for instance, actually recommending to users that they just delete their private keys if they want to "lock in" the number of tokens issued for an asset, which is absurd..)

If you can see it then like 99.99% of the time its going to confirm eventually. On rare occasions it can take an hour or more to confirm ( like if they paid too small a fee). The only time you would see a incoming transaction and then see it dissapear is if it was an attempted "double spend", which requires a lot of luck and timing, very difficult to actually pull off and highly impractical to do. You will probably never encounter somebody trying to double spend you. Double spends on unconfirmed payments are basically only an issue if you are an automated  gambling website accepting bets and paying out winnings without waiting for confirms
Also blockchain.info is very useful. If you copy and paste the transaction id in their search box you can see details and estimated confirmation wait time. If you see transaction on blockchain.info your golden

@_date: 2014-10-01 15:24:26
if they use counterparty then this isnt an issue at all. Counterparty doesnt depend on any specific markings being maintained by inputs in the blockchain. Instead it keeps its own database and just uses the blockchain for timestamping and historical record keeping. So for example if I send you 1000 of a counterparty token called "KARMA", it takes a little bit of BTC with the transaction to get it sent to you, however you can freely spend the BTC received without affecting what counterparty tokens you have. So you could have completely 0 BTC left in an address, but still have the 1000 KARMA tokens. Only difference is you wouldnt be able to move or spend those tokens until you mix some BTC in
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:22:20
maybe. But if you dont actually own the private keys to your wallet, you dont actually own your bitcoin. Thats just how it is. Blockchain.info is a good example of a web wallet where you actually own and control the private key, not them. Maybe we need an exchange that features a wallet such as that, so even if it suddenly gets shut down your coin is still safe
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:03:22

@_date: 2014-12-26 04:10:52
"Secures 50x faster"... That's not how it works actually. Blockchain security is a function of time. More time = more work = higher security. 100 confirmations at 1 minute each is the same as 10 confirmations at 10 minutes each (assuming the same amount of hashing power etc.). If it were about the number of confirms and not the time spent "working", then yeah dogecoin, litecoin or whatever would all be more secure than btc, bit that's not the case
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:19:21

Your thinking about it wrong. Paper wallets are kind of like a savings account. Its not supposed to be something that you pull money from often at all. Put money in, let it sit there and know that its safe (because its not even online and if you do it properly never seen on a system thats even been online), but you are going to have to go out of your way if you want to pull it out and spend it. Its a somewhat advanced method of storage and anyone who thinks that you actually need one just to have bitcoin doesnt know what they are talking about.

not really true. Costs BTC fee to send the deposit transaction (unless you meet the zero fee requirements, which isnt too often), and withdrawals typically come with some sort of withdrawal fee, plus you need to wait for confirmations etc.. still pretty good, but not exactly "free" or "instant". Just cheap and relatively fast

my opinion is that maybe alot of the finicky speculators who actively bought/sold like crazy on any good or bad news were mostly in MtGox and are now taken out of the game for the most part. That and maybe people are starting to become a bit more reasonable. Less panic selling thinking BTC is about to completely crash just because of some hack or arrest or some other issue. Less panic buying thinking we are going to go to $5,000 or $10,000/BTC  at any moment

Sure, decentralizatiom is great and can improve things in a lot of areas... But its not really possible or even ideal or advantagous to totally decentralize absolutely everything.

no, the actual point is the guys selling this documentary dont know what they are doing. In no way whatsoever do you need to wait for even a single confirmation for the  sale of a digital copy of a movie. Even if they try and 0-conf double spend you, its digital and cost you nothing. It would be far easier just to go download a torrent for free then attempt to scam them, so why bother with the confirmation wait? especially 6? The right thing to do would be to just have the best consumer experience you can give and just give them the damn movie right away.
@_date: 2014-12-30 02:02:28
Yep, even if you do manage to attempt a double spend (much harder than credit card fraud), its not even a 100% garunteed success. So at best you give yourself a chance to *maybe* get something for free, but even then the number of situations where a double spend could be profitable is very limited. E.g accounts can be revoked or suspended, digital content you can already pirate for free anyways, you would often be on camera if in a face to face transaction etc etc.

I find it hard to believe that "TNW" was able to reach out and get a response from an actual google official executive that fast. 
Also, I cant really prove this but in /new just before this article showed up, there was another one (might have even been the same site) which was exactly the same, except quoted googles response of no plans for bitcoin as back in 2013... which is now conveniently gone, and that post got deleted shortly after.

you didnt lose anything unless you are dumb enough (unless you really need it) to sell at a price lower than what you paid for (or what the value was when you received it). or bought something during a price dip in which the price of the product/service is pegged to another currency. When the price fluctuates, I dont look at my 1 BTC and think "oh I have $700 oh wait now I have $650... 800 .. and now its 500" . I think "I have 1 bitcoin". 1 BTC =  1 BTC. Sure, changes in the price do effect my spending and selling habits (much more tempting to actually spend it or cash some out during an upswing. more tempting to just save during a downswing), but exchange rate has zero effect on how much I actually have.
Its kind of like if it cost $2 USD for 1 Euro, and you get 1000 euros. If the exchange price drops to $1.50 / 1 Euro, you dont all of a sudden only have $1500 instead of $2000. All you have is 1000 euro. 
Furthermore, no one is claiming bitcoin is a stable currency. It obviously isnt at this point in the game. And you have to remember this is still an experimental technology. Its nowhere near ready for joe blow to use daily or your average person to store all of their wealth in it.

All you have to do is go look at the website for ["PayCoin"](
*  "new blockchain technique, near instant transactions, extremely secure" - yeah ok then.. I dont think they know how blockchain security works
* "specifically built to work with legacy credit card systems" - through their centralized company I am assuming?
* "Coin Adoption Fund" - a centralized fun-money fund for their company?
* "launches with more merchant adoption than any cryptocurrency in history" - wow, so everyone who wasnt interested in taking bitcoin is suddenly going to start using PayCoin of all things? also "in history" sounds silly when its only been like 5 years. 
* "backed by a fiat-based reserve of USD " - why the hell would we want that in a cryptocurrency? And I assume that reserve will be held by the centralized company in a single bank account.
Surprise surprise, no code or proof of concept or anything. Just yet another "whitepaper". What is with the obsession with "whitepapers" in this community? Maybe I am just naive, but I have never seen the term "whitepaper" used so much (if at all) in any other community or industry. 
Here is an idea: How about we all collectively decide to stop with the bullshit marketing, whitepapers and IPOs and actually release some real applications and proof of concepts first? The flow should be idea -&gt; proof of concept -&gt; MVP -&gt; marketing -&gt; money -&gt; product. Too many companies seem to conveniently skip over 2 or 3 of those crucial steps.

An exchange is not a bank. You can have bitcoin banks (actual ones that are insured.. not really existing yet but its possible), web based wallets, phone, desktop or paper wallets. Just dont keep it in an exchange.

@_date: 2014-03-02 21:25:18
Ok, fair enough. Well, I guess if you cant be bothered to take basic security precautions with your PC then bitcoin isnt really for you. And with things like cold storage, such a situation simply could not happen. You cant keylog something that has never been typed and never been online. 
It is far, far easier to get peoples credit card numbers and just go to town with them, and it happens all the time. I do agree though that we need some advances in wallet security before its really viable for the common person that knows nothing about computers. Hardware wallets come to mind
@_date: 2014-04-12 23:20:37
are they though? The only difference really is the money supply is fixed and tied directly to bitcoin, and ideally uses a block discovery algorithm that can be merge mined with bitcoin, allowing miners to pick it up easily.  Other than that it would be its own seperate system, seperate blockchain and everything. You can have super fast confirmations or whatever you want. You could probably even get around the money supply issue by having a secondary set of tokens awarded to miners which has a unique purpose in the network
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:20:04

@_date: 2014-09-27 01:35:07
Ok, Il bite. 


people said the same thing when it jumped to the $20 range then crashed. Or when it got to $250 then crashed, and then again when it got to 1200+. Also this thought only applies if you are looking to make a quick buck off of just the fact that you bought coins cheap/cheaper rather than making money by actually doing something productive


IMO the overall dropping price this year is due to a) the fall of Mt Gox, which turns out was running various internal trading bots that many believe was one of the main causes of the huge price spike between november and january (i.e, artificial rise).. b) many more merchants that people can spend BTC with, including some big names.. most of which convert to fiat almost right away, putting further downward pressure on the price... and c) lots of coins being sold off as some people are lining their bank accounts with their new found riches. There is still plenty of demand and its still growing, but the supply of coins being moved on the markets is outpacing it (and not because of mining). 


Yeah, its true that's a pretty long time from now... but that's missing the point actually. Predictability is the actual main point, not the eventually finite supply. We know for a fact that on average there will be 25 new bitcoins made every 10 minutes, and roughly every 4 years this amount will be cut in half until it either reaches 0 in 100-ish years or the bitcoin network dies off. Being able to know and predict the exact increase in money supply and rate of inflation over the course of the next 100+ years is pretty powerful. Contrast that to the US fed reserve where no one really knows what they are doing and they can basically change things on a whim whenever they want (ok not exactly, but you know what I mean)


The transactions themselves (when on the blockchain) are extremely secure. The exchange websites though.. that's a different story.. and is up to the individual companies and their implementations. Its quite possible to have a secure exchange, you just need to not have idiots (see mtgox) running them.  Security for credit cards (the primary way for paying stuff online) is completely laughable.. like, really bad. Sure, you can make chargebacks and get your money back, but that is not the same as having an actually secure system. Also there is no reason you couldn't have insurance using bitcoin if there is a demand for it. There is also the fact that the existing banking system is painfully slow.. so not only are you paying all kinds of fees, but you have to wait "3 - 5 business days" or even more just to do much of anything. 


Litecoin is just a slightly modified clone of bitcoin, it doesnt do anything particularly better or even bring anything new to the table (it uses Scrypt to mine instead of SHA256... which was first implemented by another bitcoin clone that came before litecoin). It's also *easier* to mine, not harder.. in fact that was basically the whole point of litecoin. Bitcoin is by far the most difficult and expensive to mine.


Lol. I think you mean Ripple? AFAIK its a system of credit, not even really trying to compete with bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies. 


The total supply doesnt really grow *that* much each day, and its not like every single coin thats mined gets immediately sold. See one of my previous points.. price decline has far more to do with various other factors than the new supply introduced from mining. Also, why couldnt the demand keep growing? If anything it could grow even faster than it is. Some simple math shows that if this thing truly takes off in the mainstream, then we are just at the very tip of the iceberg right now. Very early days still


Almost every single one of the other cryptocurrencies requires bitcoin first in order to purchase. Not very much fiat cash is going directly into other crypto's at all. The flow typically looks like USD (or w/e) -&gt; BTC -&gt; Dogecoin/Litecoin/etc. 


What does that even mean? Dont think OP's friend understands how mining works,  you cant just suddenly "discover" how to mine a ton more bitcoins. 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes average, thats it. Only thing you can do is lower that 10 minute average, which will just result in the entire system adjusting itself to bring it back to 10 minutes.


Cool. The vast majority of USD (or pick any currency) is "just numbers" stored on computers in various places. Numbers which said "regulated" governments are apparently terrible at managing (see the undercover goldman sachs/fed reserve recordings). Whats your point?

Exactly. It seems like one of the biggest points here is that he built up quite a lot of trust from people by actually delivering hardware for a while and actually mining. So now when all these obvious red flags are pointed out, a lot of people just deny it because *they* received hardware a while ago or *they* made their ROI off whatever they invested originally. Its a pretty clever operation, but the house of cards is falling

Thanks for the response, upvoted. 
I think it pretty much boils down to weird quirks etc. in the PHP language combined with loose standards means that finding a PHP developer that can produce quality code can be quite hard. Not impossible though.
You are right, PHP would not be my main choice if I were already a skilled programmer and looking for a new language to focus on. For me personally, PHP is what I started with (but have learned several languages since) and is what I have the most experience with. It works just fine for building fairly basic web applications (such as a blog, or forums).  More complex things like a trading engine and custom bitcoin implementations (looking at you Karpeles...) are definitely in the list of things NOT suitable for PHP though

@_date: 2014-03-30 15:39:04
thats actually a very good point. I guess in that case, there needs to be a small level of trust still. If you have the technical capability, you can read the source code yourself and perform tests to confirm your suspicions, but for most people you basically have to trust that if it is a scam, somebody from the tech community will call it out and hopefully you will find out about it before its too late. Although you also have to trust the randomness of any private key generator for pretty much any wallet or service

If they want a return, I would either just give them straight up USD, or give them the amount of BTC that they sent to you.
E.g, they bought something from you for 10 BTC. They want a return a few days later, and the price just happens to have gone up or down a few hundred. Just send them the 10 BTC back. 
If you  have say 1 BTC and its worth 1000 when you get it... If you start thinking "oh now I have 1100, oh wait now 900, now 950) etc. it just makes things overly complicated, especially when it comes to refunds. Because really, you dont have 1100, or 900 etc. You have 1 bitcoin. The amount of bitcoin you own doesnt change with the exchange price. Exchange rate only comes into play if you are spending that coin directly on something priced based on the exchange, or if you are wanting to sell your coin at that moment. And I dont see any reason why you should get more or less bitcoin back as a return than what you originally sent just becaues the price has fluctuated. because it could just as easily go back to the same value as what it was a day or 2 later.

First off, if you have never used bitcoin before and are getting your first bitcoin, dont sweep the funds to a cold storage wallet. You could easily screw something up then suddenly you cant decrypt your private key or something. Never know. And its not like if you setup a normal wallet on your phone (mycelium) or desktop (electrum) all of a sudden you will be hacked and they will be gone. Not like that at all. Just dont download keyloggers (which you should already not be doing) and you will be fine.
So basically, first thing you want to do is setup either mycelium or electrum. give me a BTC address and I can send you a small amount to play with just to get use to how transactions work. Once you wrap your head around it, your golden. Just remember to always make backups

So what if they dont subscribe to the ideologies and just want to make money?  If they are accepting it for payments in some form, they obviously don't think it's completely retarded or a scam or ponzi scheme etc.


Microsoft is orders of magnitude larger than tiger direct and also completely different. People are not going to be buying bitcoin just so they can order some computer parts from a specific website. However the millions of kids on xbox live being able to pay for xbox live subscription and purchase games, movies, DLC etc.... and none of them able to use credit cards (unless its their parents). I would say thats a pretty big difference. 
In reality probably a similar thing will happen. Huge influx of sales, then it drops and levels off for a while. That doesnt even matter right now though because by the sounds of it, they are thinking about the long term growth

yes, if the network sees that you have just attempted to spend money, most nodes will automatically drop/reject you if you try and spend the same money (i.e, same transaction inputs) again. Even if both transactions manage to stay in the pool of unconfirmed payments (unlikely), only one will ever confirm. Even with a higher fee on the second transaction, there is no garuntee that it will get picked up and confirmed instead of the 1st transaction.

I agree, I think that consumer adoption will be a major focus of 2015. We have a lot of the merchant adoption in place already, some huge names involved like Microsoft and Dell, and a lot more things in the pipelines (like paypal releasing their btc integration etc. and lots more we don't know about). Starting to become quite a few places you can use it.. so the next step will be the next generation of exchanges, ATMs and such and maybe even some of these companies actively advertising their bitcoin payment options

I would say a major factor is it would open up a truly global market. Now anyone anywhere in the world no matter age/nationality/status etc. can purchase games from them if they have bitcoins. Instead of only being able to buy with credit cards which a lot of people dont have and many places you cant even get them.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:00:01
no, buying/selling on exchanges has nothing to do with the blockchain itself. However we can see the 30K transaction on the blockchain moving into the exchange (someone linked to this somewhere today, I forget what post I found it in though). If these were really old coins (i.e early adopter) moving, days destroyed would have a huge spike today
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:45:05
use them to mine altcoins, you wont make much just mining bitcoin. There is a bajillion alt-coins so fairly easy to get some actual coin from it, and you can just sell them for BTC. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:27:32
I think that the fall of Mt Gox is one of the main reasons that "good news" no longer makes the price jump up. There was A LOT of people using mt gox and a large amount of them even using it as their main wallet and savings (usually the same people that hardly understand bitcoin and just want to profit in some $). Gox collapsing completely wiped out a ton of speculators and a lot of the types of people that buy/sell pretty much purely on the news cycle. Also the price crash in general has probably spooked a lot of would-be day traders/speculators
@_date: 2014-11-27 18:48:03
wait... what? 


It is not possible nor needed to be able to prove that a coin cannot be re-issued.
wow. I actually like colored coins overall, but that right there completely kills it for a lot of different projects and use cases. In a lot of instances, there is very valid reasons to be able to have the supply of a token/asset be permanently set in stone. Just saying "oh yeah the private key is totally deleted" is not a solution

That's interesting, I was with RBC as well when that happened. They are totally bullshitting you... Unless maybe its different for "fraud"..? I don't know if the guy was actually just scamming me or if it was a hacked bank account. Also I'm convinced most of the bank employees don't know shit. Almost everyone I talked to told me totally different things or just sent me to another department where I would have to explain everything again. Also, rbc told me I "shouldn't be doing these types of transactions" and then told me I should close my account with them after my account gets unfrozen
Since I started taking id s though I have never had one problem. For one if you are willing to send someone your id and personal info, you probably arnt going to try and pull anything funny. That and it gives you much better proof that they actually were the ones paying you, rather than only having the receipt from LocalBitcoins.

This is so cherry picked on CC's side.. I like that you dont mention that colored coins *require* a compatible wallet otherwise you can easily "uncolor" and destroy tokens, which is not possible in counterparty. That is probably one of the biggest negative points to me...
Personally I would like to see less articles and comparisons about why X protocol is better and more actions and actual projects and active use cases. I have yet to see any serious non-wallet project or operation using colored coins, or even mastercoin (besides maidsafe)
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:32:08

sounds like a load of BS. The market price of bitcoin is in no way linked to what is going on in ukraine or the gold and oil markets. Its also pretty clear now that news and events going on in the bitcoin world and the world in general do not necessarily cause any price changes (just look at the past few months where the price has been relatively stable.. plenty of news coming out both good and bad, price barely budges. also I highly doubt that there are hordes of people that actually buy/sell based purely off of articles that they read that day or week).
Most likely reason for price change: supply and demand. somebody is buying up a bunch of coin for whatever reason and restricting the supply (there was a single 700 BTC buy last week if I recall)
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:05:08
No, they didn't. Well, some probably did, but not very many. I was referring to when they had the whole capital controls stuff over in Cyprus, there was a bunch of articles and threads like this which gave some people the impression that tons of Cypriots (...?) had discovered bitcoin and were moving their wealth into it. People keep pointing to that event as one of the primary reasons for the spike to $250 in early 2013... In reality the price was already skyrocketing before that stuff even happened, and the whole Cyprus deal was hugely overstated.

Thats not true. The only thing you can do is a) double spend money from your own wallets and b) prevent/delay other transactions from confirming. Having 50+% hashpower doesnt magically give you the ability to screw with everyones wallets beyond making their transactions take alot longer.
@_date: 2014-04-13 15:41:03

I totally agree. For me, its just so nice not having to deal with stupid banking nonsense. Not having to work around banking hours, no paying monthly fees, no having to enter in so much personal information just to pay for something online.. not having to worry wether or not the website or business im paying is going to rip off my identity or credit card... knowing that there isnt some bank employee looking at my transactions, or getting a call based on those transactions from the bank trying to sell me something or thinking that im up to something suspicious... and if I come up with a cool website or app or something that makes it big and all of a sudden I have tons of money coming in, I dont have to deal with things like the bank freezing my accounts because im making more money than usual so that must be suspicious. Or having to fill out forms and other crap.

I was just commenting on you saying its a "volatile worthless currency which cant be exchanged for actual  money". Not in the context of the ukraine protesters (off topic I know). 
Localbitcoins can be risky if your not careful yes. Pretty simple to stay out of trouble though. 1) dont use a personal bank account (use a business one) 2) dont accept peoples money without at least a quick ID verification 3) dont do trades with somebody that is telling you the various illegal things they are going to use it for... and 4) limit your volume. Pretty hard to stay off the radar if you are moving 50K or 100K a month or something
@_date: 2014-02-01 00:59:02
in its most simple form, its just a matter of writing down your private key somewhere and hiding it (pretty much all clients let you "dump" your private key).  Then afterwards delete all traces of the wallet so it is not even on a computer anymore.
there are better and more complicated ways to do it though, like booting off of a linux USB, not even being connected to the internet or anything while creating a new wallet
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:14:30
I doubt it. It's not like everyone in Russia knows about bitcoin already and also happens to be able to easily purchase it. Not to mention even if they did move all their money into it, they couldn't live off of it since few places outside the internet accept it, especially in Russia... I think it helps our cause over the long run, but don't expect the price to explode anytime soon because of it

"e-tailors".. ugh
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:27:16
its not even really much of an issue. It only effects unconfirmed transactions and the problem is actually developers that don't know how to handle transactions properly. In the case of Mt. Gox which supposedly was the worst effected by it, basically their system was auto re-sending withdrawals if it didnt see a certian transaction ID confirm. You should never rely solely on a transaction ID for unconfirmed transactions

I run earnfreebitcoins , which is sort of a faucet, and about 100,000 users a month. Each output you send on your grouped transaction needs to be at least 55ubtc (0.000055) otherwise your transactions might take really really long to confirm or even get rejected outright.
I just let each user build up at least 0.000055, then send in groups to of a couple dozen addresses or so at a time. Remember the more addresses you send to the bigger your transaction will be and the higher the fee you will need to pay in order for it to confirm in a timely manner
Hope that helps

The people that would torrent and use your stock footage or photos for free were most likely not going to pay you anyways, that's why they are going out of their way to get free stuff in the first place. The type of shady people that actively pirate content for use in their business and make money off it are pretty rare, and again probably wouldn't have paid you anyway, they would just find some other way to cheap out for their shitty schemes, and likely not ever be a serious competitor anyways.
Also stealing implies taking something away from somebody so they can't have it but you do, which is not what file sharing is. Your "possible future potential sales" isn't something that can be stolen from you, you just need to adapt and get better at marketing and selling your shit.
Have you seen any actual declines in your income that can be shown to be a direct result of piracy, or is the primary impact on you just getting upset at the thought of it happening? How come there is many media companies which are still making money hand over fist, even though I can just hop on thepiratebay and download all their stuff for free? 
There are good reasons to pay for content and media, and there is real trade offs to pirating stuff, but they can co exist with each other just fine (they already do), and you can still make a good living producing your art. Ironicly it is usually things like DRM protection and regional restrictions which end up driving people to torrents etc.. Most people do not have a problem with paying for things as long as it is reasonable and the company doesn't shit on them with all these useless restrictions (having a watermark on images and video before purchase is fine - keyword reasonable).
The internet allows for the free flow and duplication of ALL data... You can't stop it so, either adapt your business models or die.

You might be misreading that. The first test group was limited access, only open to people that bought at least 10K SJCX directly from the crowdfund (one of the perks they give you for buying in early). The second test group still requires 10K SJCX, but they can be bought from the open market (i.e, not necessarily from the storj dev team, which ended their crowd sale a long time ago.. i.e they are not exactly receiving extra funding from that). If you want to beta test the software but don't want to obtain any SJCX, you can just wait until the next testing phase which will be open to way more people, and probably better to since things will be more developed than they are now.

yeah, sure, its possible, but its not really easy for 99% of people. peter is a programmer and a core developer, so he understands how to pull it off by taking advantage of mining pools and their different rules. Its not as simple as just "make transcaction, then make another transaction with higher fee". 
I guess it *would* be possible though to create a wallet that automates this and makes it relatively easy
@_date: 2014-11-26 17:02:00


Quite frankly, that is even worse. One of the great things about counterparty is that ANY address can receive and hold any amount of assets and it does not effect any actual bitcoin they hold at all.  It does not limit you to *only* addresses which have been generated with counterwallet or whatever. 
Also, what do you have to say about the fact that counterparty is about to release on mainnet (within a few weeks) a new asset type which does not require XCP at all, only a simple miners fee (e.g similar to CC assets)?

depends. If you have to use like 500 outputs from faucet / free bitcoin site payments just to send one payment, and then try and send it with 0 fee, it could end up just being dropped or never confirming, or for a long ass time 
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:32:10
Eh, it seems like its just complicated in your case because you are deliberately making it complex. A securely generated paper wallet stored in a safety deposit box would probably have been good enough. Sure, banks suck, but securing stuff is kind of their job. Keep a backup for yourself in your own safe to maybe.
I agree though there needs to be better and simpler solutions to use methods like multi-sig, secret sharing etc.. for securing BTC. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 05:46:14
um what are you even talking about? BitID has nothing to do with licenses, "coin validation" or anything like that. Its just a way to log in to a service by signing messages with your bitcoin address (message signing is a standard bitcoin feature for proving address ownership)

No, I get what you are saying. Never say never etc..
Blockchains are essentially a decentralized  permanent record or history of something. Indexing the ever changing web in the form of a blockchain makes no sense and would be insanely inefficient. Not to mention... Why? What are the existing issues with search engines that could be solved using a blockchain?
Sure, a decentralized search solution could be invented, I just don't think it would be based on a blockchain. Maybe something like maid safe 
We can still build decentralized stuff without just saying "put it in a blockchain!!". Its not a end all perfect solution that can replace any application you can think of. Some stuff is just not suitable. 
Again, why?

The language doesn't really matter, either way you are mostly just using api calls, either to a Bitcoind server you control or through a third party service like blockchain.info

@_date: 2014-06-15 17:47:02
It really depends. How exactly are you set up? Do you just do PC support and repair locally, fairly small crowd (at the moment)? If so then its as easy as just invoicing them in BTC and giving them an address from your wallet to send to. No need to fully automate if your small and deal with people face to face.

This makes a ton of sense. Running a bitcoin core full node can already be hard to keep stable as it is, I can't imagine how it would be if we start having 10,000, 20,000, 50,000+ transactions sitting in the mempool when right now its usually well under 5000.... Plus it's already really annoying when your transaction doesnt make it into the next block, then you have to wait for yet another block to be able to move your funds again (not often but it happens). People are going to get incredibly frustrated if they have to wait 4 or 5 blocks + just to get any confirmation because there is so many people ahead of them, and they certainly are not going to give a shit about any "transaction fee market".

lol what? First off, LTB frequently has guest writers, and this is Ben's (the OP) first post that he has submitted and had published. Hardly representative of LTB itself other than the fact that it was allowed to be published.
Secondly, if you actually read the article, it is pretty polite considering the circumstance and doesnt actually really make any accusations at all. All the article is doing is asking for clarification on things that Jason has either ignored or not responded to, or things about the operation that simply do not add up. Such as:
* How much BTC has been received and spent, how much is left etc.
* Who has or has had control of these funds
* What the deal is with the BTC donation address which was randomly switched out briefly
* What the deal is with the RV that was given to him
* If he is the same Jason King who has had several failed businesses due to tax reasons as well as a online project which is allegedly a scam (which he has confirmed that is all true BTW)
Questions are not accusations, and Jason's response seems to agree that this kind of thing is needed (although his response was a bit rushed and kind of left more questions).  Are you saying that he should just shut up, stop all communication and he should sue LTB for letting an article get published that asks some hard questions? Seems silly, and I am pretty sure would raise even more pitchforks if public discussion was shut down and this was brought to court. There is no reason for it, all people are asking for is transparency. 
Just my 2 bits.

How is it as important as the 21 million coin limit, when it didn't even exist in the first releases, and was only added in as a temporary spam measure? We've never seen an actual transaction market because of the block space scarcity, so it has never been a factor - ever. We are talking about deciding weather or not to limit the network so that it caps out at a certain amount of usage, or raise it so it can actually be a widely used system around the globe.

The problem with a "search engine" on top of a blockchain is that an advanced search engine the size and sophistication of something like google would just be insanely inefficient,  if even possible at all. We are talking about basically real-time 24/7 indexing of the entire internet (which is constantly changing, sites going offline etc.) and also scanning and searching through all that data in fractions of a second. Hundreds (probably thousands) of terrabytes of data and huge datacenters filled with servers are already involved with storing info and processing searches. That's not something that you can just easily replace with a bitcoin-style program running on your average desktop or server. Even if the data from all the web-crawlers, indexers etc. was stored in a distributed way (e.g storj or maidsafe) and a big enough network to hold that data, the latency alone (largely limited by the speed of light..)  between sending search queries to each node around the globe for processing would be enough to make it painfully slow for almost everybody. It could never compete with an extremely fast and efficient centralized service like google, IMHO
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:02:15

I meant that in context of the OP that I first replied to, who compared it to the 21M coin limit. 
Alright, so block size limit is important. Do you believe it should be kept at 1MB forever, or should it be increased? If the latter, by how much and when? I think it would be appreciated if others brought forward their alternatives to Gavin's proposal.

They had to have expected at least some of it.. maybe the fraud is way worse than they thought? Just think, there are millions upon millions of stolen credit card data out there (e.g that Target hack that had like 50 million stolen.. and wasnt there another big one recently?)... I think at this point as a business I would not accept credit cards for any product or service whatsoever, there is just wayyyy too many stolen credit info floating around, not even worth it. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:28:57

Downloading and storing &gt; 100GB of data is already about as inconvenient as it gets, I don't believe that making that number a little larger will have much further effect. Furthermore, right from the beginning it was always well known that the blockchain is an infinitely   growing database. This is what you signed up for.
Any inconvenience caused by increased data usage can be countered by following my suggestions above - build better consumer facing software!
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:43:39
hmm, so take out some of the main projects that are using the blockchain, and suddenly there is not a whole lot of transactions? No shit. 
Also, at 144 blocks a day, 20MB block limit and average transaction size of 300 bytes, that is about a max of 10 million transactions a day, unless my math is way off.  
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:21:02
fair enough, my mistake. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:19:30
what I dont get is that if you can follow a couple of instructions online.. how exactly is it difficult? Does the sight of a hash string or QR code freak people out or something? There are many solutions out there including ones built into major wallet clients that are basically as simple as clicking next/ok a couple times, printing off a piece of paper, and then making a copy of and/or safely securing said piece of paper. You dont actually need to go all hardcore about it and load up a linux live CD + paper wallet gen on a fresh computer that has been wiped clean + never touched the internet and then engrave that private key into a solid piece of metal, split into 3 and store in multiple bank vaults. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:06:27
I'd be interested to hear more about why it's impossible. It shouldn't be to difficult to calculate how many transactions have happened over a time period.
@_date: 2015-05-18 04:29:22
See my [other comment]( I just made.. also I was on a phone, so it's easy to make typos, big whoop.
Your first point is pretty much exactly what I was saying. Most people are perfectly willing to pay for media, which is why there is still an insane amount of content being produced all the time, and plenty of people getting rich off of it. I don't think that the threat of copyright law is much of a factor in that though.


Your comparing apples to oranges here. Downloading a digital copy of something is inherently different than walking in to some place and taking a physical item. With shoplifting there is an actual direct and immediate cost to the business, which is not the case at all with file sharing, and no one is having anything taken away from them... the only similarity is the price tag. You might be a cheap skate and a "freeloader", but downloading something on your computer hardly makes you the equivalent of a shoplifter, get real man. 


What are you even talking about, what economic model? Nobody is "relying" on people to cheat the system or w/e... but it still happens. You can't expect a totally black and white situation where it's either 100% or 0% of consumers paying for everything. 


No your not, your paying for a product at the price the business is asking for and a price you are willing to pay, and that price isn't what it is in order to make up for any supposed losses from file sharing... My "shitty habits" do not effect you in any way other then annoying you. 


Oh, you mean anti-piracy systems were put in place as an attempt to prevent piracy? No shit, and also that's not what irony means so maybe you should note the definition of that. My point was that things like DRM actually encourage people to pirate even more, because it just pisses off paying customers and makes the free bootleg version more attractive (e.g, annoying "protections" taken out, annoying advertisements taken out etc.)


I never claimed to be the "sole decider of what the price should be", don't put words in my mouth. Turning that around... who the fuck are you to decide what data I can or can't download using the internet connection that I'm paying for?


How do you figure that?
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:43:27
the upload time is definitely the fishiest of all
@_date: 2015-05-12 14:39:10
Do you understand how nodes work? It's not even about supply and demand...At this point in time most nodes would crash if there is 100s of thousands of transactions built up in the memory pool, just due to the RAM it would use (bitcoind likes to die if it runs out of memory available). A huge mempool would also cost way more bandwidth because nodes constantly rebroadcast transactions. The only way to avoid that is to either make sure the mempool never grows that large by making sure enough transactions get confirmed fast enough (increasing the block size), or by putting a cap on the mempool size, which means that at a certain capacity the network would literaly stop accepting any new transactions, and you would run into huge propagation issues. 
This is a technical problem, not some vague economic issue that simply requires people to pay higher fees. Fees can go as high as you want, the same problem is still going to occur if too many people use the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-01-02 06:44:27
yeah, it sucks big time man. What I ended up doing was switching banks and using a totally different email when setting up e-transfer service. At first I was able to accept e-transfers again, but then I made the stupid mistake of accepting one that was sent to my old email, which caused my whole new account to be blocked again...
so basically, get a new bank, use a different email address and NEVER touch any e transfers that have come from or sent to your previous email. Unless you are luckier than me and manage to get your name totally cleared. cant hurt to try anyways
Last person I ended up talking to basically said my only hope to get everything sorted out is to go down in person to the main RBC branch downtown and try and make an appointment with one of the head managers. Except that apparently no one is allowed to make appointments for managers except for themselves. Major pain in the ass especially when you work a 9-5 job. basically have to specifically book time off just to try and catch a branch manager while they are there. 
*edit* also, unless they actually freeze your account, you should still get student loans etc. just fine since I believe those are normal deposits and not interac e-transfers
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:10:34
so, I could create a device that connects via bluetooth to any phones in a proximity, set up payments without them even knowing, and then run around yelling "bitcoin" over and over, which the phone recognizes and then authorizes/completes the payment? At what point in the process you are describing does the consumer initiate, agree to or authorize the transaction other than their phone picking up on which type of payment to use (paypal/bitcoin etc.)?
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:59:40
Oddly enough, they actually do exist, and one of those payment processor companies is one of the biggest in the space - BitPay. Not sure what rock you have been living under..  Pretty sure most of the other payment processors allow for 0-conf as well. And since when has replace by fee been adopted by the majority of the network? Honestly curious about that.

What gets me is they haven't even really done sweet fuck all, just said a lot of stuff and burned through their entire crowd fund. They ran a few pretty meh fundraisers for some other random projects, the most interesting of which was a friggin comic book..
And then there was the bitcoin foundation election which they totally screwed up... Using "swarm technology" but really all they did was use the already existing functionality in counterparty (which they didn't build) to issue a few tokens, and then sent people over to counterwallet (which they also did not build or help build) to go through a crappy voting process. I'm still not sure what "tech" they have actually built other than a flashy website that takes you through 4 different redirects into the latest splash page.

Kind of. Although I dont really think it would be that much on the side network to accomodate 2 currency/transaction types... mostly just brainstorming here. Tricky problem for sure, creating the right balance of incentives..
I think a good example would be a potential implementation of Counterparty into a sidechain. If you dont know already, counterparty is another project like mastercoin, colored coins etc., and out in the wild already which is cool. It currently runs on top of the bitcoin blockchain, and also has its own secondary unit. So there is regular BTC, and then XCP.
XCP is required to perform certian actions in the protocol such as creating a digital asset, issuing new shares etc.. It gets its value from these abilities. BTC on the other hand is used to purchase XCP, or purchase shares of other assets (technically can use xcp for this as well though). The BTC inputs/outputs also are where the data for asset ownership, shares etc. are stored.
The main limiting factor with counterparty is a) you cant store that much data in a bitcoin transaction, and b) you need to wait for confirmations in order to do anything, So if the whole system was moved to a side-chain, you could be able to store much more data in each transaction and have very quick (~ 30 seconds) confirmation times. The only problem with this though is that currently all XCP has been created via a "burn" process (basically send bitcoin to a provably unspendable address, get XCP back). So it would have to be re-implemented into some sort of mining reward instead.

that is the most retarded thing I have seen you say in this thread so far. congrats. Are we calling anything that takes money from lots of people "distributed" now?
I actively have been using bitcoin almost every single day since mid 2012. It is extremely rare for any transaction I have ever made to ever take longer than 1 or 2 blocks to confirm. There has never been a single time that my transactions have taken longer than a couple seconds to fully propagate (or enough to show on blockchain.info anyway). Nobodies service is being denied or delayed in any way by satoshi dice transactions, stop making shit up.

@_date: 2014-04-02 15:35:43
was a great business idea but looks like they are pretty much done for, such a shame... Losing a shit ton of BTC between BitFunder and MtGox, then the CEO calls it quits and takes off because of "death threats" towards his family? Like ya I get it, death threats are pretty bad, but this is also the internet and its pretty much to be expected that if you become well known online your probably going to get some death threats, but 99.99% of those arnt going to go through with it, people just like to talk shit. 
Just another tough lesson to NEVER hold bitcoins in an exchange.. any of them could go under at any moment. Put bitcoins in, make your trades, take bitcoins out as soon as possible. Not that hard really. And if your business model relies on being able to make quick trades and play the market, then FFS keep an offline/secure BTC reserve that could easily cover any potential losses if your exchange account got hacked or exchange got shut down or something.

Your ignoring a major part of the problem which is transaction propagation. If transactions are only relayed if they pay high enough fees, then anything under those fees will rarely get relayed and take forever to get mined (or just get dropped/rejected completely). That is how it works now and it works pretty good, because it's at reasonable levels. 
The problem comes in when the amount of new transactions generated greatly outweighs the rate that they are being confirmed, which means you are going to get a huge back log no matter what. If miners want to cut down on their mempool, then they will increase the fees necessary for them to accept a transaction, which again is fine... but if there is high enough pressure to keep increasing those fees, your going to end up in a situation where every transaction has to pay ridiculous fees in order for anyone to mine them, and everyone else won't even have their transaction relayed, or just get stuck in the mempool until it gets dropped. At which point most people will just get too frustrated and quit, plus one of the major selling points ("low fees") will now be a lie..

OP's title is misleading yes, but you are wrong to say that anyone at counterparty has been bragging about it (except for the first time when they were like "hey look, we just ported the ethereum code over!"). Garzik is not involved in counterparty at all AFAIK. Maybe I missed it, but I am on most of the chat rooms and forums where the XCP devs and other people doing stuff with counterparty hang out... I have never seen anyone go around boasting about it and shitting on the ethereum team in the way that you are claiming right now. In fact, last I heard, XCP devs and Ethereum devs have been working together  (not sure on the specifics though). 
You can also say the same thing about pretty much every alt-coin out there. Plus there is Viacoin, which is yet another bitcoin/litecoin fork, but with the addition of a fork of counterparty itself adapted to their coin, which they have renamed to the "clearinghouse protocol", claiming it is theirs and then raised over 600BTC selling pre-mined coins for this. And yet the XCP team did not raise any money at all (opposite actually, they burned their own funds for it) for the protocol which they to have spent hundreds of hours building... only to have some dude copy it and make a bunch of money for himself. At least when the XCP team did the ethereum fork they didn't try and do some shitty fundraiser for it.

@_date: 2014-11-15 11:28:49


Fair enough, sorry for the assumptions. A lot has changed in 10 years though


Wordpress is the epitome of a badly designed PHP web app. bad example... So because WordPress and some other high profile PHP projects suck, therefore you cant make good forum software using PHP?
What do you think of things such as Composer and Laravel?


Replace PHP in that statement with any other programming language and it applies the same. Finding somebody who is a total ninja with programming and knows their main language inside and out and makes no mistakes... that is very rare, and those types of people can usually display such proficiency in most languages (most programming languages are very similar, just different syntax)


Sort of yeah. Your "average, typical" PHP dev is pretty crappy to be honest. That is just because PHP is one of the easiest to learn and start out with, the most widely supported and you can get away with having pretty loose standards. A 14 year old kid can jump head first into PHP as their first language, but you dont really see that often with other languages like Ruby and Python. If Python was extremely easy for newbs to deploy, almost universally supported and the go-to language for newbie web devs to start with, you would probably see something pretty similar (objectively though, PHP isnt the most well designed)
main point: there is no reason you cant create a solid web app using PHP. Can you specifically cite PHP issues which result in a "good" PHP based forum being "just not feasible"?  
Other than the fact that there is less of a % of skilled developers.  
*edit*: additonally, looking into the "plone" example you give (never heard of it in all my years...). Clunky site, riddled with broken images. Apparantly widely used by governments, non profits, museums etc.. (most of which are usually very low traffic BTW, and from my experience software marketed towards the public sector is usually absolutely shit). The comparison you give is only between the relatively completely unknown "Plone" and the top 3 PHP based content management systems which consist of a very significant percentage of the web and millions upon millions of users. Seems like cherry picking to me, would be nice to see comparisons to other systems

1MB is the max it can be right now, it is usually way less then that. It's only ever going to get to 20MB if we start having over 20 times the usage on the network that we do today. Which would be a good thing because it means we are growing.

if you have the know how to setup a bitcoind server, just do it yourself. pretty easy, something like this:
* bitcoin-&gt;getnewaddress(some_account_identifier) - gets a new address for the customer
* make a script that checks for new transactions every 30 seconds or something. call bitcoin-&gt;listtransactions(account_identifier), loop through and check for total amounts received, confirmations etc. (here it where you would decide if you want to accept 0-conf or not)
* if enough coin is received, mark payment complete, record transaction IDs and do whatever else. done

@_date: 2015-05-04 23:23:11
What issues specifically do you see that are being put off and ignored?
If the block size isn't increased but transactions do increase, the mempool grows larger in size and each node either has to ramp up the amount of memory etc. they have available, or decide to start dropping most transactions. In the former case, the cost to run a full node goes way up (for e.g renting out a 6GB or 8GB VPS is more expensive then renting one with only 2 or 4 GB or RAM... disk space however is cheap), which of course further reduces the amount of people willing to run a full node, and thus lowers our decentralization. In the latter case, the simple act of sending a transaction becomes much less reliable, you don't know if it's going to get randomly dropped by everyone and cause you to have to resend it, or even get propagated at all. And without full network propagation there is an even less chance that your TX will make it into the next block found. Is there something I've got wrong or something else I'm missing?
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:13:19
Yeah, I got carried away after the first couple paragraphs, whoops

Its mostly about general safe computing practices. Be careful where you give your personal info out, don't click those random links in your email or open that random .exe file you accidently downloaded. Use decently secure passwords, use 2FA when available, make sure the site you are on is really what you think it is, etc... And of course if something sounds too good to be true it almost always is.
A lot of people seem to think that you can just get a virus  or get hacked at random at any point in time, but it doesn't really work like that. Its usually a screw up by the user, such as installing something which they should know better, falling for a phishing scam or having everything important on their email but with a weak password. 
Actually pay attention to what you are doing, be smart about it and you should be fine.
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:46:36
Nodes constantly clearing out their mempools will mean that there will be many cases where transactions simply get dropped by the network entirely. All of a sudden bitcoin transactions become unreliable, because you don't even know if it will get dropped and need to be sent again. 
As for replace by fee, you think people are going to just love the fact that they constantly have to re-send their transactions with increasingly higher fees? My best is that they just won't use bitcoin, because at that point there is better alternatives. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:26:15


Nope, pretty much nobody does this. There is a handful of alternatives to bitcoin core, such as bitcoinj and bit-core, and I think a few others.

if you deposit the bitcoin you want to trade with at the begining of the day, and take it out when you are done for the day then this isnt an issue.

If the concern is just "we don't want too many options on the screen", they could just consolidate and simplify the options they already have, pretty trivial. It could easily be just 2 things to click on + 3 buttons for different ways to pay, instead of 10 things to click on and 2 payment buttons.

Your title makes it sound like you are saying that Koinify used  $200,000 of their own VC funds they have received to just straight up give to the Gems project after a so called "tiny" goal.... What actually has happened is that Gems raised a ton of BTC from the public via crowdsale, and Koinify is only going to release 50% of it to them once they have released an actual working MVP or prototype. That 50% of the  money that *Gems* raised happens to be worth about $200K at this time. Which BTW is not even that much money, thats about enough to pay a few full time programmers for maybe a year. 
Like others have said, literally every single other crowdsale that has ever happened in this space, the developers/project get **100%** of the funds immediately, which means they could just fuck off without even releasing a single line of code. 
Also where are you getting the 5% figure from?

In a way it makes sense only in the case of severe block space scarcity, but I think in practice most real people are just going to hate it. People are impatient and also cheap, and they don't like it when they have to repeat a task more than once in order for it to work. Gavin also makes a good point with hardware and multisig wallets, they would make this process even more frustrating (also good luck having it implemented across every single wallet). 
Imagine you have an important business deal to make, you get together your 3 other co-signers (who may be located in various timezones), get out your hardware wallets, sign a transaction and send it off. The problem of the mempool being saturated still wouldn't be solved, so unless they explicitly paid a super high transaction fee, the TX might not go through for some time or get stuck, causing you and your multisig crew to have to organize the entire process yet again. Sounds like a major pain in the ass, and definitely not a cryptocurrency that I would want to use with my business.

lmao, ok then. I think you missed this part:


That's not fud, that's an obvious situation if bitcoin keeps growing but always keeps the 1 MB limit. Do you know what transaction propagation is? Simply setting it so you don't relay transactions that pay too low a fee is still not going to matter if there are hundreds of thousands of people willing to pay those higher fees. I guess if everyone keeps constantly raising the fees required to relay, then the problem will sort of solve itself due to people not even wanting to use the blockchain because it is slow and expensive as hell, but to me that is like arguing that the bitcoin experiment should just end in a few years, game over, pack 'er up boys..

"mempool" (memory pool) is the list of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included in an upcoming block.

For storage space, in addition to pruning you also have the fact that you can get a 1TB HDD right now for under $100 which can hold 8 or 9X the current entire blockchain. If you don't mind the annoyance of filling up an entire hard drive with one thing, pretty low barrier to entry still and storage costs keep coming down.
The bigger problem is bandwidth (which BTW excessive mempool backlogs are also major bandwidth hogs because of rebroadcasting etc.). Even that though can be mitigated by things like data compression, personal bandwidth limiting options and others.

Greg can you point out where Oliver claims bitcoin is "controlled" by the Bitcoin Foundation? I don't think anyone has made that claim ever. 
As for the quote about "pillars of bitcoin" that you quote, that is super non controversial basic bitcoin 101 stuff. You telling me you don't agree with the 21 million supply limit, decentralization or anonymity? 
Your also quoting something from shortly after Blockstream was publicly announced, when it was still assumed that the Bitcoin Foundation was the primary funding source for Core devs (which it was, even if not much).

The point your missing is that broadcasting to a specific miner is in no way lending them any sort of meaningful support or actually rewarding them. They might be the first to see it so technically they have the first chance to mine it, but it is extremely likely that most mining pools (if not all) are not keeping transactions secret from each other, they would treat it like any other and simply relay it if it didn't make it into their block. Endless amount of transactions to choose from with blocks always full like this. Unless you are also paying ludicrous fees on that tx they have zero incentive to keep it for themselves.

Don't think you can do it from right in the electrum wallet no. I think they have RBF (replace-by-fee) feature now for some servers, but your transaction is already in-flight so it's too late for that.

sure. If you use 0-conf transactions properly, there is no problem. All they need to do is watch for the double spend, and then if it happens, send a notification to the merchant (either via API or actually contact them), letting them know that their customer just tried to double spend them, and then they can take whatever action is necessary after that. 
For example, say I want to have a physical product shipped to me. I pay in BTC, then double spend that in an attempt to screw the merchant over and get a free thing. Coinbase could then notify the merchant, who will then be like "hey, we detected a double spend so we are not going to send you your product unless you pay for real". Another example could be a service where you have to pay a registration fee or are able to buy a premium account... "oh, you double spent that, guess who's account just got suspended?".
Any situation where there is a possibility of you getting scammed with a 0-conf double spend and nothing you would be able to do about it... just friggin make them wait for the 1 confirmation or so then. Nobody has to lose any money if implemented responsibly.
If Coinbase is not notifying their clients of double spend attempts and just eating the loss, then yeah I could see how they would be losing some money. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 15:44:18
This is just silly. Do you have any numbers on what it would take to make running a full node "economically impossible"? I have 4TB per month in bandwidth just with a $40 server, which is many many times more than what a full node uses today, and they keep throwing more bandwidth at me for a cheaper rate over the years. As for disk space, for less than $100 I can fit the entire blockchain nearly 10X over. 
Also there is WAY more to decentralization of the bitcoin network than just full node counts.

Not all wallets. Not all exchanges. Not all pieces of software requiring custom programming. ONLY NODES. Which is like a 10 minute process. What don't you understand about that?


Well they don't, so what's your point? They do detect hard forks however.


Discussion has been going on about this for over 2 years, you have to live in cave (with no wifi) to still be clueless about what is going on. IMO it can be done in a few months notice. Mark July 1st 2017 on your calendar. 


Cool, so am I. Doing a simple server upgrade is far.. FAR simpler than waiting on custom programming for all your platforms and pieces of infrastructure to handle and generate the new transaction format. Companies do routine server upgrades all the time. Also legacy companies are not running nodes. 


No, you are forgetting **yet again** what is involved with an "effective block size increase" via segwit. Re-read my previous comments again. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 17:41:08


Yeah, just like Litecoin doesn't have a scaling problem (blocks are regularly under 10KB and no more than 25 transactions).. they also don't have an active malleability problem. Hell, malleability isn't even a common real-world problem in Bitcoin either. While it could happen and thus you techically can't 100% trust any tx ids until they are confirmed, in practice this almost never happens. The only time I can think of that it became an issue was when somebody was running some nodes that purposefully malleated and then re-broadcasted transactions, which caused some havoc for a few weeks. That vector has since been closed by node signature variation enforcement.
If Litecoin was serious about solving TX malleability, they would do it via a hardfork that applies to all possible network transactions, instead of making their already barely developed ecosystem use a kludgly new tx format.

I think that would be the best way to go as well. Have a dynamic limit which auto adjusts every X amount of blocks, based on the average transactions per day. It can be set up in such a way to maintain roughly the same dynamics that the network has right now, which has been working out fairly well. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 22:50:32
It seems like the main problem is really mempool saturation, not the disk space usage and increasing blockchain size. Having a highly competitive TX fee market would just hugely inflate the mempool, which means that either transactions are going to need to be outright dropped (making even sending a transaction not that reliable...), or everyone with full nodes is going to have to seriously beef up the amount of RAM and resources available + bandwidth used, which is going to increase the cost of running a node even more, making the declining amount of full nodes even worse. Disk space is much cheaper than memory. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 23:36:30
I wonder though, is merged mining actually neccesary? all that really matters is the 1:1 bitcoin - sidechain peg. From what I understand, miners wouldnt be comparing blockchains or making sure the right mining algorthim is being used by the alt or anything. merged mining would just be a relatively easy way to bootstrap the sidechain. The actual side-chain mechanism would just be another protocol to follow for locking/freezing an existing amount of BTC, and using that lock to transfer the equivalent amount into the sidechain, and vice versa. Why couldnt that alt be mined with scrypt but still follow the side-chain transfer protocol?

I think it's becoming more common to run full nodes purely for business purposes rather than as your regular wallet or "charity to the network". Personally, all my wallets that I actually frequently use are things like Electrum, Mycelium etc., but at the same I have a few full nodes set up that I use for my business. Unless you want to purely rely on services like blockchain.info, you need a copy of the blockchain yourself if you want to do cool things with the blockchain.

I don't think there is any actual risk of running nodes on consumer hardware getting priced out. You can already store the entire blockchain several times over on a &lt; $100 HDD, plus there is pruning. And if bandwidth is a concern, it's certainly possible to minimize and limit your usage. You might not be able to run a super node on your PC that serves thousands of SPV wallets, but it shouldn't be an issue to get something up for personal or even basic business usage.

That's what happens when you are a purely crypto to crypto exchange and you try and implement some hardcore KYC trying to appease the feds and avoid "trouble". They were doing pretty good (relatively) for a while there, but the moment they changed it so you have to have a verified account in order to deposit, withdraw or do any trading... Their volume went right into the toilet.
Melotic was one of the first exchanges to accept ltbcoin (our rewards program gimick over at let's talk bitcoin). A pretty large number of our users are from Indonesia and many other non western/north american countries, and all of em were using melotic. Once KYC/AML stuff was introduced there was pretty much a collective "nope" from everyone on the forums.

8X the current network activity is a pretty good problem to have and probably means a much higher BTC price. It will be worth it IMO.
Besides, right from the very beginning the entire premise of the blockchain has been an infinitely growing database of P2P cash transactions. Not everyone can handle continuous growth forever, but not everyone needs to either. Plus there is pruning mode available, which allows you to e.g only store the last 20GB of the chain or w/e you set it to.

That's actually the opposite of what happens. Disk space is cheap, and if the block size limit isn't increased, it just means there becomes a massive amount of unconfirmed transactions all the time. Unconfirmed transactions are stored in the "mempool", AKA your RAM (which is expensive) and also unconfirmed transactions are broadcasted repeatedly, eating up extra bandwidth.

Fair points re: witness data.


If you think that bandwidth and disk space are pretty much capped out and we won't be seeing any tech improvements or reduction in cost over the next 10 years, then sure.... we can agree to disagree there. However even today's technology could easily handle 143MB blocks, which is around 76 million transactions per day. It would definitely out-price your individual node operators and some small businesses, but if we are at the point where 10's of millions of tx's are happening daily, pretty good problem to have IMHO. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:46:32
Nope, that's where you are misunderstanding yet again. 
For one, malleability and transaction capacity are entirely separate issues. It's pretty annoying honestly that segwit has mixed the two together which makes these arguments go around in circles.
IMHO, if you are going to make a big deal about fixing malleability, figure out a way to fix it for all transaction types on the network, instead of just one. Yeah it will probably require all software to upgrade, maybe even moreso than segwit. BUT it's not even a pressing issue and can be planned well in advance. Perhaps with one of those wish-list/clean-up hard forks that are sometimes talked about.
The priority is the capacity problem. Remember, entirely different from malleability.
For the capacity problem in regards to the point "if every piece of software upgrades."... this is the basic logic:
Full effect of soft fork segwit (assuming everyone "opts in"):
* All nodes must upgrade, else lose awareness of what is happening on the network and no longer 100% validating the chain
* All wallets must upgrade
* All exchanges, payment processors, and the hundreds/thousands of sites and services that use BTC must upgrade, generally involving custom programming.
* Unless wallets force users into using the new format (unlikely), users will have to manually choose to use SW over traditional style.
Full effect of a block size hard fork:
* All nodes must upgrade, else be left behind. The difference here is that nodes immediately know that they are left behind and need to upgrade ASAP. Whereas with soft fork they are left in the dark.
* That's it.
Clearly the second option makes more sense **for the capacity problem**. 
Again, don't forget that the vast majority of bitcoin node operators are either miners, bitcoin businesses or developers. I.e people actively paying attention. Meanwhile the vast majority of bitcoin users which massively outnumbers node operators, they do not need to do anything other than maybe hang tight for a few hours on fork day. 
Also again, capacity is a more pressing issue (with pressure that keeps building) as opposed to malleability which is the opposite. 
The only argument against hard forking is "what about the nodes that get left behind"? To which I say so what? They might suffer a temporary service disruption for being lazy or not paying attention, then they will quickly figure it out and be able to pick up where they left off. Wow that is so scary! Chances are they weren't doing much anyway.

The conversation about lightning networks is also kicking the can down the road because it is not even close to existing, and none of you have any idea of the problems that will come up when put into practice in the real world. All you have is a white paper and a PDF. Meanwhile Gavin has an actual patch created, tested and waiting to be merged which essentially makes sure that things remain "business as usual" over the next few years in order to give us time to come up with better solutions. Why don't you guys implement lightning network into an altcoin and prove it works? Until then it's about as useful to us as sidechains have been, I.e not at all.

I get your point, but to add to that.. you can encrypt your server so even with physical access, they can't get into it (or maybe they can with some crazy FBI/NSA stuff). At home your ISP could shut down any bitcoin related traffic, or TOR if you try using that instead. So could your server provider as well I suppose. 


Yeah monopolies are ripping people off big time unfortunately!
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:44:20
The point is you don't actually need to write software that way. At my company we actually look at the inputs/outputs of every transaction seen and give it a unique non-malleable ID, which makes it easy to detect any duplicate transactions. Once you get to 2 or more confirmations it's generally perfectly safe to reference the standard TXID instead (which you need to do for creating subsequent transactions anyway). 
The main problem in practice with malleability is when you are "chaining"  several unconfirmed transactions together, all based on the previous unconfirmed txid. If one of the txid's gets changed at any point (e.g some confirm but some high in the chain don't, and someone with a malicious node - a problem now fixed - could have caused a different txid to confirm), the rest of the chain breaks and you simply just have to re-send. So it's mostly an annoyance rather than a really big problem. You can do unconfirmed transaction chaining right now and not have this be an issue 99% of the time. You can also mitigate this problem quite easily by preparing ("priming") the exact number of UTXOs you need beforehand. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:29:35


No, but we are talking about a future where there can be millions of transactions per day, not the 100,000 currently or 50,000 (or whatever it was) around when satoshi dice was big. The soft limit might have been hit, but it never got to any extreme levels where there was a huge transaction back-log and relatively few people could get any confirmations.

Sync time is part of the problem. A bigger part of the problem IMHO is that Bitcoin-QT is the only full node wallet option and compared to almost every other wallet out there, it's complete garbage. Get some more options and better &amp; more user friendly full node wallet software and you will see more people using them. No matter what though, it's always going to be inconvenient to run your own node 24/7 or having to wait to catch up and sync with the chain every time you want to do something.

If we are going to get into such obscure edge cases  as pre-signing an entire chain of unconfirmed transactions and holding on to them for several months or years - sorry but at that point I no longer care, those people (if they even exist, so far it's just hypothetical) can re-generate the txs if they need to. If they set themselves up so that they would lose funds if one of their multi-chained unconfirmed unbroadcasted transactions invalidates (I don't see how that would be possible anyway), they are morons.

It sounds like you don't know very many real people that torrent.. I know that me and many others can't really afford to drop 60 or 70 bucks on the latest video game, or 10 bucks to watch a movie, or a dollar per song or whatever else. Does that mean we shouldn't have access to content and media? Maybe... But the internet is a thing,and it gives us free alternatives, so that's just how it is. You can't fight it, only adapt your business model.
What about people in other parts of the world that have internet access, but due to regional restrictions or payment/economic restrictions literaly can not pay for content even if they wanted to and could afford it? Are they all theives?
What about trying something before you buy it, so that you can be sure you are not about to waste money on something that turns out to be crap? Are they thieves, or just cautious customers?
What about all the artists, shows, documentaries etc. Which have become widely known and succesful, largely due to being able to download them for free from anywhere in the world? For example, there is soo much metal music (and other genres as well) that I simply would never have discovered if it were not for file sharing sites, and many of them would likely remain in obscurity in their local towns/regions. And guess what? If I like them enough, I'll buy some merchandise, or get a hard copy of the album, or get tickets to a concert etc... And if nothing else, I will at least try and spread the word about this awesome new music I found, earning them more fans.
What about something like Photoshop, where if it wasn't for file sharing, probably would not be nearly as huge as it is today? Most graphic designers out there get their start by getting a pirated photoshop copy, not by dropping 600 bucks on the license (way cheaper now I think, but it wasn't for a really long time). Some of those same people then go on to become professionals and fork out the cash for the legitimate product.
What about the countless amount of kids and teenagers out there who have little to no money or income, no access to credit cards, age restrictions on services etc... Are they thieves to, or just curious kids?
Again, have you actually seen any decline in your income directly due to piracy/file sharing, or are you just butthurt about the "principles" of it? I would be interested in seeing some real numbers and explanations other than just "you didn't become a paying customer, therefore you are a thief". In your specific case of stock footage and photos... Pretty much nobody besides other businesses and content creators gives a damn about that (who the heck just browses and randomly buys stock photos to add to their personal photo collection? Or is that a thing..?), so I don't see how piracy is a huge deal there. Businesses that actually do pirate that kind of stuff are shady (or have no money) and would just find something else that's free if they can't get yours
And for the record, I'm not really a content creator, but I do develop open source software. The fact that someone out there will inevitably use things I have created without paying me first is built right into the business model. It just means I have to remain the best, have the best support etc. to stay in business, rather then try and enforce a monopoly.

Yes, you can stuff extra data into your transactions for practically free now, which can result in a block almost 2MB in size or more. You are missing the point though that the size of the blocks is not relevant.. it's how many transactions it can hold. 
How many transactions functionally identical to this can SW blocks hold? 
Hint: not a whole lot more. Even a 50% increase is pathetic anyway. The kick-the-can-down-the-road solution was twice that and proposed over a year ago. Too little too late I'm afraid.


Layer 2 does not exist right now in any usable form. Frankly I just do not care about catering to things that no one is using. 


You got any numbers to back that up? How many TPS would bitcoin have to handle before it's "economically impossible" (as another user in this thread put it) to run a node as an individual?

@_date: 2015-05-31 18:58:48
That's not quite how it would work.
With Gavin's proposal, once 80% of the known network (nodes that you are connected to) is specifically stating they support the version which supports larger block limits, and when the first &gt; 1 MB block is mined, then the fork will happen. At that point you simply won't be connected to that 20% of the network anymore and would not interact with them at all (or alternatively, ONLY be connected to that 20% if using a wallet that doesn't go along with the change). 
In order to do the whole sending on both chains at once thing, you would need to run both an older, 1MB limit node as well as  a 21MB limit (or whatever) node at the same time and load the same private keys into them. You could then make transactions to both chains... HOWEVER, if a majority of the hashing power is already on the new fork, then that 20% of the network not adopting it is going to grind to a halt pretty quick due to the huge mining difficulty that would be leftover. In order for the 1MB chain to survive such a huge hashpower drop, it would probably need to be forked yet again to force the difficulty down to a reasonable level for the remaining miners.
Realistically, maybe a small handful of people will even take the time to attempt to do that. Not going to matter a whole lot anyways when all the major exchanges and payment processors are already on board and there isn't anywhere to cash out pre-fork coins.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:35:19

I agree. I don't really get the mindset of a lot of people in times like this. What, did you honestly think the price would only ever go up forever? Or that during a price drop, everyone is just going to call it quits, game over, no more bitcoin? For me, I dont look at my stash and think "I have 600$... Oh wait now 630... Now 500" , I just think "I have 1 BTC.".  Unless I'm actively looking to cash out or spend a lot on something priced in dollars, the price is totally irrelevant. If anything makes me much less likely to sell

The vast majority of users are not going to bother going through all the hassle of setting up multiple bitcoin nodes just so they can try and use their coins twice. It's not like they could use them twice in the same places. pre-fork coins would only work on services which also have not adopted the new fork. I guess if you want to waste some time on MPEX, then yeah might be a good idea to keep access to the old chain...
Again, the fork only happens once the network already has 80% version consensus. 
IMO the BTC exchanges have the final say in this. Miners (and everyone else for that matter) are only going to follow the chain which they can actually get money out of. All those BTC they are mining would not be very useful if there is no where they can sell them to. Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, BTC-E, Bitfinex, Cavirtex, OKCoin and Local Bitcoins are pretty much the only real players that need convincing. Coinbase and OKCoin have [both already publicly stated their support]( for the block size increase. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:29:42
Or if people would get on board with solving the block size problem, fees could stay average &lt; $0.50 each the whole time while you get to make as many transactions as you need. Why do fees per tx need to constantly go up when miners are perfectly capable of handling many times more? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 20:30:12
If you knew what you were talking about you would know that it's not the block size that matters, it's the number of transactions. What is the max number of basic transactions similar to the one I linked to that can fit in segwit? Yes it's slightly more (assuming 100% SW txs), but it's pitiful. 


Pushing segwit as what everyone should start using instead of regular transactions contradicts this statement.

Keep taking peoples ids, trust me . I use to sell on LocalBitcoins using e-transfers. Didn't bother verifying anyone until one day my bank account got frozen for 2 weeks and lost out on a couple hundred bucks plus couple hundred in btc all because one of the guys I sold to called up the bank and said it was a fraud transaction. The bank wouldn't accept my proof or explanation and wouldn't even try to talk to the scammer. To this day I can't even accept e-transfers anymore because of it. Any transaction I try to make or receive gets blocked instantly and held up by the bank for several days. And after spending hours upon hours and talking to over 12 people between interac and 2 different banks, they still won't get rid of the instant block tied to my identity. Apparently my only chance is to make an appointment with the head manager at the main bank branch in town. And of course they only make their own appointments and good luck catching them when you work 9 to 5 all week.

actually I think it would be easier to audit. You would just have to register your public keys with the government or something.

@_date: 2017-02-17 15:26:16


No, that's not what I mean. Look up Low-S versus High-S signatures. Basically one of the primary "malleability vectors" is that it is possible to slightly tweak a transaction so that it results in a different transaction ID but still a valid signature and otherwise same transaction. You can do this without needing their private key or anything. Sometime last year IIRC someone was running nodes that did exactly this, and it screwed with anyone relying on unconfirmed TXIDs for anything. All modern node versions now contain enforcement of High-S (or maybe low - one of the two) signatures, meaning that nodes will no longer relay the slightly altered variation. Now this vector is no longer a problem, which is the fix I mentioned.


Yeah you will have to get online again to re-sign those transactions. Unless they are time sensitive though you probably don't need to actively be monitoring the whole time, just do it whenever you notice and get around to it. And again, thanks to the fix above that I mentioned, this is barely even a real world issue anymore.
Funny thing is though what you just described is exactly one of the major problems with Lightning Network. For that, you really do have to be online at all times monitoring everything, keys decrypted ready to automatically sign at a moments notice to constantly rebalance channels. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:04:16


So, you think that transaction volume will increase 20 fold the moment the limit is increased to 20MB? Also, didn't Gavin run some tests a while ago (before this debate got heated) that showed that bitcoin core can easily handle 20MB blocks without any major problems? found it actually: 
I also run multiple full nodes, and I for one am not concerned in the slightest that I won't be able to run a node anymore (oh no.. might possibly have to pay an extra 10 bucks for a little more powerful server!). I have yet to talk to any node operators or bitcoin businesses in general that share the same concern you do of nodes being immediately too costly to run for everyone.

The closest I have seen you answer that is saying we should increase by 1 MB per year instead of jumping to 20.

"Customers have every incentive to upgrade" is a total myth. I posted about this recently in another comment, but here it is again:
Lower fees are not very much of an incentive when "lower" is still (or quickly becomes) equal or greater than fee levels of say 6 months or so ago. Any increase in capacity (actual # of transactions confirmed, which btw segwit barely improves if at all) will be barely noticeable for quite some time, and in reality the network conditions will still be the same with increasingly larger and more frequent backlogs. An extra 0.5MB or w/e of transactions barely makes a dent. For miners, I don't see how there is much incentive to mine transactions that pay lower fees than everyone else yet can use much more disk space and bandwidth. As a user that makes his entire living off BTC, I don't particularly want to move and start putting all my funds into a brand new experimental transaction type. Similarly how I wouldn't have 100% switched to P2SH when it was released and activated. As a developer and owner of a bitcoin focused business, I don't want to spend the time and money upgrading all my custom platforms etc. to construct only segwit transactions until I absolutely have to or anything non-segwit becomes completely impractical. I'd rather spend my time building cool new features. Doubling on-chain capacity should be as simple as just taking 10 minutes to upgrade your node, shouldn't have to go re-program everywhere you are generating transactions.
So from my perspective it's pretty much the opposite. There is every reason for the segwit "incentives" to **not** make the results happen quickly. We can see this already with it still not being activated 4 months later and stuck at 25%. (cue downvotes..)

Fair enough. The upper limit on block sizes has never been a factor though, so why bother with it? How is it as fundamental as the 21M limit?
Further centralization due to larger costs to run a node (more disk space and bandwidth) is often brought up, but it seems to me that *not* increasing the block size limit would actually make it even more expensive to run a node, due to needing a larger amount of RAM (way more expensive than disk space) to handle the much larger mempool. You could limit the mempool size, but then you just run into propagation issues if bitcoin gets too popular.

Actually it's every 2016 blocks (roughly 2 weeks) that the difficulty changes, but yes. The 50,000 number I suggested (pulled from my ass) would have the block limit changing about once per year, which seems reasonable to me. A lot can happen in one year.

@_date: 2015-05-08 17:05:04
It could keep the same dynamics that we have in place now. I'm not sure how full the average block is, but say each block is on average 50% full (so about 500KB), there is 100,000 transactions per day, and the mempool is holding at most 5% of the days transaction volume. What does the block limit need to adjust to in order for blocks to still be an average 50% full and mempool to stay within 5%, when there is a million or a hundred million transactions per day?
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:55:50


Transaction queues are stored in something called the "mempool", which is stored in your nodes RAM. The more transactions in the queue, the more RAM is being used. I've run several full nodes and I have often had issues keeping the bitcoin server stable and not crashing due to running out of available memory, and that's just with how it is currently. RAM is wayyy more expensive than disk space. The transaction queue right now usually stays under 5,000 transactions. If bitcoin takes off and the block size limit is still so tiny, the number of pending transactions could be in the hundreds of thousands or more. If that's all in the mempool, I might need to pay a few hundred bucks per month or more to pay for a server with that much RAM, as opposed to the 10 or 20 bucks I pay now. Mempool transactions are also re-broadcasted to the network frequently, so your just multiplying your bandwidth usage the longer they stay unconfirmed.
So much for decentralization right? And that's not even to mention that it would be completely impossible for every transaction to be confirmed (unless no new transactions get created because everyone gave up on bitcoin). Why even bother sending a transaction if it's probably never going to get confirmed? A larger block size limit will make sure the mempool never gets too large.
One alternative I guess would be to store the mempool on disk instead of RAM, but that is a lot slower and at that point you mise well just commit them right into the blockchain... and we already have blockchain pruning as of recently, so the argument about ever increasing blockchain size is moot.
Another alternative is for each node to be very strict on what transactions they will actually relay, maybe only accepting up to 10,000 transactions in their mempool or something (and most likely ordered by fee). This leads to an even worse situation because now unless you are in the top 10,000 transactions in terms of paying fees (out of say, half a million or more pending transactions), your transaction *won't even be propagated* around the network, and might not ever confirm or be seen by anyone besides your local wallet. Here's an example: last night I was screwing around a bit, and sent out a transaction that was under that standard "dust size limit" of 5500 satoshis (the lowest value most nodes/miners will relay and confirm). The transaction appeared to send successfully, however here I am over 12 hours later with no confirmations and not even showing up on blockchain.info or anything, all because most nodes are configured to ignore transactions of that low value (even though I paid a normal sized fee, just too small of outputs). Now I have to manually clear out those transactions from my wallet and try again with higher outputs. It's not hard to imagine how it would be bad if something like that was a very common occurrence.

@_date: 2015-05-31 23:49:19
sometime last year, made another typical alt-coin named Viacoin, but with the addition of also forking Counterparty and renaming it the "Clearinghouse protocol". One of the main motivations cited for "creating" viacoin+clearinghouse was that the BTC core devs are too resistant to change and also apparantly hostile to certain uses of the blockchain (mostly because OP_RETURN was supposed to allow for 80 bytes of data, but luke-jr slashed it down to 40 and there was a huge fuss about it). So the solution was to take Counterparty, fork it and have it run on a block chain with much shorter confirmation times, which makes the Counterparty decentralized asset exchange less clunky (as opposed to BTC with 10 minute block times).
When Viacoin was launched, they did the whole usual "this is the future of digital currency!" and "we are better and more awesome than bitcoin because reasons" marketing BS that we see all the time. They also did a pretty big pre-mine and raised something like 600+ BTC out of it. One of the first things he did with that money was hire on Peter Todd to specifically develop the "tree chains" concept, which of course never amounted to anything, but now Peter has the title of chief scientist of viacoin, even though he mostly just works on bitcoin core. Hiring him always seemed like a PR stunt more than anything, IMO. 
One of the reasons the whole pre-mine sale seemed shady was that he literally just copy and pasted the code for Counterparty and Counterwallet, changed the name and maybe a couple other variables, played it off as his own protocol (ok not exactly, but sure seemed like it coming from a perspective of somebody who doesn't already know about counterparty), and then just like that received hundreds of BTC. Meanwhile, counterparty raised no money at all, and even burned some of their own funds while bootstrapping it. Now, a year later, AFAIK sweet fuck all is going on with Viacoin and I am sure that most if not all the pre-mine sale funds have been burned through, mostly on Peter. 
There is probably a whole lot more to it that I am missing

That sounds nice, until you have 100,000 unconfirmed transactions with only a few thousand being confirmed at a time, so it would be impossible to come even close to clearing all transactions. Then people will just give up on btc because suddenly it is useless since hardly anyone would be able to get anything confirmed. Dropping transactions from the mempool leads to an even worse situation, half the time just trying to send a transaction would not even be seen by anyone because all mempools are full
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:18:49
Is there a proof of concept of this built, or is it all just notes? That PDF itself says that 133 MB blocks would be needed for unlimited transactions, so why keep it at 1MB? 
Also there are plenty of reasons to have transactions be on-chain, just as there are plenty of reasons to have transactions off-chain. Are you suggesting the bitcoin network should just be purely a clearing house for the lightning network?

No, we do not need a bitcoin version of paypal :p pretty sure CoinBase and Circle cover that niche fairly well, and they have huge amounts of funding to make it happen (feel free to try and compete if you manage to get tens of millions in funding :P )
IMO I wouldnt bother trying to build an exchange/trading platform or wallet, unless you are just contributing to an open source project (such as Darkwallet). Pretty much everyone and their mother is already trying to build one, and most of them fail spectacularly (also, exchanges and web wallets are huge targets for hackers)
Don't really have time to list out various services and potential applications that could be built, but basically anything that could potentially involve money in some form can be built with bitcoin. So I guess it comes down to whatever you find the most interesting or the most worthwhile.

Each node maintains it's own mempool, so even if several have dropped the transaction, you can't know for sure that it was fully dropped everywhere. The originating node also does not drop it (unless you tell it to) and will periodically re-broadcast until confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:09:33
I still don't get the logic of including major features and restructuring into a minor version number, but ok. Bottom line is that it's not a solution to the capacity problem. By the time it gets activated (if at all), by the time individual users adopt it en-masse, any theoretical capacity increase it gives will be entirely negated by natural network growth (which is still growing, even if slowed). It's worse than a kick-the-can down the road solution in that regards. The other aspects of segwit I personally don't care about.

I do not. Indeed at home I pay about the same as you for the same speed, and get about 400GB included per month. Small town in Canada. That is still enough to easily run a node off my PC though, which I have done before. But running a node from home is only useful to me for development/testing purposes. Primary reason to have a node is for business usage, it would be silly (and probably irreseponsible) for me to have my various websites etc. call back to my home connection to create, broadcast and monitor transactions. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:30:14
If there is 100,000 transactions today with a 1 MB limit, and it auto adjusts based on usage, that means with a 500MB limit there should be 50,000,000 transactions per day. I think at that point it's safe to say we are well on our way to global domination and miners will be raking in some pretty decent fees from all that. The exchange rate of BTC will also likely by much larger at that point simply due to the sheer amount of people and money involved and the limited supply. Miners and businesses running full nodes will be able to afford the bandwidth easily. It was never the case that you could be a player off your home PC and internet connection if we are to "succeed" and be used for 10's of millions of transactions per day. 
If enough transactions per day are happening to fill 500MB blocks, your not going to see people here complaining about the block size, your going to see everyone circle jerking about how the system is booming.
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:55:35
I think a major point for this is the lack of credit card fraud. When you use a credit card online (or anywhere really), you always have to worry about wether the site is just going to take and sell your credit and identity info to somebody, or even if they are totally legit, they can still be hacked (see: target) and now a massive amount of personal identity information and usable credit card numbers are out in the wild. Credit security is laughable.
With bitcoin, you wont ever send money to a website and then the next day or week find out that your account has been cleaned out,  spent on someones night out in vegas. It simply doesnt and cant happen.  And then having to deal with the huge hassle of calling up your bank or credit company and trying to get your money back, card cancelled and re-issued etc. But then if your identity has been stolen as well that can be used to continuously fuck with you for a long time. This shit  happens all the time. I personally know alot of people that are extremely weary or even scared of buying things online because there is a massive amount of scams out there and its a real possibility. At least with bitcoin, if the site is a scam you might be out of a little bit of money, but you know the rest of your money is totally safe.
Sure, you can still lose your BTC a number of ways.. leaving a unencrypted backup on your email (awful idea), storing your coin on an exchange or shared web wallet (awful idea) etc. Or if you have malware/keyloggers installed on your computer, you can lose it that way. But if your at the point where your computer is that compromised, your pretty much screwed either way as even if you dont have BTC they would easily be able to get access to credit, bank accounts and all your personal stuff.

Lmao, how about responding to my arguments instead of cherry picking one thing and calling me entitled for that? You act as if I literaly never pay for anything unless I'm forced to. In reality I have spent many thousands of dollars on video games, movies, music, concerts, merchandise etc over the years... But I guess I am entitled because...
* I like to download music to see if I like it first, and tend to support bands directly (when I can) rather than paying money to iTunes or whatever other third party service. Also a lot of music out there is simply very difficult or nearly impossible to find outside file sharing sites.
* I usually download a video game and check it out to see if its actually worth the money, since demos are not really a thing anymore.. There are many "triple A" games out there which I could have dropped hundreds on, but I didn't because I realized I didn't end up liking the game, or worse when the game is just buggy and broken as hell, which is becoming far too common. 
* I download shows because I can't fucking stand commercials and censorship. This is actually pretty rare for me, mostly using Netflix now. Turns out offering a good and convinient service for a fair price is a good way to compete with file sharing.
* I downloaded a pirated version of Photoshop once when I was like 13 years old and used it to teach myself basic image editing and graphic &amp; web design, which is now extremely useful for me in my profession and I have a "legit" copy/license now.
God, are'nt I just the most entitled and horrible person ever? *Such a dirty thief!!*

Do you understand the difference between size of a block, number of transactions processed and fees collected? You are just throwing around meaningless  numbers at this point. 


Duh. Block size hard fork upgrade requires only nodes to upgrade. Segwit soft fork requires nodes to upgrade + every single piece of infrastructure  and every wallet that produces transactions. Do you understand the difference there? One requires more work, is slower to take effect and is a short term scaling solution (hint: it's "soft"). 


Putting words in my mouth. I never said that. If nodes choose to never upgrade and stay in the minority chain that is their prerogative though.  What's contradictory here again? Why are you so afraid of putting a major network change up for consensus? Live a little.
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:57:20

they didnt make anything unless they were sold. you can take any point in time and any amount in BTC and go (price at time X amount of BTC).. but the number is essentially meaningless.

@_date: 2017-02-11 00:45:00
That's not how it works at all. Even if it's activated it's going to be many months before a significant portion of transaction volume is done through segwit because it requires individual user adoption as well. It's highly unlikely every wallet and service will both upgrade immediately and force everyone to use segwit only for txs. I for one am not keen on moving any of my transactions to a new tx format anytime soon. Besides, by the time it is activated and seeing significant usage, the cap will already be hit again very shortly after and we will be in the exact same boat. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 16:35:08

Not trying to argue in bad faith, and I don't assume the same of you. "Practically free" is a hyperbole but it's true that whatever you can stuff into the witness data you pay 75% less for, even though it takes the same amount of space. What's being misrepresented?
I'l ask this one again, so far literally no one has answered me on this:
How many transactions functionally identical to this can SW blocks hold? 


Likewise you should think about the current situation and not just the future unproven technology your banking on. I'm fully aware of the potential of this tech, I'm working on pushing it forward in my own small ways on a daily basis. 


No problem! Here's a simple calculation for how miners can get back to 25 BTC rewards per block just purely from TX volume: 500,000 transactions @ average size of 300 bytes and paying average 5,000 satoshis (much lower than todays fees) = 143MB blocks. That seems excessive today, but in a bit over 10 years from now when the block subsidy approaches less than 1 BTC, I think it's fairly realistic unless all technological progress somehow grinds to a halt. 


Ok sure. If 10X the amount of people start using bitcoin, why wouldn't at least some % of them run nodes, resulting in greater node counts than today's levels? The majority of nodes today are not operated by your average bitcoiner, they are operated by a combination of miners/bitcoin business/developers. Increase the numbers in any of those 3 groups and you will get more nodes.
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:20:42
Most likely yeah. You can put in your transaction ID into a block explorer such as this:  and tell us what the "Fee / KB" value is and we can give you a rough estimate (or you can compare against  ). Too low a fee ratio and it maybe be stuck for some time until this 50K transaction backlog clears up.

Wow, no shit. That's like one of the first things you learn about bitcoin, congratulations.


I've paid $15,000+ in mining fees just over the past few years. Hell, for my personal transactions I often pay well above regular rates just because I can and I like to see certain transactions get confirmed ASAP. How many transactions do you create on a regular basis Frogolcalypse?


LOL. Dude I grew up just barely getting by and never had more than $200 to my name (usually less than $50 or more often just nothing) until my grandparents died and I got a whopping $5000 out of it. Which was sweet for the end of high school but that is like 2 months of bills or less in the real world. Then I worked various jobs, living on my own pay cheque to pay cheque for years until I started doing freelance development and joined in on a startup. Now I make income almost exclusively in BTC, but guess what, still pretty much living month to month. 
I have had sweet fuck all given to me and nothing but set back after set back. Stop assuming you know shit about me just because you consider me a "millennial". 


That's not how it works, and I never said don't charge fees dummy. Fees should be **reasonably** low. Miners make money on processing large tx volume. Lots of people get to use bitcoin because it's cheap. Fees from Tx volume eventually overtakes (and can even exceed) the block reward subsidy. Win win, pretty simple stuff too IMHO.

sort of, although it is more about paying people with counterparty tokens than directly with bitcoin (wouldnt be that hard to make it use pure BTC though). 
On our forums, we do something called "Proof of Participation". Basically the gist of it is that every week, your total daily posts, likes (soon to be replaced by upvote/downvotes) and other site activity etc. are tallied up and turned into a final score. Any posts which get removed as spam or w/e by a moderator give you negative points on your final score. Once a week, an amount of LTBCOIN tokens (on a fixed schedule) gets created and then automatically distributed to members based on their participation scores.  For example, if there were 10 members participating in total, and each got the same participation score of 1,000 points, then each would get 10% of the new tokens issued. 
It's been an interesting gimmick, but has had it's own challenges as well. For instance, at the beginning, it was pretty easy to game the system, so we saw a huge amount of russian and indonesian users (not sure why those 2 groups were so prominent) doing things like making constant 1 or 2 word nonsense posts, farming likes/upvotes among eachother, and also making tons of duplicate accounts for coin farming purposes. We have since introduced various anti-spam measures and have adapted how the reward score calculation works, which has brought the issues down to a pretty decent level, but it can still be tweaked and improved. The trick is figuring out how to keep the reward percentages always in favour of the most valuable and legitimately active users.
A similar set up but using purely BTC would be pretty cool, but the main problem with that is figuring out where that bitcoin is going to come from, need some sort of pool of community funds or way to monetize the site in order to keep payouts flowing, and that would also need to increase with the growth of the forum in general.. people might not have as much of an incentive to participate  if they see the amount of BTC they are getting constantly going down. With the LTBCOIN token, we can create as much of it as we want for basically free... but then it only has any sort of value if the community/network has value, which can be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it.

The whole no-fee argument is just retarded, I dont think nullc has ever tried to create a transaction with embedded data and multisig outputs that are &lt; 0.01 and with no fee... because it would either get rejected by nodes or if not, take a stupid long time to confirm. &gt;_&lt;

It took me less than 5 minutes to setup my main wallet (download electrum -&gt; install -&gt; write down what it tells you to write down -&gt; choose a password). I have sent and received transactions from it almost every single day for the past 2 years. Not once has anything been stolen from me or private keys compromised etc.. in fact thanks to the seed that it made me write down, my coins have been saved multiple times from computer crashes etc.
It's actually incredibly easy to have a reasonably secure wallet. If you are one of those people that uses internet explorer with 6 different toolbars, has a computer riddled with malware and just clicks and downloads anything they see, bitcoin might not be ready for you. If you have an elementary level knowledge of how to install a program on your desktop, follow simple instructions and write down some english words somewhere safe, then you are good to go. The difference is using a program you have control of versus using a web wallet like blockchain.info.

@_date: 2015-05-26 13:51:19
Your forgetting about the mempool which is also stored in RAM, and moreso than the UTXO index IIRC. If transactions are not confirmed fast enough (i.e, saved to disk), then the unconfirmed transaction queue is either going to get so large you need to fork out some serious cash for enough RAM to handle it, or it will max out and reach a point where you literally cannot even submit a transaction to the network because no one will be able to relay it. Both situations are really stupid and easily avoidable by just allowing more transactions to be confirmed at a time (increase the damn limit)
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:10:21
There is still things like dust limits which most nodes enforce (although they don't have to), which make it pretty costly to spam. Try sending a transaction below 0.000054 BTC right now and it will likely be ignored by everyone, or at least take a very long time to confirm (one time I had a transaction take 2 weeks to confirm). A variable block limit could also be capped to only change up to +/- X%, similar to difficulty changes.

Pretty sure it's a problem if those 0-conf transactions stay at 0-conf for several hours or even days because there is such a huge back-log. Transaction fee market is not going to matter if there is hundreds of thousands of transactions pending confirmations, and only 1 or 2,000 being confirmed at a time. It's pretty easy to see how it would quickly become impossible to clear out the mempool. Actually, that problem would probably solve itself because no one is going to want to use a blockchain which they can't even submit transactions to 95% of the time.

I edited it to add that offer like 30 seconds after I posted. You dont need to setup any software or anything, all you need to do is build a raw transaction that would count as valid in the counterparty protocol and then broadcast it (can push it with blockchain.info/pushtx even..). It shouldnt take you more time than you have already spent debating in this thread, which you have done for free anyways. 
If you don't want to hold up to your offer, that's fine, I don't even care anymore. I still disagree with your premise though that XCP is a competing currency to Bitcoin rather than a complementary one, and I don't think either of us are going to budge. 
Have a nice day.

Yeah, I suppose that is a good point. I was thinking less about not getting yourself busted for DNM stuff though and more thinking about other vectors.

@_date: 2015-01-04 01:20:03
The argument is that XCP is a competing currency to Bitcoin, which is false. Spending some amount of bitcoin is required for any counterparty transaction, there is no getting around that even with the "no fee required" argument. How can it possibly compete with something which it directly relies on?
I would also like to know what you consider as "harming" the network, because I think that may be one of the main misunderstandings here.

I don't have 10 BTC unfortunately and am not an investor, just a programmer trying to make a living..  but I would be willing to make a bet of 0.1 BTC
Here are the conditions:
* Must not pay any fee
* ALL outputs must be 0 BTC. Remember, it cannot touch the bitcoin currency at all
* Must be a valid counterparty transaction ([here]( is an example of what one looks like)
* Must get confirmed by a miner (obviously)
* Send me 1 XCP to 1E1VQbeBAK2k3RwQbgnEuN9nrGdxUoEAvU
* Detailing how you pull it off afterwards would be nice
If you can prove that to me, then I stand corrected. 
*edit* I can send you the 1 XCP first if you want.

One of my favourite parts about this is this page:  which they don't seem to have updated since before paycoin even launched, except to add the trademark symbol everywhere.
First off, people actually looked at that and said "this sounds like everything I want in a cryptocurrency and totally legit! what could go wrong?"
Secondly, literally every "feature" listed is a complete lie.
1) Hybrid Flex Blockchain - wtf? This literally does not exist, the paycoin code base is just a shitty knock off of peercoin. Buzz words
2) Hypass Card - also does not exist whatsoever, and any attempts they have made to "integrate" with credit cards etc. have failed laughably - I guess they didn't clue in why nobody accepts credit cards or paypal for buying/selling bitcoin.  
3) Coin Adoption Fund - no indication that this is a real thing either, or certainly not being used. Unless you count in Garza greasing palms for advertising and positive news articles etc..
4) Proof of Reserve - a complete joke, there is zero "proof" about any reserves, and it was stated over and over again that it was at least $100 million in the pot (easily enough to buy up every single coin considering the majority was pre-mined/mined/staked by gaw) and that it would be used to maintain a $20 floor. We all know how that never happened
5) "Miner Rewards" - Paycoin isnt even mined (except for the first 2 weeks), hell even their fake cloud mining operation is shut down. Oh and that little 3000% stake issue... 
6) Merchant Adoption - "launching with more adoption than any cryptocurrency in *the history of the human race*!" except that there was and still is essentially 0 adoption besides I think some person that sells hot sauce. Also, you have to love their [blog post]( where they pull numbers out of their ass and try and say "over 250,000 stores now have paycoin compatibility!", yet if you go to the Paycoin Gateway website, you can see that they only actually have 3 nobody merchants signed up. 1 of those merchants (chad4x4) just posted on hashtalk today that he no longer wants to be associated or involved with paycoin and gaw whatsoever. 
IMO, this is an even bigger train wreck to watch than gox was, and also much more entertaining. 
Can't forget this gem either:

The easiest way to figure out is to just use it. Weather it's worth it or not to get in to depends on what you want to use it for (for example in my case, I do freelance programming and get paid in BTC from various people around the world. much better and easier than getting paid through paypal)
Download electrum (only takes a couple minutes to setup): 
Once you have your Electrum wallet installed and opened up, click on the tab that says "Addresses". These are essentially your "accounts" and they look like a random string of letters+numbers,  something like this: 1NEmcJtFYybrLKohvVaz17rtTUaDHoc3ym. These are what people send bitcoins to, you can create an unlimited amount of addresses and give them out publicly without having to worry (they are for receiving only). Copy and paste one of your addresses and post it here and I can send you a few cents worth so you can see a transaction in action and have some to play with. 
Also check out this website:  and have your mind blown as you watch new transactions on the network being created in real time (click on any of the value amounts which have a green box around it to make it show everything in $ values). I just watched well over $20,000 get moved around in the time I spent writing this comment :p

The "cost per transaction" statistic on blockchain.info makes no sense at all, I wish they would just remove it or at least rename it so it stops causing so much confusion. 
Think about it... the supposed "cost" goes down if either the exchange rate goes down or if the amount of transactions increases (which are the things which are supposedly costing), and likewise increases when exchange rate goes up or transaction count goes down. It's pretty much a completely useless and not even that interesting of a number, but the way they word it it makes it seem like everytime you send a  transaction, someone (or the network collectively) shells out $6 or $32 or whatever the "cost" happens to be at. Its only a cost in a really abstract sense

There already is a fee market and it works good enough. The difference is keeping it at a reasonable level, or letting it get to the extremes where it becomes too expensive and too much of a pain in the ass to use the blockchain for most purposes. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:06:44


That is ridiculous. Yes, technically there is no protocol requirement for a fee, but I challenge you to make a no fee, low value transaction with multisig outputs and embedded data and have that transaction confirm in a reasonable amount of time, or even be accepted by the majority of nodes at all. In reality, transaction fees are necessary, you should know that already.


It's not a competing currency in any form. It relies on bitcoin itself. What don't you get about that?


Yes they are, they are called miners remember? Or are you suggesting that fees should be going to anyone that runs a full node


So, basically what you are saying is that because the number of transactions and blockchain size is increasing, that is the direct cause of the number of bitcoin nodes going down? Isn't that going to happen anyway if BTC is supposed to keep growing and go mainstream? 


Bad example. Do you honestly think that transactions which embed data you do not approve of are the bitcoin equivalent of nuclear waste? 


There is zero harm being done, period. Has there ever been a single case where a transaction of yours was delayed or somehow rejected because of the existence counterparty/colorcoin/mastercoin etc. transactions? Or in other words.. define what "harming" the network actually means.

Yeah, its really bad. MPEx / Mircea and his crew are about the douchiest group of early adopters in the whole crypto community. It's really bad actually. They always go on about how awesome they are because their "stock exchange" once had Satoshi Dice listed on it and currently gets around 20,000 BTC monthly volume. Note though that almost 100% of that amount is from their group trading back and forth one single asset - MPOE, which represents the exchange itself and gives payouts from trading fees (which only come from that single asset) and new user registration fees (30 BTC registration fee, which was set back when BTC was around $10 and they refused to change it on principal..... ). Think about that for a minute.... it's basically a group of early adopters and early miners jacking eachother off. 
About their horrendous website.. I pointed that out to one of them today actually and this is what their response was:


It's been pointed out to them several times before also and always a similar response. They actually believe that their exchange is perfect and anyone who doesn't want to use it is an idiot.

As someone heavily involved in Counterparty (my company is responsible for &gt; 50% of all counterparty tx that have happened, maintains some of the longest running projects, actually involved in protocol development and documentation and arguably has brought in a majority of the users), I can tell you that these guys have done sweet fuck all but been a continual embarrassment, and really a net negative on the project. So many times across reddit and other channels I have seen people bashing counterparty, and almost always in the context of "fuck you chris/junseth". They really have not contributed anything other than being the resident trolls on the chat channels that drive away any newbies / potential business and make it annoying to talk about anything (i.e, everything turns into a 10 hour argument). And yeah, the Community Director position (and in particular, the "election" for it) is a complete joke,  and i'l say that as someone with a business partner and a friend holding 2/3 of the other "community director" positions.

Only if the fees actually get eaten up by miners confirming them, which you need a bigger block size for. We saw in the spam attacks last year that the spammer was able to continue for quite some time simply because the mempool backlog would fill up so much that each new block would barely make a dent in it. Nodes/miners would eventually drop their transactions causing the spammer to receive his funds back and be able to do it again. If we were about to confirm say 10,000 TX per block, he would have had all his funds sucked up by the miners way faster.

Only in theory. In reality the most likely reason the number of nodes has gone down over the time is the mass adoption of web wallets like coinbase and blockchain.info, and SPV wallets like electrum, mycelium etc... there was a time where the only functional wallet was bitcoin core, so it was pretty natural for most users to become nodes. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:44:59
they take 10 minutes *on average*.. it is pretty common actually for blocks to sometimes take 20 minutes or even upwards of an hour to be found (right now even the previous block found took over half an hour). If CEX.IO takes a good chunk of hashpower offline, 20-30 minute+ blocks will be temporarily more common, and resulting in a greater than 10 minute average block time. The difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks IIRC, which would be exactly 2 weeks if every block was found at exactly 10 minutes, but realistically it will be longer. When the 2016 new blocks have passed and during that time the network took over 10 minutes on average per block, then it adjusts accordingly.

The whole Cyprus thing (i.e, people rushing to BTC to avoid capital controls) did not actually happen, it was just all media hype and circle jerking. The price was already sky-rocketing for about a month before any of that happened, and then people were like "look, BTC would be a great solution for these people who are getting screwed over!" which somehow got turned by the media in to "holy crap the people of cyprus are adopting BTC and thats why the price is going way up!!!". In reality probably maybe at most a dozen or so people from there were buying BTC. 
Sorry to say, but Bitcoin is still a minuscule drop in the bucket of the global economy.   The shenanigans between the U.S and Russia, or Greece and the EU or whatever other countries (take your pick)... they don't have any direct influence on BTC or vice-versa. We won't see anything like what people imagined/hoped that Cyrpus was until it becomes incredibly easy to obtain BTC in these places (e.g with very large ATM and local trading networks) and there is much more awareness and understanding of bitcoin in general.

In reality they could just use something like Mycelium, Electrum or Bread Wallet, be set up in no time at all and be reasonably secure.

The argument that XCP is competing with BTC is ludicrous, there is no XCP without BTC and it has its own unique purposes which can't be achieved with plain old BTC (well maybe with a hard fork.. but that will probably never happen).  Every counterparty transaction is a bitcoin transaction, therefore you need to pay transaction fees if you want the tx to confirm in any reasonable amount of time, if at all (especially since it uses multisig). Counterwallet even uses a whole 0.0005 TX fee, which is quite a bit more than the standard fee for most wallets noawadays. Tell me again why we should be worried about XCP "competing" with BTC, because it is literally not possible.. it's a symbiotic relationship. 
Also saying "oh no, but it takes up our precious bandwidth and storage space!!" is absurd. If it is seen as a valid transaction in the protocol and is paying miner fees, what is the problem? Since when is disk space and bandwidth so precious that we should only allow transactions with a specific approved "purpose", regardless if they are paying fees and conform to the protocol or not? When has anyone actually been negatively effected by these transactions in some form (hint: never)? I'm guessing also believes that Satoshi Dice is directly attacking ("DDoSing"... lmao) the network and must be stopped, pretty much the same argument...
Its pretty concerning actually that as one of the core devs, Gregory Maxwell has such a fundamental misunderstanding of how this works. I would suggest that he actually research what he is talking about and actually spent a few hours playing around with Counterparty before he keeps running his mouth, because a lot of what he is saying in the thread OP linked to is just plain false (such as assets being destroyed if you try and transact in a wallet which is not specifically compatible with counterparty)

How is trustless trade cheaper and faster? Also you can make assets on counterparty for free (minus a miners fee)
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:01:34
Again, you don't need to setup any software. Read how counterpartyd encodes transactions and create a transaction yourself, then broadcast it to the network. There is no reason you can't do it with only a native instance of bitcoind, which I would imagine you have at least 1 running. Hell, you don't even need XCP, you could just issue a free numeric asset.
You are the one that offered to prove that it is possible to create a valid counterparty transaction using 0 fees and 0 btc outputs and still get mined. Either actually do it and show me the transaction, or stop arguing about it. If your time is so precious, why are you wasting it continuing to reply to this thread? 
As I mentioned before, the real argument here is weather or not XCP is a competing currency to Bitcoin. Even showing me a transaction that doesn't use any BTC, that still doesnt make it true, it only proves me wrong on one point that I made. XCP only competes with BTC in your hypothetical, incredibly unlikely scenario of all Counterparty nodes only creating 0 fee, 0 output transactions and using XCP as transaction fees to incentivize miners. Is there something else im missing about this?

You would have to sustain a huge attack for a long period of time (weeks, months, a year or whatever would be decided as the change interval) in order to flood the total transaction account by X% to cause an increase.. and for what? Make nodes use potentially 10 or 20% more bandwidth then they were before? I'm sure the miners will appreciate all the extra fees collected from that.

A handful of people invest money, usually earlier on and make a good profit, and then everyone else gets screwed
I did not say that bitcoin mining is a better investment. I think most of us know by now that mining bitcoin is basically throwing money away unless maybe you are setting up a major operation

not enough to have any meaningful effect on the price though. There is about 85,000 BTC in *daily* volume, while only 3600 new BTC minted a day. It's also a fallacy that every single one of those coins is immediately sold that day (more likely a few times a month)  or even sold at all

Allowing a higher transaction capacity to grow and secure the network is entirely different than breaking immutability of the blockchain on short notice to bail out the DAO. The two are not even comparable.

Ok sure. I think that seeing as how we are at &gt; $1000 a coin after less than 10 years, things are going pretty wicked fast still and at a good pace. But just because some may be worried the U.S gov will come hardcore cracking down on everyone one day IMO doesn't mean we should deliberately try and cripple or slow down progress. We don't need 10's of millions of new users joining up right away, that may even be a bad thing as you say. But we should still work on gradually working up towards those kinds of numbers or greater, and ideally it should happen well before I become a senior citizen...


I disagree. I think that bitcoin as-is is already extremely censorship resistance, and this will only grow over time as the value grows and more people participate (which includes greater # of full nodes), though with diminishing returns. I also believe that cryptocurrency as a whole can easily compete with the likes of visa and traditional payment networks. I don't believe such a thing is mutually exclusive with censorship resistance OR decentralization. Long road ahead for sure though.
@_date: 2017-02-17 04:45:06


So are you saying if I upgrade to a segwit supporting wallet, it's going to dump all my transactions into segwit outputs? I would immediately stop using such a wallet.  If that's not the case then you are agreeing with what I said - users will have to consciously choose to use segwit transactions over traditional. 


Too little too late I'm afraid.


Nodes should be able to handle that themselves automatically, I don't see why wallets or other software would care.

This is the process I use with Localbitcoins, not only do I pay less fees but I actually make more money... 
* Receive bitcoin
* Send bitcoin to localbitcoins account (no ID or anything required)
* Activate my listing at a small premium (like 5 or $10 at least more than exchange price I received at)
* Wait some amount of time for one or more people to place an order (usually only a few hours, but never more than a day or 2)
* Receive cash directly in my bank account shortly after (same day)
* Enjoy the fact that I only paid a tiny transaction fee and another tiny fee to localbitcoins, which is easily offset by the price premium. Also getting actual cash in the same day instead of waiting 3-5 business days is a major bonus.
So like, only 5 steps instead of OP's 10 steps and all in a days work with effectively no fee. Works like a charm every time

Well don't complain about exaggerations while doing the same thing yourself... stop taking things at face value.


Your asking me to prove a negative. Rather, I think it's up to you to show that increasing bandwidth usage does real harm to the project, or that the cons outweigh the obvious pros. I can think of many benefits, yet the only con I see is that nodes might get a little bit more expensive to run (again assuming technology doesn't keep up). Who cares if it's more expensive to run if there's more money to be made?
Your other analogies don't even apply at all. In fact, it applies more to general node decentralization &amp; censorship resistance rather than the block size. There's diminishing returns on pixels, or PPI or whatever, at a certain point it's usefulness is already at 99.9999%, adding extra does nothing. Just like there is probably no functional difference between 100,000 nodes and 200,000 nodes. However this is not the case for block space, more transactions = more money for miners, no diminishing return there.

Regarding Counterparty specifically, Bitcoin is required to use it. Therefore if more people are using counterparty, more people are using bitcoin, it's as simple as that, and I am really confused why you don't get that point. Again, Counterparty requires the use of bitcoin to operate. EVEN IF you decide to not pay any fees on any of your transactions.. guess what, you are still sending some amount of bitcoin to multiple addresses. Last I checked, you can't send a transaction of 0 BTC.

Damn, your really just making this shit up as you go along aren't you man..
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:40:02
Not exactly. 
Old nodes only form their own chain if they happen to have some mining power backing them up. Any miners that are left are ones who have not been paying attention at all over the past year, or perhaps a group (likely small) of die hards that wants to intentionally try and keep the old chain running. Either way, the difficulty would be the same but hash rate drops massively, so expect huge delays in new blocks being found, and it would probably take several months for the difficulty to naturally drop down to levels where it would return to the 10 minute interval (IIRC only can change +/- 30% every 2,016 blocks). Fixing the difficulty any faster would require another hard fork. 
So anyone that is left and still producing transactions would notice that everything is taking a very long time to confirm (if confirming at all), and additionally transaction propagation would begin to collapse. It's going to be pretty obvious something is up when your transactions don't even get recognized or don't show up for several minutes, and then take hours/days to confirm, or sit there in limbo.
On top of that, bitcoind displays warnings during different network conditions, such as massive increase/decreases in confirmation times. Plus Gavin has the alert key and can notify all nodes. Not to mention you have to be living in a cave to not hear about it.
The losing money during a hard fork situation only boils down to:
a) lazy miners not paying attention and then mining blocks which are worthless. Or maybe they are just hoarding coins for the day that the 1mb chain rises again...
b) lazy automated web services, particularly those that accept 0-conf
there's good reason to only do hardforks rarely and plan them well in advance, but I don't think we should hold everyone back just because a handful of inactive/oblivious users might experience a bit of down time. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:11:58
I guess you haven't operated a node before?
The vast majority of node operators are miners, bitcoin businesses or developers, with a few tech savvy hobbyists mixed in. 
The vast majority of bitcoin users are in none of those categories.
Individual user adoption of segwit means that non tech-savvy users have to consciously choose to use segwit for their transactions instead of the traditional transaction format - it is extremely unlikely users will be forced into it or even made default on most wallets. 
Custom programming of non-node software and infrastructure means that I have to spend a non-trivial amount of time and money upgrading various platforms that I have developed or that I operate. e.g payment processors and other custom applications. Collectively this is quite a large cost to the ecosystem.
Upgrading your nodes is the easy part, it's just downloading and maybe doing a re-install. Not often more than a 10 minute process. This is all that a simple block size increase hard fork would require for the entire ecosystem, yet it would only involve the 3 or 4 groups I mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:02:41
Yes definitely. There is all this talk around here about consensus but nobody ever wants to put it to the test. In fact folks like have stated that the reason for doing segwit as a soft-fork is specifically so they **don't** have to get full network consensus.

Yes it is. You believe that the only reason to do segwit as a hard fork is with intent to fracture the network. That's opinion bro. How about getting full network consensus? How about applying malleability fix to all network transactions? I can think of several reasons. 
Who cares anyway, segwit isn't going to make a dent in the transaction capacity problem, which is the primary concern right now for the people actually regularly using the network.

Right, but that hasn't stopped some of them from trying. Obviously Core as a whole is just a software project and not organized top down, but when Jihan or others talk about Core like this, it's  referencing the IRC cabal that consists of certain prominent devs from Core (including the maintainer and those with commit access), Blockstream who has hired many people that previously worked on Core, and Theymos and co that are die hard supporters. They get lumped into a single social group/faction in the same way that you guys to do the other sub, BU, Ver etc..


It actually has, look it up. There was the march 2013 accidental fork, which later turned into  August 2013 real hard fork. Nobody noticed (including myself ironically) because most had already upgraded a few months before. This is testable, go load up a pre 0.8 client and try it out.


He's probably talking about SW as the advertised holy grail solution to the capacity (block size) problem. It's "leading" but only if you consider slightly ahead in a stalemate as being in the lead. Malleability isn't as much of a pressing issue and not what the debate is about.

Viacoin and clearinghouse is a scam.

He then pissed it all away and to this day no one really uses viacoin.

@_date: 2017-02-12 16:12:06
Are you joking? Blocks have been constantly full for ages now, there is absolutely no shortage of transactions to choose from for all miners to maximize their collected tx fees at all times. Furthermore, you should know  that miners also typically can and do relay transactions, there isn't any guarantee that if you broadcast ONLY to your favorite segwit supporting mining pool that it will keep that tx for itself instead of relaying across the rest of the network as normal. 
I don't think OP's script really accomplishes anything other than potentially slowing down your own tx propagation, but even that is probably negligible.. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:10:16
Fees are enforced by the "minrelaytxfee" setting that each node and miner uses to choose what minimum value they care about. Just as the majority of transactions paid fees (often even higher than today in terms of raw BTC, though it was worth 100x less) when there was plenty of block space to go around, transactions fees will continue to be paid in the future in the same way. 
I don't see how fees will tend to fall towards 0 the more space there is, unless you are also implying that miners will be dynamically adjusting down their minrelaytxfee as they mine bigger blocks?
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:46:44
except that sorting by fee is a terrible idea because if all nodes ejected the same transactions, a new side effect of the spam attacks would be to completely drop plenty of transactions of legit users just because they didn't pay high enough fee. Currently pretty much all the spam attacks do is create a bit of a backlog causing extra long confirmations in some cases. This change actually makes the attacks more disruptive.

Your belief is incorrect. There is no real time limit for when a transaction can confirm. I once had one stuck in limbo over 2 weeks before it finally went through.
2 hours to make it into a block is not all that uncommon these days. Particularly when right now there is a backlog of over 50,000 transactions (but only 2500 - 3000 confirmed per block because of the 1MB limit).

That's about 50 satoshis per byte, which is slightly on the lower end but not too terrible. Most of the transactions I'm watching are paying 60 or more, many paying 120+ which is abnormal, been getting higher lately.. So it might be a while longer still, hopefully within the day. 
If you really can't wait that long for the transaction to complete, your other option is you can double spend yourself with a much higher fee. Difficulty of this somewhat depends on your wallet and technical ability.

Anyone who believes this conspiracy crap is hardcore pushing,  see my reply ~~on this same thread in the btc sub~~ for some actual, not completely retarded reasons why Segwit is not an acceptable solution to the tx capacity problem. 
*edit* actually I'l just re-post it here w/e.
First off, they are replacing the block size limit with a "block weight" limit which puts us right back at the same issue, only a little more confusing and complicated. Get ready for the upcoming "Great Block Weight Debate" where we argue for 3 years on why the 4 should become an 8 and we discount witness data even further to compensate. 
Secondly, the whole idea behind the 75% witness data discount is that for some reason it's a smart idea to simply discard transaction signatures after you first see them, because who cares about such silly things? It's not like signatures are literally what prove a transaction is valid &amp; authorized or not. Nodes and miners can choose not to store them and save a little bit of disk space, thus all transactions in this format get this magical giant discount, even though they use the same or even more amount of bandwidth (the main cost). 
The discount doesn't make a whole lot of sense and feels like just a number they pulled from their ass. Why would a miner or any economically important node discard witness data/transaction signatures? What happens if they need to rescan/reindex/revalidate the chain for whatever reason (which is not uncommon)? Furthermore, if disk space is a concern for any node operator, pruning is a much better option then throwing away tx proofs. AFAIK not even segwit enabled nodes will be operating in this way for quite some time, which makes it seem even more pointless to me.






These statements don't even make sense. If they're talking about malleability, how is preventing your unconfirmed transaction chain from breaking (causing you to have to resend, so horrible) "doubling" security?


Here's what they don't tell you about this: P2SH is a hack in order to create "segwit" transactions which are recognized pretty much universally across bitcoin nodes &amp; software. The downside to this hack is that it creates larger transactions than what a normal segwit tx would be, so you don't actually get the true savings as advertised. "Real" segwit transactions have two problems, one being that they have not even figured out what the addresses will look like, and the other being that even if they did, everything in the bitcoin economy needs to be upgraded to recognize it, which is similar effort to a hard fork. Be prepared to move your UTXOs to new addresses yet again..
Overall - yes, segwit can result in technically "bigger blocks", but the actual amount of additional transactions it enables per block is negligible (would have been an ok bump 2 years ago, too little too late now), there is all sorts of caveats to get to that point and it makes shit unnecessarily complicated when we already have had at least 3 much better solutions on the table (hard forks proposed by XT, Classic and Unlimited respectively. Also the many other block size BIPs that could have done the job). We need to collectively stop dicking around and get rid of the damn limit already. Making everyone use a new tx format as a hack around said limit is a huge cop out IMHO. And for those that say what about the Layer 2 stuff SW enables... cool, that's a separate topic than L1 chain scaling.

Payment channels have their place and will be important, but I don't think anyone is saying that raising the limit (or getting rid of it) would replace those kind of solutions, it just buys us more time to get it right.

Bitcoin has the network effect and real economy. No other alt coin has that, the closest (still far off) is maybe ethereum but they have their own problems. That's not something you can replicate overnight. I can go create my own network and send transactions for free, who cares though when there is no one to send to? "Well you just have to convince that other person to accept it!" you say - but that's exactly my point. We've been building this all up for the past 8 years. If you want to start back at the bottom, feel free (as many alt-coins are trying).

Yes you are 100% correct. Realisitcally when the fork is triggered, much less than 25% hash rate will be on the minority chain though. The incentives (in theory) are strong enough that BTCC and Bitfury are bound to cave eventually.  What do the retarget numbers look like when there is 5%, 1% or even less hash rate left?

@_date: 2016-01-27 03:40:25
Greg, forgetting everything else for a minute... pretty much everyone seems to agree that a block size limit increase to 2MB is reasonably safe (no, **not** talking about any potential "effective capacity increase" that SW gives, so don't even mention that because it's been said 10,000 times, we know). 
Why not budge *just a little bit*, cave in and get on board with this hard fork? All you need to do is say that you agree (even reluctantly) and get the other main folks at Core to agree as well (highly likely if its your initiative), and then Classic + Core + any other forks/implementations can work together on making this a clean and smooth upgrade for everyone, no contention needed. If everyone can finally agree, you could plan it out for like 6 or 8 months down the road (since one of the main complaints about Classic currently is trying to hard fork too fast), wouldn't be a problem. Just like that the debate would be over with, we can all get a long (for the most part) and you can go back to working on fancy things like confidential transactions. 
Whether you admit it or like it or not, you are one of the few people that can turn the tides on this and prevent a real split from happening. Just like says in the OP, Core can put an end to this if the cards are played right. Use it or lose it bud
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:59:30
Your totally right, except this debate has nothing to do with immutability - unless you are talking about immutability as in there can never be a change to any of the consensus code ever, but even Core is not advocating that.

We don't take LTBcoin as seriously as you think we do. Also, obviously a hot wallet system where accounts get credited internally and then people manually withdraw would be way cheaper and more efficient, that's basic stuff...but that doesn't solve the problem of "how do you get counterparty tokens into the hands of a large number of wallets without sending each tx manually or building a hot wallet and requiring extra user interaction". We solved that problem and are turning it into a product, and the prototype has been used by 6 or 7 other projects so far besides LTB.  LTB is basically a prototyping grounds for Tokenly, at least as far as the Counterparty stuff is concerned. Think what you will of it.
@_date: 2016-01-29 15:03:50
Since when was this about having our transactions cost less, as opposed to just getting confirmed in a decent timeframe? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:04:51
Bram Cohen hated bitcoin for years and thought it was retarded, only getting in and changing his mind well after $1000+ was hit. Just because you built a P2P protocol doesn't mean you have much understanding or expertise in the cryptocurrency realm. This shows pretty clearly when he claims his "Proof of Space" idea would totally be better than Proof of Work and PoW is nothing but waste. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 15:34:24
Yep, you can keep hand waving away the problems and say transaction fees will solve everything.... There is still serious technical problems that happen when the network has too many transactions, saying "oh well, there will never be that many transactions because derp tx fees derp supply and demand" is frankly really retarded. If bitcoin is too expensive and too unreliable to use, people will either go use a different blockchain, or the idea of crypto will die out in general. Or maybe bitcoin will stay just a small niche thing. Either way sounds like failure to me. 


And what if there is a million + people out there making larger transactions? If BTC goes mainstream, it's not hard to imagine a measly 1 million people making say at least 1 TX a day of at least a couple hundred $ in value, which they probably won't want to do using off-chain or  centralized systems. That alone would mean 10X the network usage that we have today, at which point we already start running into the technical problems that have been talked about. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 14:16:15
Peter, do you even use bitcoin? Do you even look at what is happening on the network? It almost seems like you don't, because what you are saying is pure BS. Look at blockchain.info right now, blocks are consistently getting close to the 1MB limit. You honestly think it is going to take YEARS before we do an average additional 300KB or so in transactions per block? Give me a fucking break man. 
Also, all the "serious risks" that you guys keep talking about pretty much boil down to really vague situations which have not even happened before - such as someone suddenly generating millions of transactions to flood the network and bloat the UTXO index, because reasons. They can already do something similar by flooding the mempool, so why don't they? 
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:39:12
Most likely what he meant is that there will only be One Bitcoin, there will be no real meaningful "network split". Only one chain survives this. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:40:19
Scared OP is panicing lol
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:45:14
Totally agreed, the arguments are getting kind of ridiculous. Why do I have a feeling that bumping the limit is not going to suddenly spell the end of bitcoin as we know it and cause the entire network to be attacked, or crumble from no one apparently being able to run a node? I'm willing to bet money that it will just be business as usual..
There is also a third camp which you haven't mentioned yet though: the people who believe that the 1 MB limit is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin. Their wet dream is for bitcoin to eventually become a purely "high value transfer network", where the common man cannot effectively use the blockchain at all due to such intense transaction fee competition, and it essentially becomes a fancy settlement network for the banks, corporations and elite of the world. These guys don't care if the average person cannot run or a node, and they don't care if the entire world is using the blockchain directly... in fact they *want* bitcoin to be limited to effectively 3 transactions per second, forever, because "economics", I guess. They also seem to be mostly early adopters who have built some sort of bizarre doctrine around this, and surprise surprise would  have the most to gain if that happened. Seriously, fuck those selfish fucks (prime example: Mircea popescu). 
Also, I find it funny how one of the primary selling points of BTC over the years has been that it is a) fast and b) very cheap transaction fees. Man, we are going to look really fucking stupid if all of a sudden it takes several hours/days/weeks or whatever to get a transaction confirmed due to a massive back-log (you think transaction fee market is going to matter if there is half a million unconfirmed transactions and growing, and only like 2000 at a time confirmed?) and/or if it costs something like $10 in transaction fees just to get near the top of the queue. The more likely scenario is that people will just stop using bitcoin at that point, why bother if it is expensive to use and so fucking slow to confirm for most people? Might as well use a different cryptocurrency which doesn't give a terrible user experience. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:24:17
I'm running 3 full nodes because they are actually useful to run and needed for my business and projects. No amount of increased block limit / blockchain size is going to change my need to run nodes or cause me to shut them down.

A counterparty transaction is *smaller* than a typical bitcoin transaction, and the extra data it includes can be safely pruned by nodes, effectively making them even smaller.

Or does he assume they will  now all be in a combination of LN and sidechains? Quite sad how people around here basically want to throw in the towel for Bitcoin being a worldwide currency usable by the common  man (not just the rich or westerners). 
Also, I really can't take seriously any arguments that go along the lines of "if you let more people use bitcoin it will become paypal 2.0!!"... paypal and bitcoin are fundamentally completely different systems, not even comparable and there is 0 risk of bitcoin becoming like it. Saying otherwise is being willfully ignorant at best. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:44:30
I'm saying that it's already being attempted (hence the existence of alt-coins), so adding another to the mix is probably pointless and yeah also extremely likely to fail. You should try looking a little deeper into how this stuff works and why bitcoin has been as successful as it has been.

You know what else pushes up the cost of the attack without effecting end users? Raising the block size (keeps the mempool clear). 
I agree there should be mempool limiting though. I experienced first hand bitcoind crapping itself repeatedly due to massive backlogs earlier last year..  I prefer random TX's and their childs/parents being removed instead though (perhaps taking into account some level of priority). That way you are pretty much guaranteed that your tx lives on in some mempool somewhere in the world. Even if it was something like take the bottom 20% lowest fee paying tx and choose randomly from that, that would be fine.

is actually the one lying here, unsurprisingly. I'l just explain it to you; The plan is called Segregated Witness (SW). The basic idea is that signatures (aka "witnesses")  are separated away from transactions (aka taken out of regular blocks) and put in their own separate data structure. A trick (trick  is used to make old bitcoin nodes see SW transactions as valid even without the signatures where they expect. A side effect of this is that old nodes who do not upgrade, while still being able to transact etc., would not actually be properly validating these new transactions and thus have lower security (you can't fully trust your copy of the chain). Having these two things separated has some advantages in terms of transaction processing &amp; validation, and less variable data to hash for the TX ID - which mostly fixes the transaction malleability issue. This was one of the original purposes of SW, it was something already being worked on outside of the block size debate. 
Now, just so happens (trick  signatures being the largest part of a transaction means it technically makes the "transaction" portion a decent amount smaller. Smaller transactions = more transactions can theoretically fit in a block. Thus more transactions can be confirmed per 10 minutes without going over the hardcoded 1MB limit. When they say that SW gives an "effective increase of ~2MB" (note the ~), what they actually mean is "each block can potentially store as many transactions with current 1MB block size as if it was around 2MB, give or take X% depending on our mood". That's of course assuming that every transaction is using this new format for maximum block efficiency (aka every wallet, service and user has to have this implemented and use it, even if their code doesn't care about block size and can already work at any limit or no limit). Also, it is still the same amount of data, so the centralization concerns due to increased bandwidth + storage still apply.
In order to give an incentive (trick  for people to stop doing things the way they are now and use this new transaction format, they have made it so the "witness" data is discounted by 75% in the minimum fee calculations and given higher priority, meaning transactions using SW are cheaper. 
They plan to have this fully implemented and deployed by April (or maybe May or June, who knows... how's that coming along..?). After X amount of time it will be put into production code, then we will have to wait for miners to upgrade until AFAIK a 95% threshold is reached and the code becomes enabled some point after that. Then wait for all the services and wallets to upgrade. Then unless it becomes the default or only way to transaction everywhere, wait for users individually to catch on and take advantage of it. 
While SW can "effectively increase" the block size via accounting tricks, it is quite literally NOT a block size limit increase (unless wants to point us to their code that changes MAX_BLOCK_SIZE).

@_date: 2015-05-18 23:04:05
I'm surprised these points haven't been brought up more. I guess technically yeah you could send 0 fee transactions of just 1 satoshi, but good friggin luck having that mined or relayed by anyone on the network (also you guys complain about block chain bloat now....). The only way they are going to pull that off is if they have a massive mining pool specifically configured to mine those transactions, and solo mining definitely would not work since these devices individually would maybe find a block every thousand years or something... I wonder what the total hash rate of say 10 million of these chips is compared to some of the major warehouse mining ops going on (which also constantly upgrade)?
The whole battery life thing seems like a major downside to.. There has to be more to this than what we've been told so far

You can pick any two points in time to support your argument... Im guessing you first started looking into bitcoin during or after the late 2013 price spike madness, and now think it's retarded because it has mostly gone downhill price-wise since. Put your self back just one more year and suddenly that "loss" is still an over 4000% price increase. Or how about a few years before that, when bitcoin was worth literally nothing, so is up by an infinite percent? It's a matter of perspective, and either way not a good argument for or against. 
Also you can't seriously expect a small, completely unregulated market for a totally new currency &amp; payments technology to not be all over the place during its early years. If that scares you or seems stupid, you should probably move on from bitcoin and forget about it for a while.

That's not how it works right now, it's not how it used to work, it's not how it's going to work in the future. You are living in a fantasy if you think otherwise. Just because something is technically possible doesn't mean that it will happen or that it's a practical idea. 


Care to name names? Whoever you are talking about, they obviously don't have a clue and probably only invested in XCP but don't have any actual projects. Sorry they gave you a bad impression, but that sounds like the exact opposite of the attitude of everyone I have talked to who is actually involved and representing the majority of active use cases. Why do you want to make the Counterparty community out as some sort of enemy so badly? 
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:46:46
::sigh:: still pushing this bullshit? It's almost like you don't actually use the bitcoin network, since you think it is apparantly so easy to send these 0 value 0 fee transactions and still get mined. But right, miners could theoretically take tx fee payments in whatever they want in the future and counterparty could rewrite itself to work totally different, therefore you are 100% right, especially because you have 2 eyes and a working brain... Correct? Why can't you just accept that Counterparty is a value add and an ally to the bitcoin ecosystem instead of spreading your FUD every chance you get? We are not going away no matter how bad you want, get used to it.

Interesting you use that quote considering that Counterparty has no proof of work quorum, and it doesn't have it's own seperate fees either (unless you count the anti-spam XCP fee for issuing *vanity* assets). Seeing as how your standard Counterparty transaction is only a handful of bytes larger than your standard BTC transaction (and even smaller when pruned), still pays miner fees and brings new value to the btc blockchain... somehow I think Satoshi wouldn't mind. 


Wow that's rich.

It's actually because there is huge amount of things you cannot do at all with bitcoind alone and have to have a secondary layer on top to perform advanced tasks and to also be scalable at all. e.g You can't use the raw RPC client to properly serve 10's of thousands of wallet clients at once..
After 5 years of using  Bitcoin Core and it's variations, I can tell you it does its job decently well but overall it's not a very great piece of software to develop with.

They don't even know how segwit will play out. People around here seriously believed it would be out by last April and activated shortly after. It didn't come out till November and here we are 3 months later still not activated and completely stagnated miner adoption, and a competing solution with 15% hash rate ensuring that the 95% trigger doesn't happen. Doesn't look like much is changing but who knows.

This is actually why Lightning Network isn't as big of a deal as it's made out to be. The truth is for most use cases and transactions, confirmation times don't matter a whole lot as long as it happens a) eventually and b) in relatively reasonable amount of time. The confirmation is the settlement, not the transaction itself. If you buy something, the merchant can immediately detect the tx and send you on your way, or if for example someone owes me money, I don't need to wait for confirmations to know that I've received funds. Chances are I probably don't need to spend it in &lt; 10 minutes anyway. And even if I did need to spend, you can chain unconfirmed transactions together no problem (slight small chance need to resend some due to malleability, but no biggie). LN is fine for quick microtransactions, but for most other things it just makes it more complicated. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:03:31


Hahaha, so hostile all the time aren't you folks? Sorry that you bought into the groupthink so badly, but you are absolutely 100% wrong here, nobody serious about Bitcoin wants this, and there is zero proof that big blocks would result in it. Just drop this retarded paypal meme already.


As someone who runs multiple full nodes, I can tell you right now that 8MB and even above is no problem to handle resource wise. Maybe a little more expensive, but that's the cost of doing business with the blockchain, and a pretty minor one at that. 
But again you are wrong here. Running a full node that sits there and does nothing except relay transactions does essentially nothing for "decentralization" or security of the network. If you use your node for economic or business purposes, yes. If you are a miner, yes. If your some random redditor running a node as a hobby because it makes you feel good, sorry to burst your bubble but your not actually effecting anything. Same with the people spinning up 500+ nodes of BU or whatever on Amazon.


Malleability wasn't a part of the whitepaper, and it also has nothing to do with increasing the block size. Also if you knew anything about it, you would know that it's an overblown issue that is easy to work around in most cases and not even that common of a problem. I also see no inherent problem with fixing it, so not sure what your going on about. 


Why do they need to run a node then if they are that cheap and lazy? "Muh feelings"?

This is just dumb and shows how gullible you are lol.


Oh no, the network can handle more transaction capacity, the horror! Hide yo kids, hide yo wife...


It's not even that hard, and if you just gave up you obviously didn't have any actual need or use for it.


No, try a couple days.


Right from the very start, Bitcoin was always an infinitely growing database where all on-chain transactions are stored forever. What the hell did you think you signed up for?
Oh and the whole chain can be stored multiple times over on a $50 hard drive. Poor you.


Capacity for 8X more transaction volume doesn't translate into 8X more "difficult" to set up, that's silly. It's like saying modern video games are harder to install because they use more disk space.. 


Lol. Supporter of big blocks here since this thing started and before you were probably even into bitcoin at all. I've operated several full nodes over the past 5 years, I'm all for decentralization and your an idiot if you think anyone actually wants to turn bitcoin into literally PayPal 2.0. The $1 coffee thing is a dumb meme no one talks about seriously outside of this subreddit, and it shows the total lack of imagination here on how money is used. Which is just sad. Also shitting on the whitepaper founding document just tells me you probably are a newb and never read it. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:27:10
I'm sure he also still figures that once segwit activates (any day now guys...) that suddenly 4X capacity will be available so *really* it would be more like starting at 1.2 MB.

I haven't used breadwallet before so not sure if they have an option to override the fee, and unless it also has replace-by-fee support then there isn't really anything you can do other than wait it out. The unconfirmed transaction backlog is starting to dwindle finally, down to around 15K unconfirmed so probably won't be all that much longer for you to get some confirmations. If JM bouillon cancels your order because it's taking too long, you would have to contact them to get a manual refund. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:36:00

Segwit is not a real block size limit increase, and you won't be seeing 2MB blocks anytime soon if/when it activates - but keep telling yourself that.

@_date: 2017-08-04 14:45:43
lol! Sick argument bro. 
@_date: 2016-11-10 21:25:24


The whole point of increase to 2MB is to buy more time for figuring out a more permanent solution, since the whole double every 2 years for 20 years thing didn't catch on. Most agree that block size needs to go up eventually, so why keep waiting?


In what way is HF-SW specifically dangerous as opposed to the soft fork version? That doesn't make sense to me. As for arguments against hard forks in general, sure.. but again most even in Blockstream/Core agree that a hard fork is going to happen eventually. So why keep waiting?


There actually isn't any evidence of that whatsoever. If that were true why have blocks not been 100% full for bitcoins entire lifetime? 


Well IMHO the idea of ever increasing fee pressure and users of bitcoin being cool with paying a constantly higher fee (I assume also compounded by price increases), pretty retarded and not going to work in the real world. Your risking killing one of bitcoins competitive advantages in order to test an armchair economic theory. We have altcoins for that my friend.


Still with the same false argument... node count was only so high before because running a node was literally the only way you could use bitcoin in the first place. Now there are ridiculously better and more user friendly wallets out there, there isn't any practical point in running a node unless you are a developer or are using it for your business. And even for devs, there is 1000 APIs available to you. I've yet to meet anybody that has closed down their node because tx volume was approaching too close to the 1MB limit. That's silly.


We'l see


Oh ok, have fun with your altcoin then.

@_date: 2016-11-25 14:44:28
The incentives are not that strong and are contradicted by the "fee market" approach. Wallets don't make transactions themselves, people do - so it depends on if they force it on everyone as a default or if it's just an extra option you can choose. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 03:50:18
segwit will have &lt; 5% impact over the next 6+ months IF it even activates at all, and probably won't see anywhere close to 100% in terms of capacity increase for 1 - 3 years maybe more. I'd bet money on this.
Normal increase from 1MB to 2MB would have given a 100% impact immediately and we could have done it over a year ago. Nice work blocking progress. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:02:23


They would have to upgrade their nodes which takes like 10 minutes. How exactly is money magically lost from temporarily being on the wrong fork? Do you private keys suddenly become invalidated? At worst you might have to resend some transactions. The danger here is hugely overstated.

A lot of companies have suspended deposits, withdrawals and other transactions for this fork, mine included. And the advice for  many has been to either sell prior or to hodl.

@_date: 2017-08-04 14:45:23
LN is a convoluted deposit + withdrawal system. You deposit your bitcoin into the channel, and then after it's confirmed you can spend your deposited coin with other LN users. But it gets weird because each user on the receiving end can only receive a maximum of the amount of BTC that was on the other side of their open channel, and likewise for yourself. So for example, if you enter LN with a channel that is 1:1 (1 BTC on each side), you can only send a total of 1 BTC and are able to receive a total of 1, but not any more than that unless you close and re-open (which takes time waiting for confirmations + miner fees). So the most you can end up with in that case is 2 BTC. But what if someone wants to send you more than what your channel has available? Additionally, the number of hops your payment has to take is unpredictable and deducts a fee each time. Another consequence is that the more channels open, the more BTC has to be locked up and unusable. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 17:35:06
Pretty handy if your transaction has been in limbo for 12+ hours though which is becoming increasingly common. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 14:43:01
Nope, segwit requires WAY more work than a hard fork would have. 
In the hard fork situation, all miners have to upgrade and all nodes have to upgrade (normal people don't run nodes, mostly businesses and miners). That's it, no wallet and no web service or exchange or anyone else would need to lift a finger.
With this segwit soft fork... all miners have to upgrade, all nodes have to upgrade (eventually if they want to still fully validate the blockchain), all wallets, block explorers, payment processors, exchanges etc. also have to upgrade their software (not just their nodes). 
@_date: 2016-11-25 04:01:41

@_date: 2016-11-29 18:37:39
Actually malleability doesn't really make double spends any easier. It just means if you are a service accepting bitcoin payments, the transaction ID you see at first might not be the same transaction ID when it confirms. Unless you have built your system like an absolute moron (e.g Karpeles/Mtgox), it isn't much more than an inconvenience. 
The more practical issue with malleability though is chaining together unconfirmed transactions one after the other. If one of the txids changes, the chain breaks and the subsequent transactions invalidate (no longer correct UTXOs for inputs). This just results in having to resend transactions, which is annoying, but no loss of funds or anything like that.
@_date: 2016-11-25 14:13:52
1) Transaction fees in the past and even right now (to me at least) are low enough to not really care much about in most instances, sometimes I even pay extra just for shits or if I want to make sure it goes through right away. Sometimes I pay hardly anything if I don't care about it taking several hours or a day or so. Up to 75% less of what is already a tiny fraction of the value being moved, isn't really all *that* enticing of an incentive. It does add up though I suppose, so it's not nothing. 
2) The fee market that Blockstream wants directly contradicts this one incentive they made for segwit adoption. If fees are up 75% on average and you get to pay 75% less than that, you aren't saving money. Blocks are already full and have been for some time, the fee pressure is slowly mounting, if segwit activates it will only have a gradual effect as people start using it, which means blocks will always be full. Using segwit might mean that you can pay less than other participants on the network at the moment, but that price is probably going to be higher than today.

@_date: 2016-11-25 14:26:02
Do you think it's likely that all wallets will be forcing users to only make segwit addresses and perform segwit transactions? Or will it just be an extra option tucked away?
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:12:03
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:20:01


Sure. So depending on how much I want to be able to receive, I have to have multiple channels open and potentially have payments split up between them. Cool logic...


Fair point.


You misunderstand. If it was just one single channel between sender and receiver, that's not really LN... that's just a regular payment channel. In LN, each user has one (or more I guess) channels that they enter into, but the payments typically go through unknown multiple hops of other peoples channels.


Well yeah LN/payment channels work best for smaller repeat payments of course. Some people seem to think that literally everything should happen over LN and the blockchain should become essentially an LN settlement layer, which I think is dumb. 


When the network is congested (which is stupid easy at 1MB), those 5 satoshi/byte txs aren't going through anytime soon. Do you not remember fees recently being $5+ on the regular just to make it into the chain on the same day? 


I meant unusable for things outside LN, thought that was obvious. For example if I'm a LN channel provider, if I want to allow 5 different people to receive up to 1 BTC, I have to lock up 5 BTC into these various channels for however long. As a business, that makes things like cash flow more complicated. I guess you can earn some fees for relaying payments, but still it's a weird and kind of convoluted system you have to admit. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:06:00
I'm not sure actually. I assume you can still embed OP_RETURN outputs, and counterparty just recently finally got P2SH support. So it might be doable without a xcp protocol update, but most certainly will require some rewriting of Counterwallet, Indiesquare wallet and also our Tokenly Pockets wallet (which new version is a fork of Copay so we can probably borrow from them when they finish SW support). We have tons of other higher priority things to work on first though. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:54:31
Why can't we get rid of transaction malleability for EVERYONE not just people that use segwit transactions? Why keep that legacy issue around?
@_date: 2016-11-25 13:46:39
Sure, depends on what their implementations look like though and if they set it as the default transaction type. I'm interested to see what it will actually look like in practice. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 13:16:33
Personally I can't wait to see the dissapointment around here once segwit activates (if at all) and you guys finally realize that it's going to provide hardly any relief towards the capacity issue, and possibly won't be for multiple years until fully adopted at the user level. Too little too late
@_date: 2016-11-25 18:14:40
Bitcoin has already been suffering over this issue (which could have been dealt with a year ago), and in fact I'l be feeling the pain of continuous backlogs and rising fees a lot more than most  people here.

lol what? I run nodes because I actually use them for things. You seem confused.


Are they?


Wrong again. The paper outlines the vision and game theory etc., but it doesn't go into specific code implementation details. Malleability has nothing to do with the whitepaper. Try reading it at least once.


So what is it then?


So much assumptions. I haven't invested into anything dude and I don't even have a large coin stash to begin with (I sell most of what I get to pay bills and eat food). I look forward to watching the collective meltdown in this sub when the chain flip occurs (assuming that 2X falls through). 
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:07:49
So are you saying as soon as segwit gets activated we will see 4 - 6,000 transactions confirming every block instead of of the current 2 - 3,000?
@_date: 2016-11-10 18:59:44
In my eyes SW was more of a cop-out than a compromise. It was a "oh hey, here is this thing my for-profit company has already been working on that we need for our future projects, and it just so happens it can provide  ~~4MB~~ 1.7 MB in capacity ^(*terms and conditions apply). Now you better accept it, and if you don't then you must be anti-scaling and are a heritic. But don't worry, you will totally have your new capacity by ~~april~~  ~~july~~  ~~october~~ TBA 2017!! ". Don't get me wrong, SW itself is fine, but the politics of how it was brought out, and the false expectation that it was ever going to provide some relief of network congestion in any reasonable timeframe.. just retarded IMO. 
Here's a real compromise: Pair SW with a simple increase to 2MB. Include a malleability fix for old style P2PK address transactions. Exercise the networks capability to pull off a successful hard fork, and the opportunity can be taken to do any cleanup or additional improvements to segwit that could only be done via HF. 
* Blockstream gets their improvements into the system and can start rapidly moving forward with everything else (e.g lightning)
* People in the big-blocker crowd can finally have a bone thrown at them and chew on it for a while, chill out (tip: no one is going away, can either fight with these people for years on end or start working together).
* Network congestion gets some immediate relief, businesses and users like myself can now use the network more smoothly and reliably (like it used to be, although at the moment it's not actually that bad except on occasion). User complaints about confirmation times and fee wackyness goes down. 
* Immediate relief gives time for SW adoption to grow, which in turn buys us more time to figure out how to scale to next level again. 
* All transactions from all addresses get a malleability fix, instead of effectively depreciating the old "1" style addresses. 
Sound like a plan or what?

It only removes malleability for segwit transactions. All other transactions (e.g from regular 1.. style addresses, which is what the vast majority of the bitcoin economy uses) still have the same problems. Basically non-segwit transactions become second class citizens. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 12:13:54
The use cases for LN and payment channels are actually a lot less than people think as well. How many situations are there where it is ideal to pre-pay the max amount you are willing to spend (opening channel) and recieve a rebate at the end (closing channel)? 
@_date: 2016-11-25 13:08:23
Why do you never mention that the caveat for "doubling capacity" is that everyone using the network has to start using the new tx format? Very disingenuous. Want to make a bet on how long it's going to take to get any significant user adoption and thus make an impact? Probably 2 - 3 years and certainly less than 5% or 10% impact over the next 6 months to 1 year. Wow so heroic, such compromise..

As a co-founder of Tokenly, I fully admit to this being part of my motivation for wanting larger blocks..

Why are you so horribly misguided and assuming random things about me? S2X isn't an attack, don't be gullible. It's a proposed upgrade that will either be accepted or rejected. You guys are losing your minds over this so badly that your turning on everyone who has dedicated years of their life to this industry and just want to help it grow, and labeling those same people as "enemies of bitcoin".

Ok, so you messaged me personally yesterday expressing some concern that a blockstream employee is suggesting the recent supposed email from Satoshi is legitimate










And here we are again with your blockstream buddies giving themselves a high five over a most likely fake email, and further giving people the impression that it's real. Complain about appeals to authority, and then use appeal to authority yourself.. mmk then.

So BIP100 isn't even implemented, so far we have gotten little to no answers on everyone's concerns about it (only a couple very brief responses from and it introduces an entirely new and untested dynamic of persistent miner voting to change an arbitrary system setting.. and yet (arguably to no surprise), the miners are all over it.
Now there is like 4 camps:
* (small) group of devs and a few early adopters and other characters who believe anything &gt; 1MB will  never be the "true bitcoin", or at least we are nowhere near ready for it.
* Another group of devs which almost all have their own separate ideas (some with actual BIPs, some not) on when and how an increase should be done
* A significant portion of the community and the so called "economic majority" who favours BIP 101 with the static, predictable increase over time.
* An apparent majority of the miners favouring the even  more experimental BIP100
And there is still a good 3 months left before any possible fork actually happens. It's kind of anyone's game at this point
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:44:42
If dynamic is better than IMO a block size which changes based on average transaction volume over e.g last 10,000 blocks is preferable than one just voted on by miners. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 15:48:37
It's essentially a static brochure website, and it looks like it was built in a day, maybe two tops. Or I guess it's acceptable as a web developer to say "hey, you have a high traffic domain name, this project is magically 1000x more expensive now?"
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:44:32
You really are something else man. You should stick to worrying about viacoin
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:27:08
IIRC 32MB limit is actually the result of another piece of the protocol which needs to be rebuilt to support messages that large. Before the 1MB limit was in place, there was still effectively a 32MB limit anyways. BIP 101 doubles every two years, but after the year 2020 if we want it to keep increasing, that same issue will need to be dealt with. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:54:40

@_date: 2015-08-16 01:06:42
sure, but the other stuff has nothing to do with the protocol, they are just minor software improvements. Making a fuss about having an extra command that you can use to build your applications with easier seems a bit silly. And if you want to be really anal about it you might as well maintain your own fork and pick and choose every patch you want. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:25:28

Sorry to be blunt, but it is incredibly retarded that you would even think XT releasing a modified version of the transaction ledger which somehow gives a bunch of people their coins back is anywhere in the realm of possibility. And as points out Bitcoin Core could do the same thing using your same logic. Or is the Core project somehow immune to such corruption?

I'm not quite sure if you understand what BitcoinXT is then. It's just a slight variant of Bitcoin Core, and **the vast majority of bitcoin users do not even use Bitcoin Core**. No, it's not the same thing as directing people to dogecoin, unless dogecoin happened to be claiming to be bitcoin and using the same blockchain.... 
The non-savvy "consumers" you are protecting were never going to use Core anyways, and most of them probably will never use XT. What is it that your protecting again? Don't confuse Core for Bitcoin itself, it's just a github repo, and this is not @_date: 2015-08-19 15:36:24

@_date: 2015-08-19 23:10:34
So most miners have disabled fully validating their blocks, which is what caused the issue. I don't see how that means blocks are too big or better off kept small.. disabling verification is going to give a speed boost regardless of how long the processing takes... because it's disabled. Pretty sure even if blocks were limited to 200KB, miners would do the same thing.

@_date: 2015-08-04 22:47:56
That would be pointless. The whole point of counterparty is that you can create these custom assets. If they want to use counterparty but not use XCP (the token), they would just use counterparty and not XCP. There is no reason to clone the code but slightly tweak something so it's not compatible with everyone else using the protocol, or whatever else you are trying to get at. XCP is only used for a small handful of functions within the protocol, mostly as anti-spam for creating unique assets, and will be used to fuel smart contracts when they get released. Plenty of projects use counterparty, but don't make regular use of the XCP token besides creating their assets. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:10:01

@_date: 2017-11-17 18:45:22
Which decisions and what clients are you talking about specifically?
I supported S2X via reddit commentary and a website. S2X ended up failing spectacularly. I was wrong. Kinda sucks, but I can own up to that. Like I've said in other threads, if it fails then I've lost faith in legacy Bitcoin and no longer care about it as there are better alternatives. Which is true right now. 
*7 days later* oh look, you've got nothing to reply with as usual. Just empty assumptions you can never back up.
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:10:50

@_date: 2015-08-30 17:12:57
Simple dynamic limit has been suggested a few times already. The usual criticisms are:
* It's not predictable.. it's pretty handy to know what the upper limit is for bandwidth etc. that you will need to handle. Static 1MB limit makes this easy, BIP101 is pretty easy to, but any dynamic limit means that block sizes can be almost any size at any time. An easy fix is to just add in an upper hard limit on top, but then you are back to the question of "what if that isn't enough?" (i.e BIP100's 32MB cap)
* Miners could game it for some reason by mass spamming transactions to themselves over an extended period of time. IMHO that would be a pretty pointless attempt at an attack, but some people have mentioned it. 
* In general, anything dynamic could be potentially gamed
That being said, personally I would much prefer a dynamic limit like this than ones with miner voting like BIP100

We aren't talking about 20MB, or any of those other things you mentioned. And if everyone eventually agrees to any of them, yeah it is still bitcoin.

Can you clarify that some more? I'v been running nodes and actively developing in this space for a few years now, and while Bitcoin Core isn't exactly the most stable piece of software, there haven't been any issues or "destabilization" that have come up for me or anyone else that I have talked to due to the presence of "bloated blocks". What exactly is no longer stable which was before?

god damn man, you have seriously gone off the deep end. Can you please confirm that Bitcoin Core (specifically the version you and others work on in Github, and implementations which precisely follow everything that Core does) is the one and only true Bitcoin, and that we are not allowed to fork the dev team? You realize that the Bitcoin Core project has now become a central point of failure right?
Also, can you please provide some **real** evidence that explains how larger than 1MB blocks would effectively kill bitcoin, or cause extreme levels of centralization? And not just your anecdotes or your claims that the majority of transactions are in fact spam and must be stopped... also, I notice how whenever I ask you whether your main motive is stop all transactions that fit your personal definition of "spam" (via keeping blocks small, implementing relay blacklists etc.), you conveniently stop responding :)  Why not just admit it already?
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:41:39
See if you can export your private keys from QT (which you should be able to do even if it's not synced), and then there is an option somewhere in electrum to import individual keys separate from your main wallet seed. Note though that imported keys are not restored when just backing up from your electrum wallet seed, so you will need to back them up separately, or more preferably just send all the funds to another address where you don't have to worry about it. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:38:25
They probably assumed people already knew about the counterparty aspect, which yeah definitely a mistake on their part.

@_date: 2015-08-16 20:03:22


He started Viacoin, forked Counterparty, renamed it to "ClearingHouse" and raised 600 BTC selling premined coins, which he then partially spent on hiring Peter Todd to give his coin more legitimacy (err I mean.. "develop" treechains). From the looks of it, nobody uses viacoin for anything so I guess there isn't much more to  the story.
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:42:37
I'm not sure what you mean. Gavin said the average web page is around 2MB in size, and then Szabo made a smart ass remark in response about how you shouldn't store your money on the web. Nobody implied anything about centralized web wallets like mtgox, so he doesn't really make sense and is just trying to score cheap twitter points. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 04:17:55
Man, it is going to be glorious to look back a year from now on how ridiculous you sound right now. It's really hard to believe that you have actually been involved in bitcoin for such a long time, yet you believe that a majority of nodes and miners running a version of Bitcoin Core with some alternate patches set to bump up capacity is identical to creating an entire alt-coin and "tricking people" into adopting it. Amazing.
Screenshotting this :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:20:11


That's where your wrong. It was proposed openly on the main public mailing list just like many other proposals in the past.  
@_date: 2015-08-11 10:02:03
1) only hobbyists, developers and businesses run bitcoin nodes. Ever since wallets like Electrum, Mycelium, Breadwallet etc. (plus the various web wallets) came out, the average user **does not use Bitcoin Core and does not necessarily care what type of node it is or what specific modifcations were patched on to Bitcoin Core**. If you believe otherwise, you are seriously detached what is really going on. 
2) Bitcoin is ruled by a super majority. Thinking we can get 100% of the ecosystem to agree to any hard fork (unless it's an emergency bug fix) is just silly. Do you honestly think the bitcoin network will just keel over as soon as blocks reach over a couple MBs? What evidence do you have to support this, as opposed to the multiple tests and simulations done by various devs, showing the possibility of some real problems when mempool becomes permanently clogged, and how Bitcoin Core can easily handle blocks several times larger?
3) If your so interested in decentralization, why do you continue to maintain (at least on some level) control of bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org, some of the main information sources and communities for BTC... Do you not see how it is hypocritical  to promote decentralization while at the same time being a central point of influence (e.g, ability to censor)? If your getting tired of hearing people bitch about this point, perhaps you should give up some power.
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:05:14
Not literally nothing, but there was a point in time where only one person (or maybe a few..) knew about Bitcoin and it had zero users and zero miners etc.. just somebody coding away at their computer. I'd say that's close enough to nothing

@_date: 2017-11-05 18:56:14
Right now, bitcoin.com holds 1% of the global hash power. Right now, 83% of the global hash power is signalling that they will go ahead with the S2X hard fork. Since bitcoin.com doesn't want to mine on a dead chain, therefore they also plan on defaulting to S2X on fork-day.  If it looks like other miners are going to keep the old 1X chain alive, then they will open up options for mining both. 
Where do you see the problem exactly?
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:44:51

A question for those who continiously claim that Mike Hearn is somehow a "dictator":
What about Wladmir? He is the lead maintainer of the Bitcoin Core project and ultimately has the power to accept or reject any change he wants. Literally the exact same role that Mike has as maintainer of XT. In fact, he is probably less trustworthy since we know little to nothing of his history, motivations etc. since he is so quiet, as opposed to Mike who is pretty straight up about it (whether you agree with him or not).
Not only that, but Gavin also had the same "dictator" role up until only April last year, so to those of you always going off about "GavinCoin"... you've been using "GavinCoin" the whole time. Just a thought.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:20:59


What's your opinion of Blockstream?
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:27:17
If the fork is triggered that means that over 75% of the network is on board with the changes already and that everyone else has had plenty of warning to switch. Whatever is left of the old bitcoin network (if any at all) would be stuck with a still extremely high mining difficulty, but next to no mining network, meaning that transaction confirmations would get brutally long (adding even more incentive to just switch to XT or equivalent). Additionally all major wallets, services and exchanges will have already been switched over. Your kidding yourself if you think any exchange is going to risk becoming an arbitrage point where everyone is dumping their old-chain coins en-masse in an attempt to double their money. 
Do you personally run your own instance of Bitcoin Core, or what wallet do you prefer to use generally?
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:40:12
All of the SwapBots which sell the individual cards have a disclaimer saying you need a counterparty wallet. e.g on here  it says 


Anyways, if you have the private keys for the address which it did actually send to, then you can get your tokens no problem. 
If you create a wallet on  there is an option to import funds from a private key.

Miners want to make money and need to pay their bills. That means selling on an exchange usually, and makes no sense for an exchange to not be configured for the chain with the largest hash rate. Miners follow the exchanges and exchanges follow the miners.. Along with everyone else. Don't forget that if a fork occurs, its because over 75% of the mining network has moved over already, and since there is an extra 2 week waiting period where it has to stay above 75, most likely would be much more since everyone has plenty of warning.  That also means the old chain is left in the dust but with a still super high difficulty, meaning very long confirmation times and possibly several months or more before the difficulty finally adjusts low enough to accommodate the remaining miners. Meanwhile any decent sized mining pool could hop over to the old network and pull a 51% attack. Plus, with most or all payment processors and bitcoin services switched over to the new majority, where exactly will you use your 1mb coins?
As far as exchanges selling "XTCoins" and "CoreCoins", whoever does that is going to get dumped on so hard, it would be chaos. Will be interesting to see if anyone attempts it, would be a dumb move though imo. 
Tl;Dr incentives

@_date: 2015-08-19 20:53:52
So basically blocks were taking too long to process, so they just timed out, causing miners to ignore them?
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:56:07
Both sides do it sure. But I don't really see that particular statement as very political. If S2X wins, it will be the new BTC. A 1% hash power pool should go with what the rest of the majority is doing otherwise risk losing money from invalid or orphaned blocks. If the 1X chain manages to survive, they will enable mining on both chains. Seems pretty simple and reasonable to me. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 08:56:44
I don't see why it shouldn't all be on the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin has the highest security and the most users, using anything else naturally means less security and a smaller user base. As long as transaction fees stay reasonably low (like 10 cents or less), then BTC will almost always make the most sense. 
Also you can have lots of tokens registered on the blockchain, but you don't necessarily have to have them causing boat loads of transactions. For instance the concept of "Token Controlled Access" uses no transactions, only signed messages, so you can do all kinds of stuff just by simply holding the token in a wallet. Things like payment channels can also be implemented
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:20:45
He could do that, but it would be probably the biggest shitstorm bitcoin community has ever seen. Would be entertaining as hell and maybe even good idea for the long term, but I don't think Gavin wants to deal with it and be the lightning rod lol.

@_date: 2015-08-16 19:08:48
There is no such thing as XTCoin for one, nor will there ever be two competing chains working on different exchanges and services etc... that's not any of this works at all. I'm guessing your not a developer?
@_date: 2015-08-28 17:27:39
Pretty sure there is some sort of threshold where either you are paying too cheap and end up with a shitty result, or your paying way too much and also ending with a shitty result. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:59:02


I think this is one thing that really needs to be emphasised and put into action. If you can really cater strongly to the developer community than XT will be a no-brainer for any project to use and I wouldn't be surprised if Core started to wither away. 
Think about it - regular users of bitcoin do not use Bitcoin Core or run their own node or anything like that. The vast majority use SPV or web wallets etc... the main group of people left still using Core are the  application developers and businesses relying on it because they need direct blockchain access. 
There is a ton of stuff which can be improved in Core, and not even neccesarily anything protocol changing, just software improvements. Lots of stability stuff (e.g it's kind of stupid that it will just use up more and more memory until it dies), more and improved RPC commands, better ways to manage fees, relay policies and things like proper double spend detection. Yes there is still plenty of activity on the Bitcoin Core github, but they are still way too conservative on stuff, too slow and are hostile to anyone outside of their little clique. Try suggesting a feature or improvement to Maxwell and he will babble on for 15 paragraphs about why your wrong, ignore or shrug off your arguments and then conclude that there is no problem and bitcoin is working perfectly fine and as intended (hyperbole somewhat, but that's the impression).
Anyway, looking forward to see how this plays out.
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:16:58
Not exactly. If XT is successful then eventually Core will have to adopt the same protocol changes, or else *they* would be the alt-coin, or just be obsolete and used by no one. If they decide to go the alt-coin route, they would also most likely need to do yet another hard fork to artificially lower the mining difficulty, since nearly all miners would have left for the newer chain, requiring a new mining network to be built up. 
As far as specific devs go, anyone working on Core is free to work on XT as well or vice versa. The main difference is that the people who get to decide what changes are actually published/committed are not the same, except for Gavin.

Counterparty is the only "2.0" project with any real traction, plus it's built on the bitcoin blockchain. Kind of hard not to talk about it
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:40:03


You know that if you increase the current bitcoin transaction volume by 100X right now at current mining rates and prices, that "cost per transaction" would be 100X less right? It's a completely meaningless statistic, there is no $10 being spent by anyone (or even collectively by the network) each time you make a transaction. If every block mined only contained 1 transaction, at current prices, the "cost per transaction" would be over $7,000. The number of transactions and the amount of money spent on securing the network have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Really wish blockchain.info would just get rid of that stat already, or at least rename it...
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:02:38
Yeah that's true, not a situation that I have ever run into though. Could you give an example of how that might accidentally occur? Isn't transaction malleability more of an issue when a user has some sort of control or say in the transaction creation, and able to change the ID on you?  
Also I am not sure how much that effects this use case actually. Before every transaction is created, it does a listunspent command to get the UTXOs to use for the new transaction, it doesn't just save the first TX ID and then chain off of it or anything like that, looks it up fresh each time. Plus transactions are sent out in timed batches, so sending 1,000 transactions is actually spread out over like 3 or 4 hours. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:36:42
No, you just happen to keep posting lame twitter quotes here. Am I getting on your nerves?

The problem is there is article after article and years of debate about why yes it is obvious that this change needs to happen. There is hardly anything on the opposite side explaining how it doesn't need to happen besides pretending a large percentage of transactions don't exist. 


Oh, so they are just trolling him over a sound bite. Gotcha.

If 10% want to stay on the old 1MB chain and be their own network ("Bitcoin Classic") then sure why not. What's your point?
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:27:24
Yeah, I meant it rhetorically. I'm just saying that so far transaction volume hasn't correlated very much with the price increasing, and the "cost per transaction" stat isn't particularly useful. . But then again things could be a lot different when we start doing millions of transactions a day instead of only 100,000

Your using todays prices for figures 10 years down the road, so that doesn't really work at all. How much was 1TB 10 years ago? Also we are already at a point where 99% of bitcoin users do not run their own nodes - nodes are run by businesses, not consumers. 


(some of us) want a large percentage of the world to use bitcoin, and 32MB per block (160 transactions per second) probably isn't enough?

Interesting development. Isn't this more symbolic than anything though, since BIP100 (AFAIK) has not been implemented anywhere yet, nor received a green light from the rest of the Core devs (which by their definition makes this "contentious")? 
Also from the bitcointalk thread:


Not sure what "without even proper consensus" means (if the fork happens - it's *because* there is a majority consensus...). But if the real issue is being afraid of Mike &amp; Gavin reviewing pull requests instead of Maxwell and friends, why not just support BIP101 integration into Core and avoid the whole XT thing? Also saying it is "giving control" is a bit silly - if you don't like the other changes, you can just run the bigblocks-only branch, or just patch BIP101 into Core yourself, or heck even use an entirely different implementation. Nobody is forcing you to run every piece of code that Hearn approves of. 
Also from that same thread:


Forgetting about the centralization comment for a second ^(* cough * Core devs * cough * Thermos controls two of the main communication channels * cough *) - blacklisting IPs and de-prioritizing Tor IP addresses in the case of a DDoS attack (which usually happens through Tor) is not the same thing. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:45:44
I actually might know what is going on there (can't tell for sure without seeing a transaction ID though).
Basically, in the Counterparty community we have a few projects which are using an automated token distributor to pay people. In particular, the LTBCoin and FoldingCoin projects (both of which have been sending distributions out today). In Counterparty, if you want to send multiple transactions to multiple people, those all have to be their own separate individual transactions, there is no "sendmany" command (would be too much extra data to fit in one bitcoin transaction). The solution to this is essentially a script that lets you do a single deposit, give it a spreadsheet and then it automatically sends out batches of counterparty transactions, chaining together each transaction one after another very similar to OPs graphic. For instance, you can see a shit ton of LTBCOIN transactions today from the same address here: 
Some people might consider that spammy, but meh.. it's legit actually, no one is receiving transactions that hasn't specifically signed up for them
@_date: 2015-08-04 22:24:21

Wonderful contribution to the conversation Peter. How about letting the noob know what will actually happen, which is pretty much nothing? I'm going to take a wild guess and say does not run their own Bitcoin Core node or use Core as their wallet. More likely using something like Mycelium or maybe blockchain.info, in which case he has nothing to worry about, just sit back and enjoy the drama!
If you do happen to run your own Bitcoin Core node, then you will need to eventually migrate over to XT before the new rules kick in (after Jan 2016, AFTER 75% of the network has already switched over, and also after an additional 2 week grace period). 
No, you will not have "2 BTC in Core and 2 BTC in XT". Well, I guess sort of technically, but you would need to specifically be running both a Core node and an XT node simultaneously, and even then, only after the blockchain has actually split (which means over 75% of the network is already using XT or equivalent protocol implementation). 
Please stop with the bullshit Peter, you are making yourself look worse by the day.

Yeah that's true, mining fees will always price out certain types of transactions and give an incentive to not have absolutely every transaction on the blockchain. Which is fine, fees are good and a limit is fine, but a 1MB limit is way too small for the long term. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:15:35
Yup totally. However and friends do not believe there is any possibility for any alt-coin to gain traction and eventually overtake bitcoin, so they think they can piss all over the protocol and expect people to just take it.

@_date: 2015-08-25 03:57:49
75% is so one or two large mining pools are unable to veto the whole thing just because they feel like being stubborn. Also it is highly unlikely to be exactly 75%, most likely 80 or 90% on board by the time the fork triggers

OP is bluffing. For one, mempools have barely changed in the past hour since this has "begun" (multiple sources showing &lt; 1000). For another, OP is saying "the best way to take part" is to gamble more and donate more... if they were serious, they would be writing scripts to generate 10's of thousands of transactions, like what the last guys were doing. At most you might be able to get a few thousand extra transactions happening by rallying but that is peanuts if you are trying to create 1 GB worth of transactions.

If your a miner or happen to run your own nodes (I'm guessing you are neither), then you will have to upgrade at some point. For everyone else, no need to do anything. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 22:31:32
Other than paying people less often (ltbcoin gets sent out once a week), not really, although one of the Counterparty protocol devs might be able to speak more to that. Apparantly it is technically possible to encode multiple sends in a single TX, but then you just get a bunch of really big transactions that cost way more in fees, instead of a bunch of normal size transactions paying smaller fees. Doesn't make a whole lot of difference either way TBH, other than the current method is easier and already implemented.  
It's actually not even that bad. The fees are not a concern for us and neither is the confirmation time (doesn't matter if it takes a whole day just to confirm, as long as it does eventually). The alternative would be to have a centralized web wallet where everybody just gets their coins/tokens instantly and can withdraw manually (but I think we all know how most of those turn out....). But yeah, if we are sending for example 1,500 transactions per week right now to 1,500 different users... if in a centralized web wallet system each of those users made an average of 1 withdrawal a week, then that equals out to the same amount of transactions being created anyways. The fees paid to push out all those transactions can be considered the cost of not needing to be responsible for user funds and not needing to maintain a float in a hot wallet. Well worth it for some use cases like ours IMO.
Even though I am a Counterparty guy, I will say that one advantage that Colored Coins, Coin Spark etc. have is that they are UTXO based, meaning that they function much more closely to regular bitcoin. e.g you can do things like send multiple types of tokens to multiple people in a single sendmany type transaction. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:21:32
If you want something for an internal system that lets you move around balances with no fees and is outside the blockchain... just use a local database. You can't re-assign BTC from one address to another without going through the blockchain. 
Actually, I believe Coinbase might offer something like this, not sure if it is totally no fees though, and it would only work for transferring between other Coinbase users... but then you also have to trust Coinbase. So I guess it depends on what you are doing exactly

@_date: 2015-08-29 16:25:21
Actually yeah it is a sound bite. Nowhere does it say on the XT website or github "hurr durr I'm a dictator guys". Yeah, it says "just so you know, Mike is the maintainer so therefore he has final say", which is effectively the same thing sure, but it's true for every github project. One person has control of the repository, and can accept or reject whatever they please, or assign others to accept commits on their behalf. Pretty simple stuff guys. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:57:40
None of those things you describe are going to happen. Bitcoin blockchain only forks if &gt; 75% of the network is running compatible versions, majority wins. Beyond that, XT is just an alternate client (and not the only alternate client either) which isn't held back by overly conservative and stuck up devs. If Mike decides to screw around we can always fork XT or Core into yet another version run by somebody else. The Core dev team could use a little competition. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:05:38
furthermore, I seriously doubt this attack is coming from a government or corporate entity. It's almost for sure some early adopter bitcoiner kid trying to test the limits of the system. If all of a sudden it costs like 20K just to fill up a single block, pretty sure that will eliminate any script kiddie or person with a bit of money that wants to cause some chaos. Sure, it might not be "that much more money" in the grand scheme of things, but $20K to fill up a single 10 minute block is far more than 99.99% of the general population can afford, which yeah leaves only government and corporations who can realistically afford a sustained attack... but at least those two entities are also usually hilariously incompetent, so it's a much preferable situation.

If you look back at threads from like 7+ months ago (around whenever blockstream got their $21 mill funding), several people were predicting shit this would happen, i.e blockstream trying to exert control of Bitcoin Core. Even though of course they will deny any possibility of a conflict of interest, but it's pretty obvious by their actions and the way they are handling this whole block size issue.

The barrier of entry to running full nodes is moreso that it is a huge pain in the ass, not about the 1mb limit specifically. It's slow, the interface sucks, it crashes easily and often, and it's a major resource hog. So, pretty much only the people that need it (devs and businesses) run it, while everyone else who are not as technical or don't have much patience use better wallets so that they can actually use bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:59:05

@_date: 2015-07-30 03:00:20
It's not set in stone since nothing has been deployed yet, but yeah AFAIK the plan is still for the block size code to become active on main-net sometime in January. Of course even after that date, it still won't become active until &gt; 75% of the network is on board, and IIRC there is also a 2 week grace period even after that happens before a &gt; 1MB block can be mined.

I fully admit to being biased. Here is some points though:
* XCP itself was created by [burning]( 2100 BTC, and almost [10,000 bitcoin addresses]( own some amount of XCP currently 
* [GEMZ]( - sold around 7 million units, raising $150,000 worth of BTC, as well as raising some VC money
* [SWARM]( raised over 1200 BTC in their crowdsale
* [SJCX (StorJ)]( raised over 900 BTC in their crowdsale
* [Spells of Genesis]( just launched their [crowdsale]( today, already over 300 BTC raised for their BITCRYSTALS token. Also several [blockchain based trading cards](
* [LTBCOIN]( (rewards coin for LTB) is held in nearly 5,000 wallets and there has been over 180,000 LTBCOIN transactions to date
* [FLDC]( ([FoldingCoin]( is held in nearly 4,000 wallets
* [OCTOPARTY]( used to be an alt-coin, but they decided to abandon their chain and become a counterparty asset instead
* [SCOTCOIN]( did the same thing as OCTOPARTY
* [Counterparty]( [has over]( 20,000 assets registered and nearly 300,000 transactions so far. Far more activity than the various colored coin flavours, coinspark, mastercoin/omnicoin etc..
* [Symbiont]( recently raised $1.2 million to build their smart securities platform (also see the OP of this thread). These are the guys who created Counterparty, and they have stated multiple times that they are dedicated to counterparty (although they have also stated they will be working with other protocols - but that's fine, there are trade offs and benefits for each system)
* At the recent [American Banker Digital Currency Conference]( Symbiont was one of the main sponsors, and representatives from symbiont/counterparty at three of the talks. Notice how there is no one from open assets or omnicoin etc.
* Lots of other projects which can be found [here](
* Several tokens which are redeemable for various goods and services, such as [pounds of coffee on the blockchain]( [those bitcoin keychain images you see everywhere]( [store credit on BitVPS]( [professional audio composition services]( and [more](
* There is already at least 3 startups focused on building infrastructure and applications for Counterparty, including [Vennd.io]( [CoinDaddy]( and of course my company [Tokenly]( Also, there is four wallet implementations ([[1]]( [[2]]( [[3]]( [[4]]( and two block explorers ([[1]]( [[2]]( as well as support on [BlockTrail](
* Keep in mind Counterparty has only been around for a year and a half.
Looking at the [Open Assets Directory]( I see a ton of obvious test/bogus assets. Small handful seem like they might actually be a real project, but as far as I can tell few have much of any activity (if at all). Are you able to point me to any Open Assets project with a highly active community, or one that has made (or raised) a lot of money? 
Yes, some big players like Overstock, NASDAQ etc. are "experimenting" with Color Coins/Open Assets, but so far we haven't seen much come out of it, so I wouldn't exactly call that gaining traction, in terms of people actually using it at least. It is also kind of the obvious choice for them to dip their toes into though - Open Assets is a lot less complex than Counterparty feature-wise, so it's less risk I guess... We will have to wait and see what happens, but so far counterparty appears to have the the largest userbase.

I really don't get why people even think this is that complicated. If you are going to accept 0-conf transactions, all you need to do is ask yourself "can the service I am providing be cancelled/reversed/suspended if a 0-conf double spend occurs?". If the answer is yes, then accepting 0-conf is not risky at all since you have all the power over what they are trying to pay for (e.g Reddit could easily just cancel your reddit gold if you double spend them, or if your transaction never confirms). If the answer is no, then just friggin' make them wait for one or more confirmations. Or better yet, let the customer know immediately when their payment is received, but just don't actually do anything until some confirmations hit. 
In the case of shapeshift, they took a calculated risk because to them the much smoother customer experience is worth more than losses from the occasional double spend. Obviously they want to minimize that risk as much as possible, but 0-conf will never be fundamentally 100% safe. It's sort of like how every single merchant accepting credit cards knows that there is risk and a very real chance that they will lose money from credit fraud, yet they accept credit cards anyways because the convenience is worthwhile.

Bitcoin core is not exactly user friendly and can be a huge pain in the ass to maintain and keep stable, not to mention is a resource hog.

The part that bugs me about this is how pre-emptive it feels. It's like they have already made up their mind on the block size debate ("nope, sorry guys never going to happen..."), and now because they control all the "official" sources of bitcoin information, they want to assert this view and push it on us even more. In reality bitcoin transactions are still exremely low fee (compared to literally every other payment mechanism out there), and still extremely fast even when looking at confirmation/clearing times (again, compared to other payment systems). Sure, the wording on the existing points on bitcoin.org could be improved, but taking them out completely to match their own personal views of what bitcoin should be or will be seems really stupid. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:41:53
The protocol doesn't care about the reason behind a transaction or what how big or small the values are, as long as it's all valid. What's the difference between a 0.0001 BTC transaction to buy a cup of coffee and a 0.0001 BTC transaction which happens to represent a transfer of  a few million $ worth of company stock, using something like color coins or counterparty? 
@_date: 2015-08-24 18:01:16
Almost all wallet providers don't take fees for themselves, transaction fees go to miners. And why would fees go up with bigger blocks? I think you've got that backwards.

The feature literally was just released in the latest version of Core, and also it disables some things like wallet functionality, transaction index, ability to be a full node etc... AFAIK there isn't much practical use for it yet, unless maybe you are building some application which only looks at the last X amount of blocks and care enough about your spare disk space. As the blockchain grows a lot larger though we will probably see pruning used more.

It isn't RIGHT NOW - it's like 6 months or so from now. Jan 2016 is the earliest the fork will happen, and afterwards there still needs to be over 75% of the network on board with the changes before anything can happen. The block size issue is also something thats been talked about for several years now. Gavin had even stated last october that bigger blocks were being planned for the near future

Don't accept 0-conf transactions irresponsibly on things that you don't have control over (e.g you should be able to just cancel their service or suspend their account or w/e if they screw ith you) or something that you have a remote chance of getting scammed with and you will be fine. Problem solved, no need for a 13 paragraph article. Instead of crippling the usability of bitcoin, we should teach people how to use it responsibly.
*edit* I wrote a more detailed argument in OPs comment section
@_date: 2015-07-24 16:19:37
sigh. No, it does not cost $10 in electricity to send a transaction, that statistic is incredibly misleading (and I don't even know where you got "to send one dollar's worth" from...that stat is per transaction, not per $ worth of BTC spent). It tells us nothing useful whatsoever. For one, why is it that (using the same calculation) hypothetically with the same levels of mining and the same price as today, if there were 1 million transactions per day instead of 100,000, that statistic would be telling us that it costs $1 per transaction instead of $10? If it is a "cost", why does it become lower with larger amounts rather than higher? Hell.. if bitcoin crashed to $1 a piece (meaning miners are making a measly $3,600 per day), yet for some reason (again, hypothetical) there was still the exact same amount of electricity pumped into mining and the same amount of transactions as today, then each bitcoin transaction would "cost" 3.6 cents, according to that statistic. Makes no sense at all. 
Answer: the number of transactions and the amount of money miners spend on electricity have absolutely nothing to do with each other. You are also not comparing the cost of securing the bitcoin network (running some nodes and some miners on the internet) to securing fiat payment systems (banks, data centres, call centres, security gaurds, armored trucks, ATMs, mass amount of credit fraud, producing physical cards and paper money + coins etc.)


Your confusing confirmation time with transaction time. Bitcoin and credit cards have roughly the same transaction time (iv seen bitcoin payments propagate faster than some credit card terminals take to say "approved" actually).. but the **confirmation time** is completely different. Bitcoin payments take on average 10 minutes to clear, be settled and guaranteed to be yours. Credit card transactions take anywhere from 30 - 60 days to do the exact same thing (you can get a chargeback and lose the money at any point). Similar deal with systems like PayPal, and things like cheques and wire transfers often take "3-5 business days" or more to clear, even though the transaction has already been sent. The hand full of bitcoin merchants out there that force people to wait for 6 confirmations before they do anything are frankly just doing it wrong.


Do you even bitcoin bro?
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:15:56
In theory, maybe - but we are not really seeing that at all in practice. For example price has been declining overall for well over a year now and yet several times recently  we have reached all time highs for daily transaction counts, and continue to reach all time highs for mining difficulty (which is the only stat we have really for estimating how much electricity is being used). How is the cost per transaction going down when the hashpower going into the network keeps going up, and the network keeps getting more and more use? 
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:38:44

To me, it just means anybody that uses bitcoin and anyone that is interested enough to talk about it. That includes people that hang out in or any of the other bitcoin/crypto related subs, as well as places like bitcointalk.org, letstalkbitcoin etc.. and also the IRC channels. If you use bitcoin or talk about bitcoin, you are part of the "greater community" whether you like it or not - IMO.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:12:31
Care to elaborate? Multiple exchanges, payment processors, wallet developers, miners (chinese miners representing &gt; 50% of network were the ones suggesting 8MB), several other bitcoin businesses and a large percentage of the general community are all in favour of increasing the block size sooner than later. Most of the bitcoin core developers have all stated they at least believe the block size should *eventually* increase (including Adam Back and Greg Maxwell), just no one can apparently agree when or how. A simple google search can lead you to quotes by Satoshi himself stating that the 1MB limit is meant to be temporary, and far more people are interested in Satoshi's original vision and thoughts for bitcoin than what maxwell and blockstream have to say about it. 
What will you do when your still on the old chain and suddenly there is hardly anywhere that you can spend or trade your bitcoin at, and all your transactions take way longer to confirm (assuming there is any 1MB miners left at all)? That's what's going to happen when Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockchain.info, OKCoin and many others upgrade their nodes - which they will. Every other exchange is going to follow suit as well unless they want to risk getting a huge amount of coins dumped on them from people attempting to double their money. 
I can tell you one thing: there is definitely not hundreds of millions of VC money and investment going into bitcoin just so we can have the network validate 1000 or so transactions every 10 minutes, and also definitely not so that we can all just rely on Lightning network or whatever other system blockstream develops. 
Good luck, I guess?

FTFY. The post almost word for word repeats points which you yourself have repeated multiple times on the mailing list. No kidding you like the comments and think they have merit..


Or maybe.. just maybe... it's because whoever did it signed it as  "Satoshi Nakamoto" and did it under an email which had been used by satoshi before, which would be kind of a huge deal if it's really him? Do you actually think people wouldnt be as interested if Mike didn't quote Satoshi so often? (hint: tons of people quote satoshi all the time, has nothing to do with Mike)
Definitely some master level trolling though, I love it. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:38:04
And that is why typically you do not accept 0-conf on things you cannot easily reverse... also in general we need better mechanisms to detect and handle double spend attempts when they do occur (which sounds like BitPay is already doing according to OP)

Also keep in mind that 3 of the 5 people with commit access to the Core github repo are all *co-founders* (not just employees) of Blockstream. No open source project at this scale should have the majority of it's maintainers all working for the same company (let alone all be business partners).

Those 51% of nodes would stop using bitcoin and life would go on for the rest of the network. Bitcoin relies on &gt; 50% honest miners, it doesn't care about nodes so much. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 21:09:28
Well yeah, nobody is claiming that. The term "the web" doesn't refer to only port 80. e.g what about 443?
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:12:32
You guys are just pathetic with this stuff. This is an open source project, anyone is free to fork bitcoin core and create their own client versions as much as they want, and no one is expecting everyone to follow from one fork to another - it doesn't work like that. Some developers will leave and go to XT, some will stay on Core, others will work on both and new people may or may not join up on either one. Who cares? It's a preference in software, not a change in the whole BTC network (protocol changes need to be adopted by supermajority)... and It's not like the current group of developers are the only people in the world that can or want to work on bitcoin. And if changes in a fork of the reference client end up breaking consensus, then either they a) become an alt-coin, b) get back in line with consensus on the existing chain or c) convince the rest of the network to adopt their new version of consensus. What's wrong with a little competition? 
If Mike turns out to be some super nazi moderator trying to undermine bitcoin like what you are imagining him as, then the same kind of thing will happen and people will fork the code again and move to yet another client version, because that would be fucking retarded...
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:33:35
The way forks *should* be done is the XT way (minus all the sabotage from the opposition). Wait more a miner super majority to occur for at least a few weeks (e.g 75% support), followed by a grace period and then a scheduled flag-day to trigger it. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:24:24

Not exactly. Bitcoin is where most of the real users are right now and for the foreseeable future, as well as the easiest to on-board new people (and most secure, among other reasons). On the technical side, so far there just hasn't been anything we have built which has been more compelling to do via ethereum as opposed to bitcoin+counterparty. That may change in the future, and we plan on eventually being a connecting layer between protocols in order to take advantage of each of their strengths.

hahaha wow man your a joke. 


Oh, a thread by Derose with baseless accusations about "buying views" and other BS. I remember when Chris PM'd me to ask about this, since I had direct access to Adam's soundcloud at the time. I confirmed to him that he's an idiot and that's highly likely not to be the case. He agreed ,and also confirmed to me that on a couple occasions he bought views for his own podcast, which for some reason made him suspicious of others (projection). 
Think about it, for what purpose would Adam buy fake views for his podcast? To inflate numbers for sponsorships? If you actually listened to the podcast you would know there hasn't been a sponsor in ages, almost none since the early days of LTBCOIN (which failed to bring in advertisers, among other aspects). The network has not made any money whatsoever and been a totally volunteer project for at least 1.5 years, and has been self funded by Adam the whole time. Actually LTBN just recently got sold to BTC Media, so you can go ahead and bring your complaints and accusations to David Bailey. 
*edit* another point on this - if your buying fake views to inflate your numbers, less than 10K per podcast is hilariously pathetic and a waste of time. Nothing in your theory adds up.


Chris and Junseth went full retard and were trolling, which turned into outright spamming + random fake accusations. None of the real conversation was removed and everything is still available. We even unbanned them (or at least offered to). Cry me a river, do you eat up everything these guys say? And that is the one and only case over the past 3 years
As the top reply in your link says, "who cares?". You really destroyed my reputation with this one! (/s)

Me to. I don't remember jumping into this stuff full time in order to get a small piece of the measly 3 TX per second.

There isn't much that needs to be countered with UASF honestly. If people want to configure their nodes to drop out of the network after a certain date (thus no longer using bitcoin), that's their perogative. Network is not effected at all by nodes going online or offline.

@_date: 2015-07-02 18:49:07
heres a response that I wrote earlier 
Do you use bitcoin regularly? Have you ever built a service that accepts bitcoin, and actually gets used? Getting rid of the ability to accept a 0-conf transaction **completely kills the usability of bitcoin for most use cases**. People are impatient as hell, you are never going to achieve adoption if everyone is required to wait for at least 1 confirmation to do absolutely anything (blocks very frequently take 20–40 minutes +…). You should try experimenting with creating services on top of bitcoin in the real world before writing posts like this, acting like you know what’s best.
0-conf transactions are fine if you use them properly. Yes, they are “technically not safe at all”, we know that. We have all known that from the beginning, this isn’t a new revelation, and absolutely no one is considering them as good as 1 confirmation or more. It’s called risk management. Kind of like how you can buy things instantly with a credit card, even though the merchant knows there is a chance (MUCH higher chance than someone double spending you in bitcoin btw) that it will be a stolen card and reported fraudulent. The key is to use it responsibly, don’t act on a 0-conf unless you have some method of recourse, e.g being able to suspend a users’ account, revoke a license etc.
Consider the following use case: I’m a merchant selling alpaca socks online. A customer comes in and places their order, continues on to checkout and chooses the bitcoin option. They send the payment and then…. do they get a receipt and order confirmation as soon as the transaction is seen (i.e, 0-conf tx), or are they forced to sit on that page waiting and waiting until someone gets lucky enough to find a new block (and includes their TX)? Am I “accepting 0-conf transactions” for sending a receipt as soon as I see a payment? Why does that even matter when I am obviously not going to actually ship out any product before that transaction gets confirmed?
How about this use case as well: A user wants to register on a private, paid-access forum. They go to sign up and at the end of the process are presented with a bitcoin address + QR code to send their payment to. When they send that payment, do we complete their account registration immediately, or do we make them sit there and wait until a new block is found? Which do you think is a better user experience, and thus would be more successful? Why does it matter if they try and do a double spend, when their account could just be suspended? Double spend detection could even be easily automated
I’m not sure if you are new to bitcoin, but we already figured the trade offs of accepting or not accepting 0-conf transactions years ago. We already know that you cannot technically trust them, which is why you don’t use them in situations where you would end up losing money and have zero recourse.

What's that have to do with anything? The fact of the matter is if you are a business or individual using bitcoin, you have to transact on the majority chain, otherwise you are not a part of the network. If miners don't go along with UASF then all that happens is these nodes fork themselves  off and can no longer transact with the rest of the economy. How will your transaction be confirmed if there are no miners?

In that case they would be breaking the 'social contract' of bitcoin, which relies on 51%+ of miners being honest in that regard.

Not all proposals or decisions are equal. I get your point though.

Yes you have to download the entire blockchain. You also have to keep the node online all the time, otherwise you have to wait for it to sync every time you start it up. Furthermore, the Bitcoin Core wallet functionality is primitive and IMO not a very good wallet at all for personal usage.

So the big difference with LN/payment channels is that you can only receive as much coin as the other party has locked up. You can't add funds to a channel without closing and re-opening it, unlike a bank account.
Imagine your employer wants to pay you over LN. They pretty much have to have at least several months worth of wages locked into one or more channels - for every single employee. Maybe for a huge corporation that wouldn't be much of a problem, but for any medium - small sized business, that makes things a lot more difficult from a cash flow perspective.
Imagine you want to pay your landlord for rent over LN. Are you prepared to have 6 - 12 months + worth of rent locked up beforehand?

If you don't own a business or have never owned one, yeah I don't think you can speak very accurately in this regard. Especially when your assumption is that big businesses don't take risks (your idea of what risks are "unnecessary" is a matter of opinion). That sounds nice but not true at all. No risk no reward my friend.


Nope. And I don't think college degrees are relevant at all when it comes to computers. You can teach yourself with the Internet. 


Calm down. What's your logic behind "absolutely no need to take this risk"? 97% of the hash power is signalling for the S2X fork, Coinbase would be stupid *not to* take the risk and join the majority-fork.


lol there is lots of reasons, just not ones you are able to understand apparently.

No you don't but it certainly helps. Straw man.


Your idea of what is necessary or not is a matter of opinion.


Cool, good for them. Don't really care.


I think Coinbase can speak for themselves about what they think is necessary (which btw, they already have).


Hash power is king. This is basic Bitcoin 101. Users can't be users if there is no one to mine their transactions.


F2Pool is incredibly flip-floppy. Take whatever their current position is with a grain of salt.


Oh sorry, [94%]( right now my bad. 


Who mines those users' transactions? What software are those users using? The users (not just people on this subreddit) will follow wherever the economy goes.

No, the "better if they were much lower" is him trying to save face. Of course if you don't have to spend as much it would be better, nobody would ever disagree with that. The first part as well as Bruce's tweet he replied to (and there are several other examples of these guys saying similar things) shows that he thinks high fees aren't a big deal and he'd gladly pay them because he thinks bitcoin is merely "digital gold" only good for 'hodling' or for high value transactions.

Disguising the user agent is a good way to prevent the colossal DDoS attacks that XT, Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited all suffered. You know, those ones that took down the internet for entire neighborhoods. 


Get over yourself, it's a friggin' user agent, not a "trojan". You realize that when the fork triggers, legacy Core nodes will reject and ban all S2X nodes, regardless of the user agent string? It will look like they are relaying invalid blocks. Literally zero effect on the legacy network. And github repos do not need consensus lol...


hahahaha that's too good man. With all due respect, fuck your so-called "bitcoin experts".


Which corporation is taking over? Serious question. I've been asking people for days  now and the closest answer I've gotten is "NYA" - but that's just blog post signed by 50+ companies. Which one of them is taking over? Is it DCG?


True. That's fine though.


With 97% of miners gone, that difficulty isn't adjusting anytime soon buddy. If that 3% remains on the legacy chain, your looking at 1.5 *years* for the 1st adjustment (see [here]( Have fun with that!


If Bitcoin Core is such a great product, why does almost every single bitcoin business use other infrastructure (often built in-house) for just about everything except for downloading and validating blocks? 


Ah yes, the classic "stoners are stupid" argument based on me having 420 in my username. Never gets old.

Because BTC still has the most hash power, most users, majority economy and highest market cap. If there is eternal debate and stagnation over the 1MB limit, I don't expect that to last forever and frankly you shouldn't either.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:37:49
I don't think there is anything wrong with running your own full node,  more power to you and for a lot of cases it's a much better idea (e.g running a project that uses nodes you control instead of a third party API). I disagree with the statement that literally 100% of all users need to be running their own full nodes or else they are not real bitcoin users. It's not only unnecessary, but extremely unrealistic.

How do you measure community consensus though, or even developer consensus? If all it takes is a couple developers or a handful of people to make a fuss about any change, nothing gets done.


That's because to me your first post was agreeing with my statement but just in more words. You reject the proposed upgrade and would rather there be multiple competing coins. Do you disagree? Your position is perfectly valid.

Node support can be easily faked (or hidden). Most of the community does not run nodes.
What about developer consensus? And how about my point that if all it takes is a few people making a fuss, nothing gets done?
The only hard measure of consensus is hash power.

An agreement was made between a miner majority and a whole bunch of significant companies in the space. Segwit activated because of it (you can try to claim it was really UASF, but that's another topic), now here we are almost 3 months later and the same people (for the most part) intend on keeping their word. I'd rather they at least stick to their word and try it out, rather than getting cold feet because a bunch of the usual "never hard fork ever unless it's our idea" people on twitter are making a big fuss. 
What exactly are you worried about? If it succeeds, bitcoin gets double the daily tx capacity, and the scaling debate can settle down for at least a little while. It it doesn't, then the chain continues on as it is right now.

@_date: 2017-10-23 17:28:44




True, and so is yours.


Right, and I admit my comment oversimplified it. There are many aspects to security and decentralization. Having a lot of users is one of them, since naturally some % will become miners or node operators, and BTC in the hands of more people is a good thing. If it's not on-chain, not your bitcoin, only a promise. 


Well for one, that's not what I argued. And for another, maybe those node should get their shit together and upgrade so they don't end up on a dead chain (and if that ends up being the case, its very likely they will quickly switch.)


Can you really call an incredibly modest block size increase (1 -&gt; 2) 3 years in the making "reactionary"? When do you think it will ever be appropriate to do such a hard fork, if ever?
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:14:53
That's interesting. Can you tell me which other hard measure of consensus exists? Is it twitter polls? Pictures of people wearing hats?
Currently 86% hash power is signalling S2X. That's more than enough for a super majority, and technically you only need 51%.

Payment channels and LN are not as practical as you might think, especially in high fee environments. Check out this article 
I fully disagree with the premise that bigger blocks inherently result in a less secure, less decentralized blockchain that is easier to control. In fact I'd argue the opposite, as a chain with a low cap on tx capacity has no chance of gaining true mass adoption, and more direct bitcoin users = more decentralized.

It's the amount of inputs used + outputs created. Both can vary in size, but your typical "standard" transaction has inputs that are about 181 bytes, and outputs of 34 bytes. Typically you would use at least 1 input and create two outputs (recipient + change back to yourself). How many inputs you need to use depends on how much  BTC you are sending and what amounts you have received in previous individual transactions.

sustaining a huge transaction volume becomes harder and harder the longer you take the sample size for your average (and average volume might not suffice, it could be based on bitcoin days destroyed or something). e.g who is willing to put up a spam attack for an entire 6 months? And if they did, they better be good at blending in with normal traffic because otherwise their transactions could just be ignored from most mempools and rarely mined (like what we are already starting to see with the latest supposed stress test). 
Manipulating the block size via mass transaction spam is not only time consuming, expensive, and easy for others to notice and probably figure out who is behind it... but the pay offs are pretty questionable. How does someone profit from forcing the block size higher then it needs to be? Just because the block size limit is 2MB instead of 1MB does not mean that suddenly there is twice as many legitimate fee paying transactions, especially when the reason the limit went up is because you made 1 million  spam transactions to yourself... and don't forget that fees are a tiny portion of a miners income and will be for another 10 years. Also, each size change in BIP100 can only be +/- 20%, so changing the limit any significant amount would be a multi-year endeavour.
@_date: 2015-09-05 03:24:50
There is actually some evidence that bitcoin related web traffic correlates pretty closely with the price. At least that's what I've noticed on a few websites I run or have access to statistics.

@_date: 2015-09-03 17:46:10
Some improvements I like about it:
* 1MB floor, no possible shenanigans with e.g 10KB blocks or something silly like that
* Seems like the potential 21% attack is no longer doable
* 75% rule combined with the 95% rule is an interesting idea
I'm still pretty sceptical about giving voting power over a system rule to miners. IMO global settings like that should be controlled only by predictable algorithm and not by opinionated human decision every 3 months.. seems unnecessary. Dynamic limit based on actual transaction volume seems to me like it would be better, doing a sustained transaction spam attack for months on end to mess with the limit is probably less effective than coercing a small group of mining pool operators.. 
Other than that though, only thing I would like to see is an initial jump to 2MB or 4MB (keeping floor of 1MB is fine). I don't think anyone has really argued that a small 2X or 4X jump (relative to 8X or 20X+) couldn't be handled by most nodes, and it would be a good compromise with everyone that wants to see some increased capacity *now*. 
Also there is a concern that in X amount of years, 32MB will be the new 1MB and it will be painful block size debate round 2... I think it should be clear in the BIP that 32MB is not meant as a "absolute limit of the system forever and as sacred as the 21M coin limit" or anything like that (exaggerating a little, but some people have suggested that about the current 1MB limit). Something along the lines of "32MB is not meant as an absolute system limit, and at some point in the future we may need to re-assess whether to increase it further, get rid of it altogether, or some other solution"

theres also the time and risk factors. Its better to get BTC because it doesnt take 3-5 "business days" to process stuff, you can move it around much faster and easier than fiat and you don't have the risk of receiving a charge back a month or two down the line. Chargebacks in particular can end up as extra costs on the consumer because the business needs to be able to make up for any lost money when it inevitably happens.

In the bitcoin world we always just assume ASIC = bitcoin miner, probably because that is the first time a lot of us have even heard the  term ASIC. All it means is just a piece of hardware designed around a specific use, rather than something more general like a CPU or something. All kinds of electronic components for phones, satellites, GPS devices and other electronics are designed as ASICs. For example a chip in your phone that is designed specifically for recording voice/audio.

The conclusion that it's somehow better for the "community" or the "market" to make the decision via voting every 3 months sounds good, but really it's a terrible idea.

No global system configuration settings should be able to be effected by humans other than mining difficulty via having more hash rate.

Miners (especially the larger ones) can probably afford better hardware and higher bandwidth connections, whereas many node operators are small businesses and hobbyists, not to mention nodes don't receive any compensation like miners do. What makes you think that giving miners pure control over the limit is a good idea, and would not have the same or similar centralization pressures that you have been previously concerned about with ANY block size increase (more expensive to run a node = less nodes running = more centralization), since it would be in favour of only expensive operations running nodes? 
Also, if I read correctly, BIP100 only allows votes which are +/- 20% of the current limit, meaning in your example the votes would only be between 1.6MB and max 2.4MB.. seems like a pretty tiny range of choices, and if it tends to float somewhere in the middle, all your going to get is an increase from 2MB to 2.1MB. Very meh.
The more I think about it, the more needlessly complicated the whole persistent miner voting over arbitrary settings thing sounds, and I'm having a hard time believing that most miners will even give a damn IMHO. Or alternatively they will care *too* much and we will have to listen to the bullshit politics between both camps (increase limit vs restrict it) for the rest of bitcoins history. 
Interesting that introducing completely untested miner voting mechanics is apparently less contentious with the Core devs than just having a simple, predictable rate of growth...

We are already doing something a little bit similar to this over at [LTB]( actually. We have a system where when you "like" a forum post (soon to be replaced with more reddit style upvotes and downvotes), the "weight" of that like is dependant on how much LTBcoin you have versus the OP you are upvoting, and we check how much LTBcoin users have by having them submit bitcoin addresses and going through a one time "proof of ownership" process (send a donation from that address or sign a message). 
So for example, you might have User A with 500,000 LTBC who likes/upvotes a post of User B who also has 500K, in which case they just get 1 point... But if User A upvotes User C who only has 1,000 LTBC, then User C gets 10 points instead of 1. However, if User C upvotes User A who has way more coins than them, User A only gets 0.1 of a point. In our case, the points only currently effect the LTBcoin each person gets each week (more points you earn = more coins you get), but it could be easily adapted to actual voting on posts. This has the effect (in theory at least) of making it so you can get more coins by receiving upvotes from high ranking members / large token holders, but also diminishing returns as your coin stash grows over time, receiving less points per upvote but giving more.

There was no IPO, coins have always been given away for free, and it's not till fairly recently that you could even buy LTBCoin directly from LTB itself at all, and even then its just for convenience purposes (above market price and limited quantity, encouraging people to buy from others on the exchanges instead of us)

If each block is 8GB (8589934592 bytes) and there are on average 144 blocks found each day (1.1 TB data per day), and each bitcoin transaction is an average 350 bytes in size (it's been quoted as low as 250 bytes average)... then that gives us 40,904 transactions settled per second.
According to [Visa]( they can handle over 56,000 transactions per second. 
So, even at 8GB blocks that is still not enough to 100% replace Visa's transaction volume *today* (close though), but I have no idea where you get the 700GB figure from. That would be something like 3 million tx/s

I think the fall of Gox was the end of all that. My guess is that because so many people were using it as their regular wallet and there was so many speculators, everyone would just trade at a moments notice (i.e on any rumour or news story). Now that so many speculators have been burned and much fewer people actively hold BTC on exchanges, the effect seems to be pretty much gone.

gems, as in the "getgemz" messaging app? Gemz is a counterparty token, not an alt-coin. Furthermore in regards to the OP, counterparty tokens (which are built on bitcoin) have even less privacy than using bitcoin normally, since it essentially forces you to re-use addresses by design. It's address-account based instead of UTXO based like e.g Open Assets, which has some advantages and disadvantages - more difficult privacy being one of them. I wouldn't recommend paying your dealer in gemz..

Your assuming that things like TatianaCoin or LTBcoin are in any way attempting to be real world currencies competing with bitcoin. Tokens like these are essentially customer or audience engaging marketing gimicks, not your usual "my HybridFlex super blockchain is going to revolutionize the world!!" type alt-coins. 
Also these are Counterparty tokens which means anyone using TatianaCoin or whatever is also using bitcoin by necessity.
@_date: 2015-04-12 03:21:14
the alt-coin is just a method of taking peoples BTC, plus they were originally a btc mining company, the alt-coin nonsense only really got going at the end of last year. GAW also obtained BTC.com and has been actively trying to direct people away from bitcoin and into paycoin. how is it not relevant exactly, especially as opposed to many other articles that show up on the front page here which only briefly mention bitcoin, or don't even talk about bitcoin at all (e.g general world financial news)?

@_date: 2015-09-07 15:48:43
It's important to note that [LTBCOIN]( is not your usual alt-coin, which a lot of people seem to believe.
LTBCOIN is a [Counterparty]( token, built on the bitcoin blockchain. Any LTBCOIN transaction is inherently a bitcoin transaction, sends a small amount of BTC and pays a bitcoin miners fee. There is no separate blockchain and no LTB specific network of miners. It's all just metadata embedded in a series of transactions.
Counterparty tokens are also known as "user created assets". Colored coins are the same thing. These are somewhat centralized in their nature, because a single person creates an asset and decides it's properties, owner of that private key has the rights to issue new tokens (or lock issuance permanently), and asset owner can do a few other things like pay dividends and change the description. This also sets them apart from your standard bitcoin/litecoin/peercoin clone since it's not actually it's own decentralized network, just multiple user created tokens piggybacking off the bitcoin blockchain, issued by humans. 
So, LTBCOIN is just a community rewards token, it's not a "we think this should become the new world currency", it's more like "here's some funbux for playing on our website, thanks!" (opt-in btw). Tokens are issued on a fixed, [publicly available]( schedule for 5 years (we just entered year 2), and our distributed to community members once per week based on who participated the most or posted the best or the most content. We call this "Proof of Participation" (PoP), as opposed to Proof of Work. All tokens are given away, we have never directly sold any newly issued tokens (even the official LTBCOIN swapbot only sells tokens earned through content creation via the same PoP process)

When you construct a transaction, you have to put together enough utxos to pay for the outputs + the fee. If you want to be able to make several transactions over a short period of time (e.g 10 - 20 minutes), you either have to chain off of your unconfirmed tx (which can take even longer to confirm, and also opens you up to malleability, which breaks the chain).. or you need enough confirmed utxos available for all of it. I've noticed this in a few wallets (QT and Electrum mostly) where it will return errors after a couple transaction sends, and you have to wait until your previous ones confirm before it will work again. It is also a lot more noticeable when using meta protocols (color coins, counterparty), which allow you to have a ton of different tokens/assets but managed with only a small amount of BTC. The solution is usually to "prime" a bunch of utxos beforehand, by sending a transaction back to yourself with X amount of outputs, e.g this TX from last week  - 11 outputs created and then turned into 11 counterparty transactions all confirmed in the same block. 
So basically a well made wallet or any software that makes a lot of transactions, needs good UTXO management, IMHO. At least until malleability is 100% fixed, then you can chain unconfirmed transactions together all you want

Those things are all in your imagination. Bitcoin will be fine, there will be no "civil war" (lol come on man this is the internet), the price isn't going to crash because of it and development of the protocol and systems built on and around it will continue to progress. Maybe if everyone from Core becomes butthurt and quits bitcoin altogether then yeah things might slow down a bit (but eventually pick back up), but no one except for luke-jr has indicated they would do that.

Even if you paid a higher fee, depending on the size of the transaction it might still not have been enough. If you look at your transaction on a block explorer you should be able to see the total size (and the fee rate you paid). If you want it confirmed in a reasonable amount of time, your probably going to have to pay a rate of like 150 - 200 satoshis per byte currently. Unfortunately many wallets (QT especially) are complete garbage for estimating fees or even telling you how big your tx is. 
As for the transaction coming back after using -zapwallettxes, sounds like a node you are connected to keeps relaying them back? Not sure of the best way to handle that, I guess try connecting to different nodes.
PS: There is a better way now in bitcoind to drop a wallet transaction instead of rebooting. Use command ```abandontransaction &lt;txid&gt;```
@_date: 2015-11-30 15:40:00
Also, without any other efficiencies, 8Gb blocks can hold like 25 million transactions per block. Thats close to 50,000 tx per second, which IIRC is around visas level today. And thats just the on chain settlements
@_date: 2015-11-28 22:06:48
True, there's always more work though :)
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:46:22
A chain with only 6% hash rate would have an average block discovery time of nearly 3 hours (over 10x less blocks, which means way less daily tx capacity and also way less new coins minted). 10+ days just for the reward cooldown (minted coins can't be moved). The first difficulty adjustment would happen sometime after 240 days. See [here]( to calculate this for yourself. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:45:00
Dont you find it a bit ironic that you complain about being accused of being a "centrist", and then do the same thing to mike? He has specifically said several times now that bitcoin development needs to be decentralized by not being controlled by a single implementation (Core) and that he doesnt even want to be maintainer of XT. Nobody is arguing for protocol dev to be fully under mikes control.. We just want choices other than whatever maxwell and wladmir think is best. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:55:25
No way man. Downvoting means X amount of people ( and don't forget that reddit fudges the numbers) disagree or do not like your comment for whatever reasons, while upvoting means the opposite. That's how reddit works. It's not censorship especially since you can just either click the [+] icon or change your account settings to a higher threshold to read the comment. In fact, I usually make a point specifically to read downvoted posts, since sometimes I like to chime in, see what the fuss is about, or maybe even throw in an upvote if I actually agree despite what handfuls of others seem to think. I know I'm not alone with that. That's not something you can typically do for censored content. 
You know what IS censorship? Deleting posts so that **no one** can read them. There isn't really much more to it than that, it's a simple definition. Having an unpopular opinion be pushed down the page a bit does not mean that you are being censored - plus it's a group effort, there is no single "censor" trying to control the conversation, as opposed to e.g You have had probably as many highly upvoted posts as you have downvoted. Do you think it's still manipulation when you have a top rated post, or is it only manipulation if it's in the negatives? I can tell you right now that I'm just some dude speaking his mind on reddit, I'm not linking anyone to mine or your posts or managing multiple accounts to downvote you / upvote me etc. if that's what your implying. Or do you believe there is an army of bots following you on reddit downvoting everything (in which case how do you get high upvotes sometimes)?
Want to know what one of the big differences between and the XT sub is? On XT, we frequently have certain mods and other aggressive members coming over constantly throwing insults, or even just saying a bunch of stuff which most people there obviously don't agree with. Their posts are not deleted, and they are not even banned (AFAIK). Instead they are just downvoted and people provide their counter arguments or w/e... now on the other hand, no problem just banning people left and right, constantly deleting posts etc. all based on some rules they made up on the spot and apply selectively (read: that "trolls on notice" sticky thread that seems to have conveniently been taken down, or the other thread earlier where theymos announced discussion of XT is banned).
ANYWAYS. My point before was that you just thinking about it and writing a reddit comment (or twitter comment, pick your medium) does not constitute proof, IMHO. Backing up your "proof" by just stating that it's "extremely robust and simple" is a meaningless statement. Does having a PHD automatically make your arguments robust? Please elaborate. 
As for BIP101, it's what the author of the OP (Gavin) is pushing for and clearly referring to in the post, and so far it's the only blocksize BIP actually implemented in something that people can download and use RIGHT NOW. Unless you are referring to another BIP, then your extremely robust 1GB argument is just based on hypotheticals. Nobody including Mike and Gavin would think that 1GB blocks are anywhere close to reasonable at this point in time. But by the year 2030 (BIP101 schedule), pretty good chance it won't be too big of a deal...
One more question for you: you guys keep claiming that you are trying to compromise and work out a solution. Why is there such resistance for anything that Gavin suggests? BIP101 is fairly simple and very predictable, a lot of people including myself think it is a reasonable solution and in-line with other predictable aspects of bitcoin (e.g we know how many coins there will be in X amount of years). Why does it always seem to just be "fuck BIP101 we can't have that, something CIA something GavinHearnCoin" etc.  rather than "hey here are Y and Z aspects which could be improved and here are my reasons"..? Seems like everyone just wants their pet BIP to win, like your Twitter BIP (2mb, 4mb etc. over a few years), Jeff's BIP100 or the handful of others. Any thoughts on that?

If by full nodes you mean other miners which collectively represent &gt; 50% of the network, then yes.


Most of the BU hash rate still has the limit set to 1MB. Non-mining core nodes didn't reject it, the whole network did and for good reason. Do you still actually believe that incident was a low-key attempt to trigger a real hard fork?


Or in other words, they paid for it and moved on. Not the first time miners have screwed up and screwed themselves over. Why aren't you bringing up the March 2013 fork that was triggered by F2Pool (IIRC)? That was way worse than the bitcoin.com glitch

This part is what amazes me. There are zero options built in to bitcoind (which is the only fully validating node software AFAIK) for managing your mempool, limiting the mempool, filtering transactions etc. beyond just the mintxrelayfee option. It's not up to the end users, it's up to the developers of each implementation (Core in this case). 
example: 


There is no such choice available, no one has implemented a disk space based mempool. I guess probably thinks that every node operator should also be a C++ programmer, compiling their bitcoind nodes with a bunch of their own custom patches? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:22:09

It's actually quite basic. 10 minute average block time, 2016 block difficulty adjustment, 100 block reward cooldown etc... do the math for a chain split your self and you will come to the exact same numbers. 
Hash rate is king. Minority forks do not survive.

BIP100 isn't even implemented, tagging their blocks with it is only slightly more than them posting on forums saying "hey guys we think BIP100 is cool". Miners vote to give miners more power, not a big surprise there.
BIP101 on the other hand has actual code and roughly 10% of network nodes, but there is no point in miners showing their support for it until January.

You seem pretty confused about hard forks vs soft forks. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:40:58


Not really. You don't just spin up a few thousand nodes and call it a day. Random nodes don't really matter, besides the miners, it's the economic nodes and nodes behind the main infrastructure that count. 


Conflating a network hard fork with a 51% attack is disingenuous.


Wallets follow majority hash power, not whoever has the most full nodes set up.


Only if that majority also contains the majority hash rate. Or maybe the "economic majority", but you are basically asking businesses to play chicken with the network and/or temporarily shut down their services while they actively reject blocks from miners they don't like. 


I'm not saying nodes aren't important or not neccesary. I'm saying that they are a natural side effect of adoption and that node counts aren't much of an issue in reality. If you do think node counts are too low and that it's a problem, increase adoption and you will see that number go up. We can easily allow for greater on-chain adoption by simply increasing the block size limit.


The quote you gave describes how nodes follow majority hash power (the longest chain w/ most work).

Yeah, I felt pretty much the same way to. It was constantly showing people going on about how bitcoin "is the best technology evar!!" but from what I remember it gave about 0 reasons for why it's important and what problems it solves. They could have just included a talk from Andreas and be done with it.
I also have a suspicion that they purposely delayed the film so long because of the price/hype crash, hoping it would pick back up again so they could ride the hype train. They had originally finished the film around just after we peaked past $1000, there was a ridiculous amount of hype and half the people in this sub were completely convinced that bitcoin would be $2000, $4000 or even $10000+ by now. However a film mostly about the price and called "Rise and Rise" doesn't sound quite as good if the subject at hand is in the midst of massive fraud and over 60% price crash from the ATH just months later... and yeah you can see at the end of the show how they quickly tacked on and glanced over events such as the mtgox collapse, charlies arrest and the dorian nakamoto thing (which they shouldnt have even included really...the guy has had his face plastered enough places already). 
Another thing that pissed me off was how when they FINALLY released the damn thing to the public, the only obvious way to buy a copy was by paying with $, with the bitcoin option basically hidden on some totally different page.. and when you do get to the BTC option, it makes you wait an entire 6 confirmations for a friggin $30 digital movie copy ($30?!). Are they seriously concerned about someone 51%ing the network to reverse their $30 payment for a download, or do they just not know how to use BTC? I honestly wish I just pirated it instead.

Hmm... it's not well documented, the only clue I've been able to find is [here](


So it sounds like you have to use some combination of zapwallettxes and abandontransaction at the same time? I haven't actually used the new command in practice yet, but that seems kind of stupid if that's the case... 
Another but more complicated alternative you can try to get this transaction fixed is find the exact inputs used, create a raw transaction that double spends with higher fee, then broadcast the raw tx data using a totally different node or other service. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:56:59
Nobody is arguing that simply having some sort of working code automatically means it's secure, that's silly. Putting code into production and doing *real testing* on it is definitely a step above writing some hypothesises though.

Wait 3 weeks before you can send payments, great solution! By the time he would be able to send some payments, fees could easily go up even more, making the SW discounted tx nearly as expensive as a regular tx is right now.

Assuming full blocks all the time, 8mb would need 8x more space than 1mb... Sort of. The blockchain is an infinitely growing database, so all the block size does is limit how fast it can grow, but its going to grow regardless.

Can you please link to said evidence or ongoing research? I keep hearing about how there is all this evidence of these organized downvote brigades but no one has been able to really prove it beyond some anecdotes. I'm not saying they absolutely do not exist at all, but kinda funny people only complain about them when they're the ones getting downvoted, and no one else jumps in and says "hey that's funny I noticed that to". 


I browse reddit (particularly the various bitcoin subs) constantly, probably a lot more than you do. I have never seen that happen as far as I can remember. Maybe I'm just not looking at the right threads at the right time? Maybe I don't notice?


Yeah, those are annoying. Downvote, ignore and move on, those types are pretty obvious.


You can see what was moderated on bitcoin-dev also (there's another list). Does bitcoin.com for example publish things it moderates - it does have moderators, so the difference is not the principle.
Ok sure, one is more censorship-ey than the other (by a few orders of magnitude IMO). Perhaps a platform which does zero content/comment ranking and zero user moderation would be more preferable for you?
 &gt; Usually the trigger is that a trollish comment has a high vote, which probably means a better more balanced comment has been censored in reply.
That's a good point, another good reason for viewing downvoted comments is that there are actually solid replies hidden beneath. Trade offs of the reddit downvote system, it's not perfect. I might be wrong but I think sometimes downvoted comments are not collapsed if a child comment is highly upvoted? 
Also, there seems to be an attitude online (this sub in particular is famous for it, just ask that anyone which disagrees with you, upsets you for some reason or says something that doesn't fit your views is automatically a troll. Trolling is when people mess with you or try and piss you off for no other good reason than for their own entertainment. Sometimes things get heated and say rude things, and the mob loves their pitch forks.. but that doesn't make everyone who's given you the finger an automatic troll. 


If your going to get rid of voting, then you might as well just use a completely different platform. One compromise is to use the custom subreddit stylesheet to hide the vote counts, which helps with the groupthink aspect. Several subreddits already do this, like &gt; I thought disproof by counter-example is quite simple. Gavin says block-size does not make centralisation worse. I say doh, of course it does. Pick a number, any number that shows that excessively large blocks do make centralisation worse, and it's proven.
Maybe you aren't articulating that very well but it sounds like you are saying "pick a number that proves that I'm right, and therefore I'm right". That doesn't make any sense to me, saying your correct does not automatically make you correct. Also you are saying "excessively large blocks"... why would we want excessively large blocks? Is any number above 1MB excessive? Are you saying that a hypothetical 1GB block is just as excessive in 10 or 20 years as it is today? 20MB was suggested originally (along with some initial data to back it up), and everyone decided that was too much for *today's* network, so the compromise so far seems to be somewhere between 2 and 8MB for at least the next few years. Talking about any blocksize above that is pointless unless you are a) talking about sometime several years in the future and b) taking into considerations advancements in computing and internet speeds, efficiency improvements in the protocol etc.. 


Anyway I think arguments should stand on their merits not the claimed credentials of the person making them.
Fair enough, il admit that was a cheap shot. No comment on the BIPs I guess though.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:00:07

@_date: 2017-05-19 14:48:10


The full nodes that rejected those blocks happened to be a super majority of the mining network. That's why it never went anywhere (besides the fact it was a clear violation of the hard coded issuance schedule). Thanks for agreeing with me.


Bitcoin.com has only 4.5% hash rate, and had even less at the time of that incident. So again you agree with me, minority forks don't survive, you can't do anything without majority hash power. And again ignoring that this incident was accidental (it was like a few bytes over 1mb due to bad math, not due to trying to increase the block size limit). They paid for it and moved on, big deal.


Orphaned blocks happen all the time by themselves, business as usual.
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:59:16
Vast majority of bitcoin users do not run their own nodes. The block reward subsidy is still much higher than the fees collected, and there are also plenty of users out there that don't care about the drama and just want to send some money from A to B. Majority of miners will easily and gladly process those transactions. Some miners hoard their bitcoin instead of selling (banking on future price increases), and the others that do need to sell regularly can easily bypass the exchanges and deal with people directly through OTC trading (there is also demand out there for freshly minted, "clean" coins). 
Trying to extort the mining network won't be as easy as you think.  


Cool, that would be pretty dumb if remaining non-SW signalling miners post-activation get kicked off.  Not sure how that's relevant to UASF though, which specifically tries to force segwit activation by trying to coerce miners with orphaned blocks. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 17:49:21

I think at this point security difficulties for the average user are just a perception, mostly from people who don't actually use bitcoin, or maybe used it a few years ago. If you use any half decent modern HD wallet (Electrum, Mycelium etc.), it's insanely fast and simple to create and use backups, and keeping 12 words on some paper or w/e safe is trivial (have you ever stored any kind of personal and important document? ever heard of safes?). You pretty much never hear of any reports of Electrum users having their wallets compromised, waking up and seeing all their coins gone etc.. most of those stories seem to come from people using sites like blockchain.info
People also need to realize that there is such a thing as degrees of security, and not everyone needs the most hardcore secure setup possible. No, you probably don't actually need to create a one time clean linux installation on an air gapped machine, use physical dice to generate your keys, encrypt them, engrave the code into a metal disc and then cut that disc up into multiple pieces and store them in multiple maximum security vaults. If you want to be that intense about it, great, go right ahead. You can also use something like Coinbase where you don't even have the keys and they keep an eye on your transactions for any misbehavior... and everything in between.

Exactly. People act as if LN is a total replacement for bitcoin transactions - "we will just all switch to lightning, no problem!". From what I understand though, there is a fair amount of uses cases which are just not really possible with LN. e.g what if you don't want (or even have) BTC to lock up for potentially weeks at a time... or things like Counterparty, Factom, Proof of Existence etc. or maybe you actually do want a totally public audit trail (plenty of valid reasons for this). At the same time, there is a fair amount of use cases which you cannot do WITHOUT lightning (or similar), so there's that.  It will be a good tool to have, but people need to stop acting like it's the true solution to scaling.

Why exactly should a miner care if some random node rejects their blocks? That's your own problem. The main thing that matters to them is what other miners will accept. Not to mention that they use a separate network for relaying blocks, which makes this whole UASF thing even more pointless. 
Has anyone here or sister sub ever actually attempted to force-orphan blocks from a miner successfully?
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:18:01
You know how UASF works right? The gist of it is basically once the Aug 1st date arrives, your node will start rejecting any blocks from miners that are not specifically signalling for segwit. When you don't have majority hash power on the same page as you, you will be in the minority and therefore cause a network split, with you on the losing side. 
When you are on the minority chain, that means you can't transact with the rest of the network. Which means that Aug 1st Samourai wallet will effectively no longer be functional.

IMHO I don't think people even really know what they are afraid of lol. Seeing as how you can get 1TB harddrive for under $50 right now and disk space is getting more abundant every year, I don't think storage will ever be too much of a concern. Bandwidth moreso, but even then with one of my $20/mo servers, I have over 3TB in monthly bandwidth. Even my home connection with a measly 150GB per month can handle that no problem (might have to cut back on the netflix a bit). 
Consider also that 8MB means 8x more transactions can happen on the network, which means more users, more stuff happening, more money to be made, maybe even a higher price...

@_date: 2017-07-30 14:10:11


So...? Not sure your point there.


Your "bigger blocks" achieved by segwit also cause even more data to be added to the chain, resulting in a larger download. I don't get your point here either. Besides, right from the very beginning this project has been an infinitely growing database, that's kind of a big part of the whole idea. Go buy another harddrive, they are pretty cheap.
As for users being "unable to verify their transactions"... First off, there is no point in validating transactions you created yourself - you already know they are valid or invalid because you made them. The only thing you as a user care about in this regard is if received transactions from others are valid. These days, you definitely do not need to download the full blockchain in order to do that. That's just a redundant waste of time and bandwidth. 
This idea that everyone needs to run a full node or they are somehow not a "real" bitcoin user is so silly. It's not a realistic ideal whatsoever, not even close. The only reason to run a full node is if you are a miner, own a business or other blockchain project (faster, more secure and reliable to use your own nodes and systems instead of 3rd party APIs), or if you are a hobbyist.


In theory it does, but not from the get go (lots of people have to use it first in order for there to be any noticable effect). Based entirely on a hacky accounting trick as well.


Lol, no it quite literally is not. You've been duped into thinking that by months and months of astroturfing and groupthink.

In this instance, the Tokens are using the Counterparty protocol. Basically how it works is you can embed data on to the bitcoin blockchain declaring your token issuance (in english, pretty much saying "I declare that MYTOKEN now exists and has 1,000,000 units, with issuing rights given to address 13oJpctLmZurjyLQYmfjFRLppV5qEcuvhw"). Once issued, you can then send some amount of your tokens to any other bitcoin address by again embedding more data, or issue additional units, among a few other features you can do (such as decentralized token exchange). It costs a regular bitcoin transaction fee for every token transaction or issuance.

UASF is just a fancy method for auto-kicking yourself from the rest of the network, pretty funny that people around here are still trying to push for it. I don't see why any bitcoin accepting business with actual customers would want to effectively shut down payments to their own service in order to make some lame attempt at making miners lose money by orphaning blocks. Even more hilarious is that the attempted block orphaning won't even work, it's easily bypassed and most mining operations use a separate block relay network. Everyone still actually using bitcoin gets their txs confirmed no problem.
I do agree it should happen as soon as possible - for entertainment purposes :)
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:08:17
It's a game of chicken with the mining network. Basically "do what we say (activate our segregated witness hack) or we will reject any blocks you find". The funny thing about it though is it will do literally nothing (except cause people that are running it to kick themselves off the network). Miners use a different network for relaying blocks than regular bitcoin nodes...

Those are two very great arguments for removing the limit. $1.50 to send a single 256 byte bitcoin transaction right now thanks to fee manipulation attacks on the small 1mb limit. Thousands of users that have been waiting a week or more for their transactions to get confirmed, sometimes they never do and get dropped. Please tell me more though...


Nope. Which protocol changes were successfully forced onto the whole network without users' consent again?


A small minority tried to do this, and they were changing the distribution schedule which is supposed to be set in stone from the start. Horrible example and not even related at all to the block size issue (1mb limit was not supposed to be forever and was not as part of the initial rule set).

And you believe he does just because Maxwell hinted at it in an email and some reddit comments? So gullible. 
Even if it were true, honestly I don't even care at all, miners are going to optimize any way they can for their own self interest. That's how this has always worked. Various improvements or tricks to get double digit efficiency gains are not uncommon. This whole issue is overblown, and how come you aren't crying about the people that came up with Asicboost in the first place (hint: wasn't anyone in China).

There isn't any distinction there. Nodes don't arbitrarily create rules without miners also enforcing them. Moot point.

@_date: 2017-05-20 01:55:10


You pretty much just described the same thing except with different assumptions on what side will win. 
A few points though
1) Miners use a separate network to relay blocks between each other, your nodes rejecting them literally does nothing (except fork yourself off the main chain)
2) Minority forks do not survive, the incentives against them are too strong. 
3) Miners can hold on to coins for much much longer than an exchange for example can afford to shut down their services while playing their UASF game. They can also easily bypass exchanges by selling to people directly and using OTC (plenty of demand for freshly minted coins)

The value of each fee paid already goes up with the exchange rate, but right now it's being heavily compounded by a rise in the raw satoshis per byte required to make it into a block. Just months ago you could usually get a tx through reasonably fast for 60 satoshis per byte at &lt; $1000 per coin. Now it's closer to 400 satoshi per byte at $1750 per coin

True, I agree. However a lot of the time people will complain about bots upvoting/downvoting something, but only when it goes against their views. Refusing to believe that just maybe there is a group of redditors who agree with something different than them, so therefore it must be bots or sockpuppet accounts... the problem is that it is hard to prove, and it should be up to reddit's algorithm to prevent that kind of stuff. Although sometimes it is pretty obvious like when mods get huge amount of downvotes just because people are pissed off at them rather than something specific they just said (sometimes it's both I think though).

lol yeah ok then. The network already is decentralized, that's why it's so damn hard to change anything. You're rallying under luke-jr of all people in order to collectively abandon the past 8 years of network security that has been built -- it's straight up pathetic. All because folks like you are so gullible you actually think you are being held hostage by the industry that made bitcoin what it is today and keeps this network 100% operational. 
I think the reality here is that people seriously suggesting a PoW change simply want to be miners themselves. Missed out on the early days, now your jealous and following a pipe dream for a second opportunity.
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:33:27
The problem with your argument is that you are again just telling me "this is how it is", without really backing it up. Where are the numbers, code, reproducible tests,  research papers, etc.?
Not to make things personal, but your older than me, have formal education, are a well known cryptographer, came up with hashcash (ages ago), and recently raised more money for your company than myself, friends &amp; family have all ever earned in our lives combined. That does not mean that I recognize you as any sort of special authority over bitcoin. In fact, I see you as less of an authority on bitcoin knowledge than others because: AFAIK you have not really contributed any code to Core (hashcash doesn't count), you have not built any other open source bitcoin projects, you have never built and ran a bitcoin related service or business (besides blockstream, which hasn't really done anything tangible), it's highly unlikely that you even use bitcoin regularly at all (I use it daily and make my entire living from it), and finally relative to a lot of people here including myself, you are a newcomer to the space. Not trying to be a dick, but it's true.


This is silly. If they are conflicting, they are doing something wrong and you better believe there entire user base will be freaking out until they fix it and get back on the main chain. **You are vastly underestimating the power of network effect and people's ability to change software**. In the extremely unlikely scenario  of 50% of nodes being XT and 50% of nodes Core, and both try and introduce different consensus changes and actually activate them at points where no supermajority has been reached, then all the developers involved are retarded and the bitcoin community will engulf them with fiery rage. Core++ would then emerge shortly after, everyone would jump ship to the new compromise solution run by different people that are sane, and we would all move on with our lives (and on the longest chain). 


This is a good quote. So you are saying we should decentralize node implementations *^but ^have ^them ^use ^this ^one ^critical ^piece ^of ^code ^that ^my ^company ^happens ^to ^control ^development ^of.* Ok.
IMHO the bitcoin protocol is not a very good protocol if it cannot be implemented 100% independently and in different programming languages. libconsensus is great and all, not saying it shouldn't happen - but eventually there should be other implementations of it. 
You seem to think that it's inevitable that if anyone but Core calls the shots on consensus (rather then it being you know, a group effort) that there will be this crazy network split where suddenly no one can talk to each other, bitcoin crashes to 0 and we are all out of jobs. As I mentioned above, if someone falls out of line from the supermajority, it either gets fixed and they rejoin, or people leave and join one of the others so they can keep doing trade. Voice or exit.

Im assuming your basing that off of that one video where Patrick kinda-sorta mentioned they were open to working with other protocols, and then didn't elaborate at all further? Man you guys like to twist rumours...
They weren't let go, they left on their own accord to start a new company (Symbiont) which is aiming to tackle specific aspects of the same problems that Overstock is trying to do with Medici, and Overstock hired some new devs to work on that as well. It's also been confirmed already that Medici will still have Counterparty support (although they may or may not include other protocols in the mix).

It seems to me like he often tries and just stir up drama or make a big fuss over some  theoretical issue that no one has had to deal with yet, and then conveniently presents his own ideas as perfect solutions that need to happen NOW, but refuses to put them into real practice and prove them unless X or Y company hires him. Then they do hire him and he moves on to the next idea to sell. Basically a salesmen selling himself as a "top bitcoin expert" and ninja programmer that everyone must have... Quite an effective tactic actually, I'v seen more than a few cases of altcoin devs and some of these startup founders   bragging about how *they* hired peter todd to do some code review or "develop treechains" or whatever else, as if it somehow lends them some legitimacy. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 11:09:38
Or you know if bitcoind didnt just piss itself and crash everytime there is too big of a mempool, that would be good to. Its completely stupid that bitcoind doesnt let you set any sort of upper limit to prevent this (XT does though, go figure). And yet you guys wonder why the node count continues to drop...
Also if block size was increased all these transactions would have been ate up right away instead of forming a huge back log.

I guess my imagination is inconceivable because it seems pretty easy to me.
Current situation: Core pretty much dominates 90 - 99% of the market
Potential future situation: Core with 60%, XT with 40% market share
Potential future situation  Core, XT and maybe two other forks/implementations each with ~25% market share
Current situation result: 1 dude has veto power over all code changes, other 4 are afraid to upset him
Future result: diverse network, several teams need to work together and compromise in order to make changes to the protocol, users have real choices and can just switch software instead of hoping that current devs will come to their senses. 
In what stretch of imagination do you see situation  as being the  most decentralized? Unless Core goes completely rouge, there is simply no way that XT will totally replace it and become the new monopoly (which is good, we don't want monopolies). So yeah, this fear that mike is trying to do some sort of coupe and become literally Hitler is just silly.

Some reasons: you get the security of bitcoin, familiarity of bitcoin, plus any existing bitcoin address can hold tokens and potentially interact with them (if using a supporting wallet). Easier interoperability and less infrastructure needed (no miners, counterparty nodes don't even need to talk to eachother), again since it's piggybacking off of BTC network. Last I looked, the way Ethereum handles tokens was kind of messy, I think they are still figuring things out. Counterparty on the other hand has been in production for a few years now and a lot more battle tested (relatively). Additionally, creating smart contracts is kind of overkill when your just some non-technical dude who  wants to issue some funbux to reward his blog readers.

A typical counterparty transaction is only less than 300 bytes, e.g maybe slightly larger than your average tx. Part of which can be safely pruned if using OP_RETURN. The protocol reads the bitcoin blockchain and builds its own database out of that.

@_date: 2017-05-19 14:01:40
No, not really. Nodes are irrelevant without a mining network. If you get exchanges fully on the UASF train with minority or even no hash power at all...

The thing is, even if you did implement RBF, it's not actually going to increase your income by more than a very tiny fraction, even though they act like RBF would be something incredibly profitable to do. 
As of this moment, there has been 146 blocks mined past 24 hours with 25 BTC reward and 11.86 BTC collected in fees, which gives us an average of 0.081 BTC per block in TX fees. So transaction fees are currently only about 0.5% of a miners income... Let's skip ahead a few years and pretend that the block reward is now 12.5 BTC and average fees collected per block doubled to 0.162 due to higher tx volume etc... that's still only about 1% of the miners income.
Now, out of that small % of miners income that comes from transaction fees, how much do you think it would go up purely from people using/abusing the RBF feature? I would wager a very tiny fraction.. Plus, unless *every* miner adopted it then it still becomes a game of chance for whoever wants to mess with a 0-conf ("why does this friggin' undo button only work 5% of the time?!"). Nobody can use it effectively if no miners have adopted it, and no miners would adopt it if    nobody is using it effectively since there is no extra money to be made.. chicken and egg problem.
Of course, the block reward will continue to drop over time and TX fees will take a much larger role eventually. In roughly 2024/2025, the BTC reward will be 3.125 BTC per block, so we could easily see fees taking upwards of 5 - 15% of a miners income. Even then, RBF usage would only increase this very marginally, not really worth the fuss. **We have at least 10 years before transaction fees become a significant part of a miners income**. Don't you guys think we can come up with better solutions than this during that timeframe, and also that we should focus on immediate, real problems (such as scalability), as opposed to completely hypothetical scenarios 10+ years down the road? No one is even actually having any problems with 0-conf, it works fine when used appropriately..
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:59:42

Miners run nodes as part of their mining operations (or the pools do anyway) in order to fully validate the chain etc.
Economic nodes are nodes run by either individuals or businesses (more common) which frequently send and receive transactions directly.
Infrastructure nodes are those that are run by e.g block explorers, SPV wallet providers and payment processors. More or less the same as above.
"random nodes" are run by hobbyists which don't do a whole lot, or by people who have zero use for them other than signalling segwit/UASF support or whatever. At best they might help with transaction propagation, but other than that pretty pointless.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:50:10
Well ya if you use it in such a way that you can get scammed, then your right its a dumb thing to do and your asking to get burned (eg if you are an exchange). General rule of thumb is that if you cant cancel their service, cancel the product shipment or suspend their account etc... Make them wait a confirmation or 3. Otherwise you are just wasting your customers time for no good reason.

@_date: 2017-05-16 22:37:44
Yes it does. Transaction fee estimations are usually based on the average fees paid in recently mined blocks. If there is more block space available than it takes a larger amount of spam to push that number up, therefore costing more money. Pretty simple. 
Care to explain how small blocks help prevent fee manipulation instead?
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:11:51


It could also be made obvious with some education, not a Rube Goldberg machine.


It's pointless IMHO. It's a pre-planned discount to try and convince people to use it. Absolutely does not belong in the protocol. It should stand entirely on it's own merits.


Ok sure. As someone who runs several full nodes, it's a very minor cost of business and RAM and disk space is not something I'm rarely ever concerned about.


Makes blocks "bigger" via an accounting trick, and only when lots of people are using it. Otherwise no it doesn't really. Yes more improvement is already needed, hence why 2MB is coming in a few months. Or if that's prevented, it will be 8MB as people start switching over to BTC Cash. 


Sure. Segwit does nothing for this though. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:39:46
So you want mass adoption, but only LN can achieve that (which needs bigger blocks anyways), and bigger blocks are somehow bad because centralization. But actually you are cool with bigger blocks, but not BIP101 for some reason. Ok..
FYI the centralization pressure of needing slightly more powerful hardware or a better internet connection (most nodes already have all this covered), is quite likely pretty small. We are talking about going from ~6000 full nodes on the network to maybe going to ~5600 or something, I sincerely doubt node operators will be shutting down en masse. But that also doesn't account for the increased amount of business that can happen on chain, most likely resulting in more nodes coming online, so yeah.
What is the issue with BIP101, what can be improved about it, or is there a better solution altogether?

It's people just buying and selling for millions of different reasons, you will never be able to know the true motivations or be able to actually predict anything, so why bother? And why bother going around asking random internet strangers this, as if they have any fucking clue? Price goes up, price goes down.. such is life. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:24:51
Pretty simple. If I were to make my own minority fork of bitcoin with a different PoW, but advertised it to everyone as the "real bitcoin", that would be a scam, since I'd be trying to dupe people into buying my imposter coin. Bitcoin is the SHA256 Proof of Work coin btw, unless their is a fatal flaw in the algorithm (there isn't), there is no good justification for changing that, other than being a spoiled brat of course, or just plain gullible. 


Care to explain? Let me guess... something something ASICBOOST, something something Roger Ver (who owns a measly 3% of the hash rate)...?

Meh, I've been working with the Counterparty servers and it's codebase almost daily for almost an entire year now and this guy is way off base, I don't think he knows what he's doing. 
The API (and even the command line) is actually very easy to use and the API is pretty fast (I can get balance lists in fractions of a second, not the "15 minutes" that OP claims). 


All the basic commands for sending, checking balances and asset information etc. have barely changed at all since the early days, no idea what OP is talking about. The only major difference with newer versions in terms of the API is that you need to include a pubkey when sending a transaction.. not a big deal.


One of my personal servers hosts Bitcoind, Dogecoind, Litecoind AND a counterparty server all on a VPS with only 3GB of ram, costs me like 30 bucks a month. Runs totally fine. 


That's because you are not supposed to have your web applications use shell commands to interact with it, that's what the API is for.


Never have run into that error before, it generally actually tells you what happened if you look at the logs.
So, tl;dr OP doesn't know how to use the API and has had difficulties with installation and upgrades. To be fair, some of the recent upgrades were a huge pain in the ass to deal with though... All temporary problems

I was thinking about this a bit yesterday as well actually. What if say,  you could vote, and you could vote as many times as you want, but only the first one is ever counted (and some sort of crypto scheme to hide this fact). Or maybe instead of just the first vote, there would be some way you could specify "this is my real vote" in some secret manner. 
So for example if its time to vote and your boss at work gathers all the employees and says you have to vote a certain way or he will fire you or something... you could be right there, show him that you voted his way and it all looks totally legit and like you really voted.. but in reality beforehand or afterwards when you got home you put in the vote for what you actually want. The App or w/e would simply not save or record any voting data, so the intimidator is forced to have to just take your word for it.
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:45:43
If by technology you mean told people to sign up on counterwallet (which they had nothing to do with), sent them a bunch of voting tokens and told them to send said tokens to the address for whoever it is they want to vote for.... 
a) voting with tokens is actually a terrible idea, for a variety of reasons (vote anonymity, costs fees, have to make special tokens that end up being junk later on, have to wait on block confirms, among just a few issues). Its been tried a few times and it never works that well, so its kind of surprising that they still think "this is how you do it"
b) AFAIK they have burned through most of their 1000+ BTC that was raised last year, and with not a whole lot to show for it. Zero code available, their site doesnt do anything, and basically the only thing they have crowdfunded was some comic book. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 14:58:46

Nope, try again. Non-mining full nodes are needed for anyone that wants/needs direct access to the blockchain, i.e SPV wallet providers, exchanges, block explorers, thousands of other services out there. The more businesses that use bitcoin, the more nodes there will be (to a point - since many projects also just use third party APIs. But they would be less inclined to if the bitcoind API wasn't such garbage)
Miners of the backbone of the network though, don't know why this fact is being denied so much.

What risk exactly do your UASF nodes pose? Hint: nothing, and they never did. If you think you were ever able to force an orphaning of a block with your node, you would be wrong. For one, Miners use a entirely separate network for relaying blocks between themselves... not sure why no one mentions this.
Miners are also collectively enforcing segwit signalling right now anyway, so it doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:20:20
Also, what's up with everyones obsession with having a "whitepaper"? Seems like every single project has this as a requirement (even though its basically just a blog post / essay about what *their thing* is), but I have never seen this anywhere outside bitcoin...

You seem to be focused on "well, they didn't actually 100% confirm that it was going to use *XCP* (the token) specifically!!1", yet its been confirmed multiple times that medici is indeed making use of counterparty. The counterparty protocol is the important part, why does it even matter if they are using the XCP token or not? Also if they plan on doing anything involving the creation of non-numeric assets (the ones that cost XCP), then just by nature they would be using it anyways. Again, the token is not really the relevant part.

@_date: 2015-02-09 22:56:32
It's also not a matter of just sending two transactions and waiting 10 minutes or w/e to see which one confirms.. you can't just do that. You have to get the double spend tx both sent after the "legit"transaction AND propagated across the network faster, otherwise the majority of nodes will reject it. Transaction propagation happens *within seconds* and can be monitored - for instance mycelium has a "transaction confidence" thing that shows you an estimation of what % of the network has seen the transaction and accepted it into the mempool. 
It would be feasible to create a PoS system that accepts 0-conf near-instant transactions as long as a) the sending address has not been involved in a previous double spend attempt and b) transaction reaches at least 97% network propagation or something. If they don't meet those conditions then they need to wait for 1 confirmation. 
Also if going through a payment channel such as BitPay, they could easily offer cheap double spend insurance which would cover any of the rare (much more rare than credit fraud or counterfeits) successful attempts that are made.

Not even opinion, that is pretty much fact. There is zero evidence that tons of people were trying to move their wealth into BTC during the cyrpus fiasco... all just media hype. Maybe a few dozen or so people from there at most bought *some* bitcoin... but bitcoin was already rapidly rising in price for at least a month before the cyrpus news broke.
 I remember threads popped up during that time on about how it would be really cool if cyrpus officially adopted bitcoin, or that it could be really helpful to the people there... next thing you know everyone is (still!) going off about how cyprus was the sole reason for the large spike (well, it might have contributed to the hype, but thats about it)
  
Cyrpus thing happened in late march. BTC price had already tripled by mid feb from the december/january price
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:12:30


Uhh, yes they are, for the most part. Wallet software (or sometimes direct user input) determines what actual fees you pay. Whether that fee is accepted at all and how long it takes to be included in the blockchain however is up to individual miner policy as well as some luck. I suppose you can say that's where the market forces come in, but really it's all software anyway. 


It only "creates more space" through a hacky accounting trick. I see that as a trick, not an actual efficiency. Why not just increase the block size limit? Much simpler and more effective method for providing more capacity.


With a 1MB limit, there won't ever be extra available space. Unless BTC adoption starts going backwards.


The argument isn't "why shouldn't segwit have X%  special discount instead" - the argument is why should it at all? Why should 300 bytes of segwit transaction data split into two pieces somehow cost less than 300 bytes that exists as one? It's the same amount of data, and the part that they say you can "throw away to save resources" happens to be the most important part - the signature. You pay for the data you put onto the chain, period.
The article that you linked to explains that the discount is for incentivizing a reduction or minimization of the UTXO set. I more or less agree with that goal, but the problem I have with it in this instance is: A) the incentive only exists for segwit transactions. Does not apply to existing P2PK and P2SH/Multi-sig that the majority of the network currently uses. B) There already is an incentive to minimize UTXOs, it's just not obvious. Creating extra unnecessary outputs is relatively cheap at first, but it actually compounds your fees later on as those outputs are spent. There are other ways to manage this efficiently without some weird rule tied to a specific transaction format.

@_date: 2017-07-30 00:49:44
Surprised that you guys don't seem to know about this already, given how often segwit is pumped here over the past 1.5 years... There is an arbitrary 75% discount on segwit transactions which has the sole purpose of incentivizing segwit txs over the regular tx format, and allowing Blockstream to market it as something that will totally lower your transaction fees... 
The fact of the matter is, there is literally nothing about segwit that inherently makes it a cheaper transaction than others (the transactions are actually *bigger* in size than normal because it currently has to be wrapped inside a P2SH). The only thing that makes it cheaper is that predetermined 75% discount they decided to throw in. Somebody feel free to prove me wrong (and no, "but you can prune the signatures!" is not a valid answer or good reasoning). 
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:06:31
Replace-by-fee is a solution to a problem that no one is actually having. If your in a situation where you can potentially get scammed on a 0-conf double spend, maybe you should suck it up and wait for a block? It's not hard to imagine how you can use 0-conf perfectly safe (your never going to ship out products to somebody within an hour or so... that doesnt mean you can't give them a good customer experience though). Use your brains.

@_date: 2015-02-22 18:18:02
What happens if every payment processor, every major exchange, every major site and all the large mining pools are all on board with the new changes (as they most likely will be)? What about if the fork is introduced into the code but not set to activate for a year or two down the road, when most everybody has already had the upgrade in place for several versions? You know that the fork isn't just going to happen at random with no prior consensus achieved right? Your plan doesn't even make sense and is only going to result in your guys losing money and wasting your time. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:44:43
If replace-by-fee became standard and used by everyone, that would be one of the few situations where I would just give up on BTC entirely.. most likely go to an  alt which hasn't gone full retard. It would be a seriously terrible decision. I don't think I'm alone either.
It forces everyone in every situation to always wait for at least 1 confirmation no matter what, even though that is completely unnecessary a lot of the time.  Completely kills so many use cases of BTC and destroys any convenience it can have for pretty much anything (merchant payments online&amp;offline etc.) other than replacing wire transfers or maybe buying &amp; holding like gold I guess. 
IMHO it seems like over-engineering, trying to solve a problem which isn't even really a problem. Tell me again, who is out there experiencing frustration with people trying to double spend them? Oh yeah, pretty much  no one (or no one that actually knows what they are doing anyways). Most situations where you would want to use 0-conf transactions naturally prevent double spends from being effective, even if it's "technically feasible" to pull it off. For example buying something in person.. you are on camera, and they can discover you screwed them over before you even leave the parking lot. Or paying for something online - it's extremely trivial to suspend an account, revoke a service, or simply not ship a product if you see it didn't confirm later on. Why alienate a huge number of businesses and users just to try and stop the extremely rare instances that someone successfully pulls off a 0 conf double spend? Anyone that is actually concerned about that possibility is already waiting for 1 or more confirms anyways. 
Also, it's a stance that basically says "herp derp you shouldn't use bitcoin for these certain things because vague reasons".. very similar to luke &amp; friend's argument that nothing should ever be on the blockchain which isn't strictly their definitions of bitcoin and "financial" related data. How about you guys cut the "blockchain economic theory" and politics bullshit and focus on making this thing more usable and scalable?

@_date: 2015-02-22 17:12:10


I think you missed this bit:




Sure, those are great to. 


They let people withdraw funds before they made sure everything is confirmed, that's a risk they chose to take and they suffered the consequence. That's why you don't use 0-confs for certain things, like when people can turn around and withdraw what they just sent.
Nobody is saying that you should "rely" on 0-confs whatsoever or in every situation. What I'm saying is that you can safely accept them (keyword: accept, not rely) when used appropriately, and that we shouldn't have that ability taken away from us just because someone could use them incorrectly (e.g allowing withdrawals) and get burned. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:06:53
Sorry but no it's not. Speed for looking up old balances is more a matter of indexing, nothing to do with how much disk space your using.
Also, if you throw just *one* single signature away, you are no longer able to provide a copy of the blockchain to anyone else. How are they supposed to fully validate it if signatures are missing? If everyone is throwing signatures away, where the hell do I even download the chain in the first place? Perhaps a convenient link hosted on Blockstream.com? 
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:43:03
And of course there is always some risk you have to take. Just like somebody can walk into your store and just take stuff and walk out, why bother with the extra step of pretending to pay? Especially if your intention is to outright steal, rather than just having a % chance to maybe get something for free...
Either way it is still a *massive* improvement over the current situation where credit and identity fraud is rampant.

Sure no problem.
[Luke Dashjr]( Blockstream contractor (and also early co-founder), Core developer. Leading the UASF rally cries on a nearly full-time campaign across reddit, various IRC channels / chatrooms and a few other forums. Also the one that originally figured out how to turn segwit into a soft-fork.
 [[Samson Mow]( Chief Strategy officer of Blockstream. Also chief Twitter troll, spends all day long going on about either segwit or UASF and his 1 liners get upvoted here constantly. Guess it landed him a job at BS though... 
[Alex Bergeron]( Communications consultant for Blockstream. Similar public role as Samson but more reddit focused. [Bitcoin Core website and community / social media maintainer + contributor. Works or has worked closely with the above as well as other core devs, blockstreamers and associates etc.. known for lots of shady stuff which I won't get into right now (feel free to search). 
Other people directly from Blockstream that come to mind who've made public proclamations of support include [Matt Corrallo]( (co-founder), [Mark Friedenbach]( and [Rusty Russel]( [Adam Back]( (CEO) and [Greg Maxwell]( (CTO) both push segwit like the sky is falling and there's no tomorrow, and publicly toy with the UASF idea as well. I don't even know how Greg gets any real work at all done with the sheer amount of posts and replies he makes every day. 
These are all people that frequently are on the front page pushing segwit and more recently UASF, as well as some of the main points of reference and validation people use. All from the same company and on the same payroll (except maybe btcdrak). The same company that came up with segwit in the first place as a vital component in their Elements project. Zero conflict of interest and no pattern at all here, right?
For the "..and friends" category, you can include people such as Eric Lombrozo, Peter Todd and a few other devs from Core plus some of the mods. Then there is all the fanboys which just reguritate everything that all of the above tell them, and then there is the handfuls of recently created anonymous pro-UASF accounts that spam and troll both main subreddits + twitter.

That's not what I said at all. OP is threatening to A) organize a mass-orphaning of blocks for any miners that aren't signalling a feature built by the company he co-founded. Orphaned blocks = lost money. B) if that fails, the next threat is doing a change to the Proof of Work algorithm in an attempt to turn the hundreds of millions of $ in existing ASICs into expensive paper weights. Or in other words, "accept my companies feature request or I will try and destroy your business" (keyword *try*).
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:37:38
In what way are they better off "long term"? (edit: *crickets*..) I don't see how that makes any sense, especially how segwit is not only a temporary solution to the immediate capacity issues, but also promises to give an arbitrary discount on tx fees, making them less money! Not to mention that it's also wanted for implementing new off-chain tech, again taking fees away from miners.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:45:43
Just throw away the most important part of the transaction, what could go wrong?!
Sorry but no, that's stupid to me. First off, this isn't how it works right now (not automatically pruned, no one has implemented that AFAIK). Second, if disk usage and resources is a concern, you are vastly better off using the already existing "pruning mode" where you can choose how many recent blocks or GB of the blockchain you want to keep. Throwing away signatures is about the dumbest "efficiency" you can make. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:53:42
There already is an incentive for merging UTXOs, it's just not super obvious. 
The 75% discount incentive only applies to the single new transaction format that no one is using (not even on Litecoin where it's already activated) instead of the whole network, so that seems pretty pointless to me IMHO.
As for RAM... there is no reason that the full UTXO set needs to always hang around in memory, IIRC that's not even the case right now. For any serious mining operation.. who cares if they have to buy more RAM anyway? That's nothing to them, peanuts. Also having a large transaction backlog in the mempool (due to small blocks) is even worse for memory usage.

Some of these big operations can afford to do that though. Plus attacking the minority chain isn't about directly profiting from it (in the short term at least), it's about crushing a competing fork and keeping bitcoin as one chain. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:04:54
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:39:20
So all of the people most hardcore about no hard forks ever and never increasing the block size gather together and (ironically) collectively fork themselves off the network on Aug 1st and sell off all their majority-chain BTC. 
After such an epic fail and most of the small-blockers here making themselves completely irrelevant, what makes you think that miners and other major bitcoin businesses won't take the opportunity to finally initiate a true blocksize increase hard fork? 
BTW, any reduction in fees via segwit would be entirely negated by the fact your minority chain is slow as molasses. At 10% hash rate, less than 20 blocks per day found instead of ~144. Even if you manage to stuff each of those blocks with say 8000 small segwit transactions (probably would be way less than that usually), your looking at a 40%+ drop in daily transaction capacity. Much much worse than that if it turns out few people immediately switch to the new tx format. Smaller block size means more competition to get your tx confirmed, which means higher fees and even higher wait times. 
Please keep doing what your doing though with this UASF, it's great!

@_date: 2015-02-22 17:34:05
Yeah, because you don't even find out it's credit card fraud until possibly weeks or even months later. Plus double spending is far more difficult than credit fraud
@_date: 2013-10-18 00:33:25
Its risk vs reward really.
For an in person transaction, its pretty rare to have someone be ballsy enough to try and perform a double spend, to your face. Its not a good idea to force all of your customers to wait until one confirmation (sometimes happens almost right away, other times can takes upwards of an hour, depending on how long it takes to find a new block and wether or not your transaction will even be included in that one). When its only $10 or $20 bucks on the table, its alot better to just accept it as soon as you see it. Having more satisfied customers easily pays for the rare times (if they even happen) when somebody double spends you. 
Imagine BTC really takes off. Go to a restaurant and you want to pay with bitcoin.. and so do 5 or 6 other customers. Turns out this time was one of the odd times where it takes 30 - 45 minutes for the next block to be found, so next thing you know you have a crowd of impatient customers waiting for their payment to go through standing around for close to an hour. Thats bad.
Unless you are dealing with a major purchase, just take the damn transaction and cut your losses. The amount of people who know how to double spend and can pull it off in person is pretty negligible

something you left out is that miners on the minority chain will have a much harder time even getting their coins sold in the first place. Besides the really long confirmation times, at 10% hash rate takes an average of 1 full week for your mining reward to cool down and become spendable (versus majority chain where it still takes less than a day)

@_date: 2017-06-11 16:52:57


For individual users, no they won't go down. Even if everyone immediately switched to segwit, it wouldn't make much difference at this point. 75% discount off a $5 fee is still over $1, which is still way more than fees have been up until like 2 months ago. 
For miners, they get less fees overall than they would have if we simply got rid of or at least changed the 1MB limit. In theory anyway.
Try making a spreadsheet that compares on-chain transaction volumes for different block sizes against the current 1MB limit, and from there figure out how expensive each tx needs to be in order to fully replace the block reward subsidy in the near future. You will get some interesting results.


By "standard transaction", what I mean is the typical style of transaction that makes up the majority of the blockchain today. Addresses that start with "1" and simple transactions that go from A to B. Something that looks like [this](  Segwit is a different format which is wrapped up in yet another format (P2SH, addresses that start with "3") and given a magical 75% discount (that isn't enforceable btw, miners can determine fee priority however they want). 


When average fees and wait times and through the roof, and both businesses and users are being actively driven away... that's not a healthy fee system. A healthy fee system is one that strikes a balance between serving and growing the user base and keeping the mining network secure, while also staying competitive to legacy systems and alt-coins. 


What attack vector do you see with having some excess capacity? I see it as the opposite - constantly full blocks makes it ridiculously easy to spam the network to the point of disruption, flooding the mempool and even manipulating tx fee estimators.

a) Miners don't all necessarily sell their coins immediately. b) they don't actually need exchanges to sell those coins either. OTC trading is a thing still, and there is demand out there for freshly minted coins with no tx history. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:15:37


Giving a transaction format an arbitrary 75% discount and pushing as many transactions off-chain as possible, at the exclusion of any parallel on-chain scaling (i.e, block size increase)... yeah, miners get less fees than they would otherwise from simply processing larger volumes of standard transactions. 


You don't even know what your arguing...


Your the expert apparently, how about you go ahead and give that detailed explanation? Make sure you take note of the `minrelaytxfee` setting that every node uses. 


Lol no. There should almost always be excess capacity in order to easily absorb spikes in transaction volumes. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:56:06
fair enough. It all depends on how you are wanting to use them. In your case, have you checked out vault of satoshi? I havnt bought or sold with them yet, but I was able to get totally verified with them within a couple days, and their support staff seems pretty good. They only accept USD deposits for some reason, but they are actually based in toronto, and really just a matter of letting the bank teller know you want your cash deposit to them converted to US (I think they are with BMO). I believe they also convert back to CDN for you when you want to make a withdrawal.
Also doesnt hurt to check up on localbitcoins now and then, occasionaly you can find a good price. For instance, I typically earn my BTC and sell it, rather than buy then sell, so when I do sell its usually at or around current market price, and usually cheaper than other localbitcoin sellers.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:28:15
It's beautiful isn't it
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:30:45
Localbitcoins is the best way to go IMO. You may need to verify your identity if you want to use e-transfers, but many sellers will take cash deposits at the bank, no info required. I personally always use localbitcoins and have never had a transaction take more than a few hours, from time the trade is initiated to time money is in my bank, or bitcoins in my wallet. 
Id suggest just buying a small amount, like 50 bucks worth to begin with. Last thing you want is to drop 20 grand and end up making a rookie mistake and losing it. Remember, with bitcoin you are essentially your own bank, so you are responsible for your own security. Get a feel of how the whole thing works, sending and receiving transactions, making a wallet and making backups, using it on different services (like a small amount to a reputable gambling site or something).. etc. Also checkout  , its a very handy tool for tracking individual transactions and viewing network info/stats.
Dont bother with any of the web wallets, or at least dont keep any significant amount in any of them.  Get a bitcoin client installed on your computer.  is by far the easiest, takes less than 10 minutes to set up and be fully functional (if you download the official bitcoin client, you will end up waiting for days probably downloading the entire blockchain.. electrum connects to servers that already have it downloaded). Electrum is also really easy to backup, so thats nice.

@_date: 2017-06-05 14:15:05
The BIP148 chain can absolutely be "wiped out", don't kid yourself. It's just a standard 51% attack. If you have say 10% of the global hash rate, all it takes is one or two good sized pools against you and they can overwrite the chain with whatever transactions they want, or even 0 txs (besides miner rewards). Hash power can be directed towards blocks that you would still consider valid (i.e, segwit signalling and built off your chain) and simply not published until it's several blocks ahead. Then boom, all blocks in between fork day and the attack get replaced, everyones transactions reversed  and minority rouge miners lose all their money. 
The only way to avoid this is to either not fork with &lt; 51% or to change your Proof of Work algorithm (become an alt-coin).

Try again, maybe fourth time is a charm? I didn't say the act of activating segwit itself would suddenly destroy their business. I'm saying that OP is **threatening** to **try** to destroy their business if OP doesn't get his way. Trying to organize a mass orphaning of blocks against miners you don't like, or trying to change the Proof of Work algorithm to make their ASICs useless.... those have nothing to do with the technical activation of segwit, it's just threats being made if it **isn't** activated. Do you really not understand what the difference here is?

Ok, tell me if im getting this right.
So, your planning on running two versions of the client, one that stays on the &lt; 1 MB fork and one that runs on the &gt; 1 MB, but both holding the same wallets. Your then going to take all your coins on the &gt; 1 MB chain and dump them onto an exchange for cash. Then, your going to take that cash, put it into a different exchange which for some reason is using the &lt; 1MB fork instead, buy up as many coins as possible, then turn around and dump those on the &gt; 1MB exchange, rinse and repeat until one crashes and the other shoots up in price? Am I missing something there?

As for being "extremely conservative"... no, we are just calling out UASF for how stupid it is and how it's unlikely to work, but your more than welcome to keep trying. At this point, segwit zealots forking to their own alt-coin would be great and probably make things easier for the bigger-blocks movement. Pretty sure that sentiment is shared as well.

Compared to accepting paypal, which takes a cut, then another cut for exchanging to my local currency, and then another cut when withdrawing, which takes 3-5 *business* days.... And on the buying side, it has never taken me more than a couple hours to obtain whatever amount I need.

Nicely done, but I feel like it is missing alot of info for 2013, and some of it is just plain misleading.
The whole cyprus thing, there was already a huge hype train going for bitcoin and the price was already skyrocketting before that all happened. It was pretty much like "bitcoin is awesome.. hey now this crazy stuff is happening in cyprus, bitcoin would be perfect for these people!". Somehow that equals cyprus being main cause of bitcoin price surge
The "silk road crash" didnt even really happen. The price pretty much totally recovered literally the same day, so IMO that point wa snt significant (26,000 BTC seized definitely is though).

The fact of the matter is that both of the main bitcoin communities (and bitcointalk) are rife with trolls, spam/scams, manipulators (people posting shit trying to manipulate the price up/down) and new "investors" who have no idea what they are talking about and are only looking to get rich quick (and completely freaking out whenever the price fluctuates).

Im not sure what you could say to him to disprove his claims, but im pretty certian the police will do absolutely nothing for him, so unless he his threatening violence or something, you probably dont have much to worry about.
My guess is that he runs windows on his computer and its loaded with malware, one or more of which is actively looking for wallets, or access to a web wallet like blockchain (these are becoming more and more common). Or maybe he has compromised his own account some other way.
Either way, I cant think of any way that you could have hacked into his blockchain wallet while performing a simple transaction...
with bitcoin, you are essentially your own bank. With that comes alot of responsibility, namely with the fact that you need to be very careful with your money. Alot of people dont realize this and end up making stupid mistakes, which end up in them losing out on a good chunk of money

Well, for one thing, they would be totally retarded to sell off coins they bought at 500+ at ~100 unless they really needed the cash. Isnt the rule buy low sell high? If your going to waste away your money buy selling so much lower than you bought in, you mise well just keep them and see where it takes you, or spend them on products/services that arnt  priced in fiat (which isnt very much at the moment.. but it exists)
For another... its not like the amount of merchants and services using BTC goes up/down with the price.. do you really think that if the price were to go all the way back down to 100, all of the places who started accepting since its been 100+ would just sell off any coins they made and stop accepting any more?

Stupid though, I actually considered usng the site right up until I saw that notice, and thought "well thats stupid...". Im sure many others have done the same.
apparantly they are selling their "bitcoin bank script" for 59 BTC. Almost $8000 dollar for some probably terribly written software. You can essentially operate as your own bank just by running bitcoind on a server, so what exactly does their "script" accomplish? 
all in all seems shady as hell

Because they are all so incredibly short sighted and thought it would go up and up forever and they would get mega rich off of it. 
I also love how people are talking about suicide (okay, maybe just that one OP), freaking out claiming bitcoin is dead, game over etc.... even if BTC dropped all the way back down to ~ $100 (which is where it sat most of the year, up until like not even 2 months ago), we would still be up 1000% from this time last year and in a far far better position, much more well known.

I earn BTC and then sell on localbitcoins, anytime I put any up for sale, they are sold and money safely deposited into my bank within a few hours usually, definitely before the end of the day. Compared to getting paid via PayPal and then withdrawing to my bank (3-5 days at least, can be more if there is weekend or holiday in between, plus paying a pretty steep fee for just receiving the money and another one for exchanging to local currency).. its so much easier with bitcoin
plus you can sell on localbitcoins at a markup above exchange prices, so not only are you saving money from paypal fees, but your actually making MORE money than you would have otherwise
@_date: 2013-10-02 00:58:17
ya, I imagine the plastic bills are much much harder to counterfeit 
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:30:30
As a fellow developer, I agree completely. I typically just ignore any potential jobs or contact requests where they want to build the next big BTC exchange. I recently was referred to an ad where the guy wanted to build a social media site "with many features like facebook has". Ya.. right. Another one came in a while ago where they wanted a site that is basically facebook but totally anonymous, built in bitcoin wallet and a whole bunch of other features.
If you have a big idea for a website, but dont have a clue on how to program, be prepared to drop at the very least several thousand dollars. Even a relatively small site can take a good solid 30 - 60 hours + of work. So if you are trying to pay someone $400 to build a custom site for you, your basically paying them under $10 an hour to do something few people know how to do and much fewer are actually good at (and if they are good at it, they have likely invested several years into mastering it). Pretty cheapskate if you ask me.
 But then again when you are inexperienced freelancing, easy to get talked into doing those kinds of projects.

for the record, I do have a credit card and have for quite some time. The only reason I have it is for the ability to buy things online (no you can't use a debit card.. unless you bank specifically has them set up to work as a credit card). I absolutely do not have one because I want someone to watch all my transactions, or for the ability to charge back a merchant who ripped me off. And as for being able to deny charges that were fraudulent, those should never even have to happen to begin with.
As for the rest, sums it up pretty good :)

Seems to me that with banks, if you are involved in any sort of fraud (doesnt matter if you were the one that got scammed or not), you are basically going to be screwed with by the banks for a long time. I got scammed selling on localbitcoins once, and have been dealing with all kinds of bullshit from the bank (even though I closed my account and opened a new one) for over half a year now. No end in sight to, seems like every person I talk to tells me something different and passes me off to someone else who has no idea what they are doing

What about bitpay, bitmit and bitcoinstore? those are all fairly large and have nothing to do with gambling or drugs. Or the whole mining scene (ASIC Miner, various mining pools)... and a ton of money is made just at the exchange level (localbitcoins, mtgox, coinbase), and with investments, securities etc (havelock, mpex). I could go on
The gambling and black market side of bitcoin is definitely a substantial part of it all, but they are really just peices of the puzzle.

I got scammed on a email transfer selling btc when I was with rbc. They froze my account for 2 weeks, refused to release any of my money ( just before rent day to, go figure, and including existing funds unrelated to the transaction). They basically told me that I shouldn't be "making those kinds if transactions" and that I have to close my account after the 2 weeks. And they got me essentially black listed for interac e transfers so I can't even use it even with a different bank. Fuck rbc

@_date: 2013-12-19 02:10:43
your totally correct. Its a point that alot of people seem to miss. Personally I find it so much faster (and cheaper) to get BTC and sell it for cash than getting paid in something like paypal. Cash in the bank same day vs having to wait "3-5 business days" plus a hefty fee just for getting money.
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:27:59
Well, iv been scammed before and the bank didnt do jack shit for "insuring" my deposits or "protecting my assets from fraud". They dont give a shit if you lose your money, they only want to protect themselves from fraud. They can also freeze all of your finances at will, for as long as they want, for pretty much any reason (oh you just accepted several deposits in a short period of time which you dont usually do? Thats suspicious, no more money for you!).
Also, everyone running a bitcoin client is technically a "bitcoin bank". One of the main points of bitcoin is to be your own bank. If your trusting some random website to be your "bank" instead of doing it yourself, your just asking for trouble in this stage of the game. 
@_date: 2013-09-01 16:31:03
True. But at least with only your public bitcoin address, they cant run off and spend ALL of your money, only what you willingly sent to them.
@_date: 2013-09-10 01:00:56
there is no "real" value. The value is whatever someone is willing to sell it to you. Its just about trying to find the best deal
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:43:41
have you tried localbitcoins? Its seriously dead simple, you can get BTC within a couple hours tops by using interac e-transfers. You usually still have to send a copy of your ID (most sellers will verify pretty much instantly), and you might have to pay a bit of a premium on the price, but its by far the easiest and fastest way to get bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:22:30
Not too sure man sorry, hard to say. If you are wanting to use interac e-transfers then I think you pretty much have to be with one of the big banks though. Dont quote me on that. 
Best bet for a all round BTC friendly bank would probably be to approach a local credit union, and be open about it the whole time. Your never going to get anywhere with the huge corporate banks, they dont have a fucking clue about anything apparantly.
Personally, I havnt had any issues just taking straight up cash deposits. Still cant send/receive e-transfers, but fortunately still can by proxy with a friends account.. you just have to be really consistant with actually checking peoples IDs etc.
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:59:35

@_date: 2013-11-25 17:59:02
owner of EarnFreeBitcoins here. The gist of it is that advertisers pay x amount of bitcoin (usually very small amount) per visitor we show their site to. Visitors enter in their bitcoin address they want to receive earnings to, and then are shown random sponsored websites for a few minutes at a time. There is a timer when viewing websites, and once it reaches 0, you can click next to get your coin (keep in mind the amounts are like 0.000001 or even less sometimes. fractions of pennies, but people seem to love it). 
It used to be instant payouts, but due to the whole dust transaction thing (lost of tiny outputs of BTC that cost way more in transaction fees just to send then they are even worth), we had to change the system a little bit, so now you retain a small balance on the website. Once your balance reaches 0.000055 BTC, you are automatically added to the payout queue. Payments are usually sent every hour or couple hours.
We get a small portion of the revenue from each visit as profit, and a small income from the pay per click ads. Its not really a whole lot though and is mostly offset by the amount of transaction fees we pay.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:02:30
bitcoin is fundamentally different. You cant use gold to send equivalents of fractions of a penny up to millions/billions of dollars near instantly across the globe to anybody without permission.

couple reasons. Kind of all three lol. An experiment into making bitcoin websites, spread some more awareness and make a little bit of money off of it to boot. 
TBH, when I was first getting into BTC (and didnt really have any..), I was going to free bitcoin sites. I frequented bitvisitor for a while, but then started thinking "wow this looks really damn easy to make, and its really popular". So a couple weekends later, EarnFreeBitcoins was born :p

@_date: 2013-12-26 04:25:44
Exactly. If your very first thought upon getting some bitcoin is how you can convert it to cash asap, then your doing it wrong. At least for small amounts like mentioned by OP
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:31:20
If you wanted to, you could buy the exact amount you need, but it might be more practical to buy to buy at least a bit extra. Depends on the circumstance really.  And depending who/where you buy from, there may or may not be a minimum $ amount to purchase.
My scenario is generally the other way around, receiving BTC as payment and needing to convert it into cash. I typically use localbitcoins.com, no having to deal with exchange verifications and such, wiring money overseas etc. Pretty much whenever I get bitcoin, I can have it all sold on localbitcoins within a day or so, sometimes within a few hours, cash in the bank. No chunk taken off from paypal fees, wire fees etc., and best of all it can easily be sold at a good $5 - $20 (or more) above market price, per coin. 
 Which means not only am I saving on fees, but im actually making MORE money by selling it at above the current market price. And not to mention saving tons of time.
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:54:26

I think it would actually be easier from a technical standpoint than cash &gt; BTC. Taking cash and giving BTC means that you have to be able to detect if the cash is legitimate before accepting the money. BTC is much easier to verify.

Credit cards absolutely dominate the world of online payments,and they have been since e-commerce first started. Even with paypal, you generally need to have a credit card attached to your account. Have fun trying to buy anything at all online if you are unable to get a credit card (really bad credit, underaged, live in one of many countries where you cant just go get a mastercard.. etc.). 
Bitcoin is the new way to pay for things online. Maybe credit cards still have their place for, well.. credit. But bitcoin is definitely in competition with them for the online payments industry. 
Why would I purchase an item online with a credit card, costing me absurd fees, opening me up to credit card/identity fraud (ANY site that takes credit card numbers could easily save your information without you knowing, and it happens constantly) and racking up my balance with the CC company, costing me 19% + in interest if its not all paid off? From the sellers view.. why would I accept credit cards when I have to pay fees just to accept the damn money, and there is a hugely prominent risk of chargeback fraud, causing me to lose the money and the product/service im offering? When you really think about it, credit cards are a fucking terrible and insecure way to pay for things on the internet. Oh and not to mention that all your transactions are constantly monitored and they can and will freeze your funds or even close your account on a whim (accept money for a service we/our government doesnt agree with? merchant account closed, funds frozen)
With bitcoin, I can make any purchase I want and for however much money I want, without paying 2 - 3% + in fees (standard fee is worth only about 1 1/2 cents..), without having to pay ridiculous amounts of interest, without having to worry wether or not  my identity is going to be stolen, or my credit card number used by someone else (and then having to deal with idiots on the phone for hours to get everything reversed and a new card sent to you), and without having every transaction I make closely monitored by some big corporation. Plus, the transaction can be complete and over with in like 10 minutes.
From a merchants point of view.. you can accept bitcoins without any involvement, signup fees or any other bullshit from the financial industry. There is zero risk of having your payment reversed and screwing you over. Zero fees for accepting transactions, and no monthly or annual account fee. And probably most importantly, there is no way that the bank, government, CC company etc. can decide to freeze or take away your funds just because they dont like the service or product you are offering.

Oh ya man, so retarded. Iv literally talked to like 12 different people about it so that I can start using email transfers again and they all have been totally useless and just send me to someone else..
 * went to RBC, they said that since my account is closed it should be all good and I should be able to use transfers just fine at another bank..
 * talk to CIBC, they tell me nothing to do with them, have to go talk to RBC
 * talk to RBC again, they tell me to go talk to CIBC...
 * CIBC says they dont know anything, gives me a number for another department
 * other department says theyl call  me back about it within 5 business days...
 * They never call (of course). So I call back. this time they give me another number for some national fraud thing. Call them, they tell me nothing and send me to another number
 * Call the other number, they tell me when will get back to me within 2 business days
 * They never call again... call them back, this time they tell me that theres nothing they can do and that I have to talk to Certapay (the parent company that handles e-transfers/interac stuff)
 * Call Certapay, open a ticket with them and they say they will get back to me
 * Never hear back from them either. So I call Certapay again. Turns out no one actually opened a support ticket. So get another one opened and explain everything that is happened. Yet again, they say they will get back to me
 * Still never received a call back after like a couple weeks... so I call them to check on the status. They tell me that they talked to both banks, and that theres nothing they can do (apparantly once your flagged in their system its near impossible to be un-flagged), and that the only thing I can do is go talk to RBC.............
 * So I go call RBC again. They tell me sweet dick all and that basically my only hope is to talk with one of the main branch managers. Aparantly nobody is allowed to make appointments for managers, so the only way is to physically go down to the branch, ask for the certian manager and hopefully set up an appointment with them.
So now basically I have to go try and setup a meeting with a manager, try and explain to them that im the one that got scammed and I have actual proof, then hopefully it will be resolved. Huge pain in the ass to do since I work 9-5, bank is only open like 9-4, and I dont drive so I basically have to specifically get like at least half a day off work just to go down there and hopefully manager will be there. 
Oh ya, and when it first went down, one of the branch managers (who came to talk to me after me waiting well over an hour for them to figure out why my account was frozen in the first place) straight up refused to investigate the claim on the other guys end (as in, contacting the guy claiming fraud and getting his side of the story). Like wtf, can I seriously just accept a transfer from anyone, reverse it on them for any reason I want, have their account frozen and banned from e-transfers, and just run off with the money, without even questioning from the bank? wtf?
Just goes to show how fucking useless and retarded the existing banking system is and why we need things like Bitcoin.

Why go work at mcdonalds when you can make money just playing video games, doing random things online (lots of ways already to make btc doing data entry, surveys, affiliate programs), and of course getting tips on reddit.

Ah, I see. To be honest, I dont use the blockchain wallet at all, was just a comment on web wallets in general. Iv read so many stories of people losing alot of money

* Bitcoin is only hard to buy from exchanges because it is so rdiciulously easy to scam people with the tradditional money system, where with bitcoin it is impossible (with regards to reversing transactions). Try signing up for a credit card, or any sort of investment. You are likely to have to go through the same verification BS
*  - by far the easiest way to buy bitcoins. Meet someone with cash or make a deposit to somebodies bank accounts. Bitcoins are held in escrow so the risk is reduced alot. Sometimes you may need to verify your ID still (if you are using a reversible payment method.. like email transfers etc.), but that usually just entails sending a quick pic of your photo ID and maybe a utility bill, and waiting for the trader to confirm, usually within the hour. Much better than waiting days or weeks for an exchange to verify you, and requiring much  more details identification.
* Volatility isnt really that big of a deal when making purchases. At this point, most things are priced in USD, and then you pay whatever the equivilant in BTC is **at the time of purchase**. If BTC is $100/1 BTC, and I want to buy something that is priced at $100... generally you would just send the 1 BTC. If it jumped up to $110/1 BTC before the purchase is done, its not going to be like "you owe us another 0.1 BTC!!". The exception to this is if the website is using the Mt. Gox Merchant payment platform, which actually does change the price on you in real time even after you sent it (which is fucking retarded)
* Dont use web wallets. Use electrum ( Write down the seed it gives you when you first start it up, and keep that somewhere safe (like a safety deposit box or something). As long as your computer isnt infected with a bunch of malware specifically looking for unencrypted bitcoin wallets to steal, your not going to lose your coins (the seed you wrote down can recover your entire wallet from anywhere).

if 100 new addresses were made and used every second, it would still take longer than the age of the entire universe (billions of years) to use every possible address

tl;dr, basically he goes off on a bunch of bullshit claiming how smart he is and how he predicted or somehow had something to do with alot of the major events in the bitcoin world over the past while. And then childishly insulting every person that disagrees or even just asks him a question.

BTC Jam is a decent concept, but the site kind of sucks, and is basically overrun by scammers.

have you used bitcoin? Transactions show up almost immediately (often within seconds... unless you are using the shitty bitcoin android app, which likes to take 10-20 minutes + just to broadcast transactions...). 
Sure, you cant spend them again until it gets confirmed in 10-20 minutes or so, but 9.9 times out of 10, if you see the transaction show up in your wallet, you know that money is yours.

for those wondering. Using Electrum rather than bitcoin QT means no waiting many hours for the blockchain to download, so you can just make your wallet and be done with it

Pretty sure military grade encryption is just regular strong crypto, which is already used in alot of programs, such as bitcoin. They are just trying to make themselves sound cooler

I don't really think you are considering the fact that the internet has completely changed the game, and that no monetary system has existed ever before with the unique properties and features of a cryptocurrency. What makes you think that it being deflationary in the long term would equate to most or a large amount of the crypto economy being totally non productive (ie, high unemployment as you say)?
Sure, people can store a bunch of money in BTC, possibly watch it grow (or crash) over time, then reap their rewards either in form of purchasing power or conversion to their national currency. The reality is, most people don't have the patience for that. People like to spend, and Bitcoin makes it ridiculously easy and efficient to spend online (maybe not for everyone or in all cases, but the number is growing )
Also, since new bitcoins are created roughly ever 10 minutes, until around the year 2140, a continued growth is necessary to keep prices rising.
Im not formally educated in economics, so take what I say with a grain of salt. Just throwing my thoughts in though

Iv never heard of anybody who specifically trusts that their savings are safe because its "insured" by the government
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:17:40
even so, with a little effort you can keep transactions completely anonymous and untraceable. Creating new addresses, using mixing services etc.

ya, him buying it would be pointless, its not like they would give him the only copy. And besides, Theymos has had complete access to all of that they are selling (the hashed passwords in the database) the entire time
@_date: 2013-09-24 02:29:08
I agree wholeheartedly. The whole people only use btc to buy drugs on silk road bit is getting really old.

Your setting yourself up for a huge mistake by trusting online wallets with that amount of money. What if they get hacked and you lose everything? Its happened several times before and is pretty much bound to happen again.
If I were you, I would download electrum and create a wallet using that (make sure you write down your seed), and then move the majority of your coins into it. Its about as fast to set up as a web wallet, and so much more secure.
If you need to use a web wallet because you want to access your coins from any computer, I would suggest only leaving a small amount of spending money in it for whatever
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:02:10
seriously? Why the hell did you sell during a huge price reduction? Did you actually think this was it, the end of BTC, only down hill from here?
