Not as simple as it sounds. Imagine, some shit happens, NYAG or something else, Tether is shutdown or the peg starts to collapse. USDT is now rapidly getting devalued, nobody wants to hold USDT, who will take your USDT to give you BTC? If everybody wants to do that, the order books will be filled with sell [USDT] to buy [BTC]. Get it?

You could have made an actual QR Code, which, when scanned would read "Upgrade man". That woulda been mind blowing!

The golden cross is just around the corner, We'll start the bull run by the end of 2021. According to my calculations, 1 BTC in 2021 = $176k.

I agree, scaling on-chain is sadly not plausible, off-chain txns is the way to scale!

But the transactions have come down to 990k from 1 Million

Yes, multiple transactions from different users with different destinations can end up looking like a single transaction from A to B.
