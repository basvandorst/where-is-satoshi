This is Mark Karpeles, I'm still alive.

But I'm keeping his cat, Tibane:   
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:53:52
Dude, there's at least a million bitcoins missing, you are not alone.
If you worked hard enough to be able to aquire 200 bitcoins, you've got something going.  
Keep in mind what you've learned while working so hard, and do that to rebuild. 
Be smarter, stronger, and you should be ok.
I'm in the same boat as you are, as well as 100's of thousands of people.   
P.S.  If you ever stumble into Mark Karpeles, don't break his legs, just bring his cat to me :)  I wanna cook that cat and eat it!   
Hey why you gonna knock me for wanting to taste some pussy... ?

If I resign from the MtGox fuckathon, can I get my coin back?
Admit it...  everyone is closing up shop, little by little, like strategic chess moves, there will be nowhere to withdraw bitcoins and the fiat you put in, will be lost forever...
oh yeah, the bitcoins too...  are safe, you just can't move then, touch them, see them, or fuck with them.
Good day!

His accounting was alllll fucked up.   
I'm currently reading all of his online postings everywhere and he mentioned I think in 2011 it would take a year to prepare his books for auditing.   
If you think the picture of his desk is sloppy....   
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:48:53
If I were Mark "Homer Simpson" Karpeles
I would be hiding in Fukushima, nobody would think of looking there...  could be a quick way to loose weight too and it would be so fitting since he's a fuckup like Homer Simpson, to be with the molten nuclear reactor core.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:26:33
He'll never let that out...  that would end the whole game of the bitcoin scam, and other cryptocurrency scams...

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tokyo, J
apan, February 20th, 201
Dear MtGox Customers,
Thank you for your patience this week while we are working on re-initiating bitcoin
withdrawals. In addition to the technical issue, this week we have experienced some
security problems, and as a result we had to relocate MtGox to our previous office building
in Shibuya (details can be found here
). The move,
combined with some other security and technical challenges, pushed back our progress.
As much as we didn’t want to only provide an “update on an update”, this is the current
status. We are committed to solving this issue and will provide more information as soon
to keep everyone in the loop.
We are very sorry for the delays and deeply appreciate your kind understanding and
continuous support.
Best regards,
MtGox Team

Question:   why does gox have polish click buttons when the site is in english?  
Question:  will they fix the polish buttons first or the withdrawls first?
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:43:25
me too,  I sent in like 5 support tickets for foriegn language buttons on the trading page.  It's in fucking POLISH!

If you had a billion dollars in bitcoin, would you loose the private key?  
If you did, why wouldn't you just say hey, we have the coins but we lost the keys &amp; MOVE ON.
It's unlikely he lost the private keys.

USD are still withdrawable from all banks &amp; insured.
BANKS that do this shit, pay out through FDIC.
USD are more stable, even though they are printing billions more every month.
The USD, Diamonds, Cryptocurrencies, they're all in the same category.

So if someone has bitcoins in MtGox, they should sell?
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:25:35
I would no doubt restore the site, return all coins to account holders, with interest distributed from all of my personal accounts, and open withdrawels.  
For about 1 second I'd be broke, pennyless, but as soon as a trade occurs, money will be pouring in again...   
As for withdrawels, it would only be fair and gain trust.
And finally, if I were Mark Karpels, I would give my Cat Tibane to MagicalFux, so he can eat that pussy!

Yeah, Thursday's update was completely useless for anyone involved in Gox. 
It's ONLY confirmation that anyone involved in Gox can be assured that the "ASSETS OF THE CUSTOMERS" are in safe hands.   yeah right....
This is a complete disappointment.

Mark stated the coins are not lost just yet..
only temporarily unavailable.
Uhm.  Political correctness is a mental disorder.
When someone takes your cat, it's coming to my place for dinner, and that pussy will be temporarily unavailable, Mark.
