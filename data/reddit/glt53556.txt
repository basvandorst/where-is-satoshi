I'm so unlucky! I was just working on it because I wanted to translate it in Italian. Unfortunately I did not manage to download it in time. Anyone can provide me with the pdf?
I'd really appreciate

I completely agree with you, and I also believe that cryptos will be firstly accepted in "fucked up" countries with hyper inflation, govt corruption etc. But, as you mentioned, a crisis in the US will be of a much bigger scope. I believe the next crisis will be huge and will eventually lead to the complete failure of the current system. We can't just keep filling the holes..  We need to replace and improve the whole system. I hope cryptos and blockchain will be ready for when that happens!

While I agree that a crash is coming soon (just take a look at the DJ, at ATH) I believe it wouldn't really be good for Bitcoin or cryptos in general. The system is not ready yet to completely replace the current monetary system! We need to wait a couple of years for all the projects to be completed and developed. Once an economy based on blockchain will be possible, hell yeah I'm looking forward to the next crisis. The impact on the price of Bitcoin is also not clear, most people will probably take refuge in common assets such as material metals, not so many will go into crypto as they're not that fungible yet.
