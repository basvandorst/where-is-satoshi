After browsing OpenBazaar I realised there are lots of "junk" listings. I decided it'd be nice to have a store selling Bitcoin merchandise that is paid for in bitcoin. Please have a look and let me know what you think. Will be adding more items slowly over time! Thoughts on pricing?
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:37:23
I'll have a look. Thanks 
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:22:13
Can you please specify the sort of assistance you need 
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:51:58
my anti-virus blocked the site so that's probably enough to tell you to keep away
If it's too good to be true it probably is, money isn't easy to make that's why most people aren't very wealthy
@_date: 2016-08-21 21:54:19
do they charge a high premium for these?
@_date: 2016-08-23 10:48:41
yeah my bad
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:20:33
@_date: 2016-08-18 20:40:42
thank you!
do you own a store on openbazaar as well?
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:48:41
Will it be filmed and placed online?
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:14:50
why so low?
@_date: 2016-08-18 19:38:53
Apologies if the responses of some of the other users are a bit aggressive. What you're doing is called arbitrage. It's nothing new and is done all over the business world, in fact someone has probably spotted this discrepancy and if capitalising on it like yourself.
My advice is to be cautious. The amount you're likely to make from this isn't really worth the risk you're taking if you're buying from a shady btc dealer. Go to localbitcoins.com and see if someone there with good rating that can help you.
Good luck!

"type to equate Skype malfunctions with government interference with new media broadcasts"
I stopped reading at this point. This guy probably bases his prediction on 2 minutes research. Not just on btc but everything
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:16:54
I can help with that. Where are you located? 
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:45:58
actually I take that back, second time I logged on I got it, but I got the openbazaar one first so I assumed it's the official one
duo looks much cleaner though, good work!
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:41:43
New to open bazaar. That search looks much better 
@_date: 2016-08-22 01:24:11
This guy is such a good speaker but not good enough to mask the amount of rubbish coming out of his mouth. What even is one coin 
@_date: 2016-08-25 06:59:03
Do you see the use of blockchain in any healthcare scenarios? 
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:18:02
I would be very disappointed if it was only 700-900 by end of 2017, seems a bit low
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:09:21
I'm from the uk and won't be able to make it at that time of year but would love to see the outcome of the conference
@_date: 2016-08-21 21:27:30
What is it? An exchange?
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:41:12
nope none 
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:07:22
By 2018 though?? Seems too soon 
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:38:40
I really doubt he/she would mind
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:28:13
Obviously it's legal
welcome to the community :)
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:21:27
Can you please expand on this?
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:03:25
Changes we will be looking to implement soon:
1) ID verification for all customers
2) Allowing buying codes with EUR and GBP
3) Lowering the price of the codes, currently high to supply demand. In fact once fully launched, by buying the codes you'd be saving money on currency conversion rates  and depositing fees
Looking for constructive criticism please. We want to make the btc community as much a part of this as possible.
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:10:20
saves me having to move my money overseas 
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:28:39
Thanks for your input
I believe Charlie Shrem was imprisoned for violating anti-money laundering regulations and not regulating bitinstant well enough.
This will be a completely regulated platform where all users require strong forms of ID, a photo of them holding their ID and a proof of address before they even buy a token from us.
@_date: 2016-06-27 01:12:02
and you're suspecting a drop in price?
@_date: 2016-06-26 00:36:49
I'm from the UK
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:47:56
Do you have a link that I can go to in order to look at this way of generating an investment?
Sorry about my lack of knowledge here, ethereum isn't something I've looked into very much
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:14:58
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-06-27 00:54:34
Excellent point.
But surely big miners won't allow price to drop to $300 because that would mean they go out of business.
25 block reward at $300 surely isn't feasible in the long run
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:33:47
can confirm that my company  has worked with Dan and he seems legit enough
People are very hostile on this forum and other btc forums. This is one of the main problems with our community. 
Good luck Dan and we look forward to working with you in the future! 
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:53:09
We've received a new batch of codes
It is now $550 for $500 worth of code, the price will decrease gradually over time - perhaps to as low as $510 for $500. We just need to fund raise a bit more capital and are currently having talks with btc-e themselves.
Apologies for the very inflated prices originally. We tend to increase prices when stocks are low in order to avoid someone ordering when supplies are low as we do not currently have an automated process of doing this.
@_date: 2016-06-24 16:17:07
Of course we would get a licence before transmitting any money and the banks we use would be aware of the business model
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:33:14
They will be reduced soon enough, just at the moment the demand is very high so due to a temporary low supply we need to increase the price.
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:11:15
I'm looking to buy the coins in pounds hence the 1% over market value 
@_date: 2017-01-17 02:44:58
bitcoin is a very high risk investment. You could be risking a lot of people's hard earned money. Do you make it clear how risky of an investment it is?
what commission do you charge per transaction you do? 
what is your background?
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:20:54
thanks for sharing!
how do you find your customers?
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:47:12
Have an upvote my friend
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:22:38
haha :p
@_date: 2017-01-14 23:24:59
no chance. Next batch of S9s will be around $2k mark and that's if you can get one before the batch sells out
that last batch was $1232 because of btc price and difficulty at that time. Batch price is dependent on these 2 factors
@_date: 2017-01-15 11:02:43
custom batch. It will do 13 Th/s
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:23:06
yeah but there are many factors that can cause it to go down
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:46:07
UK should be a LOT darker
the value of our currency has dropped massively since Brexit. Just 8 years ago 1£=2$ now it's barely $1.2
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:05:31
Any sources to verify their reputation? 
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:04:29
They aren't in stock hence why posting here 
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:31:19
@_date: 2016-12-22 08:27:36
Why are you selling?
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:05:40
Out of stock 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:46:32
neither do I but he has 23 million followers so I can't complain haha

he can move them
surely he may want to cash out at some point?

the fund will employ 4 strategies to grow investor funds. This includes investing in coins we deem to perform well. Other strategies include the purchase of mining hardware and ICO investments 
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:04:26
I’d buy this for sure

I bought some maidsafecoins from poloniex (about 500) and I transferred them into my btc wallet but the transactions are appearing a bit odd, see this as an example 
@_date: 2016-09-09 20:57:01
@_date: 2016-09-04 11:04:45
When will the artist have more in stock, I really want the gold one?!
@_date: 2016-09-10 08:31:28
go for it. You'd probably be making a loss but if you claim you can do it, do it! :)
@_date: 2016-09-11 19:07:36
if i buy safe coins can I store it in any btc wallet?
@_date: 2016-09-12 06:59:02
I fell in love with the idea as soon as I heard about it yesterday. I made a mistake though by transferring them to my trezor wallet and now I can't get them out of it. How much money do you have in trezor if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2016-09-08 16:50:00
mmm, weird one. Thing is his contract probably doesn't have anything saying he can't do this but strictly speaking it is unethical. I say confiscate as it is unauthorised equipment on company premises and if he comes asking fine him and if he refuses fire him. 
@_date: 2016-09-11 16:33:28
Very clever idea. Love it. What's the eta on release?

What the heck is g20? 
@_date: 2016-09-05 22:14:54
here's the problem
btc is far too unstable to be used by "poor" people. A currency is no good if it fluctuates by a few dollars each day. I don't think btc will ever be a currency. I can see it being used as a store of wealth alongside gold but not a currency.
@_date: 2016-07-25 23:40:03
Haha maybe in la la land 
@_date: 2016-07-26 01:02:27
Yes but I think January 2017 is a bit optimistic. Maybe 2018 
@_date: 2016-07-24 01:44:14
A blockchain can help prevent this with multi-signatures and cryptography. The data is hashed onto the blockchain and then, using multi-signatures, people can gain access only if there is approval from the appropriate number of people. Using this technology, there could be a rule that for patient records to be accessed, the doctor, nurse and patient must all approve; or, perhaps, 2-of-3 have to approve access.
@_date: 2016-07-26 01:25:50
Better buy now then! 
@_date: 2016-07-26 02:41:25
this will allow btc to be traded on exchanges right?
@_date: 2016-07-26 01:38:30
Ffs dude leave 1 Satoshi for me pls
@_date: 2016-07-25 21:05:31
yeah I agree. About 1000$ ish
2000$ by july 2017 I think
@_date: 2016-07-26 01:02:26
Yes but I think January 2017 is a bit optimistic. Maybe 2018
