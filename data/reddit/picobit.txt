I just installed it on my jailbroken phone (running 7.1.1).  Please do not make it detect jailbreaks and make it impossible to install.  But issue a big fat warning and require that the user types "I understand". :)
Most of us nerds understand the risk, and would still rather use a good, safe wallet on our jailbroken phone than bad, risky ones.  I still think using a good native wallet on a jailbroken phone is better than a web wallet on a non-jailbroken phone.  Of course, if I installed all kind of junk on my phone there would be significant risk, but with a few tweaks of good reputation I do not judge it to be significant.
And no, I will not blame you if hackers steal my bitcoins from my phone.  I would never put more than an insignificant amount on my phone anyway - jailbreak or no jailbreak.
@_date: 2014-03-20 11:27:37
Extremely unlikely.  Why would somebody hack their site and then send out such notifications.  It looks like a database glitch, probably something in relation to their restore from backup yesterday or the day before.  
@_date: 2014-06-29 19:34:57
Just about to try it.  It wants me to input a "wallet backup phrase" and warns me that whoever sees the phrase can spend the coins.
Is the seed derived from a user-supplied input, like in a brain wallet?  That would be a total disaster, most users are going to input a real (low-entropy) sentence.  Any attacker can then offline brute-force such sentences the same way bad brain wallets are being swept.

But the problem here is not zero-conf tx in general.  It is using the change from a transaction you generated yourself before it is confirmed.  Most clients assume that is safe - after all you don't do double-spend attacks against yourself.  It turns out not to be the case.

With the price on MtGox being a quarter of the price on Bitstamp, does that mean the market truly believes the odds of withdrawals resume is only 25% ?
No, it must be even worse.  The market must be believing that the odds of getting BTC out of MtGox is less that 25% of the odds of getting dollars out.  Which we know is not looking too good.
I think MtGox looks bad, but not this bad.  This it the market reacting hysterically.

We need a way to verify the iOS app.  If the publisher of an app publishes the SHA256 of the app on their web page (GPG signed, of course) then we can in principle check that signature on the copy iTunes keep on our computer.  Thus we "only" have to trust the developer.
The next step, independently checking that building the source gives the same app, is far more difficult, since there will probably be metadata that differs giving a different SHA256.
@_date: 2014-06-30 08:44:37
Thanks.  I misunderstood what the app wrote.  My bad.  It clearly does the right thing - and it clearly states what it does.

Follow-up in case somebody find this thread:
TL;DR:  DO AS SAYS, NOT AS I DO !!! :)
I looked a little into what it takes to stead the keys in a jailbroken phone.  Any jailbreak app/tweak can trivially get the data.  I guess I could add such functionality to one of the "standard" apps with maybe 10-20 lines of code.  
I have now moved most of my funds out of my blockchain.info wallet (not that I had much there to begin with) - a bit into breadwallet, more into a desktop wallet (Armory), a bit is left in blockchain.info.  It is equally easy to steal the blockchain.info login credentials and the breadwallet seed.
Removing the blochchain.info app does not secure your Web wallet, as the login credentials remain in the keychain.  The same is the case for breadwallet.
So why do I still keep a bit on the phone? For the same reason as I keep cash in my wallet.  It may get stolen, but it is convenient.  :)
If I start using bitcoin seriously from my phone I will unjailbreak it, and start a new wallet with a new seed.
@_date: 2014-06-30 08:57:12
Warning taken.  I keep 99% of my bitcoins in an offline Armory wallet where it stays put (except for the occasional purchase).  I have had small amounts of bitcoins on my jailbroken phone in the blockchain.info wallet for years.  In principle it can be stolen from either that wallet or your wallet, I agree.  I also have cash in my wallet, around the same amount.  I regard bitcoins on a phone as only marginally more secure than cash.
If I ever needed to put serious amounts of money on my phone I would of course remove the jailbreak.  When bitcoins replace credit cards....

A power of 9 return.  Do you mean (2$)^9 ?  That is not 512$, that is 512 of "dollar to the power 9" which of course makes little sense.
You need to look at ratios not powers to see what you would earn if you invest a given amount of dollars.  
From $2 to $512 is a factor 256.  A factor 256 up from 512$ is 131000, which is still a pretty unreasonable price.  So you conclusion is correct despite the slightly too fancy math :)
@_date: 2014-12-18 11:42:18
Is it the same wordlist as breadwallet?  I.e. can I restore the backup from one wallet in another?   That is useful in case one of the wallets stops being maintained (not ver likely, but could happen)

128 bits of entropy:  
2^128 = 3.4 * 10^38.  
If you can try a billion passwords per second, that is 3.4 * 10^29 seconds or 1 * 10^22 years.  The age of the universe is around 2 * 10^10 yeas, so it takes more than 500 billion times the age of the universe to crack the wallet.
TL;DR: 128 bits is enough.

@_date: 2014-02-12 10:23:12
It is likely that they have a workaround instead of a solution.  If you are aware of the problem you just have to avoid using tx-id's to verify transactions (use bitcoin addresses or inputs instead), and avoid spending change from your outgoing transactions before the outgoing transaction has confirmed.  Neither are hard to do.
EDIT: Thanks for the gold.  Wow!

If they don't do something specific to retransmit them, they will never confirm.  They are ignored by the network when they are initially transmitted.  By the time they have become valid, they have already been discarded by the bitcoin network.  Of course a retransmit will fix this, but that would require noticing the problem - apparently not one of MtGox'es strengths :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:21:03
If you are paid a salary in bitcoin in DK, it will certainly be taxable.  It is just that they decided that bitcoin are not money, so if you bought bitcoin and sold later it is not a capitals gain. it is more like if you have a old painting and sell that with profit.  That is one of the very few things that are not taxable in Denmark.  On the other hand, if you lose money on your bitcoin investment you cannot deduct the loss.
Probably income from daytrading would be taxable (deductible if you lose) - but I am just guessing here.

This is very cool indeed, but has of course no relevance for bitcoin.  Quantum cryptography cannot be stored in a blockchain, and is completely different from quantum computing, which could be a threat to non-quantum cryptography including bitcoin.

The ASICs will have no effect.  When ASICs come online, the difficulty will adjust accordingly.  At most, the block rate goes significantly up until 14 days worth of blocks have been created in a shorter time, and then the difficulty jumps.  Bitcoin production may be somewhat increased, but not significantly.
As for the block reward halving - who knows.  Perhaps the market has already adjusted, it is not going to be a big surprise.  And how important is it anyway?  What fraction of the coins being sold on exchanges are freshly mined?  I have no clue, but if it is small then halving this supply will not be important.
Time will show....

Many have posted about this kind of problems before.  While it is of course OK for MtGox to demand AML verification for people behaving suspiciously for any definition of suspicious that they choose (as long as they say so), it is CERTAINLY NOT OK to wait until the user deposits funds.  If they can block withdrawals, they could certainly also block displaying the deposit address - if they wanted to.
And for submitting AML documents if you live in a country where that kind of stuff is illegal - that would just be stupid, probably better to loose the 40 BTC.  I do not think that MtGox will publish such documents, but they could be hacked, or a disgruntled employee could publish them all on pastebin, setting everyone up for an identity theft nightmare or worse!

Even that first code is not sent to google.  You either type it into the app, or scan a QR code.  The app is then able to make a 6-digit code based on the initial code and the current time, and the server can verify it.  Neither communicate with Google.

You can't send to a "bad address".  Even if your client did allow it, it would not be recorded in the blockchain, and your money would still be in your wallet next day.  There is a chance of one in a billion for accidentally creating a valid "bad" address where noone has the key.  But that is no different from sending to an address where the key has been lost, and cannot be detected by examining the blockchain.

Blockchain.info is a great service, but the customer support is ... erm ... not impressive.  Of course with what we pay for the service (I pay approximately 0.000), it is not surprising that they cannot afford to hire more people to handle the hundreds of email every day that they probably receive.
That being said in their defence: It may not be smart to store any significant amount of bitcoins with a service where you know for sure that in case of problems, it may be difficult to reach any kind of customer support (sometimes they are quick to answer posts on bitcointalk - but sometimes not).

The wallet functionality is disabled, as otherwise it would be kicked out of the app store.  However, if you use the iphone from the same IP address that you have recently used to access your blockchain.info wallet (this will happen automatically if you use a normal WiFi router), then it unlocks the wallet functionality.  :-)
For the newest version, you will have to jailbreak and install from the Cydia store.  Reportedly there is also a MtGox app in Cydia store, but I haven't tried it.
A jailbreak for iOS 6.1 was released Monday, there are still a few rough edges but they are being fixed as we write...  Note that although Apple says jailbreaking void the warranty, it is completely reversible.  After an iTunes restore of the operating system the jailbreak will be gone.
The new jailbreak is really easy to apply, no "DFU mode" tricks or complicated stuff:

No. Previously crashes have been so sudden that everybodys stop losses are triggered simultaneously. By the time your stop loss is triggered your sell order will be in the back of a long queue, and the price may drop even further before your order executes. To add insult to injury, by the time you discover that you have sold far below the expected stop-loss price, the price may have recovered. 
Stop loss orders will protect you against a sliding drop, not against a crash. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 09:15:37
Then it is empty.  The Bitcoins are not stored in the wallet, they are stored in the blockchain, which maintains a list of all past transactions so you can work out how much money is associated with each bitcoin address.  All your wallet contains is the private keys allowing you to prove that you are authorized to spend any money that the blockchain associates with your bitcoin address.
PS.  Don't downvote "stupid" questions.  They are only stupid if you already know the answer!

Maybe you can read the backup back in, but it is unlikely to work. GA stores keys in a secure memory in the iPhone, so they are not present in the backup. A full restore on the same phone recovers (or perhaps preserves) the keys, I know from when I wiped and restored my jailbroken iPhone. Perhaps you can right-click on your phone in iTunes and choose restore without loosing the jailbreak. Perhaps GA has already wiped the keys :-(

Note also that when you deposit, you have to send the exact amount with all decimals in place.  According to the TOS "Incoming Bitcoin that doesn't exactly match a quoted sum will be simply kept, reported as profits and distributed to MPEx shareholders.".  This was added after MP freaked out because his self-appointed court (Google MPEX ROTA") told him that he should return (or credit) 130 BTC someone sent him without getting all the digits right.

sha1 is not broken, as far as I know.
MD5 is broken for use as a cryptographic *signature*, since it has been shown that you can modify a document and keep the MD5.  But that most likely does not affect its usefulness as a hash function for passwords.
MD5 is still a bad choice for password hashing because it is so fast - just as sha256 is a bad choice for hashing brain wallets (for the same reason).

This is why the Armory developer is very reluctant to open up for encrypted paper backups.  You are far, far more likely to lose coins to a lost password than to a paper backup being abused.

The German state seized all the money, so getting it back this year is actually faster than one could fear.

No, it is ordinary futures, it is just futures for the USD price settled in BTC, but with the price listed in BTC/USD. Feel free to convert it to USD/BTC and get a std futures.

Ok, so I was partly joking, partly exagerating. But only partly. I seriously doubt that this value makes sense with more than one significant digit!  Would bitcoin be worse or better if the value was 50 rather than 54.3 uBTC?  I doubt it.
(Sorry, no mu on my phone keyboard, using u)

Maybe.  Then it is in the keychain, which is not normally backed up.  Maybe it is backed up on encrypted backups, that would actually be nice to know.  I am currently trying to restore my jailbroken iPhone 4 from backup without restoring the firmware.  I will report back here if it recovers the GA keys (and if the jailbreak survives).
EDIT:  It worked, all keys are back!
1) Delete your GA app.
2) Start iTunes, make sure you do NOT automatically sync your iPhone when connecting.
3) Connect your phone.
4) On the left-hand panel (may need to be enabled) right-click on the phone, choose restore from backup.  iTunes will tell you that it restores the phone WITHOUT restoring the firmware (really important if jailbroken!)
5) Allow the restore to complete, at the end iTunes resync's Google Authenticator.  Keys are back!
6 (if jailbroken): Consider installing the tweak that prevents specific apps from updating - its name eludes me at the moment.

Why does ASICMINER mine in pools?  With their size, would it not be more cost-effective to cut the middleman and mine solo.  (sorry if this is naive, I have never mined and probably never will).

If you feel you need to be armed to do something, you probably should not do it.  The other guy may think the same way!

I doubt a European bank would want to service an American company due to the onerous requirements of the American FACTA law.

bitfinex has a feedthrough to bitstamp, so normally there is good liquidity, but sometimes they run out of USD on bitstamp, and then you can only buy on their own exchange.  That typically leads to an elevated price.
icbit.se has real futures, just be aware of a few thing.  It is really futures in USD settled in BTC, so if you look at them as a BTC derivative they are nonlinear.  But not too hard to work out. The liquidity is often low, the fees are a bit high, and clearing twice every day is based on the price of the last trade, making it subject to occational price manipulation (although if you are not margin called that changes nothing in the long run).  Finally, unlike "real" futures markets you cannot loose more than you have deposited.  The downside of that is that your counterparts cannot loose more than *they* have deposited, and if they go bankrupt it is theoretically possible that your profit is limited.  It is very rare, but has happened.

icbit.se has been offering such a service for ages in the form of futures.  1broker.com offers Contracts for Difference.  Bitfinex also offers margin trading.  But one more is probable also welcome, at least if they are legit :-)
Does anyone have any experience with this service?

They cheated. Their app cannot send bitcoins - until you use it from the same IP (your home network) as you have used to access blockchain.info. Then it starts working from any IP. :)

Anybody can submit a tag to an address.  I don't think you have to be the owner of the address.
