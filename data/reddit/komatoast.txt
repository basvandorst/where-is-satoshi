If you are looking for some good starting points for trading you could start here:
[VirWox]( (For this one you'll have to buy SLL and exchange them into BTC)
My blog also hosts some information on making bitcoins if you fancy a peek: [BTC Blog](
For some mock trading you could just do what I do any pretend that you are actually trading, write down what you bought, when, for how much, etc. and then keep records of how everything goes. Example, if you (pretend) purchased X BTC at Y USD thats (X . Y) USD, write these down. Then you pretend that you actually made that trade and you now own X BTC, spent Y USD, paid Z fees for transactions, etc. Now play the market like real, pretend to sell, pretend to buy more, all while recording everything. After a couple months see if you actually made money or not, and if you did, you probably will make money if you actually invested for real. Because the only difference between pretend and actual trading is real money, pretend profits = real profits.
Hope this helped.
