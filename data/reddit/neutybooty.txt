Correct. The economy is already well on it's way to the point where we'll need to be kept in perpetual monetary slavery just to keep fueling it. The economy is already bloated past bursting, but we still need more of your money! Spend! Spend your money on useless shit you never needed in the first place!
With negative interest rates you are essentially punishing people for trying to save money and build a better future for themselves. That is where I draw the damn line. They already tax my wages, deduct social security, and legally force me to have insurance coverage, but I'll be damned if they tell me I can't save my own hard-earned cash.
If I ever see negative interest rates hit the US, they will never see a dime from me.

RobinHood isn't really even an exchange. You don't own the keys and cannot withdraw crypto from your account. You can only buy and sell back to the exchange in order to make money trading. So I doubt they really care about curating the coins available to users. They know that people are there solely to make money trading and not there to buy, own, and use their coins.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:48:31
I feel like this is largely speculation reinforced by confirmation bias. On social media platforms such as Twitter, only the "winners" are ever going to share their success stories. I have no doubt *some* shorters made good money during the crypto winter or even during the downturns this year, but claiming that it is "not that hard to make money with shorts" seems like an amateurish statement. 
Unless you yourself have made large profits shorting the market, how would you even know? You would need to have direct experience doing so to be able to confidently say that it is "not hard to make money with shorts", or at least be able to provide direct evidence of a large number of investors making money easily by shorting.
Rather, I find it more likely that you believe it is easy to make money shorting because that is your *impression* based on a limited number of anecdotes heard from strangers on the internet. Do not presume to preach "FACTS" based on something you are not actually 100% certain about.

People in the 15th century did not believe the Earth was flat. The fact that the Earth is round was known since ancient Greek times and can be proven using rudimentary tools. The popular myth that people thought the Earth was flat before Columbus sailed to the New World only came into being once Columbis day was established in the US.
Also, people did not believe that gravity wasn't real either. How the hell can you not realize gravity is real when it literally causes all matter on earth to stick to the ground and fall from heights? What Newton did was formalize it into a physical model and made it mathematically predictable using an equation.
The evolution thing though... yes, that took some convincing.

Suppose you even bought at the 13.8k peak, we're not even down that much right now. Do people not realize that a 3k swing these days is nothing? Christ, I watched over $100k of my own gains disappear in a month back in early 2018. Besides that, we're still up $7k on the year. 
Same old story it seems - everyone's mood is tied to the price movement. Back in 2018 I saw some of the worst pessimists crawl out of the woodwork. Toxic comments simply intended to attack OP no matter what the content, people putting each other down left and right, investors literally FUDing other investors that BTC was dying and that all the smart money had gotten out.
Then the bull market kicks back in - the euphoria is back. Lots of happy, supportive comments. Recycled memes getting upvoted left and right. 
People, if you're going to get into BTC or crypto, it would do you some good to develop some emotional discipline. The price going up doesn't mean you'll be retiring in six months. The price collapsing doesn't mean BTC is dying. It all evens out in the end. Just enjoy the highs while you can and endure the lows as best as possible.

Buy $100 worth. This will be enough to hedge against price volatility, as BTC would literally need to drop to $5k before you wouldn't have enough to cover costs.
Use the amount you need to buy, keep the remainder as an experiment and see where it goes.

Been seeing a lot of saltiness lately on the sub. Where's it all coming from? We're up $7k on the year and I am ecstatic. We've been blessed with great gains these past few weeks.

Yep, and I think that's half the reason crypto has attracted so many ambitious young people into the space. Every other market has been cornered and exploited to the last drop, but crypto is a new frontier. It's like industry during the 19th century or computers during the 1960's. New discoveries to be made and ways for even the most inexperienced newbie to get heavily involved. It's ambrosia for an ambitious student tired of restraints of our outdated college system.
But don't abandon what you started - finish college, maintain your career, and care for your families first.

Agreed. You are quite literally all in at this point. Never click that sell button, ever. BTC price plummets often but no matter what it always rebounds higher.

Not to sound salty, but do we really need these low-effort memes constantly reminding us to "buy the dip"? Also, I would not even begin to consider the current market anywhere near crash territory. We started the year at $3.4k and just went through one of the largest price surges I have ever seen us go through. When BTC loses 80% of its value over the course of a single year, THEN I would start calling it a crash.

Hodl: To hold on to crypto steadfastly despite steep rises and falls. A typo of "hold" emerging from t[his now quintessential forum post]( by an apparently inebriated Bitcoin trader.
Halvening: The fixed point in the BTC blockchain where the reward for mining a Bitcoin block gets cut in half, this time from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. Currently estimated to occur in May 2020. Halvening was implemented by Satoshi to create artificial scarcity for Bitcoin and to deflate the currency as time went on. Because the supply of newly created BTC will fall by half, there will be fewer new BTC to go around, inducing higher prices. Typically priced in around a year before it occurs. Predictably, prices soared this past May/June.
Bull: Someone who expects the price of an asset to go up. A market cycle where prices begin to soar is known as a "bull run", "bull season", or a "bull market". The extreme version of a bull is a "perma-bull", one who always expects prices to continue rising. Opposite of a bull is a "bear", someone who expects price of an asset to go down. An extended period of price downturns is a "bear market" or "bear season". 
Bubble: A steep rise in a price's asset followed by a swift and catastrophic downturn. Creates peaks in an asset's price charts. Bubbles are psychological phenomena fueled by speculation and FOMO (fear of missing out). In crypto, a bull season typically escalates into a bubble before finally "popping", ushering in an extended bear market followed by a cooldown and accumulation period. BTC has gone through 3 or 4 notable bubbles in its ten year history, always settling above its initial pre-bubble prices.
Ledger: A document containing transaction records of payments between accounts. Used to be done in actual books, now done digitally. In BTC, the blockchain is the ledger itself, containing all of the BTC transactions ever made. Because everyone can download a copy of the blockchain, all BTC transactions can be seen by everyone. Since the blockchain is not owned by a single entity, company, or individual, this makes the blockchain decentralized.

I got about 4-5 friends and family on board with crypto once they saw how much it was rallying. Now they text me every time it dips asking me if I'm selling or when I think it's going back up. I feel like playing therapist to these people has done the most to get me unhyped over crypto.
And for what its worth, my parents are the ones who actually never ask me about price. They have the most faith in it because they see me following it constantly. They trust that I'll let them know if they need to be concerned.

No one can tell when it will dip or how low it will go. Anyone who tells you otherwise is just blowing smoke up your ass.
Ultimately it is up to you to figure out when to buy in. Sometimes the price goes down a bit, sometimes it goes down a lot, other times it never goes down and we never see that price point ever again. Best advice is to just buy now and hold long term - dips do not even remotely matter on a long term scale.

Just buy it. As long as it's only your money, you are the only one at risk. Your parents dont want you to invest because they love you, they want to protect you from losses because that is every parent's instinct. But by making this move, you can show them that you are willing to take responsibility for your own risks. I think they will respect that. If they ever find out, just state calmly and assertively that this was your own choice and that you take responsibility for whatever comes next. 
$100, $200, or even $300 is absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things and is not worth agonizing over losing. On the other hand, you stand to earn a great deal if BTC goes up, but more importantly, you will learn tons about about blockchain and crypto investing. That without a doubt is worth risking the tiny amount you may stand to lose.

One interesting thing I noticed this graph indicating is that the price always starts the reverse slightly before each halvening. I imagine this is due to the principle that "if people expect the price to go up tomorrow, it will go up today" ie. people expect the price to go up after each halvening and so buy in sometime before then. 
However, this graph seems to imply that during the next halvening it will follow the parabolic curve underneath exactly. If we take this chart at face value, we would think that the price would rebound much sooner than the low point of the parabola.

Amazing read. Excellent profile of your typical "hacker" - hyperpolyglot, talented in a wide variety of fields, interest in obscure subjects, socially withdrawn, strongly rejects the typical 2.2 child lifestyle of mainstream America, experiments with drugs. 
Haas clearly lived by the "old-school hacker code of ethics", specifically with his rejection of mainstream values and his reluctance to use his vast talents for financial gain. Haas knew he was a social reject and was proud of it. He had that typical hacker smugness of being above the herd, of being plugged into some higher awareness than those around him.
What killed him was not the wilderness but the drugs. A lifetime of drug usage had clearly left his mental state fried. He had a history of mental breaks and running away from society. He was clearly in a paranoid state due to his overuse of phenibut. 
I'm an avid fan of true-crime disappearance stories. When someone inevitably disappears in the woods under mysterious circumstances, about 75% of the time it is due to drug psychosis. Under those circumstances, a severe injury like a femur fracture is basically a death sentence. 
The connection to crypto is fascinating as well. Who knows, maybe Tessr would have made its founders millionaires. It seemed like Haas was definitely on the verge of something big. But of course, we'll never know since the only copy of Haas's code was in that backpack that got swept into the river.
Awesome story, thanks for sharing.

Seems a stretch. First of all, governments wouldn't stockpile Bitcoin, they'd pull a China/Facebook and create their own centralized currency that they could manipulate and control with authoritarian ease. 
The USD, for example, thrives because the US goes to unspeakable lengths to maintain its currency's status as the petrodollar and the global reserve currency. Those who get in the way of that goal have their countries invaded or their economies crushed by sanctions. The US would never let the global reserve currency become a borderless asset that can be bought and sold by anyone, anytime, and anywhere. Especially when their enemies would have just as much access to it as they do.
Also, the idea that a handful of wealthy elites - Buffett included - has the power to suppress Bitcoin prices is conspiratorial non-sense. Yes, we do see a lot of ignorant and misleading FUD coming from some of these people (and mainstream media).
But I've yet to see anyone who takes their FUD seriously demonstrate even the most basic understanding of crypto. Anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of crypto sees how easily dismissable their claims are. To me, the idea of Buffett or anyone else of his status being able to manipulate crypto prices is laughable.

The best thing you can do for this guy is find him a new lawyer who specializes in financial crimes and has at least an amateur's grasp of crypto.

After you graduate, if your employer offers a 401k then you absolutely start putting money into it immediately. Especially if your employer offers to match your contributions (typically 3-5%). That is probably the only "free money" you are likely to be given in this world. By not contributing to your 401k you are essentially throwing that money away. 
On top of that, a 401k guarantees a safe source of retirement income should all of your other investments go belly up. All of the money you put in early compounds over a very long time. In exchange for a very small contribution from each paycheck (plus your employers free contribution) you wind up with a sizable payout in the end for doing basically nothing besides staying employed.
This might sound too much like the "conventional wisdom" you are trying to avoid, but mathematically speaking it is one of the smartest things you can do for yourself. Even the riskiest financial advisor out there would call you a fool for not contributing to your a 401k the second you get the chance. Compound interest should not be underestimated.
After that, make sure you sock enough money away to cover emergency expenses (typically advised as 6 months living expenses without any income). Also, I would advise you to pay off all of your high interest debt (school loans, car loans, credit cards, etc.) as quickly as possible, as the interest on your loan repayments will drag down your other investment profits and also drain the "spare" capital you have left for other investments. Also, being in debt is a drag and can royally fuck you if you're income disappears and you have no money to cover your bills.
After that, whatever spare capital you have left is yours to invest. 100% crypto is very risky in my opinion, but as long as you are willing to lose everything, then you know what to expect.

Just because the money will be harder to expropriate doesn't mean people are just going to stop paying their taxes. Long before money could be tracked digitally, people paid their taxes the old fashioned way: By tallying their income for year, doing the calculations manually, and then sending a check to the IRS. Receipts and pay stubs were paper - no digital trail for the IRS to sniff out in case you massaged the numbers a bit. It was largely an honor based system.
I suspect people will continue to self-report their taxes in the same way regardless of whether or not the government has the unilateral power to freeze their assets. The majority of citizens pay Uncle Sam his due and are happy to be done with it. Being honest and paying your share is a better bargain that the potential of a protracted audit, legal fees, or even jailtime.

Sorry to say this but this was due to your own negligence. No PIN on your phone is one thing, but to leave your Coinbase account on auto-login without 2FA is very unwise. Might as well leave your bank card on the ground with your PIN written on the back of it.
Report it to the police. Your only hope at this point is to actually catch the theif and hold them liable for the $7,000 in stolen property. Maybe there were cameras where you lost the phone. As for the coins, Coinbase isn't going to be able to reverse the transaction, so I doubt support is going to help you much.
The good news is that $7,000 is something you can bounce back from in the long run. You will make that money back. I know it hurts now, but consider it a costly lesson and move on with your life.

Be careful what you wish for. Bitcoin has never seen a large scale economic recession in its entire lifetime.

1. I don't have an accountant. I plug in all of my transactions for the year into bitcoin.tax. That does all of the tax calculations for me and spits out a nicely formatted spreadsheet with all of the numbers I need. I file my taxes through TurboTax online. They have a new section for cryptocurrency now. I simply take all of the data I got from bitcoin.tax and just plug it straight into TurboTax. That's all the work I need to do.
2. When you send your coins to your forex broker, are they still stored as BTC, or are they converted to cash first? Simply transferring BTC between wallets/accounts doesn't trigger a tax event.
3. Just ask yourself this: At what point in your process is your BTC converted to cash? Do you sell the BTC on the forex exchange, or do you pay the bills directly with BTC? The moment the BTC is sold or exchanged, that is the transaction you will need to pay taxes on. Simply holding BTC in an account or moving it around wallets does not cause a tax event.
4. If you are very confused over the whole process, it might be worthwhile for you to invest in an accountant. No shame is asking for help. Might save you a big headache down the road.

How did you make those capital gains on your forex account? Were you constantly buying and selling Bitcoin? If so, all of those trades need to be reported.
@_date: 2019-11-21 08:50:07
It is actually quite simple. Cryptocurrency is legally treated as an asset in the US, exactly the same as a stocks and bonds. It therefore falls under the exact same "capital gains" tax laws.
Any time you sell a coin for fiat (cash), goods/services, or another coin, you take your sell price and compare it to the price you originally paid for the coin. The difference between the two is your gain/loss, ie the amount of money you made or lost by buying the coin and selling it later.
In the US, gains are taxed based on how long you held the asset. Assets held for less than one year are short-term capital gains and are taxed at your regular income tax rate. Assets held for longer than one year are long-term capital gains and have their tax rate capped at 15% no matter what. And if you earn less than $40k total per year (that includes regular income + profits from selling coins, stocks, etc.), the long-term capital gains rate actually falls to 0%.
You do not owe any taxes on losses. However, all of your transactions should still be reported to the IRS even if it was a loss, as it is still a legal requirement. Additionally, you can deduct some money off the rest of your taxes if you lost more money than you gained that year, but the amount is capped at a certain point. I don't remember the exact number.
As for tools, I've used bitcoin.tax two years in a row now and it's made calculating taxes very simple. You just enter in all of your transactions for the year (including which coin, buy date and price, and sell date and price) and it will simply do the rest of the math for you. It will also keep track of which coins you still own at the end of the year so that you can import the date next year. 
Additionally, most of the major online tax services now include a guided cryptocurrency section anyway. The one I use even has an import tool to grab transaction data straight from certain exchanges so you don't have to type everything up manually.
In your case, using BTC to pay bills means you are selling your coins for good and services, so you will still need to report those transactions to the IRS. 
Keep in mind that you only owe taxes once the coin is sold (this is called "triggering a tax event"). You do not owe taxes on coins that you bought but never sold/traded, even if their value has gone up since you bought them (these are called "unrealized gains"). Only selling triggers a tax event. Also remember that trading one coin for another is also a tax event that will need to be reported, since you are technically selling one coin to buy another.
That's pretty much all there is to it. If you still have doubts though, bitcoin.tax is pretty much an easy solution. Let me know if you have questions.

If you are literally just giving away Bitcoin to your friend without receiving anything in return, you should probably report that since you are technically losing BTC in your posession. I believe that gets classified as a "gift" and can be written off on your taxes somehow. I'm actually not too sure on the specifics. I would definitely consult an actual accountant for a more detailed answer.
Don't do this if you are planning on sending your friend BTC and he will pay you "under the table" in cash. This means you are trying to conceal the sale (and therefore trying to hide from the tax liability). That is tax fraud and is a serious crime in the US. Don't try to outsmart the IRS. They know every trick in the book.

Come to think of it, I actually sold a big chunk of my index fund to buy BTC way back when it was around $1300. I saw it keep going up past $1k and was very convinced it was going to take off to at least $2k. 
Looking back it was an extremely risky move to pull, the exact type of thing r - personalfinance would have crucified me for (I was big into investing even before crypto). Ironically wound up being the greatest decision I've ever made. Got in early right before the massive bull run and have been hodling ever since.
Keep in mind that I got really lucky. Was in the right place at the right time. And the money sitting in my index fund was all spare capital anyway, so it wouldn't have ruined me had BTC tanked. Do not take out mortgages and loans to fund a crypto portfolio. Do not invest more than you are willing to lose.

I'm afraid complaining that the sub is not up to your standards really isn't going to change much. The truth is that as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, the content is going to become a bit diluted. Lots of inexperienced traders with irrational euphoria during rallies and sour, defeated attitudes during drops. More low effort memes and fewer quality content articles.
And yes, the mindset (especially on the front page) is going to trend towards a certain set of community-accepted beliefs. That's just the nature of subs. This is a social media platform dedicated to specific interests. What brings people together in these online spaces is not only our shared external interests but also the internal set of shared values, beliefs, and attitudes established by the community itself. So yes, a bit of groupthink is to be expected, but I personally don't find as egregious as you claim it to be.
Lastly, keep in mind that this isnt a curated news outlet like the Wall Street Journal. It's a free public forum where anyone can post anything from serious news and questions to fan art and memes. So its unfair to demand it always be serious analysis, opinions, and news all of the time. 
Hence, I still recommend you diversify the communities you visit if what you find here isn't to your taste. bitcointalk.org still has a massive online presence with a diverse range of users and topics. Another sub is And has a more detached view of BTC that you might like more. All worth checking out in my opinion.

I see where your head is at, but I think you're exaggerating the problem a bit. This sub has always been a bit of a circle-jerk ever since the 2017 bubble. Even before that when the blocksize debate was ongoing and everyone was busy picking a side and trash talking the other. And then just the constant memes and back-patting whenever price shoots up.
This is not unique to this sub and is just something that tends to happen when you have a group of people rallying around a shared hobby or interest. If that's not to your taste, poke you're head around elsewhere on the net and you're bound to find some fresher perspectives and opinions.

This is actually a fascinating article. Highlights just how useful crypto can be for these types of services which are frequently censored by credit and banking services.
* Crypto payments can't be shut down because porn violates its terms of services.
* They can get away with more hardcore stuff like blood and pee because crypto isn't there to tell them what they can do with their own bodies.
* Crypto doesnt take a 50% cut of profits just to use their services. All it takes is a small transaction fee. You alone are in charge of who gets what cut. 
* There are no chargebacks with crypto, so a customer with regrets cant call up their bank or credit company and refund the charges.
Really proud of how crypto can free all sorts of people from the tyranny of censorship and price gouging from financial services.

Which is a better investment - $10k put into an index fund that might double after a few decades, or used to buy Bitcoin that might double within a year or two?
In either case you still only end up with $20k, but with Bitcoin you outperformed the index fund by leaps and bounds. Even if you can only afford .01 BTC and don't expect the price to 100x ever again (which I don't think it will), the fact that BTC outperforms every other investment vehicle nearly every year still makes it the smartest way to invest your money long-term.
*Long-term* is the key word there. Bitcoin is no longer a get rich quick scheme but an investment strategy. Regardless of where the price *eventually* goes or how quickly it gets there, what is more important is that your own money continues to grow and compound year after year. Even if you don't wind up a millionaire, you still made more money than you would have in an alternative investment.
I'm not saying go out and dump all of your stocks in favor of crypto, but a well balanced portfolio with at least 5% BTC is going to outpace the market almost every time.

Most economic experts just recycle the same opinions that they hear from other "experts". Tune into a daytime stock trading show and you will essentially get the same market analysis repeated over and over from a parade of whichever talking heads are available that day. I imagine even the so-called economic journalists employed at prestigious financial newspapers are merely venturing their best guesses at things. 
The US economy (let alone the world economy) is a vastly complex machine with so many moving parts each playing off one another. That is not even taking into account the random psychology of human beings. The truth is, market movements are probably driven by pure chaos and are a complete mystery to most random armchair economists.
But these people are paid to know things, so they have to come up with something that sounds reasonable, even if it's just a pleasant guess. So long as the economy doesn't collapse overnight, everyone can move on the latest prediction the next day and the cycle can just repeat itself.

Technically yes. It's a global payment system and has been that way since day one. People use it all the time for that exact purpose.

But when prices plummet, the FUD on here becomes rampant, and everyone treats each other like dog crap.

I'm not sure I get the joke. Are you implying that even real estate and industry can be seized by the state?
In which case, understood. Money and assets are only worth what people think they are worth, so no investment is 100% safe in the grand scheme of things. Kind of sucks, but the nature of "value" means anything can become worthless under the right conditions. 
Stock markets can tank across the board. Bonds are backed by the stability of their governments. Banks can seize your deposits or shut down withdrawals during a crisis. Even keeping your money hoarded in a vault carries the danger of becoming worthless through hyper-inflation (or stolen).
So... clearly my next move should be to invest in a bunker and stock it with enough supplies to last a lifetime. In the end, the only thing that has "true value" are the tangible goods we need to survive (food, water, clothing, shelter, medication). Everything else is just a way to trade and store value.

It is easy to fit charts into whatever pattern you desire by shifting scale, time frame, etc.
Take a look at the scale on the side and notice that its logarithmic. That means that even small movements at the top coincide with drastic changes. We would need to go all the way down below $1000 to justify completing the bubble cycle.
But replace it with a linear curve and the chart is already well into depression territory. Someone trying to convince you that the bleed out is over could just as easily try to pull this trick.
My point is - meme charts mean nothing, it is possible to fit almost any curve into a generic "bubble" shape using many types of chart manipulation. 
@_date: 2019-10-05 19:38:49
Wow, this was actually a very thought provoking article.
I have long been of the opinion that everything comes down to money. Bill Clinton had it right: "Its the economy, stupid!" 
When money is flowing and everyone has enough for themselves, everyone gets along. Everyone feels secure and content, so its easy for people to be nice to each other.
But now the dollar is broken and has been for a long time. More and more money needs to be injected into the economy to keep it afloat. And we're seeing most of the money go to the wealth elite.
On top of that, inflation is causing what little money people already have to be more worthless every passing year. The result is that people work harder and longer for less and less money. We're all anxious and tired. We don't feel secure anymore. 
We are now reaping the results of those failed policies through all of these social pathologies: lower birth rates, political polarization, racial tension, mass shootings, and skyrocketing suicide rates.
It's hard to believe, but money drives life itself. When the monetary system is broken, life breaks as well. Until we fix the monetary system, things are only going to keep getting worse.

To expand upon the other reply... as crypto was just starting its inevitable descent in January 2018, people were looking for hope that new money would be entering the market shortly. Two posited events were Chinese New Year and Wall Street bonuses, both of which occur early in the year.
The idea is that Chinese investors receiving money as gifts on CNY would dump it straight into crypto, since China hadn't regulated crypto into the grave just yet and Chinese interest in crypto was still soaring. 
Likewise for the Wall Street bonuses - bankers and other WS workers usually get their typically generous year end bonuses in January. The idea is that this money would also flow straight into crypto.
Neither event held any guarantee whatsoever of saving the market, but people wanted it to work, so they believed it anyway. As it turns out, January 2018 was just the warning shot of a face-melting bear market that lasted all year and only recovered recently. CNY and Wall Street bonuses turned out to be complete snake oil.
As such, both of these things have become bywords for hanging your hopes on some external event that will somehow magically save the market. It's also a bit of a reminder of how delusional we can all be riding the euphoric high of bull run.

Still just circumstantial evidence sadly, but a very intriguing read nonetheless.
What's interesting is that this theory fits well with what we already know about Satoshi (ie. likely Commonwealth birth but claimed to be from Japan). It also supports the theory that Satoshi was a group of people, in this case a cryptography startup with the weight of several brilliant experts behind it. It all seems very plausible.

Its be because internet in the early 90s was still very experimental and fresh. Only techies and adameics really had access to it and were the only ones who knew how to use it. When it started gaining widespread attention in the late nineties, many were skeptical that it would ever be accepted in mainstream society. Many derided it as inconvenient compared to offline resources and called it a fad. One very famous article by Peter Krugman made some predictions about its use that are wildly inaccurate now.
Today, the internet is the lifeblood of most industries. Almost all commerce can literally not exist without. Some people believe that it will be the same with crypto eventually. There are a lot of issues that still need to be worked out before mainstream adaption is ever reached, but progress is being made every day.

Correct. In the US, you report your cryptocurrency gains on your taxes as capital gains. Same as stocks.

I've started visiting and a lot more these days. People there aren't married to Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, so you actually get some more nuanced feedback on the two coins. On top of that, you get a lot of discussion about how BTC and BCH are affecting altcoin performances. Everyone has their biases, of course, but at least there you aren't immediately labeled a shill for suggesting something against the narrative.

That is true by the law of supply and demand. If supply goes up, the natural price point will fall in reaction to it.

Phenomenal advice, agreed with this 100%. The only thing I would add is to not invest more than you are willing to lose completely, or money that you will need in the near future (ie tuition payments, mortgage, etc.).
And whatever you do, never take out a loan to pay for BTC. You will get rekt.

Yes, I grok the Google trends data. I see your point, of course. Google trends data is a tenuous data point to go on though, and it forms a weaker hypothesis that retail investing is not a big part of the climb.
At any rate, who am I to say you're wrong. I have nothing but intuition to back my suspicions. Hopefully I am wrong and we dont pull back hard.

If Bitcoins supply were ever increased, even just once, then its value would tank overnight. Because once you've increased the supply even a single time, there is no guarantee that they won't ever stop. Increasing the supply would be the death of Bitcoin.

I have to agree, there's really not too much content here these days besides memes and price posts. Though I prefer this to this massively cultish vibe of rbtc, the jokes start to get recycled after a while.
These days I spend a lot of time on because they tend to do a little more discussing and a little less hyping. Also, most people there aren't married to a particular blockchain, so you tend to get a slightly more balanced view of the two coins. Of course, people will always have their biases.

...who said anything about running it for free? I'm trying to advise you about transaction fees, not complain about them.
If you really cannot stand the ACH wait times and don't mind the extra 2.5% fee, be my guest and proceed. However, 4% is a high fee even amongst other exchanges (in fact, Coinbase is notorious for high fees). Coinbase is still a great exchange. I use them all the time, and the convenience is often well worth it.
But again, 4% is going to add up. A 1k purchase is going to cost you $40 in fees. A 2.5k purchase will cost you $120. It's up to you to decide if the lower transfer time is worth the lost money.

Buying BTC as a company is not illegal at all. 
What he is suggesting is paying a volunteer (a third party) money (likely cash) so that they can exchange it for BTC for him and then send it back to him. In return the volunteer is paid a skim of the cash as a reward.
This is a textbook Money Mule operation. The volunteer is laundering this money for him, and yes, the volunteer does eventually get charged with a felony. Feel free to Google it, this is a common and well-documented scheme.

Some of us are hodlers and don't care about ACH transfer times. So long as we lock in the price, that's all that matters.
If your complaint is that you want to trade sooner, Coinbase is literally the last exchange to use. Exorbitant fees will eat up all of your profits. GDAX, Gemini, and Kraken are all popular choices for traders.
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:34:59
I don't understand why people would want that again. When BTC last shot up to 19k, it was at the peak of its hype cycle and quickly crashed below 10k. Asking for the same thing this time around is begging for another crash. I would much rather see BTC slowly gather momentum this time around so we can get to 19k and stay there.

According to the Coinbase website, credit card transaction fees are 4%, vs 1.5% for bank transfers. So nearly triple the fees for credit cards. 
4% sounds low but adds up quick when you hit the thousands. 4% is also one of the highest fees for any exchange out there, hence my advice for using another exchange for trading.

So wait... does this mean Facebook will literally be allowed to pay their employees nothing? It costs them nothing to mine the coin - in fact, they're outsourcing the mining and charging $10M for the privilege to do so. In the meantime, they can send the coins to employees in lieu of a real salary. Employees will have to sell their own coins on the open market in order to retrieve USD (presumably with ATM and transaction fees on top). Employees will not be paid by their company but by random strangers hopefully willing to buy their coins.
Facebook is essentially getting paid by outside companies to mine their coin while theoretically reducing their labor costs to zero.

Do not, I repeat DO NOT try to convert back to fiat every time it drops $1000. These types of drops happen at least once a month. It always recovers, you will regret selling, and you will always lose money in the process.

Don't use a credit card unless you have to. Compared to ACH bank transfers, credit and/or debit card purchases usually come with much steeper fees. The differences between these fees are not negligible - card fees are much, much higher.
More so, don't buy Bitcoin with money you do not have. Debt is slavery. Only buy on credit if bank transfers are totally out of the question and you plan to pay off your entire outstanding debt every month (so you do not.pay interest).

Apologies, I understand what FUD means. Sorry for the confusing phrasing.
What I was asking was to point out exactly where the FUD on this sub was. It seems like everyone these days is paranoid that there are BTC and BCH trolls everywhere trying to ruin our precious coins. If someone says something that you feel misrepresents BTC or BCH, call them out on it. Show them that their ideas have no merit - that is how an idea ecosystem grows. It's honestly reaching McCarthyism levels on this sub. We are jumping at boogeymen, constantly reminding others to stay vigilant against some enemy that is seemingly everywhere and yet nowhere at the same time.
If we're at the point where Bitcoin lives and dies based on the loyalty of its users, we have completely lost sight of our goals. Believe it or not, this very topic itself is a form of FUD - spreading the idea that if we don't remain faithful to one blockchain or another, then everything will be lost. 
At any rate, do not take this personally. I want to see Bitcoin to succeed, but I get so tired of bipartisanship that has suffocated this sub for so long.
(And for what it's worth, I don't even go on rbtc because of how bad the whining is there).

I have a strong feeling we are only hearing one side of this story. So many people like to claim that their bank account was shut down because they were rude to a teller, have fringe political views, etc.
In the meantime, they fail to mention all the shady stuff they were doing with said bank account, tripping anti-money laundering alerts left and right.
Project Veritas, the Proud Boys... these alt-right movements all thrive on a narrative of oppression both real and imagined. This article is pretty much straight from their playbook. In all likelihood their account was probably closed down for benign reasons that Chase bank is not allowed to legally disclose.

Actually there are plenty of outlets, including some farmers markets, where you can buy goods and services using Bitcoin. That is what adoption is all about, and why so many people on this sub care about it. It is a slow process measured in increments and not milestones. 
Bitcoin is a useful tool for the dark web, but expert analysis shows that dark web transactions are only a fraction of Bitcoin's trade volume these days. The vast majority of transactions now are for speculation and trading.

Something is very wrong if the exchange you are attempting to buy on only offers to sell you no less than 1 Butcoin. It is possible on almost all exchanges to buy fractions of a Bitcoin down to the 8th (IIRC) decimal place. Make sure the site you're visiting or wallet you downloaded is not a scam.
In fact, please update your post with the name of the site/wallet you are using, that info would be helpful.

Upvoting this. Used this last year and found it to be indispensable. Just upload all of your buys and sells and it will take care of the rest for you, including printable PDFs of all the necessary tax documents. It is rather detailed as you can also specify buy/sell dates, price + any fees paid, which exchange you bought/sold from, etc.
On top of that, it saves your crypto amounts and when you bought them to import the data for next year. Already have my calculations done this year thanks to this.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:32:42
Agreed. I do not envy the mods here, they have tough work. 
Also, we could go even further back to the SegWit drama during summer 2017... the sub was a bloodbath of shit slinging, FUD, and angry memes. This has probably been the quietest I've seen this place since I started lurking in May 2017.

I thought your explanation was well-thought out and insightful. In summary, the thing to blame is the same thing that has driven almost every economic and societal disaster in history - greed.
The greediness of the government in thinking anyone could own a house, the greediness of the home owners who thought they could own McMansions on poor credit, the greediness of the rating agencies who inflated the value of the toxic mortgages. And certainly not least the greediness of the banks who were able to capitalize on all this avarice and turn it into a money machine, constantly pumping the whole system until it was bloated and rotten.

1. Not sure what you're talking about. Seems like its been doing pretty well lately.
2. Stop spreading such a negative attitude like that. I'm surprised you're into crypto at all with such a sour outlook. Focus less on the price and more on advancements BTC has been making recently. There is a lot of good news to celebrate lately in the BTC space (besides the price finally rebounding).

That is pretty much my reaction to this as well. I really don't know what to tell you or why it's happening at all. You're correct that the average American doesn't really hear much news from Venezuela beyond the bad economy (I never heard the zoo animal story, actually), so most reactions will likely just be of confusion.
Either way, stay safe. Hope things turn out okay for you and your family.
EDIT: Also, to be fair, mainstream news in the US is kind of a joke these days. A lot of it just covers politics and Trump's latest antics in particular. You have to dig or look at premium news outlets (Wall Street Journal, specialist web sites) to really get anything newsworthy these days.

I'm an American and I dont find this offensive. I'm also not surprised that this isn't being reported in the US - it doesn't really affect US citizens, so it's unlikely to be on the news here (though I personally find it pretty fascinating).
Also, I dont really see how anybody, American or otherwise, can find something like this "offensive" in the sense of that word's actual meaning. I think the word you are looking for is "confusing", since we are not seeing the USD hyper-inflate here or anywhere else as far as I know.

I never understood the competitive attitude between altcoin holders, or between Bitcoin and altcoin holders. A rising tide lifts all boats. The  market almost always boosts every coin when sentiment is green.
To me, being defensive over your coin only indicates you believe you got scammed by a shitcoin and now feel the need to defend your choices. In which case... do your research next time. Don't throw your life savings at a shitcoin whose only advantage is the collective belief that it will moon.

Depends on your thoughts on Bitcoin, perhaps.
Mostly yes, if you consider approval by a US regulatory commission to be a step in the right direction. It legitimizes Bitcoin as a recognized asset class that can have options and derivatives collateralized by US dollars. Derivatives trading also has the benefit of stabilizing prices by giving investors control over risk and adding liquidity to the market.
Possibly no, if you feel this just reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is a commodity for speculation, when it should really be treated as a replacement for fiat currency.

Newbies guide to crypto:
1. Create account on Coinbase (very newbie friendly).
2. Get verified by Coinbase by uploading required documents.
3. Hook up bank account to username (or credit card but fees are outrageous).
4. Transfer funds to username.
5. Use funds to buy Bitcoin.
6. Buy recommended hardware wallet (DYOR but Trezor is typically highly recommended).
7. Transfer newly acquired Bitcoin to hardware wallet.
8. Once you are satisfied with your BTC holdings, diversify into other altcoins that show promise.
The entire account creation process + verification + fund transfer may take up to a week depending upon the exchange and fund transfer method. 
Once you are familiar with this basic process you can experiment with other exchanges, different types of wallets (hardware/software), buy/sell orders, various altcoins, etc.
It's actually not much more difficult tha  setting up an Amazon account tbh, just a few more steps required for KYC.
Edit: Also make sure you are buying Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash, which is a fork of Bitcoin. And avoid Bitcoin SV, which is a fork of Bitcoin Cash.

I used to write Bitcoin articles as a freelancer, and as much as I value my own skill as a thorough writer/researcher, I can also say that the barrier for entry is not very high. Editors can clean up the worst writing so long as the writers can generate enough content for clicks.
EDIT: Also used to do editing for a cheap click-baity life advice site. Let me tell you, the broken English and bad grammar I had to edit out sometimes forced me to rewrite entire articles. It was very obvious that some of the writers had barely a basic grasp of English.
And oh god, don't even get me started on how many writers just plagiarized their articles from other sites, sometimes word for word. There are honestly so many sites/blogs out there who just want to turn out cheap content as quickly as possible, and plenty more bad writers willing to churn it out. They were lucky I loved writing/editing so much that I was willing to look past all of it to do my job.

Same, a lot of people told me to sell and I didn't. I had 300k in my account at the ATH. If I had sold, I could have bought a lot more crypto with that at current prices. 
The thing is, I didnt sell because I dont need the money right now at all. I have a stable job with a great income. I'm not in debt. So my logic was to just keep it in and let it keep making more money. No sense in killing the goose that's laying the golden eggs. Of course in hindsight it would have been wiser to sell at the high and then reinvest low, but in reality I haven't lost any money and have never been down on my initial investment. So now it's just a waiting game doing some hardcore hodling before the next bull run.

It really depends upon your investment strategy.
Some people go for taking profits. For me, that's too much trying to time the market and carries a lot of risk as you mention. You only win if you take profits, the price goes down, and then you time the bottom to buy back in. It also carries the tax burden of having to pay taxew on your gains every time you sell. Too much work for me.
I'm more of a passive investor ie. the hardcore hodler. Buy in and then don't sell until you're ready to cash your retirement ticket. It means far less decision-making on my part and no taxable events, but a far longer investment timeline. Personally I prefer this method of long-term gains vs. short term gains.
@_date: 2019-05-08 23:40:51
You're right, no third party is needed if OP can do his calculations right. In fact, even a ballpark conservative estimate of 20% would work. I simply prefer the simplicity of a user-friendly calculator plus exact numbers, and hence recommended it.

Shit like this makes me terrified of marriage.
Also, do not take that deal! You are about to get royally fucked like crazy and you seem ecstatic about it. She is going to come back in a few years once her little sexcation is over and then demand the child back, plus child support from you. She should be the one paying YOU child support for rearing the child.
The child support will be demanded despite the fact that you literally gave her YOUR LIFE SAVINGS PLUS YOUR INCOME. You are essentially being a *volunteer slave* to subsidize your wife's Eat Pray Love fantasy and you will still be punished for it in the end.
I am not saying your child is not worth the price. It is. I am saying do NOT trust your wife to honor that agreement at all.
EDIT, because I couldn't get this out of my mind:
I think I get what you are trying to say here. You knew parenting was going to demand sacrifice. Now life has asked you to make the ultimate sacrifice: Every last cent you own plus servitude to your ex-wife for three years, or your child's love. You chose the noble path. 
"Look at what depths I am willing to go to for my child! How many parents could say they did the same for their child?"
And for your grand sacrifice you now you look forward to your reward of happy years raising your child alone with the dad cred of a saint.
Let me tell you, sacrifice in the name of blind love is *rarely* rewarded by society and often makes problems much worse. I'm willing to bet you thought blindly loving your wife would save your marriage as well. How did that work out in the end?
Your wife is playing you like a fiddle and you are *proud* of it. She will continue doing so for years to come because she knows how well it works. You will suffer immensely in this life if you keep up this mentality.
I beg you, do not go through with this deal. You should have been out for blood the second she made the proposal. Fight her tooth and nail for that child. Use that $144k Bitcoin money and hire the best custody attorney money can buy. If you lose the case, you were just going to throw it all to her anyway. 
Fight, brother! Show your child what you are made of - he will respect you for *that* far more than supplicating yourself to that greedy bitch you call an ex-wife.
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:53:13
Couldn't agree with you more. The dollar has also lost its value against land, housing, gold, the overall stock market, and priceless art. Cash is meant to inflate over time, and the idea of preserving value in investments is not new to Bitcoin.

I check my actual balance fairly rarely, since all I really need to know is whether BTC is up or down. I do, however, check prices daily.

Coinbase does have plenty of drawbacks. Their excessive fees have definitely got on my nerves, and I know a lot of people get upset by their long deposit times and flaky tech support.
I think calling them a scam site is delusional though. Quite frankly, it's probably one of the safest, most reliable exchanges out there at the moment, especially for newcomers. Anyone who thinks Coinbase is a sketchy exchange hasn't been burned or seen someone burned by a real scam exchange.

I too have over half of my liquid capital in Bitcoin. It is not an insignificant amount of money, either. I bought during the rise when it was at $1300, and pumped a lot of my savings in because I saw it going to the moon (looking back, this was still technically a good idea because it has yet to drop back down to that price range). Nonetheless, I still have a lot of capital riding on Bitcoin, so I understand the dilemma you are in.
Allow me to share the lessons I've learned so far, and why I stopped worrying and learned to love the hodl.
1. The first two times Bitcoin corrected, I thought "The Crash" had come. I panic sold both times. Both times I regained my senses and wound up having to buy in at a higher price. Both times the price recovered and everything turned out fine.
2. Whenever I did panic sell, I sold low and was forced to buy in high. Prices recovered almost immediately after I had sold. What I soon discovered was that I was terrible at making real predictions on price movements, and that I would have fared much better if I had not made any moves at all.
3. If I do not need the money immediately and am investing for long-term profit, there is no reason for me to babysit my money. Prices have shown me time and time again that no matter how low BTC dips, it always goes back up.
4. As the old saying goes, it's only a loss once you sell. No one can say how long it will be before BTC reaches its previous highs, but if you don't need that money immediately, then it shouldn't matter.
@_date: 2019-05-03 04:02:51

My rec would be to use an altcoin until the BTC mempool clears. Things are going crazy right now with the 9k spike and crash. Almost any other coin supported on Coinbase will have a faster transaction time.
Legit no shill here, but I recently tried Zcash for the first time to make an international purchase. I needed a coin I had never bought before to avoid triggering a major tax event on my other coins. Was pleasantly surprised to see the purchase and then transaction go through near instantaneously. I'm used to the long purchase and confirmation times of BTC, so it was refreshing to see it go through so quickly. Transaction fee was low too.
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:12:57
All well said, though I have personally always viewed the "fiat is a scam" meme as more of an attitude or worldview than actual financial advice. Most people really do not think much about how their monetary system works and largely trust it to just do its job. I think "fiat is a scam" sort of challenges you to flip the tables and rethink your definition of value and how to best hold onto it. It's a reminder that monetary systems can become corrupt, broken, and manipulated when handed over to the wrong people.
The other half of it is that it's just an inside joke from the crypto boards that gets taken way too seriously sometimes.


More often, even less than that.

1. This is a common scam and they don't have anything on you.
2. Let them send out whatever video they want. Even the Pope jerks off. If someone wants to watch me masturbate then more power to them.

You need to open an account at another bank immediately. That is disappointing that a bank would just stick its head in the sand and hope its customers never want to buy crypto despite themselves claiming that "crypto is becoming more mainstream".

Thanks for the chuckle, that was unexpected.

If you have to ask, you know the answer is no.

This is probably faulty data or a bad API connection rather than an actual reflection of real prices.

I was just beginning to think this was a troll post. Its is truly *unbelievable*.

Might as well just flip a coin at this point.

I just like the wording. Pit pat puffy wing wong wang. Just drunk nonsense.

This post always makes me smile. Just one of those classic posts that never gets old.

Don't tempt it, it could just as easily plummet instead of moon. Be grateful for price stability after the bull run we've already been blessed with.

Agreed. The simplest explanation is often the best one. All of these "someone is trying to destroy Bitcoin" or "whales coordinating the dump right now" are all so cringeworthy. I think people have a hard time accepting the idea that sometimes price goes down or that the price is in dire need of a correction. Or better yet, people need to validate their decision to buy BTC after it crashes, and so need something external to blame for the crash.

Very true, but then look what happened after. Crypto winter.

Same as last year: Report as capital gains. Taxes must be paid on sales to USD (ie. selling for money at an exchange) plus transfers made between coins. CryptoTaxTool is decent for calculating how much you owe.
