Which is less than 1/10th the average transaction fee over the past month, what's your point? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:42:00
I don't think it will. Common people are now talking about other coins like Ripple and Ethereum. I think people are starting to recognize bitcoin as the vinyl in a world of mp3's. I think it will be a slow decline from here.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:33:16
All your thoughts are correct. If a new coin launched tomorrow advertising 10 minute block times, $40 transaction fees, and 7 transactions per second, it would be worth roughly $0. Bitcoin's tech is outdated and at this point it only exists as a speculative asset that has name recognition. 
If you want a provably secure, store of value coin that also has smart contracts, check out Cardano.
If you want a coin that acts as a currency with instant, fee-less transactions and 7000+ Transactions per second, check out Raiblocks.
If you wanted to see the latest tech that is creating revolutionary new use cases, check out IOTA.

Seriously lol. Post is saying focus on the technology and ignore the drama, and this guy is trying to use it to create drama.

It is currently the only coin capable of that many transactions. Not only the volume, but also the speed. When I withdraw off an exchange, it is in my wallet within 3 seconds, quicker than my visa card getting approved after I swipe it in a store. 


Most new coins have a "Rich List" that shows who owns what percentage of coins: 
There are already over 200 RaiBlocks Millionaires out there!

I thought most shitcoins were decentralized. I know ripple and iota aren't, but others like litecoin and Raiblocks are.

Less people are using Bitcoin and making new transactions, giving miners a chance to clear out pending transactions that have been stuck for days.

Could someone please make a well laid out rebuttal of this blog post and post it on another platform so that we have quick reference for whenever this is brought up? I'd hate to see this misinformation spread....

Well, 18 U.S.C. § 333 states:


I do not have the intent to render the bills unfit to be reissued. My intent is for them to be reissued as many times as possible for maximum exposure. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:23:43
After hours of research, I was able to find a positive correlation between the average transaction fee and the number of posts complaining about high transaction fees. It seems people do not like paying $50 for a transaction, since they are used to paying less than $20 to transfer money at a bank or even less with money gram or western union. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 08:12:40
Thanks for the heads up. Would never actually put any of those on the stamp, but it did make me laugh. :p

I like the idea of different ideas and software competing and innovating, but I just wish everyone could work together on one until completion instead of making 10 concepts that are only 10% complete.
or both have a really solid start and just need more help. Both have the potential to be fully anonymous marketplaces. I would love to see either get finished.
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:33:26
There simply needs to be more competition in the Bitcoin ATM business. If there was one in every gas station, good luck being able to charge maybe $5 over the market price.

I try to run a full node using the Armory wallet, but it completely bogs down my laptop (hard drive). My laptop is pretty high-spec as well. Soon I will be switching to a SSD and I fear the high amount of reads/writes will damage the disk so I will not be running a node. (may be an unfounded concern, but I don't want to risk it)
I'm not sure about other people, but that's why I don't. I do run Armory now and then to keep it updated and sometimes run the node when I'm not using my laptop though.
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:30:11
Ummm... 
@_date: 2015-08-06 20:49:28
I may be wrong, but I don't think safe coins are created nor destroyed. They are being traded from people who host content on the network, to the people providing the bandwidth and storage space. Then the 'farmers' sell the coins to more people who want to buy hosting on the network. Hashing doesn't exist in the same sense as Bitcoin. If someone provides 90% of the networks 'power', the worst that could happen is they can charge more for their coins, but the higher price would just encourage more farmers to farm.

Just deposit the coins into your bank account and use the bank account to buy bitcoin from an exchange, presumably at a much more reasonable fee.

Interesting that Mondays consistently have the lowest volume, while Wednesdays have the highest.
Any common sense explanation I'm missing?

The reputation system within Evolution worked great. When the market went down, people began looking for the former sellers, and confirmed it was them using their PGP Key. 
You wouldn't trust me to hold $10 for you, because I don't have a reputation. This is what keeps a schmuck from starting a money-transmitting business. You don't need regulation to keep people out, you need smarter people who take responsibility for their own money.
@_date: 2015-04-04 07:23:34
My imagination is running wild with who you might be and where these coins are coming from...
@_date: 2015-04-25 08:41:26
Where's the straw man? He is simply proposing that reputation will keep every schmuck and their dog from being able to open a money-transmitting business, while being able to prove his identity and thus his reputation using cryptography so that no other person can represent him.

You just gave me something to do for my day off from work. Exactly what I was looking for!
@_date: 2015-03-20 00:26:39
Kinda. Beta 4.0 is expected shortly, although the Operations Lead for Open Bazaar, Sam (says that he has "given up on giving specific predictions."
Here is a post he made 3 weeks ago:

How much do developers cost now-a-days? Is this enough?
1 developer
I also fully support your decision to use that money to buy beer. You guys work too hard.
@_date: 2015-03-20 01:41:18
True it is a different type of issue, but it is still a barrier keeping people away. 
I remember it took my parents awhile before they felt safe enough putting their credit card info on the internet to make a purchase. Worrying about security will prevent adoption until the security is automatic and idiot-proof. Firewalls are automatically enabled on computers. Even web browsers will warn you and prevent you from accidentally visiting a malicious website.
@_date: 2015-03-16 04:03:58
He downloaded the Armory wallet awhile back, but never used it. Is this wallet still good in terms of security?
Or, are there any wallets that use 2FA before sending funds?
Also, is the Mycelium wallet proven itself in terms of security? Would the coins be safe on it under all circumstances, even if someone stole the phone or the phone got lost?
@_date: 2015-03-16 04:36:34
I am reading about that now on their wiki page. It says it is a service hosted by TrustedCoin. It says you will be charged a "small fee" for each transaction that you use the 2FA for. Any idea how much this fee is?
All of this back up, encryption, wallet seeds, seem so confusing. I fear screwing up at some step along the way and either losing my coins, or creating a less-than-secure wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-20 01:12:49
I disagree with the ease of use of Coinbase based on my own negative experience, but regardless of how difficult they are to buy, another big issue is security. Hell, even I worry about the security of my Bitcoins and I have been learning about Bitcoin since late 2010. I store some of my coins on Coinbase just to avoid 'putting all my eggs in one basket.' Would a common person know how to encrypt a wallet, or how to make a cold wallet, or why they even need to do those things? They shouldn't have to. It should all [somehow] happen in the background, safely.
@_date: 2015-03-16 05:10:04
I see Trezor mentioned everywhere, but not sure how it works. I just looked into it a little deeper.
Would it be safe to say it is basically a permanently offline computer wallet that can never be accessed through a network or hacked without having the physical device?

My problem is that I like to trade all of my BTC when I feel there is going to be a swing (which is usually a few times a week), and unfortunately I don't actually use BTC for purchases yet. So what I'm really looking for a very secure and easy way to quickly transfer to my exchange address to make some trades, then back to the secure wallet address while minimizing risk as much as possible.
