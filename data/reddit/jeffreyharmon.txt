well that was my best guess.

I just checked my scanner and it looks like they fixed the issue sometime last night or this morning. I can no longer duplicate the problem. Glad they fixed, SUPER upset that they are not willing to fess up to the bug.

I totally agree. I actually started with 10 BTC in my transaction. then thought "I'll just send one" then thought "don't be stupid, this always works" and sent 5. One expensive lesson. I should have sent $1 to start.

It seems like it would be having the same problem today wouldn't it? today it is scanning fine. like there was a bug fix. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:53:37
I thought about that too, but it is working fine today (after I got the email from blockchain.info). I can't recreate yet again today even though I was able to recreate 3 times last night.

mirroring was just my best guess at what was happening. let me see if I can figure out which coinbase code it was trying to scan when I lost the coin
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:17:04
great idea. I am asking
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:07:14
it never showed up in any of my wallets :( 
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:44:24
coinbase doesn't even offer you the address without copying it manually and pasting it into a different app. I get it now, but it seems a bit much to ask for the average person, which I am. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:58:08
wouldn't it still happen today? I haven't been able to recreate the problem again today. also the BTC is still in that wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:20:52
I actually scanned the code twice before I sent the 5 BTC yesterday. I was checking to see if it scanned the same. I was foolish not to check the code directly, but coinbase doesn't even give me access to my code until AFTER I click "copy". I had never had a QR scan fail in years and didn't expect it to be a problem 
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:55:13
I will run a virus scan. But if it was malware wouldn't it still happen today? I was able to recreate 3 times last night and not today. 
The address still has the 5 btc. it has never been used before.

hey maybe it is coinbase!? they still haven't responded to my support inquiry... gives me hope. thanks for this link
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:02:10
I submitted a help request to coinbase as well yesterday because at first i thought it must have been them. They haven't responded yet. I assumed it wasn't them after recreating the problem. 
I gotta admit, this is all WAY over my head. I have all the security I can set up on all my accounts, but it is shaking me pretty badly that I can't trust a QR code. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:48:01
on coinbase it takes a LOT longer than 5 seconds because they don't give you the address unless you copy it. but I agree... now :) 
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:13:27
no it isn't filled. that is the language they have in the field BEFORE you scan: "Paste or scan an address or select a destination" 
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:06:53
WORKED! I had given up on this, and then a friend told me about your response when I got into work today. took a bit but we figured out how to get it back thanks to you! Thank you!!! 
Can you private message me your BTC or ETH wallet so I can tip you? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:23:32
okay I have found 4 coinbase wallet numbers that coinbase generated on my account during the hour that I sent the money. I am trying to figure out which one is the one I tried to scan. I need to figure out how to generate them on my phone. It appears that I can't do it in the same method with the coinbase app so I don't know if I can recreate the problem if it was on coinbases side.

about 23 hours ago    Details
sorry I can't be more exact. coinbase only gives me "23 hrs ago". I didn't ever see the address (because coinbase has that copy paste thing going on on iPhone) so I am not sure which one it was. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:52:34
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:34:49
the address has never been used before and the money is still there.

They are both successful business people. They DON'T need anyone to pay for a vacation. This is about filming an amazing documentary NOT a cheap gimmick to get a vacation. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 23:09:38
that is because it isn't to fund their lives, it is to fund a documentary film crew.
