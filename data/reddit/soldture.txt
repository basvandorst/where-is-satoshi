16K is a strong resistance level. btc tried to surpass it 3 times, but failed. Currently Head and Shoulders is forming. I would not recommend to buy at the moment, because everything indicates that a decline is coming.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:20:32
Then how much is a transaction fee? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:31:32
yup, but no one knows when it happens.

You have made a riskless choice, so you should not have any regrets.
With a HOLD choice you are going to start gambling, you could lose a lot. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:37:38
why do you need Bitcoin? Answer this simple question.
If you are struggling that means you don't actually need it 
You will lose.
@_date: 2017-01-12 12:02:20
You have already lost some money. Why are you waiting for?  
Sell it quick and never buy it again. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:59:45


                                                                 
Oh, that's interesting

Do not limit yourself with only one coin and miss out on those money making loads to get even more coins ;)

I've sold a half of my portfolio that's why ;)

They sell to buy something else, for example, Gold gained +1.12% just today

Okay, if it will not happen — you are going to eat your dick, is that a deal?

if you didn't know, it's not a real Bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2019-08-07 08:04:26
such a store of value, isn't?
@_date: 2019-08-03 07:01:59
What does sell mean?
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:02:34
to be Satoshi you should have 5% of all bitcoins in a specific wallet

This symbol is not ugly, but rather a symbol with a deep meaning.
In other words, it has been already taken. We cannot use this to describe something different with it anymore, probably for one millennia or two..

The criminal news are destroying credibility of Bitcoin just by mention it in the title. One bad apple spoils the entire barrel. But in the other hand, this news shows that everything is public and you cannot hide anything, everything could be traced to one millimeter. Which means illegal actions should be minimal on blockchain. As the time is passing through, we would have a chance to see really good stuff which implements Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2019-08-15 05:32:32
What do you mean, we have a room to dump? right?

SS Bolts? really?
@_date: 2019-10-17 08:17:00
At least we have people who are actually using bitcoins instead of just useless hodling or speculating on exchanges. Yeah, the example is not very good, but I hope it will raise awareness in people that it can be used as a payment method for different kind of services, not just for criminal stuff.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:57:49
what is the reason to share with reddit users?

there is no any "historical resistance", it's on the free run!
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:22:19
increase in volume means an increase selling pressure. People would never sell their precious coins during a bull impulse, but when then decide to fix their profit this happens. No coins to buy = price rising, too much selling orders = lower price.
@_date: 2019-04-28 08:17:46
It's going to be a Golden Rain when price dips even more

The real adoption has come. 2020 is a year, when everyone will be rich.

Based on OP's post he wants to get out really quick. This is not how Bitcoin works XD

@_date: 2019-01-12 11:18:50
The education is also an investment, and bitcoin investment is majorly a gambling game.

Got it. It is like Cross-Line Reticle for starting a new bearish scenario. When the price moves into center of the blue star — boom! everything is red.

It's truly amazing :D
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:39:13
Because it's easier to buy Bitcoin than sell it (cash out).
@_date: 2019-09-08 08:45:22
buying Bitcoin does not make you an investor tho

Probably yes, but the date is still undefined. All fiat currencies will get close to 0. Recession after recession, printing more money and inflate everything. It could be trillion then.

That's how to not diversify your money into one area (BTC) even if you buy alts.

next pump in 5~10 years 
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:48:54
all crypto linked to BTC price. alts are not self-driven. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:12:18
I wish you good luck

this subreddit becomes really toxic

8k is huge money for me, the answer is no.
