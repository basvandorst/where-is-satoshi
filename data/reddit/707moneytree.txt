@_date: 2017-02-09 20:21:06
Try libertyx it's all over USA and most the time it's 24hr gas stations so you have access all the time.Plus there fees are much lower then any ATM provider.

Cash in person not much if you deal with ppl who have good rating but if you use wire or western or etc there could be an issue.
@_date: 2017-02-10 05:20:27
I've heard of ppl sending money and then getting no btc that's why I prefer to meet face to face I hand over money and get the btc on the spot I usually ask they wait till I get at least one confirmation.Also check out libertyx I use it all the time and they ask for no info if under 300 or enter some info and you get 1000 a day limit.You go and buy for cash at there locations and get a pin that you could enter at any time in there app to redeem your btc to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-12 01:44:59

You dl there app and then just enter your pin and the amount is sent straight to your wallet.There is a limit but you can raise your limit through entering some info nothing like ss or dl image just some basic info.There is a map in the app that helps you locate There stores if there is a question mark on store and you go there you can get a $5 trailblazers reward which is nice bonus.They also use 21.co for estimating fee so they get confirmed fast.

I understand the concept that's  why I convert into tether when I need to get out of bitcoin for whatever reason.The problem with trading into alts is that you could end up getting burned when it's time to get back into bitcoin.As far as returns I'm early adopter so I got allot of my coins in 300s so my profits are up no doubt and I've been trading for a number of years so I've made a healthy profit from these activities.

You can keep your coins in your wallet and if you want to convert to an alt because btc goes down use a service like shapeshift to do the conversion and back into alt wallet that you still hold.My suggestion don't do anything just hold your bitcoin till your done holding.I tried the above method but usually ended up with less bitcoin��

I like Bread I never get transactions stuck it always gets the fees correct and I believe it's the only wallet using os level encryption so your keys are safe.I also use old iPhones with Bread on them that I turn off and put away when done if it's not connected it's even safer.

@_date: 2017-03-06 06:06:05
Thanx for the explanation that makes sense.Im signaling segwit on my miners not to many miners but it's still my vote I'm not sure if slush pool will listen.
@_date: 2017-03-01 02:29:43
Btw if you build a multi gpu rig and based on the gpu model you would be making at least 5-10 bucks a day in btc converted profits so that really adds up and you would be only using 10-30 bucks a month in electricity so it's not that much.Check out whattomine.

What we need is more American pools things are too twisted with who owns what in China pools.Plus this would decentralize things a little more.Doesnt make sense for usa miners to support the China shit show.The only btc pool that I count as USA is 21.co but I don't know if they are public or private.I would have thought mcafee would have opened a pool by now with all the investment he has made in the industry.
