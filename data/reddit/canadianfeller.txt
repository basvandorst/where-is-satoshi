Hey sorry to see it not getting more eyes, looks like you put some effort into it. I'd say reasons why it possibly couldn't be attracting more ppl is because what does it offer tons of sites in bitcoin community don't. I just looked at it quickly but seems like a discussion place with not much more. Tons of those around unfortunately. Maybe come up.with a reason ppl should go there. Good luck tho friend!

Is this Cody Wilson guy really who we want associated with bitcoin? Good for whatever advancement this will provide but I feel like his stance is one that comes from what bitcoin represented, or better yet how the media represented it, not one of advancement for bitcoin integration and development. My 2 bits

Cool design!

Oh my god. That is the saddest thing ever. A fucking heroin/opiate addict wasting more of that money? That enraged me for a short moment.

Your blindness is arrogance not passion.

Bitcoin is a platform that allows you to send money to anyone in the world, regardless of value for little to no cost. On the surface this seems insignificant. Is it tho? Say you had a friend in Korea. How would you get them that $100 you owed them? You could send them money through western union however your friend has to go to a location and pick it up plus you have to pay a fee that is not a super small amount. When people first started to see how they could utilise the internet it was because of the removing of restrictions that had previously been there. You wanted to find the directions to a place? No longer need a map. Want to see what that song was that just played on the radio? Check the stations website. Want to send money to anyone in the world at the click of a mouse? ... You see where I'm going. You have to make your own opinion. There are also numerous other benefits you can read about but in my opinion (which is not the correct one sometimes lol) this is PRESENTLY the main benefit bitcoin offers to the person who currently does not see the need to be vested in it.

Good luck sir!

All this plus the fact they are so fucked they are trying to trick people into a quick buck (as the person thinks). Basically trying to take it to the point where people are so enticed to take advantage of the substantially lower prices. I see no different from how the operate to a shotty investment firm that manipulates their prices to the advantage of the firm.

This is far and away the biggest fallacy about bitcoin. Price goes up when demand goes up. Explain how demand is going to go up now that Microsoft accepts it? Nobody is going to buy bitcoin so they instantly turn around and give it to Microsoft. I'm pointing this out because this sort of thinking is not doing bitcoin an favors when you go around spreading this sort of drabble. No disrespect pal but this sort of talk removes creditability, it doesn't add it.

Haha. Ya I don't get how tipping is supposed to take over for ads. Where is the incentive? If I already read something for free I am highly unlikely to pay for it out of the goodness of my heart. Especially online when there is no face to face contact. These ppl lead you astray. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 04:41:04
At the most basic, the price is going to go up when the quantity of ppl wanting to own bitcoin outweigh the number of ppl who want to sell it. So, Microsoft accepting bitcoin doesn't directly impact the price because people who do not already own bitcoin are not going to go out, buy bitcoin, then buy Microsoft points. Look into reasons why a stock price goes up, its pretty closely related to what makes bitcoin price go up.

Im not sure if I am too late but I would love to get strted actually owning any amount of BTC. Ive known and followesd BTC for over a year but never owned any :( any help would be gratefully appreciated my good man!

Considerable amount of red tape to go through. Certainly not impossible but you are going to need a) more money than you probably have b) more time than you want to give and c) more effort your going to want to exert. Serious legal consideration needs to be taken, reddit is not the answer to your queetions , a lawyer is.
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:40:46
Ya is this a consensus that they are making up the fact that BTC is the problem and not their own incompetence? Because man oh man that sure is some lucky timing on their part if the protocol part is true. But conversation? "Man put the money in the trunk and lets go!!!" (Sorry MTGox ppl)

If thats what your plan is I'd recommend going long. Real long. Not sure what your financial situation is but if Bitcoin is worth anything in 16 years it sure will be worth a lot more then it is now. Buy 1 bitcoin and nothing more. If it works out, youll probably be able to pay for 4 college experiences.

Bitcoin didn't even enter the minds of large investors when thinking about Sony. Quite frankly no one outside of bitcoin fenatics love bitcoin. Price is falling because there is no demand to support it at even mid 300's. That's it. Unfortunately. There's just no reason outside of speculation for an average person to use it at the moment.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:36:21
I dont get why this is such a big deal, what am I missing? Just because you can buy with a CC? Thats it? and only like .05 BTC? HMMM

Lol there is no way that class exists. I even looked onto the university website because I know they would not have a class on econ of cryptocurrency. 5/8 of ppl have never heard of cryptos
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:33:57
Ok what the hell did I miss??? What is with all this talk of 102? Prices dropped to 102? Man. Thats even better then Christmas as a kid!
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:57:19
fair answer!

Haha. Oh. Zoooom rite over my head.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:22:18
I know this will be downvoted like crazy but if one of the huge benefits of bitcoin is its low transactions, why do I pay more to use a bitcoin ATM than a regular atm? Don't these things take like 5%? serious question
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:04:52
Now that's just silly.

@_date: 2014-01-28 00:25:01
I'd say start a word press site and then you can incorporate bitpay through that... im pretty sure... but what the hell do i know. im just some guy on the internet
