yes. i then checked back a while later and saw that basically all votes were inverted.
it was so pathetic i had to laugh :D
it wasn't just one or two replies he had, but a whole bunch of them, and he replied several times as well. and he went through the trouble to downvote every single one of them and up each of his comments :D

Then why didn't they call it "Support"?
Anyway, you are probably correct that this job is only for internal guidance, support and conferences but I'm not entirely convinced. it just sounds weird, i didn't quite get what the actual job was and microsoft didn't write anything informative about their evangelism group either.
But maybe someone more familiar with ms has an entirely different understanding of this and knows what is meant by "Evangelist" and therefore no exact job description is required.

[look at these forum posts]( quite interesting.

and i was saying that this has nothing whatsoever to do with political appeals oO
it's a purely economical decision whether or not someone wants to use a bank...
no idea how you managed to construct this awful strawman but i think we should stop.

whatever. I'll never forget how you posted some incredibly dumb fascist comment, got downvoted to -20 by the community, and then upvoted yourself to +20 and everyone who told you why you were wrong to -20 :D
well, at least it kept you busy for a while...

yes it was probably a bad example but it wasn't meant to target microsoft either, i just saw the link, didn't know about terminology and thought it looked suspicious.
but it makes sense that ORM is outsourced to companies that have less of a reputation to lose.
anyway, the point is that it exists and it sucks :P

MODS MODS MODS can we make [this thread]( a sticky please?
Educated people can take a lot of work off the mods' shoulders, and i think we/they have a problem of being severely understaffed in that regard.

btw reddherring is one of the guys who spread the malware yesterday.
if goxx has his doxx we might be able to imprisoxx him. implying there's a way to link his reddit to his gox account.
they didn't seem too bright, so maybe he paid for the VPS with unlaundered goxcoins :D
actually... we should ask that VPS company for a txid and see if it came from a gox address or can otherwise be correlated.

[there was great effort put into social engineering people into running it.](
if people hadn't arrived just in time, elux's negative score would have been downvoted into invisibility by their army of alt accounts.
[btw found one more who might be involved]( his name is /u/ [isdnpro](
