A cloud wallet in disguise for 200$! 
It is essentially another cloud wallet, that stores all data needed to spend the money on servers (and private biometric identifiers!). The hardware is just another mobile phone from 20 years ago reinvented: modem+small screen+keyboard+sensors.
Actually, GSM modems and phones are very easy to attack with cheap open-source techniques ("imsi cacher + openBTS" on google), and from there it is direct path to the crypto controller and stealing our money. The attacks are remote and transparent to the user.
They ask us to trust only them and no one else, because they have certifications (bunch of papers) and wrote all code from scratch. In crypto world inventing the wheel by writing crypto from scratch without community review is usually a very bad practice. 
They say the firmware will be open-source close to shipment, or in another words after we paid them 200$ without refund. Critical problem at that time will leave us with a brick - 200$.
It's the most dangerous kind of products - the opposite of security in secure disguise.

I'll second that. GSM modems and phones are very easy to attack with many open-source techniques (Open-BTS), and from there it is direct path to the crypto controller and stealing our money.
