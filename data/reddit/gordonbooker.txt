I get it that LN will be an amazing technology to enable fast and cheap payments. 
What I can't see yet is why people will want to pay for things in bitcoin when it's (so far) tending to rise in value all the time ?

A humble brag is a brag disguised as humility:
eg. "It was so embarrasing to hear my own track played in the coffee shop this morning"

Do you ever have problems with the banks not allowing local bitcoin bank transfers ? I saw some posts with some people getting bank accounts closed down - but I'm not sure if that still happens ?

Ledger were really good with the bcash fork. They updated the software really quickly to allow you to do what you wanted with the bcash

No, I've never used a Trezor.

As MaxTG says - your easiest option is to just get a new wallet and send your BTC to that. 
If you can afford a hardware wallet - such as Ledger Nano S (can personally recommend), or Trezor - do that.
A free option for a software wallet would be Electrum.
You can even make a paper wallet and use that if you preferred. (Although this would just be to store your BTC - you'd still need to send it back to another type of wallet (hardware or software) in order to use your coin)
