yes. when 100B is added in a day, 100B can be removed in a day. 50B can go away instantaneously.

my portfolio is bleeding at an average of $20 per second. Haha, not worried at all.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:44:13

That's what everyone thought in December 2013. The market cannot be timed. Of course I think the future is the moon for crypto, but Bitcoin could fall by the wayside in favor of another coin (flippening). Truth is anything could happen in this space, be careful with your money

it's an extremely serious situation. you really only should invest what you can afford to lose, it can plummet like this at any moment. 
I decided to take a large risk that would hurt if I lost it, but ultimately I can recoup in a couple years: 19k. I've lost half of that in value on this dip, although I have not sold any of my coins. In the end, I may not lose anything, hodlers of bitcoin have lost a lot in the bear market already from 13-15, and because they hodl'd, they made a lot of money even factoring this dip. You have to think long term and recognize that losses are not permanent until you sell.

If I sell my portfolio now, I will have lost $8,000. That's okay, because I'm young and I can make up for it. I wish I had an appetite for further risk while the price is so cheap though.

FUD and scumbag bankers make me laugh. They are dinosaurs taking their last breath before the crypto revolution completely supplants them.
