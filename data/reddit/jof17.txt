I want money that cannot be manipulated or changed by any single entity or company. I don't want lawmakers, middlemen, or "developers" changing the underlying rules of the currency without consent from all parties.
My definition of a successful decentralized currency is one that I can use to transfer my power to any other human being on earth, without fear of retribution. I want to be able to send bitcoins to islamic state and al-queda, if I so choose, even though I know that those organizations are lost causes. It's the principle that matters.

Nope. No other cryptocurrency has the mining or development infrastructure. And if they did, they would run into the same problems and conflicts. Bitcoin was designed by God to be a one-world global currency.

So if I burn a bunch of USD while playing Monopoly, the value from the USD will transfer into the monopoly money? Wow! That sounds magical. What else can I sacrifice in order to transfer value?

Here's a real-world analogy:
If $FIAT split in 2: The West would have the best leaders, advanced technology and democracy. The East would have dictators, wars and tyranny.
The above statement is false. Here's the kicker... The west needs the east. If America disconnects from Saudi Arabia, America itself will separate into two. Without an outer opponent, the opponent appears within.
Therefore, if Bitcoin splits in 2, each side will experience inner turmoil. Opposition is woven into the design.

The latency issue seems like FUD to me.
Light can travel around the Earth 7.5 times per second.
Or 4500 times per every 10 minute block.

Looks like the venezuelan police are getting ready for their own version of an UASF.

Centralized datacenters won't be necessary until billions of people are using bitcoins for daily transactions. If billions of humans are dependent upon bitcoins, which government is going to "crack down" on the network and potentially destabilize the global economy? Which government is going to invade dozens of datacenters in dozens of countries all over the world? Segwit proponents are spreading fear.
A dedicated user will still be able to run a full node even with 1GB blocks. But that won't be necessary for many years to come. Right now the miners are simply asking for 8MB variable blocks, and they're willing to compromise with segwit. The truth is that with bigger blocks, no one will want to use segwit. Developers want to force the users off-chain just like american lawmakers force users to use fiat.

In other words:
"Former Barclays Chief Says Blockchain and Crypto Could **Reveal The Truth**"

Oh no, wait... My above argument might not work because there's an endless supply of human babies, so the value of a human child is already being depreciated by the increasing birthrate.
Sooooo... If I destroy everyone elses babies then will the value of my baby will go up?

There wouldn't be any slums if there wasn't any debt. People at the bottom suffer for the over-expenditures of the people above.
Take any female world leader and place her at the bottom of society. Take away all the things that empower her, such as her job and her house and her money and her husband and her children. You will then be able to witness how a "powerful" woman can magically transform into a desparate baglady.
Here's a better version:

99% of Bitcoin users are not running full nodes, nor should they have to in order to have a vote. If bigger blocks and segwit were both activated, 99% of Bitcoin users would choose to stay on-chain. In a free market, the masses vote with their money.
The only reason why people would choose to go off-chain is if the blocks are constricted, resulting in artificially increased fees. Devs have to force Bitcoin users off-chain just like Congress forces its citizens to use fiat.
Segwit is Frankencoin. Let the market decide. Let the **people** decide.

So you have to burn something that cannot be counterfeited? Hmmm... What about human babies? Those cannot be counterfeited. And they each have a unique ID. Could I, "theoretically" destroy a human child and transfer its value to myself?

A 1-lane highway with lots of toll booths is the future. ��
If you can't handle the fees, don't drive. ��
Or go use Vitaliks private spaceship. ��

Nobody said bitcoin would make it to the top without a few trials and tribulations. Hodlers will be tested for sure.
Have faith. Profit will lead you astray. Stick with prophet.

I'm a complete newb, but if bitcoin hits $5000 I'll happily pay for the disk space and bandwidth to run a node. I'm sure many others will want to protect their investment as well.
