Bitcoin will make $25K all time high this month.

That's why companies like Ebates pay out cashback once a quarter (every 3 months). To sniff out the fraud. Coinbates follows the same policy.

You're right. I could also have 10,000 BTC and transfer it to 10 different addresses that I own, and it'll show up in these numbers as 100,000 BTC or $388M transacted. These numbers are funky.

Maybe if a large portion of the shares of a company were dumped onto the orderbooks of the spot market, but this doesn't hold true in the case of corporate acquisitions of publicly trading companies, where the buyer pays a premium for all of the shares; and that's a direct case where all the stock is being bought (or offered to be bought).

What is your business model? And sorry that you received zero feedback from this subreddit. It's obvious people only pretend to care about the tech, and are all about pumping their bags and not about the use cases like these...

No but really, this IS good for Bitcoin and crypto in general.

In 2011 no one (few) would have believed it actually became a $100 billion dollar asset.

Is the convenience of their centralized aggregation really worth the risk, when you can just sign up for the lending markets directly yourself?

Uhm, dude. You need to think a little bit more. If someone buys Bitcoin with dollars, the dollars aren't destroyed or removed from circulation, bro.

You could withdraw as USDT, buy USDC or TUSD in another market and redeem those for dollars via wire through the issuer (Circle or TrueUSD).

What a silly comment. Coinbates means coin rebates, their business model is spelled out clearly in the name and has nothing to do with being an exchange like Coinbase. Just have to pay attention to what you're reading.
