Hot stuff. What is the best fractional ownership/token service provider now?

Good one. How did you get the idea?

Definitely. Team Tether is not always as transparent as they could be.

By the way it's kind of the same in the US. It's not that different. The US military and their croonies sometimes visit Google, Apple and other private businesses to ensure that they stay in line and that the managers are loyal to their nation and paying taxes. Communism and capitalism are just two sides of the same thing - nationalism. Same thing applies. Only what is invisible or encrypted is untouchable.

Sure. To answer your question nothing is stopping them. They can take over local pools any time if they want. But it wouldn't necessarily kill Bitcoin.

Well they control the local businesses that operate the miners. But they cannot necessarily do anything they want with the source code. And if they shut down the miners other miners would prevail elsewhere in the world.
There's nothing to prove. The CCP controls all private businesses in China although they don't micromanage every single decision made (yet). And most miners are in China.

Where is that machine? Got Google maps coordinates?

Yes, you understand. Bitcoin is a tool. It can be used for good or evil. It is not good in itself. Just a very powerful tool.
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:36:10
Why would they need to take them over? They already control them. The CCP controls all "private" enterprises in China. Only what is invisible or encrypted is out of their evil hands.

It's more of an underlying threat. At any time they can kill any business there.
