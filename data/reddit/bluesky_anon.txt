My question exactly, after the quick downvote.
What on earth does it bring into the whole discussion?
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:27:04
I'm still hoping to get my 3.86 BTC back

If he did indeed knowingly and willingly and repeatedly lie to customers, that there's no room for assuming he did what he thought would work best for others. 
I am not saying he's more evil than any of us, since we are all sinners, but his deeds are to be condemned and he did cause quite the financial ruin for a good number of people.
EDIT: grammar

So this is the meme that won?
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:07:09
They won't let you withdraw fiat either?

It does make sense sort of, but for those of us who've lost our bitcoins there, it only confirms that there is indeed no hope left (or an infinitesimal one) to ever get them back.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:49:26
No, it doesn't work
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:49:01
Could this somehow find its way to the media?
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:58:28
I had quite a fair amount of hope that things will be resolved.
Of course, it did have a time bomb side to it, as it's been quite suspicious for months now.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:49:13
I hope the media somehow picks this up

I did trade some real BTC to goxBTC, but my funds couldn't be transferred to mtGox unfortunately.
EDIT: I do understand they are manually confirmed. Will wait to see. 
EDIT2: And they are in my mtGox account, got in around 11pm PST as promised.

You could try looking for installed applications such as BitcoinQt or some long strings of incomprehensible numbers and letters, which are the addresses and possibly private keys ("passwords") to the bitcoins there.
And you should also check sign-in info to trading and wallet sites (blockchain, kraken, etc.)

I would tell him that God loves him and there's forgiveness of sins in Christ, in His atoning death. I would do this without any personal interest.
But then I would ask him if I could please get my few bitcoins back.

How is that good news? (serious question)
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:47:46
Thanks, I did :)

It seems that if you remove the 's' from the 'https', it does work. Not sure how safe that is though.

Neither is selfie
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:08:10
Although my user seems to be nonexistent and so does my email address.
I'm still hoping to get back those 1.6 BTCs.

How can someone tweet from prison? And especially a photograph taken in there. Aren't this things strictly forbidden?
