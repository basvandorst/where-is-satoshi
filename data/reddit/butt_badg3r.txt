Congrats! I bought a ps4 pro with part of mine the first time it reached 11k. Up until that time, everyone i knew was calling bitcoin a scam. Now they've seen me actually use it and everyone wants in!

This one worked well! The app kept resetting because i kept switching apps to generate a secure password with LastPass but other than that it looks good! I transferred the contents of my blockchain wallet to Airbitz!

If i said that, everyone with a good experience you say i'm either a moron or making things up!! ... Though the first one is likely to happen anyways on reddit...

Should i move my coins to a different online wallet? Any suggestions on which one to use?

I just tried that one. It wouldn't let me change the currency from USD to CAD. I also tried greenaddress, that one wouldn't accept my phone number for 2 factor authentication. It kept saying invalid pin. I got frustrated and Uninstalled both apps. I seem to be having horrible luck with this..

I need a wallet with an android app.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:53:25
So i'm a little confused by this. Is Jaxx safe or not? If it is not safe, what is a good android app to use instead? Can we have a list of safe android wallets?

We have some ATMs in Montreal but the one I tried asked for a login.. what's the point if you need an account to buy?!

Is this the same as a miner? Will i eventually get bitcoin for running this?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:56:39
this doesn't seem to be an option. unless i'm missing something.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:55:12
Bitcoin really needs to become a standard payment option.

THere's only one person asking way too much in my area. Montreal, Canada.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:41:54
Where can I buy mBTC. mtgox doesn't seem to have that denomination. I live in canada if that helps.

I also bought bitcoin for the first time this week! Internet High Five! o/
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:41:41
Oh wow you're right! Should have tried that earlier! Still waiting to get verified though.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:58:31
Damn it... I'm still waiting for my check to get deposited at VoS!... i wish i could buy right now..
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:02:13
What about setting up a VM for bitcoin transactions? also, do any security measures need to be taken on ubuntu before setting up the wallet? (Armory)
