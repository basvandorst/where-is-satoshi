So a gym might be ok with a year pre-paid.  However, that will be a big number ($600, probably) which will turn people off.
With a credit card, their bread and butter are members who don't cancel because they know they should start going to the gym.  Maybe next week they will do that.  And then they forget about it for another 3 months.
It seems less likely that after 12 months of not going to the gym someone would take the time renew it whereas with a credit card reoccuring billing, you just have to not cancel it.
I'm not sure how disputing the charge for a gym would work out.

I wouldn't call coinbase cold storage.  Cold storage means that no computer connected to the internet has the private keys.  If your funds are in coinbase, they have the keys on their servers and when you log in as you, then your computer has the ability to send your bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:57:07
In general, I avoid keeping funds on exchanges.  The beauty of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust someone else with control of your money.  With exchanges, you are trusting them to hold your bitcoin.
To address your question (poorly), I don't know anything about Bitfinex.

What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:16:57
So p2pool has the mini-blocks for its internal tracking.  Those occur frequently, so a miner need to switch that they are working on often.
This used to not go well with bfl asics but I don't know if it was because of p2pool, cgminer or the bfl protocol.  So a BFL unit would end up working on the old mini-block for longer than it should and not switching to the new one quickly.
My guess is that it was before p2pool implemented stratum for miner communication but I could be wrong.
Now it seems to work just fine.
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:53:16
That is what I have done.
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:53:02
I have a plan for this.  The basic idea is to have a non-block-reward chain that is run in remote locations (like Mars).  So lets say you have an earth chain and a mars chain.  Lets say you have bitcoin on earth chain, you transfer to the mars chain by sending to mars/155H8RYBKNFoqRo4yabRkWr86zTXDzQzCo.  This would be recorded in the earth chain and spendable in the mars chain after a number of confirmations.  Then that address will have a balance on the mars chain and can be used there without talking to earth.  Then it could be sent back to earth, but that would probably require a lot of confirmations because the mars chain will probably be much slower hash rate than earth.
But the important bit is that these other chains don't generate a block reward, only transaction fees from mining.  So there is no inflation in using them and funds in them can be respected as full bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:37:08
Agreed.  However, it is a huge step up from a single sha256 and people want to use brain wallets.  So in this case, I'd say it is a good improvement that might be replaced by something else later.

Gyms make money with monthly memberships that are automatically billed to credit cards and hard to cancel, sometimes with long contracts.  Their ideal member is one who pays for a membership but never actually shows up.
With bitcoin, each of your transactions needs to be signed with keys you should control closely so a monthly reoccurring transaction is not going to work without you giving up some control of your keys.

A paper wallet is generally what someone uses for long term storage and no general spending.
My advise would be to split your funds and use an offline wallet for most of what you have and an easier to use wallet for your spending money.  Think of it like money you keep at the band vs in your pocket.
Anyways, to answer your question, any time you want to actually spend from a paper wallet you need some sort of computer to do math with the private key to sign new transactions.  So the computer (or phone) needs the private key, which means typing it in or maybe scanning it in if you printed a QR code.  That means while the computer is doing that math it has the key in memory and if you have a virus looking for bitcoin things, it could copy it.
A paper wallet is only good if it is never or very rarely loaded on a computer and when it is, it should be a compute that is as protected as possible.

How do you run one of those nodes?  Will p2pool automatically detect username=address and then credit that address?
@_date: 2014-01-01 19:39:14
Indeed.  One of the reasons I started HHTT was because I thought there needed to be more pools and more pool software.  So I ended up making my stratum implementation and releasing it.  However, without having a large bankroll and starting as a PPS pool I don't see how someone would make a new pool.  You need at least several hundred TH/s (and increasing) to be effective PPLNS and if you don't have that, there is no reason for someone to come to your pool.

@_date: 2014-02-10 16:09:44
Depends on how they track transactions they issue.
If someone does the simplest thing, of just create the transaction with a default bitcoind and hope for the best then it works fine.  If they are doing fancy things like checking to see if the transaction gets confirmed (by transaction id) and if it doesn't sending a new one then it would spend all their funds.
In this case, a simpler and safer solution would be to alert on not-confirmed transactions but take no action so it can be investigated.
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:05:22

You make a valid point.  Since I am releasing the sha256 hashes of the secret I am probably revealing a lot or perhaps all of the information needed to figure out what the state of the hash function is before the ".txid" is added.
I don't like using something that doesn't have simple command line tools.  To the best of my knowledge command line hmac functions are not common.  I'd like things to be verifiable by non-programmers.

Even if they can produce them, they probably won't be able to do it instantly.  There will be probably enough delays to stagger the hash rate growth giving the protocol time to adjust the difficulty.  It will be fine.
@_date: 2012-04-17 18:47:43
The operator can always abscond with the pot at any time regardless of anything about the secrets.  I would say the pot belongs to the operator so that is fine.  The question is, are any outstanding or future bets handled fairly?
To me this means evaluating and paying them as appropriate or returning them.  There is of course no guarantee that this will happen but a player could always check how many transactions have been made to the bet addresses without being returned yet.  That is of course not a simple query but if the operator stops paying it would be clear well before a day is up.

When you lose you get half the house edge back, which is about half a percent.
With the normal command line client you can do "sendmany".  I'm not sure about the gui or other clients.
@_date: 2012-09-14 22:38:00
Sure it can, you just need a ton of hashing power that you only run when you want to get a confirm in quickly.
However, it would probably be cheaper to slap every bitcoin user with a $100 bill and say "Uncle Jevon says this transaction is confirmed, wouldn't you agree?  Mr. Franklin here says 0 confirmations is fine for Uncle Jevon."

Yeah, someone sent in this warlock of a transaction with no fee and it is gumming up the works:

Yep.  Depending on how involved the new operator wanted me to be.  The new operation might want to generate all new keys and secrets and have me support only via email or not at all.
However, if the new operator wanted me to actively run things where I would have access to the secrets there wouldn't be a need to regenerate them.  However the cost of making new ones is quite low so might anyways.

And what would you do with 51% of the network?  It isn't like that would let you steal all the bitcoins.  All it would let you do is decide which transactions got in and which didn't and make you powerful enough to orphan anyone else trying to build blocks.

Yeah, it is still a bit grey.  In my state the law defines gambling in terms of wagering for a thing of value.  As BTC can be bought and sold in many places it is almost certainly a thing of value.  It doesn't need to be a currency to have an issue there.
@_date: 2012-07-16 16:24:21
Everyone is talking about the security (against hostile parties) but I think it would be wise to say something about availability.  In the end you have a piece of paper which has value.  If you don't have that paper, you don't have the value.  Consider keeping multiple copies in different locations.  This of course increases your vulnerability to security threats.

For anyone who is watching,
I switched the lucky number calculation to HMAC SHA512 rather than a SHA256 for any bets on 2012-04-11 and later.  This seems to be working well.
I switched from BitcoinJ 0.4 to trunk and that seemed to improve a deadlock issue so processing seems less likely to stall.  But I haven't been running that long so who knows.
I put some more of my own bitcoins in the payout pool to allow some larger max bets.  However, they are still not large.

Yep, is there a simple format for the QR code data that can be read by bitcoin apps?  I'd suggest something terse and still intelegable to humans.
The later informs the app that the amount is not fixed and the user should be allowed to change it.  This would be for tips or donations and the like.
If nothing like this exists, I'll go write it up on the wiki and call it the standard.  I'm pretty sure that is how standards are made.
Ignore me, it is already done and looks coherent:
I'm not entirely convinced that the amount system there isn't confusing as well but meh.
@_date: 2011-07-11 14:16:20
Looking closer at the raw message data, it looks like the addresses are not encoded the same way so there should be a sorting problem with them if they are ever different lengths.
And addresses are sometimes shorter so simply lexicographically sorting the two representations won't always give the desired result.
I guess for now you have to use addresses that are all the same length or *dooom* will occur.
@_date: 2011-08-01 15:09:35
Yep.  A little game along the lines of "I wonder if this deployment will break anything.  Lets setup beta just like our production environment and then do the same steps we are planning to do and see how it goes"
However, it takes a lot of hardware and setup.  
@_date: 2011-07-13 14:51:08
Why are 12 quad cores required to confirm the 2000 tps of transactions?  Isn't each one a public key verify?  I don't know about EC, but with RSA the private key operations are the expensive ones, the public key operations (like verify) are pretty cheap.
Really I'd be more concerned about the bandwidth requirement for all these transactions.
Anyways, I think a problem with what you are describing is that in order to determine that a transaction is valid the bitcoins in question have to be checked against their previous transactions of the sender to make sure the sender has enough coins to do it.  This sender data might be anywhere in the previous chain.
@_date: 2011-08-01 00:40:07
I think I am being stupid and just don't understand how it works.
But regardless: 
@_date: 2011-07-11 15:35:34
Corrected.  Version 1.0.1 sorts by hash160 of the public key in hex rather than the crazy base58 string.
@_date: 2011-07-11 13:57:40
The transaction fee is there to mitigate any additional strain put on by the transaction.  Also, in the scaling section of the wiki they are talking about scaling to the transaction rate of Visa so this should not at all be a problem.
@_date: 2011-08-08 04:20:06
If I understand things right (a big if) if you never sign a transaction with a key nothing on the network knows the public key.  Without the public key, all anyone has it the hash of the public key.  I doubt there will ever be an effective attack that can start from the hash of the public key without being an insane brute force.  So if this is correct, the most secure thing to do is transfer the amount to a new address and never spend from it.

I'm going to assume you are a young professional in the US making less than $120k/yr (or whatver the limit is).  If you open an Roth IRA account and buy bitcoin and bitcoin goes to the moon you won't have any capital gains tax.  It is clear money.  The idea is that you already paid your income tax and are saving for retirement so the government is going to reward you for doing a smart thing for your own future by not charging for any gains on those investments.
Regardless of bitcoin, the gains over 20 or 30 years of working could be pretty large.  Roth IRA + high risk/high reward investments are a fun combo.
Max out your 401k match first, in case your high risk doesn't work out.

I think electrum is pretty great, which is why I've been working on my alternative server for it.  My recent objective has been to get an electrum server running on cheap hardware.  I think a good answer to people concerned about the privacy implications of a light client like electrum is that they can run their own servers.

I think what you are saying is true, however I still don't think it is a big deal.  If we woke up tomorrow and there were only four nodes were being run by slush and 3 jerks, we can ask people to start up some and it would be fixed.  It wouldn't be a problem.
I'm exaggerating of course, but unless people are having a problem finding a good peer then it is worth addressing.

So in some software I made a while ago that had to broadcast a lot of transactions I found several solutions to this problem.
These notes are probably more for software devs of various wallet software.
1) Connect to more nodes.
2) Broadcast to all peers.
3) Broadcast again a little later.
4) Increase fees
I ended up having transaction being send to remote notes who's job it was to connect to many nodes and broadcast the transactions I was trying to get out there.
In the end, I got a setup that almost always successfully got transactions out quickly.

The difficulty of forming a block has nothing to do with which transactions are included or not.  You pick the transactions to include, calculate some hashes based on them and then go.  Beyond the time to initially hash your set of transactions (pretty much zero time) it has no effect.

Boot a live cd linux distro, use electrum to make a new wallet.  Save the 12 word seed on paper.
Save the master public key and use something like  to get addresses for the wallet.
When you need to get into the wallet, boot up the live cd and load it.  Never save it on a hard drive.

Might want to allow new users to only buy a small amount and then if there are no problems after 30 days, let them buy more.
Another option would be doing some fun custom things with the transaction script.  For example, if you set the payment with a script such that it can be spent by you at any time or by the end user after X days.  I'm not sure that is possible, but I suspect it is.

So, as part of the Stratum protocol the mining pool needs to be involved in creating the coinbase transaction, which is what sends coins to the pool.
So to build that coinbase transaction, SockThing needs to know who should be paid when a block is found.  In my case, I am using 4 vanity addresses for fun and then half of the transaction fees go to the user who found the block.
So the regular bitcoind is needed, but funds from found blocks won't end up in the bitcoind wallet unless you specify an address in that wallet as the pay_to_address.
SockThing is the protocol backend only, it just gives out work and stores shares in a database.  Paying people, having a web interface for stats are separate pieces of work.
As for usernames, SockThing has an interface that can be implemented to do whatever you like but on default uses the HHTT model where a username is a ADDRESS_DIFFICULTY.  So the ADDRESS is the user who gets paid for the work and difficulty is what they want to mine at.  See  for some examples.

It is a light client.  It downloads only a small amount of data from some servers to have a view of a particular wallet.  The wallets are based on a seed and and are deterministic.  This means you can save your seed on paper and use that wallet forever without worrying about doing any other backups.  The entire wallet will always be recoverable from the seed.

I didn't mean to imply it had to store the blockchain since your address was first used.  What I suspect is that it downloads each block and scans it for interesting transactions.  If it finds none, discards the block and remembers that the block has been checked.  If it finds an interesting transactions, copies it to a database it keeps.  
The problem with this is that process can take a while if your program has been offline for a while.  I know some guys were working on doing some fun things with bloom filters to make this process much faster but I don't think that is done yet.

I am trying to understand.  It sounds like you are saying that electricity use is approximated due to some complexity and might be fairly far from accurate in certain circumstances.  Ok, so accepting that as true, then the billed kWh is an approximation.  Why does having our approximation be in a strange unit help us?  Why not multiply by 3.6 and then the approximation is in megajoules?  The approximation will still be just as off and represents the same amount of energy.

What they would have to do is in each block pay someone and then after that gets confirmed a few times scramble to build a side chain before that transaction and get it longer.

So at a low level a bitcoin transaction is a set of outputs from previous transactions to spend and a set of output scripts to pay.  Normally these scripts are something along the lines of "Anyone signing this with a private key corresponding with public address X may spend this output"
However, the bitcoin protocol spec allows for more options than that to do special things.  I'm not an expect in that part of the protocol but there may be a way to build some logic like what I describe above.
Edit: here is some information about the scripting language:  
Again, that isn't part of the bitcoin protocol I've messed with so I am not an expect in it.  I expect if you need one, you can post to bitcointalk and find one.

I kinda like that style.  You are done with the string weightedprices once you read your json object out of it.  Why have additional crap hanging around your namespace?
I don't think I'd do that in serious code since it could be confusing but for this I think it is fine.

As has been done by some pool operators, I can refund part of this fee.  I say part because my pool sends half the tx fees to the miner who found the block and I can't speak for whoever that is.

How often do these imports take place?
Electrum is my favorite client and I'd love to see it in debian, but it doesn't seem to justify breaking the normal import process.

The idea of a "Hosted Spare" is actually kinda clever.
Complete bullshit otherwise.  Of course if it isn't they now sue me for libel.  I am unconcerned.

I think the point is the buyer doesn't need anything but the card itself.  Sure, the merchant needs equipment in any case (with exception of cash only sales with no register).

I think I tried it but something about it made me sad but I could be confusing it with a different client.
Looking at it, it appears that you likely have to download every block since the time your keys were created.  Most of those blocks are not interesting but this can still take a while.
Also, as far as I can tell it isn't using deterministic addresses which means you'll need to update your backups whenever you add keys.  (I could be wrong, I am not in a position to run it and see how it works right now)

Why is the "verficiation link" and the bitcoin address the same?
I would have expected the link to do to a website that would show the current balance.  (even just blockchain.info)

A place I give to in Seattle (DESC) has some wet housing which I think they have found to be effective for helping some people.  However, I can see how that would be problematic to get into without substantial community support that it sounds like you don't have yet.

Yes, we can.

I think it would be a violation of the law to not report bitcoin income.  It is up to each person to evaluate the risk/reward of violating that law.  If you think you are unlikely to be caught and the cost of pay the taxes is high you might decide it is worth the risk.  I'm not saying what anyone should do, but don't delude yourself about not reporting income being legal because it is in bitcoin or hens or any other thing of value.

As someone who has worked for Amazon Web Services, I would recommend them.  They are a bunch of smart serious people who know that the entire business is based on having the trust of users and losing that data is a very fast way to lose that trust.
I use AWS Glacier for my personal backups (encrypted by keys only I have, of course).

It shall be done.

Didn't bitcoind default to doing a new address per block?
@_date: 2013-01-03 19:10:48
They had that posted a while ago as well.  Maybe it is a joke.  Can never be sure though.

Nope, that was my only trick.

There is one weasel.  He is powerful and energetic but he gets tired sometimes and hides behind a cloud flare.

I now use one of those big banks because my credit unions couldn't master SWIFT transactions.  One of them had no way to do it.  The other had instructions that didn't make sense.  After one wire being kicked back to me I walked across the street and opened an account.  I told the banker that I was going to wiring in a lot of bitcoin money.  It has been working perfectly.

So they would be paying a percent.  Not like they aren't paying 3% for credit cards.

Yeah, but I'm pretty sure it isn't using any standard floating point representation.  It is using some strange thing that Satoshi nightmared up.
From bitcoinj:
    public static BigInteger decodeCompactBits(long compact) {
        int size = ((int) (compact &gt;&gt; 24)) &amp; 0xFF;
        byte[] bytes = new byte[4 + size];
        bytes[3] = (byte) size;
        if (size &gt;= 1) bytes[4] = (byte) ((compact &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF);
        if (size &gt;= 2) bytes[5] = (byte) ((compact &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF);
        if (size &gt;= 3) bytes[6] = (byte) ((compact &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 0xFF);
        return decodeMPI(bytes, true);
    }
