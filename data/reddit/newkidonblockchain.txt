I'm bullish and hodling, but my average buy-in is $14k and I'm sweating it. I think OP's comments make Bitcoin believers sound like Polly-Annas. So many things could wipe Bitcoin out. I think buying Bitcoin is worth the risk, but it doesn't do anyone any good to pretend it's all puppies and rainbows.

Come join us at r/beardneck. We believe that r/neckbeard has lost track of the original vision of the neckbeard community and that beardneck is the real neckbeard.

Wait, I always thought you should give it 110% when promoting crypto? Was I giving 7.5% too much all this time?

There was no 2014-2016. Anyone who says otherwise is fake news.

Yeah, I'm leaning CSS and this is my first project. I should learn restraint, I didn't want the site to look "plain" so I probably overcompensated. As I learn JavaScript the site will improve.

This is a valid point and one of the big questions that will determine the future of BTC, but I would say that your perspective presumes 1) all transfers must happen "on-chain" and 2) BTC tech development has plateaued. I don't mean to be a Polly-Anna and say "someone will figure out tx fees"- but dude...someone will figure out tx fees.

When I first heard the "bitcoin isn't truly scarce" argument, I wondered if the people making that argument think you can spend any random altcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. I still honestly wonder if they do think that.

I think BTC's value is pretty binary, it's either worth zero or at least $100k. So I don't think it can stabilize at a lower value long term. Of course I'd like BTC to reach $100k through steady gradual growth, but we can't have nice things so I think it will hit $100k too fast and then crash, just as we're seeing with the rush to $20k. And then, like NASDAQ, it will take a decade plus to recover its ATH, at which point it could stabilize long term with liquidity.

In 50 and maybe even by 20 years, quantum computers will probably scoop up those lost coins anyway.

What about a smart contract where benefactor (B) transfers BTC to heir (H) upon death. H is given a key to initiate the transfer and B is given a different key to terminate the contract. The contract gives B notice when H initiates a transfer and a ~1 month option to terminate the contract. 
Scenario 1: B dies. H initiates transfer. B gets email notice, but is dead and doesn't respond. H gets BTC ~1 month later.
Scenario 2: B is alive. H initiates transfer. B  gets email notice and has ~1 month to decide whether to enter his own key to terminate the contract. 
This way B can know BTC will go to H after death, and H has incentive not to prematurely initiate transfer because B would get notice, get pissed off, and have option to effectively write H out of will.

I'm bullish on BTC and think it could be worth $1M "one day," but I've never understood the argument that BTC has inherent value because of the electricity spent mining it. Businesses spend more money developing a project than it's worth all the time. If a studio spends $150M making a bad movie that only grosses $10M, that movie isn't worth the $150M in sunk costs. 
I think BTC has value because it provides a superior way of storing value and transmitting it. If something happened to change that, then all the money previously spent mining it wouldn't provide a price floor.

Chase let me buy BTC with my bank account as recently as a couple days ago. Chase is treating credit card purchases as a cash advance (so does that mean Jamie Dimon is admitting it's a currency?), so yeah, don't do that.

Woodgold is the real gold. Please refer to gold as gold(core) for "clarity."

I agree we're still early, but I'm not sure when the early adoption phase is over. Before ETFs is early. I also think we need better wallets before we leave the early phase. I mean, I think they're fine, but for mass adoption I think we'll need something super ELI5 basic. Like, a way where a BTC address can correspond to a username like "emmasgrandma" with a personalized password, just like an email account. So that I can send BTC to "emmasgrandma" instead of to 1dPkm632,etc.,etc. And yet this wallet needs to be decentralized so that control of the private keys is meaningful.

Good question. I honestly don't know the answer. Atomic swaps would have a "coinbase effect" as anything you can atomic swaps for BTC would be more popular. But it would still have to be something you want to swap for, so those coins would have to have their own, independent merit.

Whenever Bitcoin forks you can always sell the fork and reinvest it in Bitcoin.

I'm optimistic that Bitcoin can replace at least half the market cap of gold. I don't know if it will ever be used on a large scale basis to buy cups of coffee, but I don't think it has to in order to be successful. I can easily see people buying houses and cars and settling other large debts with Bitcoin. Personally, I don't care if that's wasn't Satoshi's vision. The founders of the internet didn't create it so that people could share selfies, but here we are.
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:16:58
My 2 satoshis is that we haven't entered the "normies" phase yet. Like, maybe 2% of Americans have ever purchased BTC, barely any institutional investment, etc. Hopefully one day we will be freaking out when Bitcoin goes from $100k to $20k. But I don't think that will happen for years

I also was going to make that comment. There's no evidence of societies that relied on barter. (Just imagine how awkward it would have been.) There is, however, evidence of gift economies and other similar setups. People provided goods and services and expected to receive something more or less equivalent in return later. The likeliest origin of money is that it quantified and replaced this system of "I owe you a favor." 
I think this illustrates that money is an accounting ledger to keep track of debts. It's not so much a store of value as it is a marker of debt. 
In contrast, people who believe money emerged from barter tend to think that gold has inherent value. Sure, it's used as a semi-conductor and jewelry, but that's only about 15% of its value. Gold is mainly a token that people agree has value. And IMO, Bitcoin is a much better token than gold.

You caught me being sloppy. I should actually learn the specifics of gold's industrial uses before I bandy about terms like "semi-conductor."
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:53:23
Huh? How's this for concern trolling.
Gold is a yellow rock. What is it backed by? Not much. Sure, you can use it as a semi-conductor, you can wear it as jewelry, but that only accounts for about 15% of its value. The vast majority of gold's value derives from social consensus. Gold is basically a unbacked token.
Gold is valuable as a token because it is 1) scarce; 2) divisible; 3) transportable; 4) hard to counterfeit; and 5) fungible. 
Compare Bitcoin to gold and it surpasses it in every category. 1) Fixed supply of 21M; 2) Satoshis are clean and lossless, whereas try dealing with fucking gold shavings (it's messier than a Nature's Valley granola bar); 3) I can send Bitcoin around the world in 10 minutes, good luck mailing gold shavings to China; 4) anyone can instantly browse the ledger on the blockchain, whereas I have no idea if a sample of gold is real or not; and 5) basically same response to 4.
Bitcoin is a much better token than gold and will seriously disrupt its market cap. 
Concern troll over.

Or a government of a developing country could buy a huge chunk of coins, then announce they're using BTC as a reserve currency.
