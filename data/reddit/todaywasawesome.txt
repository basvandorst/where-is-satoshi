Best comment here. 
The risk of accepting Bitcoin at current is small. Maybe 1 in every 1000, or 1 in every 10,000 transactions right now will goto Bitcoin the risk is very small. As adoption goes up, so should stability, and then the risk decreases. 
Offer refunds in the currency paid. Keep a reserve of BTC to hedge bets against returns. If 1% of those paying with BTC do malicious returns it's ok because it will be offset by the press and other savings associated with BTC.

The Wired article includes some info about their complaint on the foreign search. The whole complaint is over 200 pages so I don't know how good their justification is. From wired:
"[The complaint] also points toanother case in which Microsoft was ordered to respond to a search warrantfor emails belonging to one of its users, even though the emails were stored on a foreign server. Ulbricht’s defense refers to that second case as a demonstration that the government ought to seek a warrant even when the information it’s seeking is stored abroad, as in the case of the Silk Road’s Icelandic servers.
“The government has not provided any reason why it could not have pursued, and why it was not obligated under its own theory of the scope of [the law], to pursue the same avenue – a warrant – for obtaining the [electronic stored information] on the Silk Road Server,” the memo reads."

Ok bear with me here. What if you confiscated all Euros in banks. Then you printed Dracmas that are pinned to Bitcoin. You use your reserve of (stolen) Euros to pay for cashouts to BTC from the Dracma. 
The f everyone rushed to cashouts to BTC it would cause the price to swell making the Dracma "go up" as well. The problem would be if they approached their limit on Euros and the confidence is lost then they wouldn't be able to afford to keep it pinned and it would collapse. 
But if you had the reserves and were able to keep confidence you'd be OK. Since it would be a reserve based currency you could still offer small stimulation or pull back when needed but you wouldn't have unfettered access to create a deflationary spiral. 
Is this a totally stupid idea?

@_date: 2015-04-21 17:30:20
Yes. It is exactly the same thing. In this case I don't know why you wouldn't judge it by its effects because the effect is the same.
The reason that Greece or Cyprus consider stealing from bank accounts is because they don't have the power to print money. The euro won't let them. The advantage of having separate currencies in an economic fallout is that suddenly everything in the country is discounted relative to their neighbors. This incentivizes foreign investment because you get more bang for your buck.
Greece is in a really tough spot because they acted like they were in charge of their fiscal policy when in fact they weren't. The eurozone is. 
In the US, we can print money (and do) in order to make up for budget shortfalls. It makes all the money we have less valuable through inflation. If they confiscated 20% of my savings, or inflated the dollar 20% the effect on me is the exact same. They have robbed me.
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:35:39
Good comment. I hadn't thought of that. 
A 401k can be setup however you want. It is not a sample of the entire economy by default. If your 401k is primarily made of mutual funds and money market accounts then sure (though I believe even money markets are susceptible to inflation if its high enough.) But if you're buying CDs you're not very well equipped for inflation you are mostly right though.

They are the same. Either can be devastating or not a big deal. 
If the govt takes $5 from every bank account its not a big deal. On the other hand, if they empty everyone's accounts then it's a huge deal. 
Same thing. If they print  enough money for 2% inflation, its not a huge deal. Of they print enough that we're using wheel barrows to go shopping then yes, its a very big deal.

I think Bitcoin right now is a lot like the Internet in 1995. It has lots of really interesting potential but it's not nearly as easy or interesting to use as it will be.
Here are a couple of things that I can think of off the top of my head
* Micro-transactions make a lot more sense. The rise of the bitcointip bot has been really cool to see. Being able to do that is pretty rad.
* Internationally standard currency. It's very cool to see how many places across the globe accept Bitcoin. I like to travel and being able to use Bitcoin anywhere would be great.
* Public record transactions. This next election we'll see campaign financing through Bitcoin and I think there are a lot of transformative aspects of allowing everyone to track funds.
* Retailers don't have to be PCI compliant for Bitcoin. Lots of people already use Stripe because compliance is very expensive and hard (which is fine) but it's pretty cool that you don't have to do it with Bitcoin and you don't have to worry about the security of your retailer when paying (like cash).
* You can create backups of private keys. You can't backup cash, you can just put it in a bank (which you could still do with BTC). It's just an extra option.
* Bitcoin is inherently deflationary so it should (in the long run) be a good store of value compared to other currency which is always loosing value.
* Payment processors are optional. If you want protections from Bitpay and help with things you can use them but if I wanted to start a lemonade stand tomorrow I could just put up a public address and call it good.
* Peer to peer payments made easy. In Norway this isn't a problem because bank accounts already act like public addresses to which anyone can wire money, but in the US that's missing. I like Square Cash a lot but Bitcoin does that without any third party.
* Bitcoin's inherent structure is likely to lead to other more interesting breakthroughs. Namecoin or coloredcoins both come to mind. What will we think of in 5 years based on this revolutionary public blockchain idea?
* Paying with BTC is really slick. I think it's easier than using a CC and it's definitely easier than a check, paypal, or bank wire.
* Pooled transactions are interesting. "Hey everyone, contribute to Sarah's college fund, here's the address!" Doing that with traditional means is a little more difficult. Try setting up a bank account to raise money for someone, it's a pain.
* Totally immune to counter fitting. No need for a secret service.
I dunno, I think there are so many possibilities we haven't even scratched the surface on yet.

| If there is a majority amongst the miners, they can do that.
~~A majority of miners cannot reverse a transaction. A majority of computational power can reject a transaction and not record it but there is no way to reverse a transaction.~~ I amended this question to be "Any Bitcoin Miner". You're right, in the real world this acts like a reversal even though on the Blockchain this would look like the transaction never taking place. 
| Is a bit sketchy, since, as fair as I know, most nodes still run with the "official" open source program which gives that group a bit chunk of power.
Yes but ultimately Bitcoin is a protocol and everyone is free to ignore the Bitcoin foundation. If they disappeared tomorrow progress would go forward.
| They must take it on, but they can mitigate it using third party services.
Disagree, using bitpay you can do a 100% conversion from BTC to $$ and defer all risk.
| Paper wallets? The house can burn down, they paper can be lost, stolen or physically damaged. I'm not convinced it is a lot better than my rooted phone.
Here the answer leaves a little wiggle room by specifying that it is generally accepted that paper wallets are the safest place. Really paper wallets should have a backup (like multiple copies stored in different places). Hopefully this will change with better wallet security.
| In which of the following ways is Bitcoin different from traditional currency like the US dollar?
I don't think the price of electricity and network difficulty would figure into the currency not being fiat. The US dollar is fiat currency but we have to spend paper and ink to make it. See the [r/Bitcoin FAQ](

I was going to say it's not a reversal but a refusal to record the transaction but in the real world that acts like a reversal. I think I'll have to amend that question. 
Changed it to be "Any Bitcoin Miner" as to exclude a large network attack. Any bitcoin miner can refuse to accept a transaction but some other miner will pick it up unless it's a big network attack.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:00:51
If you made a paper wallet and then sent 20 BTC to the address on that wallet then you wouldn't be storing the Bitcoins in offline storage. Right?
Later, your burns down and the wallet is lost. Do you still have those Bitcoins?
If your wallet is lost, then your Bitcoins are lost.
I understand the technical subtleties here but from a use standpoint there is no confusion. Your Bitcoins are stored in wallets.
Again the question was: What is a Bitcoin wallet?
The available choices were:
* An account used for escrow
* A ledger
* Software that records account balances
* A place used to store Bitcoin
Of those options there is only one possible answer. It's not an account used for escrow (though you could use a wallet for this purpose). It's not a ledger, that's the blockchain and as we already discussed wallets do not have to store the blockchain. It's not software that records balances because wallets don't have to be software, and "account" balances are stored on the blockchain.
The feedback then clarifies what it means to "store Bitcoin" by adding:
| Bitcoin wallets contain addresses that "store" funds and corresponding private keys that allow the spending of Bitcoin.

One of my favorite aspects of Bitcoin is that it doesn't require you to give any personal information to retailers. All they get is your public address and the funds.

lol I don't think you should.
Remember, bitcoin is a currency, just like the US dollar is a currency. The US dollar doesn't have financial protections. If someone steals your cash the fed won't print you new ones.
Your credit card company is a third party that provides a lot of services to help you with your US dollars. Exchanges, online wallets, escrow services, whatever, are third parties that help you with your Bitcoin. 
The big advantage of Bitcoin isn't that it has low fees (though for international transfers that is a huge bonus), or that you won't use third party services (bitpay has lots of great features). 
Bitcoin isn't trying to compete with credit cards, it's competing with other currencies like the US dollar, Euro, or the Yuan. Saying the currency is weak because a third party service built around it breaks is like saying the US dollar is flawed because credit card companies get hacked.
It doesn't make any sense, and people try to compare it that way all the time, hence the joke. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:34:23

In all practical use your private keys are your Bitcoin. If you lose your private keys then you don't have any Bitcoin. If you give your private keys to another then they have your Bitcoin. 
Your wallet doesn't have to store transactions in order to be a wallet. Paper wallets do not have any part of the blockchain but they still qualify as wallets. Just because Bitcoin QT stores the blockchain doesn't mean every wallet does.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:12:01
I agree with most of your points but would counter that some of these were deliberate for the sake of having questions and answers that weren't extremely long. 
I disagree about Bitcoin not being deflationary. Inflation is a function of supply and demand. Eventually there will be a fixed number of BTC which given a constant demand would make it neither inflationary or deflationary. However as population increases and coins are lost the supply of Bitcoin will have to be spread among a larger group of people making it increase in value.
I guess I could add an asterix that Bitcoins only deflate in value when the Bitcoin Economy is growing.

I think I agree with you. I've wanted to use BTC-e to day trade but the only way I see to do it is to buy on Coinbase, transfer the coin, cash out but keep it in BTC-e and then buy/sell at will. I think CampBX is the only other option in the US but I haven't tried it.

I think you're splitting hairs here.
Previous to 1971 the US dollar was directly convertible to gold. Since then the currency has been considered fiat. Going by the wiki definition
The US Dollar
✓ - any money declared by a government to be legal tender
✓ - state-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value of terms of any objective standard
✓ - money without intrinsic value
X - any money declared by a government to be legal tender
X - state-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value of terms of any objective standard
✓ - money without intrinsic value
To me the key feature of a fiat currency is that it is not backed by a physical commodity. It was move to remove gold backing from the US dollar that led us all to call it a fiat currency. Bitcoin is not tied to some physical commodity like gold.

You seem to think that there is no financial repercussions from having your CC stolen. There are financial repercussions but the financial implements are more advanced and spread the risk.
