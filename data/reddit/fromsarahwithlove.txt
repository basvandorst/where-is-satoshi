Thanks.  
My reasoning is this - before november there are some speculative news coming out of various altcoins, so... I will have to know what am i gonna do if A happens or what if B happens... This planning will help you to keep emotions down and focus.

There were other posts about loan taking as well, but that doesnt matter. We need shit load of them.  
But people also took out second mortages on their multiple homes in 2006 and look what happened. Just saying... Some time in the future we might have a similar thing here. People taking loans to buy a product that keeps on gaining value cause everybody wants to get rich, just like 10 years ago.  
Besides that there are a lot of important things to consider. Anyways if the time comes are you ready to run?

the same was about bch blocksize, every now and then you would see spikes to 4mb in blocksize and everybody at r/btc cheering, even thogh it lasted only hours.

well clearly just saying it does not make it that way, but when a lot of people are starting to take loans to buy btc then... if only we had statistics on this
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:00:15
yes, i think btc will rise 10x more til it bursts.

And the best part:  


So basically they can say whatever they want about tether and it wouldnt be lying- it would only be an inconsistency if it didnt match the legal document.
