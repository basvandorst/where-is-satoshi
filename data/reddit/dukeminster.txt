Just to let you know, I used bitcoinplus when it first came out, I completely forgot about it until last month. I mined as much as I could and had about 0.6 BTC, but at the time bitcoin wasnt worth so much so I just forgot about it. Then last month when I reliased what is was worth I logged on again to see my 0.6 BTC still there. I withdrew tried to withdraw it to my personal wallet there and then. But I never recievecd it. Then a few days later the site went down. After doing some researching I thought the site probably wouldnt come back and my money was lost, but I still emailed the owner. (i didnt get a reply) so a month later (today) i logged on to my account and found that my balance has been returned. So i tried another withdrawal straight to my cryptsy account this time, and it appears to have worked. I beleive he has worked on the automatic payment process. You now have to confirm the withdrawal via your email address. Its now in the blockchain and im waiting for it to appear in my cryptsy account now. It is showing as a pending transaction on the cryptsy account and as a completed withdrawal on bitcoinplus.

I actually had 0.617 BTC in my account, but for some silly reason I withdrew 0.61 meaning I received 0.60. So now I have 0.007 BTC still in the bitcoin plus account that I cant withdraw until it is over 0.01! Not to worry though, im just glad I suddenly have £270 out of nowhere...and the few quid still left in my account is neither here nor there. 
One other thing to note: The payout given for a block is significantly lower than when I started. Thus rendering mining on Bitcoinplus completely useless. For example, the first coin generation I received was on the 8th September 2011, and I was rewarded 0.00002728 BTC for it. Generate a coin now and you receive 0.00000002 some 7000% lower reward. For anyone reading this, stop mining and pull out your money.
