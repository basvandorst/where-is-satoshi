It sounds a little you’re saying “this time it’s different” which makes me wary.

Tulipmania is something of a myth. There were expensive (rare) tulip bulbs sold to and traded amongst the wealthy merchants of the day, but it did not occur across the entirety of Dutch society. 
When the fad finished it did not cause a financial crisis, more a crisis of expectations/trust. People had promised to buy certain bulbs at certain prices, but there was no way to hold them to the arrangement.

Cool stuff but agree with the shortcomings people have noted.
The current symbol is closer to a standard currency symbol like $, €, £, ¥. This suggests that bitcoin is part of that family of currencies... which probably helps it feel more familiar and legitimate if you don’t know much about it. 
If bitcoin is already different do you represent its challenge to orthodoxy as in your design, or go the other way and make it conventional? 
Interesting design problem...

So now you’ve had the experience of moving money outside of the regular financial system.
No government or bank controls or can touch that money. You could carry it into any country in the world. Send it to anyone, anywhere. All with a very high degree of privacy. 
If that sounds kinda interesting it’s worth doing some reading on the topic. The technology, ethos and thinking that has gone into the system is interesting in itself.

Assuming the whole story is for real, the only way this can work out ok now is IF he holds bitcoin for a longer time and IF the value goes up enough to cover his losses. But in the mean time he still has to service a 20k loan and live with the stress. 
Or, if he does cash out of bitcoin now, he has to live with the price when it goes up.
Case study in facepalm...

I did some casual mining a few years ago. Wasn’t worth the return (using cpuminer in the days of gpuminer), and I didn’t even have a wallet set up to get my teeny tiny cut from the pool.
Oh well...
When the dot com bubble burst Apple’s stock went to $10. I was looking at it around $13, but a work colleague convinced me it was a bad idea because Apple was “in a lot of trouble” and the education market was drying up. At that point I had 10k sitting around and few responsibilities. 
It basically boils down to coulda woulda shoulda. 
Reality is that hindsight is 20/20, and we couldn’t wouldn’t didn’t, and so here we are. 
No point crying about it now. Just learn from it and  look forward.

@_date: 2017-11-19 07:55:38
It’s a real mind shift. If he’s not being dicky about it... sit down with him, set up a wallet, ping him a few satoshi, and talk about it. 
I had read about Bitcoin and done some very casual mining years ago, but until I went through that experience of moving some money out of the conventional financial system, into bitcoin, and having a wallet... I didn’t really get it. 
Whether or not the value goes up or down, it’s certainly interesting, and once you’ve been through that experience and considered the potential, it’s far easier to understand the value of a trustless, decentralised system that is a currency, payment system and ledger all rolled together.
Especially when you can point to use cases like Venezuela etc where bitcoin can make a real difference and live up to the promise of being “the people’s money”.

From 7000 to 7400 is roughly 5.7%, and 5.7% of 85 is roughly 5
Also the value of bitcoin vs a given currency will fluctuate as the currency itself changes.

In the USD example printing endless dollars is inflationary. I think OP is suggesting the opposite could be true for bitcoin. You mention smaller increments of bitcoin could be introduced if needed. This is what OP is referring to when saying bitcoin is not a fixed currency. I mean, it is currently, 21m max split down to the satoshi. But hypothetically...

Did you see this story from the other day? 
A least some of the people getting burned (assuming they sell at current prices) are just regular folk, trying to do better for their families etc. It’s a little hard to reconcile that with people like Steve Wozniak who bought at $700 and sold near the top. Presumably the guy doesn’t need more money.
I get that Bitcoin went into mania and that this is how these things play out. But...
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:27:10

Hey thanks for the link! Anton is a great speaker. I guess my question becomes: if people are existing outside the financial system, how do they financially contribute to the wellbeing of their society?
I guess it would vary. Say for people getting paid in a local currency they would still pay taxes on their earnings. 
But for people getting paid in bitcoin; existing outside the system - do they pay tax voluntarily? 
I get that we can make a case that the wealthy, governments and banks have in many instances broken the social contract. But what’s the end game or intention for bitcoin as an agent for social change?

Say your wages go to bitcoin, and imagine bitcoin was relatively stable in price, i.e. it behaved more like a regular currency where the value is solely diminished by inflation. What has changed? What’s different? There’s still going to be taxes etc.
