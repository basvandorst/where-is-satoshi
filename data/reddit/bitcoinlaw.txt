Maybe they own even more now.

While the boom and bust may reflect "reasonable concerns" about the global economy, this doesn't mean Bitcoin is able to address such "reasonable concerns."  We all hope that it actually does address concerns and functions as a currency; and even more that the Bitcoin bubble is not simply an expensive expression of frustration or concern.

I don't work for bitcoins, but I am a lawyer :)
I've been doing some research on exchange liability. Lots of issues to overcome -- not least of which is that Mt Gox operates out of Japan.  Feel free to get in touch.

Sure. And hopefully things will work out for individual customers of Mt. Gox.  If you hold bitcoins there, you could move them to CampBX or any other exchange.  If you hold dollars in Dwolla that you intended to transfer to Mt. Gox, you can transfer them anywhere else (including back to your bank).  This is only seizing Mt. Gox's account, so individuals with dollars in Dwolla or Bitcoins in Mt. Gox are presumably safe.  USD in Mt. Gox will probably not go back to Dwolla directly, so other U.S.-based exchanges that haven't been frozen  should theoretically see a boost in incoming bitcoins from Mt. Gox wallets when U.S. based customers want to cash out.
The bigger worry, I would suppose, is if there was a huge amount of money in Mt. Gox's Dwolla account.  They could get into further trouble if they don't have cash reserves to settle all their accounts.

Very true.  Unlike e-gold, there is no central point of failure (touted as one of Bitcoin's advantages).  However, if average users in these still-early days of Bitcoin can't get money in and out of dollars, it may dampen the Bitcoin movement and exacerbate the volatility of the currency.

Great question -- especially since bitcoin is intended to be anonymous.  It seems like just a gag, since they'll have to take all kinds of reporting data no matter what form the donation comes in.  The bigger question is when will a Super-PAC start taking Bitcoin?

That still didn't answer the question of which exchange you list.  Given today's "market cooldown" and yesterday's madness, that seems like an awfully good question.

Right -- the trading platform has to actually function as a trading platform. Mt. Gox (and others) take on the contractual responsibility to users to actually have a functioning platform -- even if the underlying currency could be traded so many other ways or through other exchanges (i.e. nonexclusivity).   Their own terms and conditions provide that they will "use all reasonable care and skill in facilitating the matching of offers of the Members on the Site via the Platform to conclude Transactions" and "it shall comply with any and all laws and regulations relating to offering the Platform."  
Each user of Mt. Gox has a contract with Mt. Gox for them to use their professional judgment and experience to run the exchange properly and legally.  If they can't do it, they've breached that contract.  If what it takes to actually comply with their contractual obligations is to make substantive changes to the way the exchange operates, they ought to do that.

They claim to comply with the law, though I couldn't immediately find their license on the Georgia website.
