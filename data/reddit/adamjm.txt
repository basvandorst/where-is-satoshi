You can be damn sure the government knows they control the entry points. Until mass adoption of crypto for payments you need two way transfers between crypto and FIAT. 
For the technology to move forward we need both regulated entry points AND decentralized exchanges. That way the market can flourish, merchants can accept payments, consumers can convert their currency knowing that money can come in but not be forced out and it can always be exchanged for goods and services.   
Only then can we reach tipping points where more business is done in cryptocurrency than any other and the balance of power will shift.

What I mean is there was supposed to be a technological solution to make it impossible for government to interfere. What has happened is Gov has targeted the entry points. The exchanges are the weak link and that can stall any further investment in crypto. It can't replace money without you being able to make the trade from FIAT to crypto. Essentially China can and has started to block funds via bank controls.

Fair enough, the proof of its longevity will be in how it scales.

Do not invest now. Wait. It is blowing up right now based on a misunderstanding of how each coin resulting from the fork will be treated. It will NOT be like bitcoin cash. There will only be one coin that is viable. Much of this pump is people who refuse to believe it or just still assume.
When the penny drops so to speak, we'll see a correction and you'll know it when it happens.

When the exchanges can't be shutdown and when citizens can't be prevented or punished for buying crypto then there will be confidence. The news from China and the subsequent dip is due to crypto failing to deliver on its promise of freedom from government interference and control.

That isn't what I meant by scale. Its speed of transactions it can handle per hashrate of the bitcoin network.

I would spend the time doing some reading about the top 5-6 coins. What problems their technology plans to solve and what backing they have and the moves they are making. That'll give you an understanding of why they are where they are. Bitcoin is the 'popular' one, the most well known 'brand', so in my opinion I always take any big rise with a grain of salt. Its like 80% hype 20% tech, I prefer things the other way around.
