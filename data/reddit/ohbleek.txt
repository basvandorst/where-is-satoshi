Hi, I'm the mailman for Coinbase and I just want to confirm the rumors: I delivered the shutoff notice for the electricity at Coinbase today.

where can i buy it with bitcoin?
EDIT: I suppose I can use purse to buy it on amazon
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:50:55
I use bitcoin core, so does that mean I am a node? or should I go to r/bitcoinbeginners to ask this?
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:25:10
Excellent. Thank you. I have been trying to learn as much as I can about bitcoin and the blockchain lately and I  haven't found a source that begins at the level I need. I've paid for many things with bitcoin and I get the very basic idea of the blockchain, but when I try to understand the more technical aspects, I am lost.  I'll check these out after work.  
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:11:11
This is far more than what I have a knowledge about.  What is a good source for learning about this?

This scenario, IMO, sets up the complete opposite conclusion. No SEC head = no ETF.  New head needs time to review everything "left on the desk"
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:50:10
This might be one of the most honest comments I've seen on this sub. It perfectly illustrates the struggle of "I want every life to be improved and the fall of the elite by bitcoin but also I wanna get mine"
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:22:17
Outside of any implications, there doesn't seem to be anything here other than a statement that the ETF was discussed. There is truly nothing else in this document.

@_date: 2016-01-14 15:45:56
Agreed. There is a big opportunity for growth within the latino community here in the western United States.  I think about it everytime I walk past the corner store that has a constant flow of people buying calling cards for Mexico. I just don't know enough about bitcoin to get anything going. Someone will tap into it.
@_date: 2016-03-12 20:11:46
oh this is good
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:13:54
Interesting.  This does help me understand why they are opposing segwit, or rather Core.  As a btc supporter its frustating to sit on the sidelines and see how this can affect the community while feeling that I don't have a dog in the fight. At least not directly.  Like everyone else I'd like transaction time and fees to decrease in order to allow for greater adoption, I'm fairly neutral on how that is accomplished.  I'd like to run full node but recognize I don't have the money to dedicate the hardware to do it, so at this point, increasing block size isn't relevant to me anymore. Having 1 MB blocks already excludes me from doing so. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:57:08
Can you post some evidence to backup your claims? I don't doubt any of it but I read things like this a lot and I'd like to know where it comes from. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:06:44
OK that makes it a bit more clear. Then are you saying the proper solution would be implementing segwit and allowing a block size increase?
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:37:40
Well if we re being honest, coinbase is a mostly terrible company in every aspect of the Bitcoin exchange experience.

@_date: 2016-03-16 23:52:54
That is literally what coinbase is. you put in your debit card and buy bitcoins. I'll do it right now. Just bought $200 of bitcoin. wow. that was easy.

I hope blocksy bay becomes a reality, cool idea.
@_date: 2017-03-29 03:34:06
And it is pointless.  It is a false comparison to believe that bitcoin and eth are competitors. Eth will never be used as a global currency for the trade of goods and a store of wealth.  Eth is unique, it is revolutionary, it is not a currency.  However, people trying to  make a quick buck have decided it is a competitor while developers and tech geeks have embraced it for the technology that it is.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:23:04
I agree. Although, I haven't seen a post that only consists of a link to their statement, only interpretations of their statement by the OP.

Compromise is necesssary to regain the trust of the user base at this point.  The ideals of bitcoin are what led to my investment and hodling.  If those ideals are replaced by the contention we've seen lately, I'll jump ship and wait for the anarcho-capitalist crypto coin of my dreams to be created by a brain much more gifted than my own.

There's nothing to worry about because there is no recourse. He is allowed to sell them and I hope he does. We don't need these kinds of malicious actors thinking their fat wallet can issue threats. Price would dip and we'd all buy more btc than we ever thought we could own. I hope he sells, it would benefit everybody.

There's definitely a bullshit detecting curve. For the longest time I couldn't tell who was full of it and who had comments based on info and not just dark of night speculation. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:44:54
part of that comes down to there being few merchants that accept bitcoin. That and most people spend money at amazon, the grocery store, and the gas station. Those will be the last places to accept btc.
Anytime I see a vendor accepting btc I use it, and I'm a regular hodler
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:27:58
My comment may have been understood incorrectly, I wasn't saying you're description is wrong.  I just thought it was an interesting and odd way of describing a short. 
 I'd describe it as a bet that the price would go down. Which is pobably too simple to be accurate.
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:26:52
Thank you for posting this list. Very useful for people to get an idea of the options to buy and sell. Reduces the illusion of there being 1 or 2 exchanges. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 05:32:41
I have seen this community become very insular and cliquey at times. However, there are also many regular posters in this sub that are extremely helpful and kind.  The issue stems from the very nature of the sub; this sub works as a catch-all for the entire bitcoin community.  Really though, that is what I love about this sub.  It feels a bit voyeuristic at times, as I watch experts chime in occasionally, read overhyped theories from btc domination fanatics, and check on the latest news (and bickering) in the industry. 
This is a great reminder though, as last week I had two close friends contact me specifically to hear about how they can buy/use bitcoin.  That's two more than I've had in the past six months, coming to a total of 4 for the year.  These are mainstream guys, not tech geeks or even tech enthusiasts. A new wave of participants has found its way to the btc experiment and I hope they are met with the enthusiasm and energy many of us were met with 4, 5, or 8 years ago.

@_date: 2017-01-01 20:24:49
I'm a bitcoin believer and yet, I can't help the fact that the above is probably accurate.  However, I don't think that the above situation necessarily means that Bitcoin will fail as a global currency or store of wealth.  What do you think? Is bitcoin doomed because of the situation or can both scenarios hold true (early adopters become wealthy while Bitcoin also succeeds)?
@_date: 2017-01-01 16:51:32
Simply put, no. You should be looking at how to diversify your investments.  When the price was &lt;$400 it was a good idea, but now, absolutely not.  What if there is a hard fork and a major price drop?  What if a major government bans its use?  
Right now you're young and rent free, living with your parf ents.  But if the crpyto market crashes, you'll be living with them through your 30's.

I believe that this is the real cause for the recent rise in price.  Miners are holding more coins causing a false scarcity and resulting rise in price.  Likely they are planning ahead for the price drop after a hard fork. 2017 will be a rough and unpredictable year for btc.

this "no true scotsman" attitude pervades the sub, and wide adoption may not be realistic, but it is never going to even see the horizon of possibility if we don't adopt an attitude similar to what the dogecoin community  had a year ago, a spirit of welcome and willingness to educate - minus some of the silliness they had, which was fun though

@_date: 2016-09-19 03:07:44
I view bitcoin in the same way that I do the early internet.  When the world wide web was introduced, the idea of being connected to computers via your phone line sounded really cool but it wasn't useful to the average person, just your tech enthusiasts and those working in tech. 
The internet became fun and useful once it had applications for its use that pertained to the average person.  Things like ebay, messaging, email, porn, etc... These were reasons to use the internet. 
Bitcoin will be foundation that use cases are built upon.  Most of those use cases are not clear to us yet, but as technology moves forward and people need new ways to make life efficient, bitcoin will be the platform used to deliver upon that need.

Attack of the normies is spot on though.  I work in science/tech so most people I know are similar personality types.

This misses the point. They pushed him into being a 'criminal' because if he had appeared in court and allow his arrest he would have been extradited and he'd be rotting in gitmo. This is a classic tactic to propagandize and politicize an issue to create a 'criminal' out of a journalist.

Yes this makes sense to me. Tbh I was fairly certain I already understood all of this but when people skew the technical implications to fit their narrative or personal belief I have difficulty separating opinion from fact.

Your points are valid but it's still naive to believe that he wouldn't be extradited to the US despite having never committed a crime here. How do we know that? How many people have skipped bail and Scotland Yard kept round the clock surveillance for years outside of their residence?

They dont use  "right wing nationalist" and just list "nationalist" for le pen and then use the term "left wing nationalist" for others. I don't care what their political leanings are but don't be a fucking hypocrite.  Then they try to spin their bullshit into sometHing about Bernie sanders in the comments. It's pretty....well, stupid.

wow thanks! I laughed pretty hard when I read your comment and I couldn't decide if I should wait for you to finish shitting or not before I replied.

I think this is obvious by now. It would be incredibly naive to believe that institutional money isn't investing in btc.  The finance sector isn't known for following regulations and if there's money to be made they will find a way to invest.  I'd wager that most of the large buys are occurring off chain and outside of exchanges. 
There is a general perception here that institutional money still hasn't started flowing in but I'd imagine a great deal of that money started buying up coins years ago. That isn't to say that there isn't plenty more money waiting to get in to the crypto space but we can no longer assume there's some great windfall of institutional money waiting to pour into crypto.

I have several friends who have recently asked me about getting into the crypto space.  The comment they have all made is that "Eth is still cheap and it seems like it has a lot of room to grow, **BUT** I don't know anything about this stuff what do you think?"
The people I know that are buying Eth don't know anything about crypto currency **AND** they don't care, it's all short term speculation and they'll ditch the second the bubble looks like it's going to pop or more likely when it already has. 
All that said, I don't know what the implications of Eth replacing BTC in market cap will be, but I believe it will happen soon and it could have interesting consequences, possibly being the pin that pops the bubble.

Yeah it's odd.  It must be some kind of joke or statement. If it was a scam they'd at least have a site for people to spend their money.

I have a free laptop and the day off. If I can get this done before lunch then you can count 1 to the ranks

I like how you're explaining this. Can you explain more then about why the btc market cap isn't an accurate metric?

I love this thread. HODL til your ODL.

I think you could just write down your seed with instructions and place it in a safe or a will.

The only fool is the one left standing with no Bitcoin because he thought he could time the market. 
Buy when you can. Everybody that has bought and held has benefited.

I can't figure out if this is a joke or not.  It appears there is no website listed on the ad, only an email address.  The google results list a facebook page first and a twitter.  Even the subreddit is a ghost town with 3 posts, indicating it is "bitcoin for cats."
