I have bought:

* Games (Most PC humble bundles)
* Shaving soap
* Pizza
* Some donations
Tonight I will be buying more Beer with Bitcoin. It's pretty quick and simple, but I am wary about how it will work in a much busier environment (like a club, rather than a bar). However, I think that's a solvable problem (they did it with wireless credit card-readers).

20 BTC is a lot. Why put it all into one competition? 
Maybe one competition per quarter this year. 5 BTC is enough to attract a lot of people. That way, we could target different areas. One video, one gaming, etc.

Well the wizard advert was successful, but that was relatively cheap ($140 apparently). My point was, don't stick all of your eggs in one basket. I'd rather see the money split into a few different campaigns, rather than one huge one. My original comment suggested 4 sponsored competitions over 2014. That's about $4,500 per competition at today's exchange rate. 
You are right though. It would be better to do something rather than nothing.

I'm not saying all right leaning groups are hate groups. I'm saying the EDL, specifically, is a hate group. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:47:10


The EDL was always a racist organisation. Even in the days when Tommy was in charge. They would bus groups of their supporters to towns that they had little involvement in and chant mostly racist things. 
It got bad enough that these towns started closing down their town centres and most shops would end up boarded up for the day, after seeing the destruction caused in other towns. 
No exaggeration, they were hooligan trash, and always have been. 
Even if Tommy has had a change of heart, he shouldn't be forgiven for the amount of racism he spread. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:32:26
I have witnessed an EDL rally under his leadership, yes. 
They are a hate group. 
Also, in one breath you're staying they're not a hate group, and then you go on to say Tommy thought they were too extreme. Which is it? 
If Tommy has turned over a new leaf, good for him. But in 2010, he was leading a racist rally for a racist group. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:31:56
He founded the EDL, which is just a hate group, made up largely of Football hooligans looking for fights.

You're right, there are a lot of situations where it is free to transfer money where Bitcoin would cost you. 
But with Bitcoin it's a flat fee for everything. If I wanted to send Btc to my flatmate it would cost the same as if I were to send it to Alaska. This is what's attractive for me - being able to send money globally, cheaply - and more than that, it's easy. I wouldn't need to use a different method depending on where I'm sending the money. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:43:46
That is a great point. But I don't see a real difference between the exchanges taking a cut, rather than say, PayPal or credit card companies.

No you don't. Hence why they have a buy and sell price which are different. Certain credit cards do offer perfect exchange rates though. 
Yes, bank fees exist in Bitcoin, but it's a fairer system IMO. You can also just choose not to pay them and have a slower transaction. 
Banks still make their money out of you, even without fees on simple transfers.

$1.2 billion is about 8,000,000 BTC at today's exchange rate (I'm not sure exactly how much turnover was made in BTC, considering the change in exchange rate). There are less than 12,000,000 BTC in existence right now. That is a lot of volume for one site. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:03:17
Except, from what you're saying, there was no reason for the BTC price to ever rise. Your point is entirely your own guess work, and there is no logic or proof behind it. 
With the amount of businesses accepting BTC now, they actually have a much more legitimate use.

Hypothetically, if internet in the whole US were to shutdown, the dollar would probably lose a lot of value (I'm not sure how the failure of the internet in the US would affect actual running of the internet worldwide, I'm just basing this on how many businesses rely on the internet now). I would argue that the worldwide value of Bitcoin would increase, as a lot of other currencies are tied into the value of the dollar.

By making Bitcoin newsworthy. Next series is in March, and they write and animate the episodes in seven days. So if Bitcoin has made enough noise by then, you might see an episode. 
EDIT: Apparently, they've changed the format. There's 3 more episodes this year, then no more until autumn 2014. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:44:23
Well that's obvious, but my point was the sheer volume. This will undoubtedly cause a significant price drop. This had been, by far, the biggest use of the currency so far.

Ok, so what is the rate of unexpected death? Because anyone who knows they will soon die is likely to have a backup plan in place (a sealed will with private keys perhaps?). 
So what percentage of the population dies without warning every year? I'm guessing less than 0.1% (I think this is a very generous estimate). So 21,000 might be lost in the first year, leaving 20,979,000 remaining. It's a lot of wealth to disappear, but it won't make a huge impact, and it would take decades for a noticeable drop (48 years to drop below 20 million BTC).

Only if you buy BTC just before your purchase (which I'm sure people wouldn't do). Instead I just hold a couple of BTC, so that I can make purchases. 


As opposed to what? By this definition, almost all purchases are 'fun stuff'. What else do you buy online? 
And by dismissive, I mean comments like " bitcoin is going to zero" (made in another comment tree).

Just because YOU can't use bitcoins for anything useful doesn't mean that applies to everyone. 
I've been using them to buy things abroad, saving myself ridiculous fees chargeable by other companies (ahem, Paypal). It's a much easier way of paying. I used it for the last couple of Humble Bundles too.

Generally, yes. The one exception I'd add to that are those that invested everything into mining, and effectively lost a lot of BTC. 
I agree that I don't regret any purchases. I was actually adding up all of my purchases, and seeing what they are worth after the $1000 pass. It's quite funny in some cases, but I don't regret any. Purchasing can only positively effect the long time value anyways.

Same with currency exchange rates. 
Slippage is as irrelevant as the exchange rate between USD/GBP. Exchange rates are variable anyway.

True, there are fees in getting bitcoins, but there are also fees in changing from one currency to another (even in physical money). 
EDIT: I feel I'm being a bit negative towards, you do have some good points, but I think you're dismissing BTC a bit heavily. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 09:44:53
I'm not sure about the US notes. But the UK notes can be checked in UV light. Might be worth picking up a cheap portable UV light for UK selling. 
Pound coins are also pretty easy to check. easiest check - The coin should have the same orientation on both sides. A lot of fakes haven't been lined up properly. On top of that, the design on the reverse has a unique edging design as well. These can be looked up online, and are often wrong on fake coins.

That happened to me a few times this week (while trying to buy the Humble Bundle). First one never transmitted, and when I reset the Blockchain it disappeared. Second time it came up with "This transaction has not yet been transmitted" again, and stayed that way for about a day, but the payment was received within about 10 minutes.
I'm thinking about changing wallets if I can find a better one.

New BTC entering the market is a fixed amount. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 12:32:35


Do you know how much a business pays to accept your credit card? For smaller retailers it's about 1-2% (I have no idea how much it would be for larger retailers, and I'm sure they wouldn't want me to know anyway). These fees are just built into the prices charged to you. Just because you're seeing them now with Bitcoin, that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. The charges for transactions on Bitcoin (Btc to Btc) are minuscule compared to 'real' money.  
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:15:20
It's not a versatile currency yet, that's true. And most businesses would indeed convert to USD immediately. But that isn't really an issue. They would likely do the same if accepting a foreign currency (it does happen, some UK stores accept Euros). 
There is a website somewhere for paying bills in the UK/Europe with bitcoins. I can't remember where I saw it though. 
This is still an infant currency. After it has stabalised, it will become more widely accepted. And more media coverage is helping with this. 
It is true that my BTC have lost value in the last 3 weeks, but the price had to rise for it to fall. People would be foolish to invest more than they can afford to lose, that I think we can both agree on.
