HODLing does nothing to stabilize price...

What about unit of account?
One of the few reasonable arguments for capitalism is that workers can borrow to buy the means of production.  What sane person would borrow in Bitcoin?

Coins not on the market do not participate in the price.

Too heavy.

Passing around slips of paper is hardmode for Bitcoin mining.

You would have the same upgrade path for post-quantum signatures.  You wouldn't be able to merge PQ sigs into the aggregated (ECC) signature, but you could have a separate PQ aggregated signature.

That meme estimates security of 256-bit symmetric keys.  Bitcoin signatures use 256-bit asymmetric keys with security equivalent to 128-bit symmetric keys.  Bitcoin addresses are 160-bit hashes with security equivalent to 80-bit symmetric keys.
The Bitcoin hashrate is currently about 2^75 hashes per 10 minutes.  Based on that, roughly speaking, it costs about 550 BTC to compute an address collision to spend from the attacked address.
The above is without quantum computing.  The quantum Grover's algorithm is expected to achieve a cubic speed up for hash collisions, so Bitcoin addresses would have about 53-bit security.

Currency is an interesting application of block chain tech, but Bitcoin lacks price stability.

All good points, but generalized statements on the security of Bitcoin addresses should include possible attacks where the *sender* generates the recipient's address (like for non-interactive one-time addresses and payment channels).
I explicitly stated the 80-bit security level was for a collision attack vector.  I computed the 550 BTC cost to show that even that security level was plenty for pretty much everyone.  Any address at risk could be spent to a recipient generated address and have the 160-bit preimage resistance you mentioned.
I'm not too worried about quantum computing.  The tech needed to build one is decades off.  Even if you had one now, they are pretty slow.  Last I read, state of the art QC could do ~~hundreds~~ thousands of operations per second.  So, you would either need very many QCs, or need to run it for a very long time to break 53-bit security.  That would likely cost much more than 550 BTC.
I had no intention to mislead.  Thanks for the opportunity to clarify.  I mostly wanted to convey that both the value of and cost to attack the crypto in digital currencies is/should be easy to quantify, rather than portraying it as a mystical, impenetrable force field protecting a vault.

Thank you for the peer review!  You're right, that's totally broken.  No idea why I failed to consider a *random* S and working back.  I had asked for reviews (from EdDSA author, crypto.stackexchange, reddit, friends), but got no real response.  Crypto is hard in isolation.
I was overambitiously omitting R from the hash to allow adhoc multisig, which I don't believe is discussed in the paper.  You can hash R, and the designs discussed in the rest of the paper should be fine.
Again, thank you for the best feedback I've had yet.

Actually, aggregated signatures are possible with Schnorr, and you don't need to suffer the performance hit of BLS signatures.  I proposed such a method [in this paper]( using ed25519.
Edit:  I misread.  The article says aggregated signatures are possible with Schnorr signatures.  The *bonus features* are claimed impossible, but again, I would disagree.
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:00:41
Suppose, you verify a signature (R, S) by checking S*B = PK + H(R)*H(M)*R.  Do you see any weakness in this scheme?
Are you familiar with a secure signature verification equation similar to this which does not include both PK and R in the hash with M?
Edit:  It occurs to me now that there is no benefit to using H(R)*H(M)*R instead of H(R,M)*R.
BLS signatures are looking more and more appealing.

No.  I'm saying that fork validity is a subjective assessment, and consensus rules are political.  Who is allowed the authority to say which fork is Bitcoin?  Everyone and no one.
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:22:24
Bitcoin is configured to fork every 10 minutes.  This is overlooked, because each chain fork rarely leads to a community fork.
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:36:20
...but which Bitcoin is the *right* one?
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:51:43
I would like to see a coin with a monetary policy determined by continuous weighted voting, native support for compensating network nodes, and offline proof of work.
I have designed such a coin a few years ago, but there was little interest.
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:51:45
I'm sorry you see that as disingenuous.  I see the point as being central to understanding the political nature of chain consensus.
Honestly, I think Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core are equally terrible.
