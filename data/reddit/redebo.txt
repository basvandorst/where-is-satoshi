So I'm new to crypto, and with $5k invested a small player, but the thing that keeps sticking in my head is the seemingly exclusive use of ASIC's to mine Bitcoin.  Wasn't the original idea to have a decentralized network of computers verifying the transactions of Bitcoin?  If the current algorithm to mine only allows ASIC based operations to be profitable, this is a MAJOR issue.  It will eventually lead to another 'centralized' system where a few actors control the entire currency by voting with their hash rate.  If I could mine bitcoin, I'd spend some money building rigs to do so, but if there's no way for me to even break even in the process, how long would the community expect me to lose money just to keep the idea of bitcoin alive?
In Satoshi's paper, he specifically calls out that attacks on the network are unlikely because you'd have to have sustained cooperation of more than 50% of the hashing power of the network.
Isn't that EXACTLY what is happening here?  The ASIC's are centralizing the processing power (like the fiat banking system having a few large players) so now it only takes convincing a few of them to flip sides to completely disrupt the entire premise of the currency (taking over 50% hash rate)?  Am I the only one who sees parallels as to what the fed does when they step in and modify interest rates thereby 'convincing' the major actors in the banking sector to change policies?
Can the Bitcoin algorithm be changed to allow multiple difficulty levels or so that it doesn't work on ASIC based systems?  Shouldn't we be looking to solutions like this to harden the system?

P90DL is pretty good too. ;)

You've got 3, maybe 4 actual usage areas here.
Gold as "value" is highly arbitrary (as is FIAT money AND all forms of cryptocurrency).
To test for yourself:  Imagine being stranded on an island.  Would you rather have a lake of fresh water, a mountain of gold, a wallet full of bitcoin, or a warehouse full of US dollar bills?
That's the real point to make behind ANYTHING we decide to say "has value" insomuch that it only has value in specific applications, if all other needs are met.  From that standpoint, it's hard to argue that something that only exists in the physical world is superior to something that can be transferred and transported at the speed of light.

Fair statement.
Could use this argument to stop all of this forking discussion until BTC becomes a standard form of currency.

I'm a simple man.  I see Marshall, I upvote him.
