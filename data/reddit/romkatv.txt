Thanks! This is very helpful.

I think channels that can be closed with a single settlement transaction must necessarily have limited lifetime. Unlimited-lifetime channels require a trigger, an update and a settlement transaction to close them. There seems to be a fundamental reason why trigger has to be a separate transaction from settlement but perhaps there is a clever way to eliminate the update transaction, reducing the number of required transactions from three to two?

Do I understand it correctly that eltoo, unlike LN, can work even in the presence of malleable transactions? If all off-chain transactions are floating, malleability isn't a problem, right?

Using `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` as a general purpose malleability fix can be tricky. I'm wondering whether it's enough specifically for eltoo.
Suppose I'm using a good implementation of eltoo on Bitcoin prior to SegWit. Can the other party steal my money by exploiting transaction malleability? I think the answer is No. The first transaction (2-of-2 multisig) needs to be confirmed before off-chain payments start, and after that every transaction is floating and thus independent of prior transactions' hashes.
If this analysis is correct, that would be very cool from the theoretical perspective as it would mean that eltoo does await with one of the assumptions made by LN. I'm likely wrong, though, for I'm an amateur.

Do I understand it correctly that closing an eltoo channel requires three on-chain transactions (trigger, update and settlement) while LN-Penalty requires only one?

Would it work with a reverse SSH tunnel instead of VPN? It's easier to set up.
1. Make sure you are able to SSH from your local host (the one running lnd) to your VPS without password.
2. Open port 9735 on your VPS.
3. Run the following command on your local host (on boot):
  ssh -f -N -T -R9735:localhost:9735 157.230.95.74
(157.230.95.74 is the IP of the VPS.)
I haven't tried it though.

It would be nice if it worked. I think it *can* work if the authors of lnd consider it a valid use case.
In general, if your server receives an incoming TCP connection from ip:port, it doesn't mean you can establish an outgoing connection to it. You almost never can reach the exact same ip:port, although it may be possible to reach some other port on the same host. I admit that I don't know how lnd works, so I'm just speculating on what it might be expected to do.
If anyone has tried this setup, or knows the lnd code well enough, could you comment on whether it works?


Would this make a practical difference? I image the latency added by SSH is minuscule compared to network latency.

Unless the population of Australia goes down. Surely it would be possible for every Aussie to own 1 BTC if there were just a dozen of them.
