Hey! Yeah I've looked into them. My only issue is that I believe Local Trader is only for mycelium wallets =/ 
I feel like people should be able to store their coins in whatever way they see fit!
I don't want to build a wallet, or an escrow service, or an exchange. I want to empower people to be their own exchanges and I think this is possible by using data intelligently to make it easier for bitcoiners to find other people to transact with.
Have you used Mycelium Local Trader before?

Thanks for the response! Rebit.ph is definitely interesting, I remember coming across an article on coindesk about them a little while back.
I wonder if they're able to provide their service to US citizens because they're under Philippine jurisdiction. Converting bitcoin to fiat and delivering it to a beneficiary on behalf of the sender sounds a lot like money transmission. Or at least currency exchange. 
Anyways, ZipZap (give them cash and they give you coins) + rebit.ph(send them coins and they'll pay out cash) is exactly what I'm talking about. It would be great if these two mechanisms lived under one roof. The bitcoin transmission could then be streamlined and obfuscated and the whole thing would be more approachable to those actually looking to remit in cash.

Wow, thanks for replying here jerguismi! As you can probably tell I'm a big fan of what you've built with LB. Honestly, I'm most interested in solving the cash remittance problem (think ZipZap for cash in + a network of rebit.ph type companies for cash out) and I decided that an OTC marketplace would be a good way to test some assumptions. I would love to speak with you at greater length about how things are going at your company if you don't mind! 
I agree that LB does not "own" every transaction i.e. it is possible to use LB to complete a transaction without paying any fees to the service. It's my understanding that you are only required to use a LB wallet if you want to use the escrow service.

Working on it =]

I had not heard of this, but I will definitely check it out. Thanks!

Hey jesset77, can you go into more detail about how their escrow service aids in transactions in locations that do not have internet access? Thanks!

Ah, okay this makes total sense. The coins do not have to be stored in the mycelium wallet at the time of the listing, only at the time of trade confirmation. Then they are transferred between mycelium wallets.
Thanks for clearing that up for me!

Thanks lorddamax, this is really great insight. 
So, for you, LB is more of an arena for you to simply say "I'm here" (like a convention that lets you rent a booth and talk to passers by)  vs. an order filling mechanism (like a real estate brokerage that is actively trying to find deals for you)? Am I getting closer?

Thanks for your response! My takeaway: Finding a matching order isn't broken, so this proposed differentiation isn't different enough to provide any substantial new value. 
I suppose finding a matching order is doable, I'm just pondering how one might improve the process =]

Great point. The individual transaction design doesn't really work well for users that are looking to buy/sell as a service. That would be a huge pain in the ass having to submit a new order every time someone accepted your current one.
Perhaps a "daily trading balance" feature would work better for traders that want to do what you're doing and this is also a way that ATMs could list on the site. For example, at the beginning of the day you tell the application "I'm willing to sell up to 5 BTC today " or "I'm willing to buy up to $1000 in BTC" and the program would simply subtract from that total as you accepted matches throughout the day.
Lastly, the alert system wouldn't just let you know that someone had BTC for sale, rather, it would be a match with another user containing a specific amount, timeframe, markup, etc. based on your user settings/preferences.
What do you think? would this make buying/selling as a service easier for you?

I'm thinking that the matching algo used would query the database of open offers and pop the "best" match. You're right, attempting to match orders exactly would most likely result in a lot of people missing out on matches that they would have happily taken. Thanks for your opinion!
