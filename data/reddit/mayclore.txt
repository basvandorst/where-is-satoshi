Yes, it notifies for sending and receiving, and I can't help you with Ethereum 'cause I don't use it.

Them: BITCOIN PRICE CRASHING, PANIC, SELL, FAILURE, CIVIL WAR, DOOM, APOCALYPSE
Me: So you're telling me bitcoin is on sale at the moment and I should cram my paper wallet full of it?
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:18:32
Sorry, but it's the truth.

Oh, it's that time of the day where *someone* shoves 35,000 transactions onto the blockchain for *some reason*.
Or, it's just the daily rush. I managed to get one through, and the Tx numbers are coming down, so just be patient.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:08:37
When in doubt, HODL.

Does Bitcoin... in a bubble.
That's not how you words, writer, try again.

Register an email at  and you can subscribe to addresses to get notices about transactions. It's what I use.

If I wanted a President of Bitcoin, I wouldn't *be* in Bitcoin. I've got plenty of centralized currencies to choose from for that insanity.
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:09:23
Yeah, uh, it'd have to lose about $2,500 more before I feel sorry and/or foolish.

"unreliable transactions"
I think I've had one transaction fail? Ever? Like, seriously, ever.
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:18:33
Feels like this is the 85th time the bubble has burst.

HOLY HELL, 70,000 TXS?
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:27:50
Why? Come on, Cassandra, don't hold out on us.
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:21:10
I'm sorry, what, exactly, do you "thihk" will be happening in three days?
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:16:48
I will now forever picture the blockchain as an endless freight train traveling above a volcano waiting to punish stupid rolling stock manufacturers.
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:57:57
Yes, it's happening everywhere, because there are suddenly 75,000 TXs on the network. For reasons.

For Bitcoin to be a million each, something would have gone exceptionally FUBAR in dolla-dolla land and its price fluctuations would likely be the least of my worries.

Bitcoin is the tide upon which all altcoin boats rise.

The one where you get a house at the top, apparently.

Pretty soon, we'll have to replace the background with an image of the Milky Way.
