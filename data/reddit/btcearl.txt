It was easier just to let people think at the time I made it big through stock trading since I was known for dabbling in that. Bitcoin was just too hard to explain and raised too many eyebrows. These days I'm a bit more open about being invested in it but people think I got into it only just recently.

Shoot me down if you must but **Dogecoin** is where I see a lot of potential.
My rationale is this - of all the alt-coin communities theirs is the only one I see actively engaging the general public and using their collective effort to do some real good in this world. When crypto goes mainstream I could easily see Dogecoin becoming the feel-good currency used by popular artists and media as opposed to the drier and transaction focused Bitcoin.
tl;dr Dogecoin - because of the human factor which is critical to adoption of any cryptocoin.

Sorry - missed answering the splurging part.
I have a young family so we ended up paying off the mortgage, buying a couple of new cars and doing some travel. We have also given away a fair bit to family and friends who we have just let think we had a big win on the stock market, it was easier back then to do that then try to explain Bitcoin to them. Not to mention the negative connotations associated with it in the mainstream at the time.
I haven't quit my day job, but knowing you have financial freedom right there does change you whole outlook on life.

No. I'm here, take it or leave it. Call me paranoid but for the same reason I'm using a throwaway and TOR to be here I have no particular desire to be connected directly with a specific set of transaction chains. Bitcoin is *pseudonymous* not *anonymous*
And no, I'm not Satoshi either.

I've dropped a few BTC here and there as dontations but when it comes to projects I prefer to invest directly as a stakeholder. I did previously donate to several podcasters but I have to admit to becoming more cynical and stingy since my Gox experience.
For *actual* charities that have a real world, real life impact like Sean's Outpost though - I've regularly supported their efforts and would strongly urge anybody in a similar position to myself to do the same.

Nothing has really changed. There are things you can only pay for using fiat but I always look for opportunites, especially when travelling, to use Bitcoins when I can. That said, I've already cashed out more than enough BTC to the bank for my family and lifestyle needs so what I have left in BTC I am spreading out into other coins and crypto technology just to see where it goes.
@_date: 2014-11-08 22:25:08
Yes, I do. I've already cashed out a good chunk to fiat, what I have left in crypto is there because I believe it does have a future. Unlike a lot of Bitcoin supporters I feel the future involves multiple cryptocurrencies and not just Bitcoin in and of itself.
I'd like to think I've matured in my view of crypto in the past 18 months, particularly from listening to people like Andreas Antonopolous who have really opened my eyes to where this technology is headed, it's much less a game to me now than it used to be.

At my peak (2012) I had 82.5K BTC. Spend/Traded/Donated a pile of them down to 33K before taking it seriously and then lost over 20K on GOX. Currently have remaining 12K distributed between several exchanges, cold wallets and physical (Casascius) coin investments.
Take-away lesson here - don't put most of your eggs into one basket!

Hindsight is 20/20 and in retrospect I should have. But at the same time the alleged use of the "Willy" bot to drive up the price of BTC at the time *did* enable me to sell a good chunk of coins in the lead up to the crash for a tidy sum. Suddenly becoming flush with that much fiat at the time did distract me with other things but I have nobody to blame but myself for what I lost on Gox and should have paid closer attention. I did think about selling my "Goxcoins" at the time but as I still had other BTC investments and money in the bank I decided to wait. I do feel sorry for those people who were 100% invested in Gox, I just count myself lucky in all of this it could have been a lot worse.

Like most people at that time it was just a hobby thing. I don't think anybody playing around with the technology back there really had an idea of where it was headed, at least at the speed at which it happend and the value shooting up.
I did mine a little bit but most of my BTC was accumulated via trading, a little from faucets (negligible as they were drying up around then) and just general stuffing around with other people.
I just thought the technology was really neat.

A colleague of mine had recently got into it and wouldn't shut up about it! We had plenty of spare time and access to a bunch of idle desktop machines in our line of work so we stuffed around with it between jobs to kill time more than anything else. We used to play with Seti and then it kind of flowed on from there as a good way to use the idle time on a bunch of computers. Early on I played with just the coins we had minted but as the price started to creep my own interest in share markets kicked in and I decided to throw a little of my own money at buying some directly.

Yeah, it does happen but I always paint it as a "lucky break" and not due to any ongoing skill or talent on my part. I've had some spectacular fails in the past that I'm known for so I just let people think good karma finally caught up with me.

I have roughly 6 K spread around several exchanges which I actively trade into other cryptocoins, Dogecoin being a favourite of mine. I've been experimenting with arbritage bots in my spare time trying to work out an ideal strategy. I also dropped a good chunk of BTC onto the recent Ethereum offering as I really feel that has a lot of potential in the next 5 - 10 years. Or sooner, if our experience with Bitcoin is any example.

If you are talking about the metz address I wasn't around *that* early or involved with that. I came on board during mid-2011 before all the early hype took hold.

Sure, if you can work out my private keys!
