Honestly if satoshi dumped all his coins in a single exchange I bet you we would have another Mt.Gox situation in a heartbeat. If bitcoin catches on, exhange operators will be the new bankers.

If I had the ability, I absolutely would.

It's not like tipping is impossible with credit cards though, its just that nobody has ever bothered to implement it.

And then 50 of those 50 people die without telling anybody their private keys (because why the fuck would they) and now the world is just 35% poorer.
repeat until 90% of all bitcoins belong to wallets whose keys are known only to dead people.
@_date: 2014-12-13 20:26:25


Yeah sure

When its a pitiful amount of money, and when it isn't even for everybody who is reading it, then yes.
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:02:23
Yes, because nobody has ever had their bitcoins stolen from them, right?
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:46:15
dude, you really didn't *need* to watch it. the fact that you're on here means you are already knowledgable about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-27 03:54:17
looks more like a mrs.bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:21:14
Agreed, plus most people care about it for the football, not the bitcoin.

Are you karmanaut?
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:06:21
I'm pretty fucking upset about it.
My cardiac knights didn't pull through.

@_date: 2014-12-24 13:34:54
You say it like that's a bad thing. It's the best part!
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:15:25
Down by the vajayjay.
@_date: 2014-10-27 23:58:47
They really are, you know, down there.
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:01:03
Do you know what percentage of tips actually lead to people investing in Bitcoin? I would like to know if tipping actually helps the Bitcoin culture, or if they are just immediately sold for dirty fiat.
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:52:15


How is bitcoin more convenient or efficient than handing somebody a &lt;few&gt;dollars?
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:54:36


[The fed controls interest rates](

excuse me, but there are clearly 3 distinct red rectangles
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:14:46


And this is inherently bad? People specialize (as they should). Some people become really familiar with how the human body works or become really good at writing stories, or cooking delicous meals etc. And Bitcoin is irrelevant to all of these things. People should not have to read an 8 page highly-technical paper just to have a conversation.
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:41:27


?? mind explaining to this humble redditor your strange acronyms?
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:25:04
Honestly, the problem hasn't been getting people aware of Bitcoin's existence for awhile, it's been getting them to buy into it.
@_date: 2014-08-15 01:16:10
If bitcoin is to ever be a viable currency it fucking *must* be a good store of value. How the fuck do you people not understand this.
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:46:49
Can confirm
source: that picture.
@_date: 2014-12-23 04:42:36
As opposed to bitcoin where 51% means unlimited free money?
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:27:06
Its not wrong. The full name is the Bitcoin st. petersburg bowl, and this is the official website: 
 
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:19:12
Because if bitcoin is to ever be a viable store of value, it must actually, you know *store its value*
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:05:14


@_date: 2014-12-14 01:12:23
**BECAUSE BITCOIN IS A CURRENCY DAMNIT**. bitcoin is a currency, not a fucking investment. you buy a currency for the things you can buy *with* that currency, not to make money off of changing prices in that currency. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:37:12
Oh man, you just said a lot of the things I have been wanting to say for awhile, but have been too lazy 
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:17:31
correct, but if the US says a big fat no you can expext a big fat drop in exchange values.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:08:04
Of course fiat is slightly volatile, but inflation is like, what, 5% per year? That's certainly less than bit coin.
