Everyone has an agenda. Listen to both sides and make up your own mind.
Even Mineracc left out details when replying to you. It's true that a transaction submitted to the Bitcoin network cannot be undone. But that's not what the video is pointing out. Within a lightning transaction, you're not making real bitcoin transactions, you're just updating amounts owed when the tx does clear. Effectively it works like IOUs. The video is more correct than Mineracc is.

It goes both ways. You can't disagree with a liberal without being called a racist. I think that is actually more true than the other way around.
@_date: 2019-07-12 21:30:50
You'd be surprised. If you voice disagreement, you're just labeled an "other" who believes all that is bad. "Oh, you believe X? You must believe Y too. Fuck you!" Is usually how it goes. There's no discourse.

Bitcoin will be an inflationary currency for the next 120 years. It seems as if it is deflationary because demand is exceeding supply, but that's part of the experiment. Yes, it is anti-inflation. So it is anti "interest rates" in the federal reserve sense, because that's one of the methods it uses (via QA, etc) to print new money. But It has no opinion on interest rates between individual parties in the economy.

TBH i don't understand
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:02:33
Nobody has to take an opposing bet. Margin is based on lending. This person borrowed bitcoin and sold it, hoping the price would go down so that they could buy it back at a cheaper price. That way they could buy back what they owe to their lender, and have extra money left over for themselves (profit).
But the price went up instead of down. The person who borrowed was forced to sell all their bitcoin when the price got high enough that, given their collateral, if the price went any higher, they would not be able to buy enough bitcoin to pay back their loan. So they effectively lost the collateral they put up for the loan.
So taking a short position required a lender and collateral, but no opposing bet.
A followup question might be: What's in it for the lender? The answer is that the lender is able to charge interest while the loan is out.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:57:54
I explained margin from how I've seen it implemented on other exchanges. How does Bitmex give you "leverage" without giving you a loan?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:55:38
Nobody specific. My understanding is that when the margin position is called, they're forced to place a market order, purchasing bitcoin from whoever has open orders on the books. $203k loss for this person does not mean a gain for anyone else, unless you consider the small small upward price movement as the result of this large purchase to be a gain for everyone who holds bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:56:19
Cool maybe you can explain how I'm wrong.

Bitcoin's primary philosophy is to be your own bank, not to... not margin trade on exchanges.

How?  In traditional money, they can see every transaction you're making - tied to your name.  In bitcoin, they can see every transaction you're making - but they have to figure out how to tie it to your name first.  And at any time, you can launder pretty easily using any of a variety of tools, which is much more difficult in the traditional world.
Fiat has cash, which is less traceable, but also way less versatile.  That's really the only better part, and it doesn't count for much.

To me that just sounds like a case for bitcoin, not against it.

The benefits of both cash + electronic transfer.  This exact use case is why Silk Road took off.
@_date: 2014-05-22 22:48:58
Like I said, the exception is cash.  But that doesn't count for much.  The overlap between the things that you would want to do, and not be known about, and the things you can pay for with cash, is kind of small.  The vast majority of payments for people using bitcion are already electronic anyway - not only that, but bitcoin being global and instant opens entire markets of purchases that would not be possible with either cash or banks.

Some of these aren't multisig-specific.
Also Coinbase does let you set a daily spending limit here, after which 2fa will be required:

Some of these requests don't make sense. You cannot have a company that:
1) Lets you buy bitcoin with a traditional bank/CC, and
2) Lets you be anonymous
It is not possible. Hooking up a payment method undoes your anonymity. Not only that, but providing those services often requires them by law to "Know Your Customer."
So, do what you want. It may even make sense security-wise. But there are no ethical implications from providing these services and abiding by current law, so please don't pretend to be taking a moral highground.
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:53:27
Sidechains are great, I wasn't debating that. The problem is bitcoin's development being co-opted by a for-profit company. It'd be like if HTML5 were designed by 70% Microsoft, instead of a working group composed of various companies of equal parts, or a non-profit. Obviously everything would go MSs way, and it would be bad for everybody. This situation is the exact same thing.
So here you have side chains being developed, which is great in theory, but if Blockstream finds it easier to take shortcuts by adding code that doesn't actually fit bitcoin's goals, only their company's - or if they start blocking competition (which is *already* happening by lukejr and you guys haven't even been funded for 6 months yet) - then suddenly you get a blockchain that meets specific needs instead of general ones, and serves private interests instead of public interests, and it's a complete disaster. And yeah maybe lukejr doesn't work for Blockstream but he may as well seeing as he contributed to your private company's research, and other devs on your team hold similar roles in the development of bitcoin.
This is the kind of thing the Blockstream guys would have vehemently opposed on moral and practical levels two years ago, but with power in their hands and money in their eyes, surprise - their minds have changed.
It's awful.

Exactly. It's not like he's pointing out a new issue.  This is just... a random criticism?
Whether or not someone wants to share that info is up to each individual given their personal tradeoffs. Many are willing to take the small risk of sharing their info for the benefits of actually being able to buy BTC.
Yeah sure, a risk for BTC holders or whatever. But if not sharing their info prevents them from even acquiring BTC in the first place then isn't the argument moot?
Thanks for your opinion I guess?

The Google Ventures point you're stuck on isn't very meaningful. Sure, they're legit, but you compare them to Coinbase who is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, which is basically in the top 5 VC firms and GV doesn't come close. Xapo is backed by Benchmark, Circle is backed by Accel, etc. These are all legit names and tbh these other ones have more experience than GV.
The only point that can be derived from this is that you do not actually know a lot about the venture capital environment and you are easily lured by the Google brand, despite the fact that GV is basically completely separate from the rest of the company.

To be fully truthful, the error that happened to blockchain recently could also happen in a bad release of a desktop client. You're actually telling people false information. I can tell that you don't mean to, but it's just as dangerous. The issue with blockchain was not due to their nature as a service hosted on the web - it was due to bad key generation, which can happen in any release of any bitcoin software. You're also failing to mention Coinbase's multisig option, which gives the private keys to the user instead of Coinbase.

You're really trying hard to intentionally not see the message here.
I never said that women *should* be in bitcoin.  Generalizing that any class of people should do anything is pretty clearly not what I'm saying.
But if we do want women to be involved in bitcoin, we have to stop ridiculing people when they point out that their involvement mostly as objects of desire is bad for our community. You're part of this problem.
These women aren't "involved in bitcoin." If you think they are - you're deluded. Being "involved" in a community doesn't mean stand around and be paid to promote it without knowing anything about it, to act as eye candy. It means being an active part of the community and taking part in the discussions around the technology. If you promote the former, it dissuades women from the latter. You are promoting the former.
Also your definition is just really weird and middlescool-esque. The way you're using the phrase "white knight" is like calling someone a "fag" in Halo - meaningless. Very educated of you. In the way it's meant to be used as an insult, "white knight" doesn't mean someone who points out sexism, it means a guy who treats a specific woman as a victim and steps in on her behalf whether she needs it or not, in an attempt to be her valiant protector, undermining her ability to self-assert. That doesn't apply here because there is no specific instance. What is anyone winning by arguing my side? Only collaboration with an entire half of our race by helping them to feel more included. Not some specific person I hope to have sex with. Who is it - where are they? They aren't. The insult you are trying to make just doesn't work or make sense.
I assume you know this, but something is ticking you off about not being able to be mysoginistic and have everyone agree with you, so you're purposely using it in a wrong way that doesn't apply here, to induce e-rage in a stranger on the internet. Usually, when you get to that point in your life, it's because you're really just mad yourself.  I can see you there sitting, brewing. Ugh.
You can keep your blinders on if you want, but it's not going to help you or make you a happier person. I feel sorry for you, and you need to grow up.

Why do you think this is hinting at Coinbase? It's kind of baseless speculation.

There are no options for decentralized exchange into the traditional financial system. They are mutually exclusive because of the credentials required.

You're being facetious by continually changing the argument. No one is saying a woman shouldn't take any job she well pleases. She can and should. There is a clear difference between that, and being a community mostly of men that only recognizes women when they're present as sexual objects. You do that when you berate other people as "white knight" for pointing it out. You support sexism.

From the video I saw, it looks like you can literally sign up, attach a credit card, and make a purchase directly with that credit card, immediately. Nobody's gotten an invite yet so I can't confirm for 100%.
So that is pretty awesome, but I can't fathom how they would be able to continue to provide that at general availability, outside of a highly restricted beta.  There's a reason PayPal doesn't let you add to your balance by charging a credit card.

20 mb blocks doesn't mean they'll all be *full*. To start, they'll be around the same size now and only increase in size as adoption does. By the time we start reaching that limit, consumer hard drives will have expanded greatly in storage capacity, as has been happening for the past 20 years.
@_date: 2015-05-10 01:34:30
Huh? Nobody claimed that Coinbase supporting larger block sizes was itself a justification for larger block sizes. If you want the justifications, read all the other posts. They were simply pointing out that the thesis put forward by this post is wrong.

Maybe you do not live in the US, or you are talking about transfers internal to the same bank. In the US, where Coinbase is based, the ACH system does in fact take several business days to settle. This archaic infrastructure is what bitcoin is helping to replace.
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:43:46
No, they only charge your credit card if your bank transaction fails. In most cases the card is not charged. Even when it is, it's four business days later, not at the time of transaction. Coinbase does issue credit.

The purpose of bitcoin isn't to force everyone out of centralized systems, it's to give them the ability to opt out if they want to.
Guess what? There's literally no other way to do an exchange that lets you maintain a dollar balance right now.
If you want to not participate in that and prefer to hold your money yourself outside of a system, by all means, *do it*. That's great. But trying to say everyone should use their money the same way is just as bad as fiat proponents.

I don't actually believe that. There have been posts showing big flows of countering bids on those exchanges that keep the price flat without doing anything but pumping the volume. I also just intuitively feel that bitcoin is not actually being viewed with the same enthusiasm/viral use in Asia as it is in the west, more of a business opportunity where people who can mine for cheap cash out. I could be wrong. I sure don't have proof of any of it either way, but I kind of doubt China is actually doing more volume than bitstamp + bitfinex.

$1k is the instant limit. i.e. that's how much you can get on credit immediately if you enter your ID. They give you the coins, then initiate the bank transfer, and they don't get your money til days later. So you've received it on credit.
If you choose to not enter your ID, you still get a $3k daily limit, but you receive the coins after 4 business days.

If it doesn't let you instant-exchange to dollars, then it's never going to be widely used.
In the best case, most people using this would be sending the bitcoin they receive to Coinbase to sell it to dollars anyway. At that point you may be using their merchant tools.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:56:53
Coinbase does in fact give you credit if you do instant buy. You need to enter your personal info to get to level 2, which provides instant buy. You do not need to enter your personal info before that and without that information they cannot run a credit check.
Your "as I remember" is also wrong, because you can currently (and have always been able to) create an account without entering your personal info, other than legal name which is the only thing required when signing up. ID info is an option for higher limits that you willingly choose to do.
There are in fact services that do credit checks without giving credit. For example, you will often need to have a credit check run when applying for an apartment, even though no credit is being given. Two out of three apartment applications for me in the past 5 years have required one.
Further, banking information in itself is not any kind of indication of who you are. Bank account numbers are easy to steal and are entered on sites like Coinbase/Circle all the time. I'm not sure you understand, but they actually mean *nothing* about you.
You are wrong on all counts, and yeah, if someone's going to issue me credit or let me buy $50k worth of a digital currency that is immediately liquid and non-reversible, I think it's pretty reasonable to run a simple credit check first (as an understatement).
This "my soul will be stolen if I do a credit check" is FUD. "Anonymity above all else" has become a religion here, and you're one if its ministers. There are services for which it is reasonable - for many, given their personal preferences and risk assessments, buying virtual currency is a perfectly acceptable case.

I just checked, the instant limit is $1k, which is still credit and still significant. Your $50k limit applies to regular buys.

Ripe for the scamming.
Edit: Now that I think about it, what I *suspect* that they mean in the 2nd bullet point, is that you have immediate access to bitcoin *that you send into the account from elsewhere*.  That means, you already own the bitcoin.
Instant purchase via bank or credit card would be extremely risky because they'd be scammed to high heaven. But that's what the text makes it sound like they are providing. I think they aren't. So they're really just being disingenuous.
Being able to deposit bitcoin that you *already own* into a wallet isn't something to tout - it's the expected default of any bitcoin wallet.  That they have to inflate their launch with silly tricks like this puts a little doubt in my mind about whether or not they actually do provide anything significant.
Edit 2: I just watched their demo video at the bottom of their [blog post]( It looks like they do actually allow instant buy with bank account or credit card.  That is kind of awesome, I will be surprised if it lasts.

I generally agree if the status of the app is made very apparent. But samourai has not made its development status very apparent, and is therefore more responsible than the user in this case.

@_date: 2018-06-19 16:17:09
The responsibility is on both. Especially if it's not even clear that it's an alpha. For example, the samourai play store page doesn't even say alpha. It doesn't say it in the app either, even under settings &gt; about. Where was it supposed to have been displayed? If you make it that unclear, you're basically tricking users, and that is definitely on the dev.
I agree with your first paragraph. If a user is clearly warned that they may lose money, the user isn't being smart by using the app.
Looking at samourai specifically, the dev is pretty much fully responsible. The user is not clearly warned at all.

You overestimate the theif's familiarity with bitcoin, and the price of stolen bank account info. Stolen bank account info is sold on the black market in bulk. You don't buy one account for $5, you buy like a thousand accounts for $100. They're cheap because (1) they're easy to get, and (2) a significant amount of them won't work. So there is a trade that happens between the person willing to put in the effort of collecting the numbers, and the person willing to put in the effort to test each one for a big payoff. They're different skill sets and often the seller is content just to sell because his profit stream is smaller but constant, and the buyer is content to buy because of the dollar signs in his eyes and maybe past success. But where they meet on price is actually pretty cheap. It's like lottery tickets.


But that *is* essentially what he said. The sentence had two parts, I was elaborating on this part: "we **also** might do some analysis if we believe people are trying to scam us by moving to a personal wallet and back to make it appear the accounts aren't linked".
From the context it is pretty clear that he's just saying they have to treat their customer's customer's like their own, and that separately, in addition to MSB regulation, they have to protect themselves against fraud.


Not really to me... "As for whether we try to track transactions after they are withdrawn to personal wallets, the answer is generally no."
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:24:35
1. Buy stolen bank account information for, like, $5
2. Buy thousands of dollars of bitcoin on Coinbase using that bank account
3. Move the bitcoin off coinbase to your personal wallet
4. Create a second Coinbase account with your real bank account
5. Move the bitcoin to your 2nd coinbase account and sell it
6. You've just stolen a few thousand dollars from somebody's grandma
Definitely "moving bitcoin between accounts," and definitely fraud. People do not realize that the only reason companies like Coinbase exist is because they can (somewhat) prevent this on a daily basis, because bad actors are attempting it *all the time*. Like literally every minute. 30 people are trying it now on coinbase, circle, whatever, and the company can only survive if they can detect it and prevent it.

No it doesn't, you're still free to use an altcoin if you want. "Decentralization" is about having options and not being forced to use one. Nobody's forcing you to choose bitcoin, they're just making a good argument as to why it should receive focus.
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:30:50
These things are not mutually exclusive. Also, keep in mind:
1) It's not just one Chinese exchange we're talking about here. Taking just the ones in the top 10, the claimed total for bitcoin volume in the last 24 hours is over *650,000 bitcoin*. I mean, I'm definitely a believer and I think and hope bitcoin will succeed in the long run, but there's just no way that number is real.
2) There've been many debunks of these numbers. [Here's just one example]( If you search you can find tons more. On top of that, they most likely count *both sides of the trade* towards the volume when it doesn't make sense to do that.
3) The idea that "no trading fees" gets you instant insane volume is just not believable or a great argument. Coinbase has no fees and they're the easiest USD exchange to get money into. By that line of reasoning their 24 hour volume should be 500,000. It just doesn't work that way.
Chinese exchanges are definitely enlarging their numbers. It's about appearing the most popular to attract new traders.

The answer is because they *are* allowed. Licensing isn't always the only path. They probably reached out to state regulators and said, "we're going to do this, here's our due diligence, we know it's going to take you another year to issue a license, is it okay if we go live now?" and got a positive response.
As for the rest of their issue, they pretty clearly stated that it's outside of their control. You can dislike them if you want, but it's not reasonable by any measure as this decision was forced on them by someone they have to bend to the whims of (their bank).

Well, "correction" implies that the path it was on before the correction was incorrect.  By calling this upward swing a "correction," you're saying bitcoin's previous rate of growth - which was already impressive - was incorrect (undervalued), and that we should naturally all be valuing it much more.  I agree with that view *in the long run*, but when we're breaking new ground with 20% rises day over day, it's hard to imagine that this swing is due to real understanding and adoption, and not just the speculation of newbies trying to ride a wave on a technology they don't fully understand.  The "correct" value of bitcoin lies at the intersection of meaningful speculation and real-world adoption.  I fear that over the past few days a third factor of short-term, non-meaningful speculation has been high, raising the price to greater than what it should be *at this point in time.*
Corrections can be positive.  For example, during the April bubble, it fell from 260 to 60, then went back to 180.  The high was too high, and the pop was a correction.  But it fell too low, and the reverse was a correction as well.
I don't think a lower price/rate of growth at this juncture would be incorrect; I don't think that at this point in time, bitcoin would be undervalued if it were at a lower price, even though it is worth much more in the long term.  Therefore I don't think this rise is a correction.

This isn't saying anything at all because on one hand you are comparing the relative price and on the other hand you are comparing absolute prices.  Coinbase's "sell" price was also $10-$15 over bitstamp prices at the time.
Bitstamp is not the only exchange.  Coinbase has their own internal exchange going on as well.  They're not going to match you up with a bitstamp user and have to pay 0.5% on your behalf when they can match you up with an internal user at no cost, and also provide higher selling prices.
It's a tradeoff.  Coinbase isn't Bitstamp.  If you want Bitstamp prices, trade there.
