So I was playing around with an idea to help solve this issue that would *allow anyone* with a bitcoin project to "crowd-source" or spread the expense across multiple projects to certain people who have the skills.
Here is a **rough** [sketch]( .
I figured since there are so many people with project ideas and there is a disconnect with lining up qualified people with bitcoin skills why not create a way where people commit "x amount" a month to escrow-typish system -  people who have the skills "claim" to help the project -&gt; verified the project owner has you working on it -&gt; siphon small amount of bitcoins every month for the variouis BTC project(s) your working on.  I know the link above is very rough but just though I would start some *dialogue w/ solving the issue*....
albeit there is the "quality of work" issue and various other variables but this is a good starting point or no?

This is coming in time I just wanted to put it out there to begin to see if people would be interested.

Thanks man! I believe the post office is already irrelevant.

Yes, I agree there should be more specifics and will start to add it to the website as we speak!
~~is it .005btc per email~~ -  Yes! it is .005 btc per email opened/read and another .005 btc for a Facebook like or Twitter tweet.
~~what additional actions need to be taken besides receiving.~~ At the moment, as long as your open/read the email you will be paid.
~~what is the max daily payout~~  As it stands if you open/read every "paid" email (this will be identified as such) that is sent you can obtain the max. amount of bitcoins possible a week. 
~~How often is the payout~~ Once a week is payout.
~~how do you plan to avoid abuse~~ I'm assuming when you speak of abuse you mean sending out to many emails? there is a "unsubscribe link" in every email if you find there is abuse you can use it or contact us.
These were all great questions thank you for asking them. I'll update the website  in a few minutes.Thanks!
