This is alarmist bullshit.


Why? The US government bailed out the Savings and Loan industry. It bailed out Wall Street. Is there some reason to believe that the lobbying ability of large banks and corporations will wane?
Prediction: In the next banking crisis:
 1. The companies that are sinking will recieve a generous bailout.
 2. The people who caused the crisis will say 'there was no way we could have predicted this.' This will later be revealed to be a lie.
 3. The industry will fire a handful of people and accept new regulations.
 4. The industry will find ways to get around the regulations. Repeat. 
Why do they claim this? Let's look at the pdf they provide:


first nation to experience this new policy formally referred to as “Resolving Globally Active, Systemically Important,
Financial Institutions”2 (translation – procedure to save big banks in lieu of a government-taxpayer Bail-Out). 
First, it's Cyprus, not Cypress. Second, this document was written jointly by the FDIC and the Bank of England. Astute readers will note that the Bank of England can't actually order Cyprus around. Third, the document referenced does not describe current policy.
Resolving Globally Active, Systematically Important, Financial Institutions, Paragraph 13:






















Note that in context, the report does not say that the US or UK is pursuing or advocating this route. It's pointing out that it would be a more efficient route than the current approach, which basically puts the US gov't on the hook for the whole bill. "Sure, you invested in this company without any idea of what it did or how it made money, but we're going to give you back your money anyhow."
What does this mean? It means that if a corporation has more debt than assets during bankruptcy, it will issue stock to those creditors rather than pay them back. The report makes no mention of FDIC insured banks, because those banks are *already* bailed out.

It's like a counter-intelligence technique, where you give different information to different people, and see what surfaces. The problem with this is 'parallel construction.' This is the idea that you monitor something secretly, and find people who you want to arrest. However, you only act on that information if there's some other plausible way that the information could have surfaced.

i'm going to ignore your last two links, because I can't be bothered to read them. I assume they're generally along the same lines as the first.
So, that first link references the same document, "Resolving Globally Active, Systemically Important, Financial Institutions." (God, they really need a better name for that.) It then misinterprets the entire document. If you *actually read* it, it says that US and UK financial organizations will submit regular documentation to the banking authorities of those countries showing that they can declare bankruptcy without causing a global economic meltdown.
In other words, their response to banks that are 'too big to fail' is to force banks to be small enough that they *can* fail. Pretty reasonable.
The article also talks about deposit confiscation in New Zealand. That's a fair point. If a bank fails in NZ, the deposits are not insured, and you can lose money. However, this isn't a new thing. NZ *temporarily* insured deposits during the global financial crisis, but that was never intended to be permanent.

These are two different meanings of "orphan block." Your Bitcoin client is calling them orphan blocks in the sense of, "blocks where I don't have their parent." blockchain.info uses orphan blocks in the sense of, "blocks which are no longer on the best chain."

@_date: 2015-03-21 18:57:13
We shouldn't care because it's a rounding error compared to the federal budget. We shouldn't care because it's very unlikely that the Bitcoins went for less than market value (given that there were 14 bidders present.) We shouldn't care because the question of, "how will this money be used?" is more important than, "exactly how much money did they make?"

This quote is taken out of context. There was an argument on the bitcoin-development mailing list about whether bitcoin.org should participate in the SOPA/PIPA blackout.
[This guy got his underpants in a knot about it:](


Jeff and Luke-Jr, I don't see how this is /just any other poltical 
issue/.  It strikes at the heart of everything Bitcoin is about.  
Barring Bitcoin-specific legislation, I don't see how any legislation 
could be more relevant to Bitcoin and the community around it.
Think about this for a moment: not only does that presume that there's something that Bitcoin is "about," it presumes that it aligns with his particular political beliefs.
[Luke-Jr responds:](


with. To assume everyone has the same interests is a sure-fire way to prevent 
widescale adoption. If you want Bitcoin to succeed, don't try to impose a 
single purpose/"about" on everyone using it (which a "blackout" would do).

In my opinion, it changes the tone of the quote. (Though, that's a difficult thing to measure over the internet.) 
Quoting the entire thread would be ridiculous, but I think you should have at least quoted the section that I did.


He also says this in the post you linked:


That, in my mind, has a much more clear tone. It also supports your interpretation of the part you originally quoted.
So, I'm no longer sure what he was going for in the original quote. +1 for doing your research.
@_date: 2015-03-01 06:27:13


There's a difference in how directly, and how recently it was involved. It's unreasonable for someone to check the providence of a bill 10 transactions back to check for illegality. It *is* reasonable to expect someone to refuse to exchange currency when the buyer says that it was stolen.


I think it would be more accurate to say that he was trying to sell Bitcoins, and didn't care if he was committing a crime.


The fact that some part of the transaction was legal doesn't make the entire transaction legal.


And holy shit, find a browser that has built-in spellchecking.


...are criminals laundering money using socks? If not, *why is that relevant?*


As long as we're speculating on their motivations, let me present an alternate theory: this guy laundered money for someone else, who got caught. That person turned states evidence, and the police set up a sting based on that.

Okay. That's your right. Personally, I have more interesting things to learn about than the exact price of a federal auction. Are you also paying attention to the federal auctions of [empty plots of land]( That seems just as important.


Do you mean 'our money' in the sense that the US government owns it, and ultimately answer to the people? Do you mean 'our money' in the sense that you were a silk road user? Do you mean 'our money' in the sense that you're a Bitcoin user and therefore are entitled to know?




You're correct in principle. But when a question matters a thousand times less than other questions, then you shouldn't care.

The central point of the first link, that there's no such thing as a legitimate government, seems to only be supported by anecdotal evidence and his own philosophy.

You're conflating the transaction being confirmed, and the transaction being validated.
BIP70 doesn't speed up confirmation.
@_date: 2015-02-27 05:10:10
The Bitcoin client keeps track of signatures it's already seen and validated. Sometimes, those signatures show up in blocks. When a signature that has already been validated shows up in a block, it doesn't need to be re-checked, which is good, because this re-checking is expensive.
All of that existed before this commit.
Actual Change:
Instead of tracking each valid signature individually, the client now tracks the validity of each transaction. This is faster, and uses less memory.

You're right that this would be hugely disruptive. Let me share my prediction of what would happen:
After the miners publish their proposed client, and start mining on it, the core Bitcoin developers would propose an alternate modification to the Bitcoin client. This modification would drop the difficulty by a factor of 20, restoring a 10 minute block time.
The disruption would mainly be caused by the fact that people who don't upgrade to the Miner Client or the Core Client wouldn't receive any blocks at all. (The Miner Client blocks would have a reward that is too big, and the Core client's blocks would have a difficulty that is too small.)
Once the miners started switching back over, the block time would decrease to 30 seconds. After about half a day, difficulty would go back up by a factor of four, and keep climbing until the network is back at equilibrium.
The miners know that that's how it would go, so they don't publish an alternate client in the first place.
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:59:56
Right. This would also allow you to do other things, like offer to exchange the cryptocurrency for printed money at a 1:1 rate, or vice-versa. 
Of course, if you have a central authority that you can trust, why make block generation decentralized?

*That isn't what entrapment is.*
There are two elements of entrapment:
1. The state caused you to commit a crime, and  
2. You wouldn't have committed it otherwise.
This situation meets element one, but *not element two.*
If the police had come in and said, "I'll kill you if you don't exchange this stolen money for Bitcoins," that would be entrapment. What the police actually said was, "I'll give you money if you exchange this stolen money for Bitcoins."
