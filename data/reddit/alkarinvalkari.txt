The last week or so I've been seeing tons of 'normies' talking about buying bitcoin on facebook.
What's your guy's thoughts on this? 
Good? Bad? Both?

wha is futures?

Where can I watch this with english subtitles (the full movie that is)

What happened with segwit?

I remember being pissed I bought at 2600 thinking I shouldve waited for the dip.

Asia is weird, man.

I had the same dilemma at $2000. I bought at an ATH, reality is the best time to buy is always "now".

Pretty sure it has more to do with the economics and the water supply than some fickle democrats.

New to BTC here. What do you mean by the keys? Is that someones wallet address? Their account credentials? Or something else?
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:19:43
maybe they can export their meth?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:19:46
The question is how much would BTC be worth as the reserve currency. 10k, 100k? 1000k?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:15:24
What are some recommendations for an exchange? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:30:49
Almost 2700 now
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:06:33
I didnt buy because I thought I was "late" when BTC was around 600. I guess the best time to buy is always now.

So running a node basically gives you a "vote" on matters, and you occasionally get a free bitcoin?

I bought at around 2650 last night. Guess I gotta hodl.

10k is a bit bullish but then again 6 months ago who would've expected it to hit even 1.5k 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:46:46
So how do you obtain these keys if you bought them via coinbase for example? You just transfer them to a wallet like tezor? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:22:28
Roth ira is a type of 401k, yes.
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:45:07
You'll be kicking yourself when its selling for 100k!
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:42:00
Don't invest what you can't afford to lose! I'm confident it will go above 3k atleast some point this year.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:28:23
Whats the personal advantage of running your own node?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:49:05
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:28:35
That's exactly how I felt when BTC was around $600 and I decided not to buy.
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:55:14
My wildest dreams with BTC is to maybe one day have enough for a downpayment on a house. If you got that, a car, and a brand new bathroom, I think you should be proud of your investments.
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:05:27
Whats your reasoning for this?
