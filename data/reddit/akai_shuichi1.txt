Regulatory authorities all over the world have already shot down the idea of letting Libra be a thing. Facebook itself agreed that it has hit regulatory roadblock and that it could possibly never see the light of the day.

It also has a child drug dealer explaining what Bitcoin is in two sentences. The simplest explanation so far. All the teenagers watching the show now know what Bitcoin is.

True. If passed, there will be a lot of people who will use it, mainly because convenience above all. But the point here is that it would be a major hit for all the companies that invested in the project, if Libra continues to take a hit by governments. It could stuck in legal hurdles for decades and the investments of all the companies would drain out just trying to get out of it all. In the end, there could be no returns at all for all those who invested.
