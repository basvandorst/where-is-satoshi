It's really strange. I have never had issues with CEX. Always read bad things about them but Ive never encountered any of these issues with them 10/10 times. The customer service are very responsive to me, maybe one day late reply sometimes but their ticketing system is really good. They even send email to check if my issues are resolved if I didn't reply them. Hmmm.

Oh CEX apps does need improvement, a little buggy here and there. Sometimes I have problem withdrawing my coins. Then, when I try a few more times like an hour later, it usually will go through. I'm just curious about the negative reviews on their customer service because thus far they have been pretty professional to me, may take some time but they always solve my issues. Also becareful of fake CEX.IO Customer Service links, they just warn people a few weeks back.
Credit card verification is problematic also, just need to try a few times with a few different cards. It's just the buggy nature of CEX. I mean they are not perfect but at least they are not Kraken.

I think minimum buy is 0.01 BTC. ETH is 0.1

2 weeks is really long. Are they really not responding to your email? I mean, I'm still using it, so if their service has suddenly became so shit I would be worried too.

Also I think the easiest way to buy coin from there would be setting a limit buy but even then I think the minimum is 0.01 BTC.

Do your apology in video bro. Cry and all. You lost, and owns 1.85. Pay up or shut up. If you didn't lose anything you don't learn any lesson. Talk is cheap. Don't hide behind "I love Bitcoin" . You not honouring an agreement got nothing to do with how much you believe in BTC.
