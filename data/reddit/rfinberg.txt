In the case of FXOpen they aren't offering synthetic bitcoin trading like many of the others

Hi - I am the author of the post.  Seems like they are keeping this for now as a proprietary item they use for their research. But you can follow or subscribe to their updates here

Awesome, thanks

I would have to be if I was holding other peoples money.  With the exception of the US between 2005-08 (and we know how that turned out), no bank gives loans without seeing some sort of earnings and existing wealth indication from its customers first.

I don't see how MtGox survives this.  On the bright side, their failure should lead to greater transparency from other exchanges on reporting their financial position.

received it as a subscriber.  You can PM an addy and I can forward

Even if the fresh coins are causing the glitch, it doesn't answer why they haven't been able to come forward with publicly explaining the problem or whether internal tampering in their code had been conducted to create this problem.  The biggest problem with MtGox is that they've never really been known for their transparency.  Not that other exchanges have been, but it was their market to lose, which they obviously lost.

As an update - confirmed with the writer that he was referring to another deal and not last week's RTBTC acquisition

Ron from DC Magnates here, we just released our first app, with multi currency charts and updates of content from our site. 
Taken a while to get it off the ground so we are excited about this.  Eager to get feedback from Reddit
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:36:44
fair enough

NYSE involvement is interesting since Nasdaq was rumored last year to be investigating whether to get involved in the space

details through PM? gotta provide some something first , don't want to sign up for more info and get spammed
@_date: 2013-05-05 09:26:14
ideally it would include on one page
1)open positions
2)order ticket
3)basic chart with market depth of a few points deep
4)account balance with real time P&amp;L

Not really - there are some exchanges like BTC-e and Bitfinex that offer short sales as customers can offer bitcoins for lending (similar to stocks which can be shorted if they are in margin accounts).  But, liquidity is minimal.  Hedging a anything more than a $1mil is difficult and costly (high yields).  
In terms of options or futures, there are some individuals that have created products, but they don't trade dynamically and usually have a short duration.  Also, liquidity is limited. 
But, we are slowly getting there.  I have seen plans where a firm wanted to create a derivative exchange that would be targeted to miners.  However, I am not sure how many miners are looking to lock in profits and would rather just hold.  
Overall, infrastructure is being built, but liquidity of willing lenders and producers is negligible for any large business to use to hedge their currency risk.

wow - he came around, not long ago (in April) he was bearish since it kept getting hacked.  Shows the respect Naval has
@_date: 2013-05-16 20:20:03
solid write up - just curious, being that sales are with bitcoins, do they handle returns?  
@_date: 2013-12-22 13:51:36
So will Byrne be shorting bitcoins to hedge payment risks?

Last month I published an article mentioning that large institutions seemed likely to jump on the P2P bandwagon.  (comments on reddit  ) 
Cross border transfers are a pain, and banks are killing it with charges, so there is room for massive disruption.  Its true that a bank led bitcoin would be centralized,  but if it can deliver a product that is cheaper and more efficient,  it could easily get traction. 
I think this comes down to a P2P play, and we'll eventually be seeing hybrids of backed and non-backed currencies.  For bitcoin, the more comfortable the world gets with the P2P platform, the more comfortable people will be to use a non-backed currency like bitcoins with counterparties that they trust.

forget about rubles, I am talking about even a major currency - anyone I know that comes from Europe or the UK grabs some cash from an ATM and uses their credit card.  
Even in NYC, some guy from France got laughed at when he whipped at Euros at any tourist type spot
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:56:13
yes, that's a good point, especially about the USD received as currency in many countries.  But in the US, anything else is just funny money.

Not even sure if these guys have a real say in Israel banking.  Bank of Jerusalem is one of the smaller banks in the country.  The economist probably just wanted to write something that would get published.
@_date: 2013-06-20 12:58:09
IDK - the whole project seems cash intensive.  Would seem to make more sense to fund a startup where their seed money would provide a stronger fire to get the firm off the ground
@_date: 2013-05-26 18:31:25
more than anything, after the events with Liberty Reserve, not knowing any of these payment provider is a little worrisome.  From what I found about PerfectMoney, they are big in the MLM crowd (multi-level-marketing) which is similar to Liberty Reserve.

One of the interesting things about the paper is that it focuses on solving problems with electronic payments and isn't viewed as a replacement for fiat currencies in face to face purchases.
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:03:31

would be interesting to see how refunds work, since there is currency fluctuations

Is ripple the problem or XRPs?  Seems like according to what your are saying, if you strip out opencoin and xrps and rely solely on the IOU backing of ripples, it would be more desirable.  
@_date: 2013-10-08 10:05:25
 - have you announced or are you making any new announcements at the conference? Also, any updates on increasing liquidity?
@_date: 2013-05-05 08:39:43
yup, so you don't need to move between pages.
Also, a little confused by some of the back and forth of Q&amp;A.  
Let me know if these points are correct
1) Kraken is trading platform that contains a central order book to operate as is own bitcoin exchange
2)The trading platform has the ability to be open to integrate order books from different exchanges
3)margin trading is based on Kraken's own lending of funds to customers

typically - forex firms will create minimum limits that will cause your account to automatically get liquidated if you drop below the minimum margin requirements.  This is to keep accounts from going negative.  But when they do go negative if there was a big move, many brokers, especially the market makers (firms taking the other side of the trade) will zero out the account.  Because, if not, most clients would just leave the negative balance and go somewhere else.  
And yes, there are ways to take advantage
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:19:46
I am trying out the platform - nice job - any chance though to have charts and account information on one tab?
@_date: 2013-05-13 07:14:08
stuck behind the paywall, do you have a summary for this article?  TIA

It's a big deal because they have a large merchant list.  But, there is a leap of faith needed to trust these guys.

thinking of writing a separate post about this - but is there any reason why the bitcointip bot can't be used to facilitate sending small payments to each other for freelance type gigs posted on reddit?

From speaking with Hub Culture - they are working on how to go about improving transparency.  At this point, since they are centrally backed, its more of like going to an arcade and buying non-returnable tokens that can be used at their pavilions.  
Their problem is that to create a two way exchange would require them to add financial regulation, since Hub Culture is an actual body that issues the currency.  What they are working on, is trying to find a 3rd party exchange that could deal with redemption.  Its still very much a work in process.  They have some interesting features, such as the centrally backed system which has greater appeal to the general public, but its in a lock-down within their social structure.

It was a bit of a play on Byrne since he was trying to outlaw shorting Overstock shares.
@_date: 2013-04-29 09:57:41
there is bit4x - wrote about them here   
A point of caution - Its an unregulated firm and there was some back and forth about the parent broker in the bitcointalk forum.  But, they do offer bitcoin denominated accounts.  
Etoro was supposed to start accepting them also, but they appear to be dragging their feet
@_date: 2013-05-13 13:51:35
We could see some non-regulated stuff out first.  Having spoken to several startups, they want to get involved with options and could launch them which would force the Regs to make a decision about creating rules.  
@_date: 2013-04-30 11:27:42
Also still see it on my webtrader practice account. Would love to call them and verify - but no tel# in contact page I am seeing.  Just email and fax.

Having spoken to and written about Coinsetter, I have a positive opinion about them.  Just wondering though, why no one talks much about Bitfinex?
@_date: 2013-08-05 14:05:17
they are a top 25 retail broker.  It's a CFD (contract is derived from the price of where BTC/USD is trading), therefore its only 5/24 like the rest of their currency products
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:27:33
so there we go - a crypto currency with just @ $1b in circulation has surpassed arguably the world's most important currency outside of the USD in terms of global usability. 
Not bad

in the good old days of daytrading during the late 90's (before the bots took over) this was fairly common.  Institutions would start entering large bids/offers to flush out smaller players and than it would all disappear.  
Pretty impressive that we've gotten to this point so fast that larger sized traders are seeing enough of profit potential to do the same in bitcoin.  When the API's begin to get stable, widespread adoption of autotrading will probably be next
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:59:55
For what its worth, when trying the platform out, I experienced very fast deposit and withdrawals of litecoins in and out of my account.
