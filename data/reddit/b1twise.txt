This is actually pretty neat.  If there's coverage in the city you want to send to, and it isn't an emergency send... this seems like a good way to go.  I'll have to test it out.  They really need a BPI or BDO to sign on--that would give them much much better coverage.

You should specify the country.
I used WU regularly to remit money to family, and they've blocked me from using them.  They won't say why.  I've taken my business elsewhere.  Fuck WU.

I recently opened two Coinbase accounts, and I needed some support help with both.
The first account was for my personal use.  I tried to buy some BTC and they canceled the order as high risk.  I replied to that email asking what I could do to help the transaction complete, and they replied after about a day with useful feedback.  We went back and forth a few times, and overall the experience was excellent.  Next transaction went through no problem.
The second account I setup was a business account.  I emailed support and got an email in about a day.  This one was trickier, and once the guy didn't really read what I had written, but I just persevered and it all worked out in the end.
Support is harder than you would think to do well--I was impressed with Coinbase.

This.  I live in the Philippines and employ people in the Philippines.  I like bitcoin and all, but it's not going to be an easier process.  I pay my employees by putting their salaries in their bank accounts.  Then they can go to an ATM and pull it out.
Who covers BTC price variability in this case?  Would suck to have the BTC price crash and screw someone who trusts you.

The rent of 22k pesos is pretty low unless you're in a rural area--which will have limits on internet speed.  If you go higher end, its very often the case that the landlord will require postdated checks for each month.  This sets you up such that if your check bounces you've committed estafa, and that's a serious crime.
Also, the internet bill is likely in someone elses name because of a lack of proper ID as a non citizen.
It is, however, cool.  I'm going to test some of it out.

Took the plunge and bought load, sent a remittance to a friend in need, and paid my internet and power bills.  I need to check the power and internet bills to cover my paranoia, but the rest worked out well. Thumbs up.

No XXL, sadness.

The timing sucks...Rebit beat them to the announcement of bills and remittance payment capability.  Also: 
But one aspect that differentiates Palarin from other such services is the way users can share their Bitcoin-related activities with friends on Facebook.
Is this really a useful feature?  Look at me, I just paid my water bill!  Or even worse... Look at me, I just sent my mother 500$!  Could end up in robbery or family and friends showing up to mooch.
I guess competition is good though.

Friendly tip: post to your twitter, FB, etc when you're down and back up.  Also, I didn't check, but it's good to put your blog somewhere else on the net so you can still communicate with that as well.

I've only used Rebit starting this month, but I've used it to put money into a couple of bank accounts.  The bill pay stuff used to live on bills.ninja--which I disliked, but was able to pay my internet and electric bills with.  I plan to pay my rent with Rebit in a couple of days.  It's a pretty big deal.  Most of the banks have an online option to pay some bills, or you can use a lot of ATMs to do it, or you can go to 7eleven and pay.  This just makes it that much easier--especially for those of us who aren't always in the Philippines.
I won't rant too much, but FUCK WU.  They are the most opaque and unhelpful service.  I used them online for a decade, and then they locked me out of online.  Phone app worked for a couple of months, then that stopped working.  It ended up that I had to call them (30$ service charge, ALWAYS misspelled names.) or go to a physical location (crappy hours.)...
This is a pretty big deal.

Who is the best alternative?  They are VC backed, so I don't think they're going to disappear one day and steal my coins.  That same funding is probably why they're uptight about their rules.

For people distant for me, I've had them setup a bank account.  Then you can put a little padding into the bank account for emergencies, and use rebit to add funds.  Also, ATMs are 24hr.  Emergencies will happen.. and it could be at night.  I've had great experience with rebit also.

I don't really count anyone as a professional yet, but exchanges with VC funding are probably the best prepared.
Really, though, don't leave your btc in an exchange... take the extra step.

Protip: store your sekret data on the internet when you travel.
P.P.S: They have printers at your destination.
If you can't handle your security any better than that, you probably shouldn't be listened to.
