Pretty much, ya. Only unique use cases are criminal.

Two possibilities: your bank sucks, or you're doing something hilarious. Number of times my debit card was canceled, in my life: zero.

Used to be many "publicly traded" bitcoin operations, notably ASICminer and Neo&amp;Bee; mostly on unlicensed exchanges like [Havelock]( Mostly ran away with everyone's money/failed. A few remain. There's still a "securities" section on Bitcointalk.com. Mostly dead, but still mostly scams. Mostly.

Microsoft could be selling its software, but also *giving it away, 4free*. It costs Microsoft nothing to let people copy it. And yet, for reasons unknown, MS fights piracy, spending actual money to do it! Why?!
Does this answer your question, or should I elaborate/be more direct?

I have some bad news 4u2: if you're a US citizen, unless you're a tax cheat or are unemployed, you're also giving $$$ to the government.

Should be user-selectable, either in firmware/bios, with dip switch, or jumper settings.

Edit: Also, cars have a taxi-like sign/light on the roof. When "kill pedestrians" option is selected, it displays "Born2kill" in gory red letters. If "kill self" option is chosen, displays "It's a good day2die" in green.

You're assuming that miners will include zero-fee transactions just for lel, because they can? Are they that stupid/shortsighted? By doing that, they'd be killing the cow they hope to milk.
Does Micro$oft give away its software, just because there's no limit to how many copies it could make?

You mean, shut our eyes and hope for the best? That's what many here chose to do, sure. I prefer to; would rather hypothesize/consider less-than-optimal scenarios; possibly prevent them because am not helpless.

I'm sensing some anger here. Pushing meth is also profitable, did OP claim bitcoin wasn't?

I'm not really sure how you stumbled on a piece published on March 31, 2014, but whatevs.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:09:24


Well no, not unless they're bone-stupid. Why would they include zero-fee transactions? Why haven't they been including zero-fee transactions (why were the blocks not constantly topped off to 1MB, even when there were zero-fee transactions to include)?


They *are* close to each other. in China, where the power rates are low &amp; real estate/labor is cheap.


Lots of cripplecoiners pooping their pants, now that big blockers stopped whining &amp; ViaBTC/Bitcoin.com control more than 10% of the hashrate. So much for that 95% consensus &amp; teh Blockstream Dream :)

Came pretty close here.


Yeah. But more similar to thousands of shitcoins.

You're missing the point. If MS gave Office away, it couldn't simultaneously sell Office. And that's why it doesn't give Office away.
Similarly, if miners included transactions for free, they couldn't charge money for providing the same service (including transactions in a solved block), and expect to get paid.
This should be obvious.

A rhetorical question?
@_date: 2016-10-24 13:01:31


Sure, "perfect competition is a hypothetical situation which cannot possibly exist in a market." Bitcoin also fails to meet the criteria. 


Consumers (Bitcoin users) don't have perfect knowledge of the market. This would imply knowing such basics as ...how much they must pay to be included in the next block (tx fee). inb4 "But perfect knowledge of the market includes the knowledge that the market is fundamentally unknowable": No, that's not a perfect market, that's shooting craps.


Labor is cheaper in China; so is electricity; so is timely delivery on boatloads of ASICs manufactured in China. Anything *but* "not hindered by any market factors or market forces." Duh.


Much government intervention. Government subsidized electricity (China); different taxation rates, Bitcoin B&amp; in certain countries; can't mine in Russia. There's that.


Costs money to ship the means of production -- ASICs. And government intervention (tariffs).
So no, Bitcoin mining is anything *but* a perfectly competitive market. I've listed this crap to satisfy the raging pedant in you :)


Of course not, though irrelevant here. You claimed that "[miners not filling up 1MB blocks] was only true when there weren't enough transactions to regularly fill up blocks at 1MB." I pointed out that this was not the case; miners regularly mined empty blocks when mempool had waiting non-zero-fee transactions. Q.E.D. 


Why reach for conspiracies? The assumption that a Chinese pool operator will lie to maximize his profit is no different than one of a used car salesman lying in hopes of maximizing his profit; is based on understanding his rational self-interest. No need for Saurian lizards or thermite, judicious application of Occam's razor will suffice :)

Is your assumption that it will be $50k in 5 years one of those?


I don't think you quite understand how debt works, who the debt is owed to, or that, by switching currencies, you don't magically become immune to the economic collapse you've been dreaming about.

What incentive is there for miners to include a zero-fee tx?
@_date: 2016-10-19 12:15:20


Not a dry seat in the house.

When lrn2 electricity back2 coal, we can closed-loop Bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2016-10-20 17:33:03


No, it isn't. It would be, if the pool owners didn't know each other and didn't know that they could make more by ~~colluding~~ cooperating and by leveraging their hashpower by throwing it behind different developer consortia, but you need a freshman-in-highschool's understanding of economics to recognize it.


No, i mean what I said and what you've quoted: "(why were the blocks not constantly topped off to 1MB, **even when there were zero-fee transactions to include**)"


Lol sure, most of the miners are actually in Australia, where electricity is pricey. Because miners are insane and prefer to mine at a loss.


It's OK to cry tho.
@_date: 2016-10-21 14:53:54


Yeah, it is. I'm gonna go ahead and take it down a notch, explain a few basics. 
Imagine a small market: Bob and I are selling crack from our respective stoops. To crack whores. Each time I drop my price, Bob one-ups me and drops his more. We do this until both Bob and I are barely eking out a living. Perfect competition :(
...until I come on over to Bob's stoop and say "yo, 'tsup. Instead of undercutting each other, let's collude/cooperate; jack our prices to $5 a crumb, and we'll be fartin' through silk." Bob likes the idea, agrees to sell rock @ our agreed-upon $5; we both stack cheddar because no longer "perfectly competitive" but *cooperative*. Because cooperation is *not* perfect competition.
So now you know.


No. Not unless you think that empty blocks were never mined when mempool had transactions waiting. In which case you should check your facts. 


Again, you appear to be missing the nuanced difference between "they don't know" and "they're lying through their teeth." 
When a used car salesman tells me "20k is the best I can do" &amp; I continue haggling, it's not because I (mistakenly) believe that he doesn't realize that he can do better and/or has made an accounting error in calculating his costs and expenses. No. I'm doing it because I believe that used car salesmen are profit-motivated, and are not above fibbing if fibbing serves that end.
If there's anything else I could clear up for you, you just go ahead and ask.

It's like this: You drink from the urinal, and justify it with "Well, your town water has some piss in it too!" Sure, it does, but the stuff you're chugging is pretty much straight pee, while what comes out of my tap is &lt; 1ppm.
It's a nuanced thing, a question of degree.
