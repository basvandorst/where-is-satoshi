I feel I grasp the math/science of this, but my gut just tells me not to change this.  I know everyone is up and down, but I just hope the concept withstands THIS stress test (dividing &amp; conquering).

in a heartbeat.  I'm dedicated to bitcoin and i would rather accept bitcoin than deal with all the bullshit that goes along with trying to collect USD.  with this single, when we started getting all these 1$ Paypal orders, they put our account on hold accepting NO purchases until we added our TAX ID.  It cut us out of at least 36 hours of purchases before we caught it.  With bitcoin, no one was between us and the fans.  It was easy, fast and without drama.  Bam.  I can put everything we do POST Universal South (pre-2008).  Everything physical is available via bitcoin, and very soon everything 2008+ will be available via bitcoin digitally and physically.

My two cents: a fidonet integration of the blockchain (for countries where Internet could be censored) &amp; a proof of ownership of music in the blockchain. Peertracks is cool but concerned about the public buying coins etc. Could be better if a song is published on a blockchain and linked forever to an artist. Then allow streaming for micropayments which go directly to the artist.
 &gt;Hi! I'm a web developer fascinated with bitcoin possibilities and I have too much free time right now:)

Me too
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:47:46
The other side of it is that I'm not a very experienced coder.  I know a little here and there, but to go in and mess with Fidonet, I would need someone who wanted to help me.  I know how it works and I know the inside and outside of the BBS side and Fidonet, we would just have to customize some elements of the mail tossers and create a "base" dedicated to the blockchain.   
So there's that.  I'm willing to bust my ass for bitcoin and never make a dime doing it, so hopefully some coder out there would want to help me take this on.  The greatest coder of all for this would be the originator himself, Tom Jennings, but if he's not interested, I still would like to attempt to make it happen on an alpha level.
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:27:32
Well, what I'm really thinking about is it serving two purposes: 
1. a backup that isn't reliant on the internet being available 
2. the ability for nations that have censorship of bitcoin/internet to be able to use bitcoin via a telephone connection.  
Based on my knowledge of Fidonet, it seems it would work like this:
Say my BBS, which is connected to the internet and available via telnet, is up and is part of this network.  Someone in say Egypt, who for whatever reason is not able to use the internet but wants to send bitcoin across the world.  They could send a transaction (more on this later, because you then could begin to build bitcoin wallets on BBS' if it became something enough people relied on) and then use their telephone line to dial into a BBS which would collect that transaction ID, spread it throughout the fidonet network until it reaches a BBS that is connected to the internet, and then this transaction is logged.  All at the same time, each block (which are very small in size) that is completed would then in turn be sent to the entire fidonet network, and once the Egyptian BBS connects again to the fidonet hub, the new block checks against his transaction block and so on and the blockchain is updated.  
If this was in place, and bitcoin transactions over the internet were banned, say by ISP's, the blockchain would still be in tact and functional.
The other reason I bring this up is that there are still globally tons of BBS systems or Fidonet implemented systems world-wide because it is often the only uncensored resource to reach out in some areas.
If you google around you can find a fidonet nodelist broken down into regions (countrys) and zones (states) etc...  It's pretty impressive that the infrastructure is still in place and very strongly still setup.
I also know there is a legion of people who have taken their BBS' down in America and Europe that would be come excited again to have them become active, even just as a backup support to the blockchain.

Just to clarify, the vinyls are mostly Country centric but overall the music appeals to a much larger base. My album Black Ribbons features Stephen King as a radio DJ on his last broadcast before the airwaves become totally government - centralized. Have fun, because on that day 10 dollar digital downloads will be 3.33

Hey man, heads up.  For Bitcoin Black Friday all the way thru Monday we will be offering EVERYTHING my label has released as well as everything I've released since 2008 for 75 percent off.  That's 2$ albums and shit...  Bitcoin only.  The real tip is, it's already live:
Enjoy, thanks for the support!

@_date: 2014-12-27 06:26:20
Im not sure of the answer to this question, but my bet would be that the overall tx for 2014 are double that of 2013 and that the Black Friday volume was slightly lower than 2013 because of the fact that overall tx was higher.  Who knows.  I know I spent thousands.

This is interesting.  Do you have to start an account with you to view them?  I wish you could facilitate payment through ChangeTip.  It's the wallet that people don't realize they have.  Fascinating man.  If a video had enough heat on it, it could blow you guys up.  But the ease of use has to be just like YouTube...  Gonna keep you on my radar.

I got a gold cap today. I feel cool like I look like joe pesci in Home Alone. Does anyone actually care about GAW, Hashlets, or any weird pump and dump altcoin. Give me a break. Anyone involved with this company should get out now and save your money. Bitcoin is low now but we have a much more realistic ceiling and basement financially and everyone needs to stop worrying about making millions on an altcoin or cloud mining. Cloud mining means when they aren't making money they pull the plug. Look at CEX. Cloud mining sold on eBay for life. Give me a break. Every miner is and will be profitable. Depending on what u spend u make a little more generally for your support. GAW and anyone else claiming to have figured out a new way are fraud and you stay away

Except with Coinbase they are reporting the transfer as a sale. It'll never hold water. You can fight this.

I'll be coming. Altho the service charges are high on those things I use them to deposit small amounts and take out cash. Locali got rid of theirs so I'm very happy you are around!!  LA rules for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:55:45
I just saw that in your post after I had posted. Bravo on those %. Locali was is a health food place on Franklin near Bronson that had a robocoin for a while. I may have been the only person to use it. Problem was they had one but didn't really use bitcoin themselves it seemed. And the crossover with health food and bitcoin didn't seem productive. Excited to check out your place and meet u and talk about what you're doing with smart contracts.

Whatever happened to the bitcoin mining lightbulb bitfury was developing?
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:31:22
This is what I was really trying to say. That this proves that it is EASY enough for 91 percent of the people who google bitcoin buy it or get involved somehow.
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:29:01
To me, all this data does is prove the Bitcoin is scalable with rising demand, and performing better than most hoped.

Good conversation. I think in light of the Interview stuff and the state of the Music business with Google strong arming artists to be part of the Music Key. (Read this article NOW:  )... Having a "proof of creation system to lock each new release to its creator via the blockchain or sidechains, colored coins etc... And also a decentralized streaming system that pays artists directly without a central bank (Spotify, Pandora, music key) is the move. With this directors, writers, producers, labels and big name artists would embrace the platform. 
That's my two cents.
