I encourage . . . the expansion of the bitcoin world . . . only because out of twenty people I talk to . ..  0 knew, what a bitcoin is.   so maybe . .. they can learn.

What are it's draw backs?   
It just blows away in the wind. 
It just fades in sunlight.
Cats fur erases bitcoin. 
A dog barking upsets the block chain. 
You can lose your bitcoin like you can lose your house if you forget where you live.

Grins.   This is going to be the common reaction.  
Mr. John Q. Average has no Idea what bitcoin is other that what the talking heads on the tube tell him.  "The oft shady world of bitcoin."  Then,  "Mt. Gox."  Then, "Silk Road and drugs."  So if Peter Todd want to pile on another layer of suspect activity he is doing a disservice.   I can hear it now.  "A tool that make it easy to double spend bitcoin has now been invented."  "Good luck storming the castle!"    And yeah:  Bitcoin, shinny rocks, and shorting the DOW.  it's been a good week.

@_date: 2016-01-16 13:41:52
Yes, it was a resounding success!   . . . More importantly, I discovered another crypto-currency    And will soon make the transformation complete.

I'm confused . . . Bitcoin is up from where I bought it?!  I'm no investment wizard . . . but, that's good . . . right?

I love reading this . . . because it reminds me; that, don't put anymore money into Bitcoin.    I mean, not anymore that I will lose. . .  . I mean, could possibly loose.  Because: People.

@_date: 2016-01-19 08:31:25
I am very new to Bitcoin.  I engage in pleasant conversation where ever I go.  Up until:   Whenever I say I have bought some Bitcoin . . . people look at me as if I had dropped off the flat earth. Why is that?   
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:22:01
Dead . . . and risen?  OOOOOOOHHHHHH"

So I'm not getting litecoin?   Just rabbit turds?  How many rabbit turds will I get? 
I mean . . . as long as they send them.   Honestly it's kinda of a 'win-win'. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 02:22:30
Is Bitcoin all about the "Price?"  I like that the price went up . ..  but, if that's it . . . then it will go down.   
@_date: 2016-01-12 05:55:19
"the comments are sure to spark speculation that that company is at least aware of the technology."    Ya think?!  
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:53:07

You are welcome.

"The Age of Crypto-currency"   by Paul Vigna, and Michael J. Casey, is the best read I have found. (gives the most complete history of the people involved.)  
  Another that explains well is; Blockchain Revolution by Don Tapscott , and Alex Tapscott.
