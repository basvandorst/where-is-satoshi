I can second this, I've used BMO for deposits and withdrawals for Cavirtex and Coinbase, no problems.

It's a fundamentally different platform. Go read the whitepaper and/or check out the ethereum website.

Former Ethertarian, i.e. bought at the top and is now supremely butthurt.

Lol these prove nothing, nor do you directly tell people to get out. Either you got burnt buying at $21 with the DAOsaster, or you're just here trollin' around, shilling BTC, generally being negative, and unable to analyze anything with a level head.

Yep, you got me.

Well Core seems to be able to put the breaks on the block size limit. They also seem to have decided that "layer 2 solutions are ready and being used". Why couldn't that be decided in the future? Quit it with the nonsense logic:

Indeed, which is why blockstream/core refuses to make a common sense change to a parameter, blocksize, despite Satoshi himself stating the 1MB limit was arbitrary. They need Bitcoin to be a "settlement layer" so that they can use the layer-2 patents(sidechains) they have to do business down the road. Thus they hobble Bitcoin with high fees and slow transactions, and censor any divergent, sensible, views on ~public forums, creating an echo chamber that convinces newcomers of their righteousness, all while hypocritically touting "censorship resistance" as their prime initiative, seemingly unaware that full blocks and high fees are also very much a form of censorship. It must be resisted indeed. Kick the can down the road I say, because Bitcoin is supposed to be peer-to-peer digital cash, not peer-to-blockstream-to-peer cash. A blocksize increase certainly isn't the final solution, but tearing the community apart over such a trivial thing is suspicious at best. If they were really worried about miner centralization i.e. "censorship resistance", we would be talking about ASIC resistance and alternate proof protocols etc.

Uh yes, the developers that bloody invented the thing, and have the most knowledge of the system, are allowed to "think" and have and share those opinions. The many people that aren't so technically adept are free to consider and agree with those thoughts, OR NOT. Anybody is free to disagree, and some do, and we have ETC now. Do you see anybody outside of crypto printing currency in the states? Not so easy to say no to the fed; bad comparison.

Maybe read the comment I replied to again for context...but good job.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:53:26
You're forcing your viewpoint instead of trying to understand the point of the comment. We get it, ETH is suuuper different because it was distributed "differently", Bitcoin is the "one true coin" yada yada... As you acknowledged: " is saying that ETH is like buying a stock, and that they are hoping it will increase in value. You replied asking [sardonically] how bitcoin is different." Full stop homie. I think, pretty obviously I wasn't looking for an analysis of how the coins differ, the implication was that if simplistic analysis was "people are only buying eth because they're hoping it will go up in value, and therefore it's a security", then, bitcoin is no different. I was replying to comment; context. To address your comments though, if you think the SEC gives a fuck about or distinguishes between a swiss corp. crowdfunding via a premine, but not about some anonymous "Satoshi" character mining 1MM bitcoin, "early adopters" having large sums, and miners manipulating the markets, then, you are trippin' my friend. Yea ETH is a security, but BTC magically isn't, good fucking luck.
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:38:36
It would still qualify as a security.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:32:59
Then Bitcoin is different how?
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:13:18
*I* answered sardonically. Come on man...to clarify "Then Bitcoin is different how?", was sardonic. It was rhetorical. K byyeee.
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:32:57
Aaaall good, I probably could have been more clear with that, forgive my poor manners, jaded from too many troll battles...
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:09:01
Bitstamp is freaking out/glitching, possibly spooking the whole market?
