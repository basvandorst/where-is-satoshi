Well it isn't like Japan is going to change their monetary policy to have fixed supply and act like Bitcoin, but it means that a form of JPY will exist on a blockchain that is just as authentic as physical Yen notes are.  That means that you don't need another intermediary to settle the fiat payment like in other systems.  But I don't know if this service will be something available to the general public since Liquid enables confidential transactions and the only way to audit those are if you consent to it, so the government might not like that idea.  But for institutions that is less of a concern since they can be audited.

It probably means that Blockstream is trying to get fiat tokens issued on their Liquid platform for institutions so they can use it as a replacement for the existing financial interchange system.  OTC markets basically mean an exchange that services institutional investors rather than retail, so basically Liquid would be the way institutions settle payments rather than through banks and having to wait ages for those transactions to clear.  Since Liquid is a sidechain of Bitcoin, it means that it would not so difficult to allow money to flow both directions, (at least for institutions, I don't think this will service retail investors unless a partner provides that service).

Yeah, it will be really interesting if it makes it to that point.

So my understanding is that in the UASF, UASF nodes will treat blocks not signalling segwit as invalid.  Here is what I understand it to look like:
X = Block mined without segwit signalling  
S = Block mined with segwit signalling  
If the blockchain looked something like this:
X - X - S - X - X - S - S - X - X
Then the UASF nodes would only accept the three S blocks.  Additionally, the UASF nodes would treat the transactions in the X blocks as never happening.  This means that should the UASF achieve a majority and succeed (the miners all start signalling S) then all transactions from the X blocks are erased (the other chain).  If the miners decide to attack the UASF by marking their blocks as invalid, then the blockchain will look like just all the X blocks, and all the transactions in the S blocks will are erased if the UASF fails to achieve its objective or the miners suddenly broadcast all the X blocks at once.  In either case, it seems to me there is risk of annihilation of the weaker side.

Oh so its even worse than just two chains, UASF nodes also reject segwit signalling blocks too?

Can you briefly explain how that's different from the scenario I just described?  What does the PoW modification mean?

Please explain to me what legal grounds exist to protect a cryptocurrency, I don't know of any and so suing does not seem feasible.  
Also the legacy miners have a strong incentive to protect the legacy chain if they believe it is more profitable for them to do so, even if it means a short term decrease in profit.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the problem is that there is a risk of not just a chain split, but of actual chain annihilation in the UASF scenario.  This could be achieved by miners if they decide to mine a bunch of blocks to invalidate the UASF chain, which could destroy all transactions made by UASF nodes.  If the UASF succeeds, then the entire chain that isn't part of the UASF will also be annhilated.  I think a chain split is only going to be a temporary state, with drastic consequences at its resolution.  To me the safest option is just wait it out because any transactions during the potential dual chain state could be at risk of being reverted.

Would you care to point out where I'm mistaken?  Even if "I'm wrong" it doesn't really help me much without seeing where.

Not if his transaction keeps getting rebroadcasted.
