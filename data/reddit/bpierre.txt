It seems pretty clear to me:

Have you checked the article history? The Bitcoin symbol paragraph has been edited multiple times, by different authors, and they seem pretty legit IMO.
* 14 June 2012: the paragraph [has been added]( by [Stephenjudge]( Comment: “Added an example of a modern day use of the letter Ƀ as part of a proposed digital currency symbol.”
* 27 March 2013: it [has been edited]( by [LFaraone]( Comment: “place the link better”.
* 24 April 2013: it [has been removed]( by [Your Lord and Master]( (account deleted). Comment: “rm spam”.
* 5 April 2014: a new paragraph about the Bitcoin symbol [has been created]( by [83.163.134.101]( No comment.
* The same day, it [has been edited]( again by [83.163.134.101]( This user has also edited other sections of the article, non related to the Bitcoin symbol. No comment.
* 10 April 2014: the paragraph [has been removed]( by [221.133.42.98]( No comment.
Wikipedia doesn’t care about the fact you like it or not, or if it’s controversial: the Ƀ symbol exists, and is quite known by the community. I guess it will be added again at some time in the future.
