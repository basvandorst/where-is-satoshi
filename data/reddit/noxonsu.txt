One of the reason of creating our cross-blockchain wallet with Atomic Swaps for major tokens and cryptocurrencies is to protect users from such situation - centralized exchanges are so centralized!

In my opinion, Lightnig Network technology is much better than SewWit, it's faster and allows us to provide new technology, Atomic Swap, which allows to do crosschin exchanges. Segwit can't provide it

Congratulations with that, mate. My team and me are developing BTC atomic swaps [ with other coins and we we be using Lightning NEtwork as well!

I guess the should also say Bitcoin Gold is not Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic is not Ethereum and other obvious things.

Why there is so much hype about Bitcoin ETF? I really do not understand - for me personally it doesnt mean anything - it just for speculate traders want to raise there funds, meanwhile both bitcoin and blockchain industry in general grows and develops - a new technologies being implemented (like lightning, cross-chain, atomic swap) - and more real world services adding crypto as payment method - why such news dont attract so much attention, as ETF?

Well, soon enough we will launch trades with several stablecoins(USDT, PAX, EURS) - you could buy/sell them in pair with BTC by using Atomic Swap - absolutely decentralized

Very interesting. The point is that restricted emission of BTC will cause its price up to 100k at least. We need another crypto.
