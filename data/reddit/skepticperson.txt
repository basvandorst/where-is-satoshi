Ok, I can do this all day every day too. It is mildly amusing reading your drivel, and watching you pretend to be someone you are not.
*You've presented zero independent thoughts and zero original arguments*
You are an original and independent thinker?  Which part is that?
*The pharmaceutical industry blah blah blah*
So, again, who makes these legal drugs? How are they made cheaper? Cost is a major factor in light of the present available actual DATA on why there continues to be a black market. But hey, studies suggest...who is the parrot?
*Historically, people like you who shut down and ridicule new approaches to the problems caused by drugs, have made it quite difficult to talk about it, much less actually try. That's changing now, and in time your kind might lose out, and the world will be better for it.*
People like me, my kind, you love labelling others you don't have a clue about. You believe I am pro-authoritarianism ( BOY you don't know me lol ), I believe more and more you are not particularly intelligent. Just verbose. I'm not ridiculing any approach to reforming drug policy, I am ridiculing you.
*Go watch the History Channel...*
I don't do television. Maybe you should turn yours off, or sell it.
*and tell yourself your learning things.*
**You're** clearly unable to learn the one thing which might improve **your** credibility. Nuff said. I love learning. Nothing to see in your case.
*The ability to do transactions of value without begging for permission from your precious society will never go away, the cat is out of the bag. This is what bitcoin represents at its core. You lose.*
WRONG AGAIN, maestro. I win :) BTW it is your society too and it is precious. Being anti-establishment is easy, participating is much harder, but more rewarding.

Thanks Horatio!
*nobody is talking about allowing acts of violence by drug users. There's no disagreement.*
Good we are in agreement then that society uses laws to protect the innocent from such acts by preventing them as far as is possible in the first place. Like preventing the **general public** from the idiotic idea of easier access to hard drugs, which was my original point.
*Murder is by definition* ***not*** *a victimless crime*
Neither is a drug abuser, strung out and slicing somebody up. Or not feeding her baby. Duh. You like stating the obvious that's for sure.
*due to the mishandling of drug policies by people like you*

*drugs are a direct gateway for kids to the criminal world.*
so let's put them in corner stores. See, that's my beef with the guy before you. I don't really care about you anymore..
 *"illegal for \[a\] very good reason"*
No I wrote it correctly, thanks. Don't be butthurt because 'you're' grammar is bad..
*drugs are illegal because people with limited knowledge, elected by people with limited knowledge are trying to solve issues that are complex.*
Well, I didn't say the system is perfect, did I? Maybe we should start electing crackheads?

Why add to society's problems? Why would a society want this? There is nothing good from providing heavily addictive and life-destroying drugs to a wider public. It is your right to eat donuts until you explode. Obesity is epidemic because cheap shitty food ( like that shitty flavorless broccoli ) is being sold in stores that used to be a lot smaller since it didn't have literally half the store filled with junk food, littered with sugar. Tragically, few people know what it is like to eat your own home-grown, fantastic food. Like a fresh potato, or carrot. Instead, they buy a box of sugar.
Unfortunately, for the moment, corporations control society. But I digress somewhat.
Yeah, duty. Freedom from whatever tyranny that is not this system of government, this society is only sustainable through the duty of a society to uphold individual rights and freedoms. However, if something goes against the general well-being of the society ( as decided by that society, presumably ), why adopt it? In other words, you do not have the right to do whatever the fuck you want. EDIT Neither do I.

@_date: 2019-07-11 05:44:31
Lol @ authoritarian. You view society as a large inhuman evil force? What do you think society should be, anarchy? Bacchanalia? At any rate...
*Why is it up to society in the first place?*
What are you, a Russian operative? Why is it up to society to have rule of law? Probably because it kind of helps to keep us a society. 
*What if a lot of people started growing their own food, and society figured out that this trend was causing significant issues for the established food industry?* 
Fantastic. Not everything in society works correctly, until we decide to fix it. That is, until you have a society of anarchists. Then you don't have a society anymore. 
In fact, it constantly changes, so we always need to be on 'duty'...You are honestly comparing hard drug abuse ( extremely not healthy/causes violence/crimes )  with growing fresh vegetables ( extremely healthy )? Laughable comparison. If you ate an apple and then wanted to murder people as a result, perhaps I would reconsider.
*Given your authoritarian beliefs, if such a thing were to happen, homegrown food ought to be banned.*
Given that I have no authoritarian beliefs I should welcome open revolt if corporations, not society somehow enforced this.  I highly doubt any society that works for the benefit of all would want to ban growing food. They might want to keep drugs known to cause a myriad of social woes out of the hands of the public as best it can. Unfortunately there are authoritarian regimes and so-called democratic countries that allow drugs to flourish, making it much more difficult. Hard drugs being allowed into society as acceptable would certainly feed into the desires of say, Russian operatives, or drug abusers who are looking to disrupt society in nefarious ways, certainly not democratic ways.
*On victimless actions, there should be no authority at all. Sure, drugs may have victims when they're abused by certain people*
If you view chronic heroin/meth addiction by most people as victimless, there are plenty of people, family mostly, ready to dispute that.  That's my extremely nice, bite-my-tongue answer.
*which leaves it up to politicians to draw the lines*
Everyone has this responsibility. Maybe that's why you view government as evil, you don't participate. 
*Politicians are elected by average people, who are objectively far from the smartest or most knowledgable people.*
Got a better attempt at Utopia? Heroin and anarchy? 
I'm really kind of tired of typing at you about this. Here's my view, hard drugs--bad for society, don't legalise them and don't make them more accessible. Eat your vegetables though, if you know what's good for you.

*I'm going to skip the increasing number of grammar points your bringing up.*
Save "you're" energy for class.
*This claim has no basis in theory nor in practice, unless your talking about the state itself actually being responsible for manufacturing and distributing the drugs, which is irrelevant.*
Who makes these legal drugs? Extremely relevant to both supply chain and costs. I've never known the pharmaceutical industry to pass up an opportunity to rape their customers, for example.
*The information is open to access, so I suggest that you try to find it independently on your own, and if you fail to do it, I'll walk you through it.*
Where would I be without you? Oh right, google. Are you actually trying to convince me you didn't just search google? Am I laughing right now?
*You are not a pietist, not by any stretch of the imagination.* 
No, I am a parrot according to you.
\[church diatribe\]...*Nowadays you don't have to be a pietist to believe these things, it's the default position for any person who haven't looked into it.*
You like telling me what I am, don't you? What are you, Ivan? Godless communist? ( rhetorical, tongue-in-cheek question ) 
On another front, how many heroin addicts are going to enter a government controlled drug emporium and be witnessed buying amounts of heroin? Actual facts suggest they tend to avoid such situations. Also, weed prices are almost(?) always higher in legal stores, in Canada and the US. Perhaps it will balance out someday. Perhaps, pun intended, that's a pipe dream. Studies suggest one thing, and I would agree they are valid studies. 
To me, meth and heroin are not a part of a "pursuit of happiness" but a concerted attack on our society. I don't require God's wrath to establish that concern, just the knowledge that these drugs do nothing but create addicts, and ruin lives. But hey, if your stance is correct and legalisation ends up solving this massive problem then I might change my tune. I won't hold my breath. Reply if you wish, I'm done, bye bye.

Society has every right and a DUTY to collectively decide that intentionally increasing crime rates -- caused by increased drug addictions, not to mention adding to health care burdens, already over-stressed, due to the inevitable increase in overdoses -- is inherently a very bad idea. If you think you have the right to so something that society has deemed illegal, usually for good reasons, your choice, couldn't care less.

*Urban areas with low socioeconomic standing that are prone to being ravaged by widespread drug abuse, already have a guy selling drugs on the corner. Behind him there's a gang providing protection and waging turf wars with other gangs for that specific corner. Behind the gangs, organized crime syndicates are selling these drugs which are being bought from all kinds of bad, including human traffickers, terrorists, etc.*

This made me giggle. You quoted me, there is no need to alter the quote, since it works in your sentence quite well. Nice try though. Actually not.
*What would actually happen if the legit shop at that corner in the projects started selling those same drugs as are already offered, for a fraction of the price?...*
Full stop. A fraction of the price? You'd still have two markets, the government controlled expensive one and the much more established illegal trade at lower prices I should think. But I am not an expert like you lol.
*You want 'crime' to be defined as actions that the uninformed majority defines as illegal.*
No I want crime to go away, but since it won't society must deal with it I guess.
*I want 'crime' to be defined as actions that are directly harmful to other humans.*
Such as drug abusers committing these crimes directly linked to their addictions. I guess we are in agreement again. I guess that's why society has penalties for such crimes. I guess there is no way to rationalise that there is a direct link to crime and hard drugs, and I guess selling these drugs in corner stores is a bad idea. It is certainly not a good idea. Which is what I was talking about at the start of all this worthless diatribe.
*You want a reactionary approach to the problems caused by drugs.*
Wrong again chief.

*The new law maintained the status of illegality for using or possessing any drug for personal use without authorization.*
*Data about the heroin usage rates of 13-16-year-olds from EMCDDA were used to claim that "decriminalization" has had no adverse effect on drug usage rates. However, drug-related pathologies - such as sexually transmitted diseases and deaths due to drug usage - have decreased dramatically.*

*Doing shit illegally has a lot of added costs due to risks, limitations in operations, etc. It's basic economics. I can explain further if you don't understand this.*
That's deep. Yawn. Government controlled drug distribution would always be more expensive than any illegal operation. Simpler economics. Security over supply ( manufacturing ), salaried and highly trained personnel ( many ), quality control, certifications, taxes.... the legal route is always more expensive. This is why crime pays. If you can't understand that, I feel sorry for you. But then you've been talking out of your ass this whole time. It is hard to feel sorry for a talking ass.

*Limiting government authority over individuals, over what we do with our bodies, is not anarchism.*
Requiring law to limit or yes deny individuals' rights to **act out** while messed up on drugs proven to be harmful to society ( look it up if your common sense isn't working, google, SCIENCE... )  is certainly an acceptable and sane practice, since it works better than not.
*giving the state any and all authority for the "betterment of society"*
I guess you really don't have a clue what governance is, but hey, Russia.
*and that this philosophy of state has allowed a short-legged, ill-tempered man to run our economy to the ground while plundering our industries and oppressing several minorities who are not deemed "good for society".*
Yes, Mother Russia certainly is a mess, however it has a long history of being so, and started it's unprepared journey into democracy(?) within a well-established system of corruption. In short, a power vacuum. We don't have that situation where I live, yet we have working rule of law, allowing the individual CERTAIN rights and freedoms, as in, murder is illegal. There are penalties for murder, is that an evil authoritarian state control? I would hope you could grasp that simple truth.
*You're arguing as if it's a given that decriminalisation of drugs would cause a proliferation of drugs.*
Nah, nah, nah nah nah..
You can ask what I am 'arguing' if you want my answer, instead of warping it into something it is not. Legalising ( back to the original dude's opinion I was commenting on ) 'heroine' for instance and selling it in a heroin store is insane. Doesn't get my vote, ever. Weed, great. No big deal. Doesn't lead to crime ( while not behind the wheel ), just a bag of doritos and an orange erection. Yet a couple in this thread say this (not allowing the sale of heroin) goes against basic individual rights. Sorry, society has laws for this reason, so that crackheads aren't allowed carte blanche, so that murderers can't murder with impunity, etc. You are more than welcome to try to change the law, or perhaps avoid drug use if possible. Isn't democratic society great?
Why would any healthy society want to allow a product so harmful, with zero benefits and a multitude of negative effects, when it is illegal for very good reason? So that a junkie can buy it more conveniently? Brilliant.. truly logical. Flawless. Decriminalisation and substance control ( not offering it to the general public, not charging the hopelessly addicted and leaving them to rot in jail but instead helping them as much as possible ), great idea. If it works. Treating the symptom though. Because yes, hard drug addiction is a societal disease.

Ad hominem outbursts aside, it is a lame meme, used poorly. I understand the definition of word salad, and in case you don't understand ( I can't imagine why ) I used it as a derogatory insult. I understand what your word salad means, and gosh, I remain unimpressed. Your continual need to defend your lousy meme in the face of my 'intransigence' is why I keep coming back! 
MOST people haven't even bothered to stare blankly at yet another lame post on Reddit( at least 8, outstanding ). In short: nobody cares. Why you have such a burning need to convert me to the brilliance of your erudite and inciteful contribution to the security of the future of finance is somewhat bewildering, if not downright pathetic.

"probably...likelier...almost certainly" 
These are disclaimers 
"We can definitely paint a pretty accurate picture of the future by using broader strokes." This actually says nothing of substance. Nostradamus was a master at saying nothing and being revered(?) for it 
"In some cases, such as astronomical events, we can be almost 100% accurate" 
Apart from the disclaimer, perhaps by comparing the laws of physics with the laws of the jungle you are hinting at Game Theory? ( Kepler, Galileo, Copernicus are personal heroes to me btw ) 
Don't get me wrong, science uses prediction models every day to keep humans safe, I understand the value of prediction. Predicting the future of highly speculative vehicles in a highly corrupt world is a dangerous game to be confident about.

The price based on past performance, particularly the now-famous logarithmic regression chart would rise from maybe $13,000 after May 2020, possibly doubling by August and from there approaching $100,000 by the end of 2021.

Owning cryptocurrency isn't an achievement, it is simply speculation, assuming you are buying/selling it based on it's future value. Assuming you are long I could say "good job!" if and when it skyrockets, or say "bad choice!" if it is relatively worthless in the future. If you need a pat on the back for owning 1/10th of today's BTCUSD pairing, you might want to seriously consider the emotional turmoil you face when making decisions about much larger sums. Money isn't worth dying of stress. Park it, toil on, be willing to lose it all without regret.
