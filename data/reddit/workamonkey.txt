You took a gamble and it paid off. For other people they may not be so lucky.
Let's be honest, no one knows where Bitcoin will be tomorrow, let along a month/year down the line. For someone to prioritize Bitcoin over debt they are taking the risk that they will be much worse off financially over the safe option of paying off debt they know they are going to need to pay.

A correction would apply when something has built up a lot of hype and momentum causing an influx in buyers, once the momentum and hype drops off, the price drops to reflect a more considered value. A correction would indicate Bitcoin is now "fairly" valued and should be less volatile - not sure we can say that
Bitcoin's price is largely driven by greed and fear. During the bull runs people want in and fear missing out, when the price starts to fall, people fear they will lose everything or want to lock in profits.

You don't quite seem to understand what i am saying. If i have £100 and want a hole. Why would i pay £100 in costs and dig a hole when i could buy two holes on the secondary market for £50ea?
Someone may have invested a lot of money into mining gear, but if the electrical costs are higher than the current price the sunk costs are irrelevant as i would be putting additional wear and tear on mining gear AND losing money per unit mined.

@_date: 2018-06-25 13:49:16
Look into the sunk cost fallacy, you are advocating a text book example of this.
If i wake up one day and Btc is £50 but mining it will cost £100 in electricity alone, there is no logical benefit to me to mine. 
If i have hired equipment which costs me £200 a day i still need to spend £100 in electricity per coin on top of that £200 so assuming i mined only 1 btc that day, it would cost me £300. If i bought 1 btc on that same day, it would only cost me £250.
2 btc mined would cost £400. 2btc bought would effectively cost £300
3 btc mined would cost £500. 3btc bought would effectively cost £350
As you can see, all you are doing in your example is magnifying your losses. The safest thing would be to turn of the equipment and buy btc on the secondary market. 
In reality, people just wouldn't mine. All that is needed is for exchanges to run nodes to verify transactions, and to keep 90% of the transactions on the exchange
Edit: Look into what OPEC does to control the oil price. Some of them genuinely do just stop producing if it goes below costs. Unlike Oil, bitcoin isn't a consumable and can be re-traded reguarly

It already is "MONEY" in a sense. The only issue is that it offers no benefit to the everyday person. Why would your average Joe want a currency which charges them fees, offers no payment or fraud protection and is more complicated than simply swiping a credit card? Banks offer payment protection, savings protection, fraud protection. They will either give me interest on my money, or let me borrow money with ease
Also, you do realize credit cards are part of the fiat system?

"no, wrong" and "the very small mining operations stopped" are contradictory statements... which one is it? 
I don't think they would buy Bitcoin, that was just an example to demonstrate that it was not at all profitable to mine to the extent you may as well buy

Tbh, it's fairly straight forward. The creditors or their representatives requested (over 50% at least) that their claims in the liquidation process be given a monetary value in order to submit a claim. In a liquidation process, the idea is to liquidate assets in order to return the proceeds to the creditors so this makes the most sense. If there are any excess funds after the liquidation, these are split between shareholders. In a case where a company was forced into liquidation it is extremely rare for creditors to be made whole or for the shareholders to receive a penny.
Claims are submitted early on in the process so the monetary value would have been decided on either the date liquidation proceedings began or the date the meeting of creditors convened. 
What has happened here is a very unusual situation. The company was placed into liquidation as they could not fulfill their obligations and debts (at the 2014 value) so they had not option but to admit they were insolvent. If the price had not risen, creditors would have received a fraction of what they were owed, and Mark and other shareholders would receive nothing more. it is only due to the extreme price increases recently that the creditors will break even. The fact the shareholders are due to walk away will so much is an extremely rare situation.
Of course the ideal situation would be to re-apportion the cash value applied to each Bitcoin in the liquidation proceedings based on the amount the bitcoins are actually sold for, but considering the nature of insolvency proceedings, this would be extremely difficult and would cause huge unknowns for the insolvency proceedings and the non bitcoin creditors. it is such a rare occurrence that new legislation will be required before such a thing can happen, although considering the sums involved here, this could very well prompt a new concept for variable assets.

Might use this as the catalyst to sell the next day. It seems everyone and their mums are investing in Bitcoin now, which is great for the short run, but means the momentum will start to slow once there are fewer new buyers. These are also the type of people to panic sell once they lose 10% so a snowball crash could be imminent if it becomes too mainstream.

The "future" just dropped below £8k...today!
In this sort of state, it is only good for speculative betting. To invest is nothing more than a gamble - it may pay off big time, it may end up at $.01. It is meant to be a currency not an asset after all 
It is not at all out of the ordinary (and i am not a noob), i see this sort of thing all the time. Small cap stock sees extraordinary rise base on small volume and a good news statement. People notice this and buy in thinking they have found the next big thing. They hype the fuck out of it during the rise persuading new investors to follow suit and join the hype train. Price rockets, early investors make money and the momentum drives the price higher over the next daya/weeks/months until the FOMO guys are done. Price peaks as no new interest other than existing holders, price falls, quickly. Hype train derails, lots of people lose money but bury their heads in the sand and deny what is happening blaming market manipulation, short attackers, the media, undefined "FUD" or the government.  
The best strategy if you are "invested" is to look at your holding and say "would i bet this much on a coin toss" and take the appropriate action. 
There is no underlying asset. Nothing is price linked to Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not generate value. Bitcoin is a currency. The core purpose of Bitcoin works whether it is $.01 or £1bn. 
I don't really care what the value of bitcoin is. i like the tech but think the media attention and get rich quick kids ruin what it sets out to be.

At least quote market cap, not price per share, so your argument isn't dismissed as completely clueless. There could be multi billion dollar companies with a share price of .53 depending on number of shares in issue.

The title of the thread is "All the bad news you see is all about the old system trying to stop the new one." Indicating the only thing stopping it going mainstream is negative press.
Do you have any idea why banks, governments and our current system exist? We started with a blank state, and this is what was formed through the millennia. We have already seen the impact just a few people had with segwit2x and the fact is that any decentralized system will always become centralized due to human nature's natural urge to consolidate, the same reason we have goliath companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Google etc rather than local stores everywhere.
Fees are a pretty big deal in FIAT already. American express charges a slightly higher fee per transaction in the UK, and a large number of stores refuse to accept it on that basis. Bitcoin currently relies on miners or independent nodes making money from transaction fees as well as the mining, once mining dries out, the fees were designed to incentivize people to continue this service. How do we reach a point where Bitcoin fees are low enough to actually use, but high enough for people to continue their service?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:03:17
Significant fees, long transaction times (not instant), exchanges failing, high profile "hacks", ridiculous daily fluctuations, subject to manipulation, people "hodling" not using, high barriers to entry, complicated to the layman, etc etc
Just some reasons Bitcoin is not the new system.
Once the price is stable (high or low), fees are almost nil (yet somehow enough to incentivize nodes/miners once the mining side is running dry), exchanges manage not to fuck up constantly, and i can use it with the same ease i can use a debit/credit card, then we can talk about the future.
At the moment, it is a speculative asset and does not resemble any sort of new usable system. 
As for the banks, i don't think they are that bothered. If they saw Bitcoin as a realistic future currency, they would be working on how to profit from it before their rivals rather than nay saying. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:24:45
1) That is part of the point, it is not difficult for small sections of society to manipulate this "decentralized" "currency" 
2) Your point was that the fees didn't stop the rise. Like i said, this is because they saw it as an asset, not as a currency. People buying bought because of the upwards momentum and stories of others getting rich quick. High fees kill Bitcoin as a usable daily currency, or as a system, which is the discussion of this thread. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:19:41
What is wrong with holding fiat? It is hedged against my day to day spending and is controlled by the central bank to avoid hyper inflation/deflation. I earn interest, it is insured against banks collapsing, and basically, if i go to bed tonight, i can be pretty certain my spending power tomorrow is the same. I can accurately budget a year in advance knowing prices will not vary too significantly. Pay is in fiat, rent is in fiat, food is in fiat... literally everything i spend money on is valued in fiat. Even if i use bitcoin, the core transaction value is based on fiat.
If i hold Bitcoin, I need to worry each month that my real world spending power could collapse. If i get paid/convert money at the beginning of the month, i may not be able to pay my rent a week later. If my payday happened to be at an all time high and we see a 60% correction, that seriously fucks me over for that month. One day i might have enough to buy a house, but the next when I actually go to exchange, i can't. I need to worry about negative press, foreign policy changes, exchange collapses, hacks, fraud, forks, market manipulation, obsolesce just to name a few. Bitcoin is only ten years old and 90% of the price (probably more) is down to speculative gambling with people trying to get rich quick...

That is a big part of my point. Most people work 9-6 offices jobs (most of which have internet restrictions), have a social life out of work and don't want to do more than half an hours research on new tech. Most will just take what their friends say as fact. Unless a new system is suited to this type of person it can not become main stream and places like coinbase will remain the main point of contact for a lot of people. 
At the moment, if i want to use (note use, not buy/hodl) Bitcoin, i have to jump through some really ridiculous hoops which i do not want to do in order to buy a coffee/snack.
Also, this is a bitcoin subreddit, not fan club. It is healthy to expose yourself to opposing views and discussion without becoming offended and defensive. Something a lot of people on this sub should really learn

Well, you had previously switched to arguing bitcoin was a long term store of value and hence a new system, so i pointed out that 10) bitcoin could not be deemed a long term store of value due to how young it is and 2) that a store of value could not be deemed a new system.
You listing relatively new inventions, (which can be deemed new systems due to the huge take up and everyday usage) indicates that you believe them to somehow prove your point so they too are stores of value. They are undoubtedly new systems, but then think about how many people use these multiple times in their day to day life. If someone doesn't use email (or IM) daily it would be considered strange. Bitcoin is just a fraction of these so completely incomparable. 
Edit: In addition to this, all those systems make life significantly easier, something bitcoin simply can't do at the moment. As per my entire argument from the start

You seem to be missing my point again. I am not trying to explain what determines the share price at all... i am saying that the price of one individual share is a useless indicator of a companies size. 
Again, i am not saying the article is valid. I agree that the company is tiny, but i am pointing out that you gave a very useless figure in support of your point, undermining your entire argument. 
Not sure why you are getting so angsty, but it is clear you didn't know the difference between share price and market cap beforehand, but now you do. There is no reason to try and defend an incorrect position in light of learning something new. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:50:50


1) It hasn't been around long enough to determine this.
2) This thread, and my argument, is that Bitcoin is not any kind of "new system" ready to topple or scare the old. A store of value (like gold) is not enough to constitute a new system of any sort.

Using bitcoin for day to day transactions is like using your tablet as a camera at concerts. Sure the tablet has come pretty cool tech and is the latest tech, but when using it as camera it is clunky and cumbersome compared to a phone, or an actual camera.

Banks do not make money by holding. They make money through loans and interest. They can't loan bitcoin due to the fluctuations.
If Bitcoin was £1k today, and i borrowed 1 bitcoin. What happens if the price doubles tomorrow? I might seriously struggle to pay back the now £2k i owe. At the same time, if bitcoin halves, i would only need to pay back half, and the bank loses out on £500. (If they based the loan on FIAT value, there would be no point anyway)
The investment arms are probably already using Bitcoin, but they usually make most of their money through client fees, so no need for them to hold anything
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:43:46

It is more about the way it has hit 5k, the behavior is very erratic which makes it difficult to envision as a long term sustainable currency or asset.

That store is the perfect example of the key issue with mainstream bitcoin adoption. Even in an online site focused exclusively on promoting Bitcoin, prices are quoted in USD and then converted into bitcoin upon checkout as a payment option based on the current exchange rate.

@_date: 2017-09-22 12:34:57
I think the biggest issue is there no anchor to Bitcoin. USD, EURO or GBP all have an anchor in the fact they are used daily and products are prices specifically for these currencies. ie you walk into a store and no matter what the daily currency fluctuations, the prices are going to be consistent. Since brexit the pound has been much more volatile than usual, but prices have remained fairly consistent. 
Most places that allow you to pay in Bitcoin, anchor their pricing in the natural currency, then adjust to Bitcoin. You could wake up when 1 Bitcoin is worth $4000, but by the time you get to the store, your Bitcoin has dropped 10%, and that will be reflected in the price offered to you in store. The store then has the risk that the price will fall. Until there is some form of anchor, or the price remains constant while maintaining enough interest to remain popular, Bitcoin will continue to be seen as an asset rather than an actual currency.

It is disingenuous to ignore such a large part of Bitcoin for the sake of good PR

Your second point has been covered.
The above is the only thing of value that is added. But saying that, I don't know many people who regularly send money to friends in shithole countries at 3am Sunday morning. For the once a lifetime time i do need to do that, i don't think i would mind paying the £5-£10 it would cost to do a bank transfer (free if they have a UK account)

Exactly my point
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:30:50
2 satoshi?
Can you honestly say this is the norm for someone using a mainstream exchange right now?
It can't be instant. LN is close. Visa isn't instant.
LN is not widely implemented. The layman will simply ask what is LN? Also, how will LN support miners/nodes once the supply is reduced?
Exchanges have always been failing. That's not new.
The fact it is not new should be highly worrying. If my stock broker fails, i am fully protected. What is my Bitcoin exchange fails?
Always had those too.
see above point
People knew this coming in.
And people bought as a speculative asset - they want to make money, not to use as a currency. Not a new system, a new betting tool. I don't want to have enough to buy a new car when i leave a house to get to the store and suddenly not have enough.
 
This doesn't stop people from using USD. Bitcoin was subject to manipulation two months ago also.
USD can't be manipulated into 5% daily swings with a few positive/negative articles
Are you trying to say that hodling makes the price go down? If so, you are an moron.
We are talking about a new "system" not making money in this thread. If most people are holding trying to make money, rather than using, this seriously inhibits any new monetary system and means fewer transactions can have big impacts on price.
 
What is the barrier? How difficult is Coinbase, Cash App, etc?
If you want to use Bitcoin, setting everything up is very tedious. There are also a lot of complainta about coinbase and others taking ages to verify new accounts.
So is the current system. Do you think people understand the system behind credit cards?
Not really, i can open a bank in minutes, my boss pays me in FIAT, my day to day items are prices in FIAT, i am taxed in FIAT. Everything in my day to day life can be taken care of with a debit/credit card in a matter of seconds. Even items you can buy with bitcoin are prices in FIAT and convered
etc etc
There are a hell of a lot more. see other poster
Your comment is juvenile and brings no new knowledge to the table.
Your comment is lacking real world experience using bitcoing and indicates you are in bitcoin to try and get rich not to see it as a new system. As this thread is about seeing bitcoin as a new system and threatening the status quo, a lot of your comments are misguided.

Are they fighting it? In most cases they are asked their opinion and they give it.
Lloyds banning credit card payments is for the same reason you can't buy shares on credit card.

I'm not insulting you/giving you feedback. Your site is designed to take advantage of a phase of bitcoin popularity and momentum in order to profit off the ride. Adding bitcoin payment helps attract bitcoin fanboys so it makes financial sense and helps you to create some easy short term profits selling merch at high margin.
My point is that other than the novelty factor, paying in bitcoin is pointless when every transaction is based on the FIAT value. Once the novelty wears off, there is really no point. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:18:48


Where have i bitched about him taking advantage to profit? He is, but that's business and nothing unusual or wrong with that, i was just highlighting the main reason people add in Bitcoin payments is to take advantage of the wave of fanboys. This feature is to increase profits rather than any practical purpose.
My point is that in a thread encouraging spending of bitcoin, even a site as pro bitcoin as that, is basing their prices on USD and only converting at checkout, demonstrating how pointless day to day use of bitcoin is. It is a novelty feature to pay in bitcoin but the actual benefit to a consumer is negligible.

On the back of the China "news" we saw the price drop from over 5k to around 3.5k in just a few days... if that isn't volatile i don't know what is.

Are services which are used by c. A billion people every single day useless? 
These services are far beyond what bitcoin will ever become.

No i'm not contradicting myself in the slightest. Do you understand what the difference between share price and market cap is? It is possible for a company to have a share price of $10 but be worth a tenth of a company with shares worth $0.10 due to the number of shares in issue. 
Your point that the company is small is correct, but supporting your view with such a flawed argument of an individual share price undermines your position. My post was pointing out that you need to use correct figures.
It would be like me saying my local takeaway shop is a tiny company compared to Mcdonald's because they serve smaller chips. My point is correct, but the reason I gave makes me look clueless.

Stocks and property aren't cool or complicated  
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:35:48
Buying a buy to let property is very easy ( in the UK at least)
Stocks are as simple as going online and picking what you want or a hot fund

Lol, "funds can hold 100% of Bitcoin but that is still literally 0% and meaningless"
Yeah, solid logic mate, really smart, top notch,  at work...

Do you understand the concept of a straw man argument? In a sense that is what you are trying to do 
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:32:03
 just one of many i see very regularly 
There are loads of institutional Bitcoin and cryto funds, in December alone i read dozens of articles about funds being created solely for crypto or adding Bitcoin to certain funds. The fact you believe institutions hold "literally 0%" is insane.

That statement is literally 100% incorrect

But I was talking about just buying a property. You have had to add an element to prove your point. Again calls are not buying stocks.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:51:27
Well no, your point doesn't stand. You have had to extend my argument to include areas not included in my original to try and build an argument

Don't be so salty. This guy clearly fucked up, but it was not malicious. He was caught out of his depth with the meteoric rise in popularity BTC saw. I doubt anyone could have predicted the impact of BTC becoming mainstream overnight. 
What sort of mug puts life destroying amounts into a speculative, largely unknown, intangible, and unregulated "asset" anyway?
Not supporting MtGox at all, but back then Bitcoin was a complete and absolute gamble and people knew the risks. People don't sympathize when a gambler loses money at the track, or on the stock market, so why should people sympathize with people losing money in Bitcoin?

Most people have no idea about something which has hit the front page of every major new paper and had huge prominance in pop culture? Companies were adding blockchain to their name and getting media coverage! People are dumb, but not that dumb.
Bitcoin isn't cool because it has become mainstream and didn't last after the initial momentum. It is niche as a payment option because it sucks as a payment option. As an investment, half my office owns a small amount due to the FOMO attitude the media was pushing. Holding not using 
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:33:15
Noone thinks buying bitcoin is "cool", complicated, or going to make you rich anymore. When you hear a bunch of middle aged men talking about their crypto "investments" you know that image is gone

An ad trying to take advantage of the less informed by promising crazy gains should not be seen as a positive. 
CFD's are insanely risky for those who don't understand them. Read up on the Swiss Frank un-linking, people with relatively small positions ended up losing thousands. in one case a £2 position led to a £5500 loss! Bitcoin would not have the same leverage ratio of course, but losses can still be phenomenal
