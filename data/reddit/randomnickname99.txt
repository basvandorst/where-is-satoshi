80C water seems really aggressive to me.  1st the air would have to exit the miner at at least 80C.  I've never run a miner but does it really come out that hot?  
2nd, the heat capacity of water is far greater than that of air.  So it's going to take a shitload of 80 degree air to make a small amount of 80 degree water.  
3rd though is that heat transfer can be tricky to do in an efficient manner.  The transfer rate is proportional to the difference in temperature.  Coupled with the low thermal conductivity of air you're unlikely to get the water up to 80 without a huge residence time.

You could consider just using it to preheat water which is otherwise heated by another source.  For example lets say you're distilling water to desalinate (although I think reverse osmosis is more commonly used and efficient, but we'll leave that for now).  Normally you have to heat the water all the way from around 20C up to 100C to distill it.  If you use the feed line to cool the miners maybe you can have the feed water enter the column at 30C instead, and save all that energy cost of going from 20 to 30.
Rather than desalinating there's tons of other operations that might make use of this.  I think of my father who has a small maple syrup boiler.  He has to heat the maple sap up to boil off water and concentrate it into syrup, so any pre-warming of the sap would reduce his energy costs.  Unfortunately the whole operation is in the middle of the woods, but you get the point.
