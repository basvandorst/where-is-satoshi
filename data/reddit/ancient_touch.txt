So let's say it took exactly 10 minutes for this block 100 to be created after block 99 was created. How much time it took for the winning miner to find the correct nonce?

Hi, I was wondering exactly what happens in 10 minutes of a block mining? How much time it takes to find correct nonce and things like that

Thanks for clearing it for me. Really appreciate it

My university teacher said it takes 1 second to find the correct nonce always. Remaining time is for propagation and adding block to ledger. 
What got me confused is that he was really sure about that finding the correct nonce takes only 1 second so I was wondering what it does for remaining time.

Thanks for the clarification.

New to Bitcoin. Just joined this sub and have a noobie question.
If blocks are created when transactions are verified and then Bitcoins are rewarded, then how blocks were created in early days? There were no transaction until block 170. How was block 1-169 created?

Thanks. But I wanted to ask that miners solve problem when a transaction is initiated and the first to solve get's to take part in block... That's how it's supposed to be right? I am kinda sure I'm wrong though... So can you lead me to a decent post which actually explains how it works? 
I have read so many posts but I still don't think it clicked with me till now

Blocks can be created without transaction. Ok that's something I was looking for. Thanks
Edit: Just watched the video. It just filled the void in puzzle I was facing. Thanks again

That actually makes sense. Thanks
