I am here to have a discussion/learn more about cryptocurrency. You seem to be here to put others down and be negative.

I'm not sure I understand your point. Buy whichever you think will win? Isn't that essentially what you're doing when you're buying stock in a corporation?

I don't see the harm in asking the Bitcoin community an open ended question about Bitcoin versus other cryptocurrencies. People have the choice to share their insights or not.
None of your responses have been constructive. Again, why are you here?

Nah actually you're just a dick who has provided nothing to this discussion. Probably because you yourself don't know, and it scares you.
Like, have a little self-reflection: I'm asking a worthwhile question and here you are, doing what? Telling me I need to do my own research and that my question isn't constructive? It's called a discussion. It's about producing collaboration and debate. Are you stupid?

You must understand that the majority of the media is controlled by the same powers that control the western central banking system. Bitcoin being a finite, decentralized, transparent system is inherently against the current centralized private banking regime. As such, there are countless articles that cast negativity on Bitcoin, but fail to make any strong arguments. These articles are propaganda at best. It is crucial to read critically during these times.

I have done research. Part of my research is asking this community. Why the negativity?

I was using it as an analogy. And my question, more specifically, is why are you *here*, as in, this post?
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:25:17
But you have the time to post that comment? I don't understand all this negativity in regards to my question. This is a dialogue worth having if you have any considerable holdings in bitcoin.

To buy ripple: Setup an account on Binance. Buy bitcoins on Coinbase, then send to Binance, then buy XRP with Bitcoins on Binance.
I have read that XRP is backed by the current monetary regime/western central bankers and not a true peer to peer system.

What are you here for?
