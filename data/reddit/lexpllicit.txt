GDAX. It's free there.

Documentation? Do you mean a ID or Passport?  Yes you need it to verify your account.

Youre welcome... I am from Germany too and I only can recommend this method because everything is separated and pretty safe. And free.

Make a free N26 bank account. With this you have a Prepaid MasterCard and a normal bank account. From there you can send via SEPA money to coinbase to buy Bitcoins. Or directly pay with MasterCard but the fees are high.

For now you can create a simple paper wallet on bitaddress.org and send the coins to it. But keep the paper safe! When creating the wallet turn of Internet and use encryption. If you use a fresh operating system like Ubuntu it makes it even safer.

Exactly. If the reference number is somewhere in the transaction it should work. Wait a few days and then try to contact support.

Send money to gdax with your bank. Then you can buy Bitcoins with very low fees. Or without fees with limit buys but you have to know what you are doing. Sending Bitcoins from gdax to a wallet is also completely free.

You can insert the phrase here  and recover every address and private key. You also can use a different wallet which is compatible with 12 word phrases.

Did you use the reference number which is linked to your coinbase account in the sepa transaction?

Mycelium Andoid App.. Paper Wallet oder Trezor hardware wallet. 
From GDAX to wallet it is free. From wallet to exchange you have to pay mining fees around 1$ now.

I just sent a tx with 27 sat/byte (about 0,5$) and it is already confirmed. Took about 1,5 hours
