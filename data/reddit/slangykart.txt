Well me, for one. And others like me. We will NEVER let it reach zero, trust me. ��
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:50:47
Yes, to me at $200

I can’t help but wonder if people still exist, that assume bitcoin can only be purchased in whole numbers?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:46:10
I’m hoping it goes even lower, for just that reason!
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:10:50
We joke about it because we have years of experience with this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:12:31
Double-up. If it goes down even more, double-up again!

Hodl. Can someone hodl your hand. ��

To be fair, if they sold at a loss, then they won’t have to pay anything. ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:05:53
So sad. ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:06:46
Yup. Even “if” it takes six months to recover, it will.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:08:24
Pretty low?  I bought at $200. This is nowhere even close to low.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:07:19
That’s the spirit!
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:26:41
Yup. People put too much stock on what other people think. Sad, really. How about finding some TRUE friends, not just users!
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:17:11
By the time you retire, you probably will be able to on that much! ��

As pointed out, the chances of that happening are "stupidly tiny".  I'll go farther and say that the chances are about the same as you sneezing and destroying the entire universe!
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:15:40
Did you contact Bitcoin?  If so, what did Bitcoin say?
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:05:38
Because the method you use to deposit to VirWoX is responsible for KYC, not VirWoX directly.
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:43:15
Yup. Noticed that, too.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:04:04
I'm currently mining cheddar. I think it's gonna go far!
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:26:27
And there you have it, folks.

Your grammar is better than 90% of the native speakers' grammar!
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:34:21
Yeah, because cops are all stupid, right? 
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:57:04
Damnit all to hell and back. I missed it!
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:55:04
Flawed logic. But okay. You are entitled to your opinion.

But the Bitcoin Company's CEO just said that Bitcoin is FINALLY ready for the public!
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:30:00
Hehe. My friends and family know better than to laugh at me. They'd most likely just stay quiet. Nobody commented when I changed my profile picture to a QR code. Two nieces "liked" it, just to be polite!
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:21:46
Let us know how bad it hurts in the morning, please.
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:58:45
Then I'll be had.  I like being had like this!  It suits me just fine!
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:48:54
Hmm.  Ordered coin on Dec 9.  Cleared my bank on Dec 11.  Coinbase shows it clearing my bank on Dec 12, and shows the transaction completed on Dec 13.  I went back and took a screen-shot of the completed transaction when I realized that my balance hasn't been updated, yet.  After reading online postings, I'm guessing that my transaction is going to be rejected.  I'll give them more time, as I wasn't planning to withdraw it immediately, anyway.  But still, I'm confused why they would show "completed" but not update the balance.  *crossing fingers*
Edit:  Apparently their system is just slow sometimes.  Never saw this problem before.  But my balance has been adjusted correctly, now.  Thanks, Coinbase.
