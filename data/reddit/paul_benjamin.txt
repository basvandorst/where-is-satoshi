So should I wait up (It's 23:30 here) or sleep if I want to be awake when you go back online?
The fact that there isn't going to be more than 'a couple of hours' notice for the bell being rung on trading is frankly ridiculous and shows the disdain that traders are being treated with.
Get everything ready, then announce an opening time 12h+ in the future and stick to it...

The claim according to BitGo is that the insurance policy no longer applies (as of January 2016) and that they told all of their customers, I assume in this case BitFinex, who forgot to let us know...

How Finex/Gox et al. are failures of exchanges (or security company or whatever...) not the protocol
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:44:12
Which is utterly insufficient.

If a wallet auto refills a hot wallet, it too is hot. Are you saying a BitFinex employee manually refilled the hot wallet that was being swept?
If there was a 0.5% hotwallet, why were 'my' coins in my 'segregated wallet' swept in one transaction?
I think 'yes we messed up, all coins were in hot wallets, we ignored bitcoin security 101 because it was the easiest way to placate the CTFC' would be a more credible response.

This scares me, it sure sounds like you are saying the only people wearing losses will be those whose nametags were put onto the missing coins by BitFinex staff.
That would be the same as a hotel taking your car at the valet station, parking it unlocked on the street and then shrugging and going 'you should have hedged at another hotel' when it gets stolen.

I'm not disputing this in the slightest, I'm saying what BitGo's line is...
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:06:32
So about those withdrawls?
BFX in high demand... 19c and falling...
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:15:52
We shall see, but I'd mentally place your marker at around 75-80% losses (that's about right if BFX don't chip in anything and only BTC users are paying the price). 
I hope we ultimately do much better than that but it pays to expect the worst right now.

I'm incredibly dubious that Bitfinex holds 8% of all Bitcoin in existence, given the number that have been lost or are verifiably held in cold storage.

"Unfortunately your Bitcoins were stolen while being held by us in our secure segregated wallet. As per our terms of service we hold no liability for these losses but hope that you will continue to be a valued customer here at Bitfinex the world's largest and most secure exchange.
If you have any questioms please contact support who will cut and paste a reply"

It's better than it not being there, that's for sure...
Does the address start with a 3? That's also a good sign.
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:06:35
I'd say it'll be closer to 70% losses, maybe more.

That isn't how stop losses work.
A stop loss triggers a market sell, it will execute at the highest available bid
Now imagine there are a ton of these triggering all at once, onto a book with very few bids. People's stops set at 700 would have been filled at below 640 which I get the feeling would have caused even more anguish than the current plan.

BFX support has been good, they've responded to my questions promptly. 
I can't say I've been thrilled by some of the answers, but slamming the support guys is unfair.
The last update I got was that they think the problem is fixed, but they are testing before trying to resume trading. The timescale for resumption is probably within the next couple of hours.
