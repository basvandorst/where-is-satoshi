This technology is severely flawed and highly centralized which is anathema to blockchain principles. They've tried to deploy it in countries where governments are technologically impotent, and the test case in Cameroon is their latest victim. Their code is not open source and has not undergone a standard crypto currency audit by the community. They have also dodged a lot of questions asked by the crypto community in terms of transparency and accountability. Their main base of operations is in India, but the foundation is based in Toronto headed by a guy called Kunal Dixit -it is a private centralized blockchain - doesn't make sense. Stay away

You are correct, it will take time. I think the "big guys" of today will join ultimately for lack of options. Not joining today seems obvious, heck castigating it is a-la-mode. But a bitcoin parallel economy is slowly developing. It will thrive, but it will take time. The current system will fail ultimately, but at that point, the bitcoin economy will be waiting, more mature and robust than ever, having weathered the storms and wars thrown at it. It'll be obvious.

Remains to be defined, but it starts here I guess. I know there has been several votes on how we want to call this unit, and it seems the "bits" have almost always carried the day. I personally do not mind bits, but some of those who don't like it hate it with such vitriol. So I am not sure if "concensus" if simply sampling these opinions again. Another Idea that seems to be gaining traction is a 1:1000,000 "stock split" of bitcoin, thus reassigning the name bitcoin instead of bits. It is not clear what it will entail to pull this through. My concern with this is moving from 21 million to 21 trillion bitcoins, even though it is the exact same amount.

1 XBT = 100 satoshis is the way to go. - accounting units - easy of conversion - mainstream adoption - future resilient No need to add bits on the application (though I don't mind the name). Debate should focus on what an XBT represents.
It might not be a big deal for some who use the big currencies like dollars, pounds and euros, but most of the rest of the world have much weaker currencies. 1 btc = 31,000 Kenyan shillings 1 btc = 60,000 Nigerian Niaras 1 btc = 180,000 central African XAF. For the unbanked of the rest of the world we are hoping would adopt bitcoin first, these are scary numbers already. I am happy there is at least some debate on this within the foundation. I hope some are thinking about the vast majority who can't shout on reddit.

I think 1 satoshi will be equal or near 1 cent in dollars once there is mass adoption of bitcoin. This would make 1XBT = 1USD. At such a point, things will be referenced in XBT and other currencies would likely to hyperinflatting to a constant bitcoin. I would not see a need to change change the decimal places any more in the future.

I might be wrong, but I can't imagine a time in the history of this our world when the greatest and willing minds have been able to collude so extensively for good, making a ground working technology work even better, by their free will, as well as their greed (not derogatory). With instant communication and information analysis through the likes of twitter, r/bitcoin and other forums. 
Slowly it matures, suddenly critics become affraid - very affraid, surely it succeeds. Its just a matter of time; 
and freedom will reign; Then we'll realize mandkin can actually survive without boundries, or wars. 
That the worlds' tallents can actually be levereged for good and not wasted on dubious bureaucracy and middle men scams. This is the beginning of the end.

Kitiwa, a bitcoin start up in Ghana, is allowing Ghanians buy bitcoins with their local currency, the Cedis. They developed a revolutionary payment system called Mpower, that permits this to take place online as well, since Visa, paypal and the others block most online transactions originating from developing countries. 
Now merchants and individuals are able to bye domain names (namecheap.com), promote their businesses online and receive payments in bitcoins, shop online - including on Amazon (through gyft), make hotel reservations, get flight tickets online, ... things the rest of the world take for granted. 
Kitiwa.com will start buying bitcoins for cedis after next weeks demo event, thereby closing the loop needed for a full remittance service.  
Remittance is supposedly the first disruptive wave from the bitcoin technology. Yet it's been hard to take off, mostly due to the local realities of the destination countries. 
Africa is an emerging market with a vastly untapped potential. Liberating Africa by allowing it fair access to the rest of the world economy is the promise of bitcoin in our minds.
We are looking at developing similar startups in central africa.

This possible confusion is well worth considering. And I agree, changing the meaning of bitcoin can even be dangerous. 
Honestly we are even debating this possibility because some people in the minority just don't like "bits". The only way this is going to move forward is by majority rule. Countless pools over the last years show most people want bits. As someone said earlier, we can't spend the next 5 years going around the same thing and ignoring  the concensus. Bits it is.

@_date: 2014-10-29 05:08:07
Plan A absolutely. 
Though would prefer 1XBT = 100 Satoshis. 
With more adoption, 99% of things would cost less than a full bitcoin. We'll be stuck with using long decimal numbers "forever" until we change that midway and cause more confusion.  
Most currencies are much weaker than the dollar, so the issue is magnified several times over when we try to consider most of those we are hoping bitcoins will help the most.

I read somewhere this might become the new Bitcoin from the next halving in 2 years. Not sure how it will be done; a 1:1000,000 split or just a name change. Would be great either way.

@_date: 2014-09-25 01:20:44
I suppose after such a 1:1000,000 split the new unit will still be called bitcoin. Thus maintaining the name and doing away with all the confusing appellations and decimals. This is really a brilliant idea. If it can be done, then I hope this really garners support within the dev community for implementation at the next halving.

@_date: 2014-09-25 01:35:46
I have been following this debate peripherally for a while now, and by far the best option is 1:1,000,000 split. 
So instead of "bits", "ubits", "microbits" or some other name that will soon crop up, call the new unit bitcoin. 
This keeps the conventional currency 2 decimal places, as well as maintains our beloved bitcoin name. If a true split can't be done technically, then a simple name change night accomplish this.

"The working group will deploy a consensus based process for reaching an agreement for the official currency symbol. In addition, the working group will recommend Bitcoin subunits. In a currency, there is usually a main unit (base), and a subunit that is a fraction of the main unit. Currencies today operate with two decimal spaces to the right ($1.00). In Bitcoin, there are currently eight so one could theoretically pay you 0.00000001 or one hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin. Not only is this confusing for consumers, it does not fit in existing systems and software for accounting practices"

A better explanation for brainwallet is generating an appropriate hash of a strong password using a dedicated device that you do not plan to connect to the internet.

It's a virtual foldapp card on your phone when you sign on. You choose a pre-selected amount like $10, but the you pay 20% less with bitcoin for that credit.

This from cointelegraph article on this. Why cash only? Is this anonymous to conceal possible government buy to dump at a later date when things are looking like take-off time? food for thought.

Will checkout Transferwise. Makes me think of previous rip-offs with westernunion. Thanks.

Thanks much. Only learned about this today. From their site "--matches you with people sending in the other direction--". Does this make the time to complete the transaction unpredictable?

Great compilation. Been following the work on THEWEALTHOFCHIPS- Keep up the strong work if that was you. 
Was this the first mention of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-03 01:28:17
At least it is you bro.
@_date: 2015-10-03 12:47:41

@_date: 2015-10-03 03:09:28

I created a second circle account a week or 2 ago to see if transferring in usd will arrive as usd, the other account received btc instead. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 17:02:36
Very well said my friend
@_date: 2015-10-03 01:25:59
Those are the huddles for now I was referring to. I think things will only improve as usd (fiat) wallets on coinbase and others become more universal. BTW when I sell my btc on coinbase, I get fiat in my account in 1-2 business days not 7.

They only use their rates; have no idea how they come up with them.
@_date: 2015-03-11 23:56:44
Any proof you are the real satoshi?
@_date: 2015-10-03 01:27:23
Thanks for reading. was too pissed. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 01:44:57
I tried foldapp earlier today and discovered the discount is at the point of crediting ones card with usd from bitcoin. Really cool.

Are your guys at ps still working on btc integration? The story has kind of quietened a little. Raising awareness has done wonders for other poker communities anyways :).

He who doesn't recognize genius is not that smart! The fascination is obviously with it's simplicity. Putting all the complex pieces together to come up with such a seamless flow is simply a marvel. But off course hindsight is 20/20
And yes, it takes a genius to figure this one out.
