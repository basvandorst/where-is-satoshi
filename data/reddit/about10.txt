Great reply &amp; great read.
I completely agree with you that we are subjected to same type of scams as we are in real life (pyramid schemes, false exchanges, fake tokens/coins,scam icos). However at the end of the day if enough people are willing to pay market value for any coins (and not just a few bucks but billions of dollars) then there is an already established market.
It's kind of refreshing to see so much transparency and ease of identifying pyramid schemes. Based on my research NEO has though a lot about how GAS is generated and it's quite a facinating read (google neo gas as I don't want to post any links).
Do I believe in BTC? Yes and it will go up a lot this year.
Do I believe in Altcoins? I think of altcoins as "apps" for BTC. 
- You need a secure/decentralized exchange? There are "apps/coins" for that.
- You don't want to pay fees at all? Got you covered
- Need tax remittances so your charity can have a coin? Sure there are coins for that as well.
As you can see altcoins are just new "apps" and while your phone/BTC is great you can get a bunch of "apps/coins" that make your life easier.
Thanks for the reply!

Any coin is simply a "belief of value"  as in there are some people in the world that believe a virtual coin is currently worth something. BTC itself is not the true "master" currency. 
BTC current market value = somewhere out there is willing to pay current price for it.
Any Altcoin current market value = somewhere out there is willing to pay current price for it.
Some Altcoins are cooler than BTC because they give you 5-10% passive income. Some people believe in this and are willing to pay $100 per coin to get $5 per year. I am one of those people.

So would it ever go sub 1? Or is 1 the min?
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:10:40
I am sure in the future there will be a coin that: 
- no transaction fee
- decentralized
- instant
- POS (like NEO)
- anonymous
- built in dex like waves
- turing smart contracts

You mean the 10 year open source battle tested software that processed billions of dollars? Might as well not trust internet then because who knows what your ISPs are up to.

First of all there are tons of altcoins that have real value.
NEO - gain passive income and $0 transaction fees.
Waves - fastest decentralized exchange in the world.
Sorry but you aren't going to a store and buy bread for .000002 BTC. There are better and more specialized ways of handling scenarios.

$2700 rent for 2 bedroom in downtown Toronto. 680 sq feet
 Rip.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:00:46
There only needs to be 2 coins: Bitcoin and Garlicoin.
Everything else can go.

First it was the coal mines. Now it's the asic/gpu mines. Wait until environmentalists hear about his.

@_date: 2018-02-27 16:13:27
Well it's an asic-resistant fork of litecoin. So I guess that counts.

Yeah but a fat chance that we would qualify for a 850k mortgage necessary to buy a place like this.
Even 1 bedroom would be north of 550k which would be too small for 3 people.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:02:20
Miners will only buy what has highest ROI. That's why they aren't buying $4k Titan V's because ROI is like 3 years.

I got 1000 Garlic coins. When do you want to do this?
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:40:29
I think so too. 69 million coins for 10 billlion people.

Let me send you over a smart contract really quick.

Of course not... It was just a joke.

I've been mining bitcoin on my GTX 480 since March, 2010. Still going strong...
Anything better nowdays?
