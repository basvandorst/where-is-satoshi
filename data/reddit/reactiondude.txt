Can anyone shed some light on rules of engagement / etiquette for localbitcoins and how to protect oneself from possible scams.

If you have the time, would you be willing to share how the interaction went down?  This is all new to me as I've only been around bitcoin for a week.  Thanks in advance for any info.

I went to bitcion.org to downloade the new 0.8.2 patch but it still has 0.8.1 bitcoin-qt client.  Where's the safe place to download the new 0.8.2 client?

Mediafire.com or depositfiles.com works.  I have ubuntu on VMware.  Thanks again dude.

Stuff like this scares the crap out of me.  I'm looking to convert a large sum of money through bitinstant as well.

Did you guys each bring a laptop or was it done on your smartphones?  Thanks again for the I sight.

We are seeing history in the making, my friend.

You can be apart of a group buy, in the forums.

Sad to see when people buy just to resell an awesome product.

Hey bud,
I was reading about paper wallets that, when withdrawn, should be withdrawn completely.  Is this the same with the armory offline wallet, or am I able to make small transactions?

Can I have both the tar.gz and the walk through?  I ask for both because I also want to learn the process.  I'm also posting so I can tip you in the future for taking the extra step to help me out.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:09:30
Yeah, from the US.  What would be the next step after Dwolla?  Mt Gox?
I've seen a vid of a guy having his BTCs frozen for over 2 weeks when he tried to cash out.

**Posting this in the event you cant access the page**
The Block Erupter USB series is the second major product of Bitfountain. Its experimental batch (Emerald) has passed all tests. Each one mines at more than 300MH/s, powered only by the USB port.
It serves as a replacement of GPUs for mining hobbyists. Your GPUs could be freed from calculating hashes and resume rendering for you. It is also a perfect gift for getting people knowing about Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining.
The Emerald Batch
This is our experimental batch, and consists only a few number of devices. One of the photos is here:
Color: Green
Hashrate: &gt;300MH/s
Mining Protocol: Icarus
This batch will be given away to miners, fans and hardware/software developers made the assignments to us long before. It has some issues working with cgminer, but the modular python miner works fine. We will fix this in the first mass production batch (Sapphire). It also exceeds a bit of the USB spec of max current (560mA vs &lt;500mA), but in our experiment most devices (PC, laptop) could power it up.
The Sapphire Batch
This is the first batch under production in quantity. Its lead-time is conservatively 15-20 days.
Changes and Improvements
Color of PCB changed to blue
Adding a LED which blinks when a share is found
Fixing the cgminer compatibility problem
Reducing the heat generated and the current to &lt;500mA
This batch will be for group-buy and retailers. The quantity of each order should be more than 300 devices. The price is fixed at 1.99 BTC. We will start the group-buy threads as fixed-price auctions in the auction subforum. When your order is fulfilled you could pay and ask for refund anytime before the tracking number is generated (trackable on internet). After shipping we do not refund, but still guarantee a six-month warranty of free replacement like our blades. However the replacement should also come in batch (10 at one time).
Interested purchasers could contact me even before the group-buy threads are created.
