Make sure you are creating a new seed. Don't put your coins on a ledger where the 24word seed is already created.

I plan on building an open air tire incinerator to power my miners.

What blithering nonsense are you spewing?
Did you even read what you wrote?
"If you purchase a car for 20k, and a few months after the purchase its KBB value is 10k, when you go to trade in at a dealer they won't base their trade in value off of what your purchased it for. Its based on the CURRENT VALUE of the asset."
Yeah exactly. You only accept a loss when / if you SELL. If you never sell you still hold the asset you purchased i.e. the car.

You can put as much or little as you want for the transaction fee. Current market price sat/b decides how quick it will be confirmed, or at all.

You're delusional. BTC is currently down 21% bcash down 30.7%
Is that what your Ver cult wants? I'm happy holding both coins. Unlike you. Enjoy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:07:20
Ver is still a douche though...

I believe assets held less than a year would fall under earned income tax rather than capital gains.
What you end up doing is obviously up to you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:31:41
Do you have enough to cover the transaction fee as well?
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:11:09
What a strange time, just last month everyone was wondering if BTC would hit 10k by the end of the year. Now everyone is freaking out that it's 'fallen' to 16k.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:35:48
Seems like you created a new BTC address, your BCH should still be on the BCH blockchain under your original imported BTC address.
It's kinda odd that it's still not in your dashboard, make sure under bitcoin cash you are checking under imported addresses. I'm pretty sure blockchain.info split BTC and BCH  wallets for their users.

They halted trading because there was a swing in the price over a certain percentage.

Hodl the bitchain blockcoins

So he is a dogecoin? Ok I'll see myself out now..
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:42:54
Then go invest in crypto kitties and cry yourself to sleep.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:28:48
HODL isn't just a meme it's practically mandatory at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:06:39
Being a bit sensational? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:54:19
That would never confirm and get dropped eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:35:41
Correct you would send to the same address with a higher fee. If it works or not depends on the block chain.info wallet if they mark their transactions as replace by fee (rbf) you can  double spend and the new transaction with the higher fee should get confirmed and the old one not.
Otherwise the only other option is to wait.
Edit. If blockchain.info won't allow a rbf. I suppose you could export the private key and import it to a wallet that does.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:13:51
You only lose when you sell. Last month everyone was shouting how we will hit 10k by the end of the year. Now we hit 20k and are back at 13k and the sky is falling. Lol

Derivatives are not sound money regardless of the market. Nothing new here.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:25:38
Could try to resend with a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:56:51
Well current fee is about 660 Satoshi / byte. If your transaction size is rather large, then that will eat up the entire  balance.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:31
It's like a series of tubes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:59:24
Yes, while it can hold about 5 apps at once you can delete the app and not lose the coins in that wallet.

Use your big beautiful tax cut to buy crypto and MAGA

I suggest reading up on the user guides in the meantime.
Think of it perhaps like this, you install a bunch of games on your PC. You run out of room and want to install a new game. You uninstall something, but you still have access to your save data so you don't lose anything.

So you used a system that is meant to free people from central banking just as a means to profit.
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:17:33
You might be missing my point, fraudulent derivatives and QE give the perception of a strong stable dollar, there is nothing stable about it. Banks were bailed out that made bad bets just for the sake of profit , they were bailed out else the entire Keynesian system would collapse. You remember what happened in 2008? The original point the op was making is that bitcoin is volatile, I was just simply trying to make a point that the only thing that gives the dollar a sense of stability is manipulation and pointed to a few examples of said manipulation. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 06:48:57
The only thing keeping the dollar "stable" is mass manipulation, endless quantitative easing , derivatives, petro dollar, endless war etc.. Bitcoin frees humanity from all of this, IMO the main reason bitcoin is so volitale is people treating bitcoin like an investment or stock option. 
When I inform people of bitcoin and they ask me why they should use bitcoin, I simply ask them if they support endless war, any conscious sane person obviously says no, then I say that is reason enough to stop using the dollar.
@_date: 2015-01-06 21:20:57
So where's your "better argument", oh that's right you don't have one oh majestic keyboard warrior. Btw I'm not libertarian. Your the only one spewing mindless dribble, sorry facts get in the way of whatever point you were trying to make.. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 21:37:56
Oh look another keyboard warrior who brings nothing to the discussion. So your telling me that your in favor of credit default swaps (among other frauduelent derivatives), and the masses of cheap money being printed to prop up the stock market to give the perception of a strong stable dollar? Well I would try to have an actual conversation with you, but your clearly not here for that.

The 1.00 charge might just be a deposit / withdrawal to make sure it's a valid account. There should be 2 more transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:52:17
Centralized mining and someone / group controlling 51% or more of the network hashing power.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:02:28
I've heard of banks lumping verification charges together, so 2 charges of .08 and .11 would show up as .19. You would have to call the bank to see if that's the case. Otherwise remove the account and try it again ..

Hindsight so on and so on. They got a return which is obviously why they sold. Bitcoin pizza guy on the other hand...
I bought 3 shirts for 1 bitcoin each when it was 20$. While no where near the same amount at least I have more to show for it than bitcoin pizza guy.

I saw an gpu bitcoin mining comparison article in july 2011 on hardocp. Embarrassingly I must admit I didn't actually read the article proper and glanced over it thinking it was some new gpu benchmark.. 2 months later I saw the error in my ways and started mining.

Congratulations on trading your government issued fiat currency for something worthwhile.
Now stop looking at how it converts back into fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:17:18
Yeah that's kinda the point I was trying to make. Could have worded it better.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:34:46
You must be the same person claiming they maxxed out their credit buying at 18.5k
