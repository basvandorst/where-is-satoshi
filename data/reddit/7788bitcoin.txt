Is the puzzle closed now? Seems like people has been creating wrong clues and destroying the original clues....
@_date: 2016-08-08 06:46:26
Maybe in the next version of passphrase.io, you can consider having a "read-only" passphrase, and a R/W passphrase of the same notepad. 
This will stop people from editing without permission...

Also just started getting some... My target is 2.1 BTC... 1 in 10 millions...

Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2014-08-17 11:07:31
Thanks for your advice. Just curious- if I were to use coinbase to sweep the private key, how would another person retrieve the private key I used, unless my computer or network is compromised? Is there other way other people can do that?
@_date: 2014-07-14 07:32:57
Thanks for the 1,000 bits!
@_date: 2014-09-16 01:21:39
Just realised a tip from you. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-11-04 06:16:24
Nice humor! 100 bits @_date: 2014-08-19 15:56:43
Good job! Guess Coinbase is always careful about the transfer process. Maybe I will be lucky next time. Did you use coinbase as well?
@_date: 2014-11-19 05:35:01
I think **IF** everyone thinks 1 BTC = $1,000,000, then it is. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 06:12:51
count me in, please!
My address is 1FJDX4u6BD2no2W2ubrNDBm2rTmcvvPZTp.
Amazingly easy to use and fast download. My concern is the security because I do not know how the default address was generated. How can I extract out the private key? Does anyone else know and hold the private key? Maybe my concern is unfounded. I will still use the app but maybe just keep small amount ($20-30) in the wallet.
People in this forum has provided good suggestion. I have one as well. Maybe we can also add a message to the bitcoin sent, just like the ones seen in blockchain. This can help to identify the purpose of the transaction. Hope this make sense.
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:36:14
I am interested! How do I get some? Who is "changetip"? 
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:08:57
The chance of finding one will be very very very very (x100) slim- or else why are we here??
Maybe blockchain will treat your requests as DDoS attacks and will soon block your IP address....
@_date: 2014-10-16 12:54:34
This is really creative! 
Remember I used to play the Heroes of Might and Magic and finding treasures floating on the sea! Bitcoins are the "treasure" of the future!
Great job!

New member reporting! Just joined yesterday. Already got a friendly tip from a member! Can't wait to learn more about bitcoin. This is exciting!
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:31:53
This was fast! Tried your username and it happened to be the passphrase- but it was gone. Too slow...
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:50:05
I think my account was not linked when the tip was sent. Never mind then. Thanks anyway.
@_date: 2014-11-04 06:18:07
I think tipping can encourage more people to be active in the community! Just tipped a nice humor!
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:23:51
Great one but one issue: The outcome maybe wrong!
I put in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" in, but the outcome is totally different from the one obtained from bitaddress.org 
Maybe the math used is different?? 
@_date: 2014-10-19 16:23:18
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:13:38
I think I got it but not sure.
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:27:17
I only have about 0.32 BTC now (bought some and spent some)... Maybe just to buy myself a some house?
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:19:42
How many candles do you need? :p
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:36:40
Just because he spent 1 million on tipping us!
@_date: 2014-07-14 06:53:48
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:26:08
Too early... 
@_date: 2014-07-09 02:39:33
Hmmm... apologies perhaps I am just stupid... tried to link changetip to my login but it doesn't seems to receive anything...
@_date: 2014-09-10 05:01:05
I think buying bitcoins directly is cheap enough now. Forget about (cloud) mining.
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:13:14
Another generous gentleman! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-14 08:09:30
Sigh... I only have less than half a coin and won't be able to help the price swing. I guess I just have to hold on tight!!! To the .... earth? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:59:53
Yohoho! Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:14:47
Balance just in. Thanks!

I am always late! Took 1 minute to figure out but the wallet has already gone empty!
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:10:00
that's a good one.
@_date: 2014-09-11 03:41:37
blanket12334 gave part of the private key- with the "5" missing and the whole key re-written backwards.
1CUkrHTRc8NTaQzdfHSTUPJdTnA7tfxUjA is the public key.
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:11:05
Nope... Not working. If don't mind will you sent just 1 bit for me to try. Sorry I am a noob.
@_date: 2014-12-03 09:01:53
I was with the pool for about several months. Great pool and no downtime at all!
Unfortunately I was unable to keep up with the difficulty and stop mining since May.

Where are the clues?
@_date: 2014-08-10 07:34:05
Unfortunately the service is not free... Fee ranges from 4 bits to 1000 bits (from $0.024 to $0.6) per transfer. Mobile service provider also often charge by per SMS. These fees maybe small to us but can be a huge burden to others. Also, you may not find a gateway in most countries.
@_date: 2014-10-13 08:16:27
I think many here are afraid of the early miners dumping huge amount of BTC into the market suddenly and crush the price.
However, in the long run, it is actually good to have these coins redistributed- the influence of early miners will get diluted and we should have a stronger "economy". 
Just my naive thoughts. 
Everyone should spend BTC and not just HODLing them.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:13:18
Additional links you may consider: Winkdex, Microwallet, Free BTC faucet list (eg. land of bitcoin). Will look at the site carefully again tomorrow. Sleepy eyes now.

iWallet is coming on 9th September. I think this will cause some people to worry and dump their coins. However, I guess the price will stay around $500 for the next few weeks.

Maybe people can also think of creative ways of "burning their bitcoins. 
An example is this guy who "released" his bitcoins into the oceans...
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:56:15
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:22:55
Hurray! Thanks a lot....Ha... Can I tip you back the 0.799mBTC? I will find out how and try that later.... This is fun.
@_date: 2014-08-25 08:48:22
Maybe you can try playing with the faucets? Land of Bitcoins is a good starting point. I guess you just need to exchange something for bitcoins- time or money.
@_date: 2014-10-19 16:19:20

If half of the miners pull their plugs, then the other half will be getting double the rewards...
Who do you think will take the action first? I guess everyone is waiting for others...

I did solve one of them but I can't seem to get the right public key (I think it was  phrase = A BLAST FROM THE PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE + random block).
Could you please let me know the answer so that we know what is expected?

[Bread for the City]( They have started accepting bitcoin donation but the page is not obvious from their website.
Their [bitcoin donation page]( via BitPay. 
Not sure if they have any Changetip account or not.

Apologies I do not know that complex maths behind this.
Are the paper wallets generated by bitaddress.org (offline) safe? Or the ones generated by some online wallets (such as Coinbase, Blockchain safe?)

I am interested to help. Please count me in!
@_date: 2017-04-17 01:38:29
Huh? We need to pay you first and then help you crack the password?? Maybe you can allow free download so that we can help?
This is a Red flag I guess...
@_date: 2017-04-17 01:48:13
You are right about the value increase but 100 BTC will still be 100 BTC after n x 4 years! It will not increase to 200 BTC after every halving.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:38:04
You might need to purchase a little bit more. Transferring 1.000007 BTC out of Coinbase will make it a little less than 1BTC, due to the fee...

Just my wild imagination: If you have lots of BTC in the mSATA, you can buy another working mSATA of the same model (new or used), *move*/transplant the memory chips on the spoilt one to the working one. Then you may be able to extract the data out.
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:56:28
A few small "Changetip"
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:00:17
I will try connecting the mSATA as a slave in another computer and boot up.  If the mSATA can be found, try to do a "chkdsk" or fix errors using disk checking utilities.
