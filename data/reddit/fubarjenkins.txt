Hahaha “...our collective nards”  
Thanks for the laugh.
Yes I can attest, I first bought in beginning of September and accumulated for the past 3 months, my highest buy was at 17k
As of this writing my total portfolio is up 250%
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:30:44
Please enlighten me.  
Funds were returned in the form of BCC, as far as I know, that is a functioning, mineable, cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for bitcoin.  Granted, the usd value of BCC took a shit for obvious reasons, but does not change the fact that it’s a tradable coin.  
What am I missing?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:25:23
It’s not quite a scam when they return everyone’s money dude
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:03:21
I got a good lol out of this.  Come on everyone HODL! BUY THE DIP!  Hahaha
Ps. I spy Angel stadium
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:02:27
The first cboe futures contracts strike tomorrow.  Methinks it has something to do with that
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:00:13
BCC can gain value just the same as it can lose value.  Kind of like Bitcoin.  It’s a mineable cryptocurrency.  How do I not understand how BCC works?
Would you not agree that 90% loss is only realized if you sell?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:51:28
You need to do a little better research before you post shit like this.  Bitconnect returned everyone’s money. They didn’t “run off with $4 billion”.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:19:48
What’s your deal man?  Now you’re just rambling
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:00:50
Whats it mean?
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:15:41
You’re right, but the guys holding futures contracts will do their best to control the btc price by directly buying/selling btc in order to hit their futures contract price
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:52:08
Hahaha shit that’s funny!  
....Tron...rofl ��
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:21:05
You’re a shithead. I didn’t have money in bitconnect, just observing what was going on with it.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:53:15
I’m laughing so hard at that one
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:31:18
Holy shit you’re an idiot.  I’m not sticking up for anyone, your post contains false information and I’m correcting you
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:36:55
Lol so lame! But you have my upvote cause im into dad jokes
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:25:54
darn kids and their mining for buttcorn
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:11:34
Im sure you’re right, but what i’m suggesting is that bitcoin hasn’t seen the amount of money that CME will bring to the table.  The shorts on Bitmex in the past are small fries compared to whats coming
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:09:06
It’s not a currency. It’s an asset.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:34:21
Hahaha fucking retarded
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:40:21
This just made me lolz
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:53:59
Hhaha wtf was that?!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:18:55
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:30:47
Its starting to piss me off honestly.  Bitcoin needs to calm it’s happy pants down.  I mean, my money is growing and im excited, but geez take a chill pill btc
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:06:01
I think you need an adult to sign off for you
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:07:21
Lol good luck with that
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:48
Tight.  I barely understood what you just said but im into it
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:50:01
How much of the really big money has been shorting bitcoin in the past though?  I’m guessing not nearly the amount that CME/CBOE will be..
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:56:36
It’s a long way back to 4k...
Honestly not trying to be a dick, but how are you feeling about your prediction at this point?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:08
Thats a long walk
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:59:52
You can opt-in replay protection, but I’m not going to try and explain how to do it.
Honestly, if you are even the slightest bit unsure of what you are doing, I wouldn’t even f*ck around with it.  Just hold your coins, hold your private key, and wait for some more certainty and solid answers to what is going on.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:07:34
You’re pure fiat now...why would you want to make a bet in btc?
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:19:09
Yep.  A lot of people plan to sell S2x coins after the fork, they are betting that S2x will not gain enough support to survive.  Nobody knows for sure yet which chain will win out
But, by selling your S2x coin you are ultimately showing your support for the original chain.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:22:25
Beautiful painting!  How much bitcoin is it selling for?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:14:13
*First off, I want to be clear that i’m not an expert, I encourage everyone here to keep reading and learning from all different resources!!
Regarding replay protection:  what it does is ensure that transactions on one chain(S2x) are not duplicated on the other chain(btc).  For example: if replay protection is NOT in place after the fork and I sell 5 S2x coins, there is a chance that 5 btc coins will also be “sold”,  I will lose 5 of each coin i’m holding but will only receive compensation for the 5 S2x coins.  
When replay protection is in place, you are able to sell coins from one chain without any effect on the other chain.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:35:45
Exactly.  It’s not as big of a gamble to do it that way, so you’re not going to make as much money, but in my opinion it’s a wiser decision.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:36:57
Well...S2x is basically made to be an attack on Btc.  They want to be the dominant chain, they want Btc to fail; not having strong replay protection in place helps their cause.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:50:58
Ok here’s a question about betting terms:  what if bitcoin takes this nose dive below 4k in December, then climbs back above 4k by Jan. 1st?
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:10:41
Thank you!  I’m new to reddit, but all I’ve seen for the past two weeks on here is: “I don’t want to put in the time to understand what I’m throwing my money at, can someone just hold my hand and reaffirm my hopes that I’ll make a bunch of money?”
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:18:54
You’re right.  
But ultimately the chain that survives depends on the support it has from miners and users.
As of right now, the general feeling I’m getting is that the original chain is most supported and will survive in the long-run
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:29:37
Then why not just buy .1 btc in Jan when it’s below 4k ?!
I understand you’re aim is to wake people up to the volatility of bitcoin and its seedy underworld, but this bet thing you’re trying to do seems like the wrong way to go about doing a good deed
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:38:04
I semi-appreciate what you’re trying to do.
I’ll watch the bets play out from the sidelines
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:20:05
So you lose either way??  You buy btc now @ $8600 to make the bet, price doesn’t drop on Jan 1 and you lose your .05btc.
Price drops below 4k on Jan 1 and you win the bet but are now holding .10btc that is worth less than half the price you bought at and dropping...
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:48:53
All this hype and money being dumped into btc with no understanding, these are the people who will flip out at a small dip in price, who will sell everything at the drop of a hat, who will cause panic in the market and bubbles to pop.
No worries for those people who have some understanding and believe in the technology, we’ll keep our stance firm and accept any potential losses because we’ve mentally and financially prepared for it.
And you’re right, it is insignificant, bitcoin will be fine.
But like OP said, it’s frightening to think about the people who make hasty decisions, who throw everything they have into btc and then panic sell because they’re not millionaires right away like they were led to believe from all the hype posts on reddit.  It’s a gambler’s mentality.  These people get f*cked.  These are the same type of people that got f*cked in the housing crisis, that got f*cked in the dotcom bubble.  I feel bad for them.  
Do some research.  It’s better for everyone if we all understand this golden ticket we’re holding.
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:29:44
you’re selling on a dip.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:17:01
Go Dodgers!  And go Bitcoin!
