The gold market is huge, many trillions worth of it out there.  by comparison, Greece is very small, total value of all their debt is ~$200 billion, so I'm not suprised there's little to no correlation.  Bitcoin is small, all of them in total are worth about $4B... so an extra $100 M in demand can have a huge impact on btc, but wouldn't even be felt by the gold market.

you can choose to listen or not to any petition - when people vote with their dollars, and use overstock, you take the choice away from amazon, and force them to adapt.

OK - in that case, the bitcoins aren't being replenished, and spending $1 in bitcoins acts as a $1 sale - with no new demand and supply increasing, the value of bitcoins will decrease, unless new investors are brought to market.
and - you still have to face the fact that the US government has given no clear indication of what their stance on bitcoins will be.  the potential upside of $13M in profit could be VERY quickly eaten up by potential legal fees.
Amazon will not accept bitcoins based on some petition, they'll accept them when they fear companies like overstock.com gain a real competitive advantage over them due to bitcoin sales.
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:03:50
"likely not get in any scale to justify it" - this, exactly.  the vast majority of the 12 million bitcoins in existence are owned by a few people, add on top of that, most of the 10 billion dollars invested in bitcoin are just that - invested - with the speculative hope that their value will increase.  at *MOST* there is currently $2 billion worth of bitcoins willing to be "spent and replenished" - and that's being generous.
Add to that information - Amazon's 2013 revenue is expected to be ~75 billion in USD.  oh, and their profit off those sales is very small, only expected to be $1 billion for the year.
Let's say you're Jeff Bezos.  the Maximum upside of bitcoin sales in 2014 (being generous, again) is $1 B in sales for their company, for ~13 million in profit, using the same ratios as above.  there's also the possiblity that bitcoin prices rise, but they have proven very volitile.  
What's the possible downside?  value of bitcoin drops 75%, and they  lose could lose $750 million, if they're holding onto those bitcoins.  boom - there goes a full year of profit.  you can bet you lose your job for that bad of a mistake.  Heck - let's just say bitcoins stay even - the US government could possibly go after you for being a money launderer.  potential legal fees would instantly be in the millions, given the rate of good lawyers.

everyone who already has a fixed mortgage when/if hyperinflation shows will pay the same fixed amount, and hyperinflation means money is worth less.  example: instead of earning 10 an hour people would earn 100 an hour if inflation hit 1,000% in a year, while their mortgage payment stays fixed at 1,000 per month.  
landlords would hit the lottery and raise rents as often as possible, hyperinflation hurts banks and bond holders worse than anyone

It all depends on what you're planning to do with the money... you have to remember it could become worthless, so don't take *too* much risk, but if i were you, I think the equivalent of 20k into bitcoin would be prudent.

hope this is a lesson - bitcoin users are a bit too greedy &amp; focused on each coin being worth $50-100K, so they aren't spending, while dodgecoins grow because of the number of transactions and ease of use.

i do as often as possible.  
I have a few friends who were interested in bitcoins.  one handed me $1,000 and said "invest this" back when it was $75, and my response was "it could double 10 times, it could go to $0 overnight - are you prepared for either"   I hope everyone on here is prepared for either because both are very possible.  If you're hoarding, don't be greedy, and don't be stupid - unless bitcoins are distributed, they aren't money, period.  we need to be buying and selling often to show others we want to use bitcoin as a payment process.  set a number you're OK with losing, keep that in bitcoins and don't touch it, beyond that, do what you can (everyone is different) to spend those bitcoins as cash and distribute the $ through the financial system.  
If we want to get rich we need to do it together and work together, and keep in mind the law of supply and demand.  Price of bitcoins will go up when the supply decreases and demand increases - the best way to increase demand is by adding new entrants, as only about 1% of the population knows about this and cares about it.  if they think bitcoins are for hoarding and are a pyramid scheme, that perception can allow politicians to make laws against us, which could push back our gains by a decade, easily.  
Spend the bitcoins you can afford to and you'll get businesses interested, and the perception will be better, and there will be much more pressure on lawmakers to legitimize our currency - for the betterment of the whole community :)
@_date: 2014-01-18 22:01:15
depends on how much they trust the value of bitcoin to be stable.  if they think the value of bitcoin could drop in the next few weeks, they'd be better off selling them for cash today rather than spend months waiting for a potential payoff.

I'm just countering your point that homeowners would get screwed.  fixed rate mortgage means fixed payments, and hyperinflation results in increased wages.
wages have increased with ( and above) inflation for people who are in the right industry, or have the right skills.  engineers, architects, software programmers, business owners have done great in the last few decades, although I'll concede the majority of workers have gotten the short end of the stick.
banks raise rates for all new contracts and all floating rate contracts; it's illegal to raise payments on fixed rate mortgages.

what i did - my parents have a business filing cabinet at their house, so i created a folder and put my paper wallet in there.  I feel like that is relatively safe for the amount of $ i'm holding, if i had more i'd probably go with a bank safe.  Additionally, i have a real wallet i've never lost, and i wrote out the private key on a piece of paper i keep in my wallet. 
If my parents house ever catches fire or gets robbed, i'll instantly pull the $ using the private key in my wallet.  If i ever lose my wallet or it gets stolen, first thing i do is call my parents and have them pull the $ using the private keys.  The only real way i'd lose out is if someone knew what they were stealing (still very unlikely) and instantly used those private keys.
good luck-

i graduated college in 2006, parents gave me roughly $20K play money to invest with in 2008, because i was always able to do very well with stock market games.  
I lost a lot in oct. 2008, but knew the market goes up and down... and after a bad down, it goes up.  I've been beating the market since then, honestly, with every investment i've made since then - BP after it went to the 30's (from the spill) bought a short-sale house in 2011, was heavily invested in banking &amp; insurance stocks in general over this timeframe.  Then in Jan/Feb 2013 i found bitcoin.... and here i am.  the investment has done great since i bought a large chunk @ $75, but since i've been buying a lot in the 500's my average buy in price is probably closer to $250.

no chance of it happening anywhere near that fast.  the money has to come from somewhere, bitcoin at $500K would mean the entirety of bitcoin is worth ~5 Trillion Dollars; around the price of all gold produced in the world, ever. no matter how optimisitc i may be on the price of bitcoin in the long run, there is simply no chance that governments allow money to flow that fast from any asset class into another.  Guaranteed, you'd see the US, chinese, Europe and OPEC fight against/resist it, as hard as they could, if bitcoin price reached even just 10,000
Also, if bitcoins reach a price around $100,000, i'm sure there would be a very large growth in other digital currencies.  Bitcoin is a great system, sure, and the best out there, but at those price levels it's impossible for others to not push hard for their digital currency to be recognized, too.  
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:28:37
supply and demand.  
Mt. gox was hacked, as well as some other sites.  that means a LOT of people have had their bitcoins stolen.  the "theives" are probably selling the bitcoins they had or using them as currency to buy stuff - the end result of either of those is an increase in supply, as most websites just take the bitcoins and sell them.  
when supply increases, demand must also increase, or prices will decrease.  that's all we're seeing now - the re-supply of old coins back into the market is increasing faster than demand for new coins is, so the price goes down.
give it time - eventually, demand should pick up again, especially if it looks like the govt. isn't going to place burdensome restrictions on bitcoin transactions.

"could exist without Bitcoin" - while you're right, this argument can be used at any point over the next several decades - bitcoin does not *need* to exist for transactions, and the world has done just fine without having bitcoins for centuries.  
That said - i'm holding bitcoins because i think long term, they'll be another option for consumers to use in transactions worldwide.  they will help transact between currencies quicker and cheaper, and likely with less inflation than FIAT currencies. Sure, it's speculative and based on the future, but it's where we are right now, until things change slowly over time.
that said, i predominantly use bitcoin through overstock and to get giftcards.  if/when it's more accepted i'll switch my buying patterns, but for now there's much more value to me in holding my bitcoins, but again i view them as speculative investments... it is what it is, which is why its value fluctuates so much, which should continue for at least a few more years.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:46:13
amazon is growing market share, and doing so at a loss, because it's good for them long-term.  IMO - it's in the best interest of the collective of bitcoin owners if the cost of the atms is ~3%... otherwise, noone is going to use them, and bitcoin price will continue to fall.  higher prices might give someone more profit per person but will not give them a better ROI over the long run.
a BTM owner should own enough bitcoins that the ATM fees are nice but not a huge profit, but you can make plenty, *plenty* of money as adoption picks up and the price of btc goes to the moon! :)

It's seen as anti-competitive, or "only good for drug dealers".  this could keep it's price down for a long, long time, long enough to build a new P2P banking system with many similar qualities to bitcoin.
Off the top of my head, those are the main ones.... you got any i'm missing?   I'm always *very* clear to friends that if they invest, my advice to them has always been to emulate me, and expect either $10K minimum or bust.

Can anyone state with confidence "There isn't $300 billion worth of capital that would move to a new asset class of digital money, of which bitcoin could take 30-50%"
I'll remind you, Blackrock recently reported there's ~$50 T sitting in cash.

Resilience is built into the system.  We have btg, bch, btc - pick one or hold all 3.  No worries from me, I think hash power is a bit overrated, and the economics of the situation are only so dynamic because of how young bit coin is.  As it grows in price, mining power will also grow, and decentralization aught to occur naturally.
Best thing you can do is be informed, and buy / mine the best chain.  Bch may be a clever attack but it's going to fail without good, quality developers growing the code.  Also, a 51% attack is going to be expensive, and not very effective - the entire block will slow but not be reordered.  In that time it's best to just act like power is out and banks are closed, you can access your money after power is restored.

Sterling has a money supply of ~$3T.  Inflation is targeted at 2%, or $60B per year, that government is allowed to print, taking from savers.

Bitcoin will be a fad until inflation ramps up in the us.  For the average person, bitcoin is still too volitilitile and risky to replace a savings account, and if inflation is 0-1% it's difficult to get a sense of urgency to protect your money.

In the last 5 years, inflation in the US has been around 1.5% per year.   I don't see it going lower, FED'S goal is 2%, and in the 70's and 80s it averaged closer to 5%.

while parts of what i'm saying might be wrong, at least part of it is accurate.  let me try to clarify my statement -- 
gambling, investing, and speculating are all jargon to describe risking one's capital with the hope it appreciates in value -- the difference is how historically, those odds have performed (knowing the future is impossible)
completely agree with your statement 1.  
2 - it's a fine analog; and i could compare mt. gox to coinbase if i wanted.  there are certainly both similarities and differences; and hindsight in regards to enron and mt gox is 20/20
3 - how do you measure risk?  often it's based on past performance -- works well enough but some inherit flaws.  There was a line in Mohammed El-Ehrani's book "Central banks: the only game in town" where in october 2008 he called his wife to tell her to withdraw whatever she could from the ATM *that night*, likely only $500, because he saw confidence in the dollar collapsing.  Sometimes, the unexpected happens.
4 - completely agree.  bitcoin is my hedge, i don't call it an investment. (considering my first point, i realize the hypocricy of my statement; words are flawed lol )
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:58:31
...because a lot of people need to believe they aren't gambling.

Several years later, he went bankrupt on real estate bets.

Inflation is currently about 2% in the US, so if you hold "real money" you expect it to lose its purchasing power by about that amount per year.  Might not seem like a lot, but every ~30 years you purchasing power drops by half.
With bitcoin, or other real assets, you expect them to maintain their value, or even go up.
As for the transactions and debit card... well, you could also use PayPal or Google wallet or apple pay.  Bitcoin should eventually reach near universal acceptance, but we've got a long way to go before then.

I got in big with btc at 75 in 2013.  At 1100, I felt I knew it would fall, but was unable to sell because I promised myself I wouldn't.  People said all sorts of things to me after it went to 200.  But I believed, and never bet more than I could afford to lose.
Friends of mine were convinced to buy in @ beginning of the 2017, fluctuating between 800 and 1000.  "What price should I get in at, what should be my entry strategy?".  My response - 
Bitcoin is a pool party, and I'm at the deep end, all alone, having a blast.  I do not care about how you get in, slowly wading or jumping off the high-dive - once you are in the pool, stay as long as you can.
I made a fairly large move to Eth at 370 - not with any of the bitcoins, but new Fiat.  This dip is great for adding to the position.  If proof of stake works, I'll probably never sell either.
Inflation sucks, and stocks are richly valued (high PE ratio).  I still own my condo from college and the house I plan to die in.  Commodities are fairly priced - crypto is a part of any well diversified portfolio; anyone who tells you otherwise is only lying to themselves.

give it a few weeks/months/years.  there will be attacks on bitcoin, much worse than yesterday's fall, with actual teeth.  but i have a much lower view of the fiat's.  we're at a historic point in world history, and things don't happen overnight.  give it a decade or 2, bitcoin (or another online currency) WILL have a market cap of $50 billion, minimum.  (yes, yesterday sucked, and yesterday is a single day.  i'm talking about long term, meaning years and years and years)

smartly written article.  "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" seems to be advice often lost on the greedy as they buy into any asset they know little about, based on speculation.  it's happened with any bubble, as well as the bubbles that weren't (if a bubble never pops).

could you at least elucidate on the "ignorance" bit?  from what i see, the US government has a large amount of debt; close to what we had after WW2.  we'd need to cut spending and raise taxes to balance the budget, which currently operates at a 1 trillion dollar/year deficit.  i don't see congress attempting fix that, they're too busy with beating last minute budget deadlines... as a betting man, i think they'd rather let the next generation deal with 10% inflation than cut spending or increase taxes.  it may be an erroneous opinion of mine, but it isn't ignorant.

29 year old nerd here, i was a finance major, and consider myself to be quasi-libertarian.  I'd like to counter some of your points, just so you can defend them and make them look better (or worse) to me, if you would be interested.  
1- "no way of interfering when a crash happens" - facts are there is no centralized power, and power rest with the people.  IMO - the centralized power causes more pain than it cures.  since clinton, possibly earlier, the idea was that poor people would be better able to help theirselves if they owned property.  it's a good intention, but it ended with the subprime-mortgage crisis.  without guaranteed loans offered by fannie &amp; freddie, the bubble wouldn't have been so inflated, and the "crash" wouldn't have been so drastic.  
2 - I completely agree with you, however, it's a new currency and small in scale.  as it grows in size I expect the volatility to decrease.
3 - in 10 years that may be the case, it may not be.  it only really hit the media in 2012/2013, so it's too early for either of us to know the future.
4 - gold, cash, and other sources can be just as anonymous.  if i were a drug cartel leader, you'd never catch me actually holding any drugs or taking any money from a person for drugs - i'd have minions to do that for me.  it's my understanding that's already happened with HSBC - the drug cartel leaders told their underlings to deposit the cash, who gave it to bank tellers.  Cartel heads &amp; HSBC heads don't get their hands dirty.
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:29:47
it's also a good way to help hide the reality: we effectively have a regressive tax system, despite the seemingly  "progressive" income taxe rates.  if you look at the entirety of total taxes paid as a percentage of total income, it hurts the little guy that he's spending all his money on needs, while the well off decide how much to spend on wants.  
Sales tax disproportionately hurts the poor more than the rich, and IMO, never should have been created (with the possible exception of large purchases, such as cars/houses).

right, in terms of tax evasion.  i'm referring to legacy wealth... once you've earned your money and paid taxes on it, turn it into bitcoin and leave it there.  you can give it to your kids, your grandkids... whoever you want, and when you die, they wouldn't be able to track who got what.  just saying it's another way for the extremely wealthy to hide away some of that wealth.

it's not so much the banks you have to worry about - it's the governments.  at the end of the day, banks have to compete, and will.  governments can do what china did, and make it illegal.  i would bet satoshi knew how disruptive a competing currency would be, especially since it's deflationary in nature.  if / when inflation really hits (i.e., 1970's style inflation in the US) - I believe bitcoins will be worth quite a bit more, which is why i'm holding the few that i have, spending just a few here and there :)

1. it's a competing currency.  the US dollar loses value every single day due to inflation - even if it's a small amount.  bitcoin offers a better store of value, which *is*, in effect, a small discount.  (if inflation rises, this will become more impactful).  there isn't much competition in america in terms of currency, but if you go to argentina or certain african countries, it's a full-on industry.
2. "price" is relative.  gallon of gas used to cost less than $1.  oil used to be free, few centuries ago.  currently, yes, it's all speculative growth, but it's very, very easy to "flip a switch" and allow your company to accept bitcoin.  it seems to me that's what speculators are hoping will happen.  Also - it dosen't matter, yet.  it may grow into a currency, it may grow into a commodity - store  of value only, no use as transactions.  it's an interesting possibility, imo.
3. yes.  especially if bitcoin catches on, there will be stronger competition... it's anyone's guess what will come next. currently, my guess (and the market's, obviously) is that bitcoin is the best current option.
4. solar EMP could wipe out all network connections, and destroy the value of all bitcoins.  we'd have worse problems on our hands if that happens, though... and that's why i don't have more invested.
to address your first points... high prices will go hand in hand with less volitility, just due to scale.  with bitcoin at $100 million, a single person could make the value quadruple, and then decimate it's value.  at 100 billion, it would be much, much more difficult to make that large of a dent - less volitility.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:27:34
everyone has reasoning, some is more sound than others.  currency, all currency, only holds any value due to confidence.  even gold, if people realize it's just a shiny lump of atoms, will lose value without confidence.  
in 20-30 years, IMO, it's possible there will be more confidence in a decentralized currency that is immune to the money-printing, manipulative ways of the fiat currencies. it will take a long time to get there; for sure, but people already trust credit cards as currency.  back in the 80's, it wasn't a sure thing, and an investment in visa would have earned you a big profit to date.  visa changed the way we look at money, but has since become a lumbering, corrupt giant.  the future is not visa, it's something new, i think that new thing will be bitcoin.
no point in arguing though.  who cares who wins an internet argument?  we both have our beliefs; i think bitcoin will jump when the next euro country goes bankrupt or the US stops doing it's QE3, or when a state like Il or Cali goes bankrupt. if that dosen't happen, sure, bitcoin will go back to it's $5 range, as people will still use it to buy their drugs off SR.

does grandpa have a smartphone?  if not, he may not be the best candidate for using bitcoins. 
for smartphone users, if you "know a guy" or if there's a bitcoin meetup, it's very easy for someone to hand me $100, and I could send them however many bitcoins that converts to via coinbase and/or e-mail.  if you're already setup with a coinbase account, it's really easy to recieve $.
I bring this up because for someone who has trouble learning how to use a smartphone, bitcoin may be slightly too complex for them at this point.  make one small mistake and poof, your password is stolen and those bitcoins aren't ever coming back to you.  Until you feel comfortable with the technology of getting them offline, i don't think anyone should have more than, say, $5K in bitcoins. (obviously that amount is dependant on each individuals tolerance for loss, and how much $5K means to that person)

have you read "the psychology of investing"?  it's shaped my views on investment almost as much as Buffet has.  
that said, i consider myself a young economist who thinks the long-run outlook for bitcoin is good, but i will say nothing of the short term (3-5 years).   it's good to diversify though, and i think it's crazy for someone to instantly write it off just because it's "new".  so was google once, so was apple once, so was disney once (and so was toys.com lol)

i disagree.  imo - the price jumped from 1,000 to $1,200 mostly because ordinary people used their bitcoins for black friday, and replenished those bitcoins.  
businesses who accept bitcoin, have accepted it... and then promptly converted to cash to decrease their exposure to bitcoin, because they need to pay their bills in cash.  those sales pushed the price back where it was - $1,000.
i believe that those businesses who are accepting bitcoin will continue to accept it as a means of payment.  they already have sales from this weekend.  IMO - this may repeat itself several times, the more businesses see it as being a way to increase sales, the majority will do it, even if there's volitility.  if they sold at $950, i hope they realize they should have held till it went back up.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:24:52
best bet - buy $50 worth every week or 2, or whatever time frame you feel comfortable with, and with whatever amount of $ you feel comfortable with.  you'll take the volatility out of your gains, as you'll continue putting in the same fixed amount every fixed time period, so fluctuations between time periods become less and less important.
this is a fairly usual stock trading tactic, i've recommended similar strategies for my friends who want to get in but don't have tons of $ to invest just yet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:11:00
one might consider converting dollars to bitcoin, then bitcoin to any other currency.  you could convert it out into, say, pesos, yen, pounds... and do it in whatever country you like, including low-tax havens.  
also, as bitcoin infastructure grows, you might see the filthy rich just spend in bitcoin.  even if it's not a lot, you could buy your cars with it (i read an article recently about someone buying a porche with bitcoin)
i'm not saying someone would use bitcoin to 100% evade taxes, but if you're leaving your kids 20 million, why not have 2-3 mil of it in bitcoin?

oh, I pay taxes... property taxes, income taxes, sales taxes, estate taxes, and to top it off... capital gains taxes.
as far as this goes, i don't see how the government is going to see anything beyond than i put X into an exchange to buy bitcoins, and from there i transferred them out.  it would be very difficult to prove the bitcoins i'm paying for this service with (say $500) only cost me $100
society does need taxation, but it does not require the tax code to be so complex you have to be a lawyer / accountant to get through it.  in a perfect world, tax code would be much simpler.  a government *could* get by with only a tax on income

"risk the family business" - come on, that's not realistic.  if they do $500 worth of repair and get extra business from someone like me, who'd prefer to spend the $ i've made (rather than sell &amp; be taxed something crazy like 30%) - there's a good chance they won't go bankrupt if the $500 *were* to go to $0.  
most small business owners have at least a few $100K in assets, and about 80% of the population still hasn't even heard about bitcoins yet.  I don't see what "risk" BTC poses that would wipe out the company...
@_date: 2013-03-29 14:25:14
i hope a big exchange isn't hacked, or shit could go to hell real quick.  also, the UN might institute a high tax or fee for converting bitcoins, just out of fear their member currencies will have more competition.

same as any commodity, including stocks, or just general goods.
say there's 100 apples.  what are those apples worth?  $100?  $200?  or $50?  at the end of the day, they are worth what people are willing to sell them for, and others are willing to buy them for.  
i can make an offer for $1 per apple.  if that's accepted, then the apples as a whole are, at that moment, valued at $100.  then, i go to buy another apple; this time, noone will sell an apple to me for less than $2.  therefore, the value of those apples jumped to $200.  as long as noone wants to get rid of their apples for less than $2, the value of apples will be $2.  
the same thing goes for bitcoins.  if the price is $200/bitcoin, that means noone is willing to sell for a penny less than $200, at that exact instant.  prices fall and rise as people change their opinions, and just in general, do business (suddenly a merchant wants to cash out, he'll sell his bitcoin at $199.90, the new value for all bitcoins just fell $.1)

20-50 million is small change to many bankers.  this ONE GUY lost 2 billion dollars.  that's the entire value of all bitcoin at it's max, and ONE SINGLE GUY lost that.
there are absolutly hundreds, if not thousands, of people with access to that kind of money.  hell, when Lehman went out of business, OIL lost $20 (about 15%) overnight.  
bitcoin had a market cap of 2 billion?  the top 5 oil companies have a market cap of 1.2 TRILLION.  lehman bros was able to fuck with the price of oil, other bankers are/were doing the same with the housing market, gold, silver, etc. etc. etc.  is it that hard to believe one of those hedge fund managers saw an easy opportunity for a guaranteed minimum 20% return over the course of 2 months?

lack of clarity from govt.  Once there are rules and regulations around bitcoins that the US govt will hold to (example - any conversions must pay a 5% "tax", sales tax for all bitcoin purchases is a hard 10% federal, regardless) - you'll see the price of bitcoins soar several hundred percent.  
almost all of the arguments i hear against bitcoins (from my friends &amp; family who arne't invested) is that the govt. will outlaw bitcoins.  that's impossible, but they can regulate it in a way that deflates it's price for a generation or so... once the govt's do whatever regulation they are going to, (there will be some, sorry libertarians.  i'm with you that there shouldn't be but there will be) - you'll have large corporations and hell, even countries, adapt to bitcoins, funneling billions into the system.
other stuff is all "nice to haves", imo.  price will go up or down a bit, but you'll see money flow in hand over fist once govt. regulations become a bit more clear.

thank you for saying this much, much more eloquently than i am capable of.  I have 5-10 friends I talk to about bitcoin, and i told them i was invested at $75 - one buddy gave me $1,000 to buy some bitcoins for him.   the first thing I said to him was "any money you give to me to invest, i want you to assume is gone forever and you'll never see it again".
He was scared out of it, and didn't invest.  although he's a bit regretful now, he's been buying in since then, and only with what he's willing to lose. it really takes the stress out of it when you look at it like lost money from the beginning :)

i honestly think that someone (or some entity) bought in with what they consider play money (10-100 million) a few months ago, and today, they pulled it out.  at the same time, they orchestrated a DDOS to further scare people.  
now, they can buy in with the money they had before (at reduced prices) and wait for people to come back to bitcoin.  IMO - bitcoin is the future.  the true market value of bitcoins, once adopted by general public, for sending $$, hiding transactions, and storing wealth (away from fiat currency inflation) would be in the trillions, not billions.
as a point of reference, amazon (a single company) earned over 500 billion in revenue last year.  the market is there
as another point of reference, the koch brothers wealth increased 6 billion last year (per brother, and yes, in one year).  when they leave $$ to their heirs, it will be heavily taxed, unless it's hidden somewhere safe, where govt's cant see it.  cyprus used to be a good place to hide your money... not anymore.

considering all that, why would anyone want to own any of those currencies?  all of them will go down in value when inflation happens.  Bitcoin, meanwhile, has deflation built into it, and it's current growth is only due to the extremely sharp increase in demand.

please read warren buffett's letter to the shareholders.  they are available online, and at r/investing.  he'll tell you that you can't predict anything over the next week or 2, as speculation can go any direction the wind blows; but to make investing decisions based on a 5, 10, or 15 year timeframe, as that will weed out the speculation and give time for your expectations to play out.
long term, i believe in bitcoin, so i own as much as i can lose comfortably.  if you believe in it, i encourage you to do the same, if you are making a bet on the short term, i strongly encourage you to save your money for some sort of physical asset, such as real estate or something you can (and will) actually "use".

if in 2007, i told you the dow would crash 50% as a result of the housing bubble, would you have called that fear mongering?
here's what i'm fearful of -   Total Debt per person = 53K, total debt per taxpayer = 148K.  and rising.  congress needs to cut 1.1 trillion dollars from the defecit JUST to keep that number from going up even more.  
do you have 148K to hand over to the govt?  oh, don't forget... that's an average per person.  if we go to, say, the south side of chicago, the average person does not (and will not) have the ability to pay that in their lifetime; others will need to pick up their slack.
Don't forget, that number refers to what we've already spent in the past, and does not include future payments to social security and medicare, both of which get more expensive as baby boomers retire.
and finally, here's some charts on inflation - 
we're spending much more than we have.  congress has shown no appetite for increasing taxes in a meaningful way; congress has shown it does not want to cut spending in a meaningful way either.  they need to cut over a trillion dollars in spending AND, at the same time, collect 148K per taxpayer to make up for past expenses.  
i don't see congress doing that.  Do you?  
they really only have 2 alternatives:  1 - default on our debt, or do some sort of interest holiday or whatever to cut down on the past expenses; either will increase our future cost to borrow.    2 - print more cash.
I am not fear mongering.  i honestly believe that in the next 5-10 years, congress will print more money to pay our debts.

which government?  lets say the US, just because it's the largest.  now, all US bitcoin investors determine that the US isn't friendly to bitcoin users.  they may sell, and bitcoin may go to the wayside for a year or 2, and it's value may go to $30 and stay there for a while.
however.... bitcoin would still be legal in korea.  japan.  china.  russia.  india.  nigeria.  mexico.  canada.  iraq.  iran.  saudi arabia.  the Philippines.  Indonesia.  austrailia.  new zeland.  pakistan.  yemen.  cyprus.  greece.  france.  germany.  the UK.  the congo.  south africa. Iceland.  Ireland  and i didn't even mention one country in south america...
I'm quite sure i've left other areas of the globe off the list above, let alone the number of countries that i've missed.  i could see you being correct about the "chain reaction", but i can't imagine it not sticking somewhere.  
as long as it sticks in one or 2 countries, anywhere, i'm quite sure that after 10 years, it's value would increase enough that my holdings would be of some sort of value - even if it was made illegal in the US, i'd still probably hold on, just because i believe in the technology that much.  and after those countries do well, i could see the rest of the world being forced to take notice, and more countries joining in.  having that much less friction on a currency is a great thing, and i think the world will be forced to take notice.

the value of any currency rest in the confidence users have in it.  plain and simple - there's more confidence, prices are rising.  the maximum depends on how confident people are in it's value. what's the max?   well.... some people compare it to gold.  if they are right, the max would be in the hundred thousands... if they are wrong, it could be $0.  
welcome to speculation :)

"some people won't accept a repayment" - they'll have to, wont' they?

1. well gee, I guess I'll give away all this gold I have, since they aren't making any more of that either, and deflation sounds terrible!  
2. early adoption involves risk, what is the incentive if there's no reward?  (Numerous experts believed the real estate bubble was froth.  why would anyone with a brain trust "experts", over their own reason?)
3. if they ever stop mineing bit coin b/c it's too expensive, um... ok.  that won't have any effect on bit coin other than lower supply, if demand stays constant, price would go up

there are tens of thousands of bitcoin enthusiast.  some get it; some don't.  the ones that don't will almost always outnumber the ones that do.
that said, the ones that get it are OK with this blip.  if you came in expecting to be a millionaire tomorrow, you are ignorant of basic tenants of investing, especially Risk/Reward.  
don't bet what you can't afford to lose.  and don't bet on things you aren't sure of.  if someone is going to "game the system" - let them.  in the long run, if people are smart, they'll continue to use bitcoins, and keep a portion of their portfolio invested, and reap the long-term profits.  
the people who buy and sell quickly, tend to do fantastically in the short run, and burn out after a few years.  you can bet the farm and be right 99% of the time, but do it wrong once and you're bankrupt.

in general, the govt has a very, very good system in place to track your income.  if you lie about your income, you'll probably get caught, i can agree with that.
however, the government does not have a good system in place to track your spending.  that may change in the future, but for now, it's pretty easy to buy things and not report it to the IRS.  there are many cash businesses that exist; it's easy to buy things used or through an intermediary.  they can report the sale, but if the reciept says "paid cash"....
if you still think i'm wrong, what's with all the talk about offshore tax havens?  the woudn't exist if the govt was that good at tracking money, right?

exhchanges are nice, but there's a whole infastructure that needs to be created for bitcoin to take off to a trillion dollar market cap.
until it's easy to convert and use bitcoins, there will be drastic ups and downs.

i'll do my best, i've been around a full year but am also not much of a techie - 
1- yes.  if you're american, i'd recommend coinbase.com - been the best to me so far
2- it's more like converting from USD to Euro or Peso - you've likely done it at a currency exchange before.  owning a dollar is owning a promise from the US govt. that it's value is 100 pennies.  the promise here is from the confidence of the community - hence it's current volitility, as it's relatively small (market cap of 10B is very small relative to other, more established currencies)
3 - try coinbase.  i'm sure they'll have something set up so it isn't too hard - link a bank account and press buy.
4 - yes!  from most exchanges you can e-mail someone $, or send it to their "wallet" - if he dosen't have one setup yet he'll need one, but can do that after you send him the bitcoin.
PM me if you have any noob questions, i'd like to help if possible.  spreading &amp; improving the community creates mutual benefit :)
