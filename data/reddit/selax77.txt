How? If you mean What, then nothing at all. Sign up, and we'll send you the card. Once you have received it then we can load up cash onto it whenever you wish to trade in your bitcoins.

Sounds amazing.  Will definitely support financially

Nyc smac all the way!! Right around the corner from it.  Although I am long on bitcoin

Sorry adamcol not at this time, we had to temporarily halt the credit card part of our system for now while we figure out better security so our customers aren't feeling we will be buried under charge backs.  
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:07:42
As just mentioned, we were relying on the "digital signature" and agreement of terms which our processor lays out in their own terms of service for need to combat any future charge backs.  Future additions may be added when we continue credit card support, such as, but not limited to, verification charges, photo identification, and/or digitally written signature authentications.

Thanks BuyBitcoinUS for that amazing page! Wish we knew this existed months ago when we first started! Best of luck back to ya!
@_date: 2013-08-01 01:59:03
At this point in time, all orders have either been completed, or have been refunded if something looked wrong to us.  If you are still having trouble, perhaps your account was credited back the amount.  Feel free to email us at admin with the email you used to purchase so that we can look into which status your order fell into.  
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:26:03
Thanks elan96! Yes we have seen the virwox model, and were basing some of our limit ideas off their success in the charge back field they have made.  Proof of ID is another step we hope to implement soon, as long as it doesn't scare people off.
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:19:52
We have not looked into google wallet yet, but if it shows potential then it may be a future possibility.  But for now, we can not accept google wallet until we make sure everything works, Thanks for the idea!
@_date: 2013-07-31 01:58:08
You can use Bitcoins to refill the card at any point and will only need one card. 
Thanks for the support guys!

Wow, what a great turn out of replies and feedback! Sorry for the delayed responses everyone, I'll attempt to write back to each comment one by one, oldest to newest.  As you may have noticed, we have been getting quite a few questions about credit card fraud, systems in place, and many concerns.  With all this in mind, and the information and scenarios provided by BuyBitcoinUS and andrethegiantshead, we have decided to temporarily halt credit card transactions until we feel we have a more secure system in place.  We were currently relying on "digital signatures" and were going to implement a few more verification steps as the beta continued, but for now we are rethinking the way we handle the credit/debit cards in all. 
All previous transactions will be processed by the end of the day, so if you had your foot in the door early and there is a charge, you'll be receiving your coins in the coming hours (and if you were charged twice by perhaps refreshing your browser during transaction or other ways your second charge will be refunded when the coins are sent from the first transaction).  
Apologies for the wall of text, just wanted to get it all out there. While we are going to be implementing future ways to transfer cash to Bitcoins, the BitQuick Card will remain open, and continue uninterrupted.  Thanks for giving us a shot and aiding us in this open beta, the Bitcoin community as always is simply amazing!

Where do I find the pool that found the block...thanks so much guys...really appreciate it
@_date: 2013-07-30 23:59:15
We are currently just doing $35/$150 (24hr/30day) limits until we are out of beta. Hopefully we will be out soon!
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:07:30
Used them the other day and they were great....extremely fast and sent my moneypak to me within a day!!!!
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:18:07
No super crazy state of the art system, just consent of customers to purchase at a low price, and run all the information provided to prove the card holder must at least know a lot about the account in order to purchase. Future systems as mentioned in previous comments may be added to avoid card fraud. 
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:36:24
So sorry keeron! No scam here.  We are unsure how you ended up getting two pending transactions unless you or your browser somehow triggered sending the data twice around the same time.  We have had 2 cases in which this happened (perhaps you) and need to verify all the information before we payout, due to fraud concerns.  If this is the case, then once we verify the charge is rightful, we will send you the first transactions worth, and refund your second charge. This will all be resolved by the end of the day, so please have patience with us.  
As for the confirmation email, we have been getting emails and comments about it going to spam, possibly check there? And the logging in part is just odd, since to even place an order you must be logged into the system or the page doesn't show or accept your information. So not sure where you fall on that, whether you logged out or not after purchasing.  
We will definitely be implementing a lost password function due to your issue alone keeron, we are sorry it didn't work out with the username and password for you. But thanks for letting us know!

Why not try? Also in response to the comment that was deleted.  They can convert the bitcoins straight to usd- that would mean volatility does not matter for them. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:44:27
he doesnt even have a twitter account....
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:12:56
Yeah, that seems to be the general consensus of reddit at the moment.  We were really hoping with the low limit and a trust in the community that fraud would be deterred, but in the sake of safety we have temporarily stopped accepting cards unfortunately.

Hey guys, 
I just wanted to inform you of our new service BitQuick.net. We allow users to purchase bitcoins with a credit card. In addition we are offering our users a way to cash out their bitcoins with the BitQuick Debit Card. Currently, we have a buy limit of $35/$150 (24hr/30day) until we are out of beta. There are no limits on selling bitcoins. 
We are registered as a MSB with finra and registered as an LLC in delaware. We have opened for business before but had to make some changes. We have previous reviews. 
Let us know what you think! Feedback is always appreciated!

Good find! Thanks for letting us know, we have removed the empty link as it was redundant with the FAQ's and about pages.
@_date: 2013-07-31 00:15:43
We are keeping limits low so that we can build trust with our customers. 
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:24:47
13 hours? Extremely sorry for the wait! We will be getting on that shortly!  Definitely by the end of the day you will have your coins in wallet. As for emailing when complete purchases, we do not at the moment. We were planning on full email update notifications if the users wanted throughout the process such as when they purchased, money was received, and when the order was payed out, but then our (awesome) email system got tangled and began ending up in spam... So until we fix whatever is going on there, we have stopped email notifications.  But they will be active soon! Thanks for asking and trying us out!
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:15:20
Thanks for the insight pilaf and ninjalong! We are now aware some email systems are flagging our confirmations as spam, possibly due to the image and formatting of the email? We are trying to figure this out.
Nonetheless, we are looking into another email system which will no longer be spam flagged, and cause issues for future customers.
