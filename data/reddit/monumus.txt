I was torn when I saw Coinbase unveil their payment pages, because I think simplifying the address system is a good thing, but I'd much prefer a decentralized solution like Onename.

He can setup an account with BitPay and have his donations converted to dollars and placed in a bank account. BitPay will do this for free for nonprofits.

@_date: 2014-10-21 08:37:42
In a sentence, because of bitcoin's multi-faceted network effect.
If you think of a basic one-sided network, like Facebook or MySpace, it's only the users that make up the network. If something new comes along that's more compelling to users, they simply migrate (see MySpace to Facebook)
eBay or Craigslist are examples of two-sided networks - the buyers are there because the sellers are there and vice versa. This is much "stickier" than a one-sided network and the reason that Craigslist specifically has been able to stick around for so long despite it's limited development, UI, etc. It's simply where buyers and sellers know where to find each other.
Bitcoin has an even stronger network effect. It's the cryptocurrency with the most users and accepting merchants and this dynamic is seen by the development community as well. This means that the vast majority of development in the cryptocurrency space is going into bitcoin. On top of that, the investor/VCs see that bitcoin is where the buyers, sellers, and developers are, so that's where they pour money into. You don't see many VC-backed litecoin/dogecoin operations for this reason.
Any altcoin has to undo these effects. And given bitcoin's open-source nature, it's almost certainly easier to augment bitcoin with whatever desirable feature the altcoin brings forward, rather than try and bootstrap an entirely new coin.
@_date: 2014-07-25 23:26:08
This is precisely why I see altcoins as being so valuable. They offer a great test bed for new features that can (hopefully) be incorporated into the coin with the largest existing infrastructure, investment, development community, etc.

@_date: 2014-09-17 22:42:45


Well, not exactly.
Bitcoin's network requires orders a magnitude more money/computational power to attack compared to all other altcoins. If you're looking for integrity in the cryptocurrency world, you're looking for bitcoin. Couple this with Bitcoin's 4+ sided network effect and there's a reason it's on top.

The term for this is 'confirmations'. On average, each confirmation takes ~10min. Although keep in mind this can vary substantially at times.
If you send your bits over to Coinbase, you'll see that you're 'receiving' them instantly, but you won't be able to spend them until they receive a certain number of confirmations (typically 3 to 6)

I think there needs to be some understanding that most of the people who could see a real, tangible benefit from bitcoin simply haven't heard of it yet.

In your 'what is bitcoin' section, I'd give a simple example comparing bitcoin to something they already know.
For example, here's my go-to for introducing bitcoin to someone who's had very little exposure:
"Bitcoin is like digital cash and I make the distinction of calling it 'cash' for a reason. In-person cash transactions have a certain dynamic to them. Only the two parties involved in the transaction are required for the money transfer to take place. But that dynamic changes when trying to send money online in that you have to introduce a third-party (Visa, Paypal, etc) in order to complete the transaction. Bitcoin changes that.
Bitcoin is the first technology that re-creates the dynamics of an in-person cash transaction, over the internet"

@_date: 2014-10-14 21:19:59
Yeah, you could still call it blockchain tech, but in my mind, it would just add a degree of complication. In the real estate example, why not just have a central ledger where home purchases are tracked? If you're establishing authority by limiting who can participate, why use the tech that's specifically designed to establish trust *without* limiting participation?
I'm certain there will be huge advancements in this space in the coming decades. Not being able to see the future, I guess I see the comments about liking the blockchain, but not bitcoin, a little like saying "I like being able to communicate with anyone, but I'm not a fan of needing a computer"

I have to say this comment made me chuckle.
What Apple is attempting to do with Apple Pay and what bitcoin is attempting to do are wildly different things. I see this like experiencing a new, more comfortable saddle and then telling Henry Ford he better get his shit together and get face time in with the local stables.
Apple Pay puts your credit card on your phone and authorizes payment via fingerprint. It's cool tech, to be sure. But that's the extent of it. You need specific hardware from a specific manufacturer in a specific country.
It's not doing anything to solve many of the systemic problems in the global economy. It's making upper middle class western life a bit easier, which is great. But let's not kid ourselves and assume bitcoin and Apple Pay are going after the same pie.
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:33:42
Some dislike them, sure. But in my opinion, those opinions are a little shortsighted. The value of altcoins is in their ability to provide a testbed for new/innovative functionality without jeopardizing the whole economy behind the coin if some vulnerability exists.
Other altcoins are fairly blatant pump-and-dumps, and people aren't huge fans of that in general.
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:58:58
I'm not sure it's an argument as much as it's a point that there are significant transactions done off blockchain.

Yes. You seem to be overlooking the fact that this entire ecosystem is 5 years old. You don't look at a child and assess how successful he/she will be by how they're arranging blocks.
Much of bitcoin is cumbersome right now. Not too many people argue that nor do many educated people argue bitcoin is ready for grandma. But if you've been around for even a year, you'll've seen major ground has been made on pretty much all fronts.
All the things you brought up are well understood and have people actively working on addressing them.
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:49:32
Regarding Ethereum, I've heard Vitalik make the comparison that if bitcoin is to be seen as digital gold, ether will be seen as digital oil. I personally like the comparison.
As for the IoT being built on Bitcoin, that's a good question. I think some of the folks involved in other projects (i.e. Ethereum) will say that Bitcoin's protocol is too limited. Proponents of side/tree-chains may disagree.
All said, I'd imagine bitcoin will play a major role in the interconnection of various devices moving forward.

Yeah, that's the same site they were using in the documentary. I believe blockchain.info tracks nodes in a unique way. They currently show ~460 nodes, when in reality, I believe the number is closer to 7,000. I think someone can give you more info about that.
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:42:50
In all reality, the supply isn't going to go to zero. That would imply literally every single bitcoin be irrecoverable. Inconceivably unlikely.
If you're referring to the supply of *new* coins, as in when the mining reward approaches zero, the miners are still incentivized by transaction fees. By the time the mining reward is ~0, if bitcoin's still around we should be seeing thousands of transactions per second which collectively will represent (hopefully) sufficient reward for miners.
@_date: 2014-09-11 19:06:12
That's a great point. Even looking out over the course of a month would only represent about half of the daily volatility.
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:55:56


That's true. Although you said this:


This is the part I have some contention with. That's certainly not to say it's impossible, but there's no glimmer of an indication that such a thing will happen, let alone be likely (which you mentioned). And in that case, everything is on the table. A Satoshi 2.0 could build a new cryptocurrency tomorrow that's technically perfect.
My point wasn't in questioning weather *a* blockchain can live without bitcoin. Obviously that's true as evidenced by the various altcoins. My point was that every blockchain comes with it a currency or value token. The means by which this token is distributed or 'minted' (PoS, PoW, etc.) is beside the point. The idea of a blockchain (which is distributed and trustless in nature) existing without the presence of this value token doesn't seem possible.


I agree no one knows what will happen. But we can certainly make educated guesses. From my view, the best educated guess is that bitcoin will continue to reign supreme. And I don't think saying that is just me backing my own horse. There's some solid evidence to support that thought. We're not necessarily looking for perfect here, or rather, let's not let perfect be the enemy of very good. It's early days, to be sure, but there's already a sizable network effect working in bitcoin's favor. There's nothing wrong with calling a spade, a spade.
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:15:09
It depends on where you're doing your purchasing. A number of organizations have chosen bits to be their default unit and most others allow the user to determine how things are displayed (USD, EUR, BTC, mBTC, bits)
Seeing at this push for bits is relatively recent, there's no real standard yet. So when you're purchasing/spending bitcoin, make sure to pay attention to units.
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:56:43
You can absolutely buy $25k worth of bitcoin, but buying thousands of bitcoins is a different story.
You either try to grab them in one fell swoop in an auction like this - something off-market - or you have to spread your buys over time.
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:37:50
It doesn't bother me because it's to be expected.
Bitcoin's had liquidity issues for its entire existence. Anytime someone wants to enter or exit the market with a sizable chunk of fiat, they can move the price considerably.
Think of it like boats in the ocean. A cruise ship has substantial mass on which only large waves make appreciable impact. A row boat, on the other hand, is tossed around by waves that would be inconsequential to the cruise ship.
Bitcoin is closer to the row boat than the cruise ship and you can think of people entering/exiting the bitcoin market as waves. It takes time to build a cruise ship and in bitcoin's case, we're trying to turn our row boat into a cruise ship while out in ocean.

Those who are holding a scarce asset are limiting supply. Now, if no one wants that scarce asset, then further limiting the supply does nothing. However, if demand rises, so does the value. This isn't a zero sum game.


Sure, there's a wealth transfer, but that would be unavoidable. If people continue to decide bitcoin has value in excess of their local currency, demand for bitcoin increases. If demand increases and supply stays constant, prices rise. 


You're making this overly complicated. Again, if demand for bitcoin increases, the price will rise. It's as simple as that. If you're arguing that since bitcoin can be 'remade' people won't migrate due to having "no interest in adopting a coin that transfers wealth away from themselves", I'd ask you: why bitcoin has seen the use it has? By your logic, anyone who's bought bitcoins has only served to transfer wealth away from themselves.

I think you're failing to see the bigger picture here. The global population by and large will only becoming increasingly comfortable assigning value to things in the digital realm.
The physical nature of gold isn't always a positive attribute. Sure, you could beat someone with a bar of gold, which I suppose has some small value, but the minute you're looking to move the gold elsewhere, all of a sudden that physicality becomes a burden. You introduce counterparty risk, you have to pay for all the logistics (shipping, insuring, overseeing), etc.
From an industrial view, aluminum is *far* more appealing than gold. So I'm not sure I'm sold on the premise that gold's value is derived from is potential to be used in a "practical" way.

The problem is with relaying price information to customers.
If a merchant priced 1.5L of milk at 50,000 bits, would that be a fair price? Most would say no. But how do they know that's an unfair price? I'd argue it's because a link has been made between BTC and USD/EUR/GBP. Without that link, there's nothing to compare to.
If bitcoin is a resounding success, then I could see the next generations having an innate understanding of the value of a bitcoin. But until then, there needs to be a way to relate a given bitcoin denomination to a real-world service/product value.

Many will argue that if the computer you were using was connected to the internet when the private keys were generated, there could be malware present that could compromise your keys. 
I think one of the safest ways to generate your keys is by saving a copy of bitaddress.org's webpage onto a USB drive, then booting into a linux live session (via USB or CD), then inserting the USB drive with bitaddress.org on it, and opening the page without configuring any internet connection.
That way there's an 'air gap' between the machine that's generating your keys and the internet.

Of course they do. The banking system is where most western people have their money. So your qualm is, what happens if the fiat banking system gives bitcoin the middle finger? I'm not sure, but that's not something I'm losing sleep over because I don't see indications of that happening.

Bitcoin is like digital cash.
If two people are sitting on a bench, and one person hands the other a $20 bill, only those two people were needed for that transaction to happen. In other words, they didn't have to use a third person to hand the money over.
This dynamic changes when you take things online. Before bitcoin, there was no way of recreating the dynamics of an in-person cash transaction over the internet - you always needed a trusted third party (Visa, MC, Paypal, etc.)
So bitcoin is the first reliable way of recreating the dynamics of an in-person cash transaction over the internet.

The vast majority of those contain an architecture very similar (if not identical) to bitcoin. You mentioned dividing the currency bitcoin from the technology Bitcoin. I'm wondering why you believe this to be plausible. Certainly no altcoin does this.
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:49:43
I don't think the idea of everyone managing 100% of their own finances is realistic. In other words, I think banking relationships will probably stick around for quite some time.
That said, bitcoin introduces the *option* of foregoing that system, and that's not something you could say prior. I don't *need* a bank account or Paypal to send money internationally. And I don't need either of them to hold money in a secure manner.
If people want the option of having a number to call in case things go wrong, or they want to place trust in a third-party, then they can be my guest. At least there's a choice now.
I guess I don't see that as any kind of critical flaw to bitcoin. Bitcoin is an option - people will use it if they see value in it, and won't if they don't. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 18:52:21
Because we're talking about money here. Getting a following for a social network or web-based startup can come incredibly quickly because people don't have to commit anything more than a few clicks.
When it comes to money, people react differently. Couple that with the fact that bitcoin is venturing into completely unknown territory, plus the early PR drama surrounding online black markets, etc., and you have a topic that produces some polarized opinions.
From my experience, most people either really like bitcoin, or they think it's total nonsense. Asking people to trade the only token of value they've ever known for something entirely novel, is a tough sell. 
Money is arguably one of the most important concepts in society. It shouldn't come as a surprise when people are hesitant to uproot and reevaluate such an entrenched and relied upon system.
@_date: 2014-10-25 21:19:43
One could start by saying all things purchased over the internet. Given the recent track record of companies storing credit card information, that's the obvious first choice. Anyone privacy-focused is likely going to side with bitcoin as well.
Not having to give any identifying information is a huge plus to a lot of people. Although, if you believe bitcoin is likely to appreciate in purchasing power over time, it makes sense to hold the bitcoin and spend the depreciating asset (USD/EUR/etc). I think bitcoin accepting merchants should start giving discounts on a more consistent basis.

A product like OpenBazaar would certainly come with it's share of depravity. I suppose I'm of the camp that feels the vast majority of people aren't looking to hire murders or distribute CP. After all, the same arguments can be made for the Internet - it enables cartels, human traffickers, hitmen, rapists, thieves, etc. a near frictionless medium to plan, coordinate, and discuss more effective ways to conduct their activities. 
Not many people will argue that the Internet has had a net negative influence on humanity, though.

You're not really looking at the bigger picture. For what it sounds like you're after, bitcoin may not be the best option yet. But there is a mountain of progress being made in this space and I think it unwise to overlook that fact.
Every technology is riddled with usability issues and friction early on. If it doesn't speak to you at the moment, that's fine, but I wouldn't actively detract from what's being done because it doesn't immediately appeal to your use case.

The friction comes in when you're dealing with a local currency. I'd maybe start talking with some of his suppliers (or wherever his money is going in Ghana) about bitcoin and if they'll consider accepting it. If you can sell the idea, every part of this process becomes easier.

@_date: 2014-07-31 18:36:51
Yeah, I agree.
My thought is that bitcoin is dealing with money. And money is a different animal than an easier method of communicating. The fact bitcoin is trying to redefine how people look at money is one of the reasons I think we see such polarized opinions on it. The people who 'get it' understand that if you look at the attributes that make something a good candidate for money, you start to see that bitcoin is arguably perfect in a few of them. But on the other hand, bitcoin is trying to undermine one of the most established social concepts that humans have, so it seems so incredibly unlikely that it will succeed simply due to the magnitude of its uphill battle.
For something to eclipse bitcoin in the digital *currency* space, there needs to be something about it that's capable of unweaving bitcoin's fairly substantial network effect. Unlike social networks that are only one-sided (whoever has the most users), or two-sided like craigslist (the sellers are there because the buyers are there, and vice versa), bitcoin has the consumer base, the merchant base, the investment base, and the development base. These four make it the obvious choice for miners which leads to it having the highest hashrate thus increasing security, and with security comes trust.
It's totally doable, but it's unlikely at this point. All that said, 20 years is a really long time, so who knows.

One thing to keep in mind is that there are ~3600 BTC added to the total supply everyday. If demand were actually stagnant, this increase in supply would cause the market price to steadily decrease. The fact the price is remaining relatively stable as of late is an indication that there's a continued increase in demand.
That said, if it's the right time for you to short, short away ;)

I always view tweets through a special lens, namely that it's oftentimes difficult to express complete ideas in 140 characters.
I do agree that if blockchain-based tech takes off (I could argue it already has), bitcoin will too. The issue with trying to introduce a blockchain that's divorced from bitcoin is essentially the same issue all the altcoins are facing. Bitcoin's network effect is incredibly strong and only getting stronger.
Here's something I wrote on that topic:


eBay or Craigslist are two-sided networks - the buyers are there because the sellers are there and vice versa. This is much "stickier" than a one-sided network and the reason that Craigslist specifically has been able to stick around for so long despite it's limited development, UI, etc. It's simply where buyers and sellers know where the other are.
Bitcoin has an even bigger network effect. It's the cryptocurrency with the most users and accepting merchants and this dynamic is seen by the development community as well. This means that the vast majority of development in the cryptocurrency space is going into bitcoin. On top of that, the investor/VCs see that bitcoin is where the buyers, sellers, and developers are, so that's where they pour money into. You don't see many VC-backed litecoin/dogecoin operations for this reason.
Any altcoin has to undo these effects. And given bitcoin's open-source nature, it's almost certainly easier to augment bitcoin with whatever desirable feature the altcoin brings forward, rather than try and bootstrap an entirely new coin.
@_date: 2014-09-29 05:31:12
What other options are there?
Going with something other than bitcoin *right now*, is going with something demonstrably worse. That's not to say that fact will remain indefinitely, but for the time being, bitcoin is the only legitimate choice.
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:30:36
Coinbase and Bitpay lock-in the bitcoin price at the time of purchase so merchants are isolated from price volatility.

For a lot of western consumers, bitcoin's appeal will be in a philosophical/ideological direction.

You're only looking at utility as it pertains to payments. Given bitcoin's fixed issuance, there's a store of value utility as well. Are people who hold gold also using it? I'd say they are. They're using it as a store of value.
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:40:23
Great question.
When you say 'open eCommerce acceptance' I assume you mean a point at which you can purchase anything online with bitcoin. That's probably a ways off if you're referring to specific vendors.
Now, the point at which you can essentially buy anything (it just may not be from your favorite vendor) is probably much closer. I feel OpenBazaar has incredible promise here.
Right now, as long as you're not particular about the vendor, I'd argue you can buy just about anything with bitcoin. You may not have multiple choices, but you can probably find someone selling &lt;insert product/service&gt; for bitcoin.

If I understand, you're concerned about peoples' ability to go from fiat to bitcoin. I don't see the options for that service decreasing. In fact, I see just the opposite. And there's always been hostility toward bitcoin. If you weren't expecting hostility, I'm not sure what you thought bitcoin was. But bitcoin continues growing and as such, it needs to be a point of discussion for more banks and companies in the finance sector. Many were able to ignore it prior, but not so much anymore.
I guess I'm having a hard time understand what it is you're getting at? Yes, bitcoin isn't necessarily a great thing for banks. Yes, they'll probably try and fight it. But what's your point? Because they're going to try and maintain a status quo, the people who want a new financial option should just throw their hands up and forget about it? You haven't discovered some previously unknown "flaw". People are working on how to address bitcoin's shortcomings. If you want something guaranteed or a pre-packaged explanation about how this is all going to play out, you'll probably have to look elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:28:55
