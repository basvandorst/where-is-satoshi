Ahh ok , I usually send at a 5 sat per byte so just have to wait and see I guess. 
Store in BTC send in LTC for me in future

It's full atm but I'll give it another go, thanks for the heads up.

Sent $160 to Binance last night, $4 fee, still waiting about 13 hours so far. 
Swimming in the endless mempool

The fact that it doesn't seem to be registering on other block explorers is a big concern. Have you tried double spending the funds, and sweeping the wallet to another address?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:50:18
Bitcoin is still a high risk investment. Portfolios should hold diversified investments to reduce risk.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:36:00
Fair play mate. Good deed for they day. What fees like atm?
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:28:54
If you are treating Bitcoin as spendable currency then you might be correct. At this point it's more stock or commodity than investment and pales in comparison to the value of the US Equities markets.

You have 1BTC worth of gold, held in an investment account. How do you get that physical asset you've bought?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:58:35
At this stage, Bitcoin will struggle to create a truly usable currency, speed, fees &amp; the lack of incentive to spend are an issue. 
Should a subchain increase speed and reduce fees. It covers two of the main failures
Should the price of bitcoin settle, and the value of the coins value growth settle to a more reconcilable rate, say 3% P.A, would that not be similar to a savings account at that stage, and significantly reduce the barrier to spending?

Currently, the fee's are really high so people are paying more and more to be included in the next block. If you had a wallet with a replace fee option you could re-issue the transaction with a higher fee, or be patient as the backlog in the mempool looks to be clearing slowly. 
I'm also not seeing the transaction ID on blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:17:53
I wonder if it's because you've sent the fund to the same address that it was sent from.

I'm happy to read on a Bitcoin crash, I like reading technical analysis in the positive and negative to get a balanced view, but the fact he's wishing harm on people simply because they might have got 'rich quick' is astounding. 
For a generation in the UK that's been almost entirely priced out of the housing market, it very unsavory. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:34:59
It's really hurting me right now. I wanted to set up loads of small paper wallets for Christmas gifts, but those fees make any small TX impossible.

Fiat replaced the gold standard because it had its problems, now fiat is showing itself to have problems with government attempts to improve growth or devalue itself. The stock markets appear propped up by this money, fiat isn't the holy grail IMO. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:30:13
If you own this wallet, aren't you also the one sending the bitcoin? Sorry very confused here.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:22:58
I posted an article a while ago that hinted that Bitcoin needed to start being used more and held less. It suggested that bookmakers &amp; casinos using Bitcoin could be a large enough industry to make a difference.

Do we need governmental adoption? Is the decentralized nature not part of the core concept of Bitcoin. It needs acknowledgement but not adoption, however, it needs adoption by commercial and private ventures. It needs people to be willing to accept a salary in BTC it is really to succeed and thrive.

Ok well your Roth IRA is a traditional tool and you will never see any gains like you're seeing with Bitcoin, however, it is much safer. 
Without knowing where your Bitcoins are held it's hard to say how to sell them other than you need to put them on an Exchange / Coinbase or Similar, these allow you to sell Bitcoin for FIAT currency. 
If you don't know exactly what you want to do with it, I'd seriously suggest leaving it right now and getting yourself up to speed on crypto. 
If your family member has invested in it big, has he given you any inclination of what he thinks you should do with the coins?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:30:23
Everybody panic sell please. Thanks.

I mean it's already invested bro. 
*  How are the coins held? 
*  Have you done a lot of research on Bitcoin?
*  Are you looking to move completely out of Bitcoin into Alts?
*  Are you looking to come out of Bitcoin into more traditional investing?
*  Are you looking to trade Bitcoin (I.e buy high and sell low)
Hit me up

UK - Tax treatment will likely depend on how the coins where acquired. If they were mined view a view to realisation of profits, then you probably carry a few badges of trade and may be tax under the Income Tax regime with taxes on profits of 20/40/45%.
If they were bought, held and sold they would likely be treated as Capital Gains. These are taxed at much better rates of 10/20% (although there is a possibility of these rising in the coming years.)
The UK allows capital gains annual allowance of £11,300 per year in gains currently which are tax-free, any other gains are then charged at the appropriate rate of tax based on your total income. 
If you are making minor gains a £11,300 liquidation per year would seem to suffice if the money isn't required immediately. If larger gains need to be realised in a shorter time frame than 20% is the likely rate. 
If the gains are very substantial it may pay to make the gains when in a difference tax residence, but the rules are complex on when you become a UK non resident for tax purposes and advice should be taken.

In the UK you actually might. Capital Gains Tax free uplift on death.

According to their support you can top up as many times as you want and for new users the daily limit is between £1k and £3k. 
If they are lower than this they should increase over time.

Not if you're within the nil rate bands, hence the might.
