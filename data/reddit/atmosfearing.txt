I'm not a hardcore trader by any means, just a highschool student trying to make money, but this is kinda just what btc does. This was expected as we're nearing March 13. 
Couple points, we're now below on the [trend line for Jan 11th]( which is obviously bad. January 11th was the day where 1btc fell down to $780 after investors freaked out because China reaffirmed that cryptocurrencies need regulations. The current value ($1,143/1btc) is really being fucked by people freaking out (like this), so our current point isn't the most consistent thing to go by, give it a couple days. On the other side, I just saw that we are on a [small rise]( Sure it may not look like much, but it shows that the btc market price is at least fluctuating, by increasing little by little after each dip. At this point those dips are much larger than the small peaks, but again at least it's fluctuating and not completely dropping. I hope, and expect, to see the market slowly increase to a normal point.
Now, if we're going to look at the [btc volatility]( it's decreased .88% over the last 60 days down to 2.17%; which is actually very nice. Still, we see a problem with paranoid traders, large and small, freaking out when Bitcoin hits mainstream media: like it has now. In the past hour though the volatility has fluctuated a shitton, that's my most professional word choice, but again this is due to paranoid people being paranoid. Atleast it's stayed fairly high?
In total it's hard to tell what to do as a small trader. I'm not the most indepth on this stuff so I could be wrong on a few points, but I'm fairly confident on atleast my stats. Again I'm hoping/expecting that btc distributes itself again in a few days, but only time will tell. Real question is what will happen if the SEC approves or denies the BTC ETF? Both choices could fuck the market up a little bit.
