Sadly I can't trust a coin or market that takes advantage of people. Bitcoin is not looking good at all with everything recently going on. Especially with Coinbase insider trading and that represents everyone in the US wanting to get in.
@_date: 2015-01-27 09:06:15
Why won't they allow us to trade? I think it's unfair. VPN I don't think that would work since most require residency papers etc.
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:26:57
Thank you!!!
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:31:12
Wow thank you so much for this info. I'll start doing this right away!
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:59:24
Well the only problem is YOU CAN'T get your money back from coinbase because of your waiver rights of buying through them. You agree it's bitocoin blah blah and shit happens. That's why they verify you and something goes wrong 99% they will win.

Dude gemini is being investigated right now. Get your coins out NOW
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:58:04
Selling everything for ETH!! I vow!
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:54:23
Why is 1 dangerous?
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:55:10
Where are my millionare shibis?
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:58:25
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:32:14
so @ 12:20pm which is about 4 hours from now I get my free bcc?
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:48:24
FREE BCC YO, but my plan is to cashout first few minutes and see what happens. Why risk losing money fast when you can buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:07:49
BTC is starting to get replaced by BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:12:08
Go on Amazon and mine with a usb stick. EZ money
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:45:33
Any chinese restaraunts or nail salons. They keep expanding over and over the same model.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:15:26
Sucks for BCH holders. They lost more than they would with BTC and no fork = hahaha
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:30:40
Show me da wae Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:06:30
Same here, went to buy something for $1,000 in btc had to add $150 on top of it since it went down -_-
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:59:40
You either hodl or get off my blockchain!
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:08:57
Except DBZ is over and now all the shills are selling.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:10:21
That's what she said.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:30:21
"where white man"
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:08:19
This is why you diversify
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:08:18
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:04:16
Even with bitcoin it can still be traced. Most people have to buy it legally so it's tied to you now. 90% of people go through some exchange like coinbase to buy so tell me how are we suppose to remain annonymous?
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:53:00
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:54:24
YOU SELL YOU LOSE!!! HODLLLL
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:08:52
wake up sheeple
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:52:35
Hence the 10%, but I'm just guessing with that.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:07:37
and 90% of people will still get traced. Where do you think they get it from to begin with? Exchanges so there's no anonymonity.
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:53:54
Would've add a nice touch if he used a pickaxe.
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:52:25
Heard they're switching to proof of wok
@_date: 2015-11-18 13:50:49
Gets risky though because if they bought it with a stolen CC I would assume you might be commiting fraud or be part of it someway.
@_date: 2015-11-18 13:49:14
That would seem to make more sense because btc you can't just get back. If that's the case were protected and the site should be in trouble?
@_date: 2015-11-18 13:54:48
Well damn it already happened. Even if it's Amazon it's still risky, but cheaper items like in the video might be okay. That's my 2 cents if you guys want to use it, but I'll opt out.
@_date: 2015-11-18 06:29:29
I still don't get it...Why would these people buy it with bitcoin cheaper for you? What do they profit off of? Sorry just confused
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:58:53
I brought ChipCoins
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:28:12
So what's the gain if it doesn't go to 0?
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:41:48
Too late now bruh
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:22:23
Sad a lot are doing that now a days. Who to trust?
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:42:28
Never trust a man who wears a hat inside.
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:34:36
YOLO BITCH
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:32:03
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:46:07

ETC doesn't have any use. Etherum is where it's at.

Everytime I say that I get downvoted. I think we have too many noobs joining thinking they know everything.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:07:35
Of course it didn't, but it's not needed.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:52:14
