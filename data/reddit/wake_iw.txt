I’m the extra type - bought in with disposable cash, invested badly so lost 50%, invested a bit better and now back at break even 
Planning on leaving the rest there as it will either bounce or burn by the end of the year

It could be that you’ve only ever shopped on a US based site so never needed to. 
My card is in Euro but if I purchase from Amazon UK I have the option to pay in EUR or GBP 
Choosing the EUR option means agreeing to the Amazon exchange rate whereas remaining in GBP means my bank will charge the exchange rate at that time. Generally not much difference on small purchases but can be on significant ones.

I’ve always treated gambling like investing - aiming for low gains on a regular basis. 
If team A is 1/10 to beat team B then most people shy away from the bet - those same people would happily take a 10% gain from a bank (or crypto) and claim it was free money. 
Sticking with sports you know and understanding the dynamics of the particular game (is it a “nothing game”/dead rubber etc. likely to field an weak team or is it a “must win” ) is key of course - as it is in investing. 
Using betting exchanges takes a bit of practice but opening a bet at 1.2 and closing when it hits 1.1 locks in your profit (“all green”) if you want to restrict your risk. 
I always described my approach as being shorter term with higher risk than normal investing - then I got into crypto and all of a sudden the bet I made yesterday for this weekends fixtures seems a lifetime away!

I’m sure there are better options but as I’m only new I took a recommendation and transferred my LTC and BTC direct to a new Bitstamp account and address.

This dude’s traded better than 99% of people in the current bear market to improve their position - deserves a bit more respect then dismissal for the method of measurement
