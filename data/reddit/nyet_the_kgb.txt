I believe we are getting our definitions from different places. Your definition is from investopedia while I got mine from wiki. 
So I'll concede that your definition is better and more correct. Congrats

Not really. It's made real by government decree but it could be backed by anything. If the government said the currency is backed by Twinkies in circulation, it's Fiat. 
The discrepancy is that fiat is essentially a derivative rather than *just* gold or whatever. 
But yes fiat nowadays is just backed by a central bank

I'm 7 min in and this guy knows how to communicate! But there's been a lot of speculation with bitconnect. It's a shame because I feel like the majority of people fucked over are the people who are new, uneducated in the subject, and probably will be the most vocal

Basically. Electrum-LTC which is a separate wallet
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:00:43
Yeah, it's the arguably most responsible thing to do haha

Prices differ per exchange. They tend to eventually come to similar prices but an echange sets the price of BTC, not some overarching entity

As applicable as rules in penny stocks

the whole point is no regulation.
Honestly probably once/if critical mass of adoption occurs, where hopefully no one can own enough to cause mass market movements. 
Whether or not that can or will happen is up in the air though

No, LTC is silver

Honestly it's a VERY easy thing to do if you do your research. Much more secure than relying on Coinbase to exist in 18 years or whenever your nephew would like to take our his currency. 
Just my thoughts. Just make sure you keep a backup of the paper wallet just in case it gets lost

Wish I could've gotten verified at some point haha

Market transactions (on the spot) can differ slightly depending on the current market price. That's why you have a lot of people recommending using gdax for stop orders to sell/buy at the price you want to.

Possibly, but then people who want faster transactions will pay more and people who set the lowest will get neglected. It averages off a little bit but yeah it's a bit frustrating

But no widget that I could find

What came first, the spike or the drop
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:06:39
Nah we've seen that. People can arbitrage between exchanges but txn times  are too long for anything meaningful a lot of the times

Reminds me in second grade where we took a field trip to the main paper in town and they gave us copies to proof and we found so much wrong.
