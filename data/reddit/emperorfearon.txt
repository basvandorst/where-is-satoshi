and are so fun to follow, just to watch how desperately you will throw shit at each other all the while being ignorant to the fact you're both covered in shit. Boo hoo, they call themselves Bitcoin. If your precious coin was so good then that wouldn't matter. Boo hoo, they strayed from the white paper. Then go and do your own thing and leave the others to it.
How about instead of making the entire community toxic how about you keep posts and discussion just on your "original" Bitcoin and leave the others to make their own mistakes instead of trying to look so superior.
And for the record, Bitcoin is completely different from what it set out to be and there's no interest in it now unless you're a reddit fan, a speculative investor, or a dev that wants to pretend they're changing the world.
Ban me like you do the others, downvote me all you want. But this is what an outsider that watches you guys think and there's plenty more people like me out there than there is petty posters like OP here. Think about how shitposts like this make you all look

Check my history, have I posted here OR No I haven't. I'm just someone that was hoping when I subscribed to see updates and conversation about Bitcoin. But if it came down to it I'd rather be a Bitcoin Cash troll any day when the alternative is to be part of an echo chamber that thinks Bitcoin will change the world while holding onto what you have and not using it as a currency as it was intended. But hey, that's just the opinion of someone who would've been interested in your precious currency but isn't any longer because its not even about change or technology. Its only about one currency coming out on top of the other and nothing else
Addition: BCH is no better, everyone that enjoys shitposts like this are childish and clearly are not here for the original purpose
