You've got some errant commas there. /s

With 'few' being the key word in that sentence. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:15:32
How is that even remotely comparable? You're referring to a time when the vast majority of wealth transfers and exchanges occurred via commodities (grains, livestock, tools, material, etc).

Woah, woah, woah... A *whole* marijuana?! Are trying to kill him?

Seems like a pretty fair estimate, given that reddit at large is already ~70:30
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:16:15
Has there been a poll of this sub conducted recently?
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:44:11


Sounds about right
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:34:35
That's a lot of debt, but I don't see anything about the state being bankrupt.

TTYTTER ftw.

I'd be willing to bet that if there was, it'd show roughly 95:5 male:female here.

What would be the point? There aren't nearly enough people who use bitcoin to support a large or diverse enough community that wouldn't very quickly devolve into a meaningless echo chamber of people patting themselves on the back for having bitcoin. From there, the community leaves from boredom and the sub dies.

I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not, but capitalism (at least the way we've constructed it since the industrial revolution) is fueled by debt.
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:58:18
You have that entirely backwards if you're trying to buy bitcoin futures from this guy.
@_date: 2015-05-01 00:09:39
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the Yuan needs to bump up another order of magnitude at least.

OP did not leave his car unlocked, and it actually is still theft in either case.
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:25:35
So I'm allowed to drive away with your car if you leave it parked on the street?
Apropos of absolutely nothing: where do you perchance live, and what kind of car do you drive? Just curious. I'm asking for a friend.
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:34:44


Then so is property not held in common.
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:43:49
Wait, are you saying that bitcoin is fundamentally insecure?
@_date: 2015-07-01 05:55:39
Good ol' How It's Made.
@_date: 2015-04-19 05:56:46
DAE AmeriKKKa?!
@_date: 2015-04-09 15:11:39
So are we just completely ignoring the theft tens of thousands of coin that has become a semi-regular occurrence?
@_date: 2015-03-11 14:47:48
At this point: [*crickets*]
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:36:59
~30 mins is a bit early for the crickets isn't it?
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:47:06
Everyone knows it's spelt "bit coin" anyway.
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:11:07
If nothing else, it is far more predictable, and that's one of the most important factors for a long-term business decision.
