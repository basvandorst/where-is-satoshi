Good question. To clarify cash is what is sent and received. Like Western Union, MoneyGram etc, only less expensive since it will be built on BTC rails. We will not have no custody over any of the funds or private keys.  More to come of course, however by launch we will be a venture backed company with a very public face and well known team. Hope that helps a bit, I edited the original post to reflect that better. 
Thank you.

I wish I could provide more info but we are not yet announcing publicly or launched. We are still in the research phase.

We will not have stores, it will be more distributed. The reason Bitcoin or many virtual currencies are good for remittances is because you can cut the cost of the remittance by cutting out the middleman, old antiquated systems, store overhead etc. A benefit we will provide is to make sure that people receive their cash that is sent to them, and that all parties can be trusted.

This can be accomplished without the holding of funds.
Localbitcoins is focused on the buying and selling of BTC.
We are focussed on providing on / off ramps to the BTC network into and from fiat and additionally matching people near each other to provide such an exchange. Similar but not the same focus.

We are more a matching service. We don't facilitate BTC to BTC. We will help people who need to send cash to family and friends. We use the bitcoin as the internet of cash not cash of the internet. Bitcoin is remittance on it's own. However there are many people in the world who don't have access. We would like to help bridge the gap and connect points otherwise not connected.

I just had a similar experience. I made two purchases. 12 domains in the second purchase I sent the payment and it did not apply to my account. NOW I CANT EVEN LOG IN OR RESET MY PASSWORD I have emailed the developer on here and waiting for a reply. I hope he responds. There is NO support listed. They have taken my money and it seems like no way to even access my account all in the same day. 
Namecoin.com Are you there??

I see that the state of Georgia yearly business filing for 2013 has not been done. I think it was late in April
