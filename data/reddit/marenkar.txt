The P2P project? The R&amp;D Team came up with it after looking at companies like Uber and how they changed their respective industries.

Thanks! We're trying to improve the site more though so hopefully no one complains about the load up time anymore. The devs are making some improvements this week together with the community portal.

Quick summary: It's a project with the goal to make things even easier when trying to acquire crypto locally with cash, debit card, and, in some areas, bank transfers, with this P2P ATM project. For local transactions, it will be similar to Uber in a way to make it easier to find someone to acquire crypto from as well as finding someone to sell it to, such as if you're traveling and need to acquire cash, and there's no BTC ATM in the area. This will also hopefully make it easier for those who want to get their first BTC or other tokens. A debit card charge or bank transfer for cash option will be an available feature as well. KYC/AML requirements will be satisfied, but will be kept at the minimum and will follow the tiered system similar with exchanges.

Sure!

Sorry about that. Passed on the feedback to them to try to get that part addressed.

Not sure if it's relevant these days since he doesn't (I think?) contribute to the Bitcoin code anymore, but I thought it might be interesting for some of the pioneer Bitcoiners.

No, they also sell some merchandise. 
I can attest to that. I bought a small barrel of vodka.

Thanks :)

I don't need a physical machine. They, in theory, don't need one. But why not make it even easier for them? 
Also, not really a whole lot of tech savvy people around where I live but are interested in something like this. They're just not really willing to put the time into it.

Man, I wish I learned about you guys before I set up the websites for my clients. Getting a .no domain and getting hosting for it was more difficult and expensive than I expected. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 12:52:27
Awesome, but do you guys actually sell the ATM? I already have easy access to buying BTC.

Thanks for the tips! I think I'll try to contact Mutocoin and try to see if I can work something out.
Cash would be better, but it would end up being the same thing as a debit card actually. With a debit card, I run the risk of them doing a charge back should they not get what they paid for. However, if they pay in cash and not get what they pay for, there would be formal complaints filed and I would have to shut down the ATM and refund that person anyway. I live in a small town (though touristy) at the moment so it's something that could very much happen. 
Also, we have one regular ATM in the entire town. It ran out of cash for 5 days and almost no one complained. Two of those days were the weekend though. 
Thanks for the heads up regarding the NFC one. I think that sounds pretty cool, but I would need the reader as the cards here do not have the NFC chip.

It's the new Coinye

What would be the justification behind Bitcoin being a store of value? Based on the argument of Litecoin being for everyday transactions, what would prevent users from using Litecoin instead of Bitcoin for the larger transactions?
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:16:58
I think this is the best way to go. We don't want to look like we're forcing it down their throats. Well, we aren't, but the public could perceive it to be that way. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:12:44
I think I'm going to start doing this now! Thanks for the idea.
