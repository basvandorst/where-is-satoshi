When I import ThomasV's public key I get
    gpg: Note: signatures using the SHA1 algorithm are rejected
    gpg: key 0x2BD5824B7F9470E6: 2 bad signatures
    gpg: key 0x2BD5824B7F9470E6: no valid user IDs
    gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
    gpg: key 0x22453004695506FD: 1 signature not checked due to a missing key
    gpg: key 0x22453004695506FD: 2 bad signatures
    gpg: key 0x22453004695506FD: no valid user IDs
    gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
    gpg: Total number processed: 2
    gpg:           w/o user IDs: 2
Unfortunately it's a SHA1 key (probably because it was made long ago).
The import is rejected because of my GPG restrictive configuration in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf :
    weak-digest SHA1
If I comment that line I'm able to import the key but I get two keys imported:
    gpg: key 0x2BD5824B7F9470E6: public key "ThomasV &lt;thomasv1 imported
    gpg: key 0x22453004695506FD: **1 signature not checked due to a missing key**
    gpg: key 0x22453004695506FD: public key "Animazing &lt;animazing imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 2
    gpg:               imported: 2
    gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
    gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
Who's Animazing?
I've been [digging around]( a little and Animazing seems to be an old Electrum contributor and his signature looks legit although it seems like his public keys was never signed by himself.
I don't support the choice of embedding the two keys in one file however if you are hesitating right after importing the key, as I was, know that it should be all good.
