Can't afford to try something else if you are living from hand to mouth :(

You got downvoted but you did tell a lot of truth there
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:03:49
There it is, easy come easy go :/

But if you're buying, aren't you part of the fear?

Didn't I just read they rented lambos for this conference? Seems like it's been an interesting place alright

As solid evidence as any really, she is a world wide influencer and a powerhouse just like all the others

But what about hodl? Die hard bitcoin fans don't have it to spend it

People are concentrating more about gainz than altruistic reasons tbh. Soon every other person is going to have their own crypto

If people are taking loans to buy bitcoin, they deserve all the bad stuff that comes their way. You don't take out loans to gamble.

What makes it unreasonable is the hodl mentality. This form of investing is risky indeed
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:48:52
This is only for people that don't know how to make money other ways. This is silly and sounds as reasonable as saying: start working for the lottery

Agreed but it took off precisely because of the frenzy and as we can see in this sub people that can't afford to pay rent got in too.
