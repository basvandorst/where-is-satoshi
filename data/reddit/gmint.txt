Developers are working hard to make Bitcoin more accessible to others. Some good examples: **BitPay**, **Mycelium** and **Electrum**.

You should if you want to save some money.

YOU COULD JUST USE **100 MILLIBITS** FOR 0.1 BTC &amp; **10 MILLIBITS** FOR 0.01 BTC.

What's wrong with microbitcoins (μBTC) and millibitcoins (mBTC)? Is it too confusing so we need to simplify it more into one sub-unit? 
Bit may also refer to the basic unit of information in computing so this would only create more confusion. 1 Byte = 8 bits.

4 years ago $1.00 USD = 1,392.33 BTC
We all wish we could go back in time and accumulate bitcoins as much as you can then wait for November 2013 to happen.

When I first heard of Bitcoin last year, I always thought it was a payment processor that needs to be installed in the user's PC in order to send and receive payments. I considered it as a joke and will never last since we already have web-based payment processors which are way more convenient, user-friendly and can process payments instantly. Then, everything changed ~~when the Fire Nation attacked.~~ after I spent some time reading more about it and visiting the communities. Everything became clear. It's not just a payment processor, it's more than that; a cryptocurrency. I was amazed by its high-end technology and higher level of security.
People need to give it some time before they make judgments. They could be missing a lot.

got it here  under security

**Secure digital payments at very low cost.**
* All transactions are secured by military grade cryptography.
* Lower transaction fee than credit cards &amp; payment processors (e.g. PayPal)
* No central authority or middleman (e.g. banks) to f$ck up the transactions by freezing or delaying it.
* Paying with Bitcoin is like paying with cash directly since it's P2P.
* You're identity is protected since it doesn't require any personal information just to make payments.
These are just some of the best features of this technology. Do some more research and you'll start to understand why we love Bitcoin.
