Yeah some german banks charge a lot when you withdraw at a different bank.
Other new "features" some banks introduced:
* Much higher monthly fees (even when you dont use the account once)
* Fees even when you withdraw at your own bank
* Not beeing able to withdraw less then 50€
* Higher fees when you whithdraw more then 3 times a month
* Fees outside of normal business hours
But its all good, we get our money back with our massive 0.1 % interest ;)

For every Bitcoin spend you can re-buy the same amount.
For small amounts of Bitcoin spend it doesnt matter that they are "gone" so you dont even have to to this often.

At some you have to yes.
We can enjoy some tax free bitcorn gains though if we hodl for a year.

yeah just yesterday there was an article about someone goin to jail for 2 years and ordered to forfeit his profits because of using localbitcoins.
The reason was: "operating an illicit and unlicensed money transmitting business"
I guess the number or amounts of trades that makes it a business is just arbitrary.
The EU just said f\*\*\* it and forced everyone to use KYC.

My favorite part is: 


You are automatically a criminal when you exchange crypto for fiat now ? Must be good to live in the land of the free :)

Its pretty ridiculous if you think about it.
Bitcoin is a currency, even when governments dont want to acknowledge that.
Imagine you withdraw money at a bank, you spend it for grocerys, they end up with someone buying a car....and after 137 transactions years later they are used for something illegal.
Then the first guy who withdrew the money is obviously at fault because he must still be the owner after 137 transactions ???

Estimated Annual Value of:
* Counterfeiting \~ $1 trillion 
* Drug Trafficking \~ $500 billion
* Human Trafficking \~ $150 billion
* Money Laundering by Banks $ ∞ 
Monero at  Marketcap at $1 billion .....  "fraud and theft is rampant"

innocent until proven guilty... unless the government is involved then just quickly reverse that, no big deal.

Its called a killer app. Americans are usually good at making them.
Coinbase already looks so much simpler and easier to use then others even though its worse on the inside.
Maybe look out how the chinese are doing it.
Something like 75% of people there buy stuff with their phone, even at some small crappy food stand.

I will never understand people who sell everything.
Even when you are absulutely certain to have guessed the top, just keep a little bit.
Or get back in later when you have been proven wrong to have guessed the top.

So when you get older you forget what a bitcoin is ? :)
The younger generation has to invent something better than Bitcoin to repeat the cycle.
With our generation having lived through every step of the modern Computer age its much more likely we will acknowledge when something better comes around.

Did I read this right, he wants to put 100 % of his savings into mining in Canada when even the Chinese are struggling and trying to get into Iran ?
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:42:32
No that was exactly my point. You just described a transfer of a currency, that can already be done in a simpler form.
The internet didnt just make things slightly better, it defined our whole generation and created a million possibilities that werent available before

1. Thats often the case in p2p exchanges isnt it. In Binance this would instantly be bought up by arbitrage bots or a gazillion daytraders.
2. Security deposits create incentives for both buyer and seller to  follow the rules of Bisq's trading protocol.
They are locked into multisig escrow along with the bitcoin being traded, and are returned to each user when the trade completes successfully.
If a trade goes to arbitration and one party is found to have violated Bisq's trading protocol, some or all of that party's security deposit may be awarded to the counterparty.
3. Bisq only supports payment methods which are known to make chargebacks difficult.
On Bisq, arbitrators determine solutions to trade disputes. Arbitrators must pay a very high [BSQ bond]( which ensures fair evaluations and prevents collusion with traders.
Once the arbitrator has clarified the situation, they will sign the  2-of-3 multisignature address in favor of the appropriate party.

Because they trade with fiat.
Dont replace one centralized platform with another, do it like Bisq.

The Internet was an upgrade to newspapers yes, but it has thousands of more use cases and absolutely transcended that medium.
With blockchains you have more use cases then just a currency, sure.
But almost everything you can do with blockchains you can do in a simpler or slightly worse form without it.
There is no way though for the newspaper to perform tasks slightly worse than the internet, its just so much inferior.

The internet was a revolutionary new thing that we have never seen before.
Bitcoin is an upgrade (even when it is a revolutionary one) to currencys that were around for thousands of years.
There are alternatives to Bitcoin, there is no alternative to the internet.

The whole point of Bitcoin is to have a p2p transfer of currency without the need to know the guy on the other end.
If you want someone in the middle that has all your info, the control of your funds and all the vulnerabilities and risk that comes with it, you might just use paypal.

I dont know specifics in other countrys so you have to research depending on where you live, but Fidor has partnerships with [bitcoin.de]( and [Kraken.com]( and you can even buy crypto in your account so it doesnt get more crypto friendly than that.
Edit: also there is always Bisq
@_date: 2019-04-12 11:45:45
Sure that one is an extreme example, but there are others with I think just 15 k.
The next arbitrary is the US legal system, get one judge and you are Pablo Escobar of the darknet, get another and you are free to go.
And in the end the whole business gets blocked for the country like Bitmex.

If that was an attempt by many of the most powerful people on this earth, it was pretty miserable.
Not accepting, trash-talking and aggressively working against their own invention for the whole 10 years of its existance was trying to get me to use it ?

Why did you not post his other quotes ?
"bitcoin won’t be the dominant system."
 "We need things that draw on the revolution of bitcoin, but bitcoin alone is not good enough."
 “As an asset class, you’re not producing anything and so you shouldn’t expect it to go up. It’s kind of a pure ‘greater fool theory’ type of investment,” 
 “I agree I would short it if there was an easy way to do it,” 
 someone once gave him some bitcoin for his birthday, but he sold it a few years afterward.
