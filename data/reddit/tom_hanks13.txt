Did you read my response? I asked you to not prove it with charts because charts are open to interpretation and literally the fifth word in your response is chart. 
Everyone knows OKcoin fakes volumes. Their actions are proof of it. When they first started manipulating volume in 2013 they were called out on it and their volume changed within hours. I don't see the same with stamp, nor have I seen see actions from them that hint otherwise. 
I don't mean to come off as nasty, but I am a skeptic and right now your evidence just seems in line with someone who has a theory and is trying to add legitimacy by posting comments on professional looking charts.
You have formed your own opinion from the charts information. I just don't think your analysis is correct. 
Do you have any evidence outside of your interpretation of charts?

Gox was supposed to have close to 1 million coins when they failed, correct? How many coins are we talking about for these three "outrageous" claims? 200k per claim? 
@_date: 2015-12-25 16:38:25
"Bitstamp volumizer, well documented, Started around the end of August."
Source please. Putting the claim of "well documented" is the type of verbiage people use when they want others to believe their hard to prove personal conspiracy theories. 
There is absolutely fuckery going on the Chinese market and to some extent on Stamp. I don't think it is as big as what you are trying to make it out to be. 
Prove me wrong through "well documented" individuals claiming responsibility, or verifiable evidence. Not some random snippets of charts that is open to multiple interpretations. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:39:35
No one was fooled that GOX was solvent when people couldn't withdrawal fiat for months just like no one is fooled that certain Chinese exchanges are faking volume. Faking volume and faking volume aren't the same, but both only hurt Bitcoin in the longterm.

I know the difference between wallets and addresses it was just a mistype which caused this to go down a completely different road lol. 
You bringing up auto-clicking until you have 1.2 million addresses was exactly the point I wanted to make though. I wanted to know if it was 1.2 million wallets or 1.2 million addresses. Sounds like its the former, but you get the point to why this sub rightfully gets a bad rap when it comes to noobs.

Sigh, we've been over this 1000000X before too. 
The 0% exchange fee gets way more credit than what they deserve. Yes, 0% fees will promote trading to very high levels. However, when trading occurs in very predictable manners that amount to almost no profit between the buyer/seller something is going on. When trading patters that defy free market rational trading go on for months, something is going on. [When exchanges get called out on this and suddenly their trading patters drastically change, something is going on.](

You will be fine. People get pretty crazy when they talk about  cold storage, but you should be fine as long as you periodically check to make sure that none of them have failed.

They can have all the potential in the world, but if the exchanges are faking data than this does not help bitcoin at all. Do you seriously not see a problem with this? 
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:18:37
Right, 0% fee will mean more trading. No one is arguing that. What is suspicious is that right after people started accusing them of faking data there volume suddenly drops off. Then, at almost the exact same time, they introduce 0% trading. The two by itself mean nothing. However, given the circumstances of these exchanges and the timing it certainly arises suspicion.

What I got from that was that you aren't used to guns and are afraid of them. Being afraid of something does not warrant them being banned. 
 If you are afraid of dogs, flying, different opinions should those be banned too? I am taking those arguments to the extreme, but you get the point. Just because you don't like something or are not used to something does not give you the right to impose your beliefs on others. Especially when they were written into the framework of the country.

Here is the article that got the discussion going. 
During this last BTC boom, a few Chinese exchanges essentially popped up out of nowhere and were trading the same or more BTC than some of the biggest exchanges in the world. China does have a lot of people, but what was fishy was no BTC seemed to be coming out of the major exchanges. It led people to ask, how can China have all of this volume when very little, if any, of the BTC actively traded was taken out of the normal exchanges? People started calling them out on this and suddenly the Chinese exchanges trading volume plummeted, hinting that they had been caught. 
 Around that time they also started putting in 0% trading fees. What this led to was lots of bot buying their own orders. This made it seem like there was lots of volume, but there really wasn't "real trading" going on. It was very shady that all of this stuff happened at the same time. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 14:01:02
Why is it that someone makes a thread where they don't know what going on and then also immediately assumes its bots? If you don't know what it is then don't also use it a time to make a dig at bots.
To answer your question, I don't know what is going on.

Ask a question in get downvoted lol. Certainly doesn't help the push for this sub to be friendlier to noobs. Either way, I do know the difference and worded that incorrectly. 
My point still stands though. When buying X amount of bitcoin on coinbase it automatically creates a new bitcoin address. I was just asking the question whether those 1.2 million are actually wallets(unique person) or if they are 1.2 million addresses that coinbase controls.

@_date: 2014-09-25 00:18:47
Exactly. Current price of BTC is $411. $411 x 10 = $4110 (this is your cost basis) 
 If BTC hit $100,000 and you sold all of those BTC it would be $1,000,000 - $4,110 = $995,890 that you pay taxes on.
Assuming you held these for longer than 1 year, it would be a long term capital gain and the rate varies by state. If you lived in the California you would be paying 33% of all you earned to the state 
If however, it was short term capital gains you are looking closer to paying over 50% of whatever you made to state and federal

I'm pointing out the fallacy of him asking what is going on and then going on to say its bots. Whether or not it is bots it is clear that he doesn't know what is going so therefore it must be bots. They have become the crypto whipping boy. 
I actually do think there is some bots play going on here, but it is not the sole driver. I know how bots work and this is not the typical patterns I have seen. There are other factors here. 
If the price stays the same and volume keeps doing what it has been the previous few hours then it is more bot induced. If the price continues to fall and we see more of the same volume then it is should be clear that bots were not the main contributing factor.

I think it is fair to say everyone in are advocates of free market. When an exchange is accused of faking trading it is also upon those actively participating in a free market to call out this manipulation. If we allow exchanges to say they have more BTC than what they actually have, we have lowered ourselves to the same system of fractional reserve banking which are supposed to be fighting. 
 You can say I'm against "free market", but all it really is a strawman for those who don't understand how a market is supposed to work. This is an argument from someone who would rather see corruption that enables them to make a quick buck short term rather than someone who would want to see the longevity of the Crypto revolution. I would rather see free market prosper than make a quick buck off manipulation.

I agree and know where you are coming from. I really didn't have too much of a problem with dogecoin up until recently when I tried to bring up some of my criticisms with the reward schedule. 
What I noticed is something similar to what I see in People will go out of their way to make sure that whoever is debating you, no matter how illogical their points may be, to upvote them simply to make it look like your opinion is not what the majority thinks. 
My criticisms never got negative downvotes, but they always started out with more upvotes than the person I was debating. A few hours later I would come back to my post to find that it was close to 1 upvote followed by a slew of people from who received 20+ upvotes in a sub that rarely gets more than 5 upvotes per comment. Kind of conspiratorial, yes, but certainly an oddity that caught my attention. 
It just really leads me to believe there are people out there who have so much invested in dogecoin that they will resort to questionable tactics to keep appearances. I can't support a coin like that. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:24:27




Except that is exactly how they do it. If you buy X amount of bitcoin on one day and buy X amount the next they will show up under two addresses. They are not sent to the same address. If you go to account settings you can see all of your bitcoin addresses. 
This is the problem. Not that votes really matter, but your response actually is wrong and is misleading, yet yours has upvotes and my main question has downvotes because it was deemed "misleading" when it actually brought up a question that people didn't know the answer to. 
This is about as clear of an example of how this sub treats “noobs” as it gets.

Going to take an extremely wild guess here and call this FUD to get people to panic sell litecoin. 9 million litecoins being sent to one address screams someone recycling coins and sending LTC to their own address to make it look like everyone is sending coins there.

It will be these 50K BTC and another ~44K BTC at some point in the future

I'd be willing to bet that the winning bids are well above market price. If you were a bitcoin buyer to begin with, you are probably willing to pay a bit of a premium if it gives you publicity. Tim Draper got the spotlight and is now well known in the bitcoin community. Second market tried to win all of them the second time around but Tim Draper won the one block and stole the ability for Second Market to say they won the entire auction.

It's actually not delayed indefinitely. Sometime around September is when payments will be made to Gox users. 
at 29:20 he mentions September

I know what you are saying. On the flip side, if you were btc-e you wouldn't want to be the one who is responsible for selling stolen coins. 
I see both sides and I don't know how I would approach this if it happened to me

My withdrawal was processed just fine. Not a huge amount of coins, but not negligible either.

@_date: 2015-02-07 17:18:09
And what happens to the coins?
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:51:03
Think it's just doing what bitcoin does. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 17:35:13
Thanks, seems like they are pointing to September

His fraud ultimately benefited the dogecoin community though. He pretty much bankrolled their fund raising efforts using stolen funds, which got them a lot of publicity. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:34:46
Very interesting. Thank you 
@_date: 2015-02-07 17:14:40
They still control coins. Some of that has to come back at some point 
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:06:16
Yeah, he was full 100% in politician mode. I guarantee he knows next to nothing about how bitcoin actually works

I remember this post too, but I haven't been able to find it for months now. It was really well written, and like you said offered a very reasonable explanation of what the willy bot actually was. It wasn't too much different than how coinbase will sometime buy more than the $50K USD worth of bitcoins for "whales". 
The explanation was pretty boring and settled a lot of conspiracies regarding willy bot. Really wish I could find that post...

I have heard this before. Why is it staged? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:23:00
Where was this when BTC was skyrocketing? So much misinformation everywhere a month ago. Seems to me people only want circlejerk in this sub. 
@_date: 2013-10-12 14:10:30
Sure he is not trying to scam you?
@_date: 2013-08-20 03:34:37
What percent of that graph is still GPU? 
@_date: 2013-08-15 04:49:54
I made this comment in reply to someone trying to use the tulip argument 
@_date: 2013-08-29 23:10:03
Everyone was saying there must be good news at the BTC foundation meeting when the prices shot up on Mt Gox. I was one of the few saying that it was bad news and people were trying to get their BTC out while the still could. If I had BTC in Mt Gox I would pay the premium and higher costs to get out while you still can. At the very least get some of it out.

The only thing that ever came close to this was during the last presidential election when someone tried to blackmail Romney stating they hacked his tax return. They wanted like 1 million bitcoins or something. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 02:03:19
They did. Just basically said that you are exchanging the paper that is physically (in this case digitally) backed up like gold is for GLD. In a lot of ways this is actually more versatile than most ETFs out there. This really does have potential. If this goes through and is timed right, I can't believe I'm saying this, but we might see $1,000+ per BTC 
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:22:48
Hearing news like this only improves my opinion on bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:12:46
Lets not forget this is the same guy who got behind quarkcoin. He tends to make these announcements after he gets skin into them. Not disagreeing with him, just take it FWIW 
@_date: 2013-08-22 00:44:33
My guess this is due to GOX and the fact that BTC-e servers went down for maintenance. For awhile withdrawals were down which resulted in some pretty significant panic once it was back up 
@_date: 2013-10-20 16:55:30
This is what they did during bank runs during the great depression. The banks had next to no money, yet would keep one teller open and hand out money as slowly as they could. People in line would see others leaving with money and think that the bank still had their money and give up trying to get their money out. 
Its a double edged sword what the government did to GOX. On one hand they made it so people cant retrieve their money. By doing this, they also made it so no major sell off could occur since people could not get money out resulting in a very stable price of BTC.
