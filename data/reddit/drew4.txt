On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 5.  If the implementation goes smoothly I'd move it up to 8.   I'm actually quite skeptical of many bitcoin projects but having shares traded on the blockchain with permission from the government is a big deal.  How big of a deal will now be determined by the quality of the implementation.  Making trades settle within minutes instead of days is a huge trading bonus.  Also, no more naked short selling!

Bitcoins don't magically become "invalid" with a fork unless you lose your private keys.  
The "new" systems would simply be another chain with different sized blocks that inherits all the old bitcoins from today's system.  You may have two new blockchains (this is the split), but the coins could be spent on either one or not at all.

You'd lose a ton in small dollar increments due to Paypal and Bitcoin network charges.  Also, there is the risk that Paypal reverses the charges, cancels, and/or freezes accounts associated with the trades (likely against policy).
However, the idea of breaking the trades down into smaller verified units makes perfect sense as a risk mitigation strategy.

I like what you have to say about good block explorers being open source.  Because my curiosity couldn't be contained, I built one myself quite a while ago.  It's functional and drops everything into a SQL database for easy analysis.  But man, it was **a lot of work**, so I can appreciate the expertise and effort that goes into such a project.  So yes, we're probably looking at "the long run" for nice open source versions.
That being said, I'm not sure people building things for the sake of being acquired is entirely healthy.  I would rather see people build viable businesses and stick with them without any expectation of a buyout.  Making a quick buck can provide incentive, but it limits the staying power of a business concept unless the new owners know how to manage it (rarely true).
I could be wrong (certainly wouldn't be the first time!) but I think that the most successful businesses created during the .com bubble were created by people who continued to run and own the business regardless of the business environment rather than sell out.
My humble 2 cents. ;)

I don't think acquisition by Coinbase is a good thing at all because it's sucking up another independent company in the Bitcoin space.  For a good Bitcoin ecosystem, we need as many companies (and competitors) within the marketplace as possible.
If Coinbase likes bitlicense regulations (which I don't know for certain), it's likely because they have "first-mover" advantage and capital.  They can afford to jump through the regulatory hurdles that would cripple other potential competitors.

I'm sorry, Coinbase is in no way at fault here, and it's unreasonable for you to expect them to change their front-end systems for your convenience because you couldn't manage your banking account balance.
If you disagree with how this matter was handled you should review the Coinbase User Agreement where it says:
**"We may resubmit debits or charges to your payment methods until all amounts owed by you to us hereunder are satisfied in full."**
Nowhere in the user agreement does it say they have to do any additional notification to you while attempting to collect payment or display notices on their website under your account.  
You are fortunate that they are not charging penalties like some retailers do - you in essence wrote a bad check that bounced!

You can export the private keys from Armory **without** letting it finish loading and processing the blockchain.  I sped things up a bit with my Armory wallet exports by disconnecting the Internet before starting up Armory (no blockchain to load if it can't get to the Internet).  You can keep the private key(s) anywhere, and load them onto most clients.  Export options in Armory are very flexible.
I personally like the light client "Mycelium" on my phone, YMMV.

Yes, but for a tiny fraction of the 21 unit's cost you could do the same with a Raspberry Pi.  
A Raspberry Pi costs about $30.  A pimped out version of the Pi (power supply, case, WiFi, storage card) will add up to about $70.
When you supply a keyboard, mouse, and monitor it becomes a bit more, but most of us have this stuff lying around.
However, for the cost of the 21 (or less), you could get a higher-performing laptop/netbook with everything included.

Merchant here...
Volatility is usually unimportant as bitcoins are converted instantly into our local currency by intermediaries.  Sort of how Visa or Amex allows you to purchase in a foreign currency, but you continue to deal in dollars (or whatever).
The only thing that should effect merchant acceptance is the interest consumers have in bitcoin, and whether or not the people with bitcoins can afford our services based on local exchange rates.

The guidance is still murky as the IRS hasn't released any specific information.  It appears as if bitcoin to dollar conversions are likely to be treated as a "realizable event" (ie. taxable).  
In this case, the basis (cost) is subtracted from your sale to determine your net profit (or loss).  You are taxed on the net profits as capital gains.  Capital gains are considered short-term if the bitcoins were held for less than one year, and long-term if held longer.  Long-term capital gains have a preferential tax rate.
The basis/sale is likely using the first in-first out methodology, as the alternative is difficult to elect with the IRS.  So if you buy 5 bitcoins and sell 4, the first 4 bitcoins you bought are the basis (cost) of the bitcoins you sold, not the last 4 you bought.
If there is no profit, losses are likely subject to "wash sale" rules and loss limits.
If the coins were mined, you might be able to add the cost of the mining to your basis (cost) but it would be difficult to justify to the IRS unless you could convince them it was a full-time business pursuit and not just a hobby.  Typically, mined bitcoins would probably be considered $0 cost.
All of this would be reflected on IRS schedule D.  Documentation of purchases and sales might be a good thing to have in case of audit.  It's likely that exchanges and services like Coinbase are sharing purchase/sale information with the government even if they are not providing much formal documentation for taxes.
Unless the IRS indicates otherwise, I'm doing my taxes this way.  I feel this is the safest and most conservative approach.
Not an accountant, but I've been "reading up" for my own nefarious purposes as a bitcoin miner/holder/seller.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:06:35
There's quite a bit of difference between state sales tax on the Internet, and capital gains and income taxes.  The states all handle sales tax enforcement (barely), but the federal government can come down on someone like a ton of bricks if they fail to disclose income like capital gains.
Exchanges will almost certainly share transaction information with the government.  If they don't, they will be shut down and assets will be seized (like the past shutdown of Mt. Gox).
Remember the IRS can go after you for 6 years (in some cases longer) if you fail to report income.  Willful tax evasion is a criminal, not just civil offense, and can include jail time.  At the very least, you could be looking at asset forfeiture, fines, and wage garnishment...
Unfortunately, fairness has nothing to do with it.
TLDR; Pay your taxes to the best of your ability.  Create your own documentation to do so if needed.  Otherwise, you could be really screwed.
