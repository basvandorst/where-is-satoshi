They are not lol! We pay with debit card almost for everything, cash is scarce because banks will only give out 10000 per day ( a break fast can cost you about 4000)

I can ship it to you if you are in the US! But theres a thing with bank notes... banks can only give out now 10000Bs per day per costumer, so there's is very little cash on the street, and because everyone needs it people are starting to "sell" money in cash for a % (ranging from 10% to %20) of the money you will need.
Say you need 100.000 then you must then paid to them 120.000 via wired transfer

A very nice hotel for a single person may cost you between 30000 and 80000 per night, and a meal at the very best restaurants may cost you between 8000 -15000 (with wine and steak)

I can send you one box via DHL!

You can! I know friends on college that are starving and can only eat once a day only!  a family with a minimum wage will be literally just surviving... Rents go from 50.000 to 600.000
3 meals at home for one couple and two sons will be about 10k or more per day... 
My gf family were really struggling and I was helping her and her mom paying for food and etc, now thanks to God her father got a job and her mom is finally seeing a light at the end of the tunnel in her businesses

Hey! I can via DHL! But only 100bs and maybe 50bs notes, the others one(2, 5, 10, 20) can't buy literally anything lol 
@_date: 2016-12-04 04:30:07
These are 20, and 10 notes! Since they are worth jack shit these are not being printed for a long time! So they have circulated for at least 6 months

I know that is not on world news, but crime rate is pretty fucking high in here... More than 30 ppl are getting killed DAILY here by criminals  (and you wonder what is war?) Human life here is getting so fucking underrated it's so fucked up! You can't walk om streets past 5pm, you must be almost paranoic if you are shopping for food or at the mall if you don't want to get robbed or killed for a phone!
