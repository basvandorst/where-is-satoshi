Someday people will learn that price drives the news.

Yup! I got in almost a year ago, but you see the cycle happen again and again. Everyone who bought at 19+ will be gravy after January 
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:45:08
this lol it amazes me people still don't understand btc. you don't need to worry about sending to another country. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:51:38
lol this
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:42:19
yeah, fees will decrease and congestion will get better. You might have to wait a week two to make a transaction though. When will it get better? Soon...maybe...or not.

i'm on 3 days with a 32 dollar fee.  i don't understand btc anymore

I will send you a small amount of coin for your troubles sir. Looking forward to christmas.

I moved 1 k for $32 and have had 0 confirms in 30 hours. WTF...
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:29:11
I paid 30 a couple days ago and I have 0 confirmations lol wtf bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:34:37
not even close to being true. Sent .057 btc yesterday with .002 fee (32 bucks) and it's been over 24hours because of the backlog.  Had a friend send bch 2 hours after me and it went through in minutes. BTC is broken.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:57:53
you paid a higher fee than .002 (32 usd)   on a .0005 transfer?    
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:19:12
that's pure speculation. This week only? So Roger is going to stop next week? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:25:46
I did a .002 fee and still waiting 3 days. Good luck op. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:47:21
what a joke. until some distant point in 2018 you won't be able to transfer btc in less than a week or for less than 30 dollars. Scaling issues have reached a critical point and are failing. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:51:16
it will be in limbo for weeks. I'm on day 3 with a 30 dollar fee.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:45:53
makes me understand why my  $32 fee wasn't enough 3 days ago... the one time I use btc to send and this is going on. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:31:30
Mine wasn't as lucky :(
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:52:41
The price drives the news not the other way around. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:28:32
same. isn't waiting multiple days the reason we're getting away from banks?  There are fundamentals that are being forgotten during all the bitcoin hype. I'd take 7k btc if I could transfer it without waiting a week. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 03:18:06
lolol guess not
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:37:28
this. most coins are just buy and hodl because "itll go up someday" and no one thinks about how they can actually use an ETH token.
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:38:50

I've been withdrawing the maximum amount each day since they updated their terms. It doesn't help that it's been 4 months and I'm still only tier 1.

I get what you mean. It's like the currency exchangers in different countries at the airport. 10% is ridiculously high. 1% would be manageable.

Why does this make people bullish? You do realize the more the price goes up the more his will be worth, right? Which means he can sell more and more at the high and dump it again
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:15:11
they don't need to. people buy things from them so they'll collect btc like they'll collect dollars.

It's okay if it's out of place. I was asking a yes or no question on whether he would prefer dividends with it or not. NOT how they would be worked in. It's yes or no question. I'm curious as to what people would prefer. The other stuff I never asked, but it is worth exploring like I mentioned a reply above. 
So can no one answer that question? Would you like monero even more if it had dividends?  It's yes or no lol  I would prefer a monero type coin that collected dividends. Anyone else?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:59:32
You didn't even reply to what I was saying. My point is that something else will.  Wouldn't you rather have a coin for offshore wealth storage that ALSO gets dividends?  It's everything you're asking for plus more. Isn't Monero + dividends better than just Monero?
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:29:32
No it's not a dash thing. It was just a question.   The hack thing and the other reply I got were good. 
What if you didn't have to have an online wallet? What if the coins were locked in on the ledger and that address just collected?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:11:42
It doesn't incentivize holders or have a marketplace.  Why not get dividends AND have a marketplace? Something will come along and offer both while Monero falls. 
EDIT:  If you downvote please post why you don't believe a system that offers what Monero does PLUS dividends and a market won't be better. Discourse is welcome.
EDIT 2:  It's a yes or no question.  Monero plus dividends or just Monero.

He was talking about the forum posts.

Does that include the rockets to mars?
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:38:14
lol you quoted "it doesn't incetive hoders"   you didn't say whether you wanted Monero or Monero and dividends. That's my question. It's a pretty simple yes or no.     Where they come from is a different question worth exploring. I just want to know if you want Monero and dividends or just Monero. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:43:35
What if there were two coins? Like neo and gas?  Gas would be the currency and Neo obviously collects the dividends. That way the currency could be mined and kept stable
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:41:36
exactly so that'll be the next fud and he'll have an even larger wallet to play with assuming everyone remains bullish. Why get hyped up for a guy with that many bitcoin to sell it at the top?
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:50:11
haha explain

I'm not trying to argue and I understand what Monero is... don't need to be a dick.. But what if there was another coin that offered what monero does (not an exact clone obviously) plus dividends?  It's not pointless. It's like asking if you'd like a red unicorn or a blue one. It's a just a question.  A yes or no would work.  So yes or no?

Well you were saying I didn't understand Monero when I was asking about a fictional privacy coin that was obviously not Monero. It was a yes or no question and all I got were rude replies from everyone. Maybe the dividends would come from the sales the coins were used for?

Isn't that what a tax is though? People use dollars and a portion goes to the gov.   If it was attached to a market like sys or bay how about then?

this. probably the same people that don't think Zuck is in bed with the gov as well. Corporations have become their own 3 letter agencies.

true, but most of us have learned to look both ways before crossing the street ;)
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:20:26
Crypto has a very steep learning curve lol. If you're not smart about things you're going to have a tough time. This doesn't help the average person, but that's only because the average person will not take the time to educate themselves. I do believe money should be simple and easy for all to use, and I do believe we should help those who don't know any better. That being said though at the end of the day you have to take the responsibility to educate yourself. If not you should stay away from crypto until it is more accommodating or until such things are in place.
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:07:46
Who said anything about predicting the market for 24 hours? Are you alright in the head? I was just pointing out there are obvious times not to be using btc for a transfer of wealth. Of course even if you look both ways a plane could crash lol

The split (which wont happen) and the scared money is heading into litecoin to wait out the storm. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:06:22
I never understood that. How is that possible? you either buy or you sell. I understand losing money on margin trading, but in this game you either have fiat or bitcoin. Try not to sell at a loss. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:12:52
I didn't say it wasn't... I'm just sayin what I see. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:38:23
So how does that work? If I send my BTC from one to the new wallet doesn't that mean all my coins from the original wallet will be in the new one? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:04:46
This and be sure to have a list of fundamentals that need to be fulfilled before you make a trade ie never buying at ath, betting that you're wrong, etc

Hey, just some friendly advice, fire proof safes are only "safe" for so long. A long enough/hot enough fire can still reach the contents inside. Might I suggest carving it into a brick inside the safe lol 
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:46:16
Kraken has no support. They're having the same issues as coinbase and poloniex. NO customer support are available to help because of the "backlogs. Gemini is the only one I haven't heard major issues with. If you use any of the exchanges expect 2 month long waits on your issues if you're lucky. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:00:56
That's great, but can they reopen customer service? 
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:54:11
Coinbase is a scam! There is no customer support. Spam  on twitter. I've been talking to him and he says he has no idea when anyone will be helped. Meaning wait times of over 2 weeks are nothing new. They do not care about you. They are just stealing your money. Please inform jesse of that when you talk to him.  
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:34:47
