As a brilliant entrepreneur, he probably has a better understanding of what a reasonable amount to risk would be than most random strangers giving their advice would have.

If mining is unprofitable today, then it's never the best way to get bitcoins.
If it costs X to mine 1 bitcoin, then X will buy me more than 1 bitcoin. I should just buy bitcoin.

You can buy BTC from an exchange.
Coinbase is a great place to start.

I used to enjoy playing Starcraft and Warcraft 3.
One way I can see bitcoin and/or blockchain changing things is like this:
Blizzard attaches "bounties" to certain ladder games. Winners of those games, or user who achieve in-game awards or medals are rewarded with an (probably very small) amount of BTC.
It's already REALLY addictive to play, but what if you were actually earning something to play? It would be like gaming crack IMO.

But how do you use bitcoin without touching some sort of device? Computer keyboards are often very dirty.

Yes, you could set up bounties in USD.
But if a game company is giving away $1 or less for completing achievements or winning a difficult ladder match, it would be more costly to process the payment than the value of the reward.
Bitcoin could make micro-prizes possible.

I like bitcoins!

OP didn't ask: "What are bitcoins benefits?"
He asked (paraphrasing): "What are bitcoins benefits to ME?"
As of right now, the benefits for the average consumer are very few.
As OP pointed out, CCs are currently better in almost every way.
This will most likely change over time, but for now, the answer is that you should probably keep your CC.

Could you provide more a little more information, before I take the time to write a poem for a stranger? 
Who are you and what is the video for? How will my poem be used? Is there any reward for being chosen, or simply recognition?
