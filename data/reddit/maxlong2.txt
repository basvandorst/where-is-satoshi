You (customer) get your money back. Scammer keeps the bitcoins. Seller, who is at fault because he did not know/check his customer well enough, is out of his bitcoins and receives no money.
This is not a gift from your bank.

You are so funny. How old are you? 12, 14?
There may be no specific regulations on crypto in some countries, but it does not mean there are no regulations anywhere. (I am not sure you can understand this sentence) In most places, crypto falls under existing regulations such as consumer protection laws.
As a seller, when you start your own e-commerce (like Coinbase), you don't just start collecting the credit card numbers of your customers in an Excel spreadsheet and bring it to your bank each week. You make a contract with a Payment Services Provider and you integrate your website with their systems.
And you know what my friend? Most payment services provider won't make a contract because they aren't interested into cryptocurrencies, others because they don't know you and you are very small and not too smart, and the very few who will accept will ask you to sign a contractual clause that in case of a fraud or a chargeback, you, the sell, will return the money. (and it is a standard clause they will use with every type of seller, be it cryptocurrency or not)
And that, my funny friend, is the reason the seller takes the loss and most cryptocurrency sellers don't accept credit cards because it is way too easy to charge back a credit card.

In the case you describe, you call your bank, they block your credit card and reverse all the transactions you did not do yourself. Like they have been doing for decades now. The bitcoin seller does not get your money and that's it.

You can call me an idiot how much you like but that does not make you correct. With credit card fraud the seller always end up eating the loss - be it with cars, groceries or bitcoins. The bank - or the payment service provider - recovers its money from the seller.

And give/receive USD/EUR in cash? It sounds dangerous and also a good way to break regulations in many countries. I can buy 100 KEUR worth of bitcoins from you legally with a bank transfer - and you can sell them to me this way too and it is legal. Not so much in cash. Plus it's a lot of work to exchange cash.

No it isn't done 100% automatically. Banks are worried about fraudulent transfers (where the sender did not approve the transaction) and fake identities (even if the sender is from another bank). If you receive a payment from Frank A M (a very short last name) from Germany or an homonym of a sanctioned person you may receive an inquiry from your bank and that isn't automated.

All EU countries have to require/offer a similar license by early 2020. I suppose if you get such a license in, say France, then you are covered for Germany.

OR the recipient is lying and it's a scam
