What happens if one votes YES and one votes NO? All I know is that there can't be a tie, and this is the final decision date.. no more delays

Why not just use Augur or some other prediction market?

Question: How much do you know about Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies (as an industry) from 1-10? if you know only basics but don't follow the space closely daily, then i would say don't do it. 
I work full-time in the space, and actually considered doing the same at some point, but then decided to just invest portion of my paycheck in it, versus taking out a big loan. But here is what I think:
1. Investing in cryptocurrencies is NOT equivalent to gambling: Yes, it is risky, and yes you should know why you are putting your money in it (have an investment strategy) but cannot be compared to playing a roulette for example. Also note that investing is different from trading.. but seems that you got that one right, because you are thinking of a 3-year horizon.
2. I (and no one) can guarantee you that Bitcoin price will be higher 3 years from now. I think it will, but there is a lot of uncertainty. But i can tell you this - Cryptocurrencies ( and decentralization more generally) as a movement are not going anywhere. They will be around 3 years from now, and they will be growing.  If Bitcoin fails, it will not be because cryptocurrencies / open blockchains are a failure and don't work, but because of some other reasons, and some other crypto will take over. So even if you do decide to take a loan and to invest in crypto - DIVERSIFY. but diversify smartly -  there is a lot of shitcoins and shit project out there, and this goes back to my first question - do you know what you are doing? If yes, invest smartly, diversify (be ready to re-balance your portfolio from time to time) and you will not fail!

Then I really dont understand! lol
I thought the keypad layout is the pin! that seems to be the only authentication that is required when im connecting my trezor device to my computer...
Not sure I know my PIN...what should I do next?
Thanks a lot for your help!

Thanks! 1) yes they will need a PIN, but if the PIN is generated by and displayed on the Trezor device, and the thief is in the possession of the device, then what's the point of requiring a PIN?! I know I'm missing something, because this cannot be the case

Omg this is embarrassing and I will be deleting this post soon, but this what happened:
I did not realize that I have to set  up a random PIN and that then Trezor gives me the keypad layout to type that PIN. What I thought was that I need to input numbers in order using the "secret" layout that the trezor is displaying. I.e. I thought that the squares you press are the secret sauce, not the number that you are effectively typing in. And because this is what i thought, not only did i set up my PIN to 123456789, but I i was also able to use it everytime without knowing it. 
Thanks all for the answers guys, I changed my PIN now, and this all makes A LOT more sense. Kind of embarrassing, but hey, I learned something new. Peace and keep hodling!
