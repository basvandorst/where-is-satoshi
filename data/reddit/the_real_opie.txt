You send the coins to the public key.
Public keys are your receive address.  It's safe to send that to anyone and everyone.
Private keys are your spend address.  Whoever has access to that private key has access to the coins associated with that address.
Edit: sounds like you're getting tripped up by coinbase's UI.
If you've purchased btc, ltc, or eth, and it's currently available from them, then navigate to the "accounts" tab.  There you can see your wallets.  From there you can choose to send and receive.

By the way, this is why hodl is the recommended strategy. 
You're hardly the first person to do this, and you won't be the last.
Some of us have been hodling for five + years.  We've seen gamblers come and go.
You aren't going to be able to consistently time the market.  It's just not plausible.  So buy what you can afford, relax, and hodl.

I can't speak for everyone but for me, I hoped it would be a usable currency when I first got into it years ago.
It used to be one.  I bought lots of shit with btc.  If I had just held it instead of using it to buy things, I'd be a millionaire.  Literally.
I still believe it has legitimate store of value purposes.  And it could become a currency again, there's lots of tech promises waiting in the wings which could restore that functionality.  But I rather suspect another Altcoin will fill that slot and insert itself for that use case before bitcoin manages to do so.  
And I'm OK with that too.

Is that Irish place still taking it?

I live very near here, so this was kinda neat.
Upon further investigation though, it seems most of the businesses have suspended their acceptance of BTC because of a stalemate with Ohio's liquor licensing bodies.

But I come from a culture of responsibility, where its generally considered advisable to propose alternatives when you have a complaint.  Sometimes you can't, either because there isn't one or you're not sufficiently knowledgeable, but when that occurs you ought to note as much in your spiel.  
You did neither, and got snotty when I asked for you to elaborate.  That's when you became a bit of a prick.
At this point I'm about ready to remove the "a bit" portion though.

Yup.  If you send your coins to a bitcoin gambling site they'll get nasty with you as well.  Even though that isn't even illegal.
I dumped my coinbase account before they could even ban me. 
Fuck 'em
@_date: 2014-10-13 14:10:58
No, it doesn't.  But between that and then this, it does mean you look like a bit of a prick.
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:22:26
Do you have an alternate proposal?
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:31:52
Immediately being the key word.
Societies and quasi-governmental bodies form pretty much instantly anytime a small group of humans band together.  When its a large group, it happens slower, but is absolutely inevitable.
Then specialization beings to (re)occur, and suddenly you need a way to trade for goods without bartering, because how many apples can purchase a new chair and who the hell wants that many apples all at once anyway?
Suddenly, gold and silver, and maybe steel in the future, look to be much more useful as currency.  Again.
All of this has happened before, all of it will happen again.

Why not both?
And maybe a little bit of precious metals while you're at it.
And a mutual fund.
Diversify yo shit nigga.

Wagering with bitcoin, whether online or not (of course its online, but whatever) currently is not illegal within the United States.

Do you understand that this isn't relevant?  Whether or not what you're saying is true the vast majority of people *assume* their money is protected, if they bother to consider it at all. 
In this case, and really in the case you originally made, perception trumps reality.

Because the primary impetus that brought consumers to Silk Road was the ability purchase illegal goods.  
You're kind of obviously trying to deflect here, presumably by implying that it wasn't ever illegal to log on to it and browse.  But of course no one is talking about that, and you're splitting hairs for no reason at all except to be contrarian.  Stop.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:27:16
Did I understand that correctly?
I'm meant to give them my private key?
LOL no. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:21:31
I've gotten a few suggestions since posting this already.  I will probably be switching.  Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:20:18
That must be nice. 
I've been waiting a week to resolve an issue that's tied up 2.5  BTC
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:27:10
Yeah but they do.  Cause I did that for cloudbet.com.  As in, I sent the funds to a dead wallet, THEN sent btc to cloudbet. 
Coinbase sent me a nastygram for it.

It was months later.
