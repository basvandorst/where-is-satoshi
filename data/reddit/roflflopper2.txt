That's not quite right. It would be expensive to produce/acquire a five thousand foot tall replica of a piece of poop, but that wouldn't make it valuable.
BTC is valuable because of supply and demand. Cost might influence supply (along with time) but supply is only half the picture

Okay, I'll make a bitcoin fork that has an increased difficulty level and costs even more to produce. And I'll sell it to you for HALF the cost of a real bitcoin.

if a couple hundred bucks could solve this problem, do you think it would still be a problem?

Why would you want those things when you can "add this to your day" on messenger?

saying one chain has lower fees and quicker transaction times counts as "talking shit" and means I need to get a bit more educated?
That's kind of funny actually. You're like a caricature or a stereotype of a cryptocurrency "investor"

If BTC crashes, just send him to college in Europe for 3k/year tuition.

Actually ETH handles far more transactions per day than BTC, so ETH is a glimpse into the future for BTC, if BTC can ever scale.

now is not the next best time. you're on the most bullish btc part of the internet and people are saying this is about to crash
