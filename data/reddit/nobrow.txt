Really? Having a low opinion of coworkers is an indicator of losing money?

Noob question. Why not directly from coinbase to wallet? Why go through gdax?

Can you explain it to me? I googled the poincare conjecture but it's a tad over my head and I don't get how it relates to controlling the universe.

I understand that gold has desirable properties. It has value as a "good".  I'm saying that using it as currency turns it into something speculative. It has more value than what it's usefulness gives it. Paper also has value, albeit a very small value. Turning it into currency then gives it a higher value. It's the same with gold. Gold just has a higher base material value due to its use cases. The current price of gold is not based on its uses but more on it being an appreciating asset. To put it another way people dont invest in gold so they can use it to make something someday, they invest to hopefully turn a profit. It's value is because people are assigning it value same as with fiat. 
Also I never said all value is arbitrary. Value comes from use. The only things with real value are goods and services. Everything else is an abstraction to make commerce easier.
I feel like we aren't on the same page here. I'm not saying gold is a bad investment, I'm not saying it will become worthless. I'm simply pointing out that it's value as a currency is arbitrary and not inherent just like fiat. That's my only point. I agree with you though that it's arbitrary value has more staying power than fiat.

I disagree, there is no way people would be trading food, medicine, ammo, fuel, etc for gold in an end of the world type situation.  The only people who gold has anything other than speculative value to is jewelers and electronics manufacturers.
If we as a society went back to using gold as currency then its value to people outside of these 2 professions would be no different than fiats value, i.e. trading it for other goods and services.  I'm not disagreeing that gold is a good long term recession proof investment.  I'm simply pointing out that it isn't inherently valuable to most people and that makes it no different than fiat in principle.

Look I know an end of the world situation isn't going to happen.  You are the one who brought up nations failing. I was responding directly to that. And I asked because I'm not an economist and perhaps I'm missing something. I do have an opinion obviously but the "fiat bad gold is good" idea is pretty ubiquieteous around here so I was assuming I missed something.   
I'm coming at this from a "in principle" approach. And in principle gold as a currency is no different than fiat. It's arbitrarily assigned value. That is my whole point. I do agree that it would hold value better than fiat but that value is still purely a result of people wanting it because they think it will be worth something not because the value is inherent.

Can you explain why people think gold is so good as a currency or why money backed by gold is a good thing? Isn't gold inherently valueless the same as fiat? For example:
Fiat: I will accept this fiat for my goods and services because I know that others will accept it for their goods and services.
Gold: I will accept this gold for my goods and services because I know that others will accept it for their goods and services.
It has no inherent value other than people agree that it has value.  It seems to me that the the only thing with true inherent value are goods and services themselves.  Humanity started out with that but quickly realized making an abstraction of that value in the form of something easily tradeable but with no inherent value (shells, beads, precious metals, fiat, etc) was the easier way to go.
