BTC has a use. You can spend it at retail stores (depending), you can buy with it online directly without having to exchange the coin first for cash. 
It's not a lot, and not a lot of real world day-to-day business, but it has a *use* and thats more than you can say about the other 399 other X coins. Which have no use expect to 'bring another coin to the game'. 
What he was saying is, all these coins needs to find actual uses and real world scenarios fast, or they will just be that "coin I made to make a buck quickly".
BTC is at the front of that pack and making steps. Now the other 399 coins? "Good Luck - Liam Nesson". 
This has always been the problem with crypto. Exactly like the founder of ETH said..
"Ya'll need to grow up blah blah blah"
Til the community/users take a firm stance on picking a said coin to me the mainstream, it will always be this talk of 'no real use'.

Second this, use them constantly, and with their new process system, its literally less than &lt;10mins, if that depending on the minute you order. Great customer service too.

Read whole thing, only thing I can say is both of you deserve to put your head in shame. Jordan and both Partners. You waited this long and that much money to finally start legal action? All done via E-mails. Never thought to call Jordan? Fly down? What happened to the personal visit in Vegas to see the machine? First step is to public name and shame after this many months and that much money lost? Money must not be a big issue for you guys.... Sad. More money then brains.
Just wow.

To be fair, probably 90% of the people here, never ever ever ever ever think about using their BTC for purchases. Most here read, sit, and wait for their precious coin that went over $1k once, hoping it will go back. Then they cry and bitch when every week some new BS scam comes out around BTC or some evil mining people, or people running with BTC.. 
It's a endless cycle here, and people are just blind bats because all they WANT and WANT TO SEE are the $$$$$ when they sell their BTC when its high again...
People still buying BTC with weekly paychecks... Oh lordy. Those are the people that never spend a dime in BTC and want this to be their retirement check. Also the same people who cry and moan when prices drop. 
Its a horrible trend with BTC, and its never gonna end. The scams, the phonys, the evil miners that Reddit and others protest, shit won't go away. This is BTC. Don't like it? Sell it the scam and move on.

BTC isn't an investment to me, its an experiment/aka cash cow for many, to see if they can/could get rich. It was fun/neat, now its a headache, hassle, nightmare. Every day you wake up to some new BS scam, some new company/people Reddit and BTC community hate. Prices constantly dropping, etc etc. 
Much better things to invest in, and actual turn a profit... or least it actually do something..
