Outputs per day is a better indicator of overall economic activity on the Bitcoin blockchain than transactions per day. Since one transaction can include multiple outputs, the number of total outputs is more important than the number of transactions themselves. Large players in the Bitcoin space use batching--the process of including multiple outputs in a given transaction--to reduce their overall transaction fees. Therefore, looking at only transactions misses an important part of the picture. So, we've created outputs.today to track Bitcoin outputs.

The ratio is definitely the most interesting, and is trending up! Thank you.

We made a small update, definitely easier to read now. Thank you.

Hi Craig, I spoke with John the operator of the machine and he confirmed it is indeed at the Diner, near the front.  He related that there are two ATMs at the Diner (one Genesis1, and one normal ATM). The ATM at Jumbo Slice does not support Bitcoin, unfortunately.

TLDR: Genesis donated a 2-way machine to some months ago, but have been struggling to get Botswana's Pula currency to test our machine with before shipping. Antiquated system has stonewalled our efforts to get the notes from Alakanani for testing.
Any Bitcoiners in South Africa who could travel to Gaborone and pick up the notes from Ms. Alakanani and send them from South Africa to our office in San Diego would be doing us a huge favor and help put Bitcoin infrastructure in areas that need it most.

Evan from Genesis here, the manufacturer of the machine at 1776 --
There is no way for one of our machines to produce an address out of thin air, and no configuration would ever produce an anomaly such as the one OP describes.
In the interest of clarity, we've pulled the device hardware logs from the unit at 1776 and confirmed that indeed, OP did scan the barcode for the 1KFHE7w8BhaENAswwryaoccDb6qcT6DbYY address -- whether knowingly or not:

You can convert the hex data 31 4B 46 48 45 37 77 38 42 68 61 45 4E 41 73 77 77 72 79 61 6F 63 63 44 62 36 71 63 54 36 44 62 59 59 0D to human readable text here:
Which converts to:
I don't have an explanation for how OP could've accidentally scanned the wrong wallet address though -- perhaps he was using Blockchain.info in a web browser and clicked through something on the Block Explorer or something to that effect. OP's post is deleted now but this is probably the most likely case.

Great work!

Hi it isn't possible to hide the exchange rate on a Genesis machine, it is always displayed prominently at the top right of the screen during a transaction, and floats with the market.

Hi Evan from Genesis here. First, I'd like to say I am terribly sorry for your experience. Our node had an unforeseen issue and was stuck behind the network, leading to the awful experience above. This is not what we strive for, and I've taken the appropriate steps to ensure this does not ever happen again -- to you, or anyone else. 
There's no excuse for having to wait this long and -- luckily or not -- we hadn't experienced this issue before and you unfortunately bore the full impact of it for which I am extremely sorry. I sent you a PM, let me help you get this sorted out ASAP.

Hi Evan from Genesis here -- really sorry for this inconvenience, our distributor in Japan who receives all Japanese sales inquiries recently had a death in the family and has been unavailable, if you could kindly PM me your email address or send an email to sales directly I will make sure you get taken care of ASAP.

It's the least I can do to show some solidarity for those who are fighting the good fight out there in the trenches, with nothing but Satoshis in their pockets.
