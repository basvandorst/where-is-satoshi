@_date: 2017-02-12 19:53:38
Ah right on. Thanks man. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:34:23
since it looks like bitcoin won't be coming down in price anytime soon, would it still be a wise choice to buy?
@_date: 2017-03-12 04:02:20
The coins doesnt care about Satoshi
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:23:24
I see. Interesting perspective. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:09:39
Confidence, supply and demand. Buying and selling. Etc. basic economics. Bitcoin is global. For exmple. If America goes to war it won't affect bitcoins prices. Same with the NK conflict, which has been going on for eons and look at BTCs price. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:58:46
For sure. Then add to it when you have a chance. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:56:07
Just cause he doesn't know about cryptos doesnt mean he can't handle peoples money. He is an expert in the traditional banking field. Hardly anyone in global population understands cryptos and less that 1% even participates in it. If that is your perception on how things work in the real world, your in for a rude awakening. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:20:14
It's a lot faster than the current rate of BTC and the meme pool size. Source: personally bought goods and transferred BTC and checked the meme pool
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:14:59
What are your opinions on what is going on?
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:55:16
You should be able to buy bitcoin anywhere except in a few countries. Where are you at?
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:30:31
I did the math on a  report I read that he had 1million bitcoin. With today's prices it's worth over 3 billion. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:00:49
Oh wow. Didn't know about coinbase. Thanks for clearing to up

We all knew it would ever happen since we split. There wasn't any incentive anyway. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:36:33
Same. It was pretty interesting. Especially figuring out who satoshi is. Overall good doc. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:13:56
Well they do trailer to mostly the Chinese market. I think it's a Korean exchange. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:04:14
its pretty ridiculous. I purchased something online using bitcoin this morning 8 hours ago and it still hasn't been confirmed.  I was hoping my products will ship out today but it doesn't look like it until confirmation. If its taking this long I can definitely see people just using their other methods for purchasing online goods. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:22:25
It's can and I think it will imo. BCH is strong right now
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:09:46
This. World events shouldn't affect crypto prices since they are decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:14:54
Please tell me where I mentioned I was an expert. go ahead a reread my comment. ill be waiting. Also this is basic, let me say that again, basic common sense that if one does not understand crypto that doesn't mean he doesn't understand finances. The guy obviously knows his field which is not cryptos which anyone who is interested can DD. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:48:55
Lmao. Looks like Forbes didn't do any Bitcoin DD whatsoever.  There are 2-3 minute videos on YouTube explaining how secure the blockchain is. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:09:06
It may rally again as Polonix is releasing Bitcoin Cash to customers who had BTC on the exchange at the time of the fork on the 14th (tomorrow). Meaning some might dump BCH for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:06:54
ehhh it just went below 4k. The vitality is insane today   
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:47:41
What do you think is going to happen with BTC price? Up or down?
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:53:06
I would. People think the price is high now, imagine what it will be in 6 yrs.  
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:24:49
Awesome I was pretty stoked to hear overstock.com accepting altcoins as payments. This gives people a chance to buy without converting BTC to purchase goods, saving money on fees depending on what the fees are at-at the time. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:05:29
It was pretty much designed in a way that spamming would not be worth time time or money. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:05:07
good times. well not really but Mt. Gox is something I never want to see again. Can you imagine if coinbase fails at this point of time? talk about a bigger crash ihan what MG did to the price. You have a piece of history. keep it. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:49:44
Wait. So you don't really give a fuck about this BTC vs BCH drama just purely spectating while you go wth whatever yields profit? I gotta take a page out of your playbook and keep emotions out of this lol.

Banks would be pissed as mortgage loans would decrease, cutting into profits. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:13:04
That was a compromise between having both segwit and going up to 2mb block sizes. (Segwit2x) I really don't know if it's going to happen since there is not really a need for it now since bitcoin cash has formed.  I don't think core wants 2mb. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:59:16

Exactly. 1 out of 100000 people who sees OPs message will even know what B is. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:47:27
At that point hopefully people will actually use bitcoin the way it was intended for purchasing goods and services. Then we won't have the problem of unnecessary hoarding of coin. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:30:26
How do you guys feel about how long it takes to confirm a transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:21:22
There is probably less than 2% actually using bitcoin out of the global population. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:18:05
What's the deference between coinbase and gdax. I know cb owns gdax.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:50:21
Bitcoin was not developed to be used as a "savings account". It was developed to be used for everyday purchases of goods and services and P2P transactions that cut out the middle man (financial institutions).

What exactly are you trying to say? No wallets to store coins because we really don't have the coins since what really is needed is a private key? What are the security risk? How would we purchase goods without an address? Interesting idea I must say. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:34:56
Thus has been said for years every time bitcoin rallies. It's should be "more people in the world is learning about bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:55:03
I like where your head is at op. creating things for money. I see you hustling. Anyway, show your parents the bitcoin white paper and some videos explaining bitcoin on youtube and market charts and bitcoin conversion charts to add the money up in your account. Good job man. keep it up and you will be richer than your teachers in no time. everything you did sounds completely legal. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:10:45
I say number one. The NK talk is nothing new and has been going on for years, nothing has happened and nothing will happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:19:24
Yeah. Y'all are probably right.  
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:16:11
Probably not since half the people on here are holding it like an investment and not using it as intended. I believe the Asian countries are using it the way it was ment to be used for purchases and transfers of wealth. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:15:26
well we did see 3k within the last 24 hours. I think you are being irresponsible for denying that this train will never stop. its basic Econ 101. what goes up must come down (2013). This thinking is how people lose money. Short term, it will correct. Long term, it will steadily rise to new heights. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:02:12
I have no clue what any of those are let alone heard of them. Looks like I have some research to do lol. I am amazed at this technology I want to learn everything about it. Thank man.

@_date: 2017-08-09 10:56:54
I doubt it. Why should it since it doesn't care about conflict? What I'm saying is that no one controls bitcoin and outside influences shouldn't affect it like fiat does.

Doesn't count......:Jk....not really   An interesting thought. Let's say a foreign Indian exchange has it trading a substantial higher amount that isn't what other markets have it. would Global markets adjust? I'm talking a huge increase and not like the discrepancy we saw was with BCH.

To be fair crypts are nothing like your gps analogy as gps is a better version of its original intention. Satashis intention was to for a global P2P system for transferring money without institutional interference in addition to purchasing goods and services. People have manifest bitcoin to an investment type stock minus the company. A far cry from its original intention, which is another reason why bitcoin cash was formed. So people who are making the kinds of statements you say have every right to.  Unrelated question- What happens when the price drops and everyone panic sells?
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:40:14
I don't think so. Id say anywhere between 5k-7k perhaps and well have to see how the segwit in action plays out and what happens in November. I do see it eventually reaching 10k in the future but no one can predict a time when it will happen. hodl bruh
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:01:10
Worst: not getting in when I saw it all over 4chan years ago. 
Best: stay tuned. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:04:25
I'd look at etherium and bitcoin cash.  Both are young have have growth potential. Bitcoin is default but the key is to just hold and not sell even when things dip.

Dont freak out if the price drops for a few days/weeks. It always comes back up and hits all time highs. sit tight, hodl, were going to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:46:44
Nothing to worry about. We have had this convo when it hit 5k and dipped, when it hit 6k and dipped. Anyone who has been following for the past few months knows better by now not to sell on emotion. Sit tight and well be at 10k in no time. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:58:04
oh for sure. Anything to get your foot in btc will suffice. who knows, that $15 investment today may compound itself to 1000x in the future. What I do is put a small fraction of my paycheck into btc every week. Overtime it has added up and on bull runs like right now, it has payed off. The only advice is to keep educating yourself on btc, blockchain technology and don't sweat it if btc drops in price, it always recovers and hits all time highs. we are living in exciting times.   
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:47:16

@_date: 2017-11-10 05:59:29
Why don’t you have those in a wallet? On a related note, I had my account disabled last month and it took a week for them to respond to my ticket. My account got false flaged and was put on the OFAC banned list.  I just had to verify some information and the support guy reinstated my account. It was quite frustrating due to lack of communication on bitrex  part and the long time it took to get a response. Once I got a response though they were pretty quick about handing the ticket.

Interesting how this would play out. Snap has the missing link demographic that Facebook has been trying to target unsuccessfully for years.

Not too bad.  This is an interesting situation where no one knows where it will stop but this certainly is a time to observe what will happen and see if history repeats itself in terms of people who sold to early or longtemers who have been though a big dip and are not to concerned of this dip. Either way no decision is a wrong decision as long as you feel you made the right move depending ones individual situation.

I Think he is just scared of what bitcoin can and will do in terms of cutting into his traditional profits. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:10:24
I've noticed some online merchants offering a 5%-20% off simply for using bitcoin for payment. I haven't figured out the reason why they do this, but it sure is pretty cool. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:14:57
Not too bad.  This is an interesting situation where no one knows where it will stop but this certainly is a time to observe what will happen and see if history repeats itself in terms of people who sold to early or longtemers who have been though a big dip and are not to concerned of this dip. Either way no decision is a wrong decision as long as you feel you made the right move depending ones individual situation. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:36:58
Interesting. Looks like you have a solid game plan.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:09:58
I don’t think it’s going to be a cliff drop but it will steadily decline over the next few months.

@_date: 2017-10-25 00:16:51
You cant rely on other people to tell you things. You have to do your own DD to make adequate decisions with YOUR money. Let this be a noob lesson for you. However over time bitcoin price will go up. This is a volatile game and the quicker you can understand that, the better you will be. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:27:06
No to bad. Alts are down, btc is up due to people selling alts to buy btc before the fork which is to be expected.  Without that fork btc wouldn’t be at the price it is now.

2x part is in 3 months? Also if I understand correctly we are going to have s soft fork and no split come Aug 1st?
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:57:03
Defiantly the DEA will ban it as it poses a safety threat. I think only certain non-hardcore drugs like cannabis should be decriminalized. Maybe coke should be in that category. High addictive substances like heroin should be dealt with differently as addiction treatment is suggested instead of jail time.  Street use of lethal fentanyl should be banned. The real crooks are the people who we trust to help us like big pharma companies.

If you bought at the peak I wouldn't sell anytime soon. If your interested in other coins, maybe invest in other coins with it bc the market is down right now. You can always exchange other coins back for BTC later.  I use electrum of my desktop wallet. It's basic but gets the job done. Oh and defiantly get a wallet because you don't own the private keys on coinbase, coinbase owns them and if anything happens to cb, there goes your coins.  For best info it's really a mixture of tools like YouTube and basic sites like bitcoin.org. I took time to fully understand the tech behind BTC when I first started. Do your DD on any coin before you invest so you know exactly what your getting yourself into. Stay away from ICOs (high risk) and pump and dumps until you know exactly how they work what you are doing(if you want to dabble with high risk activity)  BTC is pretty simple. hodl if your are in this long term, don't freak out when the market is down like it is right now. Buy when price is low maybe use it to buy a couple of things online, annnnnd never put in what you are willing to lose.  Goog luck man. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:22:33
How about like the top 10 or top 15 or have it somehow pull info from coinmarktcap. Love the idea though and that you are making it happen. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:58:07
Loool. I think It will take a dip within the next few weeks. Right now is a bad time to buy since we're going to the moon, if anyone is looking to get in  imo
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:13:27
Yup. Extreme Bullish day today 
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:40:22

.99? If people took 2 seconds they can open up their phone browser and look at it for free. Maybe add more coins and I'd buy it. Looks good overall though.

Trumps main thing is more of the addiction side effects of opiates. I have to look for it but it was one of his campaign promises. More regulation of prescription pain killers to be specific I think it was and not necessarily drugs in general,  
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:05:20
So what does this all mean? All the segwit shit may not even survive? Is the bitcoin we want (original intentions of nakimodo) saved and will continue

Didn't know he controls bittrex or kraken. I doubt one sole person can manipulate prices.

It's not about winning or losing, it's about what is in the best interest of bitcoin and its future for the benefit for every single person on the planet.

Not yet.

Interesting. So this fork that is not happening is going the be the first one to keep the same blockchain?  I'm Still noobing here and didn't know forks with bitcoin were a regular thing. I guess this non happening fork is just hyped up.

I see. The SEC ruled that ICOs are securities and are subject to regulation with mixed reviews in the community. I always see people warning against ICOs as high risk. Thanks for explaining the scam.

looking back then to today, right now 7/22/17 with btc @ +2750 do you think you would have made more profit just by investing in btc instead of Genesis?

It's been fluctuating 1-2% the past day or so. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:02:14
How would you think it does long term? Would the split to bcc be comparable to when btc was first created. Kind of like starting over?
