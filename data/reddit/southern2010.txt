This is cute. Unfortunately, money makes money. My question : can we afford not to borrow money and invest in bitcoin?

Bought in at 21,000. Borrowing money as we speak to double down at 10,000. This might be the last time to buy bitcoin this low. And when total value hits world gdp THEN we'll see who is laughing.

Here is the secret that MAIN STREET doesn't want you to hear. Bitcoin is only beginning. You want to buy a house in the future? Likely to be funded by bitcoin rather than worthless paper cash. Same with jobs automation and everything out.
So. Can you afford not to buy?

This guy gets it. Short USD. Long Bitcoins. HODL though anything.

As long as they hold its only paper losses. When your buying a car or house directly with bitcoin in a few years you will wonder why you ever needed us dollars.

This. Big players manipulating the market so that they can buy in. True value is easy to calculate, world gdp / total btcs. ;)

Aha. OK Bro. Try transacting at that price. Fact is there's a price for sellers, and for buyers and for winners (hodlers).

Please. Immediately repurchase those coins. BTC likely to never be this cheap again. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:29:53
Hah. Yes please leave. I've borrowed to invest significantly and the only thing that scares me about these lower prices is whether I can buy even more at this new cheap price.
Buying a 20,000 asset for 7,000? Yes, run.

Hah. Questions like this make me happy. Let's discuss later from my BITCOIN MANSION.
