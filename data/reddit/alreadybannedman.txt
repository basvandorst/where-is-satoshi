What is that taxed at though?
And is it again taxed when trying to cash out?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:17:22
lmao, and you're in the US?
mind a PM?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:26:09
The thing is morally, I would work with and "give" the IRS like 10-20%.
I've never had a need to cash out USD until now.  I have other holdings but in all honesty I'm not worried about those because those are like ghosts, keys are safe, no one is touching them or knows about them.
I've been using the gains to just pay for gift cards and games n stuff.
Day trading isn't as hard as ppl make it out to be, patience is really all you need, especially as volatile as cyprto is.
40% is ridiculous to tax someone, that's almost half of their money.  Unless I have billions, I would never pay that.  My personal situation is irrelevant to how ridiculous 40% tax on someone making below millions is.
Its also ridiculous because its taxing the trades AND the cash out.
I consulted with the only people that even knew about cyrpto at the time and they literally just never paid taxes on theirs.  At least the ones I knew, in discussions, it was always a super grey area with no definitive answer.  
That's why I'm asking now.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:21:17
what is the rate for short team capital gains?
and then when you cash out do you pay another tax?
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:38:42
The problem is thousands of exchanges, dozens of wallets, not even sure when/where and how some of it happened.
lol thanks, but it looks like I could actually have that all fucked away from me if every single trade is taxed.  Cause then its taxed when I turn it into fiat? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:26:33
lmao, so they won't ask "where did you get this random 20k" ?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:36:20
I'll shop around, if I've learned anything though is you don't tell anyone anything about what you're doing unless you're 100% sure.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:43:32
I remember when I used APPL to buy GOOG. /s
Seriously though, crypto can't be compared to stockmarkets for this.
What is the value of btc rn? each exchange will give you a different answer.
what about private trades? etc.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:29:45
So if I bought 1 btc at exactly 12 pm today, and sold it at exactly 3 pm, what did I buy it for and what did I sell it for?
Bought with ETH and sold for XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:00:47
"you" can't, I'm not a corporation lol, at that point they have their own rules to play by I'm sure.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:38:35
ok, that makes sense... so why do ppl say each trade is taxed now or something?
The thing you linked seems so simple.  I'll go with that because honestly, to the best of my knowledge that's what it is.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:34:12


You simply cannot buy APPL with GOOG or vice versa like you can alts.


yes, and its on a definitive trading platform and heavily regulated.


my arbitrage bots doing 1% compounding near 20% a day care to disagree but I wouldn't argue that.
I'm just saying, if its enough to make a decent profit, it should be enough to argue that the value is relative to exchange, especially when dealing with exchanges outside the US.


yea, but that's back to where is the line drawn? does the government tax ppl trading cards at a tournament? why is it any different?  This is like the beanie baby crazy years back, ppl were trading those like crazy, why not subject to tax?
I *know* its a ridiculous argument but a ridiculous argument for a ridiculous set of rules.  Should just flat tax the cash outs, taxing day trades/alt trades is a cancer.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:31:52
See honestly I'm fine with doing this and if they give me hassle, they can have the hundreds of pages of trades to maybe try to weasel out another few thousand.
I feel its completely fair to just tax out cashing out to bank via fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:46:48


do you have a source for this?
this is what I want to do, rather than keep track of all my day trades 
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:41:12
records of thousands of exchanges?
Are those exchanges taxed?
If I have to pay a tax on the trades AND the cashout that's gonna easily be over 40% which is going to be utterly ridiculous imo
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:02:41
theoretically, how much have you taken out?  and same, never heard of it either, not trying to be the first though, lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:57:26
how do you buy a car with your crypto gains then?
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:12:25
yea, its crazy right now lol, I'm just trying to buy a car.  It's going to be really ridiculous if all this work comes out to nothing because of some tax bs.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:07:30
But where is the line drawn? 
You can't buy a stock with another stock, otherwise I would agree.  The stock market is also regulated, afaik there isn't any institution that determines the value of btc, or any alts, how would you say "this trade was worth this much" when there's no real nominal, fiat value to any of it?  Every exchange has a different price.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:36:50


Its just a pile of btc in a wallet, so hold it aka just don't touch it?


I have 0 income.  This is my income lol.


but what have I gained? What is the institution that determines the USD value of my trade?  Arbitrage is a thing too.
Basically, I've made probably over 1000 exchanges, even used bots.  How the hell does one even tax that?
Right now its all just still sitting in btc.
So if all those trades are taxable, and then say within this year btc flops, I have to pay taxes on those trades and essentially end with a "fine"?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:01:34
I can do that, but will they then be like "cough up 20% of each trade" or some other bs?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:27:07
everywhere I see, ppl say each trade is taxed though.  I like the way you describe better but I can't find any definitive info on either one.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:31:51
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:55:55
lmao, see, I've been doing a few 1k transactions
BUT, I feel once its like a monthly 2k or something it might raise some flags. Then if I *do* get audited then I may be fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:57:06
Why can't you tell me exactly how much it was then? It is public information, you can look up the price it was at a certain time, no?
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:29:20
Yea, and all you have to do to be rich is buy apple stock when it first came out.
Besides, "net worth" is essentially doubled, I've lost track of how much I've spent, maybe ~1k a month on random stuff.  I kept the initial investment in coins almost consistent while *making* 50k.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:00:28


How is that possible though?  They don't have a "true fiat value" do you just pick a random exchange or something?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:37:24
Yea, it really makes no sense because exchanges have a variance.  I still feel it would be like the IRS trying to tax pokemon cards if they started to get really popular to trade or something.  Its just ridiculous.
I'll file like this (cashout - initial invest) * [tax rate] and if they want to go through thousands of pages of trades then they can.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:45:28
Doesn't huge deposits trigger a flag for the bank aka the IRS?
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:56:53
I don't see how this is any different from the irs trying to get a cut of a pokemon card swap.
Cards have a value, just as crypto does.
Taxes on cashing out to a bank make sense.  Taxes on a crypto-crypto trade don't.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:27:30
and you could also go 50k to 10k with a single trade.  I did something and it worked, can't complain.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:02:56


At what rate?  
With 0 "income" I have right now, would it fall under 15%?
that isn't terrible, and I can theoretically export most of the trades.
doing taxes for each trade seems near impossible though when there isn't actually a "value", like what institution determines the value of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-01-30 09:06:37
damn, looks like they deleted the account right from the database or something, not even suspended
@_date: 2019-01-30 09:03:51
Are you sure he isn't paid by the GOP to look like an absolute fuckwit and be a terrible representation of the "anti-trump" movement?
I'd buy it, lmao
