I want everything for a reasonable price and reasonably convenient. Prices have been unreasonably high for as long as I can remember and have only recently started to get better. I learned to bypass copy protection as a kid. DRM is still a thing and is still getting bypassed, by legitimate and illegitimate users alike. When downloading a movie is done in 10 minutes for free, why would I pay $20 to buy it in a DRM-ridden and inconvenient format? Watching it may be worth $5 to me that night, maybe $0.
Subscription-based streaming services are a nice innovation, they need to get better and we also need everything to be online, user friendly and affordable.

You're asking a short-term question. I don't know where the price is going right now, but I don't think we're ready for a major bubble just yet and I also don't think the price is going to crash until we've had at least a minor bubble. That is based on my gut feeling. The auction and any hype surrounding it is insignificant.
In the long term I think the price will keep going up. "Genuinely" even though it is and will continue to be inflated by speculation.

If their normal activities on average cost the company more than the revenue it generates, they are in trouble. Let's be generous here and assume they're not actually in trouble.
But I guess there is a point to be made. If they can predict how profitable each activity will be and have exhausted their list of profitable activities, they have to choose from a list of unprofitable activities or downsize their staff. Perhaps they have good reasons to keep their staff employed even though they don't have enough profitable activities from them. Perhaps they decided to let their staff implement bitcoin instead of reading reddit and posting pictures of their pets on facebook.

If 99.9% of miners were to stop mining for one difficulty adjustment, that adjustment would take about 2000 weeks if no new miners were added.

As a user, I would prefer to not use any cables at all, and very little happening automatically. Here's how I see the event flow:
1. I set the speaker volume of both computers to comfortable listening volume
2. I prepare a transaction on computer A
3. I click "listen" on computer B
4. I click "send" on A
5. I hear the beeps, like an old-school modem or a fax machine
6. B stops listening automatically when a valid TX is received
7. I visually inspect the received transaction and its checksum
8. I click "sign" on B
9. I click "listen" on A
10. I click "send" on B
11. Again I hear the beeps
12. A automatically stops listening and verifies that the now signed transaction is identical to the one it created
13. I click "broadcast" on A
A bit cumbersome perhaps, but every step is designed to expose any foul play.

You're extrapolating numbers from two nodes and assuming those numbers are relevant for all nodes. They are not.




Most users will not be downloading the whole block chain. They will connect to one or several nearby nodes and they will have to trust those nodes to some extent. This is not the same as centralization, because anyone can run a full node.


Yes they must. That block will propagate from one node, spreading through the network to all the other nodes. Most of the nodes will, by the time they get it, not have any nodes to send it to, because they all have it by then.


You are right that most consumers don't have 300 Mbit/s upload speed right now, or even 300 Mbit/s download speed. In most countries it's not even available. In many European countries, and also Japan and South Korea, up to gigabit download speeds are available for consumers. Not everywhere, but in some of the major cities.


The beauty of peer-to-peer and the internet is that even with thousands of nodes in different parts of the world, the data doesn't have to be sent thousands of times over the same transatlantic link. The network just has to have a sensible topology. That is one of the things software developers can fix if you just throw enough money at the right people.

As long as the block rewards are much larger than the fees, miners should do whatever it takes to keep users happy. Happy users = rising bitcoin price = more profit for miners. In other words the time limit for fixing this is when the block reward loses its defining power on mining revenues. Hopefully a permanent solution has been implemented by then.

This is my reaction too after reading this post. Bitcoin is brilliant, but still very immature.


I still haven't used bitcoin to buy anything and I don't intend to until I can buy something I need easier with bitcoin than with debit card. I'm aware of the trust issues with exchanges and I know I'm taking a counterparty risk just keeping money or bitcoins in an exchange.
All this has nothing to do with bitcoin being good or bad, it has everything to do with the bitcoin ecosystem not having had enough time and adoption to mature properly yet. When governments recognize bitcoin as naturally as they do cash, gold or company shares - when "web wallets" have the same deposit guarantees and security measures (or preferably better) as online banks - when bitcoin payments in retail are more secure and reliable than existing card solutions - then bitcoin will be mature enough to take over the world. Until then we're all just pioneers in a very interesting and lucrative experiment.

I think bitcoin just doesn't have the market cap for it yet, and the security is also pretty immature.

When they'd make the announcement, the price would skyrocket and people would seriously look at adopting it. By the time they'd finally start using it.. well I guess they'd need a time period where they'd use both BTC and USD and gradually transition to more and more trades settled in BTC.

What you're implying is to give a bitcoin-denominated loan with negative interest rate. There is no incentive to do that, as simply holding the bitcoins would be more profitable than lending them out.
The only alternative would be to denominate the loan in something other than bitcoin. Then the loan would act as a hedge against the risk of holding bitcoin.

You are interpreting those metrics incorrectly. Keep in mind that all the data transmitted has to be transmitted somewhere. Where is that? To other nodes. When the data has reached all the nodes, they don't need to keep sending it, because every node has it.
tldr; Nodes should on average use 1-3x as much bandwidth for receiving as they use for sending, with some nodes using much more and many nodes using only a little bit.








Consumers have 300 Mbit/s and faster connections right now. It's real, it's not a futuristic fantasy. It's not expensive, it's not exclusively for the elite.

In the beginning, bitcoin was just a cool research project for crypto-nerds. The price reflected that.
Now, it's seen as an opportunity for venture capitalists and speculators. That potential can drive the price further up, but not as high as $100k.
Future price increases will require bitcoin to mean something more to someone. It needs recognition and adoption, ultimately it needs to take significant market share from something else: Gold, USD, PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, Western Union, etc. Right now bitcoin's market share is laughably small and its price is &gt;99% speculation.

Bitcoin won't be as useful as it can be unless the price is reasonably stable. The price won't be stable unless the market cap is very high. A high market cap means a high price per coin. Whether $100k or $1M or $10M is high enough remains to be seen.


I for one don't complain about wealth disparity. But I honestly believe that I as a computer scientist ought to earn as much as a lawyer or bankster with comparable education. The funny situation in Norway where I lived was that I earned a very average salary, comparable to someone with a much shorter education than me. So I said fuck it and moved to a less equal country where my skills have higher value.
Do the farmers and factory workers here deserve to be poor? No. Do banksters and criminals deserve to be rich? No. But the reality is that opportunities exist and those who grab them get rewarded. Ideally wealth distribution would be completely *fair*, but not completely *equal*. Bitcoin does nothing to solve that problem, but it can solve a whole lot of other problems.

The price of one bitcoin is not important, but a high **market cap** is necessary for several reasons:
* Higher market cap means lower volatility. Low volatility makes it better both as a medium of exchange and a store of value.
* Higher market cap means higher liquidity and lower slippage, enabling higher value transactions.
* Higher market cap means that more financial power is concentrated in the hands of bitcoin owners, and those owners have greater incentive to protect their investment. They can do that by adding hashing power, by lobbying politicians to make favorable laws, and by encouraging others to use bitcoin.
The sum of it is that higher market cap makes bitcoin safer, more predictable, more versatile and more efficient.

A "51%" attack is pretty much guaranteed to succeed if someone controls 51% of the hash rate, so security goes out the window when that happens. However with about 20% to 40% someone can realistically perform double spend attacks with a high chance of success. The chance of success decreases exponentially with number of confirmations required, while the cost of each attempt increases linearly with the amount of hash power behind those confirmations.

No. The resources spent on mining must follow the value of the block rewards, not the other way around. When the block reward drops, mining will become less profitable and some miners will have to shut down their hardware. The trend lately has been exponentially increasing mining difficulty which far outweighs the effects of reward halving. What keeps miners in business is the exponentially increasing price of bitcoin.

Nothing is guaranteed and the price could crash permanently any time. The price is very volatile and mostly backed by speculation. The fundamental factors change slowly and won't even be close to catching up with speculation for many years to come.
Buying bitcoin for a quick profit is pure gambling. Buying bitcoin for long-term profit (5-10 years) is also gambling, but I believe it has much better odds. With an outlook that long, a 1 year slump is meaningless.

Your posts are well-written and coherent. I'm sure there are many failure stories that are quietly swept under the rug.

Nowhere does he claim that an asteroid capture would be the entirety of those 5 trillion.
AFAIK the most expensive space project in history is the ISS at ~$100 billion. I think an asteroid could be captured into LEO for less than that price. Then it's just a matter of cutting it into pieces and bringing the pieces down to Earth. I don't know what SpaceX charges for a Dragon mission, but let's just assume they make the F9 reusable and that a complete Dragon cargo mission costs $60 M. That's $20k per kg, or about half the current price of gold. So the asteroid needs to be 5000 tonnes to break even if the capture mission costs $100 billion.

One way they could make money would be to stock up on bitcoins now while it's cheap, and then watch the value of their coins skyrocket after they add it to youtube.
If they really wanted to get rich they'd acquire a small bank and use the bank's resources to make a bitcoin bank. Then they'd integrate Google Wallet with that bank's infrastucture and add bitcoin to Google Wallet. They'd have to put some developers on improving bitcoin and maybe making their own bitcoin client.
With Google behind it, bitcoin could be ready for mass adoption in just a few years. All our wet dreams would come true. And of course Google would earn money just by HODLing while pushing adoption.
If that isn't enough for them, they could act as an exchange for a small fee. With low fees, good security, ease of use and lots of hype, they'd quickly become a major, if not the major exchange. Being a major exchange when adoption becomes mainstream could be extremely profitable.

Interesting theory. It adds up.

He can't outright steal people's deposits, that would be too ovbious and land him in jail. Instead he profited on market manipulation, maybe using an account not in his own name. Naturally that account will be one of the first to receive its coins when withdrawals are re-enabled right before mtgox goes bankrupt.

Just one comment: An ID collision isn't necessarily a problem, since the receiver can just brute force the solution that gives a valid block hash. It requires more CPU power when there are many collisions, but like you said the chance of a collision is very small.
Say you have two transactions with id 0xAA. One is number 2, the other is number 3. That gives two alternative blocks (1,2,3 and 1,3,2). One of those blocks gives a valid hash when combined with the nonce.

Currently fiat withdrawals are crippled and BTC withdrawals are temporarily disabled after lots of problems.


The low price now is because withdrawals are disabled and people have lost faith in mtgox. Depositing fiat into mtgox is slow so you may lose the opportunity to buy cheap coins, and it exposes you to the risk that MtGox could be insolvent and default on deposits.


The issue is mainly with how MtGox implemented their withdrawal handling code. Any competent exchange should not be vulnerable whether it's dealing in bitcoins or altcoins.

If it was mined by a pool, it was distributed to the miners in that pool based on how much they've contributed recently. If it was mined by a solo miner, he got all of it for himself.
28 BTC is only slightly more than a normal block reward, so for most decently sized pools this would be worth about half an hour to several hours of mining. For a solo miner it could be worth weeks or months of mining.

1. Install Tails on a USB or CD

6. Write down the master public key
7. Shut down computer
8. Plug computer back in
9. Reboot computer
10. Create a watch-only wallet using the master public key
Now you have a seed phrase on paper. If you lose it or someone steals it, you lose your coins. Personally I don't keep it on paper, I keep it encrypted on several different computers in several different countries. Choose whatever method works for you.

They're not supposed to be reliable, but in practice they are pretty reliable for two reasons:
1. The rate of orphan blocks is pretty low.
2. Even when a block is orphaned, most of its transactions are usually included in the competing block.
Even if the orphan rate increased to the point where 1-conf transactions were not reliable enough for everyday use, what would it matter? Confirmations would be blazing fast and waiting a few minutes would get you all the confirmations you'd need.

Latency is less of an issue than bandwidth and processing power. Typical ping times between USA and europe is 100-200 ms. That's negligible compared to 1 minute. There is however room for optimization in how much, how fast, and when data is transfered.


Solo mining is pretty much unfeasible anyway. Even the biggest and best connected pools get orphans, just somewhat less frequently than others. Unless the orphan rate increases to several percent it's not much of an issue anyway.

The "10 minutes' worth of security" line of thought only applies to a 51% attack. It's basically not going to be relevant except for extremely high value transactions.
For normal use cases, a fast confirmation isn't much different from a slow confirmation. I don't remember the math, but I think 8 1-minute confirmations are about equivalent to 6 10-minute confirmations. The exact number depends on how much hash rate the attacker controls.

There can be no confusion about the order of blocks, since one block is always built on top of another.

Using a reasonably affordable SSD gives us around 100k IOPS, so scaling to match VISA's 2k average tps we still have 50 IOPS per transaction.

Who would throw away a block just to disrupt the network a little? If the block has been mined and is invalid, then a miner has thrown away his block reward just to troll some nodes for a few minutes. More resourceful nodes will only pause for a few seconds before determining that the block is bogus.
Spamming single transactions shouldn't be a problem. Any node who forwards invalid transactions at a high rate should be blacklisted by the other nodes.

Only to ask yourself "Is this a good idea?" for each of your suggestions. I'll answer it for you: No it isn't.

Wrong. We're simply looking for cases where a shorter wait would be preferable. Users want convenience.


Reduce security? This whole discussion is based on the premise that the security wouldn't necessarily be reduced by the change. I agree that we shouldn't sacrifice security for convenience in bitcoin core, but it seems that this change can be done (after optimizations are applied) without sacrificing any security.

When you run a full node you still trust the rest of the network. It's just improbable that they would all collaborate to feed you false data.
It's not like you just take somebody's word that a transaction has been broadcast to the network and included in a block and had several blocks mined on top of it. You can actually check all those claims with a third party without downloading the whole blockchain yourself. If someone feeds you false data, you can find out and you can avoid trusting them in the future.
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:59:44
Supply is mined coins *per time unit*. Demand is fiat *per time unit*. For the price to be stable, all that's required is that the price reaches the point where supply equals demand and that both the price and the demand remain stable.
If you want to compare supply and demand you must convert one or the other to either bitcoin or fiat, since supply is defined in bitcoins and demand is defined in fiat. It makes most sense to convert the bitcoin supply to fiat when comparing it to the demand, since fiat has a much more stable value.

If it's invalid it will be rejected by any node that receives it, severely limiting the damage it can do.

Nike is a bad example. They are a well-known brand and can charge extra for their stuff, plus much of their stuff is made in Cambodia or somewhere where US inflation doesn't matter much.
To get a reliable picture I think you need to measure the prices of a whole bunch of things - food, energy, housing, transportation and such. And then adjust for factors that don't have anything to do with inflated money supply.

1. 
2. That's right, the cost is moved from the miner to the pool. The cost of running a full node even with 20 MB blocks would be miniscule compared to the block rewards even a small pool brings in. It effectively solves the problem. You can keep complaining that pools cause centralization, but that's a different discussion entirely.
3. I assume you mean Satoshi Dice. That's not spam, no matter how much you want it to be.
4. The fact remains: Including a fee would have gotten their transactions confirmed quicker.

Correction/addition to your point 5.
A transaction has no concept of 'person'. It moves coins from one or more addresses to one or more addresses. What person or entity or multiples thereof controls the addresses in question is meaningless to the bitcoin network. All that matters is a valid signature for each of the source addresses.

* Everyone involved in developing/hosting blockchain are honest
* SSL is completely secure
* Blockchain's SSL certificate is completely secure and cannot be forged
* The computer you use them with is completely secure
* Your wallet backups are completely secure
That's a very long list of assertions, I wouldn't trust ANY of those absolutely. Much less all of them at once.

1. Valid. It's a tradeoff for the scalability that needs to be in place already when the need arises.
2. Pooled mining solves that problem.
3. We haven't seen much of it yet, so it's only a hypothetical issue.
4. It seems to work fine so far. People who send transactions without sufficient fees risk having to wait a long time for confirmation. Transactions with a normal fee get confirmed quickly.
5. If 80% of the miners get on board, the rest of the miners will be forced to get on board too. If all the miners get on board, all the users will also be forced to get on board. So yes, the miners are in a special position.

The article is trying to define "accepting bitcoin" as taking bitcoin directly and *not* converting it to fiat. That's a ludicrous definition for the reason I explained in my previous comment.
If he really wanted to discuss downward price pressure, he would have chosen a more nuanced headline. As it stands it's at best clickbait, at worst intentional bashing.
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:33:48
He has access to all that information. It doesn't mean he uses it to trade. He could have just lied and said "no I don't trade" or "no I only trade on another exchange". He was honest and you're jumping to conclusions.
That said, I wouldn't worry about it. Since bitcoin isn't regulated, insider trading of bitcoin isn't illegal. I would assume it happens on every exchange, and only when it's discovered that they're screwing their customers (which isn't the case here) is there reason for outrage.

1. Yeah that's a stupid quirk of reddit markup
2. Mining isn't centralized just because the biggest pools are centralized. Any miner can join a small to medium-sized pool, or start their own if they think more pools are needed.
3. How much is "lots"? How many percent of the blockchain is spam? How many blocks have been filled to capacity because of spam?
4. And yet every now and then we have someone complaining that their transaction takes ages to confirm because they didn't include a fee.
5. And how will the network reach that consensus? Do you think enough node operators are so strongly opposed to this change that they can effectively boycott all the miners? A boycott would require pretty much all the node owners to agree in order to be effective.

Bitcoin will only be used for settlements between banks and other big players, and everyone who wants to use it for everyday shopping must use *some alternative solution*. Since alternative solutions aren't in place yet, the worst case scenario is that Bitcoin becomes useless and most users switch to an altcoin with better capacity.
A more realistic scenario is that alternative solutions are developed in a hurry, and users must adopt them if they want to keep using bitcoin whether or not those solutions are actually any good.
A better scenario would be if we had time to develop good alternative solutions and users could migrate to the solution of their choice, at their leisure. Increasing the block size limit can buy us that time.

The coins wouldn't become worthless, but there is a potential for double spend attacks if an entity accepts payments that are confirmed on one chain without waiting to see if it gets confirmed on the other as well. Easily solved by requiring confirmation on both chains.

That roadmap only came out about a month ago, has no immediate block size increase, and depends on SegWit and LN. Both are good solutions, but they cannot be rolled out before a thorough code review and a lengthy debate. They can't fix the scaling issue on their own either, we need bigger blocks. 2 MB blocks are not nearly as scary as Core makes it sound, and it's the quickest and least risky band aid for the scalability problem.

I still haven't seen any proof of that claim. Specifically: What breaks when moving to 2 MB blocks that cannot be trivially fixed?
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:00:31
Well now people claim the limit is necessary, so maybe it won't be so temporary. But it can at least start out as a temporary limit.
@_date: 2015-05-03 09:52:06


Whether it's necessary is a moot point. If bitcoin becomes *the* currency of the future, it will inevitably increase about that much in value.


I don't believe it can be stable at that price, no. The market cap is too low, the liquidity is too low. In order for it to be stable at such a price, it would have to have a small and very clearly defined niche and a stable market share of that niche. I don't think that's likely to happen.

Finding alternative ways to scale bitcoin is necessary and I think LN and SegWit look really nice, but all they did about the block size issue was stall for more time. That was the issue they most urgently needed to discuss.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:30:57
It's annoying, but it's not so bad that it's a problem yet. A 2 MB block limit won't be enough to make it a problem either. Software optimization can speed it up a lot because the current way it's done is very inefficient.
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:53:30
2 MB blocks isn't magically going to centralize mining any more than it already is. Specialized mining hardware that's useless for anything else already took care of that. Want to make mining more distributed? Switch to a proof of work that existing consumer hardware is good at. 3D Rendering, video encoding, generating dynamic web pages and so on.

I don't read much of what Mike Hearn writes.
But I have observed that blocks are getting fuller and fuller. [The average block size]( has been above 0.5 MB for months already and is currently at 0.66, which is a doubling from 1 year ago. If the trend continues we will run out of space in about half a year unless something is done.
Since a fork should be well reviewed, well discussed, and well prepared, we should have started the process a year ago. Doing it now means we have less time to ensure that nothing breaks.
@_date: 2016-01-17 10:05:36
Bitcoin has currently very little room to grow, and it keeps growing. Core showed no signs of doing anything about it. Users are getting uneasy, they don't believe the Core team has been acting in the best interest of the users and of Bitcoin.

It depends what kind of inflation we're talking about. QE is *monetary inflation*. Rising prices is often called *price inflation*. It's true that monetary inflation is linked to price inflation, but this time the falling prices are because of productivity improvements, not because of inflation.

Perhaps exponentially. I don't know exactly. It's something like that.
@_date: 2016-01-17 12:25:07


If that happens then users really should abandon the 1 MB fork because it shows that the increase was necessary.


Those outputs will for all practical purposes be unspendable until one fork wins.


If the network stayed in a forked state over a long time, yes. I think a situation like that would be resolved long before getting to that point.

I agree.
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:42:43

You can estimate it within a reasonable confidence interval. +/- 10% in an hour is not significant for bitcoin fees, but it's the difference between 10% profit or 10% loss in day trading.

There's a difference between censoring scammers, spammers and trolls, and censoring legitimate debates about important issues.
The reason why the censorship is important to your opinion is that one side of the discussion was unable to freely express their views in this sub. Perhaps with better access to the other side's version, your opinion would have been swayed sooner.
It's not just a technical discussion, although technical reasons is the big devil that's been painted on the wall to make bigger blocks sound scary. Bitcoin will not fail by making blocks 2 MB instead of 1.
The real reasons are political and economic. Blockstream is a company focused on sidechains, and by keeping blocks small they hope to get more people to use their product. Bitcoin Core is run in large part by people associated with Blockstream.
I, and many others, don't want Blockstream to decide Bitcoin's direction. We believe these small blocks are hurting bitcoin and that the capacity should be increased as much as the technology reasonably allows, because the other scalability fixes aren't ready yet.
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:04:57






Where are the facts that show that 2 MB blocks are dangerous? Since your position is based on fact I assume you can back it up with convincing evidence. Please show me the evidence.

It's a bad thing. It ensures that if anything goes wrong, there won't be enough time to fix it.
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:30:06


Because of the vulnerability I wrote about in [this post?]( That can be fixed, it's apparently not difficult to do either.


I found some numbers for that:






1.5% loss in revenue is meaningful, certainly unfortunate, but it doesn't break bitcoin. I think a relay network is a good idea anyway, actually I think there should be more than one relay network. I don't see why that would be a threat to decentralization. If miners decide it's cheaper to set up a relay network than what they lose to orphans, why not? Seems inevitable to me.


Fucked over by not getting to decide what's best for everyone? Why do you think an upgrade to 2 MB will destroy bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:47:56
As I understand it, none of that is necessary for simply switching to 2 MB blocks. Can't we just double the sigops limit and the block size limit and roll out a patch?
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:01:29
It doesn't cut them out of development, it just removes their ability to dictate policy. They, like anyone else, are welcome to submit pull requests to Classic or to make Core compatible with the block size increase.
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:13:10
Maybe you should provide some more context with your link: 


Nobody has yet come up with a good answer to that question, so until then I assume there isn't one.

That would be a very interesting situation. I almost want it to happen just for the popcorn factor.
I would probably support both forks if that happened.
@_date: 2016-01-17 10:50:23


[This comment right here]( is a recent example. If you could provide solid proof that switching to 2 MB blocks is dangerous, that would greatly diminish Classic's support.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:23:41
Blocks will be full soon, and a fork takes time. We should start now so it's out when we actually need it.
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:56:30
You would achieve the same goal easier by having a dynamic block size limit.
Messing with the difficulty is just asking for trouble.
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:34:44
Just because it's possible to exploit doesn't mean it's actually a problem for anyone. Full RBF would be trivial to exploit and would completely break 0-conf. People use 0-conf because the convenience is worth the risk, not because they think there is no risk.
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:13:02
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:14:25


And anyone can turn off 0-conf if they want to protect themselves against it. Other more sophisticated counters can also be developed. There is no reason to intentionally sabotage for those who want to accept 0-conf.
@_date: 2016-01-17 10:46:11


This is news to me. If it really is true, then switching to Classic is indeed reckless. If you can't point it out directly, what can you do to convince me that it's true?
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:53:17


It's sad that it had to come to this, but they really were asking for it. 


That's what it has been all along. The community has finally decided who we want to be in charge, and it's not the Core team.

The Chinese miners can validate their blocks outside China to save bandwidth.
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:30:18
So let me see if I understand it correctly:
* Bitcoin is already somewhat vulnerable to this type of attack
* Increasing block size to 2 MB and temporarily limiting transaction size to 100 kB doesn't make it meaningfully worse, and doesn't break any existing functionality
* The limit can be changed or removed when a better solution is implemented

So a bit like Bitcoin then? Except that no one is smarter than Satoshi of course
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:23:06
OK, so 1 MB transactions cause problems. Why not temporarily limit transaction size then, until a better solution can be implemented? That is a transaction size issue, not a block size issue.
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:14:04

@_date: 2016-01-16 19:59:04


The 2 MB limit is a compromise in order to get as many as possible on board and it solves the immediate capacity problem.
It's no secret that this is a political issue just as much as a technical one. Choosing Classic means we no longer have to accept whatever Core decides is best for us.
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:58:51
LN is a great invention that won't solve the immediate scaling issue and it isn't enough to fix scalability on its own.
2 MB blocks *will* solve the immediate issue and *may* buy enough time to roll out LN.
Decentralization requires bigger blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:48:03
That sounds more like Classic than Core.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:29:37
LN is a very cool solution to a very difficult problem. Even with LN we will still need bigger blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:56:42
Can it really?


That's from the BIP itself: 
Look, I'm not against SegWit. I think it sounds cool. I just don't think we can rush ahead and start using it right away, before it's been thoroughly reviewed and accepted by the community.

Hashing time scales quadratically with transaction size due to inefficient code.

They can't control him, but if they didn't like what he was doing they could have spoken out against him. The silence from that side of the debate was deafening. Regardless of Core's involvement, censorship is a social issue that we as a community should have done something about much sooner.
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:52:41
I'm not sure how meaningful the distinction is when their actions have been so well aligned. If Blockstream and the Core team really had nothing to do with his actions, they should have spoken out against him and been more willing to discuss the block size issue.
@_date: 2016-01-17 10:38:27
I agree with you, the whole situation is a clusterfuck of nasty, underhanded tactics. Theymos' censorship in here too, I'm amazed it has been allowed to go on for so long.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:47:07
8 MB blocks are probably fine too, but 2 MB will do for now. Blocks won't grow to 8 MB right away even if the limit is increased, so there's still time to optimize the software better to handle the big blocks.
I don't think another PoW will happen unless bitcoin faces a major competitor and Bitcoin's PoW is considered inferior. Other coins exist with different PoW but none of them have any market cap to speak of, so it's clearly not important to the majority of users.
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:19:18

I don't know what his relationship to Blockstream and Core is or isn't, but they sure haven't complained about his censorship much. Why would they, when he's on their side?
@_date: 2015-05-11 14:17:50


@_date: 2016-01-13 15:58:16
The obvious solution is to increase the limit, but due to heavy censorship we can't have an open debate about it on this subreddit. There are alternatives.
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:24:56
And yet they have been allowed to dictate policy until now. We need someone who is both a developer and a politician, not someone who is so blinded by idealism that they fail to see the real-world consequences of their decisions.

LN is kind-of-centralized. It requires someone to act as hub, but it allows many competing hubs to work together and in principle anyone can be a hub.
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:49:10
Not if there's a culture for not accepting or propagating RBF. If the network and the users decide that RBF is undesirable and the miners agree that it opens a can of worms that isn't worth the tiny fee increase it could produce, RBF transactions won't get propagated and won't get mined.
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:16:52

It's usually only a few seconds, still not a problem. This too can be optimized a lot.
I'm not explaining very well why it won't be a problem, just as you aren't giving me any numbers that shows why it will be a problem. We're both guilty of glossing over details here.


Because like I said it's not a big enough problem yet, and the Classic team hasn't had time to prepare for this. 
The community didn't expect the Core developers to be so difficult to reason with. Until last month they didn't even show that they had a clear idea of what to do about it.

I agree that it's hard, and the author has to strike a balance between explaining things himself and referring to existing research papers to back up any claims he makes. Fortunately blogs have comment fields where people can ask for clarifications on points they didn't understand.
I think it's very important to educate people on Bitcoin, and a technical blog can help you explain things not just to non-developers, but also to new developers who need to catch up on it all.
You, or someone else who is qualified, should at least try.

Two problems with a fixed block reward:
1. It would take far too long for the inflation to reach a reasonable level. After 20 years it would still be at 5% per year.
2. If bitcoin succeeds in becoming a global mainstream currency, the value of a bitcoin will be way higher than today. The sums paid out to miners would be outrageous if the block rewards stayed high. It just wouldn't be healthy to pay miners that much.

Skills are permanent and can easily be transferred to a competing technology. Bitcoins could become worthless with little warning. That's why skills are a safer investment than bitcoins.

Interesting analysis. If bitcoin manages to replace national fiat currencies - which is far from certain even if bitcoin succeeds globally - then its deflationary nature will certainly turn some of our current economic assumptions upside down. The great depression showed that sudden high deflation is bad. What about steady low deflation? It remains to be seen. Bitcoin is and will continue to be a giant experiment. That's no paradox.

You should definitely increase the minimum bet. As it is now, it's way too cheap to block someone from winning indefinitely. Just send the minimum amount every time the timer goes below 1 minute, that's about 100 times per day. Once the pot reaches a critical mass there will be too many people doing that and it will be impossible to win. Just as it's currently impossible for "the button" timer to expire without a bug/ddos/network outage.
I suggest you start with a minimum bet of 100 bits and increase it by 1% of the pot after 1 week, 2% after 2 weeks, and so on. That would keep the game interesting.

If miners set their own minimum fees, users will include fees to increase their chances of being included in the next block. Keeping the 1 MB limit on the block size would eventually drive the fees up to unreasonable levels. That would be very bad for adoption.
The only way bitcoin can win is by keeping fees low while scaling to meet global demand.

@_date: 2015-04-15 10:35:04


My point is that mining profitability is overwhelmingly dominated by other factors: Hardware cost, electricity cost, bitcoin price and difficulty. Hardware and electricity determine how competitive you are compared to other miners. Bitcoin price and difficulty determine whether everyone profits or everyone loses. The bitcoin price is outside of miners' control and it's extremely volatile, so small predictable expenses like running a node get drowned out in the noise.


They can, but it isn't their responsibility and they have no reason to. If you're so worried about centralization, run your own damn node.

Sorry, I skipped to the end. Let's rewind:
Reading the [Wikipedia article]( on the subject, it seems that the depression was caused in large part by a huge expansion of the money supply in the 1920s, followed by a contraction of the money supply in the 1930s. Debt was high, cash reserves were low, and the newly established Fed, who was supposed to bail out the banks in case of bank runs, decided not to do its job.
The preface to that disaster was rising productivity but stagnant consumption, and rising unemployment. Had the money supply been kept in check during the 1920s it seems the disaster would have been averted. Reducing it in the 1930s was exactly the wrong thing at the wrong time.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:54:10
We transform resources, we don't create resources from nothing. In order to produce anything, we need food, water, tools, and raw materials. Food is limited because farmland and fresh water are limited. Raw materials are limited for pretty much the same reason. Tools are mainly limited by our ability to create them, but they too need raw materials.

Wrong. Before, the only way to own money electronically was to go through a bank. With bitcoin the bank is a provider of an optional service, available for users' convenience but not required for anything.


Bitcoin is not a cure for fractional reserve practices. MtGox served as a perfect case in point to prove that. It does cure inflation though. If people do a bank run in fiat, the central bank can just print more, causing inflation. If people do a bank run in bitcoin, the banks default instead if they don't have enough reserves.
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:02:30
On the contrary, we need the block reward to decrease further before bitcoin reaches the masses. You think mining is unprofitable now? It's only unprofitable because the difficulty is too damn high. Mining is still the majority of the economic activity in bitcoin except pure speculation. If the masses start using bitcoin, the price will skyrocket and the value of those block rewards will skyrocket along with it.

1. Security. Most people aren't interested in educating themselves about multi-signature, encrypted backups, cold wallets, hardware wallets, all that complicated nerd stuff. Telling them to use an online wallet is asking for them to lose their coins. We need fully insured banks who can take responsibility for the users' coins.
2. Spending bitcoins. I can't go to my local grocery store and pay with bitcoin just by swiping a card and entering a pin. There are cards that let you pay with bitcoin, but the fees are too high for mainstream use.
3. Buying bitcoins. I can't just open a bitcoin account in my bank and buy bitcoins directly by transferring money from a fiat account. I either have to buy at an exchange in another country who require lots of unnecessary paperwork to meet their AML/KYC requirements, or I must pay a huge markup and risk getting robbed/scammed to buy it in cash. I don't believe there's an ATM near me, and even if it were, ATMs also charge outrageous markups.
4. Taxes and regulation. Most countries haven't even made a decision about what bitcoin is. Some of those who have, have made nonsensical decisions that make bitcoin too expensive or too complicated for most people and businesses to bother with.
5. Banks. Many businesses who want to use bitcoin can't because their bank refuses to associate with anything bitcoin related.
6. Scalability. Bitcoin just won't scale globally until we both lift the block size limit and implement good solutions for offloading the blockchain.

They could band together and cook up a solution that's decentralized just like bitcoin, but where they decide the starting parameters and they get a head start on building mining hardware.

First of all I'd invest most of it in real estate and cryptocurrency. There are many places in the world where you can buy an apartment, rent it out to most of the loan payments, and sell it a decade later with good profits. Bitcoin and monero are currently my top picks for cryptos but I watch out for others. I have also bought a piece of Tesla because I believe in Elon Musk, even though Tesla looks incredibly overpriced right now with lots of hype and debt and only small revenue. If SpaceX was public I'd buy that instead, but by the time it goes public it could be worth more than Tesla is now.

From a mainstream user perspective it's "not yet". Bitcoin is still far behind established currencies and payment methods in many respects. What bitcoin can do that fiat can't is let anyone with an internet connection send money to anyone else with an internet connection, regardless of restrictions and without needing a trusted 3rd party. There are some niche use cases where that's useful, for example remittances, darknet markets, and online gambling. Those seem to be the big ones right now. There's also Wikileaks/Snowden donations and paying anonymously for other services online, but I haven't seen evidence of those use cases being very common.
You may not think those niche use cases amount to much, but the bigger picture is that bitcoin is the beginning of a currency revolution. Trustless anonymous online cash is a HUGE invention.

Right now you can indeed buy coffee with bitcoin.
If you assume bitcoin adoption will continue to grow, you should also assume technology will continue to improve. In fact, if you own bitcoins you should hope adoption grows faster than technology can keep up, because that means your bitcoins will continue to multiply in value.

* They don't have to turn their credit/debit card details over to a third party.
* They can pay for things online even if they live in a country where PayPal or credit/debit cards aren't viable options.


That remains to be seen. If bitcoin reaches a critical mass of adoption, its use will skyrocket and today's price ($760 right now) is extremely cheap in comparison.


I believe this is a legitimate threat yes. No existing alt-coins can compete, but I still believe a very powerful entity could create a coin to rival bitcoin, or that a better coin might be developed in the future that could win over users and make bitcoin obsolete.


Bitcoin's value is completely tautological and pure psychology. It has value only as long as people believe it has value. There is nothing that prevents it from losing this value, but as long as there is nothing to *cause* such a loss, it will have value. I won't speculate on what such causes could be, but it obviously hasn't happened yet.

I guess a concern for bitcoins viability would be that if central banks start thinking that bitcoin would be suitable as a reserve currency, they'd instead make and mine their own alt-coin to rival bitcoin.

The relationship between how hard I work to free up money and how much money I manage to free up is one of strongly diminishing returns in the short term.
I don't know how high the risk is. If I discovered information that would cut the risk in half, but still didn't let me know what the new risk was, I should approximately double my valuation of bitcoin. But doing that would matter exactly zero for how much I invest in it, because I already value it much higher than its current price.


I'm talking about all the investors who don't know about it. The more people who learn about bitcoin, the more people invest in it and the higher the price goes.

For small, everyday transactions, it costs more than it's worth to intentionally double spend. Sometimes the chain will fork for a few blocks and you can be the victim of an accidental double spend but it only happens rarely.
For more expensive purchases there's more incentive to try to intentionally double spend. Then I would recommend waiting for at least one confirmation. Additional confirmations increase the cost of a successful double spend, and 6 is generally regarded as safe enough for "anything". 51% attack excluded of course.

I can't speak for the others, but I'm one of the people who think each bitcoin can be worth between $100k and $1M. I also hold more bitcoin than I reasonably should, given the risk and volatility.
As for your Buffet reference, far from everyone expects to get rich. There are some hardcore believers who expect to get rich. There are a lot of sensible individuals who see its potential but are wise enough to also see its risks. Most people though, are either completely ignorant or dismissive, or very skeptical.






It seems like insanity at first glance, because it is completely unprecedented in the history of mankind. However, if bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency and favorite investment object, the only logical conclusion is that everyone who holds some 10-100 bitcoins or more will be filthy rich.
Of course, even if you believe this can happen you should be smart enough to see that there are a lot of known and unknown roadblocks before we get there. Many things could go wrong and send the value to 0. My personal belief is that the potential reward is big enough to justify the risks, and I've backed that belief up by owning some bitcoins. I'm also trying to keep myself informed of risks, and I own tiny amounts of a few alt coins just in case they become popular.
@_date: 2013-10-08 13:19:29


Wrong. More people using bitcoin increases demand for bitcoin even if each person only holds their bitcoin for an hour. When millions of people worldwide each hold a bitcoin or two for an hour each month, that creates a demand for bitcoins that will drive the price up. More people = more demand = higher price.

Nope, doesn't work like that. You still have to wait for a block to be mined.
But the good news is that you probably don't need the transactions to be confirmed, since the sums are likely to be small.

Fair point. Though to really make it effective you need to run the coins through a mixing service afterwards, otherwise the different payments will be traceable in the blockchain after you use them.
However, if the clients are paranoid they will run the coins through a mixing service before spending them. Then they don't have to care what you do with the coins, the coins are still not traceable back to them.
@_date: 2013-10-01 00:30:44
If they fill up the receive address you give them with tiny transactions, it'll still just be one source address when you use it in a transaction, so the fee should be the minimum fee. No matter how many transactions they send to that address. If they keep sending you transactions after you've processed the payment and refunded any fat finger related errors, you're into extreme edge case territory and should turn back to the land of the sane.
And personally I think requiring everyone to provide a return address just in case they send you too much is a bit too cumbersome. You didn't say what kind of service this is, so hopefully it's required for some other purpose.

Yes. Print out your wallet address as QR code and text on paper. Show it to your customer and tell him the price in bitcoins.

I have more than 1 BTC. If I didn't think they were worth more than they currently are, I would just sell them. No need for me to hype them in order to inflate the price.
So when I tell people they might want to buy bitcoin, it is because I believe in bitcoin and I think it's a smart thing to do. And I myself have put my money where my mouth is.
@_date: 2013-10-23 09:03:00
I think the whole idea that people will refuse to spend their bitcoins because they will increase in value is a fallacy. If the market is so sure they will increase in value, it should already have priced them accordingly. The only reason the current price is as low as it is, is because people still think there's a large risk of the price going down.
And if the price was to just keep increasing, there wouldn't be any incentive to invest in businesses. That would choke off the supply of goods and services, causing the prices of goods and services to increase - which means the purchasing power, i.e. value, of the currency would decrease.
So you see, it all regulates itself. The more people hoard, the less incentive people will have to hoard.

Bitcoin will only succeed if people keep believing it will. It's all mass psychology, something I know nothing about.

From the network's perspective, the cost of mining is the total mining revenue paid to miners.
From the perspective of each miner, the cost of mining is electricity cost + depreciation of the hardware they use.

What if, instead of being hoarded, the coins were lost. Their private keys deleted. Do you also insist that would be bad for bitcoin?
You are right that people must use bitcoin in transactions, for bitcoin to be a functioning currency. The mistake you seem to make is assuming that one person's hoarding somehow prevents another person's spending. As more and more coins are hoarded, the value of the coins in circulation increase. Since bitcoins are infinitely divisible* the remaining circulating coins will always be enough to meet the needs of the economy.

Currently I gather them all in one wallet that I'm very paranoid about protecting. I generated the wallet on a clean linux install, and immediately encrypted it with a very strong password that I made sure I will never forget (short of brain death or serious retrograde amnesia). I then made 3 copies of the wallet and stored them on computers in 3 different countries (in addition to the linux computer in by basement). I rarely touch this wallet, and never on a computer I think has any risk of having a keylogger or trojan on it.
I plan on creating another wallet to use for everyday spending, with less paranoid security, but I don't need it yet. The fewer passwords I have to remember the better.


No. I think Litecoin is a pointless fad and will flop. I do own some Primecoins, because it at least has a novel feature that I believe has merit and distinguishes it from other coins.

What most investors don't know is that bitcoin exists and has great potential.

In fact, if you [search for them on reddit]( you'll see that they've already been outed as scammers 2 months ago. I'm sorry about your loss, but hopefully you will take this lesson to heart and do better research before you trust strangers with your money in the future.

And keep some coins stored away somewhere. So you don't miss out if bitcoin really takes off.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:59:43
That was from $30 down to $2. The first time ever that the price was above $300 was earlier this month.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:40:45
But will 1000 to 2000 be quicker than 500 to 1000?
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:48:16
It would be much less obvious than what's going on now. It would also be harder to find out where the money went afterwards, since any user who legitimately won money during that time is a potential suspect.

Same as any other contract breach - it depends on where that person lives and whether you can get the authorities to do anything.


Write the receiving address and the amount due in the contract.

If he didn't receive the profit from SR, who did? It seems reasonable he'd keep a low profile. If I had a bunch of coins gained illegally I wouldn't dare spending them even after they were laundered. I'd just store them somewhere safe and wait until I was sure I could spend them anonymously.

SEPA withdrawals in EUR take about 5 weeks right now. I've heard that SEPA withdrawals in GBP are fast. Polish domestic withdrawals are also supposedly fast (PLN I assume). Japanese domestic (JPY) are also fast.
Wire withdrawals are slow, regardless of currency. It sounds like your EUR withdrawal is a Wire transfer.
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:27:06
Also because it means higher market cap, which gives bitcoin legitimacy and attracts bigger investors. Bigger investors will invest more to develop and promote bitcoin as a transactional currency, not just an investment object.

All wires are equally clogged up.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:16:46
You're wrong. Given equal investment of processing power, faster blocks give faster security.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:04:18
I guess we could partition the address space and make the block chain "multithreaded" so to speak. Rely on eventual consistency rather than completely synchronized snapshots every block.
@_date: 2013-10-26 09:53:04
If buying didn't increase the price, how would it increase? If the price never increased, why would anyone buy except to spend?
@_date: 2013-09-30 20:01:00
Domestic JPY transfer is the best option (reasonably fast and cheaper than BTC right now).
BTC is the most expensive option, since the mtgox price is currently about 12% higher than the other big exchanges.
EUR SEPA is reported to take 1 month, but I suspect that delay to increase.
USD Wire is so slow as to be pointless right now, and nobody knows when mtgox will solve the problem.
There are rumours of a manual "emergency" wire transfer at 5% fee, and if that's true it may be a good option since it's cheaper than doing a BTC transfer. I wouldn't depend on it though.
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:57:48
I second this. I use Bitstamp (I'm in Europe). I think it's a good place to buy since they seem trustworthy, have large volume and lower prices than MtGox.
@_date: 2013-10-16 10:02:16
Are you sure? Any large entity with craploads of money and influence can create an alt-coin, promote it heavily, invest in innovation and services surrounding it, and drive its price so high that people will start using it. It'll cost less than acquiring the equivalent amount of bitcoins. It could blow Bitcoin completely out of the water.
@_date: 2013-10-23 08:28:57
Large benefit to early adopters =&gt; more early adopters =&gt; faster adoption. Without it, Bitcoin might never have become as popular as it is.

At 10k my net worth will be comparable to my parents'.  
At 100k I can retire comfortably.  
At 1M I'll be filthy rich.
These are significant milestones to me. Anything in between is just OCD-lite.

It was a bit manic when it went from 170 to 195 on mtgox. Now it's sane again.
@_date: 2013-10-01 08:01:51
It seems you're right. Apparently I've musunderstood some things about how transactions work. Thank you for setting me straight.

On the contrary, I screwed up plenty of times. I still do. Every time I do, I learn something.

Don't expect it any time soon. I recommend asking support to cancel the withdrawal snd withdraw BTC or another currency (using SEPA or .jp domestic).
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:57:12
Because this price increase is the result of stuff that's happened over the last week and month, not just Branson's announcement.
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:18:27
I didn't. But what I do is keep a close eye on the price and volume charts whenever the price goes ballistic.. because every time it does, it's followed by a sharp drop afterwards. If I can sell near the top and buy in lower, I can profit. It's not easy though..
@_date: 2013-10-01 00:42:28
Cute barista. Nice to see bitcoin gaining publicity.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:32:44
Good luck enforcing that. I guess I'll just keep my bitcoins hidden in "offshore accounts" until they change the regulation..
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:24:58
Yeah cash out some, invest some, and keep some for later. You'll regret selling all of them if they become worth 1M each.

Exchange rate is meaningless. Market cap/narrow money is what matters.

I think the line should be drawn higher than yours. We may be above the curve right now, but not by nearly as much as your graph indicates.

It makes much more sense if you look at a logarithmic graph of bitcoin price for the last 3 years.

Unless you lose or break your phone. I assume you don't have much in that wallet so it's no big deal if you lose it. If/when you start dealing with serious quantities I recommend you make a more secure wallet and store multiple encrypted backups in different physical locations.

Good catch. I didn't realize there were so many new coins since April.

Not a chance. Bitcoin is dominant and Litecoin gives people no incentive to switch. No reason for people to invest in it or prefer it to bitcoin.
It has two minor selling points. Faster blocks is one, but it's not significant enough to matter. Scrypt is another, but the only people who thinks it's good are GPU miners. They like it because it means they can keep profiting on mining. When people stop buying LTC, the miners will be stuck with worthless coins and worthless hardware. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:15:59
A pool withholds newly mined blocks from the rest of the network, and if the rest of the network finds a block before the pool finds a second block, the pool releases its block and spreads it with a Sybil attack.
This way they will cause the rest of the network to waste mining power on orphaned blocks. The next time difficulty readjusts to the sabotaged hash rate, the pool's profits increase.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:45:25
If you're scared it sounds like 10 BTC is more than you can afford to lose. I think you should consider how much you can own and not care much if you lose it, and then aim to own that much. Then stop paying attention for a few years.
And I recommend you take measures to ensure your coins remain accessible to you and only you. My approach was to generate a wallet on a fresh linux install, encrypt the wallet using a good, strong password that I know I will never forget, and store backups of the encrypted wallet in multiple locations. Choosing a good, memorable password is difficult, do not skimp on password security.
A paper wallet can get stolen or destroyed. I would not trust a paper wallet unless it was encrypted and backed up in multiple locations.
@_date: 2013-10-16 12:58:21
They wouldn't have to control it though. Just acquire a decent portion of it and let the community take over, encouraged by heavy monetary incentives.
They could even provide guarantees against price crashes.
@_date: 2013-10-10 12:24:14
Whaaaat!? Why haven't I heard of this before? Is it true for other non-usd currencies as well or just GBP?
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:19:04
Those are the same advantages Primecoin holds over Litecoin. By that logic, Primecoin should replace both Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Actually it's 144,341 from DPR + 29,657 from Silk Road. Edited my post to reflect this. They have the keys to all of those coins, because they've been moved to FBI controlled addresses.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:41:46
They can't buy all the bitcoins. If they try, they will just drive up the price of the remaining coins and bitcoin will go on as if nothing happened.

I didn't say make many small bets, I said win small amounts with each username.

Risky and smart. At least those of us who invested because we believe in bitcoin and understand why its upside is much greater than its risk.

The biggest and by far most important difference is that bitcoin is the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. This gives bitcoin a legitimacy that litecoin and the other alt-coins lack.
In my opinion, litecoin's other differences are not meaningful enough to give it merit. People who have invested in it will of course tell you otherwise.
