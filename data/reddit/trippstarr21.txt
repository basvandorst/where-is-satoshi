Lol true true. Yolo. I’m trying to get out of the oilfield though so I can spend more time with momma and daughter
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:28:24
So I can buy fractions here and there at 19k then 17k and so on and it just gets put all together adding to that 1 bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:42:13
It will be at 11k by jan 2nd..or that’s what they told me
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:29:00
Thank you. I’ll look into it. I work a crazy schedule so hopefully I’ll hear my alerts when they drop hits lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:36:02
Well I’m thinking of putting my income tax also after I pay off my remaining debt towards it also lol so we’ll see. But yeah I doubt I’ll ever own one. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:57:05
Bahahaha. We shall see 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:51
Sense...makes none of it? If you mined it back in the day when a dime bag costed a dime..why would you be buying now?
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:23:44
True. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:23:59
Thank you brah. Appreciate it 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:42:53
Geez. That’s awesome man congratulations. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:38:55
Seems legit
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:21:11
Is there a way you all know when the dip hits? Notifications or just constantly hawking it?
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:27:17
Thank you. Do you all stick to bitcoin only or do all 3 from Coinbase? I get confused reading the steps with transferring it to another place then back an forth lol I guess I have a lot more reading to do 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:13:17
Which app is best for a complete noob to start buying? I see Coinbase isn’t good but to use gdx or whatever then I see that coinbase is best but customer service sucks? I’m liking to throw 10-20 bucks a day maybe. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:25:46
When bitcoin drops and you pay your bills so you have to wait to your next paycheck. Fml
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:22:51
Oh ok gotcha. I plan on putting in 100 a month maybe more give or take. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:01:23
Lol no you’re pretty spot on. You forgot lifted trucks 4 wheelers exotic pets and guns. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 13:13:55
Is this a good time to buy btc if I’ve never bought some before? Or should I wait till it drops to the 3000s again? I usually just buy millions of shares of alts but never btc
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:29:29
You won’t be happy if you buy at 20k then it drops to 3k
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:58:13
Changed it. Thnx
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:08:06
Good first time to buy some bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:53:29
Have a question since I’m a noob. So lets say I buy 20 bucks worth of Btc on coinbase at 6700 bucks..it’s currently 7300..if I sell I lose money lol how much does it have to go up to gain money when selling? Coinbase takes its fee..so do you wait for it go up up couple thousand to make any profit?
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:43:21
So If I already have coinbase with my bank account set up and cash app which do you prefer to buy from if I’m new to the game? I  want to buy bitcoin just wondering.
@_date: 2019-12-29 04:05:02
True that. Maybe I’ll just keep buying and hold till 2021.
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:11:12
On mine it says 17.93. But with the fees. Let’s say I buy a full btc today at 7300 and let’s say it goes up to 7500-7700. I’ll still come out behind cause of the coinbase fees correct? Cause it will take out more %
@_date: 2019-12-29 05:56:31
Where can I go for that
