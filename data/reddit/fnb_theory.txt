Also, great work on the library!

Hey man, any ideas on how to achieve this using BIP 70 and the library? I see on the github page there is a mention of the possibility but no guide explains how to make use of it.

Hey man, I just found your post on blockchain.info and clicked through to your site without even thinking and decided, what the hell, let's just buy some licorice.
Quite honestly, that was the smoothest experience I've ever had, to buy anything online. I am not even joking. I would literally be in financial debt if everything were that smooth online. It took me no less than 30/40 seconds to go from clicking on "add to cart" to actually processing the transaction with my bitcoin wallet. This is by far a hell of a lot easier than using my credit card or anything of the like to process the payment.
I didn't even check if you ship to my country, if not, I don't even care :D

I couldn't agree more. I'm not going to use Coinbase because of the negative amount of press it's getting without it directly addressing and/or providing a strong stance in the way forward.
I wouldn't want my account to be frozen because of something as stupid as that. Let alone be ignored about accessing my own money/finances.

The blockchain understands the sub account's address and nothing more. It cannot relate the two and neither can anybody else. Nobody can go from the bitcoin address back to either the private key or the BIP 32/39 key (which is probably what is being used). Meaning they cannot figure out what sub accounts you have, how they are related etc.
EDIT: Subsequently, everything is being managed by your wallet internally and only it knows that you have those sub accounts (essentially). If they are using BIP 32/39 you can re-create those sub accounts in other wallets that support BIP 32/39.
Otherwise, they are just random private keys.

Apple is not going to be pro bitcoin because it goes against their own Apple pay system which they don't really want. I haven't liked Circle from the beginning because it really did sound like the typical corporate approach to new tech.

Source: [Bitcoin Wiki](
Each bitcoin gives the holder the ability to embed a large number of short in-transaction messages in a globally distributed and timestamped permanent data store, namely the bitcoin blockchain. There is no other similar datastore which is so widely distributed. There is a tradeoff between the exact number of messages and how quickly they can be embedded. But as of December 2013, it's fair to say that one bitcoin allows around 1000 such messages to be embedded, each within about 10 minutes of being sent, since a fee of 0.001 BTC is enough to get transactions confirmed quickly. This message embedding certainly has intrinsic value since it can be used to prove ownership of a document at a certain time, by including a one-way hash of that document in a transaction. Considering that electronic notarization services charge something like $10/document, this would give an intrinsic value of around $10,000 per bitcoin.
While some other tangible commodities do have intrinsic value, that value is generally much less than its trading price. Consider for example that gold, if it were not used as an inflation-proof store of value, but rather only for its industrial uses, would certainly not be worth what it is today, since the industrial requirements for gold are far smaller than the available supply thereof.
In any event, while historically intrinsic value, as well as other attributes like divisibility, fungibility, scarcity, durability, helped establish certain commodities as mediums of exchange, it is certainly not a prerequisite. While bitcoins are accused of lacking 'intrinsic value' in this sense, they make up for it in spades by possessing the other qualities necessary to make it a good medium of exchange, equal to or better than commodity money.
Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc... Just like a phone is necessary to transmit vocal information through the network, a bitcoin is necessary to transmit economic information through the network.
Value is ultimately determined by what people are willing to trade for - by supply and demand.

I've been trying to wrap my head around the code for the better part of last week. I don't need the full implementation, basically just the  part of it but I can't find any specific examples for it anywhere on the web.

This is literally placing monetary value on people's lives. As in, you'd be able to define what a person is worth, not just by what he owns but by how others perceive him.
That also has some very, very dark ethical issues.

Also, out of all the posts I've read, I've only come across the mention of this "boogeyman" the darknet. Not Bitcoin.
Until the media starts going down the bitcoin road, we shouldn't be spreading rumours.

I think that that decision is incredibly short sited. Not from a pro bitcoin point of view but in general. She has set a precedent here that is very likely going to turn out to be the wrong one.
Of course one could argue that she made the decision without fully understanding the intricacies but I think she could've at least spent more time on trying to figure out a proper solution than to dismiss it that quickly.
