Thanks I have a few already but the ephemeral nature of paper has me a little pessimistic. Not to say a laptop wont be dated in 2 years locked in cold storage...

You raised a few great points. My family isnt even the type to figure out a qr code let alone save encryption keys and have redundant backups. :(  Back to the drawing board.

Since Squarespace uses stripe as its payment processor, I'd love to see them enable that. I know I've been dieing to add that support to my site.

I have a few paper wallets with BIP38 ready to go but, I am pretty capable in these areas but a bit shaky when it comes to encryption methods on paper wallets.
I am looking for more of an easy solution for my family members that may be less technically inclined and that can double as more of a live wallet in a pinch.
I am leaning towards the cell phone wallet ATM but doubt it can be as secure as a paper wallet.

Yeah they use a community wallet and can pull your coins at any time.

Bad news for preorderers good news for current mining generation.
