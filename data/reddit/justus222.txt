I'm not sure why an original miner would sell a ton of coins for a little over $1000 each, unless there was some other incentive. Perhaps they offered him stock options, or something even better?
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:29:17
Great, thanks for the info! How would this compare against Authy, a 2FA application for my phone which generates a unique or semi-unique PIN number every time I log in?
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:08:01
Why is this an important term to be using with Bitcoin? I understand that it's important to talk about how long BTC have sat in storage, but why do we talk about it like this?
@_date: 2014-01-11 19:42:04
Which makes sense, because I don't like having random change o

Dancing in a Sombrero.
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:46:34
Is this related to a "fork" somehow?
Edit: Also, what if someone theoretically had close to 21 million BTC and did a 51% attack? Would there be 42 million BTC in the Network due to double spend?
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:27:31
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:16:16
I don't know a ton about this mining, but isn't the mining cost split in the pool? Also BTC price was like $250 or $300 in October/November, has mining cost really gone up so much since them?

@_date: 2014-01-01 05:50:14
Gotchya. Exchanges are not liquid enough to handle huge whales cashing out at once, because by the time they get 1/10 of the way done, they'd cause the price to fall. Plus exchanges have limits.

What is even going on in this thread?

That's not a bad point man. If I had over say $5-10,000 in BTC, I'd make a full time job of securing it safe as possible.

I buy and sell on Amazon, and I would love to pay with BTC instead of Fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:26:22
Well I'm talking long game, as in Satoshi's reaching parity with a fiat dollar.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:44:06
The thing is that I don't think it's a bubble. If we halve in value and drop to $500 randomly, there would still be huuuuuge amounts of buy orders.
Everyone here would probably buy .5 or 1 BTC at least. So even if it corrects it will stabilize for a while. I'm not sure we will ever see $800 again.
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:41:37

Awesome. Very cool individual.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:22:06
Wait...do you get to keep .45 BTC a day?? I never really looked into mining. But that sounds too good to be true for a ~$1000 investment.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:11:24
Edit: misread OPs usable wallets statistic.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:56:23
But back to the point, how can they not sell it to him if he had the chedder for it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:52:25
Yeah, or sell like 1 or 2 to help ease the next semester or two.... but no way would I sell 11 BTC for 11Gs right now. That is not even much student debt.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:52:17
I agree mainstream exposure is vital. I think there's a big untapped market in people who are aware of fiat debt problems, and yet have never heard of BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:34:19
Great points. How quickly did you recover your initial overhead for mining? Is it still worth it now?
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:51:11
What do you mean by "valid"? Like secure?  Multibit generates wallets, then it is up to you to encrypt it (which is a whole nother discussion). Selling and receiving is very easy compared to trading on big exchanges/securing wallet/understanding concepts. Unless by selling you mean trading back to fiat, which is meh.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:59:53
Dude, I gained +3 programming understanding from that. Thank you.

I agree. Or ask a very detailed security question for any transfer over X amount, with a time delay.

Isn't blockchain the actual term for the payment network?
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:06:17
He is right, although the formatting is horrible. PR does infiltrate Reddit, if you don't think so, you are uninformed.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:58:17
If there are millions (billions?) Of other keys that unlock our addresses, what is preventing a group of people from focusing on unlocking, say, the top 10 wallets?
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:45:08
I've been thinking this. Someone could easily condense the problems with our current debt based system, the benefits to Bitcoin, and the easiest way to adapt.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:27:50
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:57:38
Yeah we hit $550 last week then rallied to $1000 again...

Dude, that was beautiful.
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:18:43
If you've already heard it, move on. Personally, I am very interested in talking about the ramifications of Bitcoin tech, which are extremely interesting. It's pretty clear that BTC is new territory, thus worthy of discussion. And remember, there is a distinction between circle jerking and talking about cutting edge technology.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:45:29
By personal wallets do you mean clients like Electrum and Multibit?
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:13:40
Or just use mBTC, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:19:53
Exactly. Same with Government. Yes, Gov and banks (theoretically) may be able to get a large amount of people to enter a Gov. backed Crypto, but it would be centralized and subject to all the fun that comes with that. People who entered BTC because they like the idea, will still continue to use it. The potential $5 Billion annual remittance market would not benefit from centralized cryptos, but from BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:59:48
Same here, and correct me if I'm wrong, but Coinbase accepts your buy price at the current price, then delivers BTC to you at the price you bought it at, not the current rate that day.
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:31:10
Exactly. Let's not forget that we "choose" the President with a smaller percentage than that.
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:28:44
Right. Who doesn't want to own 1000 of something? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:04:29
Dude....that gave me an idea for a sci-fi novel. What if computors go down completely, and the only currency we can use is a cryptocurrency based on algebra/calculus on paper. Could people invent a crypto based on paper problems?

Wow. Much award.

I see. My understanding of the China news is that merchants can still accept it, and people can still buy goods with it. Therefore, it's still a currency, just not one that can be accepted by banks. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:47:45
This is an excellent video. I was planning on just skimming it for 5 mins, but watched it all through without stopping. I know a good amount about BTC and it was still made me think a lot.
 He really breaks it down in a unique way, and touches on almost all the major issues in layman's terms (except the potential hashing problems he only mentions at the end- I'm still not clear on how those could effect the blockchain?)
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:08:08
Would a series of 10-13 random letters and numbers I chose be more or less secure than a series of 5-6 random common words I chose? Thank you.

You get verified quickly if you have a checking account number. But transactions will still have a 4 day delay. If you go up to level 3, and link a CREDIT, not debit/check card, you can do instant buy/sell.

If you are reading this forum that shouldn't be too hard.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:56:05
Not everyone is in it solely for the pseudo-anonymity. Which is admittedly a really great feature of BTC, but is not the selling point.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:16:44
I can't see this as bad. Was not Bitcoin invented partially to avoid the craziness and sketchyness of banking institutions? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:16:50
Or was a group of people.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:19:07
Preach it.

@_date: 2013-11-30 07:47:29


That's what I've been saying tho. I want to use a proper exchange, but btc-e is shady, and I don't understand it enough to put in big amounts. I may transfer .03 there to get a feel for how it works.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:06:25
...it's @_date: 2013-12-07 08:35:34
This is essentially the simplest answer. Bitcoin is anonymous. You can't read the blockchain transactions and place money to names. You can see that a wallet has so much money, but you can't figure out whose it is easily. Coinbase, or BTC-e can tie your wallet to a bank account, but BTC-e is not Bitcoin. So Bitcoin is anonymous, but banking/exchange/etc institutions aren't.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:47:04
How much did he drop?
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:34:16
Ha, I can't tell if he was saying that, or just commentating on the volatility of BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:09:44
I agree, but LTC is only risky if BTC does not keep rising. As long as we keep seeing stable growth in BTC, LTC can be a stable investment, but it doesn't have anywhere near the adoption of BTC, since you can't really do anything with it except hold, speculate, and maybe buy some random tech gadgets on a few sites.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:10:39
Right....I'm not terribly surprised that a huge statist nation is banning a currency that undermines state economic agility.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:49:02


As an Amazon seller, can confirm. Amazon can be extremely conservative with rolling out new features, or taking risks that can lose customers. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:06:23
Thanks. That is pretty helpful. How much entropy would a series of made up English words have, such as Skuldgrex Rekfrlit Mehoj, or something weird like that?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:49:31
I bought in at $1100 and I'm not worried
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:21:22


The real question is whether the rates of these activities will be higher with BTC or not. There is clearly already tons of this even with centralized oversight.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:22:28
Scary thought. 30,000 BTC locked out of the market forever. Especially as value rises and those BTC become more than some nation's GDP. I'm guessing very few were lost though- those are all early miners and proponents of BTC I'm guessing, plus a some big investors. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:39:03
Thank you for posting! Could you please explain quickly if there is a middle ground between buying a cold storage laptop and storing in a client on your daily PC? I feel like getting some amazing keylogger detectors and anti-virus hooked up, and not being stupid with browsing, could negate the need for that? Since the electrum client is pretty secure when encrypted with a passcode? Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:54:58
It's an easy one to play out easily, but when reserved for special occasions, totally hilarious. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:48:18
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:22:48
It's easy to buy it with Coinbase, etc., but it takes a lot more work to teach good browsing habits to people who can't easily recognize adware links/sites and don't run decent malware/virus protection. Also there is a little learning curve with explaining what it is/why it is better.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:06:44


Could you explain this? What do you mean by people speculating on little used forks?
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:39:00
These sound like Monopoly Community Chest cards.
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:46:15
Haha I haven't played one in years... Would be fun!

Buy $5 and hold until $500000.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:12:59
That is scary, but I don't see how they could enforce people only using a Gubbermint wallet. Unless regulation happened *before * widescale adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:44:00
....Right, so we are all agreeing that 12.5 million people potentially reading about Bitcoin can't hurt long term.
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:23:15
That is very interesting. And I understand that I wouldn't choose them truly randomly unless I entered a ton of made up words into a generator and rolled a bunch of times.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:21:18
Can I do this with Electrum?

Could you please ELI5 what a Yubikey does, and how easy/useful it is? Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:14:26


Very true. This will be a huge hurdle for us in the BTC world. I am computer literate to a degree, understand the basic terms and concepts behind them, and I still had to spend a good chunk of time understanding the different concepts and security features. Not that Grandma has to understand blockclains fully etc, but some of this stuff is important.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:42:34
Could you expand on your last paragraph please?
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:14:29
Hm, do you know any more about the telecom revolution in Africa? Never heard of that, but it's really interesting, since I was wondering how Bitcoin could expand to 3rd world countries.

FBA is still 3rd Party Sellers, who store and ship from Amazon warehouses.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:14:01
Ah I see. Thank you for the answer. Would clients like Blockchain, Multibit, Electrum generate you an already used wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:09:34
Thank you, I Googled but couldn't find a def. And that's why I'm hesitant to invest in any of them, even though a few of them are pump and dumped pretty effectively. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:59:18


Wait....is dogecoin actually real?
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:25:35
People don't get this.... Why say you'd pay .2 Btc when that could mean either $210, $190, $140, etc. Not everyone wants to check the price constantly to crosscheck what .2 means. Bitcoin needs stability clearly, but that won't come from simply referring to things in BTC instead of fiat imho.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:25:57
Can you generate a wallet that already has funds? I thought this was impossible.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:53:40
Same here. I tried before the $250 jumpoff, but couldn't figure it out/researched way too much instead of just trying to buy some....smh. Oh well, in now.
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:04:04
Gotchya. Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:35:06
Also most people don't keep their BTC on the site.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:38:08
What I don't get is how it's "bad" for China Bank to not accept Bitcoin. I assumed that everyone who gets into BTC understands how half it's value is in the non-regulatory, non debt based essence of it. Who would want to trust a bank with BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:36:52
Same here :) And yeah, I tend to do that sometimes haha.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:43:32
Thanks bro
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:08:40
Are there any other examples of nations with multiple currencies in official use? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:57:52
Gotchya. And the blockchain size/transaction limit is one of the main technical issues with Bitcoin protocol correct? I agree, Bitcoin is nowhere near ready for mass market, and losing 20,000 permanently is messed up. But utter responsibility for your money is the price of not enabling banks/the government to gamble with and steal your money.

This summer I took a trip to Nevada to go hiking with a friend. We rented a car from an off-name company. 60 miles outside the city, the whole tire basically shifted and turned 20 degrees down. We pulled over and had to get towed back. When we contacted the car rental agency for a refund, it took 4/5 days to clear our money back to our East Coast bank.
 There was not enough in this account to cover renting another car immediately. We had cash, but car rentals are tricky, and you can't just pay for one with cash, all funds have to be on the credit card of the person renting the vehicle, and we couldn't deposit cash into our East coast bank account easily. So basically 4-5 days of our vacation were spent not hiking because of banking and credit card waits. 
If all parties had Bitcoin, we could have gotten an instant refund from the dealer, and rented another car immediately from another agency.
