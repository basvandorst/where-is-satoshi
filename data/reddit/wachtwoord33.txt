YES! So much this. Increasing the block size directly means sacrificing security. We have the most secure payment network ever by many orders of magnitude which is basically not influence by any state or group on the planet, even if several would cooperate.
Don't throw that away to be able to buy a damn coffee on the chain. That type of purchase does not need 1st class security (in fact it needs no security at all). Bitcoin is for large wealth transfers.

I think gavin doesn't want to be controlled. But what to do when they threaten your family? You fuck up on purpose and claim you tried your best. His economic arguments were laughable so I think he's been trying to tell us he's been compromised. He even backed "Satoshi" with absolutely zero proof. I don't think Gavin is THAT stupid.
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:10:51
It's still MASSIVELY overvalued though. ETH worth nearly worth $1B? Go feel your forehead. Bitcoin's intrinsic vale is at least 100 times higher than ETH and probably more.
@_date: 2016-08-31 14:14:49
That was exactly what I would be referring to as dumb (apologies for the fucking retarded, was uncalled for and only shows I lost patience). It's completely unimportant what Gavin (or anyone) thinks. If someone, anyone, shows the ability to sign any arbitrary message with a key belonging to Satoshi this conclusively proves he either is Satoshi or stole his keys. 
Why would someone of the development need to confirm this?
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:04:30
Well my theory is that some groups that would like to see Bitcoin die funded the other side of the debate. Gavin seems to be in the bag of the CIA ever since his visit there years ago. Of course the above is merely speculation (and considered "conspiracy theory" by most), but as you say: the point is so easy to see.
Another reason is how the Bitcoin community has changed over the years. It started with a generally intelligent group of libertarians (I fit that category). But as Bitcoin has become more popular it has become saturated with the general group of socialist sheep that infect modern society and demand "democracy", that "everyone's vote should count no matter how much Bitcoin you own", that "Bitcoin should be accessible to everyone, not just the rich" and other left-wing propaganda. 
It's likely a combination of the two: The groups with an interest in attacking Bitcoin manipulated the group of stupid sheep to do their bidding. I'm very happy that Bitcoin seems to have overcome its very first existential threat :)
@_date: 2016-08-29 14:44:32
If they pay for their transactions they aren't a problem. That's another reason why the block size needs to remain what it is so the fees go up and the 'problem' solves itself.

I might have misunderstood the article (and if I have this whole comment will likely be moot), but this sounds like the biggest security hole ever. A signature proves that the owner of the private keys of the inputs agrees to this transaction. The more nodes store this proof the safer as without it everyone can spend from any Bitcoin address. 
If you mean that this is just for making the implementation of non-full nodes easier please don't. This will make many people switch from full to non-full node and undermine and centralize the verification strength of the Bitcoin network as after that the voice against a blocksize increase will be smaller.
Your talking about redesigning in an altcoin right? Please go ahead and do so.
I really hope I misunderstood cause Pieter is still in my good guys camp :)
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:40:17
I will react later as I'm on my phone now but I think we agree a lot. We disagree on a few crucial points:
* I wouldn't care that much about an increase to 2 mb if this would not create a precedent. Block size will keep increasing ad infinitum and previous increases will even be used as an argument for yet another increase until Bitcoin's utility is 0.
Look at the increase of defecits of nations. This is why I refer to the 21 M block size limit as I think it is as important as the block size limit.
* I think at the current size the transaction system is not that important anymore. Also, it will not collapse as you say  but merely be restricted to the highest priority transactions. If you pay enough you'll get your place in a block.
Excuse the typos and thanks for the civil discussion on this topic :)

Centralized, owned by a company who btw own &gt; 95% of all the XRP (and insta awarded this to themselves), no mining, it's not even a crypto. XRP tokens are hardly needed to have any value if their IOU trust network ever takes off at any rate.
The only reason the price is so high is because the company holds back most of the supply from the market. It really shows a lack of general intelligence if you buy XRP.

I'm camp D. I agree that if the people that want to change our rules won't just fork the chain and make an "altcoin" with their rules machine guns are the only solution. (the only exception is if we come up with a dynamic block size limit which is not gameable by any of the parties).

@_date: 2015-12-30 16:46:30
It's important to note my apathy comes primarily from fear of people destroying this great thing.
You mention 8 points.
1. I'm fine with people using it as such in the short term. I just don't want to change (weaken imo) the system to accommodate it
2. Moving $100M is easy today if you hold $100M in Bitcoin and want to continue to hold that. You need to do nothing except get you and your private key out of the location you're in. Satoshi has probably done this already.
3. It doesn't need to be the only. I just don't want to risk that use case at all, since that alone justifies a market cap orders of magnitude above today. Why be greedy? (let other cryptos develop for other use cases, I'll cheer them on)
4. fees will not work from one day to the next. The continuous rising fees over time have made me value Bitcoin higher and higher because it makes it more likely a fee market will develop. So yes, fees do increase the value of Bitcoin according to my valuation technique which may differ from yours.
5. Miners are each others competitors and miners of large size have different incentives than smaller ones. The incentives of the large ones are large at odds with Bitcoin as a whole (but these are currently nicely counterbalanced with the rigid set of rules). 
Miners will indeed reject 0 fee tx at some point. 1 Satoshi might be enough for acceptance however.
6. Able to change itself when needed is important. Willing to compromise it's core values is not. In that respect I like to refer to the 21 M BTC limit. If that is ever changes I liquidate 100% of my Bitcoin holdings (into what is of course a very good question).
If people want different rules, fork Bitcoin (with an initial distribution equal to Bitcoins current coin distribution as Peter R suggested years ago) and create an altcoin.
7. No-one should decide what it is other than the free market and the initial set of rules. Those two combined will result in a settlement system.
8. I'm glad we agree. I think centralization is already unhealthy low so with respect to that I would prefer a reduction of the blocksize over an increase. (I am not suggesting a reduction of course, that would be arguing against myself).
@_date: 2015-12-31 08:25:13
This is so much more important than eorrying anout blocks getting full. Thanks OP for showing where the focus should be!
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:11:18
There exist many reasons. Firstly, increasing the block size now would create a dangerous precedent to keep doing so in the future. The only way for there to be a reason for fees to be paid is limited block size. If it has been increased it will be increased again (just think how you would react if someone wanted to increase the supply from 21M to 21.1M? Terrible right? Because of the precedent not the economic impact).
Secondly, there is the economic impact. Fees are rising because the limit is being approach. If we increase the limit now it's centralized intervention which disrupts the entire equilibrium which is developing. I know it's very common in today's society to do centralized planning but it's extremely suboptimal and Bitcoin was a way to escape that. A true free market. Proponents of an increase of the block size are proposing to destroy that.
The largest differentiating quality of Bitcoin is a truly secure store of wealth (not a transaction system it sucks for that). So this feature must be optimized! An increase of the block size will decrease the eventual security. The eventual security will be a function of the total economic value of Bitcoin, the desired transaction force and the blocksize (capacity). A doubling of the block size will have a huge negative effect on the eventual security of Bitcoin.
Visiting back that Bitcoin is not an efficient way to have a global transaction system used by everyone. It's terribly inefficient for that. You don't need a trillion dollar system to secure your $1 coffee purchase. You do need it for your $100M trust fund. Or to move $100M to another jurisdiction when your country collapses. (see also: 
Finally there is centralization. Hash rate is only half the story when we talk about security. There are people with guns in this world who use violence to get what they want and we must protect against that. Also power corrupts. The only method we have to protect against both of these is decentralization. Bigger blocks increase centralization (less people will run full clients, only miners with huge scale can run economically etc.) and thus endanger Bitcoin as well. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:52:00
1 MB is the magic number because it is what was chosen. If Satoshi chose 8 MB back in the day I'd be defending that today. It shouldn't shouldn't be changed as it creates a precedent for increasing the supply.
The same is true for the 21 M BTC. The 21 M is not important, 5, 9M or 121T would work just as well. We shouldn't change it though as it creates a precedent of increasing the supply.
We need a fee market to protect the network. As we're building down the subsidy so too should the fee level rise. We have some catching up to do.

Encryption algorithms lie at the heart of Bitcoin. How do you think you verify a transaction? By cryptographically signing it. 
With the same mechanism you can also encrypt messages. Every Bitcoin address is a public key with which you can encrypt a message which is only decryptable by the owner of that Bitcoin address.
If they 'ban' encryption (LOL, good luck) they effectively ban Bitcoin.

I'm not dictating anything, just sticking to the contract.
Simple optimization shows "they" (the miners) want to receive infinite fees while transaction issuers want to pay 0. A fee market should dictate what the fee actually is. For that, a finite resource (block size) is required. We cannot extend that at will (cause it will set a precedent) so it needs to stay at whatever it is now. 
The only exception is if we replace it with a dynamic (non-hard coded) block size which is not game-able by any actor in the system. Since I haven't seen anyone come up with such a dynamic function I stick with the 1 MB we have.
@_date: 2015-12-29 11:17:11
They will accept that because 1 Satoshi is more than zero and adding one more transaction doesn't take much calculation. If you don't take the money another miner will as they are competing with each other.

If it's still there what is the value of putting it somewhere else? Isn't the idea to leave it out?

This takes the run-up to 256, the crash to 64 and the subsequent rise to ~1100 in 2013 as 1 cycle. In fact the crash 256-&gt;64 is a separate one with much shorter recovery time invalidating this whole extrapolation.
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:26:49
It changes the cycle duration as he measures it so surely it invalidates the exact extrapolation. On top of that, he's trying to show cycle length increasing, but when applying the correction I explained above there's a huge cycle reduction in there as well.

Of course there is like any ETF. Certain banks are allowed to redeem or put in baskets of predetermined size of bitcoins. So when the ETF is overvalued they redeem the coins and dump then on the exchange for zero risk arbitrage and when the  ETF in undervalued they buy BTC on an exchange and add it to the fund in exchange for shares in the ETF (which they can dump for a risk free arbitrage).
It's how GLD works.

Not quite the same as jaywalking as when a cop gives you a fine for jaywalking you have to pay. If you have a small amount of soft drugs in the Netherlands no judge will ever force you to pay any fine. The "looking the other way" is actually part of the law. 
Yes, the system is fucked up, but if we legalize soft drugs (which the vast majority wants) France will hurt us a lot in the European Union.

Growing the blocksize will centralize Bitcoin and make Bitcoin vulnerable to censorship.

@_date: 2017-02-14 15:09:47
It's not for free. It has cost, namely:

Your view of the world is extremely limited. Especially the wealthy need Bitcoin. Try moving $200M out of the US. I can assure you that is hard.

Anyway, Bitcoin only has value to high net worth individuals because the main value proposition is a level of security and censorship resistance not needed (or affordable!) by the masses. 
What big blockers are doing is taking away the possibility away from people that can afford it just so they can have yet another useless (insecure, censorable) payment network.

Asks me for data, proceeds to show someones opinion. Great.
I don't need calculations as any increase (even 1 bit) in block size will marginally increase centralization. It's simple logic.
Fees shouldn't double but go 100x. Then suddenly it's fees that won't matter. At 100x current fees, fees are still low for the kind of tx Bitcoin is perfect for. Large ones.

They are also not resistant to censorship. Try to move a couple hundred thousand pounds without this "fitting your expected spending" and see your account being frozen within 2 seconds.
Dont need those features? Cool, dont use Bitcoin, it's not for you. This is why the current block size is fine. Within a few years tx fees will be $100-$1000 I expect, which is very low compared to what you get for it.
Ps: I'm talking about on chain transactions

Making more tx per block will centralize Bitcoin. Just up the fees 2 orders of magnitude and we won't need a block reward. The fees will still be low for the size of tx for which the Bitcoin network is perfect: huge ones (because of the huge security).

The whole system only works because the blockchain is a limited resource. We don't need more than 7 txs per second as Bitcoin isn't meant for small transactions but for large ones.

So what do you think scaling means. Durrrr double the size lol durrrrr.
Maybe you can go study computer science. Come back when you're done ;)
@_date: 2016-01-27 10:47:58
Yes so let's distribute less than 21M coins in block rewards yay! NO that's breaking the social contract. The only thing that needs to be trusted in Bitcoin.
No-one decides the limit. We just leave it as is (if it were 2 MB right now I'd be advocating that). That's the only thing this works and Bitcoin doesn't get destroyed by lobbying like common politics around the world.
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:19:04
New around here? I was here many years before you. Look me up on bitcointalk or bitcoin otc if you must. 
You don't seem to understand common law. It's implicitly part of the social contract.

It's not a shortcoming. If you believe it's a shortcoming you should not be here.

Because it's won't be censorship free and it won't be secure?
It will be inherently valueless. Have fun moving $0 BTC across the blockchain for no fee! Very useful.
You are downplaying a huge market. An amazing one. A much better than than the transaction market for poor consumers. PLease just make another crypto for that and leave Bitcoin alone. This is unique.

No I realize you fail at logic.
Just people with a higher net worth are needed. And they come in gradually as Bitcoin proves itself.
A store of wealth such as Bitcoin does not need people that's can't afford a $100 transaction. They can use a higher layer :)

@_date: 2017-02-14 15:21:54
My ideal is whatever it is now. Don't change it. No central planning.
The core protocol should not change measured in number of transactions. It shouldn't because it can't without sacrificing security, distribution and censor-resistance. Build something on top of it or next to it.
Why is everyone so focused and impressed with the payment network? That really is no step up from anything that exists. The distribution, security and censorship resistance are the unique features here. Stop trying to kill those please.
@_date: 2017-02-08 14:21:00
This is bullshit. Just let the unlimited retards split off. Their chain will die. They are free to do this.

That's just market price? Most altcoins are extremely overvalued while Bitcoin is extremely overvalued. I mean the true current value of Bitcoin is 100-1000 times the current price and the true value of ETH must be at least 1000 times less than it is today.
So much opportunity to create wealth for yourself :)
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:42:18
Correct. I don't see the problem? Do you withdraw/deposit t/from your long term savings more often than that? :/
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:32:58
What is exactly so dangerous about doubling the money supply to 42M BTC?
Same question, same answer. It sets a dangerous precedent where the  value is diluted. I case of block size it's the value of blocks space, which dilutes the value of hashing power which decreases the level of security which makes Bitcoin less valuable.
On top of this it makes Bitcoin less decentralized because less people can run full nodes and therefore makes Bitcoin less censorship resistant again eroding it's value.
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:10:14
I'm against any increase. This would create a precedent (yes I realize it's a joke)
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:24:18
Exactly! Of course you can buy coffee on chain but the fee will be higher than the cost of the coffee. As it should be.

People that complain about "Censoring" have you seen  ?
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:07:57
Ok, by the same logic the block size is also way larger. Instead of 1 MB it's, 1024 kb, and wait here's more, there's 1048576 bytes and even 8388608 bits. Wow. Much amazed,. Such wonderful.
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:26:11
True. You can decide to be secure and not dependent on a third party or be non-secure and trust some third party. The latter is free and the former will cost a fee. Choose wisely :)

@_date: 2017-03-20 20:41:51
No, Erik has disappointed me too. He wants to increase the blocksize for fuck's sake. Of all (non core development) people I would think he'd be intelligent enough to understand that's as bad or worse than increasing the 21 M Bitcoin limit.
@_date: 2016-01-04 12:34:59
My point was that it is a plutocracy but it wasn't a criticism. 
My criticism was targeted at people with (near) zero wealth at stake here repeating their opinion and stating they are right because the majority wants it. The "majority" by number of people is of no importance. This is not a democracy.
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:43:28

These are extremely secure transactions, only meant for amounts that require that.

Vandalism is violence and that's what you are doing. Just make an altcoin and let Bitcoin be instead of fighting us. If you choose to fight you'll regret it.
@_date: 2016-01-27 11:06:38
There is a low coin supply: 21 M which will never be increased.
There is also a low block space supply: 1 MB which will never be increased.

@_date: 2017-03-30 12:20:55
You still don't understand. The miners (including their nodes!) will break off into their own little network away from the other nodes that don't accept the changes. They can do anything they want in their little network but it won't effect the full nodes running the existing rules as they will ignore the miner's full nodes for communicating invalid blocks (they will be banned).
I can code up a bunch of nodes with my own 'wachtwoord33' rules. I can even mine in that little network and have a whole blockchain going. Will anyone on the planet care? No! Same goes for the little network the miners would make except that the hash rate would be higher and they would scream very loud.

@_date: 2016-01-27 11:11:07
They are the exact same thing (maybe limited block size is even more important because it directly drives the level of security). You are just blind to see it!
If it emerges via consensus someone (namely a bunch of people) decide it. It emerges via the free market. Namely, if another crypto with a 16 MB block size emerges and takes over it will have emerged without anyone deciding it. If you butcher Bitcoin you ruin it for me. Just fork and start a 16MB Bitcoin with the same starting distribution of coins. Show me that it's superior! (lol)
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:09:26
Orphan risk is not important if you control &gt;50% of the hashing power. Because of the centralization you and your buddies are trying to impose in Bitcoin that is something that will happen. Bigger blocks are better for bigger institutions and will therefore lead to centralization.
@_date: 2016-01-29 12:56:50
yes people will become more secretive, but secrets are hard to keep. patents hinder innovation as you can't build upon the ideas of others. 
Go look at the ridiculous patents out there, very straightforward things no-one could have kept a secret if they wanted to sell their product (the shape of an iPhone for instance). Patents are what's slowing down human progress and I love the Chinese for ignoring the fuck out of them.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:50:21

@_date: 2017-03-30 09:38:43
Cool, then all those miners mining "illegal" blocks will have their own little blockchain for each other while the full nodes and the remaining uncorrupted miners continue Bitcoin at a lower hashrate. The malicious miners will soon switch back as their coins are only recognized by themselves and other malicious miners.

I read his bullshit. He says the following:
"If BU/EC gains the most hash power then the debate will rage on as the BU/EC will refuse to attack the minority chain out of moral reasons. What happens with bitcoin from that point I have no idea. If Core gains the majority share then the BU minority chain will be attacked by some of the majority miners. Core and their supporters do not have any moral objections against this kind of attack. "
He writes BU have morals and core has none. Right. What the actual fuck.

@_date: 2017-03-31 10:07:32
Running more SPV doesn't lower security. Running less full nodes does. Primarily however the lowering of security comes from the lower rewards will be offered to mining as you suggest inflating the blockspace, the thing miners are selling for providing their service. Less profit means lower security.

@_date: 2017-03-31 13:22:38
What's important here:
1) There's not way to prove what blocksize is optimal
2) So who will choose what to pick?
This will lead to central planning, political fights and compromises. The only fair way is to never change it from the current value similar to the amount of Bitcoin to be mined (as I'm sure at some point some Keynsian asshole will emerge who tries to argue that inflating Bitcoin further is for the good of everyone).
If you give in once for increasing the blocksize it will start to approach infinity pretty quickly.

Satoshi didnt do 1 hash 1 vote because he couldnt do I user one vote. 1 user 1 vote is democracy and it sucks. It's where the retards, the majority (yourself), decides. Economic power should decide and it will. Either with an economic war or without it the block limit will be preserved.
Ashame that we need to have a civil war (there is so much bigger evil to fight) but the fixed block size really cannot be  compromised on. It would undermine the entire system. So do the smart thing: lay down your arms and surrender. Otherwise this will get messy :(

No ad hominem, just tired that I need to keep repeating myself. Sorry if I came across too strong but I'm really getting annoyed (would I recognize your name from tof?)
No, just like there's nothing magical about the 21M limit, the 1 MB limit is also relatively free, but you can't change it. Changing it undermines the trust in the value of the commodity (in this case the block space). The miners are the dealers in blockspace and the supply needs to be fixed.
Yes we need the payment network I agree. But it's good enough by far for Bitcoin's purposes. The tx per second is easily high enough. Yes poor smuck's can't use it anymore in a few years. Why would that matter?

Of course, but in essence that also shows his Keynsian viewpoint. He only focuses on transactions per second, how is that different from the central banks printing new money and pumping it into the economy indiscriminately? Both think the velocity of money (moving of wealth) is the primary measurement of economic success. How deluded can you be?

No the market is not. XBT tokens will no longer be safe and protected once they change BTC into BU. I'm not talking about the exchange value on some exchange of course so of course the market is not damaging the property. Are you trolling me here or do you really not get it?
@_date: 2016-01-27 01:50:11
First thanks for the beer :)
Now let's continue with an actual rebuttal (forgive me for typos and badly structured sections as I am on my phone). I am convinced that any (also 1 byte) increase of the block size is in fact damaging to the value of Bitcoin. The reasons I'll state are the same as when someone would propose to increase the blocksize limit beyond the current ~21M limit. It's an expansion of 1 of the scarce resources that give Bitcoin value and therefore detrimental. Sure, increasing the limit to 21M+100BTC would have negligable effects but it would create a dangerous precedent and undermine the only trust that is needed in Bitcoin: trust that the social contract will be upheld. Note that on top of that 2 MB is not a small increase but a 100% increase!
Why is the blocksize limit such an important scarce resource in Bitcoin? Well because miners secure the network and their income consists solely out of transaction fees (the block subsidy is temporary and exponentially decreasing so we should ignore it when discussing the end game). So the security of the network is a direct function of the fees paid on average in a block. The transaction fees in a block are directly dependant on the block size as people pay tx fees to outbid each other to get their tx in a block. This has hardly ever been the case in Bitcoin's history thus far because all or most outstanding tx would fit in a block. Additionally there currently is a way to get free tx through coin age (I've used that many times) which will not exist in the future (it offers no value to miners to include these transactions for free).
In the end it comes down to this: The more scarce the block size for tx the higher the cummulative fees paid and this relation is exponential. Security is the main point in the value proposition of Bitcoin.
Next to the above there is the loss of centralization, both in mining (bigger blocks favor larger better connected operations even more) and in the decrease of full nodes.
Please dont forget that payment system is not an innovation and Bitcoins payment system is highly inefficient. Use another system (there are so many) for low value transactions that dont need the extreme security that Bitcoin can offer (if we dont butcher it).
If we really must change the block size from 1 MB then make it non-static and stick with the chosen function from now on. I've seen proposals (BIP 106 I think) or look at how Monero does it.
By all means don't try to be central planners. People suck at it (hence my  appeal to libertarianism).
Also dont let Bitcoin devolve into a democracy (with lobbying). If you want something changed make an altcoin. You can make the block size 1 TB for all I care :)

Easy, ETH is valued at 26.5% of the value of Bitcoin today while it is an inherently silly idea to use a Turing complete language for the scripting language in a blockchain based value token (which will be attacked again and again and again and again). On top of this there is no technical restriction to the number of tokens and most of the infrastructure is centralized.
And it's valued at 26.5% of XBT. It's quite easy to see that relative price is orders of magnitude of. It's unlikely for ETH to have much value.

Erik, how can the author of "a libertarian introduction" not see that the sacrifice of the limitation of supply of space on the blockchain will undermine the security of Bitcoin? How can he not see that any increase is a slippery slope that will result in increase after increase ad infinitum?

Stupid is a bit harsh, but if $5 is too much for you you don't need the security /and/or censorship resistance the Bitcoin network offers and you should use another way to store and transfer wealth.
For instance you can use the traditional banking or credit card system or a non-secure altcoin.

Really? Are you new here? I personally explained this already many many times.
Summarized: because it increases centralization, decreases security and decreases resistance to censorship. These are what gives Bitcoin value (not number of transactions per second).

Don't fuck with supply. That's central planning.
@_date: 2016-01-27 13:36:44
Well the 21 M coins add value because if it's unlimited the value of a coin will quickly approach 0.
Oh you meant the block size? Same argument. Go see the post you're responding to for detail but because the security function is directly dependent on fees and fees are directly dependent on block size.

Higher expressiveness means exponentially more exploitable. This is not what you want for store of value. I like the tech, but the tokens will not have high value.
In fact, I would love for Bitcoin to adopt Mimblewimble. This would make Bitcoin less expressive but it would be even less risky as it is today but you'd have features not possible with today's Bitcoin (for example strong privacy). I think this will have to be done on an altcoin as the support will be nowhere near required levels (see BU? You don't have to go force others if you have an idea with no absolute majority you can simply opt for an altcoin).
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:17:55
Because you're not letting the market figure it out ;). Anyway, libertarians adhere to the non-aggression principle ( *"Being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or* **possessions**.") and you're not doing it as you are destroying the current way Bitcoin works while it is obvious a large group of people who have a considerable economic interest in Bitcoin do not agree.
You can easily reach your objectives without harming what I call Bitcoin (and by "letting the market figure it out"). To do so you would create an altcoin called Bitcoin Unlimited (or whatever name), 
initialize the initial coin distribution using Peter R's spin-off structure ( and moving all your nodes and mining power to it. That way you create the coin you want, get rid of the core team "holding you back" and you don't hurt me and everyone like me who wants to stick with the current system. A hard fork is highly damaging and financially reckless (people have a lot of wealth in this system).
I feel personally threatened and attacked and morally (but likely not legally) supporters of Bitcoin Unlimited are committing a crime against me. You must be aware the above method is a possibility but still you insist on damaging or destroying what I own :(

Because that's central planning and we're not socialists or communists. We're libertarians here and believe in the free market.

It's the same thing. You're diluting the value of space on the blockchain. Say good bye to security. On top of this you want to double it and call it a small increase.

They could easily reach their objectives without harming the property of the current holders of XBT by creating an altcoin called Bitcoin Unlimited (or whatever name), initialize the initial coin distribution using Peter R's spin-off structure ( and moving all their nodes and mining power to it.

But the split is non-absolute. If some miners start mining something which not everyone agrees on by definition not all miners (as anyone can mine) will mine like that.

Doubling the coin supply was a joke to show how stupid it is to double the blocksize. 
You say that "Block size doesn't affect economics other than miner fees." Miner fees are everything my friend. 
And you think that miners are incentive to keep the size in check. Perhaps rationally but ever heard of the prisoner's dilemma? They will increase it to out-compete their competing miner's. 
USD doesn't have any intrinsic value so I'm not sure why you bring it up. If we would take gold, limiting the transactions would not be detrimental if it was accompanied by an extreme increase in security such as the Bitcoin system possesses as long as the blocksize is not increased.

More transactions but at a net lower price per block. If the block capacity is scarce the total fees collected will grow exponentially with demand.

It is. It will drive the price of tx fees (and coins) up and therefore security. Awesome. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:43:02
That's complete bullshit. Value is not defined by the number of users it's defined by utility. Bitcoin does not become more usually because a random poor person knows how to use it. It gets its value from the high level of security of balances and transfers, it's non-dependence on a any single point of failure due to distribution and its resistance to censorship. 
An important factor is the total sum of wealth put into the system sure. But people with no wealth are not going to be able to do that.
@_date: 2016-01-13 18:00:47

I'm not saying ancap guarantees freedom. I agree that it doesn't. But at least is doesn't guarantee the absence of freedom by it's very definition.
Btw you compare socialists to conservatives and I want to differentiate from both. Socialists mostly restrict your economic freedom while conservatives mostly restrict your social freedom (no abortian, euthanasia etc). On top of this, in the current political climate they both like to play big brother from 1984 so they are both scary as hell.
I do think socialists are more dangerous though because they restrict freedom in economics which long term trumps everything else.
BTW: I agree many rich people are indeed lucky (although over large enough numbers the wealthy deserve to be wealthy as life is not a casino but a skill game). Does that put justify forcibly taking away (part of) their wealth? I think not.

Who is all? It's an auction and there's room for 1 MB of transactions. If people value security they will bid the fees up and if they don't the fees will fall.

It's the exact same thing as the limit in units: 21M XBT, or 2100T individual units known as Satoshis (2.1 Quadrillion units). Would you be okay with upping that limit?

Yes, segWitt should preferably be redesigned to not increase capacity (possibly combined with a block size decrease but that is arbitrary so it's difficult).
I agree their different thing, but both limits are equally indispensible for giving value to Bitcoin. With unlimited block space fees will approach zero and with zero fees security will approach zero (as subsidy is phased out). With zero security the value of Bitcoin is zero. Every increase of the block size is a step on a slippery road towards that.  
Really people, this is not rocket science. I child should be able to comprehend this.

Asicboost is impossible with segwit tx in the block. So covert is blocked if we accept the premise that blocks without segwit transactions are likely asicboosted (which will be true some time in the future).

The number must logically be significantly lower. There's only 16M XBT out now, and significant holders must have at the very least have 1 XBT in my opinion. So the theoretical maximum is 16M holders. However there are many large holders. I expect that 3M is much closer the actual number.
@_date: 2017-01-20 16:08:34
It's the other way around. Remember fees are NOT fixed. 0 fee tx will already be included in the blocks. What do you think will happen after there is more block size. Yes disaster.

If you want to do central planning this is the best proposal I've seen. A smaller block size at this point in time would be highly beneficial to bootstrap the fee market to a significant level.
However, I'm blatantly against central planning as it combines the two things people are worst at planning (aka predicting the future) and being selfless (non-exploitative). Because of this reason the blocksize should stay fixed indefinitely.

They can still use asicboost if they exclude segwit transactions from their blocks right? That (if correct) needs to be stopped asap. 
Why don't we require the coinbase tx to be segwit from a certain block height? That would be a soft fork. Any argument against it?

As I understand it the witness part of the data has a less strong restriction on decentralization and therefore a discount is applied. With normal raw blocksize increase the block can be filled with more costly non-witness data. (I'm against any blocksize increase but segwit is much much better than just increasing the block size).
On top of that bitcoin wouldnt have had all the other improvements associated with the soft fork :)

Bitcoin has value because it's rare and useful. The usefulness lies in the transfer and store of wealth with extreme security (both against hacking and government coercion). So it's different than an Uzbeki typewriter (which doesn't have much usefulness these days other than a museum peace). 
Why would I be anti-side chains? It doesn't affect me so go right ahead. I don't want to impose on your liberties if you don't impose on mine. In Bitcoin we have agreed to a social contract I wish you wouldn't break. You can of course make another crypto or side-chain with a different social contract.

I'm against it because it increases the size of the block.
I'm not as strongly against it as to a normal block increase because it at least adds some value (it fixes a bug) but it could also easily have been implemented without increasing the blocksize beyond 1 MB.

1. An alt will not become the better and bigger coin if the block size stays the same. That's why I am directing you to an altcoin so you don't kill my goose :)
2. You don't really understand store of value do you? Things are valuable if the supply is limited. Therefore the supply of blockspace must stay limited for block space to have value. Block space it what the miners are selling (so higher price for block space means higher security).
3. I love all your alternative ideas where blockchain technology can be valuable. These are also high risk ideas however. Please try it out without risking Bitcoin. Use an altcoin or side-chain. That's why it's good people tried the (stupid!) idea of Ethereum outside of Bitcoin. Anonimity is also being tried outside of Bitcoin, both: with a good approach (XMR) and bad ones (Zerocoin and Dash).
4. Politics is not needed cause nothing needs to happen. Bitcoin is leagues ahead of anything else, the only thing we need to do is not fuck it up. We only play defense now. We've won! (unless we make huge blunders)

@_date: 2016-12-05 10:03:22
If a fork (the main fork) dies (because it's no longer a distributed system if you guys make the block size too high) this will severely undermine trust in the system.
Trust in the system (sometimes referred to as first mover advantage) is one of the main competitive advantages of Bitcoin. On top of that a fall of trust will hurt price and therefore hash rate and security. Showing a weakness like that will tempt a large governmental agency to take it down once and for all.
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:58:51
Exactly! The security is also higher than it has ever been and you're paying for that.
If you want lower security (and cheaper transactions) use another crypto. Bitcoin is for high value high security.

Dear lord. You're one of the useful idiots aren't you?

@_date: 2017-01-25 14:12:27
No we don't need to 'make Bitcoin work for all use cases'. That will break it. 
Bitcoin is good for the high value high security case. Another crypto will tackle the low value low security case. Both use cases don't go together (supporting the low value transactions cheaply would undermine the security of the high value ones which would be disastrous!) 
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:24:21
Yes I am wachtwoord from bitcointalk. 
You are surprised Bitcoin has any economic value? That really surprises me as it's the most simple economic concept of supply and demand. If block size stays at 1 MB I expect it to go up 3 orders magnitude more (2 at the very least).
You say you only think payments between countries of millions of dollars in value are useful. I agree that those are useful. You don't think a fee of $500 to move $5M is a good price for the security you're purchasing? For transactions of $1M today's purchasing power and up 1 MB is easily large enough.
If you kill Bitcoin you will simply lose me a lot of money without any gain. In fact it will be harder to get a new crypto big cause governments will be on their toes. If you like another type of crypto you should make an altcoin and overtake Bitcoin while it's still big (and a good lightning rod for your new crypto). Please include mimblewimble from the start if you do ;)
I don't think the simple increase of segwit will kill Bitcoin (10MB blocks definitely will!). I am against it though cause it will make Bitcoin a little bit less resilient than it is today. On top of that it might be used to explain an increase in the future by claiming it's a precedent. Finally, it's a form of central planning as it affects the fees in the system directly. No-one should have this power! (also not a democratic majority).
Segwit is not needed for adding layers btw. Off-chain transactions and lighting don't need it. I only like segwit for the mallibility fix but you don't need to increase the block size for that. Block size is only being increased because of politics.
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:34:01

People complaining are cheap skates or using Bitcoin for the wrong thing. The want to buy their coffee with it ....... ikr
@_date: 2016-11-21 10:17:13
Increasing the block-size undermines the financial feasibility of Bitcoin as fees will go down (fees will pay for security). It also lowers the distributed nature and therefore the resilience (to everything).
On top of it there is zero value. Bitcoin is a store of value with a level of security orders of magnitude above and beyond anything the world has ever seen. That is amazing and amazingly valuable. There is no need to try to also make into a network for small (daily) payments. Methods for that exist already (cash, credit, w/e) and if not a side-chain or altcoin will suffice.
Please don't kill our goose that lays golden eggs because you (people that like big blocks) want it to poop fully refined golden jewelry. You guys are playing with fire and are too stupid to know you are doing so. Bitcoin can change society for the better by so much but you rather risk that because you want to buy your coffee with it and are crying about paying a fee.

The truth
@_date: 2016-11-07 12:00:21
It's for storing and transferring of value with extreme security. Orders of magnitudes you are talking about don't deserve security of this magnitude (of course if you like paying fees of several hundred percent you are welcome to). Therefore it is not what it's for.
Please don't by coffee with Bitcoin. You're just making yourself look silly.
@_date: 2016-11-02 11:26:35
It makes it cheaper to use the transactions yes, but fees need to go up to keep the same level of security we have right now as the mining subsidy declines. That's way more important. 
If no-one uses segWith who really cares? I certainly don't.

No block size increase increases the security of Bitcoin and thus the value (as a secure system where no-one can meddle with is the most important feature of Bitcoin).
BTW the lower the velocity of money the higher the price as you need less people to hold it to sustain the price. This not important though. Intrinsic value IS.

If it's possible to reach the same result without the downsides you mention why don't you make a proposal for that? Solving the issue that people are not incentivised enough to run full nodes is a million times more important than there not being "enough" space on the blockchain.

Gavin hasn't been a developer for quite a while. He's been in the CIA's pocket since he visited then. I'm not saying he's evil, they could be threatening him or his family. I'm saying he's compromised.
How he dealt with that Aussie idiot claiming to be Satoshi I felt Gavin was screaming: "I'm compromised! Why don't you guys see it? I'm acting as retarded as I possibly can here .... "

Increasing the block size now or in the future ALWAYS means sacrificing some security and level of distribution. I doubt there will ever be a good reason for doing so. So yes, at this moment I would say I oppose a block size increase indefinitely.
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:55:04
All of them. The reasons in the article are the socio-economic reasons for not increasing the block size. The author knows what the reasons are but doesn't understand why they are so important :)

Being able to do only a limited set of actions is the reason Bitcoin is a safe store of value and Ethereum will not be (and hasn't been historically). The scammers and malware developers are handed all the tools they need.

Nah, BU will die, not Bitcoin. We just need to be vigilant and wipe out these people that try to destroy us rather than coexist peacefully.
Ethereum? You're serious about that trash? It will have infinite dilution and because the  script language is Turing complete the the DAO exploit will be the first of many such occurrences. On top of that it's centralized as fuck. It's at least 100 times overvalued and that's definitely not an exaggeration. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:00:02
They won't fork themselves of the longest chain as they declared "the longest chain" to be invalid and therefore not a chain at all. It would be miners that are forking to continue to mine on their invalid chain.

These reasons are obvious for all but the people it's hopeless to discuss them with. That's why they're not being discussed.

No we don't. I hope the size never gets increased again as that's central planning. Scaling will be achieved through layers on top of Bitcoin (LN is one such layer), if there is demand for scaling.
Bitcoin is NOT primarily a payment system. That is secondary to security, distribution and censorship resistance.

@_date: 2017-04-01 13:09:43
Yes. We should just alter SW to not increase the blocksize beyond 1 MB at all. The only reason SW was supposed to increase the blocksize at all was to throw the big block retards a bone but they only reacted violently so we should take it away from them.
SW with TOTAL blockspace 1 MB has my vote (I haven't updated Bitcoin core yet to avoid my node being listed as supporting SW in its current form).
@_date: 2017-04-30 16:17:08

Of course there is, people, rather than the market, will decide in a centralized manner, what is the most "optimal" block size at a specific time. 
The fact that they will require support from a supermajority of the users doesn't change that in the same sense the a representative democracy is also centralized (that's where most of the downsides come from).
Individual humans cannot determine very well what optimal economic conditions are (even though they like to pretend that they can, eg the fed and central banks). 
The block size is a similar constant to the supply of bitcoin (21million). It should never change and each and every change is detrimental (undermines trust in the immutability of the rules that govern bitcoin and dictate economic reality).
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:56:53

No. The segwit is ALREADY a damn compromise as it increases the available blocksize.
Let's take away that compromise as these big block assholes surely are not worth it. Let's activate SW WITH total blockspace at 1 MB (so including everything). That is the only decent proposal.
We need to escalate this shit and get rid of the cockroaches.
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:11:13
Doesnt that make a hash faster and therefore increase the effective hash rate of a chip as perceived by the network? I mean they will find 30% more blocks in the same time right? If so my initial conclusion is correct.

Ok everyone I am the author of the website. Now to answer your questions:
1) I registered a co.cc domain because I first want to see whether there is real interest before I start investing anything more than my free time
2) I assure you there is nothing dodgy about the site. I don't think i would even be able to perform any sort of exploit with this site running COMPLETELY inside Adobe Flash player
3) There were issues with the stability yesterday. These have been reported and I have resolved them today. Even so, all that crashed were Internet Browsers nothing more. People saying "their computer hasn't been the same" are mistaken since that is impossible. 
My post on the fixes:
I fixed the crash bug. I used a library which was causing memory referencing errors. So I have removed this library and rewrote everything it did from scratch (took me a while so this better be the cause of everyone’s crashes :))
To try the new version go to  and check if it says v0.3 in the header after “Cam 4 BTC!”. If it doesn’t, press control+f5 (to bypass the cash of your browser and cause an actual proper refresh).
Other fixes I did:
* I now show join and leaves from channels in the chat region
* I now show the number of viewers on the channel for the viewers as well
* The list of channels will not get out of sync anymore
Please test it and report if there are any more crashes, glitches or bugs. Of course I appreciate feedback as well.
A big thank you to everyone that has been so kind to try out the website :)

I hadn't seen this post. In the FAQ I have written: "Broadcasts of all sorts are allowed (including adult material) as long as it does not conflict with the laws in your location." 
Simply put, the fact that (in some jurisdictions) illegal content is shared using a file sharing program does not make the author of the file sharing program accountable, just the people sharing the content. The same applies here as no content of the video or audio is ever broadcasted to or via a server. They are broadcast only to other peers in the network.

Make a transaction to an address your heir controls with a locktime in the future (perhaps the 3 or 6 months you talk about, but a longer time seems safer), sign this transaction and make it available to your heir so he can broadcast it after the locktime.
If you're still alive if the timestamp is close to expiring make another transaction and move your Bitcoin to a new address and get it in a block. Thus making the transaction  your heir has invalid. 
Then make and sign a new transaction for moving your Bitcoin to an address your heir controls at some point in the future. Etc.

Software like Electrum that does NOT download the blockchain, validates the blocks and validates your Bitcoin holdings on its own but rather trusts a third party (e.g. the Electrum server operator) so give him correct information.

@_date: 2016-09-21 13:06:46
Seriously have you read the white paper even?
Bitcoin's security is paid for by transaction fees (the block subsidy get's halved roughly every 4 years). The only way for transaction fees to go up is for the block size to stay constant while the demand for transaction space goes up. If you increase the block size, while keeping demand for transactions constant, total fee per block (and therefore security!) will go down.
This is not rocket science people. This is all obvious as fuck for anyone willing to do even 1 minute of thinking.

Power consumption is a positive relative to all the alternatives (less than gold, banking system etc). On top of that global Bitcoin mining uses geographically stranded power (which would be wasted) and in doing so supports the execution of new renewable energy projects in remote locations.

I know the Chinese mining pools btc.com and viabtc have an accelerator service. In this you give them the txid of the transaction and pay them a fee denoted in USD and they'll include the tx regardless of the tx fee. I prefer not to link to their respective websites but Google is your friend :)

Interesting, however I'm afraid this erroneously counts a large portion of transactions which are internal book keeping transaction e.g. moving of bitcoin to a new address owned by the same person or entity. 
This effect is not constant across time. For example with the development if new wallets (both software and hardware) a peak of users moved their coins for security sake, not because of economic activity.
I wonder how much of the hypothesis of this study is undermined by this effect.

1) I looked for you and someone made a howto:  ( It's not suitable for a non-technical person I think though. Read the instructions but be very careful as making mistakes is easy (and costly!). it's important to learn to do this stuff yourself though (the alternative is trusting someone else).
2) By making the fee sufficiently large? Anyway, if it's too low your heir can always pay a miner directly to include it.
3) Well every time your transaction locktime is coming up you need to move the funds before that. Forget? Can't get your transaction in a block fast enough? Then your heirs can take what is yours before you intend them too.

Yes. The whole ecosystem does not value these attributes sufficiently for if they had, segwit would have been designed without an effective block size increase. I can live with segwit however as it brings clear benefits and changes the whole block size limit with a new system that is basically closed to future increases (except if you go hack around changing numbers for fun as the 2x and bch crowd like to see).

I'm aware that the Japanese market is generally valued quite low relative to North American and European markets. The reason for this is low growth in the last decades and low return of capital by Japanese firms.

@_date: 2017-05-05 15:30:06
Higher hash rate (and therefore security), higher distribution (and therefore censorship resistance), more active developers anmd therefore lower probability of bugs, less blockspace per timeframe (and therefore higher security).
The first three are direct consequences of networking effects of course.

No. Ether has no value.
* The scripting language is Turing complete and therefore inherently vulnerable (will be hacked to death)
* It's infinitely inflatable
* The ledger is not-immutable (Ether classic is immutable)
* It's centralized
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:38:37
Long term it does lead to a 0 valuation.
It has a non-zero price now because of speculation by:
* Uninformed people: understanding why this idea is bad needs an even higher technical knowledge than Bitcoin itself. Who of the investors have followed a fundamental informatics course in university to fully appreciate the implications of Turing completeness?
* Jealousy: like a lot of altcoins people think they are "too late" as Bitcoin is already "too big" and they want to "get in at the bottom". The pas has shown how big a mistake this has proven to be (People were saying this when Bitcoin was worth $5 already).
* More and more informed people coming in with a false sense of competence (especially people with an economical background). The most costly mistakes are made when you are absolutely sure you are right, yet wrong about that. I have yet to see. 
I truly would not buy Ether if it dropped to 1% of its current price. I have never seen something as overvalued in my life. It's priced at more than 50% of Bitcoin! LMFAO 
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:30:44
Yes but most users is not the correct way to "vote". Votes should be weighed economically. 
On top of that humans are terrible at planning for the future, always favoring short term comfort over the long term.
So the best solution is to simply make it immutable (like the 21 M Bitcoin limit) and live within those bounds. I understand it feels like artificially confining ourselves but the benefit (a long term workable market) is easily worth that price.
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:50:54
Yes, and that's the only reason.
Of all the options that have actual support from anyone but myself I do prefer this segWit proposal though as it's so much less detrimental than all the other crap offered and it offers some benefits. I just don't want to sacrifice security and level of distribution a higher number of transactions per block.
Do you support increasing the block size? (And by effect taking the role of central planner upon yourself)
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:56:02
My point is that politics is a cancer that grew far too large in the last century. At some point the giant tumor on all our backs will be so constraining enough people will be motivated to cut it off. This is a cycle which repeats itself throughout history (once "cut off" governments start growing again).

**Errol Keyner: I am the true inventor of Bitcoin**
The Australian computer scientist Craig Wright first announced that he was the creator of Bitcoin, but explained previously no evidence on the table. Who is the creator of the digital currency? Errol confesses Keyner.
Rumors went around for some time. The pressure became more and more for me to be frank. That moment is now. Admittedly, a bit cowardly it is to break my silence just as many already suspected.
Indeed, not Craig Steven Wright but I'm the real inventor of Bitcoin. Wright had no evidence for his allegations and turned an ordinary counterfeiter.
For those eccentric over the last few years has been living under a rock, my brainchild is electronic money that is not issued by governments or central banks. The conventional money system with dollars and euros is extremely complex and heavily manipulated by central banks.
Ordinary banks and speculators play only a supporting role in it. You like ordinary investor and consumer undergoes passive which cook up these dark forces.
Enjoy fame
Central banks in Europe, the US, UK and Japan do everything for years to get your money worth less be. Mario Draghi in his quest to inflation is a thief of your purchasing power and ability, you may not be surprised. An Italian remains an Italian.
But are extremely friendly and unassuming American colleague Janet Yellen is no better. Through devious tricks like they controlled accomplish what god Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe demonstrates the extreme.
She would not work with my full transparency and non manipulate Bitcoin. The safe and practical Bitcoin there is no reason to use euros.
I think I'll take the afternoon free to enjoy my fame. Quickly to the Chinese hairdresser and then to the supermarket. The Bitcoin / euro exchange rate is quite favorable at present.

If you can buy a secure transaction for $2000 we are already miles ahead of todays system. How would you suggest moving $50M from a US bank to a Russian bank? Securely and without censorship?
No paying $2000 will not do the trick.
You might think this does not affect you because you don't have $50M, but trust me when I say the effects of this limitation on others does affect you. Think about it.

What actually happened is politics came into the picture and found Keynesianism to be a great manipulation tool.
In short it all comes down to realizing that centralization is ineffective and vulnerable. Keynsianism centralizes the decision making (through central banks, government intervention, regulatory organizations) while austrian economics believes this to be a fools errand in the long run and realizes that allowing all the decentralized actors in the market to make their own decisions leads to vastly superior results.

Inflation means the inflation of supply as this is really inflated (more are produced). And this is the traditional (Austrian) economical definition.
Consumer prices are not inflated (there are not suddenly 'more consumer prices' or some crap like that) but rise or increase. 
The term 'inflation' is intentionally mis-applied to confuse, steer and manipulate (similarly how the term liberal and liberalism have been hijacked to mean the opposite of what they used to mean).
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:50:09
The technical capabilities have very little to do with why the blocksize should not be increased.
Miners get paid by selling block space (long term, for the time being they get a subsidy of 12.5 BTC right now but that's temporary). If you make more block space available the price of block space (fees per byte) will drop exponentially (it will approach 1 Satoshi per tx). 
The security of the network is very strongly positively correlated with the income of miners (if there is more profit in mining, people will invest in more hash rate and keep developing new technology). So increasing the block size decreases the security if Bitcoin. This is true with any increase but the higher the increase the worse the effect.

It's very clear you don't understand a thing about economics. This is about doubling supply. That it doesn't all get used is all the worse as it will drive fees to zero. Don't expand the supply of blockspace as you'll mess up the developing fee market.

There's other reasons why the gold market is controlled. Mostly because governments can control the flow because gold needs to be moved and stored physically and governments control the borders. This is far far less of a threat with Bitcoin.
The only way for something to be a proper store of wealth, supply needs to be limited or end state value is zero.

I agree. Why would you use Coinbase though?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:46:05
Transfer times that you find too long and mining fees that you find too high are irrelevant.
The main selling points are security (paid for by mining fees), censorship resistance, distribution (independence of central authority) and fixed supply (no inflation) and those are all in effect. 
People that thought this would replace credit cards or PayPal don't get this at all. This is much much more impactful than replacing the petty payment networks of this world. This is a universal store and transfer of wealth anywhere on the planet. For the first time you can truly own your own wealth.

@_date: 2017-06-07 10:24:30
So who gets to choose what it is? How will that decision be made?
By making the supply variable you add uncertainty to the economy and thus kill value for no gain. $10 does not take away the most economically valuable use cases, neither will $100 or even $1000.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:53:28

Thanks for taking the time to explain what you're saying. I'll need to take some time to look at this further but if the maximum number of moves is capped why did Vitalek advertise this as Turing complete? (cause it wouldn't be). False advertising.
I'm still not interested in ETH for the other reasons I mentioned (centralization, premine, unclear inflation scheme) but a perhaps something else can take Ethers place under these rules (if it chooses explicitly to not be Turing complete).

Everything is possible. Increasing the blocksize (by any amount) will decrease centralization and level of security though. That's elementary logic.

@_date: 2017-06-01 12:45:57
I made this point countless times before so I will stick to the conclusion: Less security, lower censorship resistance and lower distribution, the key selling points of Bitcoin.
Number of transactions per second is not a key selling point of Bitcoin. It would work fine with a far lower capacity than it has today. Want more? Have fun with bank transfers, paypal and credit cards.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:45:51
I wonder if you ever got it then.
My interest here, lies in the value of Bitcoin as a system for storing and transfering wealth without counter party risk. That wont work if you increase the block size due to centralization and reduced security.
And no not everyone will leave. Maybe a bunch of hippies with no money and no functioning brain, but those dont add anything of value anyway.
Money went into ETH because of jalousy of early adopters of Bitcoin and fomo. It will be the largest clusterfuck the world has ever (?) seen when the price mean reverts to the true value of ETH (which is really low).

@_date: 2017-06-17 16:24:34
I'm saying I would prefer segwit to not increase the block size at all (so have a maximum on the size of the block in addition to the weight function) but compared to all the other proposals that have been going around I find segwit exceptable but it is a compromise as the effective block size increases (and this should never EVER happen again).
Increasing the effective blocksize with segwit is already quite risky and I hope it will go okay. Anything higher is criminal negligence. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:34:25

Miners dont pay the full cost of storage (only a small fraction) so the incentives are not aligned well for this.  Not enough people will run a full node (to subsidize the miners) and the system will be centralized before long.
Last year and before security was exponentially lower than today. Also block reward is only for bootstrapping the system. Bitcoin needs to work well without it.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:08:28

The largest miner wants to make blocks large to centralize mining, kill the competition and run a monopoly. A block size increase is for then and not the users.
A secure store and transfer of value is for the users and that's not as good possible with a larger block size. There's already too much centralization for fuck's sake.

Refreshing dose of sanity :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:11:34
Yes indeed read the topic please. It even explains that 250 kb wasn't a real limit, but self-imposed by miners. The client would always accept blocks up to 1 MB (so such blocks were valid).
Separately from this 250 kb would have worked fine as a blocksize limit. But it never was the limit.
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:36:52
Great man! :)

Do you have any background in fundamental computer science? You should know the concequences of Turing completeness ...
On top of this the coin was launched as a scamcoin (premine, ICO, part of the block reward to the founders) and centralized control (who will be coerced into things).

That's not reasonable but incredibly stupid and displaying zero understanding of Bitcoin. I'm surprised you spelled the word correctly.

No blocksize increase. No compromise.

Segwit is an effective Bitcoin increase. Not a plain blocksize increase. 
Once we start increasing because LOL more tx!!!!111 (aska, Bitcoin classic, BU, JihanCoin, Barrycoin, etc) Bitcoin is lost.

With an unlimited cap, the value is of Bitcoin is absolute zero. It really is the most basic rule of economics. Scarcity and usefulness gives something value.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:57:32
The amount of people is not relevant, the economic value is. Beter have 100 people who invest $1M than 100000 people with $100 (for market cap purposes). 
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:06:55
Because the fee would be exponentially higher for the one versus the two.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:02:03
Like it or not this sets a precedent. Next time people will say: but we did it last time!
So an increase in block size is the most undesirable outcome. I would prefer no split though of course as that's inherently dangerous. However asicboost needs to be eliminated.
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:00:00
I highly doubt it. Fees will settle a bit higher, but as a consequence so will security and distribution.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:03:16
What if the ad hominem side is right? The side that doesn't follow the basic economic law of supply and demand? Well I suppose a random monkey can also be right through random chance.
Anyway, the point is that having an optimal block size is not even essential. It's essential for the economic rules to be constant and predictable. This means a stable blocksize and a stable maximum amount of Bitcoins and distribution method.
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:22:26
No they dont as their levels of security are exponentially lower plus most of them (especially Ethereum and Dash!) are incredibly centralized in effect creating implicit counter party risk.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:04:40
Security is a function of total fees, so how can you not understand increasing the block size lowers security? It's directly implied.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:20:29
The segwit2x code can't be good. Just look at their timeline.
HF "within 6 months" is most certainly NOT on core's timeline.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:40:27
Just run UASF which is compatible on August 1st and introduces segwit and then let them go fork themselves when they try to increase the block size. Have fun on their empty, value-less, network.

@_date: 2017-06-12 17:04:54
So it applies just when you like it?
It's a good thing also for the block size as this will make Bitcoin transactions exponentially more secure with time. This is needed for defending against strong actors who will with time be more incentivised to attack Bitcoin (and get increasingly powerful). 
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:37:23

Segwit already increases it effectively by discounting witness data.
I'm against any increase though as it's central planning and will set a dangerous precedent (creep).
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:54:03
So fucking up Bitcoin is an acceptable reason? So becoming more centralized is a valid reason? So becoming less secure is a valid reason? So become less resistant to censorship is a valid reason?
Seriously, do you know wat the word valid means?
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:54:08
Without the change you linked to Bitcoin always accepted 1 MB blocks. It's just that without this soft fork you wouldn't create blocks larger than 250 kb.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:21:46
No I didn't thanks for linking it, interesting read :)
I can see how it's likely beneficial. However:
1. First and foremost, who picks the discount? This is central planning! (I mean, 75% is nice, but what about 80%?). There are large economic consequences from this change and someone could be benefiting greatly! Just look at the current debate where Juhan was on one side (the BU side) of the debate merely because he would benefit economically. Yes people will lie and cheat and scam to gain advantages for themselves, it's called politics. There shouldn't be such incentives ...
2. The article says the witness data can be disregarded after verification. This is false as the other nodes will need it to verify this transaction. If everyone discards this information how can the transaction be verified by anyone else?
TLDR; for this time I can live with segwit I think (no HF blocksize increase though) but I really hope nothing like it ever happens in the future again. The bitcoin economic rule-set should be consistent and as immutable as possible.

Segwit does not have a max size but a weight function depending on the type of data you add to the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:52:41
Computer science is the science behind software engineering and the core members have proven their skill through conpetance and dont need a piece of paper to prove that (although I'm sure most do have that).
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:04:30
We agree as to not doing 2 things at the same time (like the stupid segwit plus 2MB proposal) as how would you know what caused the effect.
Also if you want to try out a block size increase realize a few things:
1. It will be forever
2. What increase is not harmful? 2 MB is double the current one. That's a gigantic increase.
3. How would you eve measure the effect? How full blocks are? That's easy to manipulate (plus if blocks are not full long term fees will approach zero)
4. What is even desirable? That's fifferent for all market participants who gets to chose? This is why things shouldn't change as you'll get lobbies (one of the main issues with democracy as well).
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:06:32
That's why I said "approach". It will not truly be zero. Way too low for a secure network though. The strength backing Bitcoin is that at any point in time the network is vastly overprotected relative to the current importance to the world. This implies the security needs to rise exponentially still. Attacking the network should not just be uneconomic, it should be so uneconomic even the crazy won't do it.

@_date: 2017-06-06 19:07:37
Block reward is temporary to bootstrap the system. Ignore it when talking about the fixed state of Bitcoin. Long term the miners will chase fees, make sure these are significant asap.
The system you are describing is a horrible centralized system with a few authorities. If you like that so much why are you reading about Bitcoin as it exists today and is known as the global banking systems.
It is not important how many people use Bitcoin. It's how much wealth the people that do use it want to store there.

So the limit was always 1 MB. The fact that miners chose to mine smaller blocks does not change that. That holds true even today. Miners can mine blocks of any size lower than 1 MB.

Segwit increases the block size does it not. Well like that.
It also goes a bit far calling segwit2x an agreement. I also have a "give wachtwoord 100000 BTC out of thin air"-agreement with me myself and I. Great agreement, much profit.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:28:15
Segwit wasn't supposed to increase the block size. They changed it so it did (to discount witness data). THAT was the compromise.

@_date: 2017-06-06 16:09:31
What is your background as you dont seem to follow a very basic implication?
Anyway, I'll try again. Miners are paid through fees. If miners are paid more consistently, security will be higher. If you increase blocksize fees will be consistently lower so the level of security will as well.
@_date: 2019-05-23 11:37:08
If anything it should be lowered to 300kb. However conservatism is likely more important.
The block size increase was the only drawback of segwit and it was completely unnecessary

It's probably worth nothing long term because it's Turing complete. On top of this it's fully centralized, has a pre-mine, infinite inflation and unclear inflation. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:31:28
They don't circumvent the limit so much as they create a separate specific use case solution which needs lower security.
I wouldnt want it in Bitcoin as a separate block as this would bloat thr blockchain. I'd be ok with changing the Bitcoin rules to match it once properly tested in an altcoin but you will never find support for removing the richness in the scripting language. For one thing people are actually using it! Imagine you locked your coins for 5 years and suddenly the script is not supported anymore. 
Sadly, we can never remove features. That's why we should be so careful with adding new ones.

@_date: 2017-06-12 17:10:35
No miners (Jihan) want big blocks to protect their little monopoly with their unfair advantage pricing all other miners out of the market and making them the de facto ruler. 
Less distributed? LMAO it would just be Jihan deciding everything. Censorship resistance would be gone as he would decide whose transactions pass and whose don't and the whole value proposition of Bitcoin would be destroyed.
If we increase the blocksize while taking out Jihan's unfair advantage he'd still take advantage of the larger block size because larger blocksize is in the advantage of larger players in the mining game. 
Short of a monopoly position increasing the block size is a net negative for miners and the fees they collect.
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:21:40
It did a roll back and is incredibly centralized due to an enormous blockchain. On top of that they want to phase out mining and go PoS. Total shitcoin.

Run code with segwit but not segwit2x. So either the uasf code or just core (who by that time will have segwit active and wont merge a blocksize increase) and you'll be fine.
Don't run segwit2x lol

Economics, supply and demand. You realize blockspace will only have value if it's limited and miners are paid by renting out blockspace right? 
If don't keep supply fixed the market will never trust it. It's like constantly changing the maximum coin supply from 21M to something else. Completely unworkable for a stable economy.

@_date: 2017-06-06 08:32:29
Unlimited supply will make the fees approach zero and therefore also take away security. 
Supply (of blocksize) needs to be limited at 1 MB to keep security and distribution (and therefore censorship resistance) high. For low value low risk transactions 3rd party networks will work great (e.g. lightning after segwit).

Lightning hubs don't centralize Bitcoin so that's easy. You can always issue a Bitcoin transaction (of course you'll have to pay) to avoid any centralization so there can be no effective censorship.
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:58:19
Yes it does as that's a direct consequence of a block size increase. Without the blocksize increase segwit2x is just segwit.

Thanks for the explanation. That indeed doesn't sound very good either. I'm not sure yet what my opinion is now.
At least you explained that Ethereum is not true Turing complete so I can stop relaying false information. Thanks again :)

Look at how Ethereum's money supply works. Premine, centralized decision on coin distribution and 1/8th of the block reward goes to ones who started the crypto. If it looks like a scamcoin and smells like one ...
The current valuation does not change that.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:52:14
It's more important that supply is fixed than that it's optimal.
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:13:02

@_date: 2017-06-19 08:31:14
The author states scarcity is not alone to give something value, which is true it also needs utility. 
However Bitcoin does have utility as it's the only currency and money system in the world which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. 
This is huge. Of course this requires you to run a full node so this should remain possible (so increasing the block size is a deadly sin).

So you use a trusted intermediary like in this example.

For Bitcoin it's more important everyone verifies all transactions to guarantee the integrity of the network (there's &gt;$42B of value stored here, don't fuck around with it).
Mimblewimble takes away complexity from Bitcoin. For instance the scripting language gets extremely simplified. This also enables strong anonymity btw! If someone create a Mimblewimble coin and has a fair launch (so not like zerocash) with no premine, no coin creator reward in mining etc. I'd be sure to buy some as it's one of the most intriguing developments in the crypto space imo :)

The same reason 21M Bitcoins is fine, but 21.1M is not. It's what we agreed on and what the market should be able to trust will not change. This has a huge influence on miner profitability (and therefore security and level of distribution)

ETH is just jealous people who are mad they missed out like most altcoins. People that actually know a thing or two about computer science won't invest in it even at 1% of the price it is today. It's almost certain to fail.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:53:00
They tested whether the existing nodes would be able to meet the harsher requirements of a 4 MB block size. That is not the right question to ask. Remember that there is no monetary incentive for running a full node.
I don't even see a mention of the effects on miner centralization through propagation time and all the cool attacks large miners can do on small ones that work much better with larger blocks.

@_date: 2013-12-24 16:40:40
I agree. I think the short confirmation time is an inherent disadvantage rather than an improvement. Litecoin should have sticked with the different hashing algorithm they copied of Novacoin (which sucked because it was premined).

@_date: 2017-06-16 19:01:37
Mining will get more centralized too because of propagation time. Large miners can do all sort of fun things to mess with their conpetitors too (if you find a new block other miners must validate it before they can mine on it). And indeed node decentralization will suffer greatly.
Basically it takes away security, distribution and censorship resistance: the whole value proposition of Bitcoin. Only if you want to kill Bitcoin or don't understand Bitcoin you'd want this.
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:02:35
It is. Perfectly fine.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:56:08
Ok, cause I really like that (Ethereum's currency aspect is particularly weak and vulnerable imo). Could you explain (or could you point me to a good resource to read) on how federated consensus differs from Ethereum's consensus method? 
You say it requires trust? If that is true that would be a great weakness. How does it require trust if it runs on Bitcoin?

You seem to agree with me but draw a totally different conclusion at the end. People want different things so no change should be made. The current system has use and works fine. Want something different? Start something new :)

That's a very simplistic way to look at it. You clearly don't grasp the interdepencies.
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:05:03
Because it compromises security (less incentive for miners with lower fees), makes Bitcoin less distributed and lowers censorship resistance.

One the first example has any value (yes the second and third have a value of zero). I suspect that some version of zerocoin will be implemented into Bitcoin at some point, but right now it has not been tested enough and requires too much space in the Blockchain. Both of these can definitely be resolved. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 07:04:28
Then don't use it? The price is high for using so much space in the most secure system in the world. You do realize for that money everyone running Bitcoin in the world will store a copy of your transaction?

I'd prefer also no segwit (so status quo) because segwit increases the block size.
However, if we're going to do anything, at least segwit has value, while a blocksize increase only does damage.

Most of it did or would have gone into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:04:12
A naked block size increase through hard fork will set a strong precedent to repeat it in the future ad infinitum. 
I'm hoping segwit will not do this (because it has a point other than increasing the blocksize), plus it enables another way to scale, removing pressure of people screaming to increase the block size.  I'm not 100% sure the effective blocksize increase of segwit was a smart move though (I would not have chosen for it ....)
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:11:09
But ETH and Dash pretty much are scams. They have no value if that's what you mean. Ripple is a scam of a different kind.
Litecoin is not a scam and neither is Monero or peercoin. Zerocash is a scam again however etc. It's not so difficult to detect these though for people that actually understand a little bit about crypto.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:36:20
