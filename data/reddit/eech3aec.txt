That's what the escrow is for. I suggest you use it.

Yep, new account and a bad photoshop job. Even if it wasn't, a tattoo isn't nearly sharp enough to be used as a QR code like that. Even if it was they tend to blur as time passes.

If you don't like it, raise an issue on GitHub. Users continuously mess up with private keys and get upset when they lose their funds. That's why they're hidden. 
**If you are "backing up" your private keys individually you're about to make a huge, very expensive mistake as well.**

Learn to identify devices too. The first picture is a flash drive, the most common chip packages that are long and thin with pins on the shorter sides are standard flash memory. Not something you'd find in a bitcoin miner, which usually use BGA or flip chip designs. 
It's also so clearly a scan just by looking, and without even reading their stupid TOS.

Transaction outputs are pruned, not blocks.

The fact is just that they're not a feasible thing to buy at this point. Even something like a RedFury (2.7GH/s @ 2.5W) is so expensive as to never make it's own cost back with the difficulty as high as it is. I know how you feel though, it would be nice for there to be devices that consumers could buy. The blackarrorsoftware X1 is probably as close as you're going to get (and they're legitimate, I have some of their older FPGA hardware). $400 USD for 100GH/s at the end of February. Wise? Who knows.

"Backup" a private key, make a transaction, boom, there's nothing in the private key and you have no "backup" of the change address. Just do things the way they're supposed to, or you'll lose money quick smart.

A Lancelot FPGA that's in a drawer somewhere. They've been around for quite a while now, and many many people had their hardware. 
There's lots of reviews and mentions of it on bitcointalk.org

Right. Or just use a deterministic wallet like Electrum and you don't need to worry about making backups ever again.

Yes.

Unskilled should not be messing with private keys. That's why there's no interface for it.

There's US resellers that will sell you one.

The supply is constant, that's what the difficulty regulates. It's more difficult now because too many coins were being generated before.
