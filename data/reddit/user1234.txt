I have literally never had a problem with a dishonest vendor or CC company; Didn't people lose a crap load of btc when this or that exchange or whatever closed down or turned out to be a scam?

This guy doesn't know what "unit of account" means.

No I admit that I skipped that part :) Though I'm amazed that there's not a cheaper way to do it.

These are great reasons to not use cash, which I why I almost always use a credit or debit card.  Why bitcoin and not USD?

I just use my credit card and the fee is like 2%. Net that against all the volatility and uncertainty in bitcoin, plus whatever markup in the price, I'm sure I come out ahead with good old credit.

Well sure but if I used cash or some other currency I'd be paying that extra 2-3% anyway, so the net drawback of using a card is +2% vs. anything else.

I don't know about your dollars but all the dollars I had in the bank before the crisis were (and still are!) worth about the same after the crisis.
And the funny thing is the thing is cyprus or kazakhstan problems are exactly what you get when you have a weak financial infrastructure, similar to, you know, bitcoin.

But I don't want to speculate with the currency I transact in; that's not what a currency is for.

If you're frequently transacting in Euro you should get a different card. Capital One, for example, charges no transaction fee whatsoever. Yay free market!
