Hello all. I am one of these newbies coming in. I have been watching bitcoin since it was announced and I now have saved up a little bit to finally take the step forward. Can someone genuine and patient pm me how to get started, I've been very confused and honestly cannot tell safe from unsafe right now and just need a little help. What I know is I will need to make a bitcoin wallet but there is so much out there that I can't tell anymore what's right. I'd prefer a pm due to slight embarrassment of not really knowing as much as I should. Thank you in advance.

You know what, I got a few pm's that at first didn't seem suspicious, but after a couple back and forth pm's it just felt odd and I couldn't explain it till now. Thank you for the perspective shift I needed. I will also say I got some very kind and what I believe to be genuine advice from some users here so thank you all for the replys. I ended up getting circle, and a scary thing happened. I installed bitcoin wallet from play store and when I opened it, it some how remembered my username and password from 2014 and I have $ 0.21 of usd worth of bit coin. Now here's the weird part. I had to search my email and I found about two dozen companies that sent to my wallet .00001btc for no apparent reason. I never asked for it, and I surely had no idea that I even had an account active till now, but I think I really need someone to talk to about my situation. I'm confused as to why they sent me free tiny amounts of Bitcoin. Some one please advise.

Also, I was meaning to ask, if it's OK to share screen shots of my Emails, or would that put me at risk because of the TX details.

Thank you. When I get in the office today, I will get the email details to you guys as far as sender, TX unique info and whatever else is pertinent. I use original Bitcoin Wallet version 4.58 wich I originally installed about 3 years ago. I use gmail, which is how I was getting payment notices of payment increments of as little as 0.00001 sometimes and often times more. It sounds weird as it is weird. I'm convinced something is not right. I won't let it get me down though, just wanted to contribute by sharing, maybe it will be bringing a scam to light so others can spot fishy business
