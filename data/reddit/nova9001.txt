Why compare with Venezuela currency when you whole argument was with USD?
All those wealthy people diversify their wealth, they have stakes in multiple industries and currencies. But they still need to have a healthy amount of USD considering every major transaction involves US dollars. Nobody is going to accept your gold or silver or stocks when you want to buy something. Its all in USD, get over it already.
The most useful currency in Venezuela now is USD. BTC has its benefits but you need electricity to use it, if the electricity is down, nobody can use it. Its normally used for people outside of Venezuela trying to wire money in. USD in always the currency in any country where their own fiat is worthless.

Anyone who bought above the current price point made a loss. OP is claiming btc is a great way to store wealth. Not too great for all those losers so far. In fact given the pump and dump nature of cryto, I would say most of those who "invested" are losers. Few winners.
I enjoy watching it crashing down though on the sidelines.

Best answer anyone can give imo.
Normally the legit main exchanges will need to verify your bank information. You need valid bank account to use them, as long as you don't do anything shady you won't have any problems with it.
@_date: 2019-03-20 10:31:03
Yes that would be what is happening, but shills here are spinning that people will be using btc when electricity is down. The title is extremely clickbait.
@_date: 2019-03-06 10:32:52
Basically another case of business "accepting" bitcoin but really only accepting fiat. You still have to pay for the transaction fees and exchange fees. The business don't really mind the btc as long as they get dollars in the end.
@_date: 2019-03-08 00:42:29
Don't worry these btc shills will use anything to get more people to buy in. Looking at the hard work they are putting in, the price might actually go up.
@_date: 2019-03-05 22:54:16
Already hoarded by rich people before it even hits the market. It functions just like stocks. Before the stock goes public, its owned by banks, financial institutions and etc. When the stock goes public, they start releasing maybe 10% of the stock to public which means the price will most likely go up because supply is so tight.
Same shit with crypto, most of it is held by the developers and their financiers. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 10:03:17
No marketing budget? All this shills shitposting everyday pumping btc are doing it for free?
@_date: 2019-03-21 05:16:19
Just like all the other shillcoins are promising. Basically your chances of choosing the right one are rare as fked. Might as well not try.
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:50:42
I guess this makes sense. I was refering to in Venezuala itself. USD cash would be the most convenient currency. And like you said, if they had ran out of batteries, how would they be able to accept the currency?
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:40:24
Yea another post by shills to pump btc again. Like anyone with brain cells know they would be using USD in cash to deal with most their transactions. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 10:41:26
What's the point of projecting prices? There's 2 results, up or down. You can't argue based on facts we have now and we have to into projection?
@_date: 2019-03-27 09:22:16
The market cap is bs because most of BTC are owned by the same people. Its just like a penny stock where the value is grossly inflated.
Trade volume means nothing, most of the trade volume comes from unregulated sites who report false data. 
But this is better than your everyday shill posts.
@_date: 2019-03-18 06:52:55
Isit the pump or the dump?
Pray you are on the correct cycle.
@_date: 2019-03-15 02:05:05
Still the same issue, why would anyone trust BTC rather than the existing financial system. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 10:16:50
Waiting for a credible reason why we need to use btc other than shills making posts.
@_date: 2019-03-29 06:48:13
Yes buy btc because it has deflated faster than anything remotely trustworthy. If you bought at 20k because of this reason, you have already lost 16 to 17k btc at todays prices.
How does this even protect your dollar value? 
@_date: 2019-03-01 09:39:56
Not dumb just shills pumping btc. You see multiple posts like this everyday. They somehow expects people to drop their savings and go big on btc so they can cash out.
@_date: 2019-03-01 00:39:22
Its the same as putting their reserves in penny stocks then.
@_date: 2019-03-05 07:30:23
This discussion will also involve how they accept bitcoin but will want it converted to dollars before they actually accept it. Factor in transaction fees and exchange rates, it would make Visa cheaper. So they will just keep Visa.
@_date: 2019-03-06 00:39:32
That's how bitcoin works. Someone already hoarded it for years and what you see now is just pump and dump. Everyone treats it like the commodity it is.
Nobody is buying bitcoin because its the future, they are buying it to cash out later.
@_date: 2019-03-29 10:15:45
This is the biggest load of bs lol. Claiming you know where billionaires keep their wealth is ridiculous enough, but claiming none of them keep their wealth in USD. I get you want to shill btc but this is another level of bs.
@_date: 2019-03-01 01:05:06
Yea if I am not a shill then I am stupid or ignorant. BTC will go up to 100k, infinity and beyond as predicted by some nobody shill.
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:17:08
Massive bitcoin boom coming and he's only spending 10k a week on btc. Really massive boom there.

One day when someone can actually come out with real reasons other than shills shit posting all day.
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:25:07
Some of these tweets are so dumb I wonder who they are targeting at.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:52:41
I am not sure if Switzerland people pay taxes but we definitely pay taxes in Singapore. The tax rate in Singapore was extremely low like 3% for me based on my income. Some reasons are due to its high efficiency and low corruption. Water and electricity are public services provided by the government.
So I am not sure what you are trying to imply.
@_date: 2019-02-18 02:11:44
All this misleading crap is why no one takes btc seriously. If US dollars become worthless, where is the value of btc? It doesn't take a genius to figure out it will be worthless too.
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:24:54
Yeap, don't worry btc will be a global currency and is superior to every fiat currency out there .
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:56:13
People believe what they want even if its from an obvious shill. By this logic we should just buy up every shit cryptocoin because they are going to the moon.
@_date: 2019-02-21 01:53:19
I am not even sure how to answer this. Maybe you can try to read on why national parks were created in the first place. Sometimes coming to this subreddit makes me sad. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 08:33:14
Do you use fundamentals when you talk about penny stocks? No because its manipulated like hell and it goes up or down depending on those controlling the penny stocks.
For btc its the same, pump and dump. If you want to gamble and feel that its going to get pumped up soon sure, go in but don't expect that it will go up due to "fundamentals".
For something like BTC, people are going to run for the door at the first sign of trouble so expect double digit drops. Of course if the pump is ongoing you can expect double digit gains. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:46:00
Logic doesn't work here just shills pushing BTC because they bought too high and now they need a way out.
@_date: 2019-02-21 08:55:36
Its a very simple relationship between land area and population. It is just much cheaper to build infrastructure in a small area with a high population. It doesn't work in a country with the size of the US, unless you just ignore everyone who isn't in the city. 
Lastly you do have a choice to move somewhere else if you don't agree with the tax rate although I agree the idea of paying so much taxes might rub people wrong. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 08:56:37
Transaction volume is pretty meaningless. The top transacted stock is always penny stocks that will be used for pump and dumps. So by this logic penny stocks are better than blue chips?
Given that btc is not even mainstream yet most of these transactions are just between the same accounts used to generate fake volume.
@_date: 2019-02-21 03:32:30
Short the banks when banks are held responsible for criminal conduct which is why laws exist in the first place? So now money launderers can just do it via btc without oversight and that is good for everyone?
Fking logic right there.
@_date: 2019-02-18 03:17:53
Everything is pegged to USD. If there was such an event that renders USD worthless, it would be a global financial crisis which would probably mean the end of our current economy. Most people don't understand that you need a global currency to trade, and without a global currency, you can't put a value on commodities simply because everyone would refuse to trade with anyone.
What this shrill is trying to say is if world economy collapse, btc will be the next big thing which is ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-02-21 08:37:01
Not every country can be Singapore and Switzerland. Both also happen to be small countries that function as their regional financial headquarters. Singapore has 7m population living in an area smaller than your normal sized city. When you look at bigger countries suddenly the cost of infrastructure goes up massively. This is the reason why it cost more taxes to pay for all those power lines, plumbing and roads.
If anyone here thinks they can skip paying taxes regardless of whatever excuse you have, good luck to you.
@_date: 2019-02-07 08:14:49
All these claims on how BTC is the future is just delusional. There is no advantage over fiat other then claiming they don't want banks to control their money, they want it to be "decentralized", they want it to be free of manipulation.
The fact that everyone buys BTC to make more fiat money is just such an irony. If fiat is worthless what value does BTC even has. 
And they seriously believe that BTC is free of manipulation. Looking at its price history would tell you its highly manipulated.
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:48:12
Yeap, they actually that if the global economy collapses btc will be the new global currency. Its like saying whoever rebuilds the economy would choose btc instead of their own currency. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 03:35:28
Yea I get the point that people hoarding the bulk of btc want it to be the global currency. But I don't think the rest of us appreciate the global currency to fluctuate like a penny stock. It also doesn't help that most of the BTC is held by a small % of users just like wealth so what do the rest of us gain going into BTC? 
@_date: 2019-02-20 09:56:58
Straight up what some edgy teen thinks about the tax system. If nobody paid taxes we would not have all the public services available. Take some time to appreciate those, you can go to countries that don't have public services and see what its like trying to survive without basic stuff like water, electricity.
@_date: 2019-02-19 00:46:26
I would say only in illegal deals regardless small or large scale. There's no way any legitimate business can keep any amount of btc because the value fluctuates wildly everyday. Most business so far that accepts btc doesn't really accept btc, they accept your btc once you convert it to dollars and you bear the transaction and exchange rate. This so you can balance your accounting at the end of the day and get your auditing done to pay taxes.
@_date: 2019-02-12 01:52:44
Why do we need to transact privately online? If every transaction is private, how do you actually pay taxes? No audit, no way of verifying anything, just private records?
@_date: 2019-02-18 06:56:29
Actually I am a non-US business that deals internationally in US dollars. I have never meet any international business that would seriously consider btc as a global currency. And we are dealing mainly with chinese manufacturers. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:54:07
Not everything can be privatized. Some business are loss making and if privatized would significantly cost more to consumers. Like national parks, if it were privatized, they would have just sold the land/resources for money.
@_date: 2019-02-11 06:39:05
Lmao, 36k views. Clearly this is the start of mainstream adoption.

@_date: 2019-02-18 09:15:52
Given the amount of manipulation, there is no limit to how high it can get if those who control the bulk of it decide to pump. The problem is they can just as likely dump and as usual in any kind of dump, most people can't afford to hold.
The other cryptos are just shadowing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 06:58:37
What transition? Other than jokers posting btc meme I still have yet to see something concrete.
Please share the signs of transition.
@_date: 2019-02-11 08:35:51
Until legitimate business actually accept it as a currency and you see goods being sold in btc instead of dollars.
Right now there are people going around claiming that btc is legitimate because business are accepting btc. The truth is they aren't, they are allowing you to pay in btc but they accept dollars. This means the cost of transaction/exchange from btc is on you and the business still gets dollars at the end. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 06:57:59
Whatever that global currency is, it should not be fluctuating like btc. Today I owe 100k in btc, but tomorrow might be 120k in btc. So I will never pay my bills until it goes back to 100k in btc and everyone else will do the same. 
Also not withstanding how heavily manipulated btc is, that's why no serious business would consider switching.
@_date: 2019-02-28 10:18:13
They just churn out opinions like these with no basis whatsoever wondering why btc is not mainstream yet. There should be an actual cryto subreddit where people discuss things rationally not just shilling rubbish like this.
@_date: 2019-02-12 04:50:07
Yea, so no real reason why except that the government is evil.
@_date: 2019-02-18 08:29:50
Yea, all it takes is some twitter meme to make btc mainstream and all their supporters to be economic experts. Still nothing solid coming from btc supporters. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 08:36:35
Right, I am not an economic expert and clueless. Fine arguments on the internet but not convincing sadly. If you are such an expert, please explain to me why, I am open minded and ready to learn. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 06:31:06

@_date: 2019-01-24 04:33:20
How does going Btc help? Every major BTC exchange has to verify your information through your credit card which means if you don't have a bank account you can't use their services.
If you go to small or shady exchanges you are likely going to lose your Btc too.
@_date: 2019-01-16 01:04:42
Ok, no financial reasoning whatsoever but as long as it makes you happy.
Of course bitcoin is used for all sorts of shady stuff like drug deals, illegal purchasing of weapons, hit contracts and etc on the dark web but its ok because you are not the one doing it. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 09:26:56
Hey man relax, BTC will be the next big thing ok?
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:19:21
In some way, shape or form. Means nothing much really.
Only one state gov is accepting btc for taxes, thats Ohio. And they are not really accepting btc, merely converting it to dollars before accepting it. Basically they don't care how you pay as long as you are paying it in dollars. Also converting from btc to dollars would mean you lose more because of the exchange rate compared to business who would be paying in dollars in the first place.
This is pretty bad example, I am wondering which legitimate business would even consider using btc to pay taxes. 
But sure, its real and they are taking it "seriously". 
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:03:05
I will trust these jokers because they bought into btc.
@_date: 2019-01-02 09:05:59
Daily volume means nothing. You can create as much daily volume as you like, given how the cryto exchanges work with 0 transparency. The important thing is market cap, if 2.1m can move the market by 5% the market cap is a joke. 
Have fun being manipulated to the moon. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:30:56
This is probably why his bank account is frozen and why Kraken can't transfer funds to him. Basically he is dodgy as fuck, this kind of excuse doesn't fly with the authorities.

On paper sure, in practice nope. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:25:47
Bloody nonsense, if you are selling USD you can diversify your portfolio into gold, oil, minerals and whatever. If you are buying into BTC, how dose it protect you from inflation, economic uncertainty and corruption? BTC is manipulated like fuck it makes penny stocks look tame.

If you are moving such huge sums and you don't have anything to back them, you are an idiot. This guy is saying he does investments and because of "investments" he moves huge volumes of money. Overall just dumb shit that causes his account to get frozen and he blames the exchange.
@_date: 2019-01-24 01:30:43
Lmao, so btc will be stored in banks and some people claim btc will replace our entire financial system. Its just another commodity and the financial system is still based on banks.
@_date: 2019-01-18 06:31:36
I don't mind if we have a real solution to fiat currency but some people are just pumping smoke claiming btc is the solution. Its manipulated like fuck and every other alt coin that claims to be better than btc literally shadows its price movements.

The start of another pump and dump cycle. Better pray the pump goes stronger this time. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 07:58:59
I am not against market manipulation or gambling by those who want to participate in it.
I am against people who claim nonsense out of btc and crytos. With these bs going on, no real institution will take crytos seriously. Also most of these idiots claiming shit on btcs have already invested in it and hope some other idiots come along to boost the price so they can take money out.
@_date: 2019-01-24 09:23:22
How does that work? Who will give who first? Definitely an exchange is needed unless you can work that out. Somehow nobody has been able to so far.
@_date: 2019-01-16 00:35:02
How do you know nobody can create more of it? You are not the creator, nobody knows anything about who created BTC and how many BTCs are the creators actually holding.
Even if there is a finite amount like you claim, there's no stopping anyone from manipulating the shit out of it just like its being manipulated now. If you bought at 10k and its now 3 to 4k you have already lost more than half your investment in less than a month.
Don't forget that the only way for you to make money out of BTC is if people continuously pump money into it. If everyone is buying BTC with the hopes of making more paper money, how can this be sustained? Unless you find more idiots to join this pump and dump sure.
@_date: 2019-01-02 08:05:49
Easier to manipulate than a penny stock and people are claiming this is the next big thing.
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:20:19
The first to go down during a crisis would be things that have no foundations. If every alt coin is dependent on btc prices, you can guess what happens to cryto as a whole when crisis hits.
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:18:59
I don't have a moral ground on whatever medium I use, but you claim to have one, so how does this makes it different for you? 
Doesn't that makes it pointless to use BTC if its also used to fund all these bad stuff? 
Difficult to argue with BTC cultist though, enjoy your coins one day they will go up to the moon.
@_date: 2019-01-16 00:38:04
Don't forget the fact that the only reason people are buying BTC is to get more paper money regardless of what they claim.
So who is going to put cash into BTC to pump the value up? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 07:22:59
Yes, no real business would accept bitcoins but these btc nuts are claiming they are being accepted to add legitimacy to these shill coins.
Any business that accepts btc would require you to exchange your btc to dollars before accepting it. It means you bear the exchange cost and transaction fees. 
There is a very big difference between actually accepting btc or allowing you to convert your btc to dollars and accepting dollars. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 08:44:02
Yea just like how every penny stock is going to be the next big thing because money is going to flow into them. 
But honestly it doesn't if it gets big or not, most people will still get ripped off while only a small minority makes money. Due to the limitations of btc it will never replace cash money.
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:13:54
Lousy comparison. Nobody buys bitcoins because they want to use it. The only reason anyone buys bitcoins or any other crytocurrency is to make more paper money. In this case no matter which paper money you are using, they are all backed by US currencies which means everyone is actually trying to get more US dollars.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:59:44
Just like penny stocks in the stock market.
