Right. I was only counting the ones from after October 2008.

Clearly, because you don't have an argument.  I encourage you to try and debate at least one point I have made.  PLEASE enlighten me on how the lightning network is the most clever mousetrap to scale Bitcoin.  You can't and its pathetic.

I'm a capitalist evangelist actually.  I have a problem with Blockstream throwing a bigass wrench into the whole free market behind Bitcoin.

Gavin had a very well laid out proposal based on where Bitcoin SHOULD be growing.
@_date: 2016-02-05 10:13:13
1. FUD spread from core devs on why 1mb block hasn't been increased despite blatant and urgent need based on transaction growth on the network increasing rapidly. 
2. RBF (which is a disaster) and the obsession over fees to weed out "legitimite" transactions in the eyes of the enlightened. 
3. Blockstream influence in development
I stated the lightning network is it's own protocol which is still just a wild idea.  Waiting for your point still.

Sounds legit.

Straw man's argument.  Did you read my statement? A venture backed startup is involved in steering the core design behind bitcoin for one that is centralized and monetized in order to turn a PROFIT for the investors they serve.  Read my post again and maybe you would understand a bit more about Bitcoin considering you are an obvious Johnny come lately shill.  You're a fucking IDIOT on the subject so maybe you should start by going back and reading the original white paper.  You have no concept of the economics which function inside of the bitcoin system.

Your move, Mr. Dimon.

I don't like her tire analogy, Satoshi invented a flying car.
Otherwise I enjoyed the interview and felt like she had some profound insights.

Wow coindesk way to blatantly get your facts wrong..Balaji is NOT 21 inc's CEO he is a chairman and co-founder. Matt Pauker is the CEO..

You continue to listen to your own narrative.  The point is private blockchains require $$$$.  The innovation with Bitcoin is the currency giving incentive and allows for miners to voluntarily contribute resources.  This makes it cheaper for someone to record an entry onto the blockchain than trying to set up a system themselves.  There would have to be tremendous profit for someone to be willing to set up a private blockchain.

Thanks for making my point, they require internal computing resources vs Bitcoin which self scales due to mining.  Costly to maintain a private blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-11-22 03:32:31
Far more secure because of decentralized nature.  Private blockchain would be fairly centralized.  Nowhere near as distributed as Bitcoin network.  In addition you would be relying on a single entity to maintain the blockchain, or maybe it is a bunch of companies that partner to do so.  Someone is managing this which will add significant cost. How do I know these companies will be around in the future, these are a lot of assumptions. Bitcoin has a six year track record so far so the advantage is Bitcoin at this point.  Let's get a private blockchain up and running first - even Nasdaq admitted they weren't sure how their private blockchain experiment was going to turn out.

5 cent transaction fee is still cheaper than your old hp laptops and far more secure.  Not many people would trust an asset transfer on your 3 hp laptops and it still costs you power, time and effort to maintain.  After a year you'd give up on your blockchain experiment with your old laptops, if it was successful I'm guessing you would have to invest in new hardware.  I think most people will pay the 5 cent transaction fee and have their immutable stamp.

That's what I'm arguing, the fact that a distributed model is cheaper for the end user as opposed to a private chain. (Now the one X factor is definitely feature set)  It would take a fair amount of resources and effort, if they need to scale the settlement of millions of trades a day for example (which is exactly what Blythe masters wants to do) this would require an ever increasing amount of hardware resources.  I believe the Bitcoin currency will allow its blockchain to displace any competitor in the long run.  It may be overall less efficient but not for the end user, the only ones taking risk are the miners and the holders of Bitcoin who's value can go down over a period of time due to Heavy selling pressure from miners. The miners and holders of the currency are voluntarily taking on the risk vs one entity running and paying for the entire system.

You are absolutely right about the waste.  I guess what I meant with the Facebook / Google example is that these data centers are extremely well thought out, designed and implemented - which also includes environmental measures.  But this in itself costs an enormous amount of money and can only financed by a company with the revenue to justify the expense.  So from an economic standpoint, this is the breakthrough in Bitcoin, there is no company with a team of data center managers and engineers to plan out how they will scale.  There is no company purchasing servers with their cash flow.  It all happens voluntarily by the miners willing to contribute their compute resources in exchange for the Bitcoin currency which is truly amazing when you think about.

Definitely valid concerns and criticisms with the system.  Although because mining is a free market system, we are just witnessing capital being allocated in order to compete.  This is just further reinforcing the economics behind the currency and making it more sought after and valuable.  It's also a double edged sword because the miners mainly doing so to make a profit, the fact that Bitcoin does have real world value makes it possible.  Its all very interesting, I've been into Bitcoin for almost 5 years and it still fascinates me everyday!

Similar demographic here and I have had similar experiences.  Some of my smartest, most educated and investing minded / ambitious friends will listen but have a very complacent reaction to everything I tell them.  I get the sense that there isn't too much urgency even at the possibility of becoming potentially very wealthy.  Kind of a weird phenomenon.
