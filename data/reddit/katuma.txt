Most likely scenario:
    Your thumb drive got mirrored somewhere along the way.
Less likely but plausible:
    Backdoored PKGBUILD

Either it's a hostile takeover, or last resort measure. Impossible to tell at this moment.

Suggestion if the message ought to be neutral - include reference to list of payment processors the same way you do for wallets, and not just bitpay - to get rid of the unintended impression this is their flyer.

POC already implemented. But CC/bitcoinx people would prefer to stay in bitcoin blockchain, at least for now. It's the best option from engineering perspective to implement atomic OTC p2p Asset/BTC trades.
Op, If you're feeling serious about this, we'd love to hear from you at 
Original spec - 
The protocol is jointly designed for a while now. There is also 10BTC bounty whomever writes *proper* specification (RFC style), because currently, the protocol is what just single implementation assumes it is.

[Can we please cue the whoring trend of posting github links just for the sake of another README.MD vaporware? Ideas are dime a dozen, actual viable technical spec/implementation, not so much.](

Yup. Except then you dont need bitcoin at all, because universal turing machine p2p auction is useless as a PoW scheme.

Really like what i'm seeing here (in comparison to overengineered buttercoin vaporware).
While hard numbers are important, people are shallow, thus interested in fancy UIs too.
Yes, I'm implying slap kqueue websocketesque network i/o on top of this (with fast ECC/HMAC auth instead of that SSL bullshit, say  ) + Fancy JS UI.
Btw, what about book/balance sheet snapshots + journal to assure robustness?
@_date: 2013-05-03 22:45:32
Possible, but somehow I doubt it.
Mind explaining on how to do that wrt:
Let's assume Texas Instruments dont put universal hardwire backdoors in their chips :)
(other components are in no position to compromise security - cmos, lcd etc).
Btw, Trezor never claimed absolute security, but only reasonable (and certainly far above PC/Android wallet) for the price.

You're advertising yourself too aggressively - for example it's not "p2p exchange", but p2p with centralized arbiter - by the way, mtgox allows people to trade between themselves and the exchange is just benevolent overlooker. Surprise, surprise they can mutually destruct on their whim as well.
You're overly convinced MAD is ideal state market, in fact its the opposite - it's the lowest state in game theory when everyone is evil, ie upper bound on how hard it is to play.
tl;dr: I want to exchange 1BTC for LTC, but need to put out another 1BTC collateral to do that - sounds like a bad idea when there are places with higher energy states.
Finally, MAD can be accomplished in the blockchain in a way where you could have the finger on the trigger, but couldn't run with the money. I dont see anything like that implemented on your site, yet its as simple as generating proper multisig tx. With USD you'll need to hold the money, no way around that.
Verdict: I'll buy the domain for 0.2BTC, you can keep the bootstrap template.

Indeed, what I  described is forex because ultimately thats the way to replace dolar-pegged currencies like LR or Paypal.
Corporate equity issues are natural, well researched property of colored coins (with voting, dividends), easy and transparent to implement, so you'll most likely see that first :)

Expanding as requested:
1) You need an escrow service so that job submitter does not screw the job solver and vice versa. Submitter might claim the result is fake and refuse to pay even if the work was done. Conversely, solver might just crack the DRM and submit fake results. Using PoW-type problems is really not good answer, because it cripples utility severely to small subset of problems (basically anything "brute force" like discrete logarithm, knapsack, traveling salesman, monte carlo...).
2) Given 1., centralized solutions are superior because things can work at much faster pace, in a well-defined environment (memory, disk usage, bandwith) and on any kind of problem.
Interesting twist to partially solve 1) would be submit the work to nothing-up-my-sleeve-for-everyone randomized set of solvers and cross-check the results.
Net result? I think for password cracking it'd be still cheaper to just exchange bitcoins for dollars and buy EC2 GPU instances. Because BitCompute workers would refuse my job which needs 70GB of rainbow tables...

p2ptrade ensures the trade is atomic between two colors, or color and btc, nothing more. The rest is external infrastructure.
Alice issues AliceUSD, bob issues BobUSD. Those custom currencies are similiar to e-gold or LR - cannot be exchanged directly for fiat, can go belly up, fractionally debase etc, and often will. The key idea is to hedge - you buy 1000$ of AliceUSD, and then exchange it for basket of 1000 different colors from other issuers ($1 each) and trade for everything using that basket. You do the reverse once you want to cash out fiat - you trade the basket for 1000$ AliceUSD, give it to Alice, and she sends you your fiat.
Then, there are market mechanisms to assure alice and bob are honest issuers (such as fidelity bonds, market indexes, rating agencies...).
Other people trade using IOUs (I Owe You token) Alice and Bob (and 1000 other issuers) created.
Alice and Bob could be of course big company with MSB license, or just random OTC guy with his paypal account. Because at the end of the day, there is no other way to exchange fiat for IOUs.

The hardware/software will be probably closed at first to deter copycats from nibbling the ROI. At some point source code will be released, hopefully. Users will trust it anyway simply because they trust slush (the neckbeard behind the project runs the oldest mining pool).
I'll certainly wait for source code release and possibly chinese clone before buying trezor (its rumoured to be quite expensive at first - about 100 eur to cool down the initial demand spike).
I belive only off-the-shelf chips are used, ie there is no place to hide something evil on hw level at that point. You can compile and upload everything from scratch, and then blow the programming fuse to ensure integrity.

For the IOUs it is exactly like Ripple except you need BTC to pay the fees, not pre-mined fiat called XRP :)

This is quite old problem and has been repeated on  irc over and over past two months for little to no effect (band aids like rate limiting at best).
&lt;conspiracy&gt;When mtgox is sued, magical throwaway captain obvious appears&lt;/conspiracy&gt;
Nevertheless, publishing exploits like this is probably the only way to get get this fixed somehow, so please, for the love of satoshi and everything dear to him, upvote op!

Newbies tend to overestimate their engineering skill (and usually economic implications) and refuse to lurk more at the same time.
[It's a common sight in the bitcoin world for hundreds of newbies to come up with new, revolutionary, paradigm shiftting and usually fundamentally flawed ideas all at the same time.](
[NooShare]( is the actual stuff, and even then there are serious engineering challenges.
Without PoW there is huge bootstrap problem with why bitcoin, why not paypal?
