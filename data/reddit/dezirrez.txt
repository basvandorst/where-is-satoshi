It going up to 100k by the next halving wouldn't even be that impressive at this point unless there is a way to prove bitcoin would keep going up by 1000% between halvings, which absolutely ain't possible. Bitcoin price is determined by what people are willing to pay for it, no algoritm can count this out. Everyone talking about what the price will be of bitcoin here and there are just guessing unless they themselves plan to buy like 10m bitcoins for 100k and force the price up and stay there, and I want to see anyone capable of that.

When you tried so hard but don't succeed.

Simple, have 1 bitcoin address just for donations but keep your personal ones private.
If someones that interested in it can they only see how much you were donated.

Damn you're only shopping on the dark web or smth? I feel like there is way too few places that accept cryptos still in late 2019.

People sure love drawing lines on a graph

You believe anyone will give bitcoin for free? Laughable, I wouldn't bother with it.

If you need to ask you already know the answer.

@_date: 2019-08-20 04:34:11
Why would anyone think someone would give you 2x bitcoin? Ofc no one gives shit for free.

It's a pure scam.

Brute force break it, your own fault for writing it in the wrong order and losing valuable bitcoin, only 10E70 possible combinations, have a good time.

Why would you wave a flag with how much money you have invested?
It's straight up for your own security.

Congratulations, you are too stupid to get the joke. Get out of here you potato.

Get lost potato. This is a discussion subreddit, not an advertising one for fraudy ass gambling site.
@_date: 2019-09-05 09:17:41
Congratulations, you can draw lines on a graph.

Get out of here you potato. This is a discussion subreddit, not a gambling one that's for you to advertise.

Of course it does, why you so serious and sensitive? He very obviously drew a circle on the graph, so it 100% applies. And by simple means you can't predict the future with a graph, all you can see is how it reacted in the past which is still guesswork that it's going to happen again. All of these guides are just fake, therefore the "joke" about drawing on a graph. 
Having to explain yourself to a lower being over a joke is utterly annoying, so in all honesty and sincerity, get bent.
Btw, "Potato" is not a swearing, sincerly, a human that just destroyed you.

Your sons chances for a long future decreased a bit with this picture. If only you knew what people would do to a hodler, no one knows if you got 0.1 btc or 100 btc. Some sick human is possible to search you up and find out himself, why risk it for some attention?

Get out of here you damn potato.
