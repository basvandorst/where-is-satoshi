Even in a super liberal city like Seattle, it's still 50-50. A lot of the people here are Bern-outs who didn't like it when he 'sold out' and switched parties

Don't forget Mountain Dew and Doritos and EOTech sights for drum fed nuclear powered automatic shotguns with tracer rounds and a boombox quad rail attachment.

Seems to be a good spread of books, unsure if the $15 tier is worth it (unless for some reason you really want to read about (*shudders*) Oracle.) unless you're looking to get into programming.

No. Check my post history. I'm not cool enough to be in charge of anything.

The top nav bar on your website for mobile devices persuaded me to close it and not bother reading the other half of the page that wasn't obstructed. The size of it isn't the issue, but rather the fact that it's sticky and gets in the way of browsing. Cool idea though.

No thank you, I know how to build my own, and I have expensive tastes. :P

Read the entire thing you doofus. I bought the humble bundle!

Because I work in network security, and sometimes people would rather pay in Bitcoins to avoid international transaction fees, maintain anonymity, or even just try to be edgy!
I could just transfer them to Mt Gox and get USD, sure, but that'd take a few days, and I don't mind spending a few extra dollars to make sure that some awesome people have a job :)

I'm extremely lucky I sold when I heard about the Chinese exchange fiascos :x But I believe in the currency, so when it drops I'll buy more. Hopefully people weren't stupid enough to pump all their money into high risk investments :(

I shot you guys an email over the weekend! Hahaha, that's awesome. I'll have to go ahead and fine tune the parts and see about getting you guys to order all my computer stuff for me!
