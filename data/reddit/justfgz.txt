Interesting thought here, thanks for sharing and the same goes for me: Being in Crypto made me handle my money and expenses a LOT better than before.

At a specific time yes, once a year, in fiat currency. With a substantial roof before a higher tax comes around.
Can't imagine giving them every trade lol.

Maybe august 15th was chosen because august 15th 1971 President Nixon completed the break from the Gold standard. But just a guess as I simply googled for some events that day.

In Zimbabwe this one buys you exactly 1 Cow (tear off the rightside part of note and hand it to a local cow-seller.)

I use Surfshark VPN (after having NordVPN for several years) and I really like it! Speeds are more far stable than NordVPN, supports torrenting and multi-vpn and I got a really good deal for a 3-year subscription. They also update their software a lot and never had any issue on both Linux and Windows 7/10 systems. Absolutely recommended!

A while ago Electrum had this exact problem, with outdated versions giving fake 'update' messages that installed malware when clicked.
