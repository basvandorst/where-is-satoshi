Anyone worth their weight in the bitcoin community will tell you that one of the negatives to something like bitcoin is that there is NO way to tell if it's the be all to end all cryptocurrencies, and many supporters even agree that it likely WON'T be the top dog(no pun intended) when it's all said and done. 
It's not like that isn't true for any other cryptocurrency as well, though. People putting large savings into any of them is gambling, no other way to put it. I don't think that it's something the community ignores, though. It's been discussed since day 1.

There are plenty of ways to create and sign a transaction safely offline and you only need to be online to send the transaction. If the transaction is altered after it's signed it won't work.

Exactly. His site was selling illegal goods and he was taking a fee from said sales, knowing that the transaction was not legal in the first place. It's not like he's Amazon and one of their sellers tried to sell drugs before Amazon caught on and terminated their account...Silk Road knew the drugs were being sold and continued to allow it, while making a profit from those sales. In the eyes of the law I imagine that pretty much equates him being a seller himself.

Unsure why, but to quote from the wikipedia page for [Sales taxes in the United States]( 
"Since services and intangibles are typically not taxed, the distinction between a taxable sale of tangible property and a nontaxable service or intangible transfer is a major source of controversy."

Some feel they cashed out too early and want to buy back in, so they want a lower price. Some feel that bitcoin should fail (yes, even here in the bitcoin subreddit, they are just a silent minority) and get upset and downvote simply for that reason. Others, even bitcoin enthusiasts, may feel that the constant talk of price increase, especially high price increase, is too much of a circlejerk and they get sick of seeing it. Among other reasons, I'd say those are the most common.

To my understanding, he's also known as The Madhatter on the forum, though I believe he denied it. I talked with madhatter very early into bitcoin, when the forum had less than 50 members and we talked about him owning a VOIP, looking for partners to help with the exchange of real currency to and from bitcoin for his clients. It was obvious from the start that he was close to mybitcoin, often claiming he was having e-mail conversations with the owner ( for an example). He also owned the bitcoin4cash.com service. 
I'm not sure if it was ever proven Madhatter was connected but it certainly seemed like he was the same person as the Mybitcoin owner.

Moneypaks aren't debit cards or prepaid cards. They're reloads for such cards. $5 at the store gets you a moneypak code up to $500. Once you give that code to whoever is selling bitcoins for moneypaks, they reload their prepaid card, or even paypal since they can be used there, and send the bitcoins. Moneypak prepaid cards are non-refundable after the code has been used.

Well obviously you want the lowest price, but where the price is going from here is pure speculation. Spacing out your buys would probably help keep the price from spiking but the market right now is not stable enough to predict how slow to space them out or whether or not it would even be worth it. 
Personally I'd stick to one or two exchanges to minimize record keeping and any ID verification, especially if you're buying Bitcoins and can then quickly move them out of your account. Multiple exchanges could ensure you are always getting the best price, however.

Have had e-mails with bonanza.com and they said the same thing. They initially give you three or four payment options, paypal, google checkout and money orders (Edit: And Amazon checkout). They told me if I wanted people to pay with bitcoins, I should put the payment option as Money Order and then specify in the details on how to use bitcoin to pay. I think you need 3+ feedback on bonanza before you can use something besides google checkout and paypal to collect payment, but you can even import your selling feedback from ebay and if you've sold more than three things there, you can use the money order option right away.
Bonanza is a pretty big competitor in terms of auction sites besides the ebay giant. I don't know much about classfy.com

Nanaimo was a dick when he used to post on the forum. Any complaint about his service was dealt with in arguments more than anything. I can't cite or even remember specifics, but some forum searching should be easy. During the mybitcoin hack, he was also believed by myself and others to be involved with the user Madhatter, who was believed to be involved in the hack or behind the scenes of the site. Again, I can't cite specifics, I never went through any investigation and don't much care to, but there were a lot of similarities in the bunch. Take what I say with a grain of salt, but from Nanaimos personality alone I would steer clear.

Without any risk? Not a chance. If someone can use dollars to pay for assassinations, the same would be true for bitcoin. However, even with tor and bitcoin, it would be hard to stay anonymous because this would draw intense investigations within bitcoin and the network, much more so than things like drugs. Tor does not make you 100% anonymous, but makes it much harder and more costly to find you. Time and money a government would gladly use to track down assassins. 
Either way, assassination markets like this probably exist out there already with other payment methods, and I doubt the "pros" that could easily hide their source of income already would even want to dabble in bitcoin, where the block chain can be used as incontrovertible proof against you.

You could always use lastpass. Now they have the option to use google authenticator to log into your account. As long as you make an extra long password for Mt. gox, always use autofill so you aren't typing it out, and use google authenticator for lastpass login, that should be excellent security.

Non-reversible currency is not an easy thing to trade on the internet. You either have to pay for speed (transaction fees) or go through more proper channels, like Dwolla, so the seller can be assured a scam is not as possible
And you can't really expect it to be easy yet. If I could buy bitcoins at the general store, it would make the process incredibly easier, but bitcoin is not close to that popularity yet. More popularity and more use will bring easier and better payment options. If you want instant payment speeds, like debit cards or credit cards, you have to pay for it in the transaction fees, which is made to cover their losses from scammers who use the reversible nature of credit cards to their advantage. You can't get away from that with internet transactions.

Yes many use Armory, it's even listed on the bitcoin.org website for choosing a wallet ( 
Code can be read [here]( if you're savvy enough. If not I guess you'd have to trust the other reviews up to this point.
He can't push an update like that to clients, clients would have to manually download the new version where he pushed the update. If you're worried of that, don't download the newest version unless it's had a bit of time to be tested (if you can't read the code and see for yourself).
Yes, using armory offline would save you from anyone stealing your coins, but to send coins you need to use an online computer as well. 
The wallets being different formats is not an issue, as you can export the private keys from one client into the other. If you want to make sure a private key that Armory creates is genuine and matches up to the public address it says it does, save bitaddress.org offline, punch in the private key, and it will tell you the associated address.

About 15 years ago, we had a side project in grade school where we would invest our play money in stocks and see how we fared by the end of the year. I invested most of my money into APPL.
Apple didn't do GREAT that year, but when I see the price now compared to then, I can't help to think what if I actually did have that money, and invested it that way. 
Of course, I was only in grade school and I just thought of computers as the future, so "invested" in APPL, without much reason beyond that. It's sorta nice to dream "what if" sometimes though.

Agreed, if you're ready to lose it, then go ahead and invest. But first, learn, read, learn. Read some more and learn some more. Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme, and should be understood at least on a basic level before diving in with cash. Learn the upsides of different wallets, how to save or back up private keys, learn how to secure yourself. 
If it falls to $5 (which is probably even less likely than it hitting $50), you aren't losing that much at a few hundred dollars, but the potential upside is unbelievable to think about. Consider the money lost until bitcoins are worth something that is meaningful compared to your initial investment.
Large investors have a bit more to worry about but a few hundred dollars should only be invested if you believe in the potential and are willing to wait for it even if it takes years. Putting that money in bitcoin to try and make a quick double on your cash, you're better off betting 50/50 at Satoshidice

Bitcoin lets you write transactions without private keys, and sign them offline so they can be broadcasted later. With clients like Electrum and Armory (maybe Multibit and others too?), they make the process easy by having watch only wallets. Watch only wallets don't store private keys, only can show balances of the public keys in your wallet. 
You tell electrum you want to send .05 bitcoins from Address1, to Address2. Electrum can then create the transaction, but it can't be broadcasted to the blockchain until it's signed with the private keys.
So you save the transaction to a text file on your usb, and plug it in your offline pc. Open electrum on your offline pc, and you can then open and sign your transaction with your private keys.
Edit: An online pc is needed to create the initial transaction because it needs to see which address has which coins and how many it has. 
Bring the usb back to the online pc, open the transaction in electrum again and it will show that it's signed, then you just send the transaction. This does not give your online pc access to your private keys, it just can prove that the transaction is legitimate. Also, the transaction cannot be changed in any way, or you would have to resign the transaction with your private keys. So if anything malicious on your online pc were to try and change the transaction, it would not work.

An "exchange" using colored coins or otherwise using the bitcoin protocol would still need to be centralized to trade most currencies/securities. For example, if I give you 1 colored coin for 1 USD, you're going to need to come to me  (or whoever you gave your colored coin to would need to come to me) to withdraw that dollar if you ever want it back. Trust about who issued the USD equivalent colored coin is important too, otherwise you just have a digital token that some random bitcoiner claims is worth a dollar. 
This makes exchanges between digital currencies easier as there is no central authority such as the dollar, but an exchange using colored coins would still be easy for governments to find and prosecute if they weren't following the proper laws and regulations.

If it's really a problem, we start using mBTC or similar, which is to be considered .001 bitcoin. 1 mBTC is about 14 cents now.
If you're paying someone with paypal, you have to type their email address in, so it's the same as copy and pasting a bitcoin address. Services like coinbase with online checkout buttons makes it as easy as paypal.
A public ledger is necessary to prove authenticity of your coins without a third party controlling that information. 
Bitcoin is young as hell. If you want it to be as usable as paypal, you'll have to wait until it matures more.

Fee is .1% of your deposit, but if that .1% is less than $15, you will be charged $15 instead. For example, if you deposit $1000, .1% of $1000 is $1, so instead of being charged $1, you would be charged $15.

Bitstamp is a fine solution for U.S. account holders, and has better customer service than 95% of bitcoin businesses out there. The fees are not high as has been said, commission starts at .5%, compared to coinbases 1%. 
Yes you must trust them with verification, as you do with most exchanges that are worthwhile, in an attempt to follow their local laws. If this makes you uncomfortable then don't use them, but this doesn't mean that they are "not safe". [Here]( is their anti-money laundering policy with explains the UK AML policy in some detail, and how they approach the process, and there's no holdups along the way. 
After submitting for verification, the process is easy. trade for dollars, wire dollars to bank. Their bank wires usually take no more than one or two business days to clear, and then another day or two to reach your bank. A MUCH better experience than can currently be had with Mt. Gox.

Youtube commenters are like the kid down the street that acts so stupid you don't know if he really has mental problems or he's just making an act. Would be nice for some channels, but the comments would be filled with misunderstandings and negative feedback loops for the majority of youtube. We're some time away still, but video descriptions sometimes have bitcoin donation addys in them! Wouldn't hurt to ask your favorite channel, though.

Those types of addresses in which are trusted with 0 confirmations are considered green addresses. Mt Gox has one, and I think others have them too (Instawallet used to). If you have bitcoins in Mt Gox, use their green address to send someone money and they have very little risk of double spend, unless they believe Mt. Gox would do that, which is highly improbable.

That would work fine yes. Someone can correct me if wrong, but I believe your backup is good for 100 transactions before you have to backup your wallet again, because it will need new change addresses added to the wallet. 
Wallet encryption should be fine for pocket money, on a personal computer as long as you don't browse suspicious sites often. I wouldn't worry about bitcoins worth less than you'd carry on you in a day. The likelihood of anything happening to them is very low.

Yes, days before when Roman initially sent out emails telling people to withdraw their funds. The bank never allowed that withdrawal.

What is wrong with bitfloor in your opinion that you would say it isn't one doing things by the book?
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:17:32
Well to be quite frank once you put your bitcoins on the exchange, you essentially give him control, and that means he can do what he pleases. You never sign a terms and conditions or any contractual agreement saying that the bitcoins are and forever will be yours.
It could also be argued that he could have claimed this with the USD deposited on bitfloor, but that would have created a gigantic shitstorm that he couldn't deal with.
When those bitcoins are deposited into bitfloor (or mt gox, or bitstamp, etc), if you are not entering into some sort of agreement that states otherwise, any one of them could walk out at anytime with all of the deposits on their site. You gave them control of your bitcoins.

This is a point I hear a lot and I hear it so often used in the incorrect way. You're halfway correct, bitcoin as a tool does NOT rely on the exchange price and the well oiled machine is working as good now as it was a month ago.
The exchange rate certainly does matter when 95% of the goods you need to live are priced in dollars or other fiat currency. It matters when the goods priced in bitcoins are usually pegged to the dollar. If I were to put money in bitcoin and take it out the next week or purchase something next week when it's lost double or more of it's value, that's very important to me. Of course that's why we tell people over and over to only invest what you can lose because it's so young and volatile...but I believe it's improper to say outright that the exchange rate doesn't matter one bit. The functionality is still the same, but it still does matter.

Half the fee is NOT in bitcoin. When you buy or sell, the fee is taken from your cash balance. When you buy a bitcoin, lets just say at $100, they take their fee (.3% or 30 cents) and then give $99.70 worth of bitcoins, or 99.7% of what you spent, or .997 bitcoins. The seller has the fee taken from the proceeds.
Options on Mt. Gox can have them take the fee from your account balance rather than the trade itself but it makes no difference.

It's a better system than our current online payment processors. There are more possibilities from provably fair gambling to better escrow. I am not a hardcore libertarian or anarchist but I do believe I should have the ability spend my money where I'd like online. If sites like Wikileaks are harassed and blackballed through the payment processors circle, bitcoin can still be used to give them the donation they deserve. 
The idea of cash for the internet is really something that opens up possibilities in a lot of different sectors.

Robots, or automated work, likely doesn't create less jobs, just a shift of what type of work is being done. In fact, it would likely create MORE jobs than it would eliminate. You'd still need maintenance and repair, designers, programmers, engineers, and many more than there currently are. An entire transition in our education system and what core values are taught would be completely rewritten to a more computer oriented lesson plan.
Just because the mundane work is done by machines, doesn't mean that there aren't MANY humans behind those machines taking care of them.

The wash sale rule is only for capital losses if I understand correctly. It prevents someone from selling to claim a loss only to rebuy into the market quickly after.
If he bought at $100 and they dropped to $50, the wash sale rule would prevent him from selling, claiming the loss then buying again the next day.

No, never use your bitcoins with parties you don't trust. 
Are you surprised that bitcoin is still in it's infancy or something? As has been pointed out, plenty of TRUSTWORTHY businesses allow you to spend bitcoin. From reddit to wordpress to namecheap to humble bundle or gyft. Brick and mortar stores that are popping up here and there as well. If the individuals you are dealing with are known and they scam you, you have just as much legal recourse as if you were spending cash. If you need to buy something from somewhere that the owners are not easily identified, just don't be that surprised if the day comes where it vanishes. 
If amazon or ebay accepted bitcoins, it's reasonable to have trust with them. If I buy reddit gold with bitcoin, it's reasonable for them to be trusted and if they don't provide the service/goods I can find them easily enough and take them to court. Just because you're using their services with bitcoin instead of USD doesn't give them any more leeway to not compensate you.

Different exchanges are owned by different companies and/or individuals. These exchanges are based in many different countries, and use different currencies. Some of them are more trustworthy, whether it's because the owners are well-known, or because they've been in business for a while.
Volume on an exchange usually translates to a fair trading price, since many buys and sells are going on throughout the day to find an equilibrium in price, but some exchanges like Mt. Gox have higher prices than others mostly because of their problems withdrawing USD, making their exchange unsatisfactory. 
Exchanges use different deposit/withdrawal methods. Most seem to at least use bank wires, but depending on the exchange they can also use other financial institutions like Dwolla. 
You should care about one that seems suitable for your needs and trades in your local currency. If you only plan on buying/selling 1 or 2 bitcoins, maybe something like Campbx is sufficient. If you're going to trade more often, maybe something like Bitstamp.

Write the transactions from something like an electrum or armory watch address on your online computer.

My uncle saw the Lang and O'Leary Exchange clip on tv where they were talking about bitcoins, and they had Amir as the spokesperson for bitcoin.

Amir stole the attention from my uncle and he focused on him rather than seeing bitcoin the first time on tv after I've talked so much about it.
No, he's a developer. My uncle doesn't know much about computers and that difference meant little to him. Amir is a joke when it comes to who should be speaking for us.

It's not at all like a bank run. A bank going into default in such situations would be because they don't have enough cash to dish out all who wish to withdraw. Mt Gox isn't taking the money you deposit and spending it, it's simply held in their account until you wish to withdraw it, or trade it. Their profit is from fees. They're never going to have less than the total amount deposited to them, so a bank run isn't going to happen that would cause bankruptcy.

The only way that would happen is 
1. If you saved a copy of the wallet before encrypting it. This wallet can be used without a password if someone gets hold of it.
2. You have a weak password. If they steal your wallet and you have a weak password, there's little you can do. It would be hacked quickly. 
3. Keylogger or screen capture virus that can view your password being entered. 
Encryption is as safe as you can get for an online wallet, but for these reasons and others, it's always recommended to hold large sums OFFLINE, where keyloggers, viruses, malware etc can't affect your system.

Adoption creates value. Value creates adoption. Bitcoin was once worth less than a penny each. Were they supposed to stay that low? Even if they only rose from a penny to two cents in a year, that's a 100% increase in worth. It's way too young to compare bitcoin with other currencies and rates.

Yep. Offline dedicated PC for around $100 will be perfect. 
1. Create transaction with watch only Armory wallet
2. Copy tx to usb or even cd-r, and sign it with offline pc. Here's where you double check your transaction is correct.
3. Copy signed tx to online pc and triple check the transaction is right. 
$100 cheap PC is a small investment if you're storing large amounts of bitcoins.

Well you need to decide how many keys you want to share (family members in this circumstance), and how many shares are necessary to unlock the secret.
Lets say 5 shares for family members, and one for yourself. You want more than one share to unlock the secret, otherwise any one individual can gain access to your funds. 
You could set it up so deathswitch.com has a share, you have a share kept in a special spot, and all five family members have a share. You could set three keys necessary to be the threshold to unlock the secret, and if only one family member is alive at the time the secret needs to be found, tell them beforehand or even in your deathswitch.com email, how to find YOUR secret key, and how to use the secret keys they already own, yours, and the one from deathswitch to unlock the secret using something like passguardian.com
Thing is that whatever the threshold is, say 3, all you need is any of those 3 keys. If three shady family members that hold keys work together they could unlock the secret. You also don't want the threshold too high because if you lose too many of the keys then the secret is lost to those who don't already know it.
So I guess there isn't any suitable way to have BOTH conditions you stated. If only one person survived, you could do something like their key, your key and your lawyers key necessary to unlock, but that's a threshold of 3 and if there's six or seven keys including your family's, then any of those 3 can unlock the secret.

What about the paid version of sandboxie? Too pricey...but from my understanding you can do what's called a Force Folder, in which you can force an entire drive or folder to open in a sandbox. The only info that can get out is what you allow, so you'd plug in your usb (mapped with force folder in sandboxie), open armory, then I believe you have to transfer the transaction to your computer first out of the sandbox, then load it into armory. That way the only thing leaving the usb is the text file that contains the transaction. You may be able to simply copy and paste outside the sandbox but I'm not sure.

@_date: 2013-07-26 15:33:49
Like I've tried telling you, there was no warning sign besides the bank giving Roman a hard time. Roman privately sent an email (I'm assuming to heavy users) to withdraw funds because of bank issues days before closure, I'd guess to expedite the large transfers. After that is when people started panicking because some people received the email and some hadn't. It didn't matter, the bank did not even give him enough time to release funds and immediately shut his bank account down. They warned Roman about his business practices and shut him down essentially within days. If he would have made a public statement it wouldn't have mattered anyways. 
And I'm not even sticking up for Roman, I'd never do business with him again. People shouldn't be called "careless" or told to learn their lesson when the accusers have no idea what they're talking about. There's a lot of people around here that like to say "See! Told you so! Told you so! Did you learn your lesson? I knew all along!" and most don't know half the story.

Examples and comparisons to modern day ledgers (credit cards, your banks internal transactions, etc) are usually where I start when trying to introduce non-tech savvy individuals to bitcoin. By explaining bitcoin as just an automated ledger at first, if they can understand that then I go onto explaining it more into detail (block creation, finite supply, supply and demand). 
Take it slow and let them ask questions if they don't get anything. People need to understand this on a simple level before it's explained too much in detail.

It would need to be a gimmick more than presenting all it's values. Something to catch the attention of the audience, and give them something to relate to. 
I'd show a country, pick your poison, semi-content. You can show camera views of the street and see everyone driving, riding their bikes, walking down the sidewalk, just like most average days. 
An inflation rate flashes on the screen, black background, for a second or two, and it goes back to the scene where we started. A few seconds later, the black screen comes back and the inflation rate has grown. A headline is quoted as saying the economy is in a downfall. The streets are shown again, same camera angles as before, and the restlessness is visible. A business is shown in the background closing up shop, restless faces on the street and maybe even some arguing back and forth. 
Black screen. Higher inflation rate. "Dollar/Euro/Peso/etc has dropped in value, country panics", "Country in critical debt", "Your choice of headline"
Same streets. Same angles. Protests are shown in front of the bank, two fat guards standing in front of the doors. Homeless man across the street with a sign "Will work for food, don't want your $"
Black screen. Higher inflation rate. Headlines.
Protests have increased. Streets are shut down. Police with riot gear in front of the bank. Homeless man is lying still(dead?) across the street, but no one seems to notice. Buildings have broken windows, fires in the streets, etc. 
Black screen and inflation rate and these scenarios keep showing and speeds up in duration, until the sound of rioting men grows high in intensity, the city is rushing the police and the inflation rate screen and street scene are flashing back and forth very fast. 
Then the sounds stop. The black screen is back, but blank. Then pops up 
Decentralized. Controlled Supply. Owned by the people, for the people.

We only need this now because the current exchanges just can't handle that amount of trades at once. The problem  of thousands of tiny trades WILL go away when we have more advanced trading platforms, or maybe even when Mt Gox pushes their new platform in a month or two, that can handle all of the trades at once, because then it won't even be a problem. Market manipulation won't go away but thousands of trades at once locking up the market will be a problem that can go away in due time.

When have I said client side wallets are inherently secure? The simple fact is web-based wallets, no matter how properly setup are insecure by the simple nature of being operated by individuals other than yourself. It is too easy for them to steal, or to "lose", coins and not be held accountable when it happens, one needs only to look at history to see that. Bitfloor, Bitcoinica, Instawallet and Mybitcoin all come to mind. 
To say a wallet where you don't control your own keys and your bitcoins aren't somehow insured, can EVER be secure is the real disservice here.

You might net a couple of dumb crooks who steal coins or runs a shady business with one address and never moves them, but once they're moved once, you have no idea if the new owner is a unwilling participant in the crime or not.

I wasn't making an excuse for that. MY point was simply that a site that is handling thousands of coins day in and out should definitely be held more accountable for their security compared to a forum that doesn't exchange any money, and accordingly, bitcointalk should get less "flak" for it.
