You are right that this isn't solid proof, but I think it is very likely MtGox owned the BTC after the deposit.
Could you explain 'erase unconfirmed transactions'? :)

Maybe more wallets can be found the same way I found the previous one. (Here I show how I found another presumably MtGox owned wallet)
1. Search for a big 'identifiable' deposit by a user. [user makes deposit](
2. Check the deposit timestamp (I found 1737.238 BTC deposit at *2012-05-19 19:36:00*)
3. Go to blockchain.info and find the exact same BTC transaction amount made just before MtGox confirmed the deposit *2012-05-19 19:36:00*
	(navigate the blocks by changing the timestamp 
	So it probably is [transaction ad7a7e65...]( (at *2012-05-19 18:04:12*)
4. So we can assume the BTC is at MtGox when confirmed in the blockchain. [address 1AGA2t...](

No, it was to clarify this big deposit was made *after* the 2011 theft so the BTC should be at MtGox that moment. The move of BTC at 2014-03-07 makes sense if it were MtGox BTC or at least related to the insolvency event.
I posted this so other people might link these wallets with other wallets and find some info. Maybe people can see some expected or unexpected behaviour compared to other wallets of MtGox.

It *proofs* [address 14cVQSQ7...]( was MtGox'.
Also, I did not see anything that looks like the transaction malleability MtGox was talking about (spending the same amount twice). So it could be some proof that they never lost it with the TM.
Edit: 
~~Isn't it weird that the [transaction 02aa71ee...]( can not be found at [coinsight.org - 02aa71ee](
Edit2: I expect the BTC moved after 2014-03-07 from [address 1MyGwFAJ...]( will show up in the somewhere at coinsight.org after they split the BTC. It would proof they never lost control of the BTC right? I Assume they own the BTC that are broadcasted by coinsight.org.

I found a matching deposit of 14,000 BTC to MtGox in the blockchain and the leaked DB and did a simple investigation by only following the big transactions.
On the website [mark-karpeles.com]( with leaked info there was a deposit by someone with the [user id:255]( (individual does not matter) to MtGox. His first deposit was 14,000 BTC on 2011-08-24 08:38:01 which can be found at the bottom of the user page.
This [deposit transaction afd27ea7...]( can be found at in the blockchain to what I assume MtGox' address [address 14cVQSQ7...](
I will use a timeline:
1. At 2011-06-19 [MtGox theft](
2. At **2011-08-24** 07:48 the [transaction afd27ea7...]( was the deposit of 14,000 BTC to MtGox [address 14cVQSQ7...](
3. At 2011-08-27 01:30 the [transaction ec028b2d...]( merged the 14,000 BTC to [address 1AMDs5sX...]( to a total of 50,000 BTC at that time.
4. At 2011-08-27 02:29 the [transaction ca509df6...]( moved 50,000 BTC to [address 1GvPbnnZ...](
5. At 2011-09-11 15:34 the [transaction 232ca49a...]( moved 50,000 BTC to [address 14dRd6Fd...](
6. At 2011-11-16 05:38 the [transaction ed8b4373...]( is splitting the 50,000 BTC. The [address 1Eve4Ywa...]( had 40,000 BTC and the [address 1JfBvzEE...]( had 10,000 BTC. *(I will only follow the 40,000 BTC address)*
7. At **2011-11-16** 05:45 the [transaction e33b53c6...]( is splitting the 40,000 BTC. The [address 1MyGwFAJ...]( had 29,999.99 BTC and the [address 17e4MNwK...]( had 10,000 BTC. *(I will only follow the 29,999.99 BTC address)*
8. At 2014-02-25 MtGox [halts trading](
9. At **2014-03-07** 05:01 the [transaction 02aa71ee...]( is splitting the 29,999.99 BTC from [address 1MyGwFAJ...](
I think the timestamps are the important parts here...
