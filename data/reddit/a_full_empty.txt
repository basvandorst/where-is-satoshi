whoa, amazing that the person making the video got the exact result they were looking for in their totally real and authentic experiment. just like how on those ghost hunter shows they always manage to find a ghost.

i mean if you stop the gif when he's fully submerged then yeah it will be a timeless representation of bitcoin
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:15:31


take all your money out of bitcoin and then stop buying bitcoin
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:16:05
wow you are just dead set on embarrassing yourself, huh?
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:06:39
everyone seems to care a whole lot about the price when it's going up
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:05:01
how are there still true believers left as this point? like good lord, are there people still waiting on the return from the money they invested with madoff as well?
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:16:20
"you lost how much??? why didn't you just cut your losses?"
"well you see a meme told me not to and anonymous internet people would be mad at me if i did"
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:53:10
the future is now, and it's still shit.

came for the stench of desperation, was not disappointed
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:00:09
buy low sell lower
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:56:37
It still cracks me up that people will be losing money, but then see a meme that says "if you cut your losses i'll think you're a weak loser and i won't be your friend anymore" and then they are like wow guess i better listen to this internet guy.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:22:54
the government is the manager and enforcer of the capitalist class because


people who rail against the government but think capitalism is wonderful are entirely missing the point. as are the people who think they can somehow trick the capitalists out of their wealth and power with crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:11:48
past performance is not indic-ah fuck it who cares at this point, yes OP it's absolutely going to the moon. you should get a second mortgage on your house and liquidate your assets so you can buy buy buy!

good job owning your mother in law with a gift she didn't want and then bragging about it on reddit i guess
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:51:30
tell me again why you guys turned to digital beanie babies instead of socialism? i mean did you think you were gonna trick the capitalists into handing over their wealth and power? maybe after all this collapses you guys will realize that seizing the means of production isn't just a meme, it's the only way forward.
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:02:03
I, too, see constant crashes as a sign of long term health. Can't wait to buy buy buy!
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:54:30
ok but what if, now bear with me here because apparently this is an incredibly difficult concept for people to consider, but what if the workers *also owned the capital*
i'll give a few minutes to pick up the fragments of your brain from the floor.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:15:11
the best part about bitcoin crashes is that it brings all the baghdad bobs out.
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:00:44


I know, right? It's like shitting on EA for their microtransactions.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:03:54
Currently on the front page there is a post about how nobody has friends that give a shit about bitcoin, a post about some fucking sandwich shop using bitcoin, and this. Truly amazing.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:44:38
awareness peaked when the price peaked. all the people who bought the hype got burned and will never touch it again. show's over folks. tell the last person who is still screaming HODL into the void to shut the lights off when they leave.
@_date: 2019-02-24 19:56:29
Lmao go look at the Google trends search volume for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-11-26 19:17:58
boy this was a rollercoaster of a post. i like the part in the middle where you suddenly realize he's a drawing.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:02:51
True, but it certainly has been sold that way to a lot of idiots.

of all the stupid bullshit that bitcoin has brought about, the fact that people are returning to divination has to be the funniest.
