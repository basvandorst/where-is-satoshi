"Just this week, 15 global banks, including Wells Fargo and UBS, said that they had completed a prototype of a distributed ledger that could track trade financing around the globe — providing a single record for a series of scattered, hard-to-track transactions."

But yet, small miners did shift away from CEX.io / Ghash.io, even though they had the best pool at the time with zero fees.
@_date: 2016-08-13 19:59:20
This is the answer to those feeling some centralization unease.  With a few exceptions, most pools are made up of many smaller miners, who can easily shift to another pool if/when one becomes dominant.  In fact, it already happened with CEX.io.  So we have a pretty good template of what happens.

Private blockchains are pointless.  It is better to use a centralized shared database.  Public blockchains are where it is at, period.  The banks keep repeating that public blockchains are not acceptable due to scaling and privacy issues, as if these aren't being worked on and won't be solved.  They conveniently ignore ongoing development on such projects as the Lightning Network, which will solve the scaling problem, and actually improve the privacy issues as well.

Currently, Bitcoin is used as a confiscation-resistant inflation-resistant long-term digital-gold store of value.  And it accomplishes this fantastically nearly without rival.  The medium of exchange use case is still in its early development stages with Lightning Network on the horizon.

I see I've caught a live one.  When any government body declares that a random string of digits and letters is unlawful to possess or use, we will be witnessing the epitome of attempted tyranny.  This isn't child porn.  This isn't unlawful copies of copyrighted content.  Bitcoin keys are literally random strings of digits and letters.  It is my right to own and use such random numbers under the 1st amendment of the Bill of Rights.  The Supreme Court of the United States would side with me.  They have already ruled on this during the cryptography battles of the 1990s.  The writing is on the wall.  Nobody, and no government, can put the Bitcoin baby back into its womb.  Whether they like it or not, it is here to stay.
And yes, a taking under the fifth would also be evident.  Also, potentially a violation of privacy under the fourth.  The government can't win on this.  The people will ultimately win.  The federal government is charged with protecting the rights of the people, not infringing them.

Major mining pools are mostly made up of individual miners.  I've been around long enough to remember when [Ghash.io]( almost obtained 51% of hash power, only to see individual miners re-distribute their hash power in direct response.  The re-distribution happened fairly swiftly (like within less than a week).  The individual miners did this despite the fact that [Ghash.io]( was about the only pool at the time with no fees.  Decentralized bitcoin was more important to miners than saving on a few fees.

I just don't think that (US dollar value dropping fast if "tax token" required to pay taxes) would happen.  People would just buy the tax token with US dollars, and then pay their taxes with the tax token.  All it does is add one more step to the process.  And the tax token wouldn't have much value if all you could do with it is pay your taxes.  The tax token would probably find a greater-than-zero value over time, but less than the value of the US dollar because it would be a single-use token.

Mining pools are made up of individual miners.  In the history of Bitcoin, anytime any pool got even close to 51% control of the hash power, the miners re-directed their hash power to other pools to balance it out.  The network is incentivized to maintain a balanced distribution of hash power.  In addition, China is in the process of pressuring miners to leave the country because they deem it an "undesirable."  Large mining companies have been extending their mining farms around the world as a result.

I actually think Bitcoin would become more valuable in these scenarios.  Even if an EMP took down the grid and the Internet, there will be archived nodes with a record of the blockchain since the genesis block.  As the Internet gradually came back online, Bitcoin nodes would immediately start appearing, picking back up where they left off.  Chances are, neither an EMP attack nor a nuclear holocaust would entirely cripple the grid/Internet.  Chances are, there will be at least one Bitcoin node that continues on.  That would make it even easier for the network to recover.

It's actually a much better store of value than gold.  Gold is hard to securely store and is often counterfeited.  Are those gold bars you own really solid gold or merely a gold shell with a tungsten center?  Much easier to find and steal gold than a hardware wallet.  And if you do find a hardware wallet, you need a pin to access the funds.  By the time the owner realizes his hardware wallet is stolen, he can cause the crypto to materialize somewhere else using his back-up phrase, and the thief is out of luck.

With that I disagree.  The U.S. Constitution is the highest law of the land.  All government policy and laws are subject to it.  Banning Bitcoin would also violate 4th (privacy) and 5th (illegal taking of property) amendments of the Bill of Rights.  Banning money laundering is completely different because such a ban does not infringe on these rights.

Some states are talking about directly accepting crypto for payment of taxes.  And it is rather simple to indirectly pay U.S. taxes with crypto.

The SEC continues to ensure that more people are driven to Coinbase and other crypto on-ramps, many of whom will learn about the sovereignty and control one can have over your own money.  Many will learn how to use a hardware wallet.  Many will dig deep and study Bitcoin and the crypto movement.  Many will therefore become enlightened.
Every time the SEC rejects another ETF proposal, it loses, and the crypto community wins and continues to expand.  The MSM blares that Bitcoiners are *desperate* for an ETF, as if this is the last saving grace for the space.

I think you may be wrong.  People go *out of their way* to get 1-2% airline points.  *Airline points.*  Discounts will be one of the killer apps of Bitcoin.

Not exactly right.  If the seller immediately converts the BTC to dollars (as most currently do), then there is no capital gain or loss to calculate.  Even if the seller hangs on to the BTC, if there is no realization event (no sale of the BTC) within the year, then again, there is no capital gain or loss to calculate.

Many enthusiasts instantly replenish after making a purchase, so in that sense, the money stays in Bitcoin.  The tools for doing this are much better than just a few months ago, and are still getting better.


Bitcoin is voluntary and can be accessed and owned by any and all.  The distribution starts with a high concentration and then spreads from there.  Early adopters bear the financial and reputation risk, and ought to also receive the proportional reward.  In addition, many if not most early adopters who received a windfall are reinvesting back into the ecosystem by starting companies, funding other companies, and the like.

Nonsense.  Every transaction has a cost.  It just so happens that a Bitcoin transaction has a much smaller cost and risk footprint.  The merchant will price their goods and services accordingly, providing either a discount for payment in Bitcoin or a surcharge for payment with cc.  If all of the fraudsters migrate to using credit cards, and the honest folk migrate to using Bitcoin, there will simply be a divergent price for the particular good or service that is reflected by the merchant to the consumer.  This is the correct and fair result.  The merchant accommodates both forms of payment, credit card users subsidize the inherent risk of such payment method, and Bitcoin users enjoy the benefits of using a near riskless form of payment. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:05:02
Based on my experience talking with my high-techy friends, skepticism still abounds, but they are at least willing to engage in a conversation with you.

I'm sorry, but it is simply not true.  It is merely a question of degree.  You can think of it as bad and worse.


Theories are a dime a dozen.  It is hard to predict over 100 years out.  My guess is that by then, Bitcoin will have evolved into something very different than what it is today.  Perhaps it will be the vehicle for very large transactions where the transaction fee is still relatively small.

Android devices are multipurpose devices.  While this makes them versatile, including for Bitcoin wallets, they have their weaknesses.  For example, consider the probability of hacker and virus threats, even if relatively low for a mobile Android device, still have an influence on the *perception* of Bitcoin's safety and security among the general population.  In many cases, we are battling perception.  Open source hardware wallets are specialized devices and have the benefit of both a better perception of security, as well as a better reality of security, since the threat matrix is considerably reduced.

I agree that for POS interactions, credit/debit will be hard to displace.  But for those who value the control and privacy afforded by Bitcoin, I think even POS interactions are up for grabs.
I can see myself using an open source hardware wallet not just for POS, but also for online purchases.  What is killer about the concept is that your Bitcoins are securely stored and easily accessible--with minimal effort.  Whereas with the current available tools, there is a tradeoff between security and ease of access.

Actually, I've seen quite a few posts claiming they take this (or a similar) approach.  You seem to claim quite frequently that people just want to dump their bitcoins.  Not true.  People generally want to hang on to their bitcoins.  But those who appreciate the payment network also want to use the payment network aspect of bitcoin.  This provides them the ability to do both, and in some cases, to even save money on a purchase (e.g., gyft).  And there are likely many more that do the same that don't happen to post about it.  It is a use case that makes sense and will likely grow as a payment method.  That you can't perceive the benefit does not negate the utility that is perceived by others.

That is correct.  The difference is that a $100 dollar bill loses value while BTC generally gains value over time.  If BTC were to be treated as any other currency, any gain would be subject to a tax rate that is almost always higher than capital gains rates.  That is why, in my opinion, I think it would be better to leave it as property, but with an exemption for capital gains up to a certain amount (say, $25k per year, or maybe, any purchase under $100 as suggested above).  Either that, or the IRS runs the risk of people ignoring it altogether, as is often the case with sales tax and online purchases.

The better question I think is the following: is government regulation good or bad for bitcoin?  
What do I mean by that?  I mean that bitcoin is already regulated by the laws of mathematics.

Seems about right for a $10 transaction.  But most transactions are more than $10 so the percentage transaction fee will usually be much less than 5%, and probably closer to 1 to 2%.  If you are getting a merchant discount (e.g., 6% discount from egifter.com), then most will gladly pay the 1 - 2% fee.  Even without discounts, many will want to pay the 1 - 2 % fee to support the Bitcoin network in its infancy.  Tax-related headaches aren't really a concern because you can just print out the Coinbase report at the end of the year.

In contrast, the article that I refer to above refers to the adapting the U.S. tax code to alleviate the burden somewhat on individuals.  This, I believe, is well within the realm of possibility without inciting a revolution.  After all, most would agree the current U.S. tax code is ridiculously complex and unworkable.

You present some thoughtful questions, some of which I have harbored as well.  Fundamentally though, I have found that to perceive what is actually happening in the Bitcoin space, you must at times suspend disbelief so to speak, and take a very high level view of where the technology will eventually lead.
A. Is Bitcoin sustainable?  It is as sustainable as the Internet.  People started using the Internet for various reasons.  At the end of the day, nearly all who actually used it immediately recognized its benefits.
B. What will happen when we run out of BTC?  The short answer is we won't run out of BTC because each BTC unit is infinitely divisible.
C. Doesn't the limit on coins inhibit its widespread use?  No, see B.
D. Is the public capable of being their own bank?  Perhaps not at the moment, but they will be with the introduction of miniature hardware wallets.  See, e.g.,  and 
E. If not BTC, then what?  BTC has first mover advantage and the network effect on its side.  Although not impossible to displace by other crypto-currencies, it is likely to remain the predominant one.
F. This I believe is BTC's greatest challenge.  Nevertheless, the key to shaking this association is getting people to use it for themselves.  The difference is quite stark between someone who has actually used it versus someone who hasn't.  The experience is worth more than a 1000 words, pictures, or news stories.

1) It does have direct relation to bitcoin, as bitcoin requires a significant and growing amount of energy to exist.  So, although this topic can clearly fit into other forums as well, I think it is important for the members of this forum to have access to this information.  No need to censor this.
2) You clearly did not read the paper, look at the background of the scientists making the claim, look at the reviewers, the associated universities, etc.  To lump this together with "free energy machine" without any further investigation is being somewhat myopic, in my humble opinion.

If you mention online/offline wallets, paper wallets, and the like, it should be emphasized that these are early-adopter tools.  Mass adoption will come with more intuitive tools, such as miniature hardware wallets (see e.g.,  and   To highlight my point, most of my family and acquaintances are fearful of using Bitcoin because they think they do not have the technical capability to avoid losing their Bitcoins.  That is the number one barrier to adoption.  As soon as people feel like they have the wherewithal to easily secure and spend, the potential for universal adoption is quite high.

I would prefer to see it left as property, but with a tax exemption for personal use.  This is similar to what other countries have done in Europe (and also Brazil).  The exemption could even have a limit, say, the first $20,000 of personal transactions per year are exempt from tax.  That way, the record keeping is made simple, and the long term investors can still get the favorable long term capital gains treatment.

I respectfully disagree.  I believe it is the zero fees, although in combination with the following additional features: 1) merged mining, 2) clean interface, and 3) fact that they share transaction fees with the miners.  If a company like Coinbase were to put their minds and some resources behind this, I believe they could provide respectable competition to CEX / Ghash, without the need to offer the BTC/GH trading feature.  Because of their prominence with the community, they could also attract enough miners to overcome the variance issue as well, probably within just a few weeks.

What do you mean?  This whole thread is related to the topic of volatility!  I've stated some observations, and you have yet to directly rebut them (not that you are obligated to do so, just pointing it out).

I've always thought that "consumer protection" is often used as a euphemism for "you are a bunch of incompetents and need the nanny state to take care of you."  Most people, believe or not, are quite capable of watching out for themselves. 


You keep mentioning fees, but Circle has none.  The spread is a small fraction of a typical transaction and when considering 3% + discounts, the spread is negligible.  We are still early days here as well.  Discounts just keep getting better and more prevalent with time.  Sooner or later, merchants will have to offer discounts for Bitcoin purchases just to stay competitive.  I'm not saying it will happen this year or next, but it will happen.

Maybe the question is unanswered, but bear in mind that I never said the article concluded as much.  I provided the article as an example.  If Bitcoin provides an example of a deflationary currency that is more likely to be spent than hoarded, then maybe an extrapolation can be made to other currencies, or maybe not.  There seems to be little we can go on, at least until the emergence of cryptocurrencies, which provide an interesting study on the topic.  The problem is that there are not many other deflationary currencies to compare to, other than cryptocurrencies.  We do have some history to look to given that there were periods of time when fiat currencies were not so inflationary, and periods of time when precious metals were used as currency, and that is where the Austrian-leaning theorists take significant issue with the Keynesian-leaning ones.

Volatility is not a problem needing to be fixed.  You can simply avoid it.  If you are a merchant, you directly convert to fiat at time of the transaction.

There are 60,000+ merchants who sell legal goods and also accept bitcoin.  The whole "bitcoin is only used for drugs" is a little old and can pretty easily be shown to be false.  Even the regulators dispute this and state that most drug activity involves centralized payment systems and cash.

To perceive reality as it is, not necessarily how others say it is.  This has been a life-long pursuit of mine.  It is what drives me to life.  We live in an age where information is abundant and flooding the Earth.  The primary challenge is parsing the information and deciding what is real (i.e., true) and what is not.  Conventional wisdom is often flat-out wrong.  Academic research is in an ever state of flux, and though useful at times, it is not always accurate due to political underpinnings, turf wars, and human psychology.  Perceiving reality as it is, in the flood of falsehoods, drives my purpose, and drives my life.

There are very few drawbacks, if any, to the merchant.  Because bitcoin is so ideal for merchants, many merchants offer a discount to bitcoin users, as if they were receiving cash.

1) For day-to-day mobile usage and small amounts, mobile apps work well.

Just doesn't get it.  One of the whole points of Bitcoin is to bring control to the individual.  There are degrees of safety.  A mobile wallet is great for transacting small amounts remotely and it is sufficiently secure for that use case.  A trezor is great because it solves the security / ease of use dichotomy and allows one to safely store and spend larger amounts.  Paper wallets, when created and stored properly, are the most secure and work well for life-savings type amounts.  In all of these scenarios, BTC is frickin safe for the level of safety that is called for.
@_date: 2014-05-16 05:51:40
Although some merchants offer discounts for cash, it is pretty hard to use cash over the Internet.  Merchants don't offer discounts for paying with PayPal or Venmo (as far as I'm aware).  Some merchants already offer discounts for paying with bitcoin, and that approach is on the up trend.
Problem: current payment systems too costly to merchants, who pass those costs onto the consumer.
Solution: use bitcoin so that merchant saves on transaction costs and passes savings onto consumer.
See, there is a problem, and an elegant solution.

Yes, if you hold it and then use it to purchase, there is capital gains or loss.  [LibraTax]( is a nifty little free service that automatically tracks and calculates your capital gains or losses.
My earlier comment was to correct jezuez' apparent misunderstanding that 15% was due on the purchase amount (like an outrageous sales tax or something) rather than the gain.  That is a big difference.  And if you immediately use your bitcoin after acquiring it, there is no capital gains.

Same basic approach here.  
1. Cold storage on paper for long term holdings.
2. Pheeva wallet on iPhone for pocket money.

As soon as Trezor and other open source hardware wallets are generally available, I can see myself transitioning to those, with a cold storage backup.

Most of the bitcoin hype is negative.  I'm always intrigued by those who currently claim that it would be foolish to buy bitcoin at this stage given that everybody is talking about it.

No safe harbor for the smaller innovative companies.  Can't say how many times this was suggested at the hearing--but it was quite a few.  And where is the safe harbor?  Noooowhere to be found.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:07:25
In some sense, you might be right.  But consider that this is America, not North Korea.  Any attempt to ban or significantly hinder an innovation like Bitcoin will be met with significant counter-pressure from both 1) a grass-roots community and 2) ever larger and highly capitalized companies that are in this for profit.  One of the beauties of the U.S. system is that a law on the books is not necessarily the final say--we have court systems, jurists, and judges in place to also protect the liberties of the people.
Edit: My comment isn't meant to diminish the huge role being played by other countries around the world.  It just so happens that the U.S. is currently ground-zero for Bitcoin based on available measurable metrics.

This strikes me as nonsense.  True, the fraudsters can continue to use credit cards, and the cost for chargeback fraud can be reflected in the cost of the goods or services rendered using such payment method.  The natural end result is a stratification: discounts for those who purchase using bitcoin and surcharges for those who purchase using credit cards.  Each payment method has its advantages and the market will ultimately set the price of the transaction.

You are misconstruing my words and you fail to understand the underlying economics.  Merchants do not stratify the costs away.  Rather, the market will stratify the costs and allocate them accordingly to the various types of transactions.  I predict that companies the likes of Overstock will be one of the first to bend to the will of the marketplace, and others will follow, until it will be uncompetitive not to do so.  That those who prefer to use Bitcoin may be subsidizing those who prefer to use credit cards and wish to have the ability to chargeback, does not mean that it will always be that way.

Fair points here.  Although declaring Bitcoin "not money" would have wide implications elsewhere, which they might not want to do.  Maybe they could narrowly declare Bitcoin "not money" relative to what they meant by "money" in Citizens United, which is probably what they would do if they were hell-bent on stamping out Bitcoin.
The "just sending data" is an interesting counter-argument.  Also, even at a more basic level, it is just a ledger that gets updated with numbers.  Isn't posting a ledger on the Internet free speech as well?
As far as restricting free speech for the reasons you mentioned, that might be an approach they take.  But consider that there are myriad legal uses for Bitcoin, so outright banning Bitcoin would be an overbroad restriction on free speech, one would think.
I kind of think this won't even play out in the courts because the Bitcoin will become so ingrained in the new economy that nobody, including politicians and jurists, will have the stomach to rip it out of the economy.

Nobody is forcing you or anybody else to use bitcoin for a transaction.  Ultimately, pricing set by merchants will reflect the true cost of a transaction.  Given the pervasive chargeback fraud problem, making a purchase with a credit card will cost more.  Some consumers will prefer that, and that is perfectly acceptable.  Other consumers prefer a cash-like transaction, and that is okay too.  It is not a "suck it" model, it is simply free market forces at work, whether you like it or not.

This question is probably contemplated by all at one point or another when considering Bitcoin and its implications on the U.S. and the world.  The problem as I see it is what would they ban?  Math?  A string of numbers?  Can the U.S. government prohibit me from storing a pass phrase in my mind if that is the only place in the universe where my bitcoins exist?  What would the statute say?  How would it be worded?  Laws in the U.S. require descriptive language that can withstand court challenges.  Simply saying: "Bitcoin is banned" in the statute would be a joke, at least in the U.S.  Maybe that would fly in North Korea.  My point is, in liberal western civilizations, freedoms are a way of life.  The people and companies invested in the new economy will not take such government actions sitting down.  They would fight it to the U.S. Supreme Court and likely win.  Nothing in the U.S. constitution (the highest law of the land) prohibits Bitcoin.  To the contrary, the U.S. constitution primarily places limits on what the government can do.

Are not as good as Bitcoin deals.


I've never had a credit card that gave extended warranties.  I've had plenty of merchants try to upsell me on them though.  I'm not saying this isn't possible, just doesn't seem so common with your typical card.


See above


Non-existent with Circle


Spread is quite small, and getting smaller with time (and will continue to get smaller... if you have experience in FOREX, you will understand).

Great job on the debate.  One point you made could be clarified.  You mentioned something to the effect that e-currencies are illegal under the U.S. constitution.  In actuality, the U.S. constitution doesn't ban e-currencies including bitcoin.  Rather, it bans *states* from making anything but gold and silver as tender in payment of debts (in other words, states can mint money, but it must be gold or silver).  It also bans counterfeiting.  Bitcoin is not counterfeit money because it does not have a likeness to the U.S. dollar.  In short, nothing in the U.S. constitution bans private individuals from creating private money.

No need to trust ghash.  At the moment, miners are okay with using ghash even up to the precipice because they offer a superior pool in many ways.  In the not-too-distant future, you will have better pool competition, which will disperse the miners more evenly.  Even if ghash had ulterior motives, the community as a whole would not let a 51% attack do much damage, if any.  Relax bankerfrombtc--you must admit, your life would be much more dull without Bitcoin.

That it is decentralized, private, and individually controllable.  
But the coolest use case for me currently is the availability of discounts.  Purchasing gift cards through egifter, where you can specify an exact amount, earn 3+ points (7 points on Black Friday), and combined with ebates save 10%+ on top of existing online discounts, you can literally pay less for goods and some services than 99% of the world population.
@_date: 2015-01-28 07:16:30


I disagree.  There are good reasons--although not widely known even among the community.  The one that even the average Joe can identify with is: **access to discounts**.  Using bitcoin with egifter you can enter the exact amount for the gift card, get 3+ points (7 points on Black Friday), and combined with ebates, save 10% on top of existing online discounts. Forget about getting 1 or 2 points using a credit card. Plus you are supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem. I have no affiliation with egifter or ebates: just a happy user.

The single biggest challenge right now holding this kind of development back is the price volatility.  When you earn very little, like the majority of those in Africa, you don't want to speculate with your money--you want stability.  
That said, I predict that Bitcoin will catch on Africa in a very big way.  Just not in the very near term.  
First, the Bitcoin market capitalization needs to increase from its current $6 billion to hundreds of billions, or more.  When that happens, and it could happen sooner than people realize, then the price volatility will subside, and many interesting possibilities then open up for this new and interesting economic phenomena.

For me personally, Bitcoin has evolved over time into a store of value like digital gold more than a transaction payment system (although I still do occasionally transact when it makes sense, such as for donating online).  Now more than ever, Bitcoin provides a secure feeling of personal financial sovereignty.  I am in complete control of my financial destiny.

I disagree.  In response to the overreach of the U.S. government post-911, nearly all HTTP traffic is now encrypted.  Prior to 911, nearly none of it was.  Modern smart phones with iOS 7 or higher cannot be brute-forced by the FBI, and Apple stands on principal when refusing to create a back door for the gov.  Encrypted email services such as [protonmail.ch]( are seeing broad adoption.  Encrypted VPN services are becoming ubiquitous.  zk-Snarks and other privacy-enhancing tech is on the verge of being adopted across blockchain projects.  Power back to the people--from the powerful to the powerless.  The future is bright.

I'm a huge fan of LN.  But unfortunately we will be stuck with pretty high fees for the foreseeable future until LN implementations gain traction--unless of course segwit2x provides some temporary reprieve from high fees (which I hope happens).

It is a good place to start when getting your first bitcoin.  But don't leave your bitcoin on Coinbase or any exchange long-term.  Get it onto a wallet on your phone (breadwallet recommended) or a hardware wallet such as a Trezor.  Don't trust anybody but yourself with your bitcoin.

Covert ASIC Boost is no longer an issue--why is author dwelling on it?  It's done.  Over with.  Segwit put that nail in the coffin.  And good thing too because it was unfair for other miners.
Segwit2x also prevents ASIC Boost.  So criticizing segwit2x on the basis of ASIC Boost is misleading.

I support segwit over BCH, and therefore support segwit2x.

I'm very confident that Core could put together a reliable 2X upgrade and deploy it before the NYA 2X update takes place.  Bitcoin has had political overtones since its inception.  To entirely ignore those I think is a mistake.

I guess I'm being somewhat repetitive because that is how it is, at least from my frame of reference, which is as a long-time Bitcoiner.
Edit: I will say this: I agree with you that miners don't want lower fees.  But isn't it instructive that they still support segwit2x?  The reason is because they know the market expects segwit2x, and that there will be price support if broadly adopted.
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:38:49
True, although individual U.S. states generally disagree (they say Bitcoin is at least money).  So far, courts in the U.S. have had a mixed treatment: some say it is money and others say it isn't.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:54:45
And it will remain as much.  Segwit2x does nothing to take away that individual sovereignty, which is important to me, yet I support segwit2x because I'm also a pragmatist.

2x will be considered BTC by most exchanges, miners, and users, so I don't really see a problem here.
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:36:52
Having won the most important battle (getting miners to adopt segwit), users are by and large ready (I believe) to compromise and throw their lot in with segwit2x to 1) put BCH out of its misery, 2) lower fees until Lightning implementations can take hold, and 3) join the consensus that is already formed between the miners and economic nodes to avoid a contentious split.
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:34:18
You must have access to a super secret BTC blockchain then, because the average fee for a transaction having a median transaction size right now is about 31,600 satoshis, and if you want a first confirmation faster than ~30 minutes, you'll be paying more.  And its going to get worse as LN implementation timelines slip.
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:54:07
Just like ETC right?
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:01:22
As a Chinese low-level regulator, you:
1) short BTC
2) announce some kind of action, rule, or onsite visit to a prominent exchange
3) buy BTC
4) profit
5) rinse and repeat
This pattern seems to repeat about every six months or so, has become quite predictable, and will likely continue.  But it becomes a little harder each time as the public becomes hardened to the tactic.

Greed keeps Bitcoin honest.
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:51:15
It's all upside in my mind.  It buys time for Lightning implementations and side-chains to build out their ecosystem.  It brings immediate relief to fees, which are killing users.  It impedes any further traction of BCH.  And it brings the community together into a full consensus (minus a few Core stragglers).  
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:34:14
Since when is a (in this case relatively simple) hard fork shock and awe?  Is that not using hyperbole perhaps inappropriately?  ETH has far more complex hard forks relatively frequently, and the community simply updates their software.   
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:07:39
I appreciate your candid reply.  Why doesn't Core prepare its own 2X with the replay protection and deploy it before the NYA 2X?
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:36:34
LN does not create middlemen for which trust is required.  The "middlemen" of LN also extract a minuscule fee compared to the legacy middlemen like credit card companies.  With LN, you still get decentralized, censorship-resistant, secure transactions.  LN scales Bitcoin without significantly increasing energy usage.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:17:30
segwit2x has broad support by everyone but Core.  Core is clearly opposed to it, inexplicably.  I tend to think of it as herd mentality, which is sad given that some of these are pretty bright bulbs.

Capital gains taxes impose an undue tracking burden on citizenry.

Still against it.  Always have been.  Check my history.  I've been a enthusiast for years.  I've always thought the BCH movement/approach was wrongheaded.  As a former industrial miner, I was particularly outspoken about their refusal to address ASIC Boost, which hurt many miners in Europe and America, putting many of them out of business.

Users generally want segwit2x--that is my gut instinct.  Who doesn't want lower fees while still maintaining sufficient decentralization, and with segwit and all of the added features to boot?
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:10:18
You're being unnecessarily hyperbolic.  The block size will be under 2MB at first and gradually grow with time, yes potentially reaching 8MB.  Which as a one-time increase, is well worth it, because it gives temporary reprieve to high fees, while maintaining sufficient decentralization, and lays the groundwork for successful second layer implementations.  It is the pragmatic approach that the market expects.
@_date: 2019-03-29 05:50:32
What it really does is make shorting an asset a bit trickier.  And the CMEsters love to short.  Thus, a problem.
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:27:51
So fees measured in dollars per transaction are low to you?  It isn't acceptable to most users.  You're going to drive them away (in fact, look at Bitcoin's share of crypto--it is has already happened, and will get worse absent a solution to high fees in the short term).
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:25:11


Well, you can always just peruse my history and see for yourself.  I battled more buttcoiners than you can probably fathom.  Most of those accounts are now dormant (as I checked up on them about a year ago).  Not too surprising as they were all probably bank shills, and once they realized Bitcoin wasn't going away, they gave up.




We are concerned because we support (and own) Bitcoin and want it to succeed.
 


The question is: which is the honey badger, no?


I'm afraid if segwit 1 MB blocks end up being Bitcoin, the flippening will happen.


I'll admit, the outcome is uncertain.  I'm just expressing my opinion and my view of what I think is best for Bitcoin, as a user.

The services don't want high fees.  They want segwit, a temporary reprieve from fees (segwit2x), and lightning network implementations long term.  And users want all of that too, and so do miners!  It is quite simple.

Probably hanging out with all of the other trolls from about the same era.  Loved having a good squabble in the "early" days of Bitcoin in 2013.  The big topics back then were "oh, you will lose all your coins" (no hardware wallets or good phone wallets at the time), "oh, just wait it will be made illegal" (still waiting), or "oh, tulips, tulips, etc." (just a lame comparison from the get-go).

Correct, it decided segwit over bcash (thankfully, as I've been fighting for segwit and against bcash for quite awhile).  I also believe the market is pricing in segwit2x, and if it doesn't happen, then look to the flippening, because the fees with Bitcoin will drop its overall crypto take from ~45% to something less, maybe much less.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:41:06
Great post, although I would argue that most users are for segwit2x.  Because it lowers fees in the short term (until LN implementations can take hold), while still maintaining sufficient decentralization.

This user, yes.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:14:04
If Core doesn't come around to the broader consensus, Bitcoin will lose its highest market cap position, and much of its utility.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:09:55
The users want a temporary reprieve from fees, while LN can take hold.  The economic nodes want it.  The miners want it.  We want segwit AND this reasonable compromise.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:22:23
I've always appreciated the work Core has done for the community, but why the visceral opposition to 2X?  It seems to me like Core is the lone holdout.
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:22:29
The market, I believe, is surging because it is pricing in segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:49:21
I agree tough to measure.  As a long-time Bitcoiner, it is intuition-based for me, although I could be wrong.  As I see it, segwit2x would benefit users.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:35:37
Okay boy.  But I disagree.  The 2X upgrade has been discussed for years.  It is a simple software update.  It provides immediate fee relief while 2nd layer implementations like LN take take hold, and it dampens enthusiasm for Bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:39:06
I think the NYA side of the community would converge on Core's 2X version, and Bcash would become a distance memory.  Of course, anything is possible.
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:49:22
You seem fairly confident that I'm not a user.  LOL.  As if you have any way to know that one way or the other.  And you don't think I support segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:29:02
I think the community supports segwit2x (I certainly do).  Because by and large we want to impede BCH and reduce confusion, while still maintaining sufficient decentralization.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:25:14
I'm not sure calling those of us longtime Bitcoiners who support the 2X update "bad actors" is very helpful.  Why the harshness?  We simply want what we think is best for Bitcoin and the ecosystem.

Bitcoin is hard money.  That is why it is tough to get.  Buying hard money with soft money means there is an imbalance in the transaction.  But rest assured, it is MUCH easier to acquire Bitcoin today than it was when I got started several years ago.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:20:52
Here's the thing: segwit2x is going to happen.  &gt;90% of miners and nearly all economic nodes have vowed to support it.  So regardless of you feel, that it shouldn't happen, it is going to happen.  And so the prudent thing to do for Bitcoin would be to join that consensus that has already formed.
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:47:41
Bcash isn't gaining traction because 1) there is little infrastructure and network effect for bcash--they are just getting started, and 2) the market prefers segwit (for a variety of reasons), and probably segwit2x as well.  Time will tell.  I'm fairly good at intuiting what is happening in this space, but I'm sometimes wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:29:25
Perhaps not, but they are beholden to their own self-interests.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:02:30
Perhaps Core should intuit more the present situation and build their own 2x implementation for release in the short term.  But they won't, so next best thing is segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:15:59
ETC isn't called Ethereum.  It is called Ethereum Classic.  I think the situation will be similar here.  But again, who knows.  Bcash is currently surging, and maybe most hashing power will simply switch to that, which I think is a shame, because I'm a big supporter of segwit.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:38:08
That is literally insane.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:31:40
The "governments will make it illegal" notion has been floating around since Bitcoin's inception.  So, now going on 8 years, and still, here we are.  There is a simple reason for this.  Most governments have already looked into banning Bitcoin, and all have forthwith backed away from that idea.  It is because such a ban would be impossible to enforce.  And so banning Bitcoin, and being unable to enforce such a ban, would make governments appear weak.  And governments don't like appearing weak.  
Therefore, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will never be outright banned.  What they will do is regulate the points at which crypto is exchanged for fiat (i.e., at the exchanges).  But that is an ephemeral victory, because exchange technology itself is quickly moving toward that of a decentralized nature.

@_date: 2016-11-19 01:41:11
If you are in the 10% or 15% tax brackets, you don't have to pay any long term capital gains taxes.  And if you bought bitcoin and immediately used them to purchase something, there is no short term capital gain or loss, and thus, nothing to report.  If you bought bitcoin and held, there is no capital gain or loss (until you sell them), and therefore, nothing to report.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:31:31
Not a bad reply.  Just want to point something out to you: your pompousness about being on the mailing list and everyone else is clueless is what turns many users off from Core's positions.  There is definitely a "holier than thou" attitude among your ranks.  You best solve that problem if you want to persuade the community over to your ways of thinking.  Users aren't stupid.  They know what they want.

segwit2x will happen.  It will be a combination of users, miners, and economic nodes that will ultimately determine what Bitcoin is.  That might be segwit.  Or it might be segwit2x.

I respectfully disagree.  Going to 2x is a rational compromise, will put BCH out of its misery, and will still maintain sufficient decentralization.
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:39:44
Those may be factors.  But in reality, ETH is not a security as things stand today.  The SEC has acknowledged that classifications can change over time.  Once a platform reaches a sufficient level of decentralization, many of the concerns such as information asymmetry go away, and there are fewer reasons to attempt to classify as a security.  If ETH was a security at some point (which is highly disputed, with this sub saying it was and the other sub saying it never was), what is important is that **it is not a security today**.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:20:54
Can't stop can you?  :)
You still don't understand the notion of cost per transaction do you?  Any damage caused by Bitcoin mining is minuscule compared to the amount of carbon thrown up by the massive world-wide banking apparatus, all of its sky scrapers, armored vehicles, physical gold.  Speaking of gold, the mining of gold alone is far more destructive to the environment than Bitcoin mining.  Our species can afford at least one POW chain.  Ethereum goes to POS within the next year or so.

This is the correct approach in crypto.  When the boards wail in grief, buy.  Those who can turn off their emotions win in this space--mostly long-term hodlers.  It isn't easy to hodl.  It is extremely hard.  Deny those emotions and do it.

@_date: 2018-06-19 17:07:54
They wouldn't.  Because all they would do is control the chain for at most a few blocks, and then they would have to pull off a double spend, which is hard because exchanges are getting much better mounting a defense to double spends (i.e., by requiring a higher number of block confirmations).  Once the rest of the network realized that the chain is under attack, the attacker would be forked off.  So, best case, they MIGHT be able to control the chains for a few blocks and MIGHT be able to carry out a double-spend.

No, not really.  Most mining consumes otherwise unused hydro power.  70%+ of energy used to mine crypto is from renewable sources.  On top of that, there is greater utilization of otherwise wasted natural gas from oil fields of the U.S.--capitalizing on this and actually using the natural gas for something is providing jobs and more working capital.  Bitcoin mining will drive improvements in renewal energy, just as it has spurred improvements in semiconductor tech.


And which market isn't?


Can you be more specific?


Please provide a citation to the law that it is breaking.


All wash trading does is inflate volumes.  Some exchanges do this so that they can get into the top listed exchanges.  The crypto field has identified these exchanges and have now excluded them when calculating volumes.  The SEC gets hung up on this too, but those pursuing ETFs have been trying to educate the SEC.  SEC may never come around, but reputable exchanges police for wash trading.


Bitcoin is the best performing asset over the last 10 years.


There is no such thing as inherent value, except for maybe food and shelter.  All value is assigned by humans.


So printing money like there is no tomorrow is fundamentally sound?


Crypto is unlikely to replace fiat.  They will both exist in parallel systems for decades or centuries to come.  Those with some smarts will use crypto, and those without smarts, will stick to fiat.


This is a short term problem.  Lightning Network on the horizon.


The currencies of choice for criminals and terrorists are the U.S. dollar and the Euro.


"Real" is in the eye of the beholder.
Anyhow, not sure why these points would make you HATE Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin stirs up hatred in you, it is probably because you subconsciously recognize its significance, and the cognitive dissonance is kind of niggly.

You will have complete ownership, security, and control of your BTC, while still being able to safely and conveniently transact with it.  Only buy from the source.

There is no "unregistered wallet" flag in the protocol.  This would not prevent commerce.  Sure, they could try to gum things up by imposing rules onto businesses, but the free world is pretty supportive of open, capitalistic, commerce, and it is unlikely that it would be tolerated for long.  And commerce is only one aspect of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is an inflation-resistant, confiscation-resistant, store of value.  All in all, I think the chances of governments in the free world attempting to kill off Bitcoin by stifling it are quite small.

Not so sure about that.  The communist Chinese gov is doing everything they can to suppress decentralized crypto trading.  Their efforts have been largely futile given that crypto can be traded peer-to-peer.  Perhaps they are slowly coming to a realization that it is here to forever stay, but perhaps not.  They do have some kind of complex that they are masters of the universe and can bend reality to their will--but decentralized crypto is going to challenge that notion considerably.  They may at some point in the future raise the flag of truce and join in, but I don't think that day is yet here, despite Xi's recent comments about embracing blockchain technology.

Well, I can see you have accumulated some of the top FUD points since you began your crypto sojourn.
1. Could someone just try bruteforcing private keys? Wouldn’t you find someone’s private key by doing that for a long period of time eventually?
\&gt;&gt;&gt; It would take the heat death of the universe to brute force your private key, assuming you did not use a weak random key generator.
2. Doesn’t a currency NEED inflation to work (I assume bitcoin to be “inflation-proof”)? Wouldn’t that mean that BTC would just go to infinity eventually? Also, why would anyone ever sell his BTC then, if it just keeps increasing forever?
\&gt;&gt;&gt; Crypto will co-exist with fiat for decades or centuries to come.  Those who want to hold and use money that loses value guaranteed over the long term, they can choose fiat.  Those who want hold and use money that grows its value over the long term, they can use crypto.  People sell their BTC when it goes up in value, because people like buying things.
3.  Would miners shut down after rewards get too small, thus making a 51% Attack easier?
\&gt;&gt;&gt; The mining mechanism in Bitcoin automatically adjusts to price and mining difficultly.  Miner rewards will get smaller percentage-wise, but value-wise they will climb for the foreseeable future.  In the year 2140, the last bitcoin will be mined.  At that point, it is expected that the network will be self-sustaining with transaction fees.
4.  Why is it not a problem that every year more bitcoin are lost forever?
\&gt;&gt;&gt; Because that increases the value of bitcoin held by everyone else.  Bitcoin rewards people who take the time to learn how to safely and securely store and use it.
5. Why does this whole community feel like such a circlejerk? People acting like bitcoins success is inevitable (Maybe it is, idk).
\&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the community has a vast array of opinions.  Don't sense a circlejerk at all.
Also I feel like everyone saying, to not trust banks/the media/etc. is not better than them?
\&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct, don't trust banks and MSM.  They are not out for your good.
Should I ask these questions?
\&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.
Won’t time and progress eventually solve the problems and major concerns?
\&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, they always do.

Arguably, at the moment the bcash fork happened, users had control of the bcash because the private keys are the same.  And the value at that moment of creation was $0 and went up from there.

The fear of a government ban is the first criticism that most people bring up when introduced to the world of Bitcoin.  It has held back probably hundreds of thousands of people from discovering and participating in this new economy.  The fear is irrational and ultimately hurts regular people.  Those who propagate the fear are usually those who have something to lose.  It ain't going to happen, at least not in the free world.  Western liberal democracies will be content with taxing it.

Comparing crypto to a company is a fool's errand and a newb mistake.  Crypto isn't a company.  Crypto is comprised of open source decentralized software networks.  Attempting to apply a traditional valuation method is fool hardy.  You say: it won't ever become anything of value.  That is absurd and ridiculous and reveals your bent.  You misunderstand mining as well.  The LN will allow for thousands (perhaps hundreds of thousands) of transactions per second.  The cost per transaction is about to plummet on the Bitcoin network.  It is about to make the cost of a corrupt global banking apparatus look extremely expensive.
And yes, there are hundreds of use cases for crypto today.  Right now.  And yes, I use it every day.  Have a nice day.

You can think of Bitcoin presently as more akin to digital gold than to currency.  Studies have shown that when the price of bitcoin rises, hodlers tend to spend some.  This is similar to the wealth effect where people feel richer when the value of their home rises, and so spend more.  Add a few more trillion to the market cap of Bitcoin and it will begin to stabilize and function more like currency.  All it would take is a few national governments to decide to start treating bitcoin as a reserve currency.

Gold and grain markets are global and largely opaque.  Gold along with other metals markets are highly manipulated.

I don't know whether an ETF is going to be good or bad for Bitcoin, but I do think it is inevitable--not because Bitcoiners are pushing for it, but because traditional Wallstreet investors will be pushing for it.

We do have some historic examples where countries have lost monetary control and did not go to extreme measures.  One example is Ecuador, when they simply gave up on monetary control and switched to using dollars.  Still a functioning country.
I agree with you to some extent that IF the U.S. ever lost complete control of monetary policy, there would be some that began to panic.  The main concern, I think, would be how to continue taxing and spending.  My belief here is that most future taxes (when I say future, I mean like 30-50 years down the road) will be on real property, because it is physical and exists in the real world, is immovable, can't be obfuscated, and the constable can physically show up to collect if needed.  I believe that income taxes, capital gains, and sales taxes will eventually be phased out.  This is the new world we live in.  One where privacy is protected by cryptography, as well as money.  It would be extremely difficult to put cryptography back in the bag.  Those battles were fought in the 1990s.  It's done.   Writing on the wall.

There was a time (long ago) when [GHash.IO]( had &gt; 50% hash power of the network.  That was a low point in Bitcoin decentralization, and it has only been getting better since.  Legacy economists claim that Bitcoin mining is a natural monopoly.  Reality suggests otherwise.

This is what has been tried:
\-  link it to all the illicit things it’s been used for, then push that its main goal is to hurt the country and its people
\-  call it terrorism or treasonous
\-   Just say it’s bad
\-  show the times it’s been used for bad
\-  ignore every argument against you
We know at least those approaches have not worked.  I think you underestimate the rights protected under the 1st amendment of the B.O.R. of the U.S. Constitution.  The SCOTUS has already held that code is speech.  They've also held that money is speech in the Citizens United case.  Any attempts by the U.S. to ban use of crypto would be immediately challenged by multiple parties as a violation of constitutional rights--and the challengers would win.  Given that use will never be banned in the United States, it will unlikely ever be banned in the rest of the free world.  China?  Maybe, but I doubt even they would ever try to ban individual use, given that enforcement would be virtually impossible, unless you assign a police officer to look over the shoulder of every citizen of the country.

We know about it now.  And it explains why other miners (including me) were driven out of business over the years, thereby causing an overall consolidation and centralization of the network.  Am I upset to find out the likely reason behind it?  You bet I am.  It is an existential threat.  It might have gradually wreaked its havoc, but now that the community is aware of it, it ought to be prioritized at the top or near the top of things that need to be fixed.

I found this out the hard way, just like you have.  Over the years I've resorted to a very casual approach, such as just mentioning off the cuff that "Bitcoin and crypto are huge deals and I suggest you read up on them."  And I leave it at that.  Most people will not take your advice at first, but when they see the next big price surge being covered in the mainstream media, they will think to themselves "Oh, my friend \_\_\_\_ said that this is a big deal, maybe I should learn more on my own."  And so they begin the trek down the rabbit hole.  But--most importantly--they have to come to that realization themselves.  You are only the seed-planter.

@_date: 2018-11-07 21:15:32
I can observe that you have thought deeply about this issue, as have I, and I think our philosophies on the matter are not all that far apart.  I am in agreement that the modern tax code is mostly not about raising revenue--it is mostly about control.
That is why the shift to something like the Fair Tax has received a tremendous amount of resistance, because it largely takes control away from the state and gives it back to the people.  Detractors of the Fair Tax disingenuously (in my opinion) make the argument that people would simply go to Canada or Mexico to buy goods thereby bypassing the tax on new retail goods (since only new goods are taxed under the Fair Tax).  That is preposterous.  People aren't going to up and travel across a boarder just to buy some goods.  Nevertheless, that primary argument has impeded the Fair Tax movement.  I think the Fair Tax, even though it would empower the individual and unshackle the individual from the threat of state violence (i.e., imprisonment), it will never be able to muster the necessary support from the political class.
A pure tax on real property, on the other hand, removes the argument about crossing the border to avoid the tax.  It is simple.  It is enforceable.  There would be little tracking burden on the citizenry.  And it could support local as well as federal governments.  Will governments have less control over individuals?  Sure they will, and there will be resistance because of that, but at the end of day it will be their only truly viable choice, because cryptography and encryption are eventually going to fundamentally alter the balance of power between governments and individuals.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:27:09

@_date: 2018-11-02 03:25:01
These were the big battles of 2013 and 2014.  The trolls here were adamant about both.  What they would not concede is that even though governments might attempt bans, it will never be stopped.  The bans will simply make the governments appear weak and ineffectual (see China).  That is why most governments won't even try.  As for scarcity, there is only one Bitcoin network, and will only always be one Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2018-11-07 16:52:14
Again, not necessarily.  They will tax whatever they can.  Bitcoin and other crypto will be harder to tax and control, and therefore they will spend less effort on those.  Cryptography-based assets are a terrible target for governments: high effort and small payoff.  Property taxes are easy, they are physically there, and they can show up at your door if necessary.  Long term I see income and capital gains taxes giving way to taxes that are based purely on real assets, even if they have to tax those at super high rates.
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:26:08
Lending a cup of sugar would not fall within the Fair Tax because 1) it is not a sale, and 2) it is not the initial sale on a new item at the retail level.  Nevertheless, I do agree that the Fair Tax would be largely ineffective for the same reason that income and capital gains taxes will eventually become ineffective: because money is becoming disembodied from the physical, and money will eventually be entirely private/encrypted.  Thus, my postulation about real property being the last bastion of government taxation.

This is flat out wrong (at least for the U.S.).  There are laws in the U.S. against counterfeiting.  Bitcoin is not a counterfeit because it doesn't have the the likeness of the U.S. dollar.  The "Liberty" dollar was stopped on grounds it broke counterfeiting laws because it was a silver coin with an eagle on it and had the likeness of U.S. currency.

Why not?  The rate could be set at whatever was necessary.  You might argue that property owners would be upset about high real property rates, but there is nothing fundamentally preventing a government from deriving most if not all from taxes on real property.  It might also alleviate property owner concerns if they knew that their income and investments would not be taxed, and all of the concomitant, tedious record-keeping that goes along with income and capital gains taxes.  I'd happily trade all of the nightmarish record-keeping that supports income and capital gains taxes, and accept a single large tax bill on my real property.

His timing is never quite right, but I always appreciate his insights.  Dovetailing off of something he said, when the central banks lower interest rates and implement QE, some of that freshly printed fiat inevitably ends up into Bitcoin.  Expanding this thought a bit further, since Bitcoin is not taken into account for any of the inflation indexes used by central banks, the mere existence of Bitcoin makes it harder for central banks to meet their "target" 2% price inflation.  In other words, in a Bitcoin world, they will need to continue to lower rates and push QE if they ever want to hit that 2% target.  And even then, they may never get there (e.g., see Japan for last 20 years).

While I share some concern about this, the situation is not as dire as detractors make it out to be.  There is no single company that controls 51% of the hash power--not even close.  There are many well-funded upstarts in the Bitcoin mining business locating in colder climates around the world.  I remember the days when [Ghash.IO]( controlled &gt; 50% of hash power through their pool.  That was more of a concern to me than the present situation.

As LN takes hold, the number of transactions / watt expended will skyrocket.  In other words, the Bitcoin network is about to become very efficient.  Compared to the legacy banking system, energy use will be small.  Same with gold mining (which takes a massive amount of energy and really does tear up the Earth in not-so-great ways).  Bitcoin will also drive the development of more efficient and greener energy generation technologies.  Already, the Bitcoin network runs on 70%+ renewable energy.

FINCEN says otherwise.   [
And it was only ever Bitcoin amounts held in a foreign account that were even thought MIGHT fall under the FBAR requirements.  Even those don't need to be reported.  There was never ANY discussion about privately-held crypto--which of course would not even come close to the requirements under the FBAR.

You are correct in that I don't think Bitcoin needs an ETF.  But as I also said, there are many people who do need a Bitcoin ETF, because they are incapable or uncourageous to invest directly.  And so many people are being hurt by being prevented from participating in the new economic paradigm.

This is the largest barrier that I keep running into as well.  Usually, my approach now is to say something like: "hey, this is really important, and you should pay attention to what is happening," and leave it at that.

Just like China?  And do you believe those moves were effective?  Do you think that the Chinese enthusiasts all gave up and abandoned Bitcoin?  Do you really think that liberal western governments will model their behavior on actions taken by a communist government?
The U.S. congress could pass a law making possession of Bitcoin illegal--true (albeit highly unlikely).  Do you think that would be the final say?  Do you not think that such a law would be challenged on constitutional grounds by dozens or even hundreds of different parties?  Do you not think the first amendment protects my right to possess a string of letters and numbers?  And to exchange my string of letters and numbers for something else?

U.S. Appellate Courts have held that cryptography is protected speech.  Those battles played out in the 1990s, and the elements within the U.S. government that were attempting to stifle the spread of cryptography ultimately lost and backed down (and good thing, because we would not have the modern-day Internet as we know it had the government won).  They did not push it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court probably because they feared they would lose there too.  Bitcoin is cryptography.  My ownership of a random string of digits and numbers is protected by the 1st amendment (protected speech), the 4th amendment (privacy), the 5th amendment (takings of property), and ultimately, the 2nd amendment (right to bear arms).

Bitcoin is less volatile than some already existent ETFs.  It is less the volatility that Mr. Clayton has concerns over, and more about "manipulation" of the marketplaces.  That too is inconsistent given that other markets are just as manipulated or more so (as but one example of many: the recent arrest of JP Morgan/Chase traders for aggressively manipulating the gold market).  We are not getting the core reason for Jay Clayton's opposition.  I have my guesses on what the core reason is: but we aren't getting it publicly from Mr. Clayton.

Mr. Buffet has always been so publicly modest about his lack of knowledge regarding things of a highly technical nature.  He has always been the first to admit that he is unwilling to speak about or invest in areas that he does not understand.  
Until Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies--that is.  Even though these are of a highly technical nature and have many nuances in terms of their integration into society, Mr. Buffet nevertheless preaches from the pulpit so to speak about its dangers.  This is what has rubbed many in the crypto community the wrong way.  It isn't that he should not be respected for his investing prowess and historic humility--he should be and deserves that respect--it is that he sharply strayed from that when it came to Bitcoin and crypto.

This has been discussed extensively (just search for Trezor on Reddit).  But in short, the software and hardware are open source.  The Trezor uses two seeds, one from itself and one from the host computer, to generate private keys.  Hardware does what software tells it to do.  You can load verified software onto the Trezor.  Nobody has ever posted on Reddit that their Trezor was hacked, which is quite remarkable given the number of hack posts using other technologies.  The attack vectors are significantly reduced with a Trezor, and therefore, it is very secure.

Compromise is in the air.  It is the best for Bitcoin and all Bitcoiners, in my opinion.

Folks, I lean over but at my core, I'm just interested in seeing the Bitcoin experiment succeed (and of course, I'm personally invested in seeing it succeed).  Let's do the one-time block size enlargement, and move on.  BCC/ABC will whither away.  Lightning will be implemented on top of segwit.  There really is no good reason to obstruct the segwit2x compromise.  Let's just let it happen, and move on.  Bitcoin will ultimately be stronger in the end.
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:02:05
It doesn't have to be disastrous.  If the community wants to take ABC/BCC/BCH/BMC coin out of the picture, then support the 2x part of segwit.  Otherwise, confusion reigns and it will be bad.  And I'm a small blocker.
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:54:15

I've been a longtime afficianado, and still am.  I've been here since early 2013, battling what was then the big topic: buttcoiners.  Now we have segwit2x and the big question of whether the 2x part of it will go into effect, or whether BCC will otherwise gain a foothold.  I support segwit (always have) AND the 2x fork.  It is the only way to guarantee the demise of BCC or its progenitors.

It isn't a rush.  I've endured this stupid debate for years (as I'm sure you have as well).  I tend to see through the emotions on both sides and urge compromise.  Our entire community could use some healing, and I mean our *entire* community.  There is a time to fight, and we have won the most significant battles.

Yes, this is probably spot on.  Segwit2x is the compromise that will win the day for most miners, economic nodes, and users.  Butt hurt Jihan fans will fail with their BCC crap coin, and some Core developers will continue to be butt hurt over the doubling of the block size.  But the rest of us win.

Taxes on property can be made progressive based on assessed or market value.  For example, for those who own real estate worth less than $200,000, no tax.  Between $200,000 and $400,000, 15%.  Between $400,000 to $1,000,000, 25%.  Over $1,000,000, 35%.  The amount of tax could be set to any amount necessary to cover modern social safety net programs.

My primary argument is that of protected speech under the first amendment.  The fourth amendment might have some applicable overtones as well on the privacy front, but I would not hang my hat on that (whereas I'm very comfortable hanging my hat on the first amendment).  


Well, okay, we're kind of splitting hairs at this point.  Yes, I concede, one or two branches of government might try to prohibit bitcoin (although I find that possibility to be extremely low in the United States).  And yes, if they tried, they would ultimately fail, because of checks and balances, the constitution (highest law of the land), and the third branch of government (the judiciary).


I think we have found common ground of agreement on this point.


Again, they may try to pass a law to that effect, but I am confident that it would be struck down as well on constitutional grounds.  The SCOTUS has been consistent on holding that code and money are protected speech.

In my opinion, BCC won't survive if 2x succeeds.  I believe the segwit non2x chain might survive, but it will be like ETC.  There will be a single segwit Bitcoin chain for miners, economic nodes, and most users.  There will be a few users that stick with Bitcoin "classic."  So be it.  They'll probably need to change POW though to remain viable.  Segwit2x is the best bet for segwit.

This seems like a coordinated attempt between the U.S. justice department and the NY attorney general's office to disrupt the Bitcoin space.  First, the U.S. justice department freezes 800 million, probably thinking this would force Bitfinix into bankruptcy.  When that didn't happen, they probably tipped off the NY attorney general's office about the situation, and they pounced.  
Should the Bitfinix/Tether people have disclosed the loan that kept both operating to the public?  I think, yes, they should have.  But that doesn't take away from the fact that some within the U.S. government and NY state government attempted to set a trap to wipe out one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the world.

I think that they realized that things don't always remain the same, and that it was probably inevitable in one form or the other.  Had they tried to squelch Bitcoin in its infancy, another would have risen to fill its role.  The turning point was actually the advent of the Internet.  Once there was an open, decentralized permissionless network like the Internet in existence, then decentralized money was a natural evolution from that.  We are now at a point where the only real way to stop crypto is to turn the Internet OFF or take down the electrical grid.  Neither of those options are palatable, and so instead, governments will attempt to influence and regulate on the margins where they can (e.g., centralized exchanges).  Outright bans are absurd on their face (you mean I can't own and trade a random string of letters and digits?), and in the example we have where an authoritarian government attempted a ban (China), it has been largely ineffectual.  The reason is that enforcement of such a ban is nigh impossible.

If people could keep all that they earned, working and being successful would be incentivized instead of punished.  In addition, the heavy handed regime that we have now, which requires everyone to meticulously track every tiny detail of their lives and businesses would be replaced with a simple-to-understand and easy-to-enforce tax code.  People would be flush with money.  The higher taxes on the property would therefore be tolerable.  Property is something that everyone needs to survive (whether owned or rented), so the prices would not be significantly depressed, especially since everyone would have more money to begin with.  Few would move to another country because net-and-net their financial situation would be about the same.  The plan could be revenue neutral.  And people live in the United States because their friends and family are here, and it is a beautiful and secure country.

Considering that the position taken by one branch of the government that strong cryptography was to be considered a munition was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1990s as a violation of the 1st amendment of the Constitution, we have strong precedent that favors my position over yours.
Code itself and money are protected speech.  Owning and using random strings of digits and letters are protected speech.
The act of cracking DMCA encryption is not protected speech.  Also, note that in the DMCA case you linked to: "The issuers of a series of cease-and-desist letters claim that the key itself is therefore a copyright circumvention device."  In other words, copyright owners were the ones making the claim that the cracking key was an illegal number.

To the contrary, it is obviously true.  Sure there are "tons and tons" of laws, yet as an American, I have certain inalienable rights set forth in the Bill of Rights.  Any law that violates those rights is not a valid law and will eventually be struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.  We've already seen laws that prohibit the use of cryptography being struck down in this way.  That is because the U.S. Constitution is the highest law of the land.
The first amendment was carefully crafted by the nation's founders to protect some of the most sacrosanct rights, including that of freedom of speech.  If any law violates my freedom of speech, it has no lasting effect.  It is my constitutional right to own and use a random string of digits and letters, despite any laws to the contrary.

That is why no government will ever ban bitcoin.  They may try to cabin it and weight it down with regulation, but there will be no bans.

There will always be real property to tax.  Immovable, can't be obfuscated, and the constable can physically show up to collect if needed.  Long term, income and capital gains taxes will be faded out.  Property tax on real estate will become the primary means of taxation by governments.

Welcome back!  Your curation theory is very creative--I'd highly recommend it to the legislative branch of the U.S. government if they are ever trying to craft a law to ban crypto, because the theory does a great job in shifting and obfuscating the primary issue.  Rocks are not protected speech.  Alphanumeric strings are protected speech.  I agree with you that "they" could "forbid" it (they being Congress w/ signature by President) in an ill-conceived law, but that would not stop me and most others, even though I consider myself to be a law-abiding and tax-paying citizen.  The reason is because the law itself would be unconstitutional at its very inception.  I would rather see the constitution upheld.  You mentioned that you would be willing to become a martyr over this issue if it ever came down to it, and so would I.  If the matter ever made its way through the court systems to the SCOTUS, the law would be struck down, and I would be vindicated.
Another missive: when the government banned gold, the compliance was very low.  And again, this was among the middle to upper class of society, that would otherwise have thought themselves as law-abiding.  The message is: the government can try to go down the road of prohibition, but history shows that if the people want something, they will have it regardless of what some people in the government might want.

Property tax would be tied to the owner of the property.  Tenants would not directly pay any tax (although the tax would be "built in" to the cost of the rent).  Each property has an assessed and market price.  This is already done by most counties in the nation, so we know how to do that.  The progressive nature of the tax would be based on either assessed or market value (most likely assessed, since that is how non-progressive property taxes work presently, so it would be easy to adopt for a progressive property tax).  So for an owner of multiple properties, the tax bracket would be based on the aggregate value of all of the owner's properties.  Properties owned by pass-through entities would have the value of the properties "passed through" to the aggregate value of the owner's property, sort of like income gets passed through today.'
As for a real-world example, nearly half of the population today pays no federal income tax.  Since this would be a revenue-neutral plan, the property taxes would be low or non-existent for a household that today pays no federal income tax.  This can easily be managed by how the progressive property tax rates are set.  Again, people would net-and-net be in about the same financial situation as they are today.  The BIG benefits, however, include that the oppressive tracking requirements would be gone, tax compliance would be near 100% because evasion would be nigh impossible, nobody could obfuscate their tax obligations using cryptography, and work and success would be incentivized.

I don't know.  It could go either way.  I've thought about this for years (since early 2013 when I fell down the crypto rabbit hole).  I lean toward no (at least not by the United States).  The CIA started talking with Galvin Andresen (one of the early Bitcoin core devs) in 2011.  Had they wanted to kill the project, they would have done it then when it was small and vulnerable.  They didn't.  That suggests that after weighing the pros and cons of a technology that empowers individuals like never before, they felt that the pros outweighed the cons.  And here we are today, nearly 10 years later, and the suggestion of stopping or outlawing crypto is now laughable, as demonstrated by the vast and varied responses to Rep. Sherman's latest musings.

Not weird at all.  Democratization itself is a form of decentralization.  If you observe the authoritarian regimes of today such as China, what is their stance on decentralized crypto?  Do they welcome it and foster the winds of decentralization?  Of course not, because control.  A world without crypto is a hobbsian one -- a world of strongmen, and winner take all - it is brutal, not a liberal Paradise.  Anarchy is bad, but tyranny is worse.  And crypto doesn't bring anarchy.  It simply enables additional freedoms from tyranny.

First principal to understand is that governments might try to ban crypto, but they can't stop it.  Second principal to understand is that if U.S. lawmakers ever tried to ban crypto, such laws would be immediately challenged by multiple parties as a violation of the 1st amendment of the U.S. constitution.  And the challengers would win.   The Supreme Court of the United States has already held that code and money are protected speech.

Maybe yes, but I think if this issue ever is put before SCOTUS, you will see a very pedantic analysis.
 


Kindred spirit.






Here I disagree.  A string of digits and letters can be purely random and still represent a thing.  In this case, a crypto token.


I don't agree with your if-purely-random -&gt; not property.  Why can't a purely random string also be property?  I am the only person in the universe with this particular combination of digits and numbers.  It is my property.  It is mine.  I control it 100%.  


Those battles were fought in the '90s, and the government lost.  Cryptography, once out of the bag, can't be put back into it.  It's like trying to put toothpaste back into the tube.  Or the baby back into the womb.  Etc.

You can exchange your mined bitcoin for your local currency.  Coinbase works great if you are in the United States.  Every country will have various bitcoin exchanges that you can use.

I love the author's humility in the disclaimer, but the implicit suggestion that you must be a physicist or an economist to understand things of this nature seems like a stretch.  While Bitcoin is somewhat complex and may seem initially hard to grasp, it isn't quantum mechanics-like hard.  I believe that any sane person with average competence can understand enough about Bitcoin to obtain some and transact in some.  He or she may not know everything about it, but enough.
The challenge for the average person, without some basic level of technical know-how, is to safeguard their Bitcoin.  If and when the Bitcoin ecosystem makes it easier to safeguard Bitcoin, watch out, because that is when it will go mainstream, and the sky will be the limit.

You articulate so well my love of physical coins.  I've collected them for years.  I too hope to pass them down to my children, and hope they will eventually do the same, through multiple generations.  Theoretically, they can last forever.
Notice that I qualified my statement that *in some ways*, Bitcoin collecting is greater.  I suppose collecting is probably not the proper term to apply to Bitcoin... perhaps accumulating is the better word?  The accumulation of bitcoin can be quite enjoyable and sometimes even exhilarating.  Mining for bitcoin offers a unique, and for some, educational hobby.  For others, somewhat unbelievably, it is their livelihood.
I agree that the comparison made in my original post is somewhat remote--but nevertheless pertinent.  At some fundamental level they are alike: they both represent value, however that value is defined or appreciated, be it wholesome and sentimental value, monetary value, historical value, etc.
