Alright, if you don't think Finway's nonsense comment warranted that recommendation then I won't argue.
Anyways, what about vendors? I don't see why they would want to expose themselves to the same risk- on an even greater scale.

Doesn't matter if the market is up or down, it shouldn't be a fucking gamble to get some BTC and buy something. Since I'm not an idiot speculator, this is undesired.
And nobody is talking about the amount of time it takes to claim a purchase at a set price. It's the amount of time before you have BTC in hand, ready to pay for something. Plenty of p2p exchange services take this long before you have BTC in your wallet.

Way to miss the point. Also, open a fucking economics book.

Again, I have no idea what the fuck you are on about.

What the fuck are you on about?

Basic macro/microeconomics. I know Ron Paul told you all about the Fed and Keynesian economics, but maybe you should brush up on the basics before you start shitting dim-witted sentences all over the internet.

SEPA transfer to private seller through exchange service, 1-2 days, seller confirms payment received, exchange site releases coins, transfer coins to wallet. Not the only way to do it- but it's one way that can take 3-4 days.
