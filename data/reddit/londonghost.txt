You are completely wrong. All you have is a collection of, in itself worthless, private keys.  
What gives bitcoin value are bitcoin buyers, ie. people who are willing to transfer actual wealth in exchange for bitcoins.

No, actually Billon *appears* to be a true digital cash, ala [Chaum's ecash]( Use doesn't require identification! Yes, no kyc/aml.  
In addition to online mode, it supports offline transfers, supposedly for transfers between friends (as they can't really be secured). Basically the equivalent of giving somebody a private key to a bitcoin address.  
The problem is that the actual algorithm isn't explained anywhere, nor is the application open source. So verifying how it all works is harder. However, if what they appear to claim is really true, this is bitcoin killer. 
There are some silly law-required transaction limits over which the application freezes your funds and requires you to identify, but if their claims about transaction anonymity are true (all of which are technically possible), these limits are enforced by *local code only* which makes them trivial to break.

Technically yes, but being a hodler usually has a more long-term meaning. Even in that short period of time, their bitcoins only have value because of future buyers, not past ones.

Having *management* experience while young is almost impossible, unless the person in question already (co)created a startup. Which makes it an absurd requirement.     


Nobody cares about resumés. A startup is not a job. In fact young people with no experience are seen more positively than older ones with standard corporate work experience. No experience means you're an unknown quantity and could be great. Working a few years makes you a more known quantity - a worker, someone who is used to following an externally imposed structure.

Because the impact was minor. Even unemployment peaked at a  very small level - at about 10%. That's a relatively big result in America, but objectively, it's very small. There are many countries which have higher unemployment perpetually.  


The point? Do you really believe that? That the bankers sat somewhere, one of them said "If we do this bailout, the poor will benefit less than the rich!" and they all laughed maniacally?  


Nothing like that happened. The alternative would be much worse for everyone. Excepting the preppers perhaps.

Billionaires don't have 'mountains of dollars'. They own things that are worth mountains of dollars. 
Your fantasy scenario of making billionaires poor requires a socialist revolution and nationalization of their wealth. Sometimes I'm not sure but I think that's not exactly the goal of bitcoin users...

Moderate inflation is only a tax when coupled with an income tax, because income tax is nominal. So coupled with inflation, income tax becomes a wealth tax.  
Without income tax, even double digit inflation wouldn't result in any noticeable transfer of wealth to the government. That's because (a) base money is a very small fraction of total wealth and (b) people anticipate inflation.  
I have an unlikely conspiracy theory that anti-inflation stance was popularized partially to capture and discredit opposition to the income tax.

This proves the exact opposite of what you think it does. This proves that almost nobody actually needs gold. It's just a pure speculation vehicle at this point, a bubble.  
Were the leverage to stop, the gold market would crash to really low prices.

Yes, along with everyone's else. Without bailouts America would become what is Greece today. There would be no money to cover deposits of individuals and businesses.  
When banks lose money it means there's no money for depositors.  
Also, it was a liquidity problem, not a solvency problem. [The federal government actually made money on the financial bailout](

Completely wrong. How do you think this hole was found? By reverse engineering.  
Symbols are available for everything and there's no obfuscation, which makes it very easy. C decompilation is almost perfect today and in most cases produces compilable code.   
For low-level languages like C, opening the source has no impact on bug/backdoor detection.  
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:59:49


Who is we?  


Only if you define 'arbitrary elites' as 'old people' and to a much lesser extent those on welfare. The biggest generational debt by far is for pensions and healthcare of old people.  
[The majority of American federal budget is spent on welfare]( In Europe this is even worse due a to much smaller military budgets and bigger welfare.  
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:06:40


America is clearly not insolvent. The only way it can go bankrupt is by an exceptional act of government insanity (like Russia did in 1998). That's because America's debt is in dollars.  
[Majority of government debt is owned by the government itself]( So the real debt is much smaller than official statistics.  
 


It's not possible to transport goods from the future and America is way too big to function on external debts (like Greece). Which means that the current economy is sustainable.  
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:17:10


You can declare bankruptcy today and the outcome is going to be much better. Without bailouts there would be a great depression and living standards would fall from a cliff.  


In what magical land? The whole problem with banking crisis is that productive businesses default because money flow stops. This is happening in Greece this very moment.  
Which means that real output of the economy drops.  
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:45:21


Nothing like that happened, the output fell by 0.92% in 2008 and that's it.  
During Great Depression American output was cut in half.  
Today the outcome would be much worse, because the economy is more reliant on the financial system.   
War often follows collapses of this magnitude.   


The major difference between Greece and America is that America can create dollars and bailout its financial sector.  
You're arguing against that.  
@_date: 2015-07-13 08:54:04
Yes, there's some transfer as money flows from the source.  
[American wealth $83.708 trillion](  
[2014 Monetary base - ~$4 trillion](  
So, in the simplest model of an unbelievably dumb market in a equilibrium, even with current abnormally low velocity of money doubling the base money and spending it would transfer $2 trillion (in pre-inflation purchasing power) to the government, while causing 100% inflation. $2 trillion because first spent dollar sees old prices, but last spent dollar sees prices 2x higher, so the average price is 50% higher.  
 
(incidentally $2 trillion is 50% of the federal budget for 2015).  
As that would reprice everything (on average) 2x higher, with 25% income tax the government would capture $10463,5 billion + $2000 billion = $12.4 trillion (pre-inflation money). Not instantly, but eventually everything will be transacted.  
In reality people aren't dumb and wealth transfer from buying with new money is going to be much, much smaller, but evading the effect of inflation on income tax is called tax evasion.  
Additionally, current velocity of money is about 2x lower than it was before crisis (ie. the fed has effectively piles of yet unspent money). So if the real wealth transfer from inflation is 10% of a dumb market, **the wealth transfer due to income tax resulting from inflation is ~100x that from inflation alone**.

It's not going to be the end of the world.  
The demand is already here, created by bitcoin, but not exclusive to it. When bitcoin becomes unusable people will just switch to some other crypto, probably one that currently doesn't exist.  
Current ridiculous blocksize debate showed that improving bitcoin is almost impossible, and what can't change, dies.  
Ridiculous because the 'problems' with big blocks could be summarized as: "I live in Afghanistan earning $10/month as a goat herder. I got a mortgage to buy a pc to run a full bitcoin node on a stolen wifi from nearby American base. I can't work with bigger blocks therefore they're an evil centralization".

If you're paying someone within the same bank you're just transferring the IOU's ownership, but if you transfer money somewhere else you're redeeming IOU.  
I don't think the first case is that important in practice, there are way too many banks in the world. Also in most countries government forces banks to keep some minimum reserves.

News at 11: banks work the way everyone knows they work.  
No, they don't create money individually. "Money" in a bank account is not money, it's a check written by the bank. Everyone can, physically, write a check with any number, no matter if he has the money. That doesn't mean that everyone can create money out of nothing, the check will bounce if its too big...
If we follow the author's faulty logic and reproduce the experiment with a homeless person (keeping balances in a notebook), it would 'prove' that he can create money out of nothing.  
It's called fractional reserve system because banks have to keep some reserves to be able to cash the checks (on-demand deposits). These reserves only decrease when money is transferred out of the bank, although it's complicated in practice by the fact that it's possible to sell the debt or use it as a collateral with a third party.     
What the author calls "credit creation theory", "fractional reserve theory" and "financial intermediation theory" are in fact the descriptions of the same thing, but from the point of view of an individual bank, the banking system and the economy, respectively. They are not contradictory, even if they may appear so on the surface.    
The letter of confirmation of facts by Raiffeisenbank Wildenberg is funny, as all it proves it that this micro bank doesn't even understand how its IT system work, which they must have bought from someone. If there really aren't any checks, why don't they issue millions of euros to themselves and live in luxury?... 
How would it be physically possible for a bank to get bankrupt if they could really create money?

That's like saying that every king in history of the world was oppressive, which is obviously not true. Even feudalism didn't start as an oppressive system. It started as a genuine protection mechanism against bandits and similar, for the price of a small protection payment.  
In fact, being oppressive is counterproductive. It's way more profitable to tax the citizens at some small level and provide the foundations for productive economy (police and courts).  
Dictatorship is the only type of government where freedom can exist, precisely because of 'OBEY OR ELSE'. Freedom just doesn't work in democracy - most of current totalitarian regulations are in fact supported by the majority of respective populations, like drug laws. When the support for some particular thing starts to disappear, you get stuff like current American wave of marijuana legalization.  
For a common type of person, good in nothing in particular, with no real interest or motivation in life, the only fleeting feeling of power comes from identifying with the state as it crushes other people.

I assume by 'no fees' you really mean they are hidden in the spread... otherwise you wouldn't make any money (or your third parties).

How is that related to hiding money flows? Only a completely dumb dictators would hide these transfers. If they do, it becomes a secret that their cronies can use against them, in a power bid. Make a big show of how the state is investing in some bullshit, like better technology or weapons that will make everything better.

If somebody questions it too much call them unpatriotic and fuck up their life to the applause of the crowds.

No, the essence of bitcoin is proof of work. That's the novel thing. Public blockchain is just the simplest implementation of doublespend prevention, by the use of a public transaction history. There's nothing special about it.
