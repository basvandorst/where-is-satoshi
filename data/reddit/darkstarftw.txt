Sweep all important funds (BTC, perhaps BCH because of high value) into another address you control. Now, launch a VM, find their respective wallets, import the key and spend. Reasonable worst case is that one of the wallets has a virus and you lose all your other forked shitcoins.

It's not in "limbo". If it doesn't confirm, you can spend the funds again. If it did, you sent the transaction quickly.
Much better than waiting days for a wire transfer.

Most/all of them don't have all the characteristics listed. I'm betting that at least 90% of them have only one dev/dev team and don't scale except for fast blocks and a large block size.

Not all SegWit address start with a 3. Addresses with a 3 can also be a multisig address. Only addresses that begin with bc1 are SegWit 100% of the time.

You can definitely do that, as long as the mnemonic phrase you wrote down is correct. I would generate the wallet offline, and **properly** delete the file before going back online for optimal security.

How is this related to reading at all? I've looked into many altcoins, and except for the DAG ones, most of them don't scale, and are only fast due to fast blocks and large block sizes. Almost every coin also only has a single developer or team behind it?

I believe that the developers of lightning have said that LN is possible without SegWit, just much more harder and confusing to do.

Whatever BTC that isn't part of your change or the address you were sending to becomes the transaction fee.

It's size is 225 bytes. One could argue that sending to SegWit saves a byte, but [transaction sizes can vary by a few bytes]( Also, 1 byte means a potential 10-1000 satoshi more in fees, which is a very small amount.
Also, [here's a source]( talking about which transactions count as SegWit.

Yes. SegWit will reduce your transaction fees, making it cheaper to send BTC. I would still keep the old wallet just in case though.

I agree, but I'd prefer not to spread false information to people to convince them to switch.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:04:45
Legacy -&gt; SegWit is not a SegWit transaction, so it doesn't lower fees for others.
Only SegWit -&gt; SegWit and SegWit -&gt; Legacy are.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:06:56
It's not much effort to make a SegWit wallet, and it will help even if you don't make many transactions. Do you plan on repeatedly buying BTC? If so, that will build up many inputs to spend and SegWit will help significantly.
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:27:58
If a wallet, exchange, etc doesn't want to support SegWit, and I want to support SegWit, I can fairly easily move services. The exchanges financially benefit from switching to SegWit (lower tx fees), and I financially benefit from switching to a SegWit wallet.
If I own a Android phone,
a) The OEM has no direct financial benefit to update the devices
b) I can't switch firmware in most cases. Custom ROMs exist, but often are unstable or straight up unavailable for devices. I'd argue that the average Android user is not very technically capable, and wouldn't even care about updates, let alone a custom ROM.
I would have to buy a new phone for a new Android update, and that provides next to no benefit at a large cost. The same cannot be said for crypto wallets/exchanges.
Android 9 was released 12 days ago; as of now, only the Google Pixel line of phones (total of four phones) and the Essential PH-1 has Android 9. That's a very small percentage of all the phones that can get the update.
@_date: 2018-08-21 16:47:57
To be fair, most devices that aren't on Oreo is because the OEM has not, and never will release an update for their device. They literally can't adopt Oreo.
Apples to oranges comparison imo

Which costs at least $200. Switching from say Armory to Electrum is only going to cost me the transaction fee of moving it. Assuming I had 20 inputs, and pay 1 sat/byte (enough for next block right now), that costs be 20 cents.
Samsung is one of the largest Android phone producers in the world. The Samsung S8 was their flagship early 2017, and costed ~450 EUR. It got Android 8 on March 1, 2018. Android 8 was released on August 21, 2017.


Most charge a fixed fee, and send batch transactions. They can keep the fixed fee the same and profit off of withdraw fees by switching to SegWit. Or, they can lower their fee and advertise "Our withdraw fee is 33% lower than &lt;competitor&gt;!" As far as I know, no well known exchange charges a dynamic withdraw fee.
Additionally, exchanges need to consolidate inputs. SegWit makes consolidating much cheaper.  A 20 input compressed regular address with 1 output is 3004 bytes, while a 20 SegWit input transaction with one output is 2046 bytes. They can save around 30% from each consolidation transaction, which is huge considering the number of deposits they get.


It's a poor analogy. If you're irritated by arguments, the internet is not a good place for you.

That site overestimates fees as well. The best way is to use [Johoe's Bitcoin Mempool size statistics]( and figure out what fee rate has less than 1 MB worth of transactions in it.

Yes. You now should have the equivalent amount of BCC on those private keys in your offline wallet, and you can import the keys with a BCC wallet (such as Electron Cash for SPV client or BitcoinABC for a full node) to access them and spend them.

@_date: 2017-08-06 00:26:23
1. Sweep the BTC from your paper wallet into another wallet (paper wallet if you want to keep it in cold storage).
2. Download BitcoinABC (BCC full node), Electron Cash (BCC SPV wallet) or another BCC wallet
3. Import the same key you swept the BTC from into the BCC wallet
4. You now have your BCC separate from your BTC!

Yes, it's possible like others have said. There are risks with address reusing and if you don't want people to know how much you got in donations, you can use [this script]( which takes an extended BIP 32 key and when a user wants to donate, gives them a fresh address that you own.

I'd still transfer BTC to GDAX to withdraw though to save on Coinbase's transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:24:21
Yeah, you're overpaying on transaction fees. Transfer the funds to GDAX (Coinbase's exchange) from your Coinbase wallet and you can withdraw it for free.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:39:24
I think buying off of Coinbase is slightly easier for people. Otherwise, I don't see a problem with buying off of GDAX. I'm Canadian though and I haven't used Coinbase that much so I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:06:54
No. DO NOT move your coins to am exchange like Coinbase. With Bitcoin Core, you control your private keys, and those private keys let you access your BTC , B2X and whatever other fork comes. After the split, you will just need to import the private key into a B2X wallet and you'll have the B2X spendable. It may be nessecary to separate the coins after the fork because no replay protection is offered.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:17:03
That's not related to customer service. Do you think Coinbase holds those funds on purpose? Wires take time to be processed and verified.

This. Coins need enough hashrate to be secure, and in Bitcoin Gold's case, it was possible to rent enough hashrate off of NiceHash to control 51% of the network and perform a 51% attack, which would allow them to double spend.
[This]( is a good site to see which coins can be 51% attacked with NiceHash, and how much it would cost.
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:13:38
Not all P2Pool nodes signal for BIP 91/Segwit, and I don't think the dev is doing anything to make them signal. They represent a very small % of the bitcoin hashrate, but it's possible that they'll have an orphaned block.
