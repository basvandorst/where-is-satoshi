I'm a huge gamer and nothing would make me happier on BBF to see this, I would easily spend 1 BTC if the sales were things I would be interested in. Unfortunately the dominant players in the space seem the least likely to accept Bitcoin.
It wouldn't surprise me that if the sale was right that one could pull off about $1 million in a day in Bitcoin, gaming companies severely underestimate how much they could make here...especially on a huge day like Black Friday.

Expecting startups that are just getting funding to do big-spending on mainstream advertising is ridiculous and not smart. Television advertising is extremely expensive and the next round of adopters will be easier reached on the Internet anyways.
Circle and Bitpay seem to have great products that continue to improve, and although I've had issues with Coinbase, they have many satisfied customers so it's hard to dismiss them. The largest companies in the space are spending their money wisely to improve the user experience and diversifying bitcoin into things like Payroll, Tipping and NFC.
Advertising is not the answer here, continuing to improve the technology is most important. What would help significantly more than that would be to get influential people (from any field) to understand and speak on it. Joe Rogan, Bill Gates and 50 Cent are more important to the overall impression of Bitcoin than any advertising could do. The one thing any Bitcoiner can do with a famous friend is get them involved, their audience listens more than the same talking heads with suits on business TV and on this forum.

Do you really expect parents who probably don't even understand the Internet to get this? When all someone who barely follows real news hears about bitcoin is bad, do you really think they are wanting to sign up for this?
Your assumption that parents are remotely financially or technologically literate is way off, few are and most aren't.

They are the company that convinced my small business to accept Bitcoin after a bad experience with Coinbase. I don't want to be a cheerleader for them but they blew Coinbase out of the water with both customer support and the number of wallets supported.
There is also no surprise that vendors are switching from Coinbase to Bitpay. It's becoming clear that they understand who their customers are and are specializing to provide a better experience for them.

The Bitcoin Foundation needs to just fade away into obscurity and exist only of a remnant of the "wild west" era of bitcoin. A coalition of Bitcoin players is a great idea now that a few companies are established leaders in the space, but the Foundation was in an earlier era before this.
There's a lot of "they should, he should, she should" but it seems like all attempts fail to see a big picture and the forces that are working against it.

I just did some quick research and realized that bitpay seems to have a much better reputation online by a wide margin. 
Originally I used coinbase because I could buy some bitcoin personally to test it out and it worked fine so I chose them over bitpay. From what I see bitpay works with every wallet so I am using them. It seems that coinbase should stick to selling bitcoin because my experience was terrible after that original bitcoin purchase.

Or, use Wiziwig for an "alternate stream"

When it comes to ways to get new people into bitcoin, this idea is one of the better ones.
About 2 million people should watch the game and ESPN bowl games tend to rank very high on social media trending reports so this should reduce the amount of scammers that participate.
I myself will do some tipping on that hashtag that day just because it's a great way to spread the word in a mainstream way.
Surprises me to see some of the negativity about this, it's the exact thing the community should want to increase adoption.

More people are using it than ever and investors are mad.
Sounds like a win to me.

There are also way more than 25,000 but the infographic uses Gyft merchants which technically doesn't count. If you are going to mess something up, why would you headline with a less impressive number and include big name merchants in the graphic?

You can try wiziwig for live streams, just be sure to catch an American feed so you can see all the bitcoin commercials that might be on.

This sounds interesting, I wonder if they will be doing $100 tips like Pantera Capital did a few weeks ago. If this is promoted right it could be a big deal on social media.

I think it was a given it would be better last year with the price and hype being so high.
I'm actually quite surprised by the diversity of merchants and growth in the fields it has grown, definitely makes me feel more comfortable about Black Friday this year.

There is a difference between asking and begging, and why wouldn't you want to get a better deal?
