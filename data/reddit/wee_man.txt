A few months ago I setup a stop-loss for $10k. Deleted it last week on a whim.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:58:49
Then it reached $20k as December closed. That was completely unsustainable and now we're back where it should have been all along. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:13:03
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:38:03
According to multiple articles they haven't sold a single coin since buying $10M worth.

You should probably learn how to spell/pronounce Stanford correctly before giving your speech.

But...the guy who mortgaged his house made $3 million. s/
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:18:42
That's the privileged "insider Trading" price. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:49:58
He got in for $7k which is 62% of the current price. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:11:16
Or it could go to less than $100; nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:13:20
It hit around $9300 in the last week.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:46:30
Don't ask the internet for financial advice, especially this sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:21:53
Awesome - thank you for your service. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:49:31


Isn't that actually the whole point of your post? This would have negated the fees you're complaining about. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:40:09
A month ago I bought more at the ATH of $7,833 and was really mad...for about two weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:06:46
Anyone who bought at $200 would have sold at $1000
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:56:53
If you don't like the rules, then don't play the game. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:50:48
Yes but gold has a 3,000+ year currency history and Bitcoin has a seven year history. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:51:52
Doesn't it just mean less overall supply?
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:50:29
OP's post provides an overview of his investment strategy. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:45:42
Sorry but this is a wall of text and questions...do your research, read the sidebar and FAQ. All this information is readily available. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:55:38
What about fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:56:09
0.1 &gt; 0.0 so yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:16:20
Wait for the dip to plateau. It just started overnight. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:06:18
Can someone ELI5 please?
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:05:59
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:14:53
So...you're holding?
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:03:27
I'm going to venture a guess you're single. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:53:28
I just reached the .9 club last week. When is our next meeting?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:11:58
*hodl up
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:15:23
October 1st it was at $4400. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:51:53
Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:54:51
If $20k was nothing to him then he wouldn't need a loan to access $20k. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:00:06
S/ ?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:28:04
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:53:09
Today's ATH is next month's bargain. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:17:17
Have you researched this process at all? Not that I don't mind helping, but these are fundamental questions you should know before using a hard wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:55:25
Always HODL. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:17:00
Nothing, I was just stating a fact. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:48:15
Yes and no. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:37:33
What happened to the coins that went down with Gox?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:49:41
You mean $7,700
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:02:07
Please explain further...
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:52:04
I would avoid asking for Bitcoin/financial advice on the internet, especially in this sub. Only you can determine what to do for your specific situation. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:14:36


No, you cannot.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:18:14
Read the FAQ  
Read the sidebar  
Do your research  
Don't ask the internet for advice
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:16:08
Yep! Still on HODL since 2014. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:25:16




@_date: 2017-11-29 14:58:23
That's what they said in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:40:11
There was a massive sell-off in Japan. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:04:01
You're asking us to see into the future - this is a pointless question. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:58:14
spike, dip, spike. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:14:04
Anywhere from 5 minutes to a few hours depending on backlog. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:53:14
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:48:36
It was at $5700 almost exactly a month ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:54:39
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:14:48
...and here comes the rebound. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:15:26
Congrats! I pulled a bunch of your personal information out of the picture's metadata. You might want to change that. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:35:39
Like the dip that's happening today for example. Down $600 and about to slip back below $7k. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:44:41
You buy at whatever price it was at the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:12:36
You must be new here. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:17:16
I tried logging into GDAX via my Coinbase and it says there's an "error accessing your webcam". 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:49:09
Land whales. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:31:54
The other parts.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:42:07
Trezor, hands down. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:57:13
Same exact situation here..luckily that will be a discount when it hits 10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:12:18
Please elaborate. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:00:30
Same here. Luckily there will be a new path eventually. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:55:06
People invest in gold and fiat, it's the same general concept. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:38:49
Down $600 since your post...
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:30:09
This sounds like a recipe for disaster. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:55:45
Eh, I wouldn't rely on memory. Make three copies and store them in separate places. I personally keep a hard copy in a bank safety deposit box, one on a thumb drive and one in the cloud.  
Many, many people have lost Bitcoin by forgetting their recovery password or 24-words. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:59:46

@_date: 2017-11-08 21:37:05
Won't the final few coins take an extremely long time to mine?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:57:42
Fun fact: 0.03% of Bitcoin trading happens on a Blackberry. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:55:27
I bought at $7833 and was really frustrated. Not anymore!
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:15:54
I bought 300 coins when it dropped $60. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:55:11
- Pick a random pin nobody can guess  
- Backup your recovery words in several places, ideally a bank safety deposit box  
- Send a very small amount of BTC first to test

Someone is dumping huge orders. There's been about a dozen on GDAX in the last 20 mins. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:02:56
Well, you meant to...you're just regretting it. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:53:34
Predicting Bitcoin value is pointless; just enjoy the ride. If it goes up, you're doing well. If it goes down, buy more. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:22:16
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:29:49
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:55:27
Yes you can; you just don't know how. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:01:42
My advice - don't seek financial/investment advice from the internet; especially in this sub. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:13:19
Edging. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:38:17
When you set up the wallet you are given a 24 word seed. You can use this to recover your bitcoin in the case of the wallet breaking or you losing it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:08:15
I just moved my coins to a Trezor this week from Coinbase. Bought the Trezon on Amazon for $100. It takes a bit of time to figure everything out, but well worth the piece of mind.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:06:57
Coinbase and hook-up your routing/checking account, otherwise it takes a few days to verify your debit card. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:00:32
You can call phone support, just be prepared for a 45-minute wait.

No, we saw $14k back in December, before it blew by and we hit $19k. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:46:57
Buy 200 a month in BTC. Then HODL. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:04:31
I almost sold last week at $5,900.  
Then I almost bought at $5,900.   
Instead I just HODL'd and still happy. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:06:32
I'm looking forward to your thesis: "How to lose money investing in Bitcoin". 
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:45:50
I would consider major hacks and stolen coins as "severe issues".
