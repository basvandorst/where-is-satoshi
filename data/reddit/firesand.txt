Hmm. I have some doubts about this. It seems to me that the industry has shifted not died. The californian porn industry probably used outdated models for content, protection, and delivery.
Moreover porn is a "public good" which means that once a certain amount has been made it in a given 'area' people need to diversify or they will gain less and less revenue. 
They probably expected to be protected under the same copyright models used by Hollywood. This is silly because porn is generally not a high budget project. 
Moreover  Hollywood type porn companies probably did not deliver what people wanted the most: anonymous and fast deliver of  content. 
Anyways I have not watched the documentary but these are my speculations. 
TLDR: Old porn companies models where based on a broken and short sited model. They worked very well of a little while. 
Edit: People creating IP content need to focus on turning it from a public good, to a private good.
Examples: Netflix, Steam, Spotify. All these companies provide a service not just copyrights usage.

You are kind of missing the point. I am not trying to make the point that all small financial institutions are targeted or that none of them end up fine. I am making the point that large ones are shown deference. 
So in the same situation them will fair better.

This is the great experiment. We need to come up with non-government solutions to these problems.
Markets evolve. They are not perfect from the start. This is a new market and it is our job to make it work. 
It will not be easy, but it is necessary. Private law, contract law, huge online support. We have all these and more at our disposal. 
In this area I have faith in humanity and in markets which are systems created purposely and spontaneously by humans and chance.

Seriously? The fact the government gives deference to huge large financial institutions over small ones is "tinfoil being worn ".

True but I don't think we want Monopolized government law to step in.  Lets come up with private and contract law solutions.

I think he means initially. He might be right.

Hmm. Ok. But I think it is more likely that some in government just had it out for that CEO because of bitcoin.

The things I was thinking of are not currently in a digital format and they are obscure. I suppose if this idea was very prevalent they would probably be available.

You can hardly blame him. Not only is Bitcoin confusing: it suits people that are involved in the computer age much better.

Liberty and freedom is never *brought about* by violence. 
It is *brought about* by a change in the minds of thousands and millions of people. It is *brought about* by strong ideas, old and new. That does not mean there is never violence that happens in the processes: but violence is never the process.

Thanks, solid analysis. It might take a few years I think what you are saying would become true.
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:44:04
I think I will go with the flags for this one, thank you.

I don't know about that.

It is certainly relevant to me. I have been think about buying for a long time.

This is why to me, it does not matter if Bitcoin is stable. If you want you can buy Bitcoins right before a transaction or sell them right after a transaction. 
The biggest power of Bitcoin in my opinion is not the power to store value, but the power to transfer value instantly to anywhere in the world to anyone without ether of you having to know anything about each other.

To be accurate I would say it: may be, or often is, distinguishable.
