I work for a bank and I don't see a need to "deal" with bitcoin in any way.  Bitcoin is about as much of my concern as dogs teeth and sea shells used as currency in Kiribati.  Whatever works for them is just fine by me.  If the people of Kiribati got all huffy about wanting me to accept their dogs teeth for deposit I'd let them know the fees I'd charge for the service would be in US dollars and that would be that.  Some of this bitcoin persecution anxiety is silly.

If the bitcoin can be acquired and held by an IRS approved IRA custodian, yes.  Finding a legitimate IRA custodian that is able to acquire and hold bitcoin within your IRA is the challenge.

Who is your IRA Custodian?

You need to find a brokerage or private investment firm that is also an IRS approved IRA custodian.  The IRS maintains a list of all approved non-bank IRA Custodians here:

I work in the regulatory side of the IRA world.  I'm not looking to set up a new IRA but I always keep my eyes open for custodians that are willing to take on self directed IRAs, as there really are very few out there.  Broad Financial is not an IRA custodian, they share self directed IRA knowledge and help people like you set up LLCs specifically to be funded by self directed IRAs.  Once they did that, did Broad Financial direct you to a financial institution that would accept self directed IRAs or were you on your own?

Of those three IRA Providers only PENSCO was actually an IRS approved non-bank custodian and does a great job being open and honest about its importance:  
You can always look up approved non-bank IRA custodians here:  
These other self directed IRA "administrators" use banks, often with very little in the way of any IRA knowledge on staff, as a nominal custodian or trustee.

Contributions to an IRA must be made in US currency.  You also cannot purchase something you already own with cash already in your IRA.  So if you already have a stash of bitcoin you couldn't sell them to your IRA.

Can bitcoin transcend the need for dollars? Everyone seems to clamor over bitcoin based on dollar value not because of their perceived value of bitcoin itself.  Ultimately it seems that bitcoin is actually propping up the perceived value of dollars much more than of bitcoin.
