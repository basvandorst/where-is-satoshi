"Holdings" vs "life savings"
Who trades their life savings? Knowing full well even without being scammed you could loose it all in a bad trade. 
And you do have another option other than suicide, the option is there right now. **Take your bitcoin off these back ally exchanges (includes coinbase) and get them on something more secure**, by you saying you would take the exit door from life if you get robbed is like playing Russian roulette because unfortunately these exchanges are easy targets. 
If youre trading, don't trade your life savings. Play with 20% or something. If you of the riskier nature bump it up to 30 or 50%. But never 100.

Not really letting the market decide if i keep my bitcoin with coinbase, would like a segwit address, dont trust any other exchange because Coinbase seem the most trustworthy to me amongst the Krakens and Finex's out there but the CEO of Coinbase is currently more interested in having multiple, competing implimentations of Bitcoin instead of focusing even a little on Bitcoin itself. Me amongst potentially a million others. I think this whole ordeal just shows that Coinbase currently has way to much power in the space. 
Especially when these companies such as coinbase, Bitpay and [SS] alike, incorrectly believe that they speak on behalf of their users. So if Mr Brian Armstrong doesnt believe Segwit to be a priority then according to him the millions of people that use coinbase including you, Bob &amp; Alice, also do not belive segwit to be a priority simply because you use their service. 
E: its late. Just re-read your comment. I think i misunderstood you initially. Everyone should vote with their pockets and stop supporting coinbase.  Ill leave my comment up though.

Sharing bitcoin is a terrible idea. There is exactly 0 benefit in doing this even if one is more technically capable than the other. On the other hand there are countless issues that can come up in future if sharing Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:51:00
If bitcoin was $1,000,000 /BTC and you had $500 worth of BTC, would you notice the price fluctuations much at all? Would it even be as volatile at $1M? 
In future the Bitcoin blockchain may only serve as a base to a multiple [layers 3 &amp; 4] layered technology and who the hell knows what doors those will unlock. People describe Bitcoins future as if its based off bitcoin today. Bitcoin will not be the same 5/10/20 years from now, its constantly changing. How can he say *"Bitcoin wont be the dominant system,"* when most people dont even know where the Bitcoin Blockchain is headed? Who the hell could have imagined Youtube, Uber, Facebook, Snapchat, PSN, XBL, Facetime, Alexa etc etc 20 years ago? We are still **very, very** early into this whole space, no one can make such definitive statements in either direction.

Why 20k? where do you get this number from? You could have said the same thing at $10k just a few short months ago when fees were also high, and you would have been wrong.  If you think "high fees" are are going to stop the currently rally, ill assure you that you're mistaken. Scalability fixes are rolling out right now and the market knows this.

I agree 100%, which is why I'm 99% sure they are playing a childish political game when it comes to not adding Segwit. Users want lower fees, regardless of whether or not they know what Segwit is.

@_date: 2017-12-13 09:23:32
Yes. If something catastrophic were to happen to bitcoin first. As 100 people in the street about bitcoin, 10 will know what you're talking about. Ask 100 people in the street about an altcoin those same 10 people will probably still mention Bitcoin. 
There's a reason Bitcoin (and some top alts) are constantly under attack, at this point in the game Bitcoins downfall means another can shine, until then bitcoin will hold its number 1 spot for the forseable future.

["There is no need to settle unless someone on the lightning network tries to misbehave.  The threat of the ability to settle keeps everyone honest.
Additionally, there is no reason the funding of a channel must come from the Bitcoin network. It can equally come from the lightning network side. A channel with no funds can be created without any on-chain transactions. It can then be funded with a lightning network transaction. This will evolve as the lightning network maintains more funds, as a natural progression.  This way, we may not even need larger blocks.  We could scale "to the moon"](

Umm, [something is being done]( The fee paid in that video was $0.001
These things cannot be rushed considering we are talking about a multi-billion $ network, there is 0 room for mistakes, 0 room for hic-ups. Security needs to be 10/10. Decentralisation needs to be kept in tact. Will your fees drop today? As in this day specifically? No, but something **IS** being done, and there are people (many unpaid!) working on scaling bitcoin and reducing fees every single day.

**Do not** underestimate the political petty of coinbase. Has no one seen Brian's comments on Segwit in the last few weeks? Does no one remember Brian's comments in the past about wanted competing Bitcoin implementations? Coinbase are not the good guys, the sooner we accept that the sooner we can move on. I for one would not be surprised if come January coinbase adds buy options for Bcash, I also will not be surprised once we start seeing posts from newbies claiming to have lost Bitcoin sending it to the wrong wallet etc just as we see now with bitcoin com's wallet. Let's all take a moment to remember we're talking about the same company that supported a rushed HF that if went ahead would have grinded the network to a halt, these people almost helped take down bitcoin.

Very patronising. You make this statement but then in turn also give me no reasons as to why its not. 


I did say above that I do believe it's cheap to call Bitcoin a store of value in its current form. Bitcoin can be saved. Bitcoin can be exchange and redeemed for other currencies, commodities, goods and services. Bitcoins value and usecase cannot be predicted (also why I only speak of potential).

It is a currency but not *just* a currency not in the traditional sense anyway. [Its programmable money]( Forget buying coffees and lambos think about machine to machine transactions, or nano transactions. We also have to remember that finance isn't the only industry that will be affected by Bitcoin.
Sorry. it is a store of value. I know its cheap to mention it as such right now but you can bet your last dollar that Bitcoin will have an impact on markets such as gold within in the next 10 years. Over the last 9 years Bitcoin has seen a decline in volatility. Another decade or two and a 6 or 7 figure Bitcoin wouldn't be anywhere near as volatile as it is today. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:33:55
That's the thing though, it's not just a currency. You guys don't have the slightest clue if you think Bitcoins possibilities end at currency.
People are thinking way too small here, I do want to point out however that my claim isn't that it will reach $1m especially for 2020, just that its not impossible. Bitcoin is something new, so who the hell knows where it will be in the future. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:34:58
The general thought is most of that market share will probably be between less than 5 cryptocurrencies. I don't think we can place a number on what the total marketcap of crypto will be if Bitcoin were to one day reach $1m.

@_date: 2018-03-08 19:51:33
When you say you belive Bitcoin Cash will win the payments race over Bitcoin, where do you invision Bitcoin (BTC) at the end of that race?
As is now, not *many* people actually take Bitcoin Cash seriously and if we're being candid not many people take Bitcoin serious right now either, not as a payment system anyways. My point is while everyone is blinded by the price, in the background some serious work is being done on Bitcoin and even if the price is $10k $100k or 1$M that isn't going to suddenly change the fact that most people outside the crypto community don't take cryptos serious as a payment method. 
LN right now isn't ready, but just as Bitcoin today isn't what it was 5 years ago, do you honestly believe LN will look the same in 5 years time as it does today? To the point where people are choosing to use an even more controversial coin over Bitcoin?

It kind of is. When you take into consideration there are like a hundred other posts that show "look Bitcoin goes up X every time Y occurs" that also all look like they make sense independently, but show completely different data than the other. They can't possibly all be correct.
Don't get me wrong, I think it's going up just as much as the next bitcoiner does, but I think we mostly look at these for reassurance (also maybe not a bad thing). I'm sure others could create post explain why Bitcoin as going down to $3k before it gets any where close to $20k again and everyone that *wants* to see Bitcoin back at those levels will surely take such a post as gospel just as mooners will look at a post like this and claim prophecy.
Again, don't get me wrong I also think we're going up and I am not immune to maybe seeing what I want to see. Even I have a chart I'm following and check weekly to confirm for myself that were still heading in the right direction.
