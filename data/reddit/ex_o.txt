What a horrible headline. The order had nothing to do with Bitcoin. A company was halted from selling unregistered securities -- i.e., that they were bought with bitcoins is irrelevant.
If anything, this is directly in line with Shavers (which was also tied to securities laws involving the purchase of securities with bitcoins).

Drop in price is probably related to Ethereum.  The ether sale included this risk factor (note the last line):
19.1 Risk of Dissolution of The Ethereum Project Due To a Diminishment in the Value of the BTC Sale
All Purchasers are paying BTC to purchase ETH. In the past few months the price of BTC in United States
dollars has been relatively stable. However, despite recent price stability, it is possible that the value of BTC
will drop significantly in the future, depriving EthSuisse of sufficient resources to continue to operate. In
order to guard against this risk, EthSuisse intends to periodically convert proceeds from the sale of ETH into
fiat currencies instead of BTC.

Bitcoin isn't completely all-or-nothing in respect of replacing Fiat currency or not, IMO.  There's definitely space as a niche and it is highly unlikely to entirely replace fiat currency on a global or even single-country scale.  That's just not in the cards.  It can, however, take off and still be enormously successful both as a payment system and store of value.  
And yes, user error is not the fault of Bitcoin.  The reality is, though, that Bitcoin isn't user friendly for everyone (few things are user friendly for everyone).  But it is true that the irreversibility of loss (where appropriate backups are not in place for whatever reason) is a negative for Bitcoin when it goes truly mainstream.  You will have people losing private keys and, therefore, significant money.  A more trustworthy service provider economy has the ability to remove some of that risk, but that reliable service provider economy does not currently exist.

Unregulated digital assets aren't long term feasible. Agree there. Once they become more long-term, more parties become interested and the bad actors in such an unregulated environment abuse too many people... resulting in regulation.
Despite what most think about regulation in today's anti-government attitude, regulation is usually intended to protect investors a heck of a lot more than it is intended to benefit lobbyists.  I see no reason to assume the investigations into and regulation of Bitcoin has any other motive (although a strong hand appears to also be on the money laundering side, which is misguided, but also seeks to do a public good).

It's not a tax haven, really. While they don't have truly burdensome state registration taxes like California, what makes them the venue for selection is 
a) generally company-friendly statutes (particularly, the ability to draft company-friendly governing documents like certificates of incorporation, bylaws, operating agreements, etc);
b) an active state legislature that updates those statutes that govern corporations, partnerships, LLCs and statutory trusts on an annual basis, as needed, to make sure that the latest innovations and market leading principles are included; and
c) a chancery court system that has, by far, the most developed interpretation of those statutes (relative to other states' interpretations of their own statutes). 
Those (and not tax haven status) are the reasons that a plurality businesses incorporate or form in Delaware. It makes sense that Mt. Gox would do the same.

25K obviously isn't that much, so I wouldn't read too much into this.

BS&amp;T was a scheme that happened to involve Bitcoin. Shavers tried to argue that Bitcoin was not a form of money in a manner to avoid the charges he faced, but that was squashed by the judge in a memorandum opinion which called Bitcoin a "form of money", though not a full currency.
The actual case itself does not really involve regulation of bitcoin in any way other than that memorandum opinion. The crackdown on Shavers was because of criminal actions that were non-Bitcoin specific (though BS&amp;T did involve the investment in Bitcoins).  The SEC put out a warning on Bitcoin scams as a result, but has still not provided any guidance on whether they will attempt to exert regulatory authority over Bitcoin (unlikely, as it is more a CFTC asset class).

People are vastly overstating the likelihood of Bitcoin being deemed illegal. Regulation is coming, but that is natural and does not need to be a negative thing (sensible regulation designed for Bitcoin would be a positive).
Beyond point 1 (which is an amusing and somewhat true factor), there really is no justification for making Bitcoin illegal. The Mercatus paper actually makes a strong justification for Bitcoin's legality. The DPR indictment actually makes an even stronger case for legality. And the Shavers opinion does too.

Frankly, I think you're a little too pessimistic on the nature of commercial exploitation.  To be honest, the best thing that could happen to Bitcoin is that it be embraced by the commercial sector (including financial institutions).  It would require regulation first, but suddenly your Bitcoins would actually be usable in the real world on an everyday basis and, guess what, the ones you own now would skyrocket in value. For those expecting BTC to crack four digits in value, good luck on that happening anytime soon without the mainstream economy starting to buy in and "absorb" Bitcoin into their business models.

They wouldn't technically have to, but the USG could make their life a living hell with respect to banking with any institution that has US operations. And regulating money transmitters isn't solely intent on AML/KYC. You want certain basic capital requirements / identity of operators / compliance procedures to be ensured. There have been enough poorly planned or fraudulent BTC service providers to show a need for some level of regulation, IMO. The problem is that BTC doesn't fit well with existing money service business regulation, particularly given the related costs.

In the era of FATCA and whatnot, you really don't think Mt. Gox has to comply with US law while doing business with US customers.  Whether they *should have to is one thing, but the US government certainly could find ways to make Gox' life a living hell.
As a further note, while the registration / licensure process is annoying for businesses (particularly start-ups), a decent portion of the design of the system also is made to protect consumers.  The federal level (registration with FinCEN) just requires AML/KYC, but the state level in some jurisdictions examines certain things to make sure the business is legitimate.  And given the number of fraudulent, bad actor start-ups in Bitcoin, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  
Regulation has a double-edged sword aspect to it --&gt; protecting consumers is a big benefits, but the system can also be too arduous and expensive.

You needed early liquidity to get a foothold.  You also needed early adoption to do so.  Easiest way to accomplish both was to push out early volume of Bitcoin.  Yes, the scale could have been made to push out a bit further, but, IMO, benefiting early adopters was a necessary evil.  Perhaps one way this could have been shifted would be something like 5 - 10 - 5 - 2.5 - 1.25 - and so on, but really folks should not oppose Bitcoin based on this fact.  Nor should people assume either purely altruistic or greed motives to Satoshi (or Satoshi in the plural).  We don't know enough about him beyond his brilliance and the elegance of his creation.

Gold has certain industrial uses, but they are very limited.  Jewelry is a store of value from a day long past that has evolved into a cultural factor that we don't immediately assume is a store of value.  That said, gold's intrinsic value is not that different from Bitcoin's (other than those very limited industrial uses).  For example, according to WGC, about 12% of annual gold demand is from technology and dentistry.  If you removed the jewelry (cultural store of value), direct investment and central bank purchasing, you just cut nearly 90% of gold's demand and almost zeroed out its actual value.
So, yes, obviously, without people thinking Bitcoin has value (i.e., non-intrinsic value), Bitcoins get you nowhere except in using mining to heat your home very inefficiently. That said, gold doesn't have as much intrinsic value as people assume it does.

Except you need a world economy around it.  America defaulting means the world economy goes into a vast downward spiral and the capital needed for Bitcoin growth in the mainstream disappears... such that, while an individual Bitcoin may have inherent upward movement in price per USD, it is because the USD has collapse, not because BTC's purchasing power has necessarily gone up.  For a jolt in BTC price that is actually meaningful, economic growth fostering an environment of innovation and widespread adoption is needed.
Also, y'all who are rooting for the collapse of the world economy (even in the hypothetical) are pretty freaking sick given the pain it would cause everyone (particularly those who are not well off).

If you mean, does the US government now own Bitcoin?  Yes.  Do they have an investment intent or intentional stake in Bitcoin's success?  No.  Per the seizure order, the US seized the Bitcoins intentionally and transferred them to a digital wallet created and controlled by US Government.  This was does under the same law that allows the seizure of cash and hard assets.  It does not implicate an investment intent and the Government will, if they can prove their case -- which seems likely -- have full ownership of the Bitcoin under civil forfeiture law.  At that point, I imagine they would immediately sell the BTC for USD.  
But no, this doesn't mean the US Government is anything more than an unintentional, temporary stakeholder.

No doubt that is true, but one rarely holds large sums of cash as one can with Bitcoin. The lack of a backstop is a negative effect of Bitcoin if adopted by people who don't understand that risk.  
I'm a Bitcoin evangelist, but I make sure people I tell about it that they understand that risk first and foremost.  Second thing I say is that there's a 95% likelyhood that Bitcoin will go either way up in value or bottom out to zero (5% chance of slow growth or stagnation) and that they should be willing to accept either circumstance.

For one, the World Bank lacks the regulatory authority to do anything. They are a banking institution that provides capital to the developing world through loans. They can require certain conditions to those loans, but there is no reason they would be at the forefront of fighting Bitcoin. 
If, by World Bank, you mean "The Man" or institutionalized power in general, they'd essentially cripple Bitcoin's growth by targeting and regulating businesses.  That would have to be done on a country by country basis, though.  I suppose the US, UK, China and Russia could also try to destroy Bitcoin from within by dedicating malicious computer power, but that's unlikely.

Depends on what you mean by a significant portion of the global money supply. The USDollar has about $10 or $11 Trillion in money supply.  Bitcoin has around $1B, but that's only if you also count permanently lost coins (which are probably no less than 10% of what's been mined so far).  If you guestimate that about 40% will be lost by the time the 21 millionth coin is mined, and $1 Trillion as deemed a significant portion of the global money supply, then you'd need a price point of about $80,000/BTC to crack that arbitrary "significant" level.
Technological barriers to entry is probably the biggest barrier currently, but that could evaporate over time.  Really, I'd say the biggest barrier is that the "permanent loss" element will not only reduce the actual number of Bitcoins possessed, but also trust and confidence of many people in using BTC as a store of money or for transactions.  
A second element is that I'm not sure BTC is terribly practical for quick in person transactions in nations with reliable fiat cash.
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:34:52
It's still the early adopter phase, so it's completely unfair to compare where BTC is now to where it will be in the future.  It may be that Bitcoin will always be more commodity money than currency, but the stability of BTC will likely be something you can rely on more as mainstream adoption progresses.

If you are not concerned with pseudonimity issues, you can feel free to use a receiving address as many times as you want, so long as you don't spend from it.
A Bitcoin "account" (of which more than one may be stored in a wallet client) is comprised of three things: 
a) a private key which is never exposed, but is used to sign transactions/messages;
b) a public key (which is linked to the private key through a SHA256 cryptography algorithm); and
c) a public address (which is linked to the public key through a SHA256 cryptography algorithm and a HASH160 function).  
For each valid private key, there is only one public key and for each valid public key there is only one public address.  It is not possible to "brute force" or "key guess" to reverse engineer a private key (or public key) from a public address; however, it is possible using enormous amounts of time and energy to reverse engineer a private key from a public key (this is not a real threat right now, but could become one in the event that quantum computers are realized, providing enormous computing capacity).
Your public address, therefore, can be public without you fearing or needing a new address.  The public address is what you tell people to send to.
Your public key is only revealed when you send Bitcoin from a wallet.  At this point, you have opened yourself up to a largely theoretical risk; nevertheless, once you've conducted a spend, you should start thinking about getting a new wallet at some point.  
Your private key is never revealed on the network, though a Hash (a derivation that is non-reversible) of it is reflected to prove you "signed" or sent a transaction or message.
In theory, someone could start a wallet with the same private key as you (and therefore the same public key and public address -- meaning you both have access to the same wallet); however, the chances of this are so ridiculously small that you can pretty much guarantee this will not happen more than once, if at all, to anyone on the network over the next five years.  
Why, you ask?  Well, there are 2^77 possible private keys (to put into perspective, the number of atoms in the visible universe is 2^82).  While not all private keys are "valid", a random number key guesser still is starting from that total universe of 2^77 possible private keys (there are 2^32 possible valid Bitcoin accounts).  These numbers are so ridiculously large as to make an "address collision" a non-factor.

I think you're making a big assumption that the world financial markets cannot figure out a way to turn Bitcoin into a tool that can be exploited (mind you, in the profit sense rather than the exploitation of individuals).  I could easily see regulatory standards being put into place that benefit Bitcoin users without making it too overly onerous for Bitcoin money services business to operate.  Frankly, that would benefit the Network greatly in removing a) people who are out to scam and b) people who don't have the capital or infrastructure to properly support their businesses.
There have been plenty of new innovations which challenged and completely altered the marketplace (be it financial or otherwise) that resulted in absorption rather than rejection.  Frankly, the two primary reasons Bitcoin is viewed as rebellious by the marketplace is the technological complexity and the misinformed association of all Bitcoin with illegal activity and anonymity.

This is basically correct. Federal is registration with FinCEN and required AML/KYC compliance with the BSA and Patriot Act. 
States have the authority to require licenses which may or may not be an arduous process and may or may not impose significant requirements. All but two states currently require money transmitters licenses and most require licenses if you even simply offer services to people in their state. Functionally, this is more expensive and difficult than Federal registration by an order of many, many magnitudes.

Because Mt. Gox offers it services to US residents, many states would require that they be licensed in such state regardless of whether they have active operations in the state.

Furthermore, for this same reason, CampBX is not really in full compliance (they are licensed only in Georgia, but not other states).

Certainly, cash or card seems more simple in large part because all the hardware is there.  Now if discounts were available because no CCFees are being charged, it would seem worthwhile. But merchants don't do that for cash, so I don't expect to see that in brick and mortar shops.

Germany and Canada would probably be considered the two most "Bitcoin friendly" environments right now, from a regulatory perspective. Both countries have released guidance on taxation of Bitcoin, but have decided it is not ripe for money services business regulation just yet. Neither country views it as true currency (in Canada, it fails a legal test defining currency as money issued by a country, and, in Germany, it has been deemed to be “unit of account” or "Rechnungseinheiten", something just short of currency).
As a result, and particularly in Germany, Bitcoin is booming from a start up perspective and is gaining a more marginal foothold in actual use.

Why would you sign up for Mt. Gox (assuming you're US)?

Good question indeed. They certainly would have to do so at some form of open auction, which would best be on a Bitcoin Exchange; however, doing so would be difficult to the extent that they would only be likely to do so with a Bitcoin Exchange that is fully compliant with US regulation... which sure as heck isn't clear any are (particularly that I don't believe even CampBX is licensed by any state other than Georgia -- and they likely need to be licensed by 47 other states to be deemed fully compliant). Then you also have the issue of an exchange that can handle the volume (or they would have to parse out the sales).  They could also do a "live auction" of sorts off an exchange.  Really a quite interesting question.

As in something you could use everyday? If you're into Bitcoin as a means of being in a secret society, you should be putting your money elsewhere.
The nice thing about Bitcoin is that every user has the same rights as every other user under the protocol. Goldman won't be able to alter the protocol just by entering play. Furthermore, the end result of messing with the Network's protocols in a way that hurts users is either a) a messy fork that results, probably, in those edits being rolled back to realign with the unfussed chain or b) a collapse of Bitcoin as users lose confidence in the network.  Neither result benefits Goldman or any other actor.
I think people are overstating the threat that Bitcoin presents to the global money supply status quo and, therefore, are assuming "The Man" will lash out at Bitcoin.  Nope, institutions will look to see how they can integrate and make money off it... which, amazingly is exactly what all of us did when we first learned of Bitcoin -- only Goldman is less likely to loudly say "Cool!" when they first understood it.

warning, if your income exceeds the allowable threshholds for qualify for state aid, you may lose your welfare.  Consider that when determining how much you sell.

So, you're saying you seek to earn money on market volatility, but can't imagine financial institutions doing the same as a means of getting interested in Bitcoin?
Not trying to be antagonistic, but just saying that I think there are a lot of people who assume there will be institutional opposition to Bitcoin as a rule. I disagree.

Mining should be viewed only as a hobby and not as an investment or cost-effective way to earn BTC.  It is too difficult to mine without a) burning large amounts of electricity and b) using expensive, high end equipment.  Just buy BTC unless you want to mine for the fun of it.

That and the fact that anyone could have been an early adopter who benefited. I wish I had been one, but why begrudge people who were? Someone had to have faith in the system early for it to work.

How do you explain Bitcoin mining in a 10 second answer? Not really possible in a short form interview. The reality is that Bitcoin mechanics can't be easily explained in a short form, and that's one of the difficulties the technology has faced in re: acceptance from people who aren't willing to invest the time to understand it.

The Department of the Treasury and the FBI (or whomever has the BTC when liquidated) has no mandate to do such a thing. Does our government do messed up things?  Sure, but to do so publicly would lead to a shitstorm of trouble for whoever makes the call to do so.
