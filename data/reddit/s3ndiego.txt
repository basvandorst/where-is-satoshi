Feminists are so butthurt that the market doesn't favour women. They're so focused on that fact (I. E. Focused on themselves) and not on the market. And that's why they're unsuccessful. It's just an inherent trait that most women share. 
Whereas men will usually just focus on the market and try to dominate it instead of complaining about the nature of it (not that there aren't guys who are whiners, though).

Men dominate future-oriented industries. Most futurologists, scientists, mathematicians, sci-fi writers, investors, VR and video game designers and so on are men. Most women jump on the bandwagon once things become more socially acceptable. There's nothing inherently wrong about these differences. It's just the way it is.

Because women are usually followers. Men will always be in the majority of those at the cutting edge, higher risk sections of society. And it's not unfortunate, it's just the way it is.

That's exactly what they're afraid of. Being weird makes no sense because women are highly social. Women being weirder than men would make social cohesion too difficult and the human race would fall apart. Women need to be mostly homogeneous for it to work. 
Because they're the child-bearers and become EVEN LESS physically-able when pregnant, it also makes them more risk averse. Men are the risk takers because there will always be enough men to repopulate even if a bunch of them die (hunting, tribal fights, wars etc.).
Men are more likely to be at the extreme ends left and right of the bell curve in almost all arenas. Women tend to cluster around the middle, i.e. average, with far fewer women at the extremes.
You know nothing.

Women almost rarely do anything weird, extreme or interesting on the level that men do. The rare ones exist, but that doesn't mean there's this huge group of them not getting the attention they deserve. Men are generally just better at the extreme things that require extreme physical and/or cognitive prowess. That's not to say there aren't women who aren't being treated poorly.
Men dominate the media, too, yes. That's true.

Rodney Mullen is probably my fave of all time. Mind = blown when watching him.
