Your argument is underdeveloped - I’m not arguing CERTAINTY, simply that simple Bayesian Inference would imply that that which has happened is more likely, again however slightly, than that which has not.  Like, we DO have 10 years of data, which is infinitely more than none at all.  
The “why” of it (what you’re naming “fundamentals”), while important and certainly useful, doesn’t negate that bit of logic.

The idea that Bitcoin has a higher chance of increasing by the exponent than decreasing by it (ie the probability is higher that it will double or triple instead of be halved or reduced to a third) is exactly right and something many people don’t entirely understand.
Even more importantly, Bitcoin is not something that will just sit and dither at 9700 forever.  It will either exponentially rise and be on par with other massive stores of value in terms of magnitude (say gold or real estate) or it will decay to nothing.
So given the first premise AND the second, the risk is far greater to stay out than to be in as time moves forward.

The US may not have a social safety net but it is consistently better for entrepreneurs than Canada.  There’s no limit to success in the US once you get it.  You can become a gazillionaire (at the sacrifice of tons of poorer people) in the US - that’s not nearly as true in Canada.
These idiotic backhanded envious comments from insecure Canadians on this issue come out repeatedly whenever the US is under a pseudo protectionist government.  Unfortunately for that particular argument, it’s not remotely borne out in data.

Yes plenty on Reddit have used it - including me.  The drawback is it pays monthly interest on the month from when you deposited that particular amount - so if you withdraw early, you lose that particular amount’s interest for that month.
Other than that it’s not terrible for holders (though probably garbage for day traders).  The business model is that they’re using it as collateral for loans - however those that receive loans themselves have to have some crypto collateral themselves.

Did you consider putting some of your Bitcoin in a BlockFi account (or some type of interest bearing account)?  Since you’re HODLing.
@_date: 2019-07-31 03:19:59
Not quite - history suggests that Bitcoin’s pattern is to exponentially rise, then exponentially fall, but, and this part is key, never to the point from which it initially rose.
In other words, it would 10X, but then never 1/10th itself.  By my cursory check, that pattern has repeated 3-4 times over the last 10 years.
Which means that Bayesian inference would suggest that it is more likely (however slightly) for Bitcoin to do as I mentioned than to do the opposite, since we have the above empirical data as a previously known given piece of information.

That’s a pretty inchoate analysis.

For the vast majority of these solutions (ie go by “satoshis”), the problem is that noobs will think “Satoshi” is a different coin from bitcoin.

Hmmm - I’m not sure I agree with your analysis - when corporate debt to gdp ratios hit certain highs in the last 30 years, a recession basically was either in effect or about to BE in effect.  That graph couldn’t be more clear, particularly during this generation of globalization.  You have to almost intentionally find reasons to ignore historically high ratios to make your claim.
In addition, when you read the Fed’s own report that was linked, they’re concerned that this debt is being financed by cheap money (instead of during the 80s, when rates were relatively sky high), mimicking the subprime mortgage scenario where shitty loans were given out because money was cheap.  So the debt, while being high historically, is even MORE concerning because it’s entirely likely that a greater share isn’t quality.
But I appreciate the back and forth - it’s always good to hear a debate using real numbers instead of complete hand wavy crap.

He’s saying because the last few times it’s happened in the US, a recession literally happened, particularly in modern times. And the corporate debt GDP ratio is the highest it’s ever been in the US.  And the Fed agrees with him.  What’s so confusing?  The US isn’t Sweden or Canada.  It’s a manifestly different economy.  Compared to ITSELF historically, it’s not healthy.

We use the “cent” for 1/100 of a dollar and that’s metric.....

Are you ignoring that guy’s last graph?  And if so, why?

This sounds insane but there’s a chance that the vast majority of wealth becomes denominated in Bitcoin, at least implicitly, precisely because Bitcoin is antifragile (that is, it benefits from any type of volatility, and over time, there will always be increasing volatility/entropy).
In that setting, given that the world’s total debt is like 276 trillion dollars, seeing Bitcoin sky to something like 10 million dollars is possible (though admittedly absurd sounding).  At that point, things would be valued in satoshis (so it would equal 10 cents) and that’s what you’d buy and use as currencies would be implicitly pegged to Sats much the way it was for gold.  I agree that then, the ROI would basically be stable, and you’ll probably use it as a base unit of wealth to trade for whatever you need then.
By the way, being able to hold a volatile asset as it moves upward is itself “good financial work ethic”.  Being still and patient isn’t the equivalent of doing nothing and being lazy.

Real adoption is when people start using it as a store of value for their final settlement layer.

They charge approximately 0.5 percent per trade if you factor in the higher price you’re buying.  Gemini charges around 0.35 percent per trade.
Say you use GUSD to trade for your BTC on the blockfi platform.  Because you earn 8.6 percent yearly on that (for now), if you wait something like 22 days, the interest you’ve received cancels out the elevated price you’re asked to pay for the convenience.  
In other words, the longer you hold and don’t trade, the more you make in interest, but in this fashion, they also incentivize that they have held collateral for loans, etc.  OTOH, if you HAVE to trade, you can do so, for approximately the fee of coinbase or regular non active trader Gemini, and they make a profit.
As an aside, you get no interest on coinbase or Gemini on your trading account.
In reality the fact that they charge a slightly higher price makes me feel BETTER because I understand how they can make a profit on this move and how customers can come out ahead should they choose to by sacrificing time and holding their deposit with them.

Uh, no?  I’ve just used it and had the same concerns as some people.

I think what I meant was that it wasn’t a “too good to be true” situation.  It makes sense to me that this model could work, and it makes sense that there would be such a cost.  
Note that the interest rates vary on the crypto you have - so if you’re trading ETH for BTC or something, then you’re likely getting 4.1 percent annually on your ETH, so you’d have to wait LONGER (like 45 days) in order to have enough interest to justify a full trade from ETH to BTC while saying it was “feeless”.

TBF, he was typing under duress from a bunker about to wage apocalyptic war, so it’s possible he got his dates slightly wrong.
