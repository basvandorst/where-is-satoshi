You bring up opportunity, which is a major reason a copy of bitcoin is unlikely to supplant the original. When choosing a currency to use, people will gravitate towards the option with the least opportunity cost. Of all currencies, US dollars have the least opportunity cost because they are accepted in the most places. In cryptocurrencies, that option is bitcoin by a large margin.

@_date: 2014-03-27 00:02:09
I trust the free market to make efficient social investments over the government. And given an unlimited power to create money there is a tendency for govt investments to be poorly allocated. Your example of bitcoin losing value in 2113 can also be applied to any money. And the history of fiat shows that the US $ will most likely do this. But on the other hand, cryptocurrency based on gold-like properties, not so certain.
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:25:28
Don't get me wrong, I luurve the altcoins. But reading countless comments that only say 'wow' or 'such amaze' or 'to the moon!' is growing tiresome. If the post's subject matter is serious (and with money it usually is) then add something of substance to your comment.
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:20:23
The fact that major news networks are even broadcasting the potential problems with bitcoin is a significant step. It means a larger portion of the population is drawn in to solve those issues. Besides, money is a very peculiar topic, only a fraction of a percent of people own btc. That means the majority's vested interest lies within an outside network such as fiat or gold. Take for example the disdain that some figures in the gold sector have shown bitcoin. Ideologically these networks are similar yet their participants are opposed due to their separate vested interests. At the end of the day the individuals who are forced to wipe their financial slate clean, via bankruptcy/economic disruption, will choose to rebuild around the soundest money available. At this moment that is bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-20 02:00:31
Great responses, I consider darkwallet to have the most real world use of any btc app to date. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:00:46
It *is* backed by the authentication and security that computing power provides the network. Going as far back as Alexander the Great, more than one authority had to accept a currency for it to be effective across borders. The government is one such authority, business' another. Just as gold was not governed by a single authority. The current reality of one authority (reserve bank) controlling the source of currency is a new and dangerous one.

No speculation is also a factor in any scarce environment. Over the past few months it is evident that bitcoin has a floor of US$500 or there abouts. The floor price would be a somewhat accurate mark of the value of bitcoin's businesses. Had there been no underlying assets then the price would have dropped much lower, if not to zero.

No, you mistake the origin of its value. The bitcoin unit itself is worthless until it is spent on goods/services/land/dollars etc. The 'price' of btc is a reflection of the goods and services that are currently tied to the network.

I see, so you're saying that strip away the human element from bitcoin and you're left with nothing but bits/atoms?

Yes, but it's important to realize that in monetary terms, purchasing dogecoin comes at the opportunity cost of purchasing bitcoin. When deciding whether to be earn altcoin or bitcoin, people will most likely choose the option with the least opportunity cost. At the moment that's bitcoin by a huge margin.

Don't get hooked up on the dollar figure of btc. At the level you're talking about, bitcoin's value will be defined by purchasing power and the amount/type of people that are in the network. Also alot of young people that lack substantial savings are within the bitcoin network and their earning/contributing potential will rise with age.

The best representative is the bitcoin users themselves. Maybe a Foundation based on a voting system validated by bitcoin is the most sustainable mechanism.

Or you could look at it through the eyes of the consumer. If bitcoin really is a more efficient payment system then goods priced in bitcoin should be somewhat cheaper, to convince the consumer to give up their coin. Classic supply and demand.

Ok, so Fractional Reserve Banking can work in theory, but it has faltered in practice due to dishonest players in the system on a large scale. Bitcoin will never allow for those dishonest players to repeat their mistakes. If you overextend your fractional reserve relative to capital, the market will realise and there will be no over-arching central authority (Fed) to bail you out.

As i understand, the intrinsic value of btc is relative to the amount of people using the network and exchanging between themselves. Energy input through computers will always be necessary to maintain the blockchain, as it will continue to increase as the network and number of transactions grows even after every bitcoin has been mined.  Mining is a brilliant mechanism that generates initial interest in maintaining the network. Come next century mining for a btc will be a distant memory and could be revered like a legend. By tying the energy dilemma to a value exchange medium like btc you ensure that everyone connected to the network will have a vested interest in developing an efficient energy source and increasing computational power. Imagine if the whole world was using btc and every single person could extend their wealth by creating technological and energy innovations. Tree huggers and techheads rejoice

BTC and torrent implications arose in my mind too. If cryptocurrency is fully adopted into mainstream, I'd expect media distributors to encrypt the original version of their products to be unlocked in conjunction with payment of bitcoin(or alt). Ironically if btc does take hold it could mean the eventual demise of the 'free' ride that we've had with 'pirating' movies/music.

My repost: "If Satoshi is indeed one person then I like to think he would wait until bitcoin is more entrenched in the free market (year/s from now) to make a move. If bitcoin is in the early stages of a revolution then volatility is expected in the short term. Once volatility has somewhat steadied then Satoshi can distribute a portion of his btc to counter any government attempts to regulate cryptocurrency. This works by essentially giving (at a discount or for free) a relative portion of btc to a group of people and watching as their new vested interest in the coin fuels its value. Bitcoin gains its value by the more people that have it. Satoshi and the early miners/buyers hold the key to countering any government/bank attempts to debunk btc's legitimacy."
As this thread suggests, Satoshi and all major bitcoin holders wield potentially devastating power over the long term, in the short to medium term expect the free market to weed out those that don't truly believe in this technology's potential and distribute their btc to those that do.

All verification processes put me off completely, and I'm not even a criminal. In future, consider purchasing through a forum like localbitcoins or some variant which allows trade purely between individuals, the way btc was designed.

if a network of people deem something to have a certain value than that thing will hold it's value within the network.

almost a combination of commodity and currency (scarcity and fluidity etc). I think of it as if it were a universal token, wherever you go tokens have a different value. The value of btc will reflect those that use it, just like a token

You're right it doesn't make sense to trust one person (or a select group) with these decisions, this is why the federal reserve and most fiat reserves do not work because human nature is too interested in self-benefit for the minority (bankers) to be in charge of money. However we must take into account the technology that satoshi has given us and how it reflects on his nature. Make no mistake Satoshi has the capability to devalue bitcoin by flooding the market in the short term but why would he want to see his brain-child be potentially destroyed so suddenly? For bitcoin to attain global currency status then Satoshi and the early miners/buyers will have to make moves to ensure its survival via re-distribution, which occurs naturally in a free market. I agree we should be very wary of Satoshi, but if he is who his open-source technology suggests, then I have hope he (and other major btc stakeholders) will do what is right from a libertarian standpoint.

If btc is successful, we should see an increase in computational power to match the increasing workload and it will only be viable over the long term (think decades) if we also make the power consumption more efficient. By the time mining finishes in 2140 we will probably see the market come to a solution as to how to maintain the block chain (some sort of transaction cost but far far smaller then banks today)
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:39:05
They'd simply up the tax rate (taxes may be collected much faster in a btc nation then in today's fiat ones). And if the populace truly feels their livelihood is threatened then they won't deny it. If war is on your doorstep history's shown that the populace can be easily motivated (i.e. pearl harbour), not so much for wars that don't directly protect the nation's livelihood (iraqi war). Also important to note that should a bitcoin nation go to war with another btc nation than it would be economically destructive to both their economies (and the network in general)

Downvoted for thinking a cartoon (generally exaggerated medium) that depicts an alternative viewpoint on today's monetary agenda should be shown in a school? Yes the JFK part was silly but kids today are ingrained from grade 1 to think that putting all their money in a bank is the only option.

Yes during the worst of the crash we'd possibly see a drop in BTC price as those affected cashed in their coins out of fear or to survive. As the market starts to put the pieces back together we'll see new people realizing the problems related to banking monopolies and debt funded govt spending. Those affected will search for a solution which may lead them to crypto currencies. So we'd potentially see btc's exponential rise on the back end of another global crash
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:27:54
That split is my very rough guesstimation. Gold is worth so much because it's been used as a currency/store of value for thousands of years across many civilisations. The material worth of gold as a metal if very different, there are equally as strong and durable metals to be used to make engines/armor/bullets/sinks/doorknobs etc that are far cheaper. Gold is more expensive than these metals because a large network of people place a high value ($) on it's scarcity and use it as a currency/commodity
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:39:31
I like this timeline, but i see a few issues. Yes, there would be intergenerational war in this scenario but throwing the elderly out of their apartments? Most elderly have children that would protect them. Nothing but sales tax? Welfare will always be needed even in a btc society, at least for the disabled. And, yes America will be a free nation again, but it will be hated on by almost every other nation for leading the world into the biggest financial scam in history. And nations don't trade with the people they hate.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:10:22
yes but modern economics shows us that a free market will distribute wealth appropriately regardless of who starts off with the most. In the case of the US, the marginally free market there does distribute wealth to a degree, but then the Fed prints/digitises more money for the government to use on their agenda and creates an imbalance that comes to the fore in the form of bubbles and crisis'. BTC is experiencing bubbles in the short term because it is dependant on the everyday user spending dollars to attain it. As I said, for bitcoin to be as successful as it could be, we can only trust Satoshi to re-distribute the majority of his wealth. I'd rather trust one person for a limited time than the people in charge of the fed for the rest of time.
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:03:02

It can be a problem if these early BTC adopters decide to fund private armies and wars, however war will be far harder to maintain than today's wars.

And as many have said the biggest threat is heavy government filtering of the internet.
