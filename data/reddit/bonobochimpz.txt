Bitstamp is an unacceptable method of trading fiat for BTC due to their identification requirements. Coinbase is superior (assuming you have a US bank account) because the only data required are email, password, and banking account/route details.
Bitcoinaverage does not provide the market price, but provides a "guess" as to what the global market price might be.

This is what I would actually have to pay to buy/sell BTC and includes all fees. This is using my API credentials.

I have never used those platforms before, but I'll certainly look into it!

The point of this application is that this information is not a guess.

* This is the real price you'll pay to trade, right now. This is actually the "market price" and not a guess
* The quote is in USD only because that's the only currency Coinbase supports
* The quotes are updated every 60 seconds automatically, since that's how often Coinbase updates their quotes
* There is no tracking software (not even analytics), bloatware or malware
* There is an address at the bottom for small donations as appropriate
* You can leave the page's tab open and see the current price to buy BTC just by looking at the tab
* Let me know if you'd like the PHP file I made, I'll send it to you!

I only wanted to see the buy price on the tab, and did not want to have to click on a tab that says "Bitcoin Charts" for the latest price information. 
I also am not concerned with the historical exchange rate of BTC to fiat, which is meaningless, so no need for a chart. And I did not want to install any plugins that might be malicious.

I actually did make the switch to Android precisely because I could get Coinbase's app. Others will too. The hardware and software aren't nearly as good, and I pissed off a lot of friends/family that were used to contacting me via iMessage but it doesn't matter - I need to have a mobile BTC wallet and a way to pay people while I travel.

Interesting, thanks for the tip on Mycelium. I never keep anything more than pocket change in Coinbase for exactly the reason you mention - I will buy from them but immediately move my coins out of there, I just don't trust any online wallet service.

I'm not sure I understand completely - I'm heavily into BTC but am still new and don't understand everything perfectly yet. If my wallet address is, for example, 1Mexample1 (containing 1BTC), and I send .25BTC to 1Mexample2, then the remaining .75BTC in 1Mexample1 goes to a newly generated address - and that is then immediately re-routed back into 1Mexample1?

Thanks for (re)posting this, it certainly helps clarify what is going on for those of us in the west. I'm very glad to hear that BTC is all systems go in China!

Excellent concept, I've seen you post on Reddit before (I believe it was an AMA) and I'm glad to hear you're having success with Honey. This might be an excellent way to monetize Honey in the near-term, I would certainly use it for all of my normal Amazon purchases as long as it doesn't require any sign-up or personal details - I would highly recommend to friends and family as well.

Yes, I reset the block chain multiple times on both machines (the sending laptop and receiving laptop). We were using identical hardware (Macbook Airs) and software (TrueCrypt and Multibit), so I think it had to be an issue with our bogged-down wifi network - it was completely unsecured and was seeing heavy traffic. 
It is reassuring to know that that "change" won't ever be lost, thanks.

It is possible but not probable. In spite of all the regulation, this is still a free country and we are free to participate in commerce however we see fit. There are certain exceptions (i.e. commerce controls regarding trade with a few other nations on national security grounds), but in general commerce and technology is unrestricted - see the internet. 
Investment instruments (including vehicles for investing in BTC I'm sure) are a different case - those are regulated because people were getting scammed on the regular.
