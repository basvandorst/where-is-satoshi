But companies are inherently hierarchical just like corporations, which anarchists are opposed to just as much as the state.

No, these guys are definitely not protesting crony capitalism, they're anarchists and want to see the abolition of capitalism.

We haven't said a single thing about capitalism, there isn't anything for you to deduce what my "misconceptions" are. We have, however, talked at length about socialism, and it is quite obvious you have no idea what it is. [Read this]( to clear up your misunderstanding that socialism requires dictatorship.

Anarchists do not like hierarchy in any form, so they would abolish the state and the corporations, and in this case abolish more accurately means dismantle.

You seem to have a lot of misconceptions about what socialism is and isn't. They aren't advocates for the Soviet Union, and almost every socialist today sees the USSR as a state capitalists dictatorship. Many of these peoples also don't want to remove risks from their lives either, they just want what they see as the full value of their labor (they believe wages are unfair because they don't receive the full value of their labor) and also ensure everyone receives at least the basic necessities to live. A common saying among them is "From each according to their ability, to each according to their need." Many of them view work as a good and commendable thing, they just want the work to benefit them and their peers rather than the rich few. A far cry from what the Bolshevik party leaders did in the thirst for power, namely Stalin.

I think you are confused about the nature of socialist groups like these hackers. Their goal isn't to destroy capital, but capitalism. They aren't just going to be walking down the street tearing down every building, destroying all the crops, etc. Their goal is however to distribute the products of society in a different manner than we do today. While it is true many socialists oppose currency, (although Market Socialists embrace it) they also see it as necessary for life under a capitalistic system. It is not hypocritical for a socialist worker to use currency in the same way it was not hypocritical for a feudal peasant to work the crops.

Again, you have a lot of misconceptions about what socialism is. I would recommend you read a little about it, you might be surprised by what you see.

They may not be a ruler, but it is most certainly a form of hierarchy. A capitalist relies on the fact that you need a wage to survive to coerce their workers into working for less than the value of their labor.


This is a AnCap idea, not a principle anarchists follow. AnCap =/= Anarchist.
