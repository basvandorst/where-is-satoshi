hartz4 is a social payment beyond the unemploymentpayment you get from unemploymentassurance wich will stop payments lates after one year out of work...formally hartz 4 was socialaid...after a reform in...the early 2000ths??? a guy invented Hartz4 as something that is called a donation of the state, and ment as an " motivation" to find a job. It is set together of your living costs ( rent water, heating) and your personal needs( about 380€) p.p.p.m. . The authority regulating this is incharge to ask you to do any business to get your own living expences. No matter if it is under your qualifications, includes workintimes not to handle by you, or anything else...so...kind of modern stately slavery

To those who claim, lieferservice.de had not the best deliveryservices, and so on...did ya all realise...lieferando integrated them? Nothing had been sorted out
And..Yes...UI had been buggy sometimes...but...it had a Bitcoinintegration...top that
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:02:18
One more update:
I'm now sending them the link to this redditpost frequently...kind of once an hour

FU*****, We ordered there very often using BTC.
They lost some customers, now
Update: I just wrote customerservices and became this reply:
" Guten Tag,
vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht.
Es ist in der Tat so, dass es seit ein paar Tagen nicht mehr möglich ist mit Bitcoins zu bezahlen, da Lieferservice seit ein paar Tagen direkt zu Lieferando weiterleitet.
Da Sie nicht der einzige Kunde sind, der sich diesbezüglich bei uns gemeldet hat, ist die entsprechende Abteilung darüber schon informiert worden.
Wir können Ihnen jedoch leider noch nicht sagen, ob und wann es denn dann möglich sein würde, mit Bitcoins auf unserem Portal bezahlen zu können.
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,"
Short translation:
They agreed not accepting BTC anymore, but mentioned several complains about this and are on their way to deside accepting BTC again or not. 
So everybody: Write to them via their onlineform and ask for paying with BTC!
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:57:44
I'm not sure if answers to the sender are receiving anyone... but I try to translate:
thanks for your message, Unfortunatly we ourselves have no information wether this paymentoption will be available again or when. Due to Bitcoins are a highly accepted paymentmethod, it sure will be in our focus. In Austra, Swiss an Netherlands still it is available. Unfortunately not in Germany due to the change to the systems of Lieferando. The people in charge of this ar informed in any way and hope to get information as soon as possible, how we handle this in future

@_date: 2014-11-28 14:10:08
Yep...just a blank, white page without content
@_date: 2014-12-11 08:46:22
Seems like. So we here have to wait a little longer. By the way, the German Expedia-page still doesn't accept BTC as well.
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:42:50
Thanks for this and have an upvote ;-)

If you did read my post carefully you see, that I used that post only as an exsample...bad luck for for the editor but I adressed my post to all the people who did expect something unexpectable. That's why I wrote a new post instead of commenting a single one.
besides: I'm not hunting for upvotes or attraction or something else. I just say my oppinion in an open forum...freedom of speech..
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:01:19
I don't agree. If the Userinterface is easy to use, nobody needs to count the change or calculating....
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:42:45
They just printed the Baht Price twice ;-) 
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:31:24
A little bit more by that time. Price was about $ 223 on 23/01
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:37:31

Last week we went to Pattaya Beergarden at the south end of Beach Road close to Walking Street.
We already heard they take BTC for food and drinks...quite a convincing experience when we ordered the bill and a clerk presented us a tablet with QR code. One scan with the Mycelium App on my friends smartphone, and we were ready to leave.... this was the fastest way to pay I ever saw in a real location.
I often order Pizza in Germany via Lieferservice.de with BTC, but thats in the Internet. Paying in a Restaurant for food and a jug of beer was really exciting.
Everybody visiting Pattaya should also have some drink and / or food there to support their efforts to bring more acceptance to BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-29 06:51:53
We gave the tip in cash
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:57:32
I did...but it sometimes takes some time to get the change.... and if you ever saw some folks laying down their choise at the cashier, waiting until everything is scanned and charged...then taking out their wallets, searching at a bill of 17,99 if they find some coins to pay without getting change...takes hours... cash isn't that fast
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:09:48
You still can find it under the markets-tab on top of the page
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:38:55
it's very expensive for Thailand and Pattaya...we just went there because aof BTC-Acceptance...normaly we go to normal kitchens...and there are prices normal, even in Pattaya

I'm not interrested in ladyboys.... ;-) 
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:25:11
not by myselves....of course the restaurant could send the money back to my mycelium key

@ bitcornhole: By commenting my post in this way you just do the same as you think I did....think it over what you said: " Anyone can post anything to reddit"
Anybody who posts here must expect reactions...so what? Want a censor for reddit?
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:27:37
They presented us a tablet with the QR on it. I don't know, what App they used.
@_date: 2016-07-10 07:38:18
nice shot!
