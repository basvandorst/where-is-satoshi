Yes, very few people lose bitcoins from mobile phones...unless they don't care about the bitcoins (I give away probably $50 or more a year in $1 increments to tons of random people... my guess is many get new phones and forget about their $1).
We still have a way to go, but our newer smart phone wallets aps and paper wallets are very easy to use for those with a TINY modicum of experience with them.

If you want to try Bitcoin, why not just add a phone wallet?  There are so many reputable wallets for smartphones for both Apple and Adroid.
Airbitz, coPay, Bread Wallet, Mycelium (android only). etc.

Oh, the sitcom.  Some will think not.  Some will think so.  The artists set their own prices.
And 21 cents too expensive?
@_date: 2016-08-20 23:17:34
Instant payment, storage, some of the wallets have additional add-ons (gift cards, peer to peer market, multisig).  
OP said he was just getting started.... wouldn't one of these be better than downloading the entire blockchain and have a better UX for a noob?

Bitcoin is completely fine for corner stores and coffee sales right now. I buy coffee all the time at Adirondack Coffee in Nisswa, MN.  The just use the Airbitz wallet on an iPad and they can handle as many transactions per minute as there are customers using Bitcoin. This is because they don't wait for a ten-minute confirmation. There's no reason to do that for a coffee sale or anything under $10. The customer pays the miner fee and the customer usually is aware of that (Mycelium economic fee is 2 cents).
 This narrative that Bitcoin isn't ready for prime time, is too scary to use, is not safe, that people are uncertain and scared of it is just ridiculous and has to change. It's the easiest thing in the world to use everyone knows how to use smartphone apps.

Use Jaxx wallet, buy ltc, eth, or Dash from within the wallet.  Turn back to btc, from within the wallet, send to uncle.  Airgap is the best way.
Or have Uncle get Jaxx.  You trade btc for dash, send dash to uncle, uncle buys btc with his dash.

How would you know?  He is a former IT professional and early programmer.  He's been following btc for years...I was the first to help over the line and finally adopt it.  That being said, I've also helped the Adirondak Coffee House in Nisswa, MN.  They started taking and holding their btc for the last 2 years.  The owner is NOT a computer person, but she is thrilled they started taking btc.  All of her employees have mobile wallets for tips.  Because the spender of btc pays the miner fee, she likes it better than credit cards.

Of course not.  ☺ worrying about a double spend for under $5 (or really under $100) is really over kill.  Really really overkill.  Plus she is a psychologist, not a hacker or computer person of any kind.  David Duccini was with us too, HE might be able to pull off a double spend, but it is soooooo not worth it for such small amounts.  Merchants should have no fear of using Bitcoin for retail sales.

Reach into your back pocket, grabbing your wallet (or for ladies, lifting up purse, opening purse, search for pocket book), opening the wallet, finding the right size bill, handing that to the cashier, making the cashier make change, waiting for chsnge, takes about the same amount of time as opening your phone wallet and scanning a QR code.

You can set your price in btc, as low as 10 cents, make sure you market your videos to your existing YouTube fan base and to other bitcoiners. Added bonus, you can split with a charity or anyone else--maybe that charity would pimp your videos too.  
You should still use YouTube too.  One model is to release a new video 5 days on WMB, then move it to YT for free.  Another idea is to release a preview on YT and the full video on WMB.

Regardless of his disagreement over how to scale, I am forever grateful to Roger (and Erik and Charlie) for helping me get my 1st mobile wallet in 2011, also to Gavin for taking the time to meet up and explain btc to Mark and Ian of radio show FreeTalkLive where I and literally millions of people first heard about Bitcoin.  Roger bought advertising time on their network plus paid for a Bitcoin billboard on the largest freeway in Silicon Valley for years.  
Today I give away close to $100/year to bitcoin noobs (tipped over $25 to 2 waitresses at the hotel I stayed at this week in Milwaukee.

Yes, SegWit addresses (starting with 3) are compatible with non Segwit addresses (starting with 1).  This was why core wanted a softfork so all addresses are backwards compatible.

 **Crypto Kids Camp** is the first ever week long Summer Camp for children ages 5-17.   Bye Bye S.T.E.M/S.T.E.A.M......Hello B.E.A.S.T. M.O.D.E.   For an entire week we will be teaching children the 21st century technology:  Blockchain, Engineering(Robots), Artificial Intelligence,  Science(Virtual Reality), Technology(Coding), and Mining, Online Gaming, D-Apps, Evolution of Money.   Camp is from July 15-19 from 8am to 5pm.   
Your donation will specifically be going towards us purchasing:   
1) A Lap Top Computer for every child  
2) A Smart Phone for every child  
3) Materials for the children to build a Sky Mining Rig  
4) Materials for the children to build a drone  
5) Virtual Reality Equipment  
6) Teacher &amp; TA Stipend   
7)  A Healthy Lunch Each Day for the children (2 Meatless Days)   
Your support will enable us to provide the best technology for children and give them an opportunity to get ahead of the "Crypto and Blockchain Curve". Our children here in the United States and specifically the inner city are educationally and technology challenged. Our schools have never taught about MONEY and how it works which is a fundamental pillar.  They don't teach entrepreneurship because they want us to be employees our entire lives.  Our children deserve to get the right foundation so they can sit at the Worldwide Table and compete.  The world of Crypto and Blockchain is in full swing and this is our opportunity to do something big that will forever change the face of our families.   
Please assist us on the Mission for Education and Mass Adoption.

No.  Fees are part of the protocol.  Every time anyone sends a Tx a fee is paid to the same miner who solves the block and gets the (currently) 12.5 btc subsidy.
Fees are currently calculated depending on the (data) size of Tx (not amount of the payment)

Apple pay requires a signature for any purchase above $50 in the US.  And I didn't want to buy anything, I sent money to a business.  IF (and I don't know that they do) Apple allows biz to biz transfers my guess it their limits would be very low.   
But also Venmo and Apple Pay requires one to: 
1.  Have a bank account (excludes 25% of the US population), 
2. Own an Apple phone (excludes 55% of the population who have smartphones, and countless other who don't) 
3.  Can still have charge-backs since they're basically a credit cards
Venmo and Apple Pay do nothing close to what Bitcoin does

WatchMyBit is not a porn site, but we allow artistic nudity, which is exactly what Peter McEvilley's latest video showcases.
The producer is splitting the payment with the gorgeous, Italian actress, and implementing a descending payment schedule, one of the interesting models that WatchMyBit creates.
For the 1st week, the exclusive video will cost $1.39 in bitcoin, dropping to $.99 the 2nd week, and 69 cents the  3rd week.
The video of the original song Analog is from Peter's latest album.
The Los Angeles artist has been very impressed by the money he sees coming in from his film On Falling which is exclusively on WatchMyBit, he is talking to his network of film and video producer friends!  He sees WatchMyBit as a place for independent films and pilots that were never picked up to have a life and actually earn money for their creators.   This is the start of Bitcoin moving in to Hollywood so please watch and share with your friends and help the evolution!

By 'sell' you mean 'trade BTC for some other money so that you can buy stuff with it'?

No need to sell, just buy stuff with it.

Not sure what you are saying?  We allow our artists to set their own prices.  We don't control the pricing. So if an artist has the price " too high" then that is their issue and they should follow the market and drop their price, to as low as $0.09. We do have a lot of other content up there that is much longer, for example the sitcom with Danny Trejo is 23 minutes and is only $0.21. Plus John Bush's Sovereign Living episodes are all up there for $0.99.
 Our business model is to allow every artist be their own content creator and therefore, deploy  their own business model!  😊

Dude, nobody can read the market. Many many many people are in your same position. There is not some sort of skill that allows you to figure out dips and Rises. Don't think there are some people out there who can time the market perfectly, a few approach really good, but it takes years of research and watching and learning. Luckily with Bitcoin you're one of the very few markets that tends to go up all the time, even though there are Corrections and newbies freak out.

I Risked thousands of dollars on an un-proven, never before heard of distributed ledger.  That is not nothing.  It gave those exchanges and businesses where I bought my mostly under $100 bitcoin profit and capital to further innovate and try new things.  Yes some failed, and some succeeded.  But the fiat I invested also acted as a signal to other developers and investors to do further investment and innovation.  This is an engine that many do not understand, but nevertheless is powerful.  
Oh, I have also spent well more then half of my original sub $100 bitcoins on MANY things, but buying and holding sends price discovery signals to others that says 'hey, these bitcoin things might have some value...'

Hi Victoria.  I'm a founder of   One use I see for tipping is to get bitcoins into the hands of people who want to watch videos on our platform (It's a video paywall service).  I'm wondering if there is a way to incorporate ChangTip directly on our platform.  Something like 'need bitcoins to watch a video? Go to  and ask for some tips".  That is sort of begging for tips, but it might drive bitcoin adoption if you set up a place where people can just out right beg for tips.  
Just an idea.
We would like to continue to find ways to support any new technology like ChangeTip.  Thanks!

Thanks for your suggestions.  But we don't want to really 'hold' peoples bitcoins...that might make us a target for theft.   THat being said, we have considered the account idea.  Or we may team up with a rewards program. 
This platform is different and new...yes, people are used to getting video for free, so this won't appeal to everyone.  Think of it as a crowd-funding site too.  If a band puts up a video, their super fans would probably watch it knowing the funds will go to their next album or put them on tour.  
Plus we have a long way to go until bitcoins are really popular.
So, we know this might only take off in the bitcoin community for a while.

It looks like you missed understand the concept of human rights. You're asking from whose authority a right comes from. Human Rights exist because we are human. They are innate, unalienable.   Rights  aren't granted by governments or men.  They can and should  defended by governments and men  (laws) , but can't   be  taken away  by governments (they  try and often succeed in suppressing people,  but   human rights are never gone,  just suppressed)

I'm a founder of a new video platform that works perfectly for bands on several levels.   Check out  
You could upload a live video, charge 15 cents in btc to watch it, automatically split the coins with each member, or put it all towards your album fund.   
Promote the video to your super fans and ask them to send it to all their friends.  It's like YouTube but with a btc paywall, and  It acts as an organic  crowd funding platform too (and an instant  contract with the rest of the  band members).   You can even split with a charity and ask them to promote it to their supporters. 
If your fans don't have Bitcoin you could sell it to them at your live shows. 
We are in closed beta now, but open beta for viewers starts a week from Monday.

Did the people who bought Rearden metal do nothing?  No, they bought a commodity from the inventor, giving that commodity a real value... even if they bought a bunch of the metal and didn't build anything with it, that purchase was a signal to the market that 'this thing has value'.  It's not as sexy as the original invention...but it was a risk to buy something that was untested an untried.  That is incredibly valuable.

��  actually the address changes every time you use it. Rather you get a new address every time you send or receive Bitcoin. You can use the same address over and over again but it is not recommended. Your wallet will keep track of the total amount of Bitcoins stored in it, plus it'll keep track of all the private and public key pairs. It's really a lot easier and intuitive then it might seem when being described using words. In fact,  test it out just transfer .01 bitcoins

Turn on 2 factor authentication, and do the password recovery questions.  SUPER IMPORTANT.  There is no way for Airbitz to 'reset' your password.  This is another consequence of being responsible for your own money and not using 3rd party middle men to hold your money.
But it is a good trade off.

They ARE still there, all addresses are managed by your wallet.  It's just that the wallet generates NEW addresses each time one is used.  The balance of ALL the addresses ever used in your Airbitz Wallet will be shown.  You don't have to figure out which address has how much, it's just all figured out for you.  Even when you send BTC, the wallet will automatically pull from your keys and tally up the amount you are sending.

My first customer was Mark Edge from Free Talk live, Eric Voorhees, walked him through the transfer at my stand.   
Periodically I would take the fiat and buy more btc  from the three wise men over those lucrative weekends in New Hampshire.

It is new technology and an asset class that hasn't existed before (is it gold? a stock? a currency? a platform?  -- it's all of these things!).  The internet was around 20 years before grandmas and everyone started using it.  It also is not controlled or regulated the traditional 'old fashioned' way using governments and politicians.  BTC is regulated by math and computers, no need for old fashioned 'control' -- it's controlled by all of us.  It is very new is basically the answer... smart wealthy people and early adopters ARE investing in it.

Yes, there is a Mycelium for iOS....it is no longer supported by Mycelium.  I know Rassah, he explained it.  They built the Android version of their wallet, and then they hired someone else to build an iOS version.

They will be releasing an iOS version with lots of new bells and whistles in the next several months but right now they are really an Android only platform. And I love Mycelium too.

Here's an idea.   Use beta.Watchmybit.com to upload previews, interviews, extra footage, behind the scenes stuff.   Charge 68 cents.   WatchMyBit can be used as crowd funding platform,  the 'premium'  supporters get is the exclusive video content.   We pass 75% Of bitcoin earned to the artists,  you  could also post the first 10 minutes of the film to beta.Watchmybit.com and charge something like $9 (or Euros), and let fans know that by watching and sharing the link, they are helping to fund the next segment, or post production.... You could release another 10 minutes a month later.... Move the first 10 minutes to YouTube and add an ending explaining where people can see the next 10 minutes  (WatchMyBit), repeat until all funds are collected.

Technically if anyone is holding your money, it's not yours...it's out of your control.  This is called a custodial account. It means someone else is the custodian of your funds. You have to trust them with your money that they won't steal it, lose it, get hacked, etcetera. I know it seems like in certain places Banks are supposed to be super safe. And in the Western World they are safer other countries. But still, nothing is a safe your own money under your own control. This means you have to be responsible for it.  But it is actually yours and you can prove it, and no third party can take it, lose it, give it to a government or anyone else.
I would suggest getting a wallet on your phone. If iOS,  Airbitz, if Android Airbitz or Mycelium.

Bitstamp is part of the "bitcoin system" in the same way that MoneyGram is part of the "dollar system".  But if MoneyGram was hacked, you wouldn't say 'the US dollar has been compromised and is not safe', you would simply use another service.   Visa and Mastercard are part of the 'credit' system, and when Target was hacked, no one questioned whether or not Visa and Mastercard were still trusted ... this is regardless of any insurance, there are many exchanges in the world, Bitstamp was just one of them.

For one night we got a restaurant/bar to accept bitcoins in Minneapolis.  
The biggest problem was the owner used the smallest Android smartphone and in the dim lights and with the tiny touch screen buttons the bartenders HATED it.
ALSO, tips are an issue.  On that one night I made it a point to all in our meet up that they should tip in cash, pay with bitcoin so the bartenders didn't get ripped off.  It is bad form for wait staff to remind customers to tip...and the bartenders didn't want their tips in bitcoin at that time--so figure out something for tips.  
I know a restaurant/bar owner in Madison would just figure out the tip from the payment and pay the waitstaff with cash a the end of the night.

You are correct.
Many companies list the price in dollars (or local currency) and behind the scenes, the price of bitcoin adjusts in real time.  That is the way we do it at

Just note, that when you SELL your btc you are responsible to report 20% capital gains if you made money and you held the btc for less then a year.  If more than a year, you are responsible to report 15% capital gains.  This is for US users only.
But, if you want to trade like this, do NOT do it with Coinbase to-from your bank account.  Use GDAX, which is Coinbases exchange.  Much faster, instant.

I just made this reply in an earlier post.  Here is a good idea as intro to the topic if nothing else.
A really great and fun practical demo to show the class is to pull up  and launch a video with $0.09 or 16 cents. So much easier to explain micropayments, QR codes, instant payments, the network listening, worldwide payments, and so many more things.
Of course the actual video you launch is irrelevant, in fact you should launch several videos. Have a student who recently downloaded a wallet launch a video.
In fact, I will provide every person in the class with $0.50 of Bitcoin. Be happy to help out anyway I can. Download a wallet, send a Bitcoin address to my email ( tell me what time and I will be standing by), &amp; I will zap them $0.50 right away. A half hour later, bring up our site and have them launch videos.
Feel free to PM me.

Poloniex, Coinbase, etc are custodial accounts.  You don't own or control the keys.   If they go away, you have lost control of any btc they were holding for you.  Phone wallets, paper wallets, hardware wallets, you control the private keys and can make backups and other security methods.

@_date: 2017-03-01 19:38:19
They are not unreliable. But they are a custodial Bank. This means they own your Bitcoin because you don't control them. A phone wallet or a paper wallet means you own and control the private keys. This is just best practices. It's fine to buy Bitcoin on coinbase, but move them to a device or wallet you control the private keys.

Yes because you bought on a regulated exchange using banks...banks take 5 to 7 days....not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-25 04:48:19
Yes, what we mean is that because bitcoin is a worldwide currency, that means people don't need bank accounts or PayPal to use Bitcoin and therefore watch your videos. Right now, PayPal and Google and Apple pay and any subscription service requires credit cards, credit cards are a very western phenomenon. Basically there 2 billion adults who have Western lives, with jobs and houses and stuff, but don't have bank accounts. Yet they have smart phones and internet connections. These people can become your new audience, an audience that cannot use traditional streaming pay services.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:44:08
That's true for all btc ever.  It is all an entry in a ledger (the blockchain).   Having the private keys means you control when those btc move from an entry signifying your wallet to an entry signifying someone else's wallet.   With custodial services like Coinbase, they control the private keys and you ask them to move the bitcoin.

Be sure to socialize out to your fans what You Are doing and let them know by watching it for 17 cents (or whatever) they are heping you a lot.  You can still ask for tips and get some ad revenue when you add the video to YouTube (you can keep your videos on both platforms!)

If you produce video content you can publish it WatchMyBit.com.  You'll have to socialize your videos out and make something people will want to watch.  You can charge as low as 9 cents.  
Or if you know people who make content, you can help them get bitcoin wallets on their phones, and help them with WMB.  You can split yourself in for whatever you want as long as they agree, kind of like being an agent.

Correct!  If you received 0.1 BTC on 10 different addresses, all managed by your Airbitz wallet, then you could spend ONE full BTC no problem.  This is true for most modern day wallets.  This generally is called Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets.  It was kind of cool 'breakthrough' a few years ago that greatly improved privacy.  If you use just ONE address and have 10 people send you small amounts, then all 10 of those people can see how much have in your wallet (with only one address).

The above is also what you need to do to open a bank account, get a credit card, open a brokerage account, send money through Western Union or Money gram.
Bitcoins are more than things you buy online like games or other software....they are a currency, a commodity, a stock (that you can short) all at the same time.  Bitcoins are a new kind of financial instrument.   Like other posters have suggestes, you need to expand your idea of what you are "buying".

One way around this, work with existing content creators and help them use WMB, then take a cut for walking them through this (getting a btc wallet, uploading to WatchMyBit), in effect, you would be an 'agent'.  WMB allows unlimited splitting, so every time someone watches a video, you would get some percentage (that you agree with with the content creator).  Here is a video that explains it better:

Try to stay in Bitcoin as much as you can.  That will help greatly.  You can buy giftcards from hundreds of places for restaurants, grocery stores (Whole Foods, Target), Amazon, AMC theaters with the Gyft app.... there are fewer reasons to ever sell into fiat.

My experience is completely different. I spend Bitcoins all over the place at many of those two hundred or so gift card places. Also I just bought a ton of computer stuff on NewEgg. It's very easy for me to find places to spend Bitcoin. I think of it as more a store of value than a currency which gives it even more value in my opinion.

Bitcoin hadn't been defined by the IRS and barely the SEC when Bitinstant began helping people buy bitcoins.  That some people money launder with whatever tools they have at their disposal doesn't mean Charlie approved of it any more than Ross Ulbricht approved of shooting up heroin.  Those who provide tools for anyone to use should not be held responsible for those who use those tools to break laws.  To think otherwise would mean you would support Home Depot being responsible for a murder committed using a hammer someone bought at thier store, and also every internet provider would be responsible for every download of Game of Thrones with any tool other than HBO Go.

Compare the Bitcoin network to the legacy fiat network.  Include every bank building and skyscraper and their construction costs, the operation of the Federal Reserve (and every other countries equivalent), all bank employees and their cars and commuting time, and so many more factors, all just to "secure" the fiat money system worldwide.  Bitcoin does this with many fewer resources.

Fractional Reserve Banking System Power Consumption

Add the cost of all the cars all the bank employees drive to and from work each day.
Add up the costs of all the operations of the Federal Reserve in each state and DC and each countries equivalent, include the cost of building and operating and maintaining all of those giant buildings.
Add every armored car, atm, the programmers for the atms, and every other employee, contractor, subcontractor, executive etc etc etc etc

Most think the price will be less volatile because there are more people shorting and arbatraging so the market calms because there is profit to be made in both a rising price and a falling price.  A few hundred dollars change in price could sound like a lot, but as the price rises it becomes a smaller and smaller percentage. Not like the old days when a couple hundred dollars rise or fall was a hundred percent change!
This recent drop maxed at 11% for a few minutes now sits at about 5%.

I sure hope you are only doing this to sell BTC and not store it.  Also, why not just buy gift cards through Gyft instead of using Coinbase and then bank account.  With Gyft you can by cards to Whole Foods and Target (for groceries), Amazon, tons of restaurants, Home Depot etc.

 for such a small amount, you could just hold it on a phone app (move purchased coins from Coinbase to a phone wallet like Airbitz, Jaxx, Bread etc). It's technically safer than a Windows machine running electrum because there are fewer attack vectors, Windows has a ton.

Don't keep adding BTC to one paper wallet.  Make many paper wallets at  and wait for larger amounts to accumulate wherever you buy and do ONE deposit per address on paper.  This is to avoid exposing your public key over and over online.  Eventually your one paper wallet may be a target for hackers.  Just best practices.

Yes, we have had those discussions.  But we want to be a Bitcoin facing, Bitcoin using site for general understanding in the general public, not the Bitcoin public. Bitcoin is more well-known.

Yes, almost completely.  To figure out who you are they would have to know all kinds of things like your IP address and try to figure out stuff like that. It depends on how secure you are with your phone in everyday use. It is extremely rare that people can steal your Bitcoins from phones.

Arbitrage is actually very difficult. Because if you sell Bitcoin on one exchange you now have fiat currency in dollars or Yen or pounds. Now, to get those dollars yen or pounds into another Exchange in another country to buy cheaper Bitcoin takes days and requires expensive wires and often is held up through regulation and bureaucracy. Arbitrage is not that easy to do quickly.

The issues isn't crypto currencies, those are super easy to move in seconds with no barriers and can be traded amonst each other without switching exchanges.  You are talking about the dollar price differences between, for example, BTC-e and Bitstamp.  Right now BTC-e price is $864, Bitstamp is $915.  so if you SELL Bitcoin on Bitstamp you will get dollars.  How do you get those dollars to BTC-e to re-buy Bitcoin for $864?

Local Bitcoins (.com).
Mycelium Android wallet has a local trader feature.
With these, you would meet a seller in public place and bring your cash (there are other ways to do it without meeting).
Airbitz wallet (iOs and Android), and Mycelium (android only), have 3rd party plugins that tie to a bank account (Glidera).
Buy it from an exchange like Coinbase (you will have to give up personal info and attach a bank account like paypal), then move it to a phone app or paper wallet.

Checks were greeted with the same skeptism, "what? Because this piece of paper says your bank will give the amount of money on it I'm supposed to believe you?".  Same with credit cards.  They came out in the 50s but didn't take off until the late 70s or early 80s--that's 30 to 40 years!  We are still in the early days friends.

Use whatever money you would have bought on miners and spend it on bitcoins directly.  Hold.  Or spend.
This will be a much better rate of return.

So, I guess we can assure you, it's easy.  Don't make it complicated.  Don't worry.If you want to get into how it works, why it works, the philosophies of Bitcoin etc, then you can look under the hood.

Download the Edge wallet to your phone (I've been around since 2011, I've used and still use a LOT of wallets over the years, Edge is pretty good for noobs).  WRITE down (do not screen capture) the user name, password, and pin.  There is no password reset, you are  your own bank.  Turn on two factor authenticationi, and if you aquire more than $XXX (whatever you feel is important) go through the password recovery process
In the wallet there is a way to buy BTC (the wallet doesn't require any personal info,   But to buy, those 3rd party plugins do).
Or you could find the nearest crypto ATM  [
You can also sign up with a custodial service to buy like [Coinbase.com]( BUT if you buy any coins on a custodial service, MOVE them to a wallet you control (Like Edge).

It was the Chrome extension on Windows that was the potential issue (and only potential, I don't think there were any hacks, just a story somewhere about a possibility).  Jaxx on phones totally fine.  No reason to stay away.
@_date: 2016-12-02 23:06:46
Because they can.
Same reason there are many kinds of cereal and granola.  The creators of the newer coins are adding new 'flavors' and 'ingredients' to appeal to different kinds of people.
Some will taste like crap, some will become popular, you might like one kind, but I might like another.  Some will have a lot of advertising and marketing dollars behind them.  Some will accidentally break (taste like crap or even be poison), some will purposely be broken and try to make money for a while.  etc etc etc.

 \~Adapted from the hilarious screenplay!\~  
Mark, a twenty-something software developer, forgets the most important rule of relationships, causing the love of his life to end it all. He’s amazed when he wins her back with an open and honest apology letter.  
After hearing this story, his best friend and fellow coder speculates that Mark’s letter may have cracked the code of human emotions. This leads the pair to anonymously sell their letters using bitcoin to others who just can’t seem to find the right words.  
Before long, their site, WriteIt4Me.com, has taken off. When news reporters start to question who is behind these mysterious letters that can mend a broken relationship, deliver the perfect wedding toast, or even eulogize your dearly departed Aunt Millie, their digital lives start to threaten their real lives. Throw in a vindictive hacker and the chaos is splattered all over social media.

How much energy does the current monetary system require? Think of all the bank buildings and their cost in energy every season for heating and cooling. Think of how much energy it took to build those buildings. Think of all the employees driving in cars on freeways to and from work. Think of all the armored cars and other tertiary businesses that Banks require. Now think of those giant Federal Reserve buildings in every state, and all of their bureaucrats and employees that go to and from these giant buildings every day, think about the u.s. mint and all of the machinery and associated agencies across the country required to support the minting of paper and coin money. Now multiply that by every country. In the world. Bitcoin is probably way more energy efficient and I haven't even factored in credit card companies and all their buildings, employees, server farms, etc.

Both of you should also download a phone wallet where you control the private keys.  The Coinbase app is NOT such a wallet (though you can certainly use it for your Coinbase acct)
After you buy on Coinbase, transfer your BTC to your phone wallets.  I like Airbitz (soon to be renamed Edge).  Jaxx is a good multi crypto wallet.

Yes buy a small amount, it's not hard, and it's easy to work with and hold on a phone wallet.  I'd use Edge, or Coimomi.
Then, once you get the hang of it, which only takes really about two times moving it, then start buying $5 a month or something small like that.

It depends how much you own. Typically mobile devices are more secure than computers. Paper wallets are more secure than mobile devices, however a lot of this is overkill on the security side of things. But most everybody agrees leaving your coins on somebody else's Exchange is the least secure.

I've found the Airbitz wallet set for low miner fees is the best. Did 5 transactions today they all were less than $0.20 each. Might take awhile to get into a block but if you're end-user isn't going to be spending their Bitcoin in the next hour that's fine.

You can upload MP3 files to our site...  but it's really meant for video.  REMEMBER... this is a PAY PER VIEW model, you are not BUYING files, you are paying per view... this model wasn't really possible at these micropayment levels before Bitcoin.  This is new and really hasn't been tried that much (or at all).  I know Vimeo has tried, but they of course require credit cards, signups, and are bound by legacy banking agreements.

Here is mine (doesn't really make a lot of sense in this context.. but still funny)
 
 Your Personalized Apology Letter
**Dear** 
**,**  
**I’m sorry, I know those two words are not enough to make this better or win you back. That’s not why I’m writing this. I want to tell you that I now see how much I hurt you and how wrong I was.**  
**I let my ego get the better of me and I see how that was the worst possible thing I could have done.**  
**Do you remember when**
**you pretended to be Satoshi and nobody believed you, then you said you could prove it, but then you didn't?**
**. That’s when I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I wanted you in my life.**  
**I can only hope that for all of these reasons you will feel that our relationship is worth saving. Please know that I get it now. When I shut my eyes and imagine how I would feel in your shoes, I completely understand your reaction. It is a big deal and my heart is breaking just thinking about it and I just can’t believe how much pain I’ve caused you.**  
**I love you so very much**
**, and I understand that I will have to live with your decision. Please come back to me.**  
**Love,**

This was announced on air (Free Talk Live) so it's not a secret but not widely known.  WatchMyBit just signed a deal with Domo Music Group and is working with a consultant at Disney.  
Press releases will be released next week.  We will have a booth at VidCon (largest YouTube convention).  Plus we will be releasing a new marketing/music video.

The cost to attend the event is much much higher.  Many people will find these speakers and their topics very valuable.  This is much more than a Bitcoin conference.  Many of the speakers share their very successful business secrets, the specific tools and strategies they use, and they are very motivating.  Some will consider the price very low, and if you don't value these speakers or their content at this price, that's okay too!

If someone wants you to tip you in bitcoin, get a wallet on your phone (Airbitz, Mycelium, Jaxx), get an address from that wallet, paste that on your website with a big sign that says 'I accept bitcoin tips here".

Hello and welcome to my page!  I have been inspiring others for over a decade by sharing my experience through natural birth, attachment parenting and Unschooling.  I'm an activist,  educator and author of, Radical Unschooling: A Revolution Has Begun, and will soon release my latest book, Radical Birth. I've been a proud advocate for Radical Unschooling through the media for the last eight years. You may have seen me on Dr. Phil, CNN, Nightline, and I was on Australia’s most popular morning news program, Morning Sunrise plus  60 Minutes Australia.  I've also appeared on The Jeff Probst Show, ABC’s hit show Wife Swap, Fox News, and the Bethenny Show. And now my adventure into Bitcoin begins!  Bitcoin is as radical as Unschooling, so it is a perfect fit for me.  Just think of bitcoins as the video game token you need start these special videos.  If you need help understanding or getting bitcoins of your own - Google!

Vinny did more to mainstream Bitcoin than most when his previous company, Gyft, began taking, and giving 3% cash back to anyone who bought gift cards with BTC.

Don't use the Blockchain wallet until they support it better and add more features.  Just not stable these days.  Airbitz and Mycelium are two better choices.
@_date: 2017-04-30 01:01:20
If on Android, use your phone and the Mycelium wallet.  It has a built in market to buy from people in your area.  Also it has Glidera integration which is a third party that connects to you bank account to buy (requires bank id etc).  Airbitz works on apple phone and Android... it also has Glider and LibertyX so you can walk into some stores and buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-04-06 04:07:57
as the receiver, you can change the bitcoin into dollars, gift cards, anything on Overstock.com...  Or you can choose to save it and maybe it will go up.  It could go down.  it's another form of value, get as much as you can.
And the apps you are looking for are called Coinbase (for turning bitcoins into $, Gyft for buying giftcards.

This is another reason to be annoyed by banks/financial industry/mortgage/insurance/Credit Cards:   They can deny an application, they have their reasons, but they won't/can't tell you.

Actually I've been rethinking this.... It annoys me, but then I realized if you think of 'blockchain' like a protocol, then it makes sense.  We don't say 'the email' or 'an email', or 'the http' or 'h.323 technology'... we say email, http, h.323 etc.
So...maybe it makes linguistic sense after all.

If you get involved now, you might benefit from any increase in price.  And of course you could lose money too.
Also you would be more prepared when/if it takes off more.
But bottom line, it is so easy to get involved as the decision to do so should be nearly irrelevant.  Just do it!
Step 1.  Download a phone app wallet... I like Airbitz if on iOS or Android.    Mycelium is good on Android.  Jaxx is good on both...but Airbitz most useful in my opinion
Step 2.  Buy some tiny amount (research where on line), or ask for a tip here on reddit.
Step 3.  ??
Step 4.  profit (at least technologically and experientially!)

You can buy videos at  most under $1 in btc.  75% of the funds go to the creator and they can split with many many co-creators or charities.  Here is never before seen sitcom with Jane Lynch and Danny Trejo in his 1st comedy role.  So you know you are getting what you pay for and not some stupid cat video, there is a free preview
Works best from a laptop, we will be mobile responsive next month.
Oh...YOU can also upload videos and try to earn btc yourself.  (you do the marketing's and social media sharing, we provide the Bitcoin (and altcoin) paywall.

This such a sad story.
I keep thinking how easy it would be have used Mycelium or Airbitz mobile wallets and simply get a new cheap phone and just sign back in (in Airbitz case), or insert 12 seed words (in Mycelium case).  And of course with some paper wallet hidden offsite, just sweep the btc to a new address.  What phone app were you using?

I pay for the internet (tmobile), I pay for the roads (gas tax), I pay for my health care (insurance).  And if the true cost of these services has been subsided, I would gladly pay the true cost, it's not fair that others pay for my stuff unless it's voluntary.  Could I then opt out of paying for a military and the corporate welfare that drives it?

This.  Days of syncing with the blockchain.  But it depends on what the newb is hoping/trying to do.

This risk is similar that all mechants face and price in.  Employee theft is much more likely and costly, not to mention shoplifting, and armed robbery.  If such a double spend wallet is invented a coffee fron a tiny ma and pa shop in Nisswa MN will probably not be the target.  And if this wallet gets develpoed, it will solved...there may be some losses, but it is a signal of a weakness that will be patched.

Mobile wallets on your phone: Airbitz, Jaxx, Mycelium, Bread wallet, Coinomi . . . or paper wallets, or hardware wallets like Trezor, Keep Key, Ledger.  these wallets are under your control (the private keys are held securely by the wallet), Coinbase is a custodial service like a bank: they control the private keys.

Airbitz is a good phone wallet. And Mycelium (for Android).  Yes, just start buying what you can afford each week and hold.  I know this can be tough for some young people as saving money is a foreign concept these days...but there have been many stories in this forum of new saving habits being formed and made easier (dare I say fun), because Bitcoin usually goes up (it can go down!  You have to be able to hold through downturns!).

Every mobile wallet does this automatically.  All a business needs is an iPad and loading a Mobile Wallet app like airbitz, mycelium, or many others. It's super easy to do this. I set up a coffee house to do this they've been making Bitcoin since 2015.  They use the airbitz wallet on their iPad point-of-sale system. The employees don't have to figure out any conversion rate the wallet does it automatically. You just type in the dollars required for the sale and a QR code is generated with that amount plus the address that it's being paid too. Bitcoin is not rocket science for end users anymore

Bitcoin is worldwide, and if you control the bitcoin, no one can take it and there is no risk from anything else being shut down.  In other words, if the US somehow shuts down all Bitcoin exchanges, you still own Bitcoin and you can still sell it on many foreign exchanges. Or you can buy stuff with it. But the chances of the US becoming very hostile to bitcoin is very very small.
Download a phone wallet app like airbitz, mycelium, bread, Samurai, Jaxx Etc.  You can buy Bitcoin at coinbase simply by attaching your bank account, or using a credit card, then move the Bitcoin to your phone wallet.  And you don't need to buy a whole Bitcoin, you can buy $5 worth of bitcoin.

I love Airbitz.  I get a lot of people to install it on both Android and iOS with no issues.

If it's under 1k$ or so, just move it to a phone wallet.  Airbitz, Bread wallet, Mycelium, Jaxx, etc.
Do the back ups!
If you hold a LOT, then paper wallets are very good (if created offline), also hardware wallets like Trezor, KeepKey, and Ledger.
But seriously, phone wallets are pretty secure for even a few thousand $ in my opinion (I hold a lot on phone wallets and have never had an issue...even had phones die on me completely, just signed in to my Airbitz account, or added my 12 word seed into Mycelium, and boom, all coins recovered -- this has happened to me twice with no issues at all -- my phone IS a hardware wallet!)

I know you don't have a smartphone...so to wrap your head around this much faster, install the Jaxx wallet as a Chrome plugin.  (jaxx.io).
You will then have a real life Bitcoin wallet. You can then post a Bitcoin address to this thread or one of the other of your many threads and some people will send you small amounts of Bitcoin. This will really truly help you grasp all of this. You're trying to read everything about it and you should just do it.
It is truly not this difficult. People who say Bitcoin is hard to use just don't realize how amazingly easy it is with today's tools. 
The wallet you get for your Chrome browser is not something that has to be permanent ,forever or even that secure just to play around with a few dollars in Bitcoin.
Just do it.  I personally will send you some Bitcoin so you can see it arrive in your wallet then you can send it back or to someone else.  Or even buy a 12 cent video on WatchMyBit.com

You never have to meet anybody in person face-to-face.  And get this, it is a Bankless network. Everything will be controlled through mobile apps. Look for our Vaults soon.

Local Bitcoins is a trusted platform that has been around for a long time. I've never used it however. I think you use them as an escrow service so you would move coins from a wallet you control to their escrow system. And Bitcoin is real money. But if you talking about selling it for government Fiat, you can do that on Coinbase or person to person through localbitcoins or maybe you can find a buyer at your local Bitcoin Meetup

How much energy does the current monetary system require? Think of all the bank buildings and their cost in energy every season for heating and cooling. Think of how much energy it took to build those buildings. Think of all the employees driving in cars on freeways to and from work. Think of all the armored cars and other tertiary businesses that Banks require. Now think of those giant Federal Reserve buildings in every state, and all of their bureaucrats and employees that go to and from these giant buildings every day, think about the u.s. mint and all of the machinery and associated agencies across the country required to support the minting of paper and coin money. Now multiply that by every country. In the world. Bitcoin is probably way more energy efficient.

@_date: 2017-09-16 13:44:11
There are large scale toll roads in many states.  They used to be run privately, just like New York's subway system.
Also interstate trucking pays for the US Freeways, that's why there are weigh stations all over (non-commercial vehicles--cars--get to use freeways wothout paying more.)
Another way to more fairly fund roads is with gas tax.  Yes taxation is theft, but a gas "tax" would really be a user fee.  You use the roads, you pay for the roads.  This way old people who don't drive aren't forced to pay something they don't use.

You don't need to sell your bitcoin and receive cash in a bank account to do this.  Sign up for an exchange (Coinbase has one called GDAX, anx there are others), then you can "sell" your bitcoin and leave the $ on the exchange, then buy back in when you think the price is at the lowest.

@_date: 2017-09-10 15:48:19
You can also 'sell' by buying gift cards to tons of stores using the Gyft mobile app.  But regarding, Coinbase, best practice is to move the BTC to a wallet you control on a phone.  Airbitz, Bread wallet, Mycelium, Jaxx are all good mobile wallet.

phone wallets are also pretty safe.  Safer than Coinbase, safer than a PC wallet... hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger are very safe --as are paper wallets as hardware and paper wallets are considered 'cold storage', meaning they are offline and not touching the internet.  That being said, and I repeat: phone wallets are pretty damn safe.  I've held BTC on many phone wallets since 2011, to the tune of of tens of thousands of dollars worth for many weeks at a time with zero problems, I currently have about 10k on one of my wallets and have no plans on moving it off any time soon (I do a lot of business and investing and traveling, so I need that money readily available).  I have had those phones die at times (twice in 2 years), and have had zero problems signing into my accounts on my new phones, or adding my seed words back in and having all my coins available quickly.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:03:33
Coinbase is okay to buy from, just don't store Bitcoin there. Once you buy it, move it to a wallet you control like your phone wallet.

@_date: 2017-10-27 03:43:56
That's not how fees work.  They are not a percentage of the size of the amount sent.  I sent $10 to a server, it cost me 14 cents, I could have sent him 10 million dollars and it still would have cost only 14 cents.
Fees are likely to decrease in the future with 2nd layer solutions too.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:57:10
If you are buying on Coinbase, that's fine, just move your coins to a wallet you control (phone wallets work great for amounts up to $500 imho).

Minimum relay fee?  I can use Mycelium's node in my phone and pay close to $0 if I want.  You can send a transaction with much less than .0001 if you want.  .00000001 is the lowest fee.  Many wallets allow this.  Sure you might wait, but you can choose your fee depending on wallet software.  I find Airbitz auto predicts the best lowest fee... Mycelium give you many choices of fees... many less than .0001
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:35:30

It sounds like we have the same business plan. We want to take down (by that I mean "coopitition'), or combine with, all other btms and Destroy traditional ATMs as they are stupid machines that do only one thing. Our machine has multiple functionality. A crrent apps does crypto buy and sell - with seven different crypto's ( Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Bcash, ether, Raven,  and we just added tokes which is a waves platform token.  This means we can add any of the wave assets too.), Bill pay, regular ATM, gift cards, cell phone minute top ups and eventually check cashing and more; actually, we just  provide a platform and machine, and a whole lot of cash that can be used for any business. Cash as a service means that third-party businesses can use the cash in the vaulting teller machine for whatever their purposes. Also third-party companies can accept cash for whatever the purposes are.  We take out of the equation the very expensive cash management and cash companies like Brinks Loomis and Garda.

Nope, to test what you said, I went into Gyft, just bought a $25 gift card to Target no problem.  Why did you say they stopped accepting Bitcoins?  They stopped offering a 3% cash back for using Bitcoin, but that was over a year ago.

Anyone who makes video content can earn bitcoin at  another great way to make btc!  Potentially a lot if you have popular/valuable content.  Just sign up and start uploading, market to your existing fans or find new bitcoin fans.
For example, if you charged just 21 cents and got 10,000 views, you would earn over $1500.  YouTube would give $6 to $60.
Here is the explainer video     and here is a use case scenario for bands    
And her is a never before seen sitcom with Danny Trejo and Jane Lynch for just 21 cents.  Open the link on a laptop or tablet, scan qr code with your phone wallet, enjoy!

You can demonstrate so many Bitcoin concepts by pulling up a video on WatchMyBit.com on a laptop and launching it using your smart phone wallet.  Like this 25 cent one for example: 
Concepts taught.
-QR codes, and scanning them with phone
-phone wallets
-worldwide payments
-Bitcoin network communication (WMB triggers on transaction sent, not confirmations).
 But the best way to get people's eyes to light up with the Ah Hah moment is to have them download a mobile wallet, and send them a dollar.  That usually does it ... then have them pay for a video at WatchMyBit for more education.

I always post this. Bitcoin is Cash. You don't have to cash out. Just start buying stuff. Gyft is a great app for buying almost any gift card. I know someone who
 spent thousands on remodeling her kitchen with Home Depot gift cards

Before your presentation, you must get some bitcoins on your phone.  Download Airbitz app, send you public address here, I"ll send you some btc.
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:44:44
What's going on is you bear a HUGE risk that you will be ripped off by accepting gift cards.  Don't do it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:52:23
There are apps galore now. So simple my 8 year old niece has an Airbitz wallet on her iPhone.  The only thing complicated is if want to know HOW the math works....But I bet you don't know how the math works on your encrypted credit card.
Point is, noobs don't need to know HOW it works, just THAT it works.

Nope!  Launches upon transaction sensed on the network.

Overstock.com accepts it.  So do CheapAir, Tiger Direct, Gyft (which hands down answers the question, 'what can I buy with bitcoins?" easily....I bought and used a Starbucks gift card I bought with bitcoin today, also bought Whole Foods cards and Target cards...all while making 3% cash back using the Gyft app.  
You can also watch videos at WatchMyBit.com, like this never before seen sit-com co-starring Jane Lynch before she was famous for just 21 cents in btc.

Go to 
Just check it out for now. You will see the private key on the right, and public address is on the left. The idea is you can send money to the public address, and when you want to spend it you scan the QR code on the right which is the private address. All phone wallets that I know will allow you to pull money off of paper wallets by scanning the private key.

Bitcoin is entering Hollywood.  r/Bitcoin, if you watch this film (which has won several awards, and is decent) the word will get out that film makers can make money with Bitcoin.  Word will get out and instantaneous world wide releases become a thing (an issue right now in the film industry)... of course there are multiple other benefits too!
Here is our press release.  Thank you!!

WatchMyBit Allows Filmmakers to Distribute and Monetize Worldwide
Independent Filmmaker Peter McEvilley Collects Money For Every View, Paid Everyday
Los Angeles, CA. (November 2015) –  WatchMyBit (WMB) allows artists and their management teams to distribute video content and, most importantly, collect and distribute content royalties anywhere in the world regardless of borders and boundaries.  Writer, director, producer &amp; composer Peter McEvilley is a filmmaker whose award winning film, On Falling, is the first full length movie to be uploaded to the Bitcoin powered platform.
Independent films are passion projects, and rarely make any money,  “The idea that my film could earn money on every view is just amazing.  And that viewers don’t need credit card or a bank is revolutionary”.
The YouTube trailer of the film can be seen here 
The film can be seen in it’s entirety here 
A portion of every view goes to the Everbody Is A Star Foundation (.
Howard Sapper, the executive producer of the film and an early co-founder of WatchMyBit explains more advantages:, “The ability to instantly split incoming payments among artists, writers, management, distributors and even charities has never been possible before,” he continues, “With WatchMyBit, the savings in payment processing, bookkeeping and legal fees alone are astonishing.”  Sapper goes on to explain another way to use the innovative platform: “Raising production funds has become so much easier now that we can instantly collect and distribute payments with each view.  This means backers aren’t just sharing the risk, but also the direct rewards for each and every view.”
Doug Scribner, CEO of WatchMyBit explains his vision for filmmakers and other artists:  “Borders and boundaries are irrelevant to streaming videos and music, we believe payments to artists should be just as fast and free.  By using Bitcoin (and soon PayPal)  micropayments, the whole team can get paid every single day, not just 12 times a year.
McEvilley has already started funding for his next film; a short film to accompany a track from his latest release,  Analog.  “It’s much easier to get funding, because now, my backers will earn a percentage off every view, just like the lead actors.  This gives everyone a huge incentive not just to make great art, but to share it with everyone they know”.
WMB is not just for filmmakers. Musicians, Vloggers, Lets Plays, web series and content creators anywhere can monetize their original videos.

Not really... it's just that in the mortgage example there are SOOOOooo many middlemen and they are just automatically in the process and have been for decades that we don't even know how many there are.  
With Bitcoin, we are just more aware of the the additional step (and a much less expensive step, that takes much less time).

Earl, paying for videos with micropayments IS a killer feature.  That's why we started  !!

Ironically, I believe WEB wallets like JAXX are more secure... but I've never used a desktop wallet.  I DO use JAXX on Chrome (and Android).  If you have a lot of BTC you want to hold onto consider learning safe paper wallet storage or buy a hardware wallet.

For example, [Chris Bailey]( is a huge Hollywood animator/animation supervisor (He did x-Men II for example) and he is experimenting with WMB.  He uploaded this never before seen '[pitch trailer]( for a movie he is shopping around.  By paying 49 cents--and the proceeds go to his bitcoin phone wallet-- you are sending market signals to him that this Bitcoin thing might be a cool way to release his future works

Few care about the mechanics and protocols banks and credit cards use.  They just care that it works.  Bitcoin just works also. 
Get a phone wallet and acquire some btc, then spend some small amounts (like on a 21 cent or less video at WatchMyBit.com) and it will all make sense.

download a wallet to your smartphone (do you have one?).
Airbitz is good (iOS and Android), so is Mycelium, (Android only).
Move any btc you buy there if it's under $250 or so (be sure to write down seed words (back up), or do the password recovery (and do 2 factor authentication too!))

Right, so that is legit.  I bought half the family cabin with btc.  I had Second Market send a wire on closing day after I gave them bitcoins.  It could be argued that this was a 3rd party in the middle so not really a true bitcoin transaction... but all of your examples, including the mortgage one, uses MANY 3rd parties to get fiat to the actual mortgage holder (your paycheck to your bank, your bank to visa network, or check service, then to mortgage holder's bank (or more likely a processing middleman), then to the actual mortgage holder... there are probably many more middle men involved, those were just a few I could think of)... all by way of saying you can do anything with btc today you can do with fiat using middle men.  Just like we use (have to use), so many middle men with 'normal' money.

@_date: 2016-05-14 02:03:54
Nope!  YouTube is a great add driven service that is huge.  It's a great place put up content you don't want to monetize.  
We suggest artists use YouTube in many ways in conjunction with WatchMyBit.com.  
For example, part 1 on YouTube, Part 2 on WMB for some amount of btc.  Or, monetize the EARLY release of regular videos, like three days at 50cents on WMB, then to YouTube for free.  Super fans will happily pay a small amount for the chance to see artists they love early--and knowing the money goes to them not advertisers.

I agree with this, many people and your students will be visual learners.  I really hope you will be showing live demonstrations on the big screen between your phone wallet and actual Bitcoin sites, otherwise you might put your students to sleep.  
Start with a live demo at  or   SHOW them actual transactions, give them all $1 in btc, have them scan the qr codes on screen.  Have them trade amongst themselves.  THEN break out the slides and names or protocols.

Credit cards= less trustworthy, easy to scam/hack.
Bitcoin = more trustworthy ( ironically because less trust is needed), harder to scam/hack.
Therefore, it is the credit card portion of the equation that is requiring all the id and hoops to jump through.

@_date: 2017-07-18 18:20:05
Mycelium is only supported on Android at this time.  If you are using iOS, don't use that Mycelium app.
Mycelium by definition is NOT cold storage as it is an app on an internet connected smart phone.
It is better than nothing and your coins should be safe. 
Cold storage refers to a paper wallet or hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger) that are NOT on line.
I would only worry about using cold storage if you have more than 1 bitcoin.

We talk to regular people about how Overstock, Expedia, WordPress, Microsoft all take Bitcoin. We can show them Gyft but still, they need 10 dollars in BTC before they can buy a gift card. 
At this point people stop thinking about Bitcoin except for the few geeks who really get it and want to explore more.
 is the best way to show the power and promise of bitcoin.
We always talk about micro-payments, and how useful and inexpensive they can be. But there has been no way to demonstrate micro-payments until now.
The ability to say to regular, non-technical people 'you can buy this video right now for 11 cents' - - and actually show them-- that might really persuade the masses of the real Bitcoin power.
Plus, for all the Bitcoin evangelists out there who have been giving away $1 here and there, with the price so low, that $1 starts to get expensive. Now that evengelists can give away 15 cents - - and there's actually a place where people can instantly spend just 15 cents.... This could be huge!

Depends on the seller, and the amount they want to sell is listed on their profile.

If you have less then a full bitcoin, a phone wallet like Airbitz, Bread, Jaxx or Mycelium (Android only) are perfectly safe and you control the private keys.

Some have cashed out, but they all learn about markets.  All of my co-workers have phone wallets, one bought $300 from me today.  Got my girlfriend's mom and brothers involved the same way.

Thanks for your polite response. And for clarifying what you found to be un user-friendly.  And I agree, Bitcoin itself is not very user-friendly we are all quite early to this party. But when you think about it if someone has Bitcoin they already have a wallet in their pocket typically. This is the most likely way Bitcoin will expand and grow with people having Bitcoin on their smartphones and transferring Bitcoin from their smartphones - web payment services are very easy with QR code scanning and soon other methods.

I don't 'store' with the wallets I use.  I hold my btc...I get several benefits from Airbitz and Mycelium already.
I have about 5 banks on my phone, 'banks' with no possibility of ANOTHER person taking, losing, being robbed, pay fees too etc.
The whole point of Bitcoin is to replace banks.

I use btc at a coffeehouse, to buy videos on WMB, and to send to newbies all the time.   I don't really wait for any confirmations.  Neither does the coffee house and WatchMyBit launches videos on transaction, not confirmation.  
The only time I wait for one confirmation is if I'm buying bitcoin through Mycelium Local Trader in person.

I verified with Rassah from mycelium. The iOS wallet is not supported and hasn't been supported in years. If it's working well that's great, just understand mycelium doesn't support the iOS wallet only the Android wallet.

I just verified with Rassah (Dima) who works for Mycelium.  Though there is an app in the App Store... Mycelium is NOT supported on iOS, and hasn't been for years.

Airbitz is a great wallet supported on both iOS and Android.
A lot of people also like Bread Wallet for iOS.

That's what I'm wondering... but I seem to be profiting from it.  However, when I tried to move the 5 new found btc to my AirBitz wallet... nothing shows up.  I'm looking at this address  as a new one I created in AirBitz.  I don't see any pending transactions in AirBitz wallet either.  Mycellium shows the transaction as Not Transmitted with a strange icon I haven't seen before.  I used priority too.

There is a lot of great content that creators don't paid well for.  We offer a platform for artists to ask for and get paid for what they want.  If fans are willing to pay for something they find valuable, that is up to them.  To them it is not a joke, and the creator can now earn enough give fans more of what they want.  This is between fans and creators.  If you are neither, who are you to decide what is a joke?

all of the above.
But most important BUY some and GIVE it way in 50 cent chunks to new people who download a phone wallet.
This TEACHES people about btc and spreads it.
If asked, 'where can I spend 50 cents of btc', send them over to  where there are many videos for under 40 cents.  This is a great one starring Jane Lynch and Danny Trejo  (and yes, the producer/writer/director gets the proceeds and put it up himself -- he is invested in WMB).

Yup [Blockchain.info]( and [Bitcoin.com]( refuse to use the latest Bitcoin upgrade to SegWit.  This means fees will always be higher.  I recommend Coinomi or Edge or Mycelium.
Also if she has many small amounts of BTC collected in the wallet, and then you send one larger amount out, all those small amounts means the fees will be higher too, regardless of the wallet.
But using wallets that upgrade to the latest version of Bitcoin software is the best start.  If your addresses start with a 1, you are not using the latest version.  Addresses in the latest upgrade will start with a 3 or bc1.

BTW, one issue we ran into is if you have a built in bitcoin holding wallet attached to your platform, you are now holding customer funds which makes you a custodial account creator and holder.  Not sure what kind of tax bracket that puts you in or the kind of extra regulations you will have to jump through (way to expensive for us)...plus you could be a target for hackers if you are holding customer btc -- super high security needed.

Your last paragraph illustrates yet another reason Bitcoin will succeed and possibly lead to more peace in the world (by hopefully, one day, starving politicians of their funds to wage meaningless wars--not to mention any other stupid thing politicians may want to do).... many may choose to underreported by 100%.  This could lead to a system where people could voluntarily give to any entity and system that they value instead of being forced to fund programs and 'services' they never use or are morally opposed to.
Yay voluntaryism!

I paid a portion of my weight training service from a friend in bitcoin . He really didn't want any at all, but I felt he wasn't charging me very much for his time and great motivation and help. This was two years ago when bitcoins were $10 each. 5 months his wife "gets it" . But he still has no clue however his wife took over the wallet and she has been investing a lot of money in to bitcoin, and has done very well thanks to my knowledge and help. The funny part is he knows nothing about the thousand she has put into Bitcoin nor the thousands that she has made. He thinks its a big scam. His wife is an accountant and holds a PhD in statistics, she pays the bills.

don't claim any thing that nobody really knows about. I'm not a tax person, but why would you admit to having something when you don't have to? Literally take the 5th, and don't be a witness against yourself, anything you say can and will be used against you. They have no way to know that you own bitcoin, unless you speak against yourself.

It's true that most of the videos are also available on YouTube for free.  But if you want to kick start the Bitcoin economy, we believe the FASTEST way will be through Hollywood and music.
Please watch a few of these 11 cent videos.  This will send a message to Domo Records to begin using Bitcoin as an integral part of their business and might attract more artists, labels, and studios to Bitcoin!

A small group of friends and I had the same problem while active the Libertarian Party... it was a bunch of cantankerous old gold standard geeks who couldn't match their shoes with their belts.  And when the rare female came to a meeting, she was quickly turned off by these dweebs who couldn't stop staring at her boobs.  This turned off so many 'normal' people that we were just banging our heads against the wall half the time.  
However, I feel Bitcoiners are such a divers group (of mostly men, yes) that there are a LOT more regular people who don't suffer from social anxiety.  My girlfriend feels comfortable coming to our local meetups!  
But I agree with everything you said.

Think of every skyscraper Banks build, and Heat and operate .. now think of every bank branch building in every city in every state in the Union. Each needs Heating and Cooling construction costs Etc. Now think of every employee who drives back and forth to every one of these buildings and skyscrapers. Now imagine all the armored car services that go to every single bank and all the stores and Merchants they service. Think about all the brokerage houses and Federal Reserve buildings in every state and all the printing presses, not to mention all of the needless Wars funded by our fractional Reserve System.
Now multiply that by every country with any banking infrastructure.

So without the government people wouldn't build roads?   "greedy" people would build roads so customers can get to their stores... Disney would build roads so people get to their parks (and actually, they do in many ways do build the roads. They directly pay for governments to get the roads built. I think this could be done without the government, but this is at least an example of how roads get built. Also the , the interstate trucking industry almost solely pays for  interstate freeways, that is why you see all those weigh stations on roads.. These roads would get built without government)

Mention that something like 80‰ of 100 dollar bills have cocaine residue on it because it is the preferred currency for drug dealers, mobsters, hitman gangsters and other violent thugs.

Heard about Bitcoin from the greatest radio show ever,  Free Talk Live (.com)!  Gavin Adresen called them and explained Bitcoin on the air in 2010 sometime.  He later went up to Keene NH and had lunch with the hosts, Mark and Ian.  
I knew I wanted to buy bitcoin after hearing about it on FTL.  Finally, around May 2011 I bought my first Bitcoins at just over $3.00.  At Porcfest the following June, I made my first sale in Bitcoins to Mark Edge, one of the hosts of FTL; he bought one of my smoothies.
Special thanks to Charlie Shrem and Eric Voorhees who helped Mark and I get wallets on our phones at the time.
I've been buying ever since.
