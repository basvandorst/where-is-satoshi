My first bubble was the one in 2013, but I couldn't hodl up and sold most of it in 2014. I've learned a lot from that mistake, so I'm not giving up this time.

It wasn't just Bitstamp, it was the whole Slovenian crypto community. Bitstamp was one of the sponsors though.

Behold! My shitcoins...

To be honest, the crypto penetration and awareness are pretty big in Slovenia. The biggest shopping area in the country is in the process of implementing crypto payments in every store in that area. 
Fun fact: The shopping area is called BTC City, although that acronym does not mean Bitcoin :) [

It looks like it, but it's not ;) the same happened in 2014 and the bear market lasted for two years. But then the bull came back and Bitcoin got even stronger :)

What can you do? We gotta be supportive to each other and keep posting the memes ��
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:19:43
We also think so :)
@_date: 2018-10-31 13:45:35
That's true
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:09:13
Yes, it's also written in the article ��
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:55:09
Maybe he has enough personal bitcoins
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:19:14
Yes, he did. He even posted the intention on Reddit: [
Now the process has gone a few steps further, there's already a formal civil rehabilitation, which is how these bitcoins will be distributed to Mt.Gox users.

I don't think they are different but I'm open to your explanation.
@_date: 2019-10-13 08:54:07
95% of dollars are digital and are thus a virtual currency. So you can easily say yes, I own virtual currency. If they later ask you which virtual currency, you can still say: U.S. Dollars :D
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:54:24
So what's wrong with the rest 80%? ��

Neither Hal nor Nick would be afraid to use their real names in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Satoshi was someone new in the cypherpunk movement at the time.

Well, the problem is the point of exchange, where your identity could be revealed.
@_date: 2018-11-17 21:18:11
And then you get struck by a truck :P

Haha, go to bread :) if the op really watched this episode he would understand the reference :)
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:48:05
I watched this episode (My Sister, My Sitter). No electric coins in it.
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:06:30
I think it actually works! Bitcoin currently up 2.61% ��
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:17:03
That's why "conspiracy" is written in quotes. The point of the article is something else.
