Doesn't mount gox's bank charge nasty transfer fees though?  I recall a fee of 1000 yen when their bank receives money.

don't forget  
The problem is that if you try and use an international vendor than than you're going to pay A LOT in fees. 
For example, if you transfer DIRECTLY from you to MT. Gox, you're going to get hit by a $12 (1000 yen) receival fee at their bank, and if any currency chances automatically happen en-route, you will be charged again. Not to mention your bank will likely hit you again.
Australian is your best value for money for everything except LARGE purchases, I.E. Thousands of dollars, i.e. when 20+ of fees wouldn't phase you.
I've had a GREAT experience with bit innovate, but bit piggy is somewhat cheaper whilst spendbitcoins has a nasty little 10% fee (although they are definitely the best to do BTC-&gt;AUD transactions, doing bank transfers and giving you 102% of the exchange rate with no fees.)
As you're in Australia, you're 100% going to take a loss when you first buy, it's a horrible thing, I know. I bought in when the buy-in price was 11/each from Australian Vendors, and i've only just made my money back at 12.44(Aud Vendor BUY PRICE Again).
P/much, you're going to buy, and it's going to have to rise ~$1 before you recover and start returning on your investment.
I'd say that now is probably a good time to buy in, as it's started a nice little rise again, however keep in mind it is VERY LIKELY to drop again in the short-term future(my opinion, i hope to buy in a second time), but if that doesn't happen, you'll be paying more AUD for the same amount of BTC.
TL;DR: BitPiggy is the cheapest, BitInnovate has topnotch service, and SpendBitcoins is the best for getting it back into AUD.

Would it be a fair guess that value will rise dramatically after the reward cut?

You're going to hit a bit of a wall for this. 
There are.... infinitely few choices for this. The only semi-decent one i've seen is 
Which will allow you to configure a mining program to run when the computer has been idle for x amount of minutes with no popups or messages.

Well fuck. Didn't even think of that, that's perfect.
