Isn't LN technically, an off chain transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:08:35
You know we have a friggin satellite right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:46:19
I've told my wife not to ask me about the Bitcoins we hold or the price....it's heaven!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:25:32
Sorry, did I miss something? When did we have a correction? Last one was at ~$10k
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:55:29
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:02:29
Oh you can fuck off !
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:23:46
Then the exchange goes down as the price starts to drop and everyone panic sells yet you can't get out because your using KRAKEN and the Apple ll powering the exchange has over heated again.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:44:15
Yes, taking transactions off chain will kill alts...lol
You know a lot of alts can scale way more than Bitcoin and keep transactions on chain 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:14:00
You obviously are new here...nothing is impossible when it comes to Bitcoin. We have a futures market that does $1 quadrillion annually that is going to be playing in this market. 
Your damn skippy we could go to $6k-$7k easily
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:57:32
What a fucking douche!
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:56:56
What? You too
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:31:00
Is Bitcoin threatening the status quo? Governments, banks and institutions. The war hasn't even started yet...lol
It's not all going to be rainbows and sunshine on the road to $100k, $500k and $1m! There will be some 40-70% drops in there
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:42:42
And yes... 
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:19:16
Shit going down!
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:51:41
This guy doesn't Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:03:02
It's only been 30mins...That's see in 48hrs. A lot of exchanges crashed, once those come back online I think people will want to close their positions
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:57:34
Shit going down!
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:52:09
Or dump hard because Segwit has been priced in....(+_+)
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:11:49
Another Pets.com....lol 
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:11:04
IT'S TIME TO SELL AND BUY LOWER
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:46:33
I went into a coffee shop in my city(big major city) that accepts Bitcoin. I asked how many times in the last couple of months has someone spent Bitcoin here? He said he tried accepting Bitcoin twice, both times the confirmation took to long and they just paid in dollars after waiting for mins lol
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:00:46
So we are about to hit a bear market on the last or next doji?
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:17:08
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:05:26
Already priced in, whales used the run up to activation to drive the price up and have been cashing out slowly all week.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:32:10
Then went to $2900 then down again to $1700
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:39:25
He dead
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:39:20
Double fake, what is your dad in his 20's lol
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:36:38
lol...I couldn't tell with all the meme's about price...lol
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:43:44
He has some valid points...
Is Bitcoin being accepted by governments? No
Is Bitcoins value based on perceived and faith based value? Yes
Is digital scarcity the same as physical scarcity? Yes
Are Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies being used as a currency? No
Any arguments against what he said?
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:36:51
I'll take that one kind sir ��
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:45:16
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:49:52
Stop laundering money for Comrade Putin!
@_date: 2017-08-29 03:51:12
We are not super jizzing through $4400? Is it going to be another flaccid disappointing floppy Bitcoin cuck?
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:41:41
Cause things go up for ever...and this time it's different
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:58:41
Yes, that is what I'm saying...they paid twice because it took to long. He literally hasn't had *anyone* ask since and he's the second most frequented cafe besides Starbucks.
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:41:05
I got my micro tweezers and hot sauce right here 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:34:16
Price drop
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:15:28
Is he supposed to have that face of someone who's had a frontal lobotomy?
Or is that look of someone realizing that this ride is unsafe and he could die at any moment?
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:44:13
Because everything goes up forever, right folks!?!
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:44:22
You guys are dreaming if you think an ETF is going to be approved in the near future...lol....lol...lol...*cough*...*cough*...okay I'm done
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:56:26
Oh here we go...so now we are keeping FIAT for small purchases...lol
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:28:00
But we have satellites! This fixes everything
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:29:39
@_date: 2017-08-29 03:12:25
When your system of control is at risk you will do anything to keep it!
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:37:28
Alts are sucking out the momentum
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:23:24
And what do you think BCH is going to be used for?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:21:55
Yes...we get it...and yes we are butt hurt!
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:23:06
And VeriCoin and Verium it will be
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:39:09
Or they didn't have logo on when the pic was taken...lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:40:01
Exactly, they took a picture of the prototype without the logo on since it isn't shipping yet...big deal!
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:22:31
What's the sub say? That will answer your question /s
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:26:36
What if traveling back in time is possible but traveling forward is impossible?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:57
SURPRISE! He has no dick!
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:25:51
Ouch for you
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:52:28
Try this...put your right foot behind your left foot, now put your left behind your right foot, now repeat... congratulations your traveling backwards!
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:48:06
Oh....fuck you on so many levels!
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:42:58
I thought Martin Shkreli was are new savior!?! 
Oh right, he's in jail getting his rectum smashed by Big Twinky Jim
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:56:51
Who says they haven't? 
And who says the government isn't watching every single transaction?
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:02:04
Nope waiting for the bigger drop tomorrow or Tuesday...watching carefully tho
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:53:30
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:15:14
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:08:45
This pic needs an update
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:06:01
Ask Big Twinky Jim, Martin's got his mouth full
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:21:31
Well we still haven't had a big correction since $3000, we are due.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:08:54
But LN is centralization not decentralization!
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:35:57
You calling Charlie fat?
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:02:42
Sure, but how many are actually buying? Any data on that? 
How many accounts sit empty never getting past the verification step because they don't want to give their personal information?
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:08:05
Moon meme's and people wanting to get rich quick. When people start to cash out at $5k we will see some real fireworks. I got my finger on the sell button when that happens ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:55:33
Anything really
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:11:29
RemindMe! 1 year

@_date: 2017-09-04 03:49:00
People care what Trump has to say, so don't put it by the dumbest people on the planet
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:50:07
Dude, don't worry...just hang in there...Bitcoin is not going to zero. You may loose on the short term but Bitcoin isn't going anywhere and we will be talking about this correction in a years time and say to ourselves that was fun but now look how much it's worth. Just step away for awhile, it will be fine
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:32:52
Lost forever
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:32:27
I stand corrected
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:43:57
Bobby Lee?
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:03:24
It's spelt "YUGE!"
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:47:59
They are closing down on September 30th
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:20:56
How when all others are not regulated
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:25:53
Jebus my chestnuts!
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:43:53
I think we got our new "HODL"!
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:10:41
Boobie Lee?
@_date: 2017-09-26 04:33:46
Awesome Bulgaria! 
(Looks up Bulgaria)
Oh!?! Can Bitcoin run on mud?
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:22:26
Who says what?
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:42:58
I thought Martin Shkreli was are new savior!?! 
Oh right, he's in jail getting his rectum smashed by Big Twinky Jim
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:17:20
This one time Bitcoin went $4800, and then it crashed to $2200
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:56:34
I'm not looking forward to the suicide posts when we crash through $3000
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:56:34

I think you are giving Trump to much credit here... President Baby Hands isn't capable of making a decision like that
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:22:50
The big drop?
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:26:43
Percentages buddy, percentages! 
20% are just dips, not corrections
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:48:41
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:55:24

@_date: 2017-09-03 21:42:22
He ded in the nats
@_date: 2017-09-26 04:30:31
But how would people get rich if people spend it? You must horde and never spend /s
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:44:22
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:50:07

Just step away for awhile, it will be fine
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:39:00
But we haven't had a drop yet! $200-$400 swings are normal...when we see a drop of $800-$1000+ then you will see some panic
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:50:13
So is that how we are supposed to spread adoption, well I guess we are doomed folks
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:48:06
Oh....fuck you on so many levels!
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:29:56
