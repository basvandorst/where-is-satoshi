What are you even talking about? I'm just making fun of Bitcoins fees
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:19:47
If history repeats itself, shouldn't it drop more than 11%?
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:21:54
They will use bitpay as their payment processor, which means insane fees whether you like it or not :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:44:31
More like 99% of investors
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:28:49
What? Where is bitcoin 12900?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:44:02
Yeah, hopefully. But what altcoin are you even talking about? I'm all about Bitcoin, but you simply can't look past it's flaws at the moment. Average transaction of BTC is over $70k now, and it hit nearly $180k the other day - it's a whales market. Regular people can't afford $30-$50 tx fees and if they want to pay less they will have to wait several days, or weeks even. It doesn't even do what it's supposed to do at the moment.
Of course it doesn't really matter because BTC has the first mover advantage, and the name recognition. It's here to stay, but I just find it funny when people get grumpy when people point out actual flaws of it.

damn, who would want to pay 25% more for their ticket?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:45:03
YEAH! WHO THE FUCK WANTS MONEY ANYWAY!
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:16:38
Never buy at the [delusion]( phase.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:45:16
we didnt hit 12k tho
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:24:14
Fees right now are alot higher than that. You can expect to pay $34-$37 for a $25 dollar transaction with Bitpay right now, which obviously is completely ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:41:32
Well, I wouldn't accept something that may drop 50-80% in the coming months either. Just being realistic here, feel free to come back at me why you think I'm wrong.

Don't Invest what you can't lose.. it's not worth it, especially this far into the bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:22:23
Not with bitpay, which Steam used. Try it out urself 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:27:19
Not if you consider it a bubble
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:23:33
Beauty of Bitcoin, it doesn't even do what it's supposed to do 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:14:58
You have to remember that we hit $15k YESTERDAY.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:27:30
I agree, it's pretty silly.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:41:01
Yeah, just your average, good 'old Sunday sell off am I right...?
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:38:12
When in trouble or in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:44:02
I mean, you could've sold yesterday and bought back today... 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:16:20
You still lost **profit**
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:22:19
Maybe in the US, but not in the UK, where he is a citizen.
