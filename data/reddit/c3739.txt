I have no idea and no one else really knows. This is why I'm not investing.

Zero Hedge always seems to think the world is ending. Bitcoin is not going to soar because of Greece.
@_date: 2015-06-25 03:47:02
But you can verify documents, etc. independant of Stampery? If not, then I pass.
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:07:15
If anything they are buying dollars or euros. Bitcoin is really interesting, but I wish this space would grow up a bit.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:15:39
The average person has no need to use bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:27:55
You aren't adjusting for inflation for one.
@_date: 2015-06-25 21:34:26
Funny all the downvotes my post got.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:12:02
How many times has the $10,000 guarantee been used so far?
@_date: 2015-06-27 12:27:16
Yes, that is very good point. I just don't think that it's a given that bitcoin will spike because of Greece, as a lot of posts here seem to imply.
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:17:57
How are you calculating that just out of curiosity?
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:16:51
I live in Chicago but not attending the conference. Can I still see the movie? Please? :D
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:28:57
So do I just show up?

I'm assuming that file would be on my Nexus 7 tablet, but I'm not seeing it for some reason. Do you know by chance what the location would be?
@_date: 2014-10-08 23:51:12
When I enter exactly that it says "Torcc config did not verify." What could I be doing wrong?
@_date: 2014-08-29 00:16:49
The Extropy list still exists?!
@_date: 2014-10-08 03:09:28
So how do you collection on donations?
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:45:59
Hey how's it going!

An experiment that appears to be failing.
@_date: 2015-01-31 01:44:34
Bitcoin belongs to nobody.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:03:02
What analysis. This is why bitcoin has problems.
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:49:05
Pretty please, with sugar on top?
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:36:57
I agree. Bitcoin will be more accepted after going through these growing pains.
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:16:48
This. If I make a purchase with a credit card, I have recourse if something goes wrong. With bitcoin I'm screwed.
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:18:38
That's my point.
@_date: 2015-05-13 23:00:20
I love it how everyone talks about bitcoin like it's the next internet. Bitcoin is but a drop in the large ocean of finance, and the price hasn't exactly been going to the moon.
@_date: 2016-01-09 22:24:08
How does this shock anyone? 
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:51:26
Are there any numbers concerning adoption rates over time?
@_date: 2015-07-18 22:05:35
You are an idiot and the reason no one takes bitcoin seriously.
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:03:03
And he doesn't have financial sense because he doesn't embrace bitcoin? Really?
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:58:59
I'd like to see retrospective analysis of all of ZeroHedge's posts. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:28:34
So has Greece left the Euro yet?
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:16:02
And who are you?
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:16:03
Thanks for looking at the numbers.
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:28:12
So why is everyone on Facebook?
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:46:10
" they predict exactly what's going on months in advance"
Just stop.

Seriously dude, I don't know why you don't have any upvotes. The guy's a billionaire. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:09:44
I don't get the connection.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:36:12
Great analysis.
@_date: 2017-04-19 02:28:38
Don't forget about smart ponzi scheme contracts. =)
@_date: 2015-04-25 03:13:36
Because, you know, BTC is an amazing investment.
@_date: 2015-09-16 19:20:54
So much for a decentralized currency.
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:58:23
Didn't Coinfire say something about an investigation of some sort?
@_date: 2015-09-24 22:58:38
I hope the authorities know where Garza is.
@_date: 2015-09-22 06:05:47
Something something blockchain.

@_date: 2015-04-22 14:05:44
Correct me if I'm wrong, but making a purchase from, say, Newegg is so much simpler with a credit card.

@_date: 2015-09-24 22:01:06
From what case is this deposition from? Any ideas?
@_date: 2015-03-15 23:32:01
How exactly would you do a FIFO calculation with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:01:53
And he's in jail.
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:04:47
@_date: 2015-03-14 16:22:35
So concerning hardware, what exactly can you deduct? Is it the initial price you paid or depreciation?
Concerning cost basis, is FIFO or LIFO?
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:47:23
I'm so sick of Andreas. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:00:37
So get a lawyer.
@_date: 2015-03-20 01:11:35
Bitcoin is the next internet. Andreas told me so.
@_date: 2015-10-02 19:05:00

Too bad the bitcoin chart looks like crap these days.
