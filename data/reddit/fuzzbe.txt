Some existing market site rebranded to the name/color scheme of Silk Road, I thought it was a joke (the site really did rebrand, but sort of a 'hey, lets have fun' redo).  The article maybe has a picture of that site?

I'm not even able to pretend to be an attorney in my living room, let alone on the Internet. I'm just guessing (hoping?) that he isn't as short sighted as he appears to be. At some point, it needs to hit the court systems if they want to have a legal distinction between a service provider and the stuff sold on the service.
If he never took possession of the drugs and never took possession of the funds, not sure what he would be. Not even sure if "controlling release of funds" is or is not "taking possession" since the funds could only ever go one of two ways.
Also, not saying that his ploy would work in court. After all, there are plenty to don't pay federal taxes based on something to do with maritime flags and the use of a pyramid on the US dollar and being or not being a citizen of the US and all that stuff... I think the IRS so far has a 100% win rate against them.
I guess that there's just a part of me that hopes an $8million dollar a month operation wasn't run by a guy who linked his personal email account to the servers without him having some sort of a higher motive in mind.

I disagree. All they have to do is require something from an KYC compliant account. I put in a bank issued debit card, I'm complaint. I use a coinbase account to recieve the bitcoin, I'm compliant. I'm not going to hand over my information to an ATM for a $20 bill.

That's a bit mean. In the carbon based world, people always share stuff like drink, food, cigarettes. It's a form of social bonding. Changetip just gives the ability online. It's a bit like karma except that you're not limited to 'just one vote' (a system that is good due to the use of the karma points). Instead, you can toss as many coins as you like depending on how much you liked the post.

First - Congrats on the new gig. I wish you much success!
Second: 
I think that needs to be discussed (at least among your team). Right now public confirmation shows that the tip did in fact go through. There's been some trolls on here that seem to be tipping huge amounts that are just trolling with no intention of the tip ever actually happening. It would be really nice if changetip would take those messages and (a) add a post to the thread that the person is not configured to tip and (b) after the 3rd fake tip, send a notice to the subreddit admins (maybe even provide them a utility to enable) that they have a troll that should be shadowbanned.
The public post might be configured to say something to the effect that "xxx user's tip has been processed and xxx is a # day redditor without any changetip configuration. This is the # time xxx has done this in the last 24 hours.  We're so sorry, but xxx MAY be a troll."
The trolls all seem to have just signed up for accounts and one that I looked at yesterday was spewing nearly 15 tips / minute all in the $10+ range.
Finding a way to be proactive against trolls helps the subreddits (they could maybe filter for your reports to know that they're not a disgruntled user... better yet, filter and allow an auto shaddowban)
Trolls posts that are followed with a community member having to point out that it's a troll makes the changetip system seem like 'another way for people to be jerks'... being proactive shows that you're serious and consider (and mitigate against) the downside of the system. Sort of a 'being a good community member" approach since the goal is to get expansion into other subreddits.

The article says that he admitted everything after being Mirandized. I'm wondering if he ever took possession of drugs or used them. If he was doing it purely as a market place provider, maybe his intent is to challenge the arrest?  For example, a web forum provider is not liable for the content on their sites, why would a market place provider be liable for the content on their site?  
Then again, maybe I'm giving him too much credit.

It was expected to top $1 at the first of the year, then settle back to mid-to-low $800s by end of Jan before returning to climbing.  So, this isn't really a crash. It's still settling back from the end-of-year/first-of-year gyrations that happen every year.

Clearly, you should not take this seriously at all... in fact, you really shouldn't buy any bitcoin. If you happen to already own some, you should probably sell as soon as possible.
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:40:46
The limits are imposed by regulatory requirements.  In the US, it was a state by state thing for them to be able to allow certain services.  I'm sure they have a significant team working on addressing regulatory requirements so eventually you'll be able to connect a bank account directly and have higher limits.
Coinbase is using the bank account as part of their Know Your Customer / Anit-Money Laundering compliance. That compliance is what is setting the limits.

There will also be a difference between buy and selling prices as well. But, I'm thinking that the price returned when you google "BTC to USD" is probably going to be pretty close.  Not sure where that price is sourced from.

Something I read in the last two days (sorry, can't pin it down more than that), expected a run up to $1100-$1200 range and then to settle back into the $800 range by end of January.  I wish I could remember the name of the person who published that expectation.  But, it seems that a few feel like $800 is a solid floor, but the current price may be temporary and once it pulls back, it will take at least half of next year to get back to the $900 range again, but they did expect it to get back to $1100 if not $1500 by end of 2017 calendar year.

Price increases due to collapse of production for a desired product is simply supply-demand scenario.  (when they quit making xyz dolls, they become expensive and potentially collector items).
Price increases due to currency supply in excess of production levels is hyperinflation (it means over inflated supply of currency).  Since everyone has too much money floating around in the system, the money buys less because people are willing to pay more for what they want. E.g. if you now earn $15k/day, you'd easily pay $15k for a new car... but so would everyone else... so the price of the car rises to max out profits for the car company and people are willing to pay more.  Hyperinflation was used by Germany to devalue a debt (say they owed 1000 DM (forget the real name or real amount) valued in DM, so printed a shit ton of the DM to pay it off.  This fucked the debt holder who got their "DM" but it wasn't worth toilette paper. But, it also fucked the current holders of DM at the same time.)

You can get a debit card to work straight from your bitcoin account in Coinbase.  Not sure the charges for that.  But, any time you move onto the financial networks (to/from the bank), you're going to be paying a fee because that network charges higher fees.

@_date: 2016-12-24 02:23:33
No, this is a debit card that is linked to one of your coinbase accounts so you can use bitcoin to buy stuff where debit cards are accepted.  Google "Shift card coinbase" and it should get you to the web page on their site. So far, the shift card is only possible in the states where they've finished meeting the regulations, but I think it's more than half of the states now.  The BTC is converted to fiat based on the current price at the time of sale.
EDIT: Here's the page. They list the states/territories where users can use the shift card at the bottom of the page. They have a link part way down the page to attach the shift card to your account.

Plenty of things CAN cause the value to plumet.  Selling and profit taking will push down the price (more people selling than people wanting to buy), but that's generally going to be temporary conditions.  E.g. A lot of people bought in the $200 range, now would be a good time for them to retrieve their original investment and leave the balance.  
Other things would be worse.  
- Countries making bitcoin illegal, especially if they're large countries with a lot of current adoption.  
- China saying "fuck it" with the yaun and going "to the moon!" on their yaun.  (Not likely because it will cut them off from their stated goals, but still possible)
- The EU members suddenly becoming enamored with the EU and willing to go down with the ship as a one large group.  There are a lot of major banks (especially German) who are in a bad situation with the EU.  If EU member states start bailing out of the currency, that will have bad rippling effects.  BUT, if somehow, all those member states declared "All for one and one for all!" they might stumble into a solid position of some sort that isn't known today.  But, as long as the EU is unstable, bitcoin will be attractive there.
-  There are a lot of blockchain projects backed by major players in the works. One of them could surface a non-recoverable flaw in the blockchain making the technology dead in the water.
Those are off the top of my head.  If you want to go totally paranoid, you could probably come up with volumes of potential disasters.
I'm interested in bitcoin as an actual currency (in addition to investment), so I try to get paid in bitcoin and I try to buy in bitcoin when ever possible.  I also do "income averaging" (buying a small amount each USD based payday) as an investment strategy.  I treat bitcoin much like a foreign currency (I lived in Germany and was paid USD but lived on the German economy in DM)... so, the up/down aspect of bitcoin is much like a foreign currency to me.  I only care about it when I need to switch between them. For the rest of the time, it's interesting... and I might buy/sell on a good price swing... but I don't go out of my way or go nuts chasing that sort of thing.

There are far more bitcoin out there now, so I think it would take a much bigger panic (or much bigger profit taking) to drive prices as far down as the last time.

I try to get my clients to pay me in bitcoin and give them a 10% discount if they do.  So, the $15 I was paid two months ago is actually worth more now.  Unfortunately, it can also work in the reverse and I've still given discounts for bitcoin.  By doing this, I've managed to get a lot of people to at least try bitcoin and become familiar with it. My average project price is far higher than $15 and makes a 10% discount significant enough to learn bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-24 02:37:12
From stuff I've read, I'm going with the person who expects BTC to settle back around $800 by end of Jan, then do steady climb again possibly reaching $1500 by end of year.
$5k or prices like that are people who say that at the last halvening, 6mo later the price went up 13x the price.  Part of what MIGHT be driving this surge is that BTC is being created at a slower pace, so when there is a spike in demand, the only way to settle it is to see a price increase until demand dies back again closer to the BTC generation rate.  The recent news is creating more demand because more people are checking it out or buying back in. That news will wane and the demand with it.  Then, there will be people taking profits from the run up. That will cause the price to fall back again.
On the good side, most seem to think that $800USD is a pretty stable new floor for BTC.

My brokerage accounts calculate all those taxable gains for me and gives me a report at the end of the year.  Look for Coinbase to provide the same services in the near future.
Also, you spend bitcoin because you have more bitcoin than cash available. :-)
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:42:30
Coinbase accounts can have a shift card associated to them, so you can spend from your bitcoin denominated account like any other bank account using the debit card.  (the BTC are sold at current market rates to pay the USD to the vendor)  So, vendors don't have to take bitcoin for you to use it.  The biggest prob with the shift card is that it's limited to $200 cash withdraw and $1000 purchasing per day. But, if you can live within those limits and are willing to pay the $10 fee to get the shift card, bitcoin is no harder to spend than any other bank account.

Several large US banks have banked terrorists and drug lords... as I remember, they got small fines and a wag of the finger over it. 
Coinbase is just a company, it is not bitcoin.  If it were to implode tomorrow, buying pressure would ease up for the time that it takes people to find other avenues to buy on.  Square is jumping into the game with a prototype already out there.  The second largest ATM manufacturer, with established machines in South Korea, is jumping into the international market with a software upgrade to their existing ATMs (they're second most common ATM in gas stations and places like that in the US)... so, buying is not going to be "cut off" like it might have been 2 years ago.  Square has selling.  The ATM mfg would likely need a physical machine upgrade to provide selling.  Wallets are free for the download.  So, life would be slowed down until people established new techniques to do what Coinbase is doing for them.  Many countries do not have Coinbase at all so would not be affected by anything beyond price impact.

coinbase is federally regulated and has institutional investors that would get serious blow back.  as a regulated company, they have pretty constant reporting requirements and periodic audit requirements.  so it would be hard for them to just close their doors (fold) and there would be prosecution and massive litigation if it even hinted at a scam technique. given that they're now providing hedge fund fiduciary services... i'm guessing that there is little risk of them folding.

The different addresses are for privacy.  BUT, when say you received 90 payments of 0.1BTC and later want to send 1BTC somewhere... your wallet will have to pull together 10 addresses + 1 address for fees to make up the transaction... so, the transaction will be 11x the size and the mining fee will reflect that.  OTOH... if privacy isn't such a big issue for you, then reusing the single address will result in lower mining fees when you go to transfer it somewhere else because the total amount needed to send will be coming from a single address.

You will have a USD acccount on Coinbase.  Selling BTC to that account is instant and has a conversion fee.  Selling the BTC to an associated bank account is also instant w conversion fee, but the ACH system will take 7-8 calendar days for the funds to be available in your bank account.  (It's 5 business days, so if you sell on Mon, you'll have it Fri and any other day will give you a weekend to deal with then there are holidays also)
If you pay $10 for a Shift debit card, you can use it up to $1k purchases or $200 atm withdraw.  Those convert BTC to USD at the time of transaction. So, in theory you could put $200/day cash into your bank account that way.

So, it's like if your UPS service moved you package only 1 step of the shipping (pickup, sending terminal, flight, delivery terminal, local office, truck) each day.

I don't think you can say we're in a mass adoption phase until the news is covering reviews of different bitcoin services providers.  Right now, they don't even understand what a bitcoin is.  At best, we're moving to the end of the early adopters phase.
In cell phone terms, we're in the 1980s.  ( relevant commercials  )

If you're in the US, LBC is dangrous.  That would cross the line into money exchanger (USD $10k) (money laundering) and would also be dangerous as fuck to meet with a stranger who knows you're carrying $10k.  AND, the police can take large sum of cash from you claiming that they think you're trafficking drugs and you'll never see it again (see civil asset forfeiture).  In short... do not carry large sums of cash that you cannot 100% show proof of where you got it (as in a selfie with a bank clerk 5 minutes prior along with the receipt for the withdraw from your bank account and the ad for the car that you're going to buy).

how many people have had access to the back (private keys)... it wouldn't take much in cpu cycles to monitor those addresses for a balance and when one shows up, move it to your own address.  I personally would burn them or at least put a massive black mark over the addresses in permanent marker.

I just looked at gold prices back to 1995 and it has never been over $2k.  It's now running in the $1.2k range and there was some podcast crowing about the amazing rally gold was in, climbing up a whole $15.   I will give gold one thing... it is boring as fuck.

Not worth the click, written by an idiot with no clue.  By this logic, no stock has value either since stock holders are not putting additional liquidity into the market.
TL/DR:  If two people bid bitcoin up to $100k it won't matter to you because you didn't put in $100k for the coin you hold so the $100k is an illusion. And for all you sorry folks who bought in the $800 range... sorry, you won't be able to sell at today's price because "logix"!

I knew someone who had the car battery sized brick w/a corded handset attached to it.  He lugged it everywhere and loved showing it off.  It was nearly 10 pounds and hugely ugly.  To me... bitcoin is barely past that stage at this point.  It's still complicated and ugly.  (And, I'm a long term tech geek saying that.  Imagine when I'm trying to explain it to my non-tech friends who's eyes glaze over at even "2FA")

As a person w/decades of auditing financial institutions... the CEO doesn't have access to do those things... so, he can kill off all the staff (not my area of expertise), but as an audited financial institution, he won't be able to sell off customer bitcoin unless he's a closet genius the likes of which the world has never seen.

Bitcoin is definitely not for people trying to overcome dopamine addiction (the basis of many addictions).... in gambling, it isn't winning or losing that causes the addiction, it's the state of expectation... I think they could cure 90% of gamblers by giving them a bitcoin wallet.  When it goes into a stable state like the last couple days... I go into withdraw symptoms cuz, I want it to do SOMETHING!

Very specific to holding your own keys... once you have a coinbase account, read their information about their "multi-signature vault" services.  This service allows you to both "keep your own keys" and also have a backup of a federally regulated company with institutional investors (so, they are not going to flush their reputation over a scam).
VERY SHORT VERSION:
"keeping your own keys" means that YOU have the PRIVATE KEY for the PUBLIC address where your bitcoin are stored.  Anyone can see the public address and people send bitcoin TO that address.  Only the holder of the PRIVATE KEY can send bitcoin FROM that address.
Multi-signature addresses have more than one private key and require a set number of those private keys to approve sending money from the address.  Typically, there will be three PRIVATE keys and two will be needed to send money from that address.  (So, two signatures by associated private keys are needed). 
Coinbase's Multi-Signature Vault puts your bitcoin on a known address with three PRIVATE keys and requiring TWO signatures (by two private keys).  
- Coinbase keeps one private key on file.  
- Coinbase encrypts a second private key using a password provided by you.  They keep it on their system and it's available to you to download.  
- The third private key is sent to you to store as you see fit.
If you download the encrypted key (2nd key), then you can sign and send bitcoin without any further action by Coinbase.  If you lose everything (house, car burn to the ground)... Coinbase can still send that bitcoin for you as long as you still know the password to decrypt they 2nd key that is stored on their system.

1/16th of the total supply of a limited asset is destroyed... the price of the remaining assets would increase.  The impact on price would be a "negotiation" between people pissed at a company and people who recognize that the underlying asset has now been further limited.  I'm not a guru so cannot even guess what would happen price wise.

They're complying with anti-money laundering laws.  Gambling is a common way to launder money. 
And, it was an automated system that tagged the user.  They (especially governments) identify bitcoin addresses associated with known sites and they use them to make a sort of blacklist to monitor for.

Criticality of replay protection.  Look at the BCH / BTC shitstorm right now.  This is going to be a continuing (growing?) problem that in the long run may end up regulated.  
Look at current HIPAA type regulations, they mandate baseline protections.  The "hammer" for cryptocurrency regulations could be potential for fraud charges.
AND before people start stomping me... I'm not promoting regulations, I'm saying that when you have a percentage of the population "losing" money to a feature of an application, it is going to draw attention.  Establishing effective replay protections and quantifying industry best practices NOW will go a long way toward dealing with the issue.  The entire CISSP certification processes started out as ISO standards that started out as country standards.  Those standards had to start somewhere with someone who started looking at the issues pragmatically.  Part of that is quantifying the forms of protection and their effectiveness, and their computational costs.  Establishing a process to do this will be valuable to both insurance companies insuring these businesses and financial institutions evaluating the risk of forks and new types of cryptocurrency.

It was picked up by a squatter who ended up selling for $250k to garcia (paycoin). Not sure who bought it next because garcia had trouble keeping up with the payments so it might have defaulted back to the orig squatter or ver might have bought it from garcia.
It has always been a scam site.
edit- this is wrong it was btc.com that he bought
