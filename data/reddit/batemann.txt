What was the address you sent the bitcoin to?
It seems rather strange that your transaction never showed up on the blockchain. Of course it did, someone did get that money, just not the store management.

How do you know that the fees would be less than those charged by Western Union/Moneygram?
If I was sending money from the USA to India, there would be a fee associated with getting my USD to bitcoins (either in the form of a poor exchange rate or an explicit fee), and then there would be another fee when I would convert the bitcoins into Indian Rupees...

When I first heard of Bitcoin, I thought that it could be come something that solves this sort of problem.
But does bitcoin REALLY solve this problem? Even with bitcoin, I'm paying fees converting my USD to BTC, depending on the exchange I use. There is a minimal fee for transferring the BTC to another address (not an issue), but when it gets there, it needs to be transferred back into fiat, which of course will result in fees and exchange rate losses.
So it doesn't really solve that problem.. does it? I guess the only other scenario I could think of was if it became a closed economy where goods could be purchased in bitcoin. 
What are your ideas, I'm curious to hear your opinions.

Why would I use bitcoins over Venmo?

In practical terms he really isn't rich -- he has no means to actually cash out on that fortune
