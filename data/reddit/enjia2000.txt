such is not the way of the internet.

We already have our own mining pool MtRed.com. I'm sure someone is working on it.
@_date: 2011-07-06 02:05:04
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
@_date: 2011-06-22 02:39:51
i'll upvote both your responses then. =]

I think 30$ a bitcoin was some dutch tulips actions, i'd explect it to hold around 15$
@_date: 2011-07-06 03:28:33
Surely those guys can pull better pranks then this?
also, Happy Birthday.

I love android devices and dropbox so i'm going to take a look at this, thanks!

Well you have to think too that as the profitablity goes down the number of people mining goes down, which makes profitablility go back up. Eventually I think it will hit a happy medium.
Right now your seeing the effects of people buying mining equipment when it was 30$/BTC. I've already seen people trying to pawn off their brand new mining equipment. I'll be surprised if it goes over 1mil difficulty. It's been holdng pretty steady at 877k

join mtred.com, it's reddit's pool. =]
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:22:27
I actually thought they handled it very professionally. My email was one on the list so I changed all my passwords that I care about. (I was overdue for this anyways) I didn't have any bitcoins on mtgox so I have 0 loss from the whole ordeal.

make a online currency using this method, i'd get behind it. =]

In 24 hours of mining you can expect about $1.50 with that card. Is it still worth it?
@_date: 2011-06-29 09:16:42
skynet downvoted me..... I was right...
@_date: 2011-07-06 01:43:35
heads I win, tails you lose.
@_date: 2011-06-24 19:38:29
how does one "issue trust"
@_date: 2011-06-29 19:04:54
that's just what skynet would say!
@_date: 2011-06-28 21:06:17
Your not the OP so I can only assume your one of the 'other guys' =]
@_date: 2011-06-16 01:51:31
Thanks for ruining it for the little guys, lol
@_date: 2011-06-28 20:25:51
SHA-512 would be better then SHA-256 but that should be secure enough. Good job.
@_date: 2011-06-24 05:55:52
Why should any bitcoin startup be trusted at this point?
@_date: 2011-06-21 22:54:20
Probably because computers see spaces like any other character.
'I love protecting my bitcoin wallet' is just as secure as 'iAloveAprotectingAmyAbitcoinAwallet' is just as secure I imagine. Length is the most important factor I believe personally. That's why PGP 'keys' are soooooo long.
@_date: 2011-06-17 20:31:50
I support your idea to start a bitcoin business but I can honestly say i'd never use it. The whole idea of bitcoin is to have a decentralized form of currency and it seems to me you just want to start a bank. =]
good luck though, i'm sure less tech-saavy people will go for it.
@_date: 2011-06-22 02:34:38
Well it's a good reminder that people need to be wary in their everyday lives. My email was on that list so i went ahead and chaged all my passwords and it's been on my mind because of it.
Nothing wrong with a little PSA.

Use a program like [Password Safe]( ) to make a password for you. You can install it to a thumb drive and set automatic backups as well.
Good security is having a different strong password for every site you care about. Paypal, bank, trading sites, etc..

simpsons have done everything...

Well maybe not so much as a degree, but at least taken a class on it for a CS degree.
@_date: 2011-06-29 07:56:04
Nice idea, I think you would get a lot more done though if you already had the book written. If your wife really wants to write why not start with a complete work?
Start with a short story and charge .3 BTC each and work your way up from there. Let the business pay for itself on the way up.
@_date: 2011-06-28 18:46:36
Do you have any kind of degree in encryption or computer science?
I'm not trying to sound mean but i don't trust any site after the mtgox debacle.
