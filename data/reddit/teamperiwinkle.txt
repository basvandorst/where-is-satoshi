How do you know they dont result in transfers?
@_date: 2016-08-31 18:19:03
Huh, well, if that's the case the i suppose you would know more and thus I have learned something new today
@_date: 2016-08-31 02:38:49
Many I'm sure
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:57:22
I would bet in that time period 100% of major banks were hacked

Ya, he’s hitting it like a cigar
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:56:13
I don't think he is saying it is. But it is. This is because exponential growth is  really never sustainable. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:56:23
He’s inhaling wrong right?
@_date: 2015-12-09 14:44:20
Nonsense, how else do you say that you run the bitcoin software as a participant in the network?
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:48:45
If I saw this back in 2014 i'd think I died.
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:13:12
Or better yet cash
@_date: 2014-04-05 05:40:55
I got into bitcoin as a kid (11) in 2011 and it was easy to get coins then. However I was mining on a home pc. It is interesting to see how times have changed and how bitcoin has evolved. In my mind it has gone from something traded like a commodity that is mostly just traded to something that is SEEN as a currency.
Edit:I did not quite mean currency but kinda.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:13:43

@_date: 2014-05-07 01:00:30
"young brilliant programmers" already know what bitcoin is. What we need is for bitcoin to go mainstream.

Where are you getting this?
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:55:35
How much would that cost in total, would someone produce the ad or would it just be the updated "what is bitcoin" video.

I have done this for a diffrentbreason but I kept a 1 in thick by 2 in wide neodymian magnet in my pocket. There are some issues for 1 you get stuck to all sorts of shit water fontions, walls, lamp posts, tables, cars. And also you can easlg forget about it and wipe a ton of laptop hdds
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:46:42
I feel like people would crash, likely into you.

@_date: 2014-04-06 17:24:26
I have, the above is also exceedingly difficult in 3rd world places.
You should read a bit and learn about context.
Also it was about geographic location not economics.

Ya I am a "kid" and I made some money from doing coding and whitehat. It was easy and I prefer it to PayPal. It is also good because then I don’t need any banking information.

Alright mr AimAtTheAnus have a nice day.
If you would like to have a real conversation about this you can PM me and we can talk.
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:29:18
Well coinbase does cold storage so it seems good.

I have looked at  and found that to advertise on prime time 30 times a month to somewhere populated like Austin Texas would only cost $3,000 a month. I could only spend maybe $200 on it but if anyone is interested PM me.

Bitcoin helps eliminate some of the greater evils of the finical system, for that reason I think that it is fine if it makes some smaller "bad" things easier.

Wow such a well composed argument.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:42:51
there are tons of bank information stealing trojans, also just encrypt your private key.

@_date: 2016-03-29 17:06:53
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:49:03
The idea is (somewhat) sound. It's basically a round about way to trade bitcoin futures with respect to change in hash rate. It just happens that mostly all of them are scams because nobody wants to bet against bitcoin and is intrested enough in running a cloud mining service. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:40:21
@_date: 2016-06-03 13:28:30
Well, that's not quite the case. There are many points ant which you can be attacked via mitm. For instance if you say run it over TOR or use a proxy or VPN, or you are targeted by someone who has access to your ISP.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:02:01
I doubt it would take more than a week or two for HBO. I would think they just have their cfo tell a random accountant to make it happen.

if you're trying to sell bolivars for btc, ill buy like 200K-500K with btc at a higher than market price.
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:02:14
What? That's not how any of it works
@_date: 2017-04-19 20:45:24
Did you ever have a mt.gox account?
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:11:24
I want to keep some Bolivars in my safe as a decoy with some other foreign currencies. Is the 100 bill common or if I go to an exchange will they give me a much bigger bill?

WHooo, what the fuck. THat is my bitcoin address.
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:19:23
Did you have a mt gox account?
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:54:20
Can you link the TX hash? It's possible that you included a dust transaction or something  silly like that. If you just sent a low fee then the transaction will just 'go' to who you sent it to, it will just take a bit
@_date: 2017-04-19 20:18:26
says he had a mt.gox account. I did as well. Did you?
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:37:48
Sure, give me a sec. Can you PM me the phishing page?
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:15:17
Hmm, do you know of anyone who sells Bolivars via cash in the mail for bitcoin or paypal?
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:53:20
I just want them for decoy money in my safe.
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:44:13
Pmed you.
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:34:57
The thought would be to hide the real currency in a hidden compartment and leave the decoy money out.
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:59:15
Perhaps not fully replace but to some extent supplement especially in fringe case (escaping capital controls and the like)

Ya, I'd at-least send from each wallet one at a time to hedge my potential fuck up.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:13:54
Well, if a client wanted to buy enron back in the day they would buy it for them it's not their job to stop you from buying things.

Would you call it, maybe, substandard?
@_date: 2018-07-21 21:01:44
He's quoted as saying the best application and the most salient application of cryptocurrency is doing things that are illegal but that perhaps that's not a bad thing.

Except for the fact that many VCs did invest in it back in 2011-2013. VC Chamath Palihapitiya has talked about how he and some other VCs owned 5% of avalible coins after buying it up for years in (IIRC) 2011

That is a possibility, however it seems odd that a clear case was opened if it was for the reasons you mentioned. But I do agree that it very well could be nothing. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 01:48:31
Ya, that site is most likely not the correct site. What url did you go to? Also, how much did you send?
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:37:07
What was that deleted comment?
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:37:35
Its worthless once it has been tampered with so I am hoping someone will give me theirs. Also I don't know that mine will be tampered with. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 02:49:52
Well, I can get a hash of the firmware then check it against a genuine copy. Also, if it does not give me the code that it says it is running, how would it run it?

Gbtc is not the same as btc/10 it's a little more complicated iirc.
@_date: 2015-03-28 19:51:03
If you send me yours (seeing as it is now useless) I would love to investigate and see what (if anything) was done to it
@_date: 2017-07-15 02:27:28
A not very smart person called also use Bitcoin anonymously if they just spend an hour reading about it
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:41:05
I think I have one or two of those, lol.
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:31:16
I don't plan to analyze it that way.

Not to upstage you but I started mining when i was 11.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:49:51
Not to be negitive but I think that for bow it is too risky bc the volatility

Do it
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:32:43

May I have your username after this? or may I buy it from you?
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:48:01
it was me who made the bots, I think my mistake was using a catchall method that was randomstrings but good contest next time I would use a capacha. how did you like it?
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:38:37
You should be okay it was only 1 min but I would mabey transfer all funds to a new wallet
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:46:45
If you do CHANGE THE SSH PASSWORD what ever you do people will leave raspberry pies in coffee shops that try the default ssh password on any device that joins the network. so ya stay safe
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:53:58
someone could just sit in a coffee shop and wait for hipsters with jail broken  iphones then ssh all new devices on the network with the default ssh password.
So no they never where
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:36:12
Also I just registerd with many accounts, you didn’t say you cant do that. so what rule am I breaking?
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:28:03
He mentioned FDIC, that is an American institution, I assume he is American.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:06:41


ATM it steals emails passwords cookies etc, Iam sure that it would used for stealing bitcoin if possible.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:26:30

or should I just upload a run script and the class files
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:06:01
I didn’t cheat,  you said nothing about bots. you should make rules next time. Also doing a simple task programmatic does not make someone bad at programming.

@_date: 2013-11-25 00:05:38
Don't do a brain wallet. Also keep the laptop in a firebox and offline, not just with the wifi off in settings turn it off in the BIOS, I can tell you how to do that if you need.

There always is litecoin if you are really set on building a badass rig
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:55:07

People will leave them in a coffee shops because they are small, it could be any type of computer.

Ya I can later but i am on my phone atm.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:44:14
Also can we know the details of the bot?
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:01:14
True, I think they should I was just trying to think of a reason why they wouldn’t
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:03:10
Good luck. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:10:00
