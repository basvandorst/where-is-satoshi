It might be possible, if they did a quick format, doesn't erase anything, but writing to it will overwrite data.  If it has been years, I would not put too much faith in having it recovered, but worth a try, cuz... that's like 4k or more.

It's possible, what kind of format did you do?  and has it been written to since the format?

You have no clue of what you are talking about do you.

Well, not sure you want to pay a "pro", unless they have really expensive equipment (costly to hire), they will most likely just run the same programs you can get for free or low cost.  If they are professionals, they wouldn't steal your btc, probably not worth the bad rep.

Imagine water going for $0.05/gallon.  Now imagine only one gallon of water in the world.  What would people pay for it?  This is a silly example, but shows you what how supply and demand influences pricing.  I would be wary of btc investment though.

Well, you can always escrow if it's a large amount, or just make sure you're trading with a legit person for smaller amounts.

I'll explain why bitcoin should raise a red flag.  The number of bitcoin is fixed, which means, the value changes as investors hoard bitcoins and as more economies use bitcoin.  An economy run on bitcoin would not function properly, as the value would fluctuate too much (the reason why federal reserves exist).  As more economy adapts to bitcoin, bitcoin will increase in value, drastically, furthered by investors buying into bitcoin, out of sheer greed... then guess what?  You heard of derivatives?  You know, the big crash that almost took out the world economy?  It won't be that drastic, since bitcoin has limits on it's growth, but those assholes that got rich during the crash?  They're at it again, this time, using bitcoin.  Those stupid enough to invest in bitcoin... well, you been warned.

No, that would make the total possible valuation of bitcoin of $21 trillion, add to that velocity of money, I'm going to assume that you're talking about $210 trillion dollars or more.

Oh, well, as stated above, if btc becomes popular, I'm sure btc escrows will start popping up, and if they specialize in btc, they will be accepting btc or cash for the fee, I'm going to assume.

Legitimate escrows allow both parties are adhering to the agreement they have with each other and protects both sides assets, in exchange for a small fee.  Who knows, btc escrows might start popping up, if not already if btc becomes more popular.

I just did, read it.  Bitcoin will increase, probably multiple folds, but you need to know when that will collapse, and you want detailed analysis, you need to pay me a salary. :P
