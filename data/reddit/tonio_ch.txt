Is it possible to generate this same graphic in term of hash power? This is hazardous to just compare the number of nodes. Bitcoin Unlimited may be ahead in term of hash power.
Also, to me, it seems more that it is just an upgrade, not a signal that they support segwit.

Even if I'll not adopt the same strategy as you and I will not sell directly all of one of my coins, I salute your maturity to not boycott one of them because of some ideology.
I would be really happy if more people were thinking like that and accept a split. Whatever sides you are, you have no benefit to boycott/jeopardise/whatever the other side. You just should be happy that both side have a coin that they trust and will follow. This is the real freedom that Bitcoin/Bitcoin cash/Bitcoin XT/Bitcoin Classic/Bitcoin somethingelse is!

I also think this split is a good thing as we will see what happen with both solutions. We will have more than just speculation of what could happen. What is even better is that if one of them doesn’t work, we still have the second chain.
Some cry because Bitcoin (both chains) lose value, I must say this is a fair price to pay to be sure to have a strong network.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:52:44
Right, I helped two friends to enter in bitcoin recently. It was really smooth for the first one but a total nightmare with the second. The difference is that the second one wanted to understand how it was done and how it can be secure. The first one just trust blindly the system.

Is your client fully synchronised? It seems that msigma download the whole chain. May take some time to see your transaction appears. Maybe try to let the client open and wait.

This is the relevant part of the mempool: [Top 1MB of transactions](
If your transaction is located in this portion of the mempool, it'll be processed in the next block (almost certainly). This means, at this time, you have to pay more than 700 sat/B or, for an ~~average~~ median transaction of 250B: 175'000 sat. At the current rate, this is more than 11$.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:47:44

@_date: 2017-11-20 20:14:56
It's not a BCH wallet by default. A BCH wallet is created by default, in ADDITION to the BTC wallet. This second wallet also use the same derivation path as the BTC wallet. The purpose of that is that if someone send the wrong coin, it appears anyway in the app.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:27:22
You may try to import your recovery seeds in an other wallet. [Like this](
It's really strange that the transaction appeared in the wallet then disappears. Can you maybe share the public address in which the BTC currently are and the one in which you expect them to be to see if there was transfer between them or something? (Be warned, doing this will expose you balance. Think first if you're ok with this)

@_date: 2017-11-10 17:16:00
This seems to me to be a wrong solution. Why not make something to decrease the fee to make at least affordable to open a channel even if it not affordable to use bitcoin directly on the blockchain?
And moreover, it's nice to have a concept like this. But when will I be able to use it? At the pace at which the fees increase, I will not be able to empty some of my addresses. Mainly the ones I used while buying a bit everyday. It cost already way to much to get the bitcoins out from these one.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:23:54
This has nothing to do with Segwit. This is just luck.
If you fill a block with small transactions with only one input and one output, you'll be able to have a lot more transactions than that.
Segwit was only able to increase the size of this block by 1.1%... This correspond about to 12% of the 0.7MB increase expected with 100% segwit transactions.
EDIT: Did the math. With only transaction of the minimum size (166B), you can fit theoretically more than 6000 tx in a single block without segwit and this would results to more than 850'000 tx per day with "perfect" block every 10min or ~10tx/s.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:53:07
Thanks. If I understood right, this is not Segwit specifically that is needed but a way to resolve malleability. Segwit happens to do that.

@_date: 2017-11-14 15:42:09
The requested amount is not part of bitcoin per see. It's just add some information around your address to auto-fill the send amount in the sender wallet.
For exemple, I generate to receiving adress with the same pubkey: [Qr code](
If you scan the first one, no amount will be set, if you scan the second, 0.001 will be automatically set in the amount field. (you can try, just don't confirm).
If you scan with a qr code scanner, you'll get:




As you can see, the requested amount just add "?amount=0.001" at the end of the address but this information is only proceeded by the sender wallet, not the BTC network.

It may be misleading for a dyslexic and color blind. The app clearly say "bitcoin" and "bitcoin cash" as well as using different colors.
This is even more "noob" friendly because if they give the wrong address to receive one of the coin, they get it anyway. No need to create a new account in the wallet and change the derivation path from 0H to 145H or the other way around as in any other wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:32:19
Not directly. In bitcoin, only the sender pay for the transaction. Imagine you want to exchange BTC to ETH on shapeshift:
* You send BTC, you pay the tx fees
* Shapeshift sends ETH, they pay the tx fees
I said not directly because, in the case of services like shapeshift, their expense in the ETH transaction is included in their rate. What I mean is that their rate is less favorable for you compared to exchanges rate so that they are able to make a profit with their service even though they have to pay for the second transaction. See that as if the withdrawal fee you see on classic exchanges are included in the rate of Shapeshift

([here]( for the full issue on this example.)
I see what you mean. The promotion made by Ver on the r/btc forum is effectively of the same kind and it should not be done by a moderator of the sub.
Now, even if it does promote is own website, which is clearly a conflicts off interest, this is still a big news concerning the Bitcoin Cash world. In any case, Ver don't seems to moderate that much on the sub and is in the moderator list for historical reason. Maybe he should be removed. This will assure that post like this are not bump to the top because of shady maneuver.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:43:05
You are perfectly right. And this is what this wallet does. It use the same key for both wallet. Send by mistake 1BTC to a BCH address in this wallet? No problem, the BTC reached the wallet anyway.

You can try to do a RBF fee transaction. However, based on the [recommended fee]( it will cost you 11.50$. Almost 50% of your input...
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:09:31
I'm sorry for you. Just wait then. Eventually, you'll get lucky and your transaction will be inserted in a block.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:25:13
You may try to do a RBF transaction. I don't now if it's possible to do it directly in the blockchain wallet however. If not, you can export your key to electrum then follow [this guide](
Is it the blockchain wallet that set this really low fee ( 17 sat/B )?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:58:11
Why? This is the cold true facts. You have to pay to get confirmed. If you don't pay enough, you're not on the top of the line and your transaction will not be processed. My support of BCH has nothing to do in this, it's the same in both implementation. Can you give us your transaction number or the at least fee you paid? We will be able to see were your transaction is located in the mempool and see why it was not confirmed. If you effectively paid too less fees, you can use the RBF ([BIP125]( option.
Also, I found my answer for the timeout: 14 days.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:22:05
I don't think it's because of spam. If you look at the [top 1MB of the mempool]( , you'll see you have to pay 700 sat/B (~11$ per tx) to get in the next block. The lower part of the mempool is irrelevant since these transactions will never be processed. I guess you just didn't pay enough fee...
Also, how much time does it need to a transaction to be "kicked out of the system"?

Ok, get it. I'll don't change my mind but you made me realize that the people I call "shill" on the other sub may just be people like me that were given their opinion. An opinion I was not agreeing, but still their opinion.
It's the first time someone said I was astroturfing. Passed the first shock, I understand why you said that, I was kind of provocative...
Anyway, my main goal here, on reddit in general, is just to say what I think. Not to "misguide" or anything. People should just do their diligent work and think/search about what they read: My opinion matters to them?/Am I right?/Am I false?/Should they care about what random people say? I can't control that in the same way I can't control what my opinion is. So, if my points are taken as propaganda, so be it. If they are taken as an argument, let's talk about it!
If you feel like I try to misguide people, I'm sorry but it's just because I have a different opinion. I think I'm at least as misguiding to you as you are to me. The good point of this is that there is different opinions and this means that we are not under a dictatorship regime which force our opinion, I'll take that for me.

[Here, right?](
I think it's just a bug in the data acquisition. My guess is the nodes from which these data come crashed at 18:40 and restarted at 18:55. This will explain the straight line from 60MB to 0MB (no data during this time, empty at restart). When it rebooted, it re-downloaded the mempool while prioritizing the high fee transactions (you can see that at 18:56, almost all 20+ sat/B transactions are there and then comes the other ones).
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:42:43
How can we know it is spam transaction? I was trying to empty ~15 paper wallet with not that much on them. It was ridiculous to pay 10-20% of fee to do that. So, since it don't need to be fast, I just pay low fee and hopefully it will be proceed. If not, I'll try again in two weeks.
Am I a spammer? Think about that. lot's of transaction with low fee may just be people wanting to move coins at the best price with no need of a fast transaction.
