Romney can still do that anonymously. It’s actually better than a private deal.

Have you tried seeding anything via Tor? It’s tedious and difficult to get right.
It’s not rocket science, though. It’s just not worth the hassle. Taking the easier approach doesn’t make them incompetent.

You can just start the client in a sandbox. But there are other issues besides leaking the IP: you have to stay online long enough to announce and seed the file (which theoretically opens you to various timing attacks), you’re at the mercy of the clearnet gateways (traffic filtering, no incoming connections), etc. Uploading offline is just more convenient.

The same reason it’s a slideshow.

And how do you seed the torrent anonymously? It’s far easier to just dump it somewhere once and let others create the torrent.

It’s Bitcoin. You can do that anonymously from your bedroom. Because it’s public, anyone can do that, including Romney’s supporters. OTOH, if it was a private deal, the details of the deal would much more damaging that the leak itself.

It doesn’t have to be stored, you only need the full blockchain if you want to be able to verify its integrity independently. Once verified the transaction history can be discarded. You can just take a snapshot at any point in time and calculate the balance for every valid address and update the balance as new blocks are accepted by the network.
It comes down to what do you do when you join the network for the first time:
  1. Download the entire block chain from its very beginning and verify its integrity independently. 
  2. Only get snapshot of the current state of the network by *trusting* some 3rd party. 
As the time goes on the first option will become more and more expensive and less realistic. 
So massive amounts of transactions is not really that much of a problem. At some point clients will have to start discarding the entire history and treat as an archive. The more popular Bitcoin becomes the quicker it will happen. New clients joining the network will either *have* to trust someone or they will have to pay quite a bit in resources (time, processing power, storage space) to perform their own audit.
