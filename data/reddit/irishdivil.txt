Hi Matthew this is great to see people from Northern Ireland here on Reddit and being so supportive! I'm a wee bit away from Belfast myself, but once we are fully up and running we will be looking to accommodate the community here who can't travel to the meet-ups in all sorts of ways. One idea i've been looking at is Tinychat, but i won't make any definite decisions until we get the community built up and get a mutual consensus on theses things. I really want this affiliate chapter to be for the community in N.Ireland and not become a hierarchy type organisation like has happened in other communities. I'm looking forward to your help and support in the future and thanks for commenting, it's a confidence builder as i feel N.Ireland has been left behind somewhat in regards to crypto compared to the rest of the UK and Ireland and that was one of my main reasons for setting up the affiliate chapter here. If anyone wants to contact me my email is niall website should be up in a few days, i'll update here and please spread the word!

Thanks for the offer of support Smyf, pleasure to meet you and i'm sure you can contribute in the future as we move forward. Until the website goes live in a few days you can get me on twitter  or the forums crypto2coins.com for more info. There will be an official announcement soon from the International Foundation. I'm just trying to get the word out and gather support at the moment because it's the crypto community that brought Bitcoin to where it is now, and this affiliate chapter is for the N.Ireland community. We shall be organising monthly meet-ups for 2015 so i'm sure we will meet. Thanks again for showing your support Smyf and i look forward to us all coming together to protect. educate and create a thriving crypto ecosystem here!

Hi CryptoBudha, i just signed the company up to accept Bitcoin through Bitpay. You can contact the owner David he's very crypto friendly @ support he or his staff would be more qualified than me to answer those sort of questions. Any about my process registering the corporation i'd be more than happy to answer.

Your welcome hackis! And no you can't use fake info as it's all checked and verified through government agencies like HMRC.

Hi 1blockologist and thanks, i just contacted Bitpay to let them know there seems to be a global demand for these sort of services accepting Bitcoin. Hopefully we will see more soon and i would like to see people in the UK support this firm to show there is a demand for it!

Only if the company/corporation is being based in the UK hackis. I registered the Bitcoin Association Northern Ireland through the site, the costumer service is 2nd to none. Once you pay the initial registration fee at the beginning, there's no other fees ever! You can check your company exists once registered at

Hi CryptoBudha, I've been talking to the owner today and read him your post, so you should see him on here later this afternoon to answer any questions you all have!

You seem to have an ego problem bitnumus and are making yourself look like an egotistical prick on here still going on about a post over two weeks old! if you want to contribute something useful to the community other than bullshit and a price ticker please PROVIDE PROOF OF ONE BITCOIN EXCHANGE THAT HAS BEEN OR IS A FCA REGULATED IN THE UK? You've stated more than enough on this thread that there has been, NOW SHOW US THE PROOF AND SAVE ANY CREDIBILITY YOU HAVE LEFT?

I believe the answer to this problem of perception is in the question wy94cWq, people fear what they don't understand.
