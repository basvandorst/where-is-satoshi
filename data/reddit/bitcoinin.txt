I've been digging into ledger, but am having a hard time tracking capital gains.  Are you tracking your realized capital gains or simply tracking your net realized+unrealized gains?
@_date: 2012-12-21 10:58:57
Yes, you can proceed with the order and we can fix any problems without charging you for shipping twice.  Our suspicion is that the mystery book that refuses to be priced in the cart might be an inventory issue, but if it is showing up in your cart it should be registered with your order and we'll be able to determine whether we can get you a copy.
@_date: 2012-11-28 21:13:16
We utilize a number of Amazon's services, though we can't compete with their inventory which is why we have affiliate links over to them for items that we can't get from our suppliers.  We're starting with books because of existing relationships we had and released the site while we're still building it so that we could get a handle on our fulfillment processes while also hopefully building a positive reputation in the community.  We are working on expanding to many other product groups, however.

As a thank you to those that made purchases or provided feedback during our initial launch and to celebrate Bitcoin's first halving, Bitcoinin is having a **Halving Day Sale** with the prices of all books reduced today only!  You'll probably also notice a number of improvements and tweaks to the site - many based upon feedback we received.  More is coming soon - including international shipping!

The BitcoinTalk announcement is coming shortly - we're just trying to roll this out as smoothly as possible by being able to quickly tackle questions or potential problems right away instead of unleashing the entire Bitcoin community through the gates at once.
@_date: 2012-11-21 19:56:37
What we're trying to emphasize is the fact that:
1. we're offering goods that no one has offered for Bitcoin up until now
2. we didn't just slap a Bitcoin module on top of an existing shopping cart system - we don't fault those merchants that go this route, but we're looking to provide a pure Bitcoin shopping experience unencumbered by the bloat of traditional payment method requirements.
@_date: 2012-11-28 14:08:39
This year we couldn't quite make 50% off everything work financially :)  At the next halving in 4 years, though, we'll hopefully have all kinds of items at 50% off.

Speaking as a Bitcoin ecommerce store, I'd love a proper version of an ecommerce rating site - for Bitcoin-focused stores.  The current (non-Bitcoin) options for these kinds of services are generally scammy and more focused on getting customers to start using their price comparison functionality than actually trying to increase trust in the store and the rating site.
I'd love a badge I could stick on the front page that says something like "Buy-With-Bitcoins Approved" ("approved" because the site meets certain criteria) which could link to a trusted ratings site that lists all of the customer reviews and then also add a "Please rate your shopping experience" link upon checkout.  Even better if I could include some sort of signed transaction ID in the link so that "Verified Purchase"s could be displayed and weighted higher to cut down on fake reviews.
In the same way that the community benefits by having access to a trusted source of reviews for purchasing Bitcoins, it could also benefit by having some place they trust to check that the site they're purchasing items *with* Bitcoins is legit.
@_date: 2012-12-20 13:17:05
Excellent stuff - thanks for writing this up.
@_date: 2012-12-17 13:38:34
We're investigating the cart bug now.
Ideally we will add something like a "Saved Items" list which out of stock and Wish List-type items could be added and also backordering where out of stock items can be purchased and will be shipped as soon as they get back in stock (once we have better stock estimates).
If you have any other questions/suggestions, please let us know!

Are you still paying all of your employees with Bitcoin?  I'm sure it isn't a problem for Alex, but have you had any problems with employees or prospective employees accepting Bitcoin for their wages?  or do you offer some sort of immediate conversion option?
@_date: 2012-11-22 13:06:28
Thank you for the support and advice.  We are in this for the long haul and would be fine with a slower growth that allows us to build support in the community while also allowing us to more firmly establish the infrastructure required to service the orders coming in.
We are approaching everything very conservatively, but we are also capable and prepared to quickly ramp things up if the demand does exist.
@_date: 2012-11-23 15:36:14
No, though we are pegging pricing in that way and, in order to offer the largest selection possible, will sometimes use their fulfillment service when we can't get the item via our suppliers at a better price point.  We are a startup offering products to a market of mostly unknown size or demand which makes committing to wholesaler requirements or sales quotas impossible at this point.  Once we have a better idea of the demand this kind of service has, we'll be able to negotiate better terms with our existing suppliers and pull in others with greater inventories.
@_date: 2012-11-21 19:41:50
We have considered this and longer term we might build a more gentle Bitcoin introduction into the site to convert the uninitiated, but for now we want to focus purely on serving the expanding Bitcoin userbase to supply them with the goods that they can't currently get in exchange for Bitcoin.  
One of our biggest assets is showing how much easier an online shopping and checkout process can be with Bitcoin - not making you register, not requiring that you fill out a ton of forms, and not ending up on a retailer's mailing list just because you happened to make one purchase.  All you have to do is provide bare-bones shipping info, send the payment, and your goods are on the way.  We may be wrong and may lose out on some sales that we could have made via traditional payment methods, but having to complicate the simplicity by displaying USD/BTC conversions or having "how do you want to pay?" questions in the way would probably turn away more potential Bitcoin users than convert them because they'd simply say "So what? Why would I use Bitcoin when I just used my credit card?"
Finally, Bitcoin provides a number of cost benefits for an online retailer by reducing the costs involved in accepting payment.  We want to be able to leaverage these benefits to drop our prices to the absolute lowest levels we can.  If we were to also accept traditional payment methods we would have to compensate for those additional costs.
If you'd like to support us, but don't have or want to use your Bitcoins you can use the "Compare to Amazon" links on the site to purchase items with your usual payment methods and we get a small affiliate return on the sale.
@_date: 2012-11-22 14:22:36
We are a couple of Bitcoiners+Redditors from Minnesota who have backgrounds in programming/web/retail.  I have a mining rig in my basement, have always wanted to be able to purchase more things directly with Bitcoin, and we finally decided to just try to make it happen ourselves.
The other driving force behind making this happen is our long-existing hate for the hoops you have to jump through to accept traditional payment methods online and the problems that arise with existing payment processors.

@_date: 2012-12-21 20:31:25
The documentation doesn't have the best examples for this use case.  First I was hoping that there was some way to configure auto-matching of lots (ie FIFO).  I was then having trouble listing the balance of the lots to make the manual lot selection more sane.  The key seems to be selecting lots with both the price and date - otherwise you can't produce the current lot balances to match with.
I think I've gotten things set up the way it should be and producing the output I'm expecting.  A huge thanks for pointing Ledger out - this is way more manageable than other solutions I've tried.

Thanks for continuing to check our site first.  We're working hard on getting our infrastructure and additional relationships in place to be able to better compete.  We have some big updates planned for the next couple of months.
@_date: 2012-11-21 20:17:24
We're approaching our storefront from the standpoint of an ideal "This is how an online Bitcoin store should work".  Maybe we went too far with not having reference USD pricing, but we didn't think that an online Bitcoin store should have to straddle the line between currencies.  We also don't want to have constantly adjusting prices where one minute your total comes to 2.45 BTC and the next minute the total adjusts to 2.53.  If we get more feedback like this, though, we will have to re-evaluate.
Direct downloads is something that other sites are tackling - and tackling fairly well we thought - so for now we don't have plans to offer them as we're focused on offering something that doesn't currently exist.
@_date: 2013-01-16 12:56:47
Awesome to see Bitcoin retail getting publicity.
@_date: 2013-03-01 14:01:24


At [Bitcoinin]( we haven't seen this problem.  Obviously we can't do a direct comparison against a theoretical environment identical to ours except that the currency is inflationary so perhaps spending isn't as high, but I can tell you that customers are interested in using Bitcoin.  You get all the benefits of Bitcoin transactions, you get better - or at least comparable - pricing, since the purchasing power continues to increase you can see that you're able to purchase more now than you could previously, and you're supporting the greater Bitcoin economy which helps ensure that the value of the coins that you are stashing away will continue to increase.
@_date: 2013-01-11 19:18:01
Yes - if you have transferred Bitcoins to your "brainwallet" - a Bitcoin address generated by a complex password that you've memorized - then attempting to confiscate those assets is essentially impossible without your consent.  There are similar circumstances that courts encounter:
1. A bank robber who stole 1 million dollars is caught but only 100k is recovered.  Is the other 900k buried somewhere that only the robber knows how to dig up at some point in the future?
2. An encrypted laptop is suspected or known to contain evidence of a crime.  Can the court compel the owner to produce the password to decrypt it?
The national laws and individual circumstances have a huge impact on what the courts can do (if anything) to compel/punish you for knowledge that you allegedly have and while there have been some test cases for these kinds of issues, most countries have a lot of grey area.
@_date: 2013-02-21 18:40:01
Yes, we do ship to China.  
For any international shipment, please make sure that your local laws allow you to import the items you're purchasing, understand that you will be responsible for any import taxes owed to your country and understand that the products are coming from America so things like power cords may not be compatible.  If you have any other questions please let us know!
@_date: 2013-02-21 17:00:44
Yes, the prices on items are pegged to the USD cost since that is what we have to pay our suppliers (though we'll be working on that...)
Prices will update periodically when there are changes in the market, but we try to keep the pricing as stable as possible so that you shouldn't see prices change on you while you're shopping unless there are significant changes in the price.

1. There are a number of ideas/projects around with varying degrees of security and reliance on internet access.   is an example that doesn't require internet access.
2. In general, Bitcoins aren't different than anything else with value when it comes to the law.  Some people have the impression that Bitcoin is so completely different that governments are unable to deal with it, but there are plenty of analogues in existing law that can be applied in almost all cases.  Yes, there are a number of unique nuances to Bitcoin that create uncertainty when it comes to the law, but there should be no uncertainty about the general idea that things like tax evasion or ripping people off would cause legal consequences if the impacted parties pursue it.
For example, if you provided someone a good or service in exchange for gold and the other person did not give you the gold then you'd be able to press charges and/or file a civil suit against them - same with Bitcoin.  If you are evading taxes by hiding all of your money offshore or by keeping gold buried in your backyard that you perform all of your transactions with and the government finds out then you'll be charged - same with Bitcoin.

A merchant would have to be ignoring all advice when it comes to accepting Bitcoin for those to have been successful.  Anyone can attempt a doublespend at any time - which is what blockchain.info is tracking there - but a merchant would have to immediately deliver goods without any confirmations of the transaction for those doublespends to be successful.
Some merchants do this if they don't really lose any money in the event of a doublespend, but most merchants wait for at least 1 confirmation.  The greater the value or potential loss in the transaction, the greater number of confirmations that a merchants should be waiting for.

No transactions should be lost because the bug is only with the block size and not with transactions themselves.  The 0.7 clients are seeing the transactions and so they should be incorporated back into the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:04:14
The new address is separate from the old address, so there isn't any way to link them as being from the same wallet *...as long as they aren't linked by future transactions*.  In the bitcoin-qt client you can't select which addresses are used when you send coins somewhere, so it is possible if you're re-using addresses or only sending portions of your wallet holdings to new addresses that there would be addresses that are shared between the new and old transaction that could link them as being from the same wallet.
To remove the possibility of linkage do one of these:
 * Send all BTC in your wallet to a new address and make sure you don't re-use old addresses in the future
 * Use separate wallets
 * Use clients that support selecting which inputs to use (Blockchain.info allows this)
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:17:07
Media attention has been much less negative than I was expecting.  Anyone considering adopting Bitcoin will obviously look at services like Bitpay and see that they don't have to even care about the current exchange rate at all to accept BTC.

The point is to use the offline computer to generate the wallet and secure it (so that there aren't any viruses or whatever else monitoring what you're doing).  Once it is secured, then you should be able to copy that secured wallet to many different locations so that the loss of the file in any 1 place isn't a problem.

I'll let others chime in with their independent analysis, but I will say that we have worked hard to price things competitively.  We have a number of items that are priced lower than anywhere else we can find.  There are also a number of items that we just can't compete with yet, but even in these cases our goal is to set prices within an amount that Bitcoin user will hopefully still decide to purchase with us instead of paying the overhead and dealing with the hassle of converting to their BTC to USD before making a purchase elsewhere.
There are major internet retailers here in the US that are becoming well known for constantly shifting prices huge percentages up and down on a daily basis, so there will be items here and there that might have a larger difference depending upon when you compare.

All change from the blockchain.info wallet goes back to your "main" address - the first address you were provided by them.  So for most newbies everything would probably circulate through the same address and it wouldn't be a problem there.  *Note: This might have changed since I last used it.
blockchain.info also lets you hit 'advanced' and you can control the exact inputs and outputs for all transactions you make as well if you want to ensure that change gets allocated to the address you want.

Your best bet is to keep trying Coinbase periodically.  When you use traditional payment methods like credit cards the vendors pay 2-3%+ which means the products you're purchasing have to be marked up that much.  1% looks like a pretty good deal in comparison.
People are willing to pay the BitInstant fees because it can be more anonymous and the BTC can be received faster.
@_date: 2013-02-27 15:21:57
Simply running away with Bitcoin from outstanding orders would trigger criminal investigations which would likely prevent domestic operations with any kind of size from attempting it.  International, as you say, is a bigger problem.
At Bitcoinin, we take this kind of thing seriously.  We're preemptively looking at getting a surety bond so that, in the event of company collapse for *whatever* reason, customers with outstanding orders would be able to get their Bitcoins back.  We expect that this kind of thing would become more common if there is any kind of high-profile incident of this nature in the future.  Eventually the major Bitcoin payment companies would probably build some sort of insurance into their services as well.
@_date: 2013-03-13 13:39:25
Usually the cash deposit options transfer the USD amount to an exchange.  You then place your order with the exchange so the price is set when you place your buy order at the exchange (or you can set the price you want to pay and hope that the market price goes down to your price point).

Another possible option for those in the US: 
$5 to get the card, but no recurring fees after that and you don't have to make a transaction minimum.  Not FDIC insured, so you don't want to leave money in it.  Looks like you probably need to provide your SSN to register online and get the bank account access, though.
I haven't tested it myself so I do not know for sure if it would work with Coinbase or not.

[We]( haven't noticed any major correlations with the current market activity.

With Blockchain's service, the coins are first sent to a Blockchain-controlled address and then Blockchain forwards it on to you.  If Blockchain's system breaks, the owner decides to stop forwarding the coins and run off with them, or if someone hacks into Blockchain's system then potentially you are screwed.
With the acceptbit setup, the coins are sent directly from the customer to the merchant which completely cuts out a number of these possible avenues for theft.
That said, there are some benefits of Blockchain's service like an API and the optional double spend protection.

1. Other clients use different methods for getting transaction data that don't involve having to download all blocks.
2. This period of fast increase in value in necessary to build a large enough market cap so that there is stability in the future.  Unfortunately that brings some who are only interested in the increase in value, but there are also others who are excited about the increase in value because it is indicator of adoption.
3. Bitcoin has evolved over time and will continue to.

I believe you take the risk currently which is why they let you select how many confirmations you want to wait for.  I don't know how much work they've put into double spend detection, but a few months ago they had said they had never had a double spend.  If you had a one-time incident they might just take the hit if they've already credited your account with an instant payment, but I don't believe they officially guarantee it.
At some point I assume they'll build out their infrastructure to be able to guarantee instant payments, though.  It would probably be a good idea to contact them directly if this is something you'd want.
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:08:03
I don't think this is a problem for the average user because they'd probably have 1 wallet and track their total balance based upon that wallet as a whole - which will be accurate.

Your USD funds sit at the exchange until you convert them to BTC by placing buy orders.  The exchange is a central place for buyers and sellers to exchange USD and BTC.  The exchange makes money by taking a small percent of these trades - they don't make money on whether the BTC price goes up or down.

Bitpay does allow you to split your payment into BTC and USD at whatever percentage you want.
Size of the transaction does impact processing time, but assuming you're shipping a physical good you're probably fine no matter what the size: we're talking a few hours instead of minutes if the person sending the payment doesn't include a transaction fee to get it to you faster.

Anyone who says that they know where the price is going likely has an agenda and it is best to not listen unless you do your own research.  The price has increased rapidly over the past month so maybe it will drop, but there is also a lot of stuff happening in the coming month or two so maybe it will go up.
If you're concerned about sudden drops in the short term you can use dollar cost averaging (buying smaller portions every X days) to even out any spikes in price.  If you're intending on holding for years, though, and believe that BTC is the future then any fluctuations in the short term will probably not make that much of a difference long term.

Speaking specifically about your IP-to-Transaction question:
Transactions are constantly being communicated between nodes so there isn't an easy to way determine where a particular transaction originated* unless, for example, you could monitor all internet traffic and look specifically for the first IP to transmit each transaction.  
To compare with BitTorrent: with BitTorrent the actual file data you're downloading doesn't jump around peer-to-peer - if you're downloading part of the file from a certain IP you know that that IP has a copy of the file.  With Bitcoin the transaction data itself is passed around peer-to-peer so you don't know if the node that just passed you a transaction was the node to originate it or if they're just passing it on from another node.
*speaking specificially about the main Satoshi client - different clients operate in different ways
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:49:57
At the time of the transaction, we capture the current exchange rate for a few tax reasons.  If the item was purchased for 1BTC and the exchange rate is 80 USD, we'd then charge the tax based off of the $80 figure.
When we turn around and either use that 1 BTC to purchase supplies or to exchange it for USD, we would then also use that exchange rate to determine if we owe any capital gains taxes if the value of BTC has gone up.
It isn't too difficult as long as you have a shopping cart and accounting system that can handle multiple currencies.

1. Electrum doesn't "store" your money with the centralized server.  Your private keys are stored on your machine and the centralized servers (which there are many different ones across the globe you can connect to) simply act as a service for updating balances and transmitting transactions to the greater BTC network.

Bitcoinin has received a flood of orders over the past 5 days which has maxed out our small operation's packing and shipping throughput.  We're bringing on a temp to help with the shipping today and we may also start having certain orders dropshipped from our suppliers (though we don't like doing this as then we don't have control over the quality/accuracy).  To compensate for the delays in turnaround we're sending out most orders priority and we're located in the middle of America - Minnesota, so once we ship domestic orders they should arrive within 2 or 3 days - we hope that orders will arrive in the same amount of time as if they had been shipped faster but with a slower service.
We had anticipated the possibility for this which is why we tried to set expectations by listing worst-case shipping estimates during checkout and not offering faster shipping options until we were sure that we could turn around orders consistently.  We completely agree about the deflation trap, though, and we're prepared to continue to ramp up and streamline our operations as necessary if orders continue to come in at the same or greater rate.
So, please don't become disgruntled if it takes a couple of business days to receive the shipping confirmation - our goal is that you'll still receive your products in the same amount of time!

1. There is no guarantee that it will be added as absolutely soon as possible because the transactions are processed by the distributed system.  That said, any fee over the minimum currently will very likely result in your transaction being included in the next block.
2. It is possible to not have a transaction confirmed.

4. Yes, there are a number of different solutions being pursued by different parties.

At any given point there are people willing to buy at certain prices (bids) and people willing to sell at certain prices (ask). The gap between the 2 is called the spread.  During periods of lower volume - particularly when there are just bots making tiny trades - the current price will jump back and forth across the spread as the low volume isn't enough to move the market significantly.

1. Realize that there are very few coins exchanged at the bottom of a flash crash
2. Realize that you probably aren't going to be able to pick the bottom (just like picking the top is difficult) - anyone with an order under $36 got 0 coins.
Your best bet to capitalize on events like this (without getting completely into daytrading, building bots, dealing with trade lag) is to simply keep a small amount of fiat at an exchange with some buy orders at different intervals.  Update the buy orders periodically as the price changes.  If, for example, you had small orders at $4 intervals when this flash crash happened you could have easily picked up some coins at $45, $41, $37 as the price went down.

There is a reason why Bitcointalk has a stickied post titled "Trust No One" for Newbies - though obviously it is titled in such stark terms to make a point.  With traditional online payment methods the buyer has to prove themselves by providing a bunch of info and having that info vetted against anti-fraud systems.

If all transactions were accepted by miners at the same rate then attackers could simply bounce coins around to waste miner's bandwidth and disk space.
The other motivator is ensuring that mining is sustainable so that the network is secure: As the static block reward that miners get decreases over time, miners will need to pay their electric bills with the fees included in transactions.  If there wasn't some incentive for people to include fees in their transactions then no one would pay the fee, fewer folks could afford to mine, and the network would become more vulnerable to attack.

It is true that the wallet only stores addresses, but it isn't true that you don't have to back it up more than once (assuming we're talking about the main bitcoin-qt client).  You need to back it up *at least* every 100 transactions: the client pre-generates 100 addresses and will keep 100 "extras".  If you perform more than 100 transactions since you backed it up, you won't have the 101th address and you could lose any BTC that were sent to those addresses.

The best way to tell who sends funds is to provide a different address to each person/account.

Yes, your scenario is possible and it has been known to be possible in the case of a forked blockchain.  Any merchant taking some sort of irreversible action based upon a limited number of blockchain confirmations needs to be aware of it and build in ways to protect themselves because these kinds of scenarios were going to happen sooner or later.  Merchants have probably not been made aware of the possibilities as much as they should have been, though, so it is good that this happened now as an accident rather than in the future during a real, coordinated attack on the network.

If you're hosting a site over tor you're probably going to be a target for hacking, so you probably wouldn't want to run your normal wallet software on the same machine if you didn't have to.  Using a website service is an easy way to check transactions/addresses without having to risk having funds taken.
If you're hosting a site over tor you're probably also concerned about privacy.  Accessing blockchain's site/services from your server can cause some information about what you're doing to be exposed to different parties depending upon how you do it and the more securely you attempt to set things up, the more unreliable it would likely become.  Using this service could reduce the possible avenues for information exposure depending upon what you're trying to protect from and would theoretically be much more reliable.

There really isn't any downside from a risk perspective if you don't want there to be - and implementation can be extremely easy so there can be very little cost involved.
It seems like you're approaching Bitcoin in an appropriate way already, but do understand that the Bitcoin community is still small and that you probably aren't going to be getting huge flood of Bitcoin orders at first.  Some amount of belief is required that Bitcoin isn't some sort of passing fad and that users+businesses will continue to snowball.  If getting as far away from PayPal as possible is your goal, though, you probably already have the underlying understanding of why there is such huge potential here - and by being apart of it you're helping that growth take place.

1. I'm not sure about the backup space, but some of this generally is because many Bitcoin businesses are startups or smaller companies who see the amazing opportunities in Bitcoin and are building services from scratch to fill the void so they have higher costs/overhead than an established business.
2. If you're concerned about the risks, most of them can be mostly or completely removed by using one of the merchant services.  You can still keep your USD pricing behind the scenes, but have the Bitcoin users pay a varying amount based upon the current exchange rate.  If you are afraid of exchange rates you can then have it automatically pay you that USD equivalent.
3. Obviously any additional security features are appreciated by this crowd, but probably not necessary because this crowd would probably be encrypting all the data they back up before they send it to you anyway.  Asking for address isn't a complete deal-breaker, but when a new Bitcoin-accepting business asks me for info they don't need anymore for a Bitcoin transaction it makes me feel like they didn't really put much effort into embracing Bitcoin.  If there is a reason you're asking for it, though, state the reason.
4. If you're based in the US, Coinbase and BitPay are your best bets to get started.

Network splits could possibly be detected via noticeable drops in block creation.  The smaller side of the split should be able to notice a significant decrease in hash power and corresponding block creation - which could be used to trigger failsafes.  The missing hashes won't be as noticeable for the larger side of the split, but it also doesn't matter as much because they'll probably have the longer chain.

No transactions should be lost.  The bug isn't with the different versions seeing different transactions - it was only with one version not accepting certain sized blocks.  Since both versions see the same transactions they should all still be included.

It appears to be a service purely for website developers who host sites on torhost to check on Bitcoin addresses.  
For example, if you wanted to host a store over tor that accepted Bitcoin, you could use their service to quickly check whether payments were sent or not.
Itself it doesn't really harden the Bitcoin network, but would make it easier for developers to make more Bitcoin tools available on tor.

It depends on how quickly the 0.8 miners switch to 0.7.  It appears there is about 11 blocks of difference which would take 110 minutes to mine normally.  Miners are split now, though, so it will take longer than that.

Yes, the privacy concerns are valid: there are trade-offs with all of the different approaches.

We thought it made sense as well.  Strangely there really haven't been many orders of those products compared to the other product categories.  We only started stocking a few adult items just to see what kind of demand there was, though, so perhaps there isn't enough selection.  We're considering spinning off a separate adult store with a much more robust selection of those products.

What is your tolerance for risk?  You should probably only invest only what you are comfortable losing.
How would you feel if the day after you put all of your money into BTC the price dropped by 25%?  50%?  100%?  Do you believe in Bitcoin enough to not worry yourself sick whether the price will rebound?  If it didn't or didn't for some time, would you be able to pay your bills?  These are the kinds of questions you should ask yourself and only invest what you're comfortable with.  There are more robust investing questionnaires out there to gauge your risk tolerance which you might want to explore.

Short answer: no.
Long answer: Mining is taking the information about the previous block of transactions, adding data about transactions currently taking place on the network, and then racing to solve a computational problem that uses that data.  New blocks are generated on average every 10 minutes, so you'd have to be running back and forth between an internet-connected machine and your mining machine constantly.  Then, if you were able to solve a block, every second it took you to get the data back to the internet machine would be seconds that the rest of the miners in the world would have to beat you.

We're glad you're happy with your purchase!
@_date: 2013-03-04 18:31:02
Yes, it is easy profit.  The problem usually is keeping accounts funded in the exchanges where the price is low - once you've made a purchase at a low price, transferred the BTC, and taken your profit from the "high" exchange you then either have to wait for the exchanges to swap places price-wise or wait for bank transfers to get the correct accounts funded again.

If they are pursued further, blacklists would be entirely voluntary because there is no way you'd be able to get a majority of users to agree to some sort of central blacklist authority.  Those pursuing the idea have a variety of different motivations, but the impact on completely innocent users is way too high for it to ever be something mandatory.

I do hope that BitcoinStore is able to either come through with the orders they need, are able to negotiate the continuation of the contract, or are at least able to successfully spin missing the goal as still being a success for the tiny BTC economy.  
The publicizing of 0% markup has brought some great press.  As they have also put such a focus on the sales goal, though, I am afraid of what followup press might look like if they don't hit it.

My guess (just a guess) is that casascius funds the addresses when purchased as a final test to ensure that the address was printed correctly and/or a way to keep track of which bars have been purchased.
I wouldn't be too concerned as long as there are only incoming transactions.  Casascius releases all of the the addresses (  ), so it is also possible that someone else sent you some change.

Indeed.  There are also a number of folks who convert their fiat to BTC just to support the greater Bitcoin economy: if you're holding a certain amount of BTC and are looking to buy a book then you can buy extra BTC and purchase the book within the BTC economy which then helps assure that the amount you're saving increases in value.

There is going to be an evolution of the distributed-ness of Bitcoin.  It started with Satoshi who had complete control to develop and fix bugs.  Then, there was 1 other miner who had to roll out new versions with him.  Then, a handful of miners.  Over time we should hopefully continue to become more distributed - with different clients, with more developers and testing, etc.
Bitcoin is completely open source.  If governments/banks wanted to insert bad code via a developer into Bitcoin then they could try but there are 100s of other developers who are looking at every change, many miners refuse to update their code until a lot of time has passed, etc.  And this risk isn't only something Bitcoin has to deal with - there are 1000s of open source projects that deal with the same thing.
The reason why it seems like the devs had a lot of control last night is because there was an easy solution that everyone (devs and miners) could easily agree on and the solution they decided on was the most conservative option (having miners move back to the known version instead of having everyone move up to a less known version).  Had there been a more controversial or risky solution pushed then you would have seen the democracy of Bitcoin at work: developers and miners would have been "voting" for the solution they thought was best.
There are more complete answers to all of these out there.  Yes, most people who are investing know the risks - which is why you keep seeing "don't invest more than you can afford to lose".  
TL;DR: The incident last night reinforced many people's belief in the robustness of Bitcoin instead of exposing unknown risks.

Always keep secured backups of everything you do - even if you think a wallet is only temporary or no longer contains any funds.  For example, if you have some private keys for cold storage and want to use some of the funds by importing the keys into another wallet, create the wallet and back it up BEFORE importing and sending.  This protects you against very poorly timed machine crashes, losing things like the private keys to change addresses, or having mistyped/misremembered passwords.

We ([Bitcoinin]( accept BTC directly.  For sales tax, we charge the sales tax percent that applies for the customer as BTC at the current currency rate and pass it on to the state as USD.
Currently, we have calculated an amount of BTC that we'd be fine holding even if the value went to 0 for an extended period of time.  We keep that amount in BTC to pay for the supplies we can purchase in BTC and the rest we convert to USD to pay the other suppliers.
Our hope is to eventually be able to pay all of our suppliers in BTC, but haven't convinced them yet.  As this happens and as the volatility declines, we'll hold more in BTC and have to convert less.
If you can't handle the stress involved with volatility then I'd certainly recommend going with one of the Bitcoin merchant services.  If you are open to calculating your risk then accepting coins directly removes the middleman (removing fees, dependency on the service's systems, etc)

We aren't big yet, but we have big plans and have been pondering these kinds of questions since we're in the middle of building our "real" site off of the proof of concept, minimally-viable current version we created to test the market.
A) The main threat vector for employee fraud in our case is via customer service employees.  To prevent this, we're adding a queuing/approval process into our system so that transactions can be reviewed and approved manually without having to allow direct access to private keys.  We have an eye towards eventually releasing parts of our system as open source as we think that there could be a lot of businesses that could benefit.
B) This won't apply to us as much as other businesses because we generally have hours to ensure payment confirmation before handing the product over to ship.  In the event it does become an issue, though, it shouldn't be a problem to simply request that customers add appropriate transaction fees to their payment if they need expedited handling.
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:07:46
This is an excellent use of BTC as well: being able to pay someone without having to worry about exactly where they're located, what currency they normally use, having to collecting bank account info, etc. 
Bitcoin could eventually become the reserve currency for businesses: holding BTC until they need to make payments out to their suppliers or employees - which they can do with 0 fee. 
Huge news.

Bitcoinin would offer to stock and resell some of the bags for you to get you started, but frankly as long as you don't have a problem dealing with the customer service/shipping, maintaining your bitmit/BitMarket posts, and eventually building your customized upload site, then you're probably better off doing it yourself though those channels.  The beauty of Bitcoin is that there is much less of a need for middlemen because there is so little overhead required in accepting payments.
If there are any specific products you need in exchange for BTC, let us know - we have access to a lot more products than we offer on our site and we're constantly adding more - many by request.  I'm not sure about the ink-setting chemicals but we could most certainly source the inkjet printer and possibly the fabric if you had specific models/brands.
As far as taxes go, ecommerce vendors only have to charge tax in states where they have a "nexus" - which will probably only be the state you live in.  If you have a sale within the state then you'll want to collect the sales tax from them and register with your state so that you can pass it on (if your state has a sales tax).  Keep track of your sales, the corresponding BTC exchange rate at the time of the sale, and all of your expenses (supplies, boxes, shipping, etc) so that you can calculate your income as well as your gains/losses from the BTC exchange rate.
Best of luck!

We started  in November.  We thought that it'd take us a year or more before we needed to start planning for expansion, but we were wrong.  We thought that orders would come in at irregular rates during periods of volatile exchange rate fluctuations and be hard to plan for, but we were wrong.  We're finding that the market is larger than we had initially estimated and customers are using Bitcoin no matter what the exchange rate is for a variety of different reasons.
Yes, the Bitcoin community is still small right now, we're just a startup, and our experience might not match up with yours as I don't know what you're selling, but if you're getting requests to accept Bitcoin then you are probably selling something that the current Bitcoin demographic wants.

Yes, it is possible for a transaction to never confirm but it is rare.  Standard clients continue to broadcast their unconfirmed transactions periodically until they are confirmed which usually guarantees that the transaction is eventually accepted by a miner.
There is no guarantee in the protocol, though - what gets confirmed is entirely up to the miners who are creating blocks (maintaining the transaction ledger).  The more "spammy", complicated, and small (in the amount transacted) your transaction is, the more likely miners will pass it up when they see it and the longer it will take to confirm.

Major online retailers are able to play games with constantly shifting prices and they're able to take tiny or negative profits from things like new releases in order to bring in new customers who start assuming they'll always be getting the best deal.
Eventually we hope to be able to do a better job of tracking the competition's prices, but we currently don't have that kind of backend system yet.  The more support and volume we get, though, obviously the faster we can start matching - and then beating - what they're doing.

This is why all of the alerts included the warning to merchants to stop relying on confirmations temporarily.  Merchants like this probably need to build something into their systems to automatically go into a safe mode if a 2-3 block fork is detected - which is something that is also needed if/when the network is under actual attack.
...and the devs and/or market will likely come up with more solutions now that we have a real example to point to instead of it just being a known potential issue.

Valve is a much smaller company whose target market and method of delivery would be much more in line with accepting BTC.  They've remained trailblazers even as they've grown (expanding to Linux for example), so they'd be much more likely to start accept it.
