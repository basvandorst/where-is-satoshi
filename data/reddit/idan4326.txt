Purchasing power vs the dollar 
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:38:30
Does it means that the real gains are only 10% due to the 15% lose in purchasing power?
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:26:38
“Currency is stable store of value” says the notorious   “man who broke the bank of england “ haha like the venezuela boulevard or maybe the zimbabwe dollar
What about the US dollar? Nope not so stable either 
We are tired from these governments Ponzi scheme robing us from our wealth together with people like this time to change this corrupted system
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:00:47
Gained more than 1000% so I don’t worry whatsoever 
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:17:53
I understand that but due to decades of factories moving to China India etc from the US most of the consumer goods are manufactured overseas no? I am trying to get a sense of how bad the weaker dollar might effect the average American consumer 
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:30:28
Well it’s the biggest economy in the world it has to be in the news but  i am glad at least some of our wealth is not in the reach of any government easily thanks to bitcoin so they can keep with their games 
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:21:41
Hmm i see so it’s looks like both parties will keep passing the ball to each other and will devalue their currencies to oblivion if they have to in order to keep their economies afloat
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:44:28
Correct me if i am wrong but It’s a bad thing for savers in $ they lose purchasing power of their wealth and since the US import a lot of the goods from abroad any imported goods could see “price increase”
(Its actually the dollars losing purchasing power)

Hold fiat to pay my bills and have all of my savings in gold silver and crypto

It’s still much better than credit card. If someone used a fake or stolen card the owner can cancel the transaction weeks or months after it was made.
with cash you can get paid with fake bills and suffer the lose  or transfer it to someone else illegally and immorally.
With bitcoin you know that with each confirmation the chances for a double spend get smaller to practically impossible . It’s not a perfect system none are
but it works good enough and will get better.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:32:05
If he wants he can use platform like valutoro to buy gold with bitcoin in order to offset the high moves.

Near 0 interest rates. Qe programs(aka printing money)
Thirst for yields, the end of the petro-dollar system,bubbles everywhere, increasing gap between rich and poor.
...and revolutionary tech that challenge the hundreds years old banking system.hell of a mix.
Bitcoin doesn’t work in a vacuum.it’s a unique set of events 
together and no one knows where it will go from here.
but correction is not a bubble. when a bubble burst in never reaches the same highs again. Maybe we are due to a correction and maybe not but i think we have seen nothing yet in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:57:20
When a bubble burst in never reaches the same highs again. 
so far bitcoin was called a bubble in 1$ 10$ 100$ 1000$ and a shocker at 10000$. 
All of that before it’s even widely used by the entire population.
So maybe it’s not a bubble?  maybe it’s really a disruptive technology that will change banking?
It might fail or might succeed but it’s not comparable to the tulip mania in my view.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:24:41
They are trying to pin down the blame for the crash on bitcoin so the public won’t blame them

Can some one put jaime diamond face on the face of the bull.
and Bitcoin on the goose.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:22:45
The transactions happen instantly or near it
but the confirmation time is dictated  by the block creation time which is 10min on avg and the time it took for the transaction to enter the block which depends on the fee you paid.
Bitcoins are mined when a miner mine a block that was accepted as the block that will be included next on the blockchain and as i said that’s happening every 10min on avg.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:41:10
Because that’s not the right solution to the problem
will only solve it temporarily and will make the network less decentralized and less secure.
It was already linked here few times i think but one more time won’t hurt.

I will keep using fiat currency to pay my bills 
and will keep my savings in gold silver and bitcoin. 
As i see fiat the inferior medium of exchange and therefore i will dump(use) it when i need something up until the day it is gone. I have no doubt this day is coming.

When roger ver says “my project” (referring to bcash in rage when his coin was called bcash).
that’s all you need to know in my opinion about where not to put your wealth and trust. We already have central banks we don’t need a central crypto too.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:16:42
That’s one form of bitcoin mining lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:45:28
I am reading mastering bitcoin it supposed to be more technical but I can’t give you my personal opinion because i am just starting it. Worth looking into it tho see if it’s what you are looking for.

I see they haven’t learned from their past and that killing innovation only hurts you.

Even if banks will remain they will have a different role in the system. Right now they issue currency through debt
and fractional reserve banking which mean each currency unit created has an interest attached to it.
and the money in your account is an iou of the bank to you
which means it’s not really there. it’s an obligation to pay you when you need it but they can default on their obligations. 
If you hold the private key to BTC you are the owner.
The currency unit is produced by actual work(computer calculations and electricity),
and has no interest attached to it when it’s been created.
Now why will i want to hold my wealth in a bank that is open when it wants ,close when it wants and decide what to do with my wealth as it wishes. or in other words
put my trust in an untrustworthy 3rd party?.
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:18:26
If you have 20k in fiat well sure you will always have 20k in said fiat the real question is how much stuff  will you be able to buy next year next decade etc...lets not forget that at the beginning of 2017 BTC was 1k so yoy its still up.

With micro payments bitcoin is also WaterBear bad ass creatures 
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:52:45
Other than the complete halt of the network without it coming back online I honestly don’t see bitcoin dropping to 0 ever. It can become irrelevant with a lower value if development on it stopped.and the eco system (hodlers/merchant/customers) stopped growing as well. But even then it will have some value and will never die completely. I believe that in that case it will be replaced by another system because this pandora box is already open and the broken debt based fiat system can’t make it go away.
I honestly believe that we have a bigger chance seen major fiat currencies dropping to 0 (well in terms of purchasing power due to hyperinflation) in the coming decade.

I am from Israel the “IRS” here looks on crypto as a stock (I disagree but they managed to win a case  in court I hope it will change in the future)so you have to pay 25% on profits in their view they want people to be able to sell and transfer the funds into the banks because the state earn income so I assume it will be resolved one way or the other...
Even if it won’t it will not be a killing blow to Bitcoin please read about “the red flag act” in the UK it didn’t kill the car it just made UK lose progress which moved elsewhere the same thing will happen here if they will not resolve their bureaucracy here or anywhere else.

He is not a regular investor or user he is a bch leader that tries to take over the bitcoin brand
And as such he can’t talk on both sides of his mouth 
Without raising red flags in my view. Ofc i can’t tell him what to do with his money but if he truly believes that bch is the one and only bitcoin it would be more effective
 to see it in actions.
Otherwise i think that  he has some doubt or malicious plans for btc.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:08:57
If some government ban bitcoin they will lose all the innovation in their country and everything will go either black market or else where. Like aantonop said in his lectures the red flag act in United Kingdom didn’t kill the auto mobile world wide but it sure as hell ruined the innovation in the United kingdom. Same goes for the electricity, internet etc. you can’t close this pandora box.
Either accept it and see how you adapt to it or fight it and admit defeat later.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:46:45

If you want to hoard the coins rather than spend them, than you can bet that a seller of goods and services also wants to hoard them too. Plus they want to sell you goods and services.
So they can lower the price of their goods right to the sweet spot that makes your spending will greater than the hoarding will. We are not used to this concept because we live in a debt system that is killing our savings and forces us to spend all the time creating more debt or everything collapses . With sound deflationary money you will think twice if you really need the product because of the incentive of wealth gains if you are not spending. It’s much better for us and for the planet because we are wasting lots of resources and we can’t consume for infinity in a finite world.

If they are so smart they should short bitcoin and put money where their mouths are plus lets have a prospective it’s still higher that it was at the beginning of 2017 lets look on it yoy and not on a weekly time line to know if it was a good year or not.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:46:58
Why not? :) people sitting on side lines screaming bubble bubble are irrelevant in my view it’s you vs yourself if you believe in the tech and the amount of innovation that it is creating and the upcoming development and progress than the short term price is irrelevant as well
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:09:03
Why do you have to throw 10k on btc? You can buy in any amount you want you don’t have to own 1 bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-07-27 03:11:46
Sure thing but the good thing about deflationary money is that it holds its value so even small amount of savings hold your purchasing power or even gain some if you have a low time preference (meaning hold back some spending in the present in order to buy more in the future)
