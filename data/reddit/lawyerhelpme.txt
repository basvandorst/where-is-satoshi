Local DA aggress with the fact that "The burden is on the Government to establish that the property is subject to forfeiture by a "preponderance of the evidence.".... we provided prof that the money was legally obantable by sell recites...they investigated the sender and found that he has no connection to any drug organization or crime... this is now offered to the local federal office to see if they have any reason to take funds ...same rules appy and it  requires a lot of  paper work ...

They didn't give a shit about the seller... and the seller was located in the "suspicious area" Box never made it past the sorting center  .... its about making money and i think bitcoin is gonna be the next think they can take cash from...
" And in civil forfeiture cases, like that of Caswell, the owner of the property’s guilt is not the issue debated—if the property was used for crimes, it can be seized. The Justice Department’s asset forfeiture fund was at $1.8 billion in 2011, and it gave away nearly half a billion dollars to local police departments."

Ny has the hardest and most active enforcement of money laundering laws ( and most out of date.... Like pre floppy disk) ....Even thought bitcoin is federally legal many states are taking cash and BTC calming that you must prove the funds didn't come from Crime...Many are being told to wait as within the next few years NY is updating there regulation and structure of BTC as  payment even thought its legally a commodity. Look up Bitcoin business in google ... plenty of articles scarring the crap out of anyone taking bitcoin as payment :(
