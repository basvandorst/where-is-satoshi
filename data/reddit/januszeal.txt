Alright, but the PCI-e bus speed doesn't matter when mining. A 7950 mines at ~650 mhash/sec regardless of if it's connected to a 16x or 1x slot.

I know Coinbase locks the market price in at the time you purchase the BTC, and this won't work when you've previously scheduled a transaction. My theory until I hear back from them is that they charge a % above market when they initiate the transaction, then refund part of it. That hasn't happened yet though, so we'll see.
