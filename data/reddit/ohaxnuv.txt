History repeats itself. Prepare for launch.

Stop worrying. Bitcoin has two words: Brand Recognition.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:12:22
Yes ^^^
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:03:09
Thanks! Seems obvious now

If you are only here for the USD gains then that is a paradox. Think about it... bitcoin only raises in value if people think it has worth. If you are looking to cash out to USD then you think that bitcoin has no worth. Therefore, why would you buy bitcoin and expect gains in the first place if you think it has no worth. Paradox.

Hit the nail on the head.

Already 14

I can prove it if you want
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:28:01
Don't take out a loan for speculative investments.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:56:09
Proving it anyways, feel free to connect or send me a message. I really want to get involved with the community
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:16:49
How will loans work if Bitcoin goes mainstream and no banks exist?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:59:51
Still new to this. I'll have to figure out how to do that. Just trying to warn other newbs to prevent them from making my mistake. Thanks for the tip!

Just wait it out. Bitcoin will win because of 2 words: Brand Recognition
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:08:19
Why do people care about gains and cashing out? The whole point is to hold bitcoin until you can use bitcoin to buy the stuff you want. If you are looking to cash out why are you even here?

Hmm strange I just assumed it meant hold on for dear life
