It wasn't a bad deal. It became the first \(documented\) purchase and paved the way for future adoption. and if you want bitcoin to buy more you should pay attention on Socratus,  that was created in order to make the communication between customer and insurance company more convenient and simple. With this ecosystem, companies will be able to cut operating costs, create new insurance products, deal with data analysis more efficiently and many other benefits. Right now, it is on the stage of private token pre\-sales. And I think that it is rеally worth investing in.
