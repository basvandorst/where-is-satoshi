I seriously do not understand what you're trying to say here
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:50:33
well I guess that would be true if we could rely on the transactions remaining low, but given the nature of the market-based fees, when the demand goes up the fees will rise.  
However, as lightning network establishes itself, by adding a second layer on top of the existing blockchain it will reduce the demand on the main blockchain and in the best case scenario this will help stabilize the fees.
This isn't an all or nothing situation -- lightning network is simply an added feature that will demonstrate its usefulness over time, especially in times of high fees.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:38:32
yea, I would generally agree with this.
Right now everyone is trying to come up with some explanation as to why we are in a bear market.  Newsflash:  that incredible bull run put is in to overvalued territory, and this is simply a correction.  No further explanation required.
This has happened several times to bitcoin and this is one more time.  And it will probably go through more bull run hype cycles followed by bear run corrections 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:00:47
As if this government agency is somehow an authority over the consensus of the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:14:31
This makes no sense.  Segwit makes the Lightning network better
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:11:31
The point is that right now fees are low because some of the hype has died down.  This makes the current moment a good opportunity to move to segwit, so that in the future if fees go up again during another busy season (and they probably will) then you will have already put your money into a segwit address, thereby insulating yourself better against potential high fees in the future.

Good shit from a wise dude.
Side note:  I absolutely hate how in all of these news articles and videos bitcoins are shown to be some kind of physical, tangible gold-colored coin with a ₿ etched into it.
So many people are going to be taught that "Bitcoins" are physical coins which simply doesn't make any sense

I don't care about Assange's predicament.

Cryptocurrency takes that barrier away, that is all.

Nice deflection.  
I wasn't talking about the DNC, I was talking about the actions of Assange.  DNC has their own corruption issues, but that is not the topic of this discussion.
Assange acted as a convenient puppet to the agencies that fed Wikileaks information (hint:  it was Russia)

@_date: 2017-12-15 16:07:09
Well let's see
Russia hacked the DNC, and strategically fed the hacked information to Wikileaks.  Wikileaks / Assange could have chosen to be more neutral, but instead they either willfully released the information at Russia's convenience, or they foolishly got manipulated by Russia.
Either way, the actions of Wikileaks were detrimental to the democratic election of the United States, to the benefit of Russia, and for whichever reason it was, Julian Assange is complicit in this series of events

There is a company that is doing basically what you described.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:42:40
Doesn't matter.  The point of cryptocurrencies is that banks can no longer be the gatekeepers of access to financial services.  Want to send $1000 across the world?  No permission required.
Are you a political target like wikileaks?  No permission required to transfer money.
What happens if your country devolves into a despotic state and anyone who is X is no longer given the same civil rights as everyone else, and the governments enacts legislation to force banks to refuse services to X people.  That has happened before and it will be tried again but cryptocurrency breaks those barriers

And that's because he is a major asset.  He is representative of the best part of this community.  This is also, not coincidentally, why Andreas is a threat to the people over at rBTC and this is why if you read the comments over there lately regarding Andreas all you will find is them shitting on him.  So be it, their loss

Other than the tweet?  nothing.  But ever since Segwit2X and then now BCH, Roger has found himself on the opposing side of everyone who supports the original Bitcoin, and this includes Andreas Antonopolous.  Since Roger Ver is pushing a very specific agenda with the end goal of making BCH number one, anyone who is in the way of that goal is a threat to him.  This includes Andreas, and because of this Andreas is a threat to him and BCH.  So as the end result, Ver is saying this shit to try and discredit Andreas

I think you missed my point.  Banks can do whatever they want with bitcoin, but bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will remain uncontrolled and decentralized.  If banks make a bunch of money trading different crypto-related products then good for them,  who cares?  The underlying technology still breaks down the financial barriers that banks have always had a monopoly over

In this discussion, I don't give a shit who won the election or why.  Regardless of which actions led to which outcomes, Assange's participated in Russia's attempt to meddle in the election.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:36:25

@_date: 2017-12-14 17:38:05
Ok but that is besides the point.  It doesn't matter for what reason, be it miners or blocksize or spam or anything else that explains why.  
The fact of the matter is, in its current state, Bitcoin is incapable of being an effective currency for small transactions, which is something that it used to be able to do.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:28:32

That may be the case.  I am not making an argument about the way it should or should not be, I am simply stating the fact that bitcoin in its current form is ineffective as a form of payment for small transactions.  Disclaimer:  I like Bitcoin.  But I want to see some improvements.  I agree 100% that decentralization is a fundamental necessity and I would not want to sacrifice it for some small gain, which is essentially what Bitcoin Cash has done.  But at this particular moment in time, if I wanted to send somebody a small payment worth about $5, I would not use Bitcoin.  I also wouldn't use Bitcoin Cash.  I would use Litecoin
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:24:26
Not OP, but I see it being generally good for Bitcoin.  Why?  Simply the fact that such an instrument of futures trading has been introduced for Bitcoin shows that there is tons of big money interested in it, whether it be because they think it will increase or decrease in value.  I certainly predict that lot's of this big money will short it (put money on a bet that predicts the price will decrease over time) which will scare some investors, but I also predict the opposite is true.  However, regardless of these futures speculators, Bitcoin will continue to be Bitcoin -- an international currency that is being used all around the globe.  So tons of big American money will enter the scene to try and wrestle with this asset, but this asset is too well decentralized and adopted around the globe for the futures to harm bitcoin.

I don't think that is the issue.  OP probably doesn't care whether or not his gum purchase transaction is recorded on the ledger for all eternity, what he cares about is being able to buy the gum.  Right now, Bitcoin is not usable as a currency for small transactions for things such as a pack of gum.

Bitcoin is bigger and better than the current fee situation right now.  This is a growing pain, and a valid point of criticism, but it is also valid to realize that it is temporary and unsustainable.  If Bitcoin can't fix the scalability problem then it will die, but it isn't as if developers are not working tirelessly on new **long-term** solutions to fix this problem, instead of just slapping some band-aid approach of increasing the block size
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:43:24
Well that may be the case.  But then the point stands that Bitcoin is ineffective at being a currency for small transactions.  Does that make it worthless?  No, I wouldn't say so.  But it is a deficiency that Bitcoin currently has and I think it is important to recognize this

@_date: 2018-05-15 18:45:02
Unpleasant news?  More like pure propaganda.  I am all for hearing any truthful "unpleasant" news, regardless of which nation it is about.  But it is important to keep in mind that Russia spends a considerable amount of resources spreading propaganda on the internet and one of the best ways we can innoculate ourselves from it is to avoid any disreputable sources, for example RT.  RT is completely untrustworthy, even if they *sometimes* report the truth

Of course we can all see that there is definitely a bias in this piece and that the objective is to devalue bitcoin by pointing out how useless it is.  The way I see it, if anybody chooses to read this and believe what the author says, then they will be doing themselves a disservice.  People like this author can piss and moan all they want about the fact that bitcoin is disrupting the status quo, but the rest of the world does not give a fuck.  If bitcoin is a technology that can solve a problem that millions of people (or billions) can benefit from, then anybody can say or cry about any flaw they want about instability or "cracked codes" (lol) but its usage will only continue to grow and that means that the value will only go up.  For those people who steadfastly refuse to participate in bitcoins, it will be an embarrassing reality check when the price sees great gains

Agreed.  We definitely need to foster a culture of open conversation.  However I have a question:  Let's say you have this great community filled with open discussion, but then it starts to get brigaded by trolls and bots in the way that operates.  How does the open community protect themselves from misinformation campaigns?  
It is becoming obvious that it is fairly easy for powerful groups to push any message they want with troll / bot farms to just spew any absolute garbage information and you can have thousands of accounts parroting these lies / untruths / alternative facts / FUD / misinformation.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:49:05
You are correct in that BTC right now is suffering a scaling problem that makes it ineffective for sending small amounts of value in many cases.  But solutions are being implemented but good solutions take time.  If you use a good wallet you can push throw very low fee transactions
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:16:21
Well eventually 8MB would become the new 1MB.  Everyone would be crying that 8MB is not large enough in the same way that they are crying that 1MB is not large enough.  So then 8MB becomes 64MB, so on and so forth.  It is an unsustainable solution and only temporarily relieves the network but as the OP said, it is not a viable long term solution

[Futures are a financial instrument]( which allow speculative investors to put their money into their prediction that the price of the asset will either go up or it will go down.  
The reason why Bitcoin futures are significant is because these financial instruments will open the door to regular investors without them having to touch any of this confusing cryptocurrency thingymajig themselves.  
In short, it means that this opens up a door to a ton of new money about to enter the bitcoin market.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:56:01

Why do I care?  Because saying "Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin" is factually false.  It is a forked chain that now has it's own network, and is only successful because it has the name bitcoin in it, but it is not bitcoin.  Bitcoin refers to the OG cryptocurrency BTC, and all of the hype and all of the value in the entire cryptocurrency sphere stems from the invention of bitcoin.  Then some self-interested conmen come along and try to hijack the original invention claiming that what they have is better.  
An argument could be made that it is better, but that is besides the point.  Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin.  Just like Bitcoin Gold is not Bitcoin.  Just like Bitcoin Segwit2x is not Bitcoin.  These are all attempts to get onto the Bitcoin hype train and try to drive it themselves.

"logically it makes 0 sense" only if you define the situation in that way.
When you look at it from the position that Roger Ver and his other crooked buddies and also Jihan want to "destroy" BTC and also puppet that "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" then you start to see all of these little tricks that a charlatan would try in order to achieve that objective.

I think you are very wrong on this one.  Bitcoin (BTC) is a great crypto but it is not the be-all end-all.  In one way this is kind of like the invention of electricity, and there was a [competition between different implementations]( except in this case instead of 2 main choices (AC versus DC) there are 1000+ cryptos, each with their own implementation of crypto technology.  If Bitcoin fails, the other 1000 currencies aren't just going to disappear, in fact they will fill any void that Bitcoin leaves open

Yea, it is an unsustainable band-aid fix.  It will work for now, and right now there is alot of excitement and maybe its a pump-and-dump.  But if Bitcoin Cash gains any kind of real traction and people start using it, then some time in the future it is inevitable that they will hit a wall like BTC is hitting right now with 1MB.  It will just be a wall on a larger scale and it will incentivize centralization which could break it in the long run.  
I can see that BCH might see some impressive gains in the next few years like BTC has, but I think it is choosing the easy, dangerous, fragile path

My guess is that if there is lots of speculative money (in the form of futures) that is guessing that Bitcoin price will go up, then this would probably give confidence to the market and make it more bullish, or vice versa - if lot's of money says the price is going to go down, it may scare many buyers and cause people to pull out.

He's probably not referring to BCH but one of the 1000+ other cryptos out there.  Bitcoin has first-mover advantage in this *very* new technology, but if Bitcoin faces an attack that it cannot survive, some other crypto will fill the void, be it BCH (unlikely) or any other alt.  IMO, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Monero are all great coins, and if Bitcoin was to crumble today, all three of those would surge in and fill the void.

The only thing I believe in that is relevant to the bitcoin story is that there is one true great invention which is Bitcoin, and that a bunch of self-interested charlatans will always try to harness some of that greatness and claim it for themselves, but the true thing that makes bitcoin explicitly valuable is that it is decentralized, and to try and claim it would destroy it.  It cannot be claimed
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:25:32
The only difference between the two is that BCH has 8mb blocks which is a band-aid solution to a problem that cannot be fixed by simply increasing the block size.  Increasing the block size *does* allow more transactions per second, *for now*.  It does solve, for a short period of time, the scaling problem.  Until 8MB is no longer enough and then the exact same problem will return.  The scaling problem cannot be solved by simply increasing block sizes, and BCH might see some success in the future, but BTC is where the party is.
You can cry "whitepaper" all you want, but BTC is bitcoin.  BCH is Bitcoin Cash, an alt-coin push by Roger Ver, a guy who has zero credibility left in this sphere.

Then why not just use a credit card instead of cryptocurrency?  That is a much simpler system, technologically speaking.  The fact is, bitcoin is an incredibly complex technology with no simple answers to large problems like scaling.  BCH might be feeling pretty good right now, but it is an unsustainable solution to the very complex problem

What purpose does BCH serve that any other coin doesn't already do better?  The only thing that sets it apart from other coins is that it has the word Bitcoin in the name, which is great for confusing new investors.

"It's in the name!"
No it's not.  BTC is Bitcoin.  BTC adopted segwit, and segwit is one of the features of BTC.  'BTC SegWit' is an incorrect and redundant name that nobody would use unless they were specifically distinguishing it from Segwit2x.  Even then, it is still incorrect because you can just say Bitcoin and you would be referring to BTC and not the Segwit2X alt coin.  There is one original bitcoin that has the name bitcoin, and it uses the ticker BTC.

And don't invest in more than you can afford to lose.  
As an example: 
 if losing $20,000 will break you and you would be forced to sell your home, then you would be a fool to invest $20,000.
If you borrow money that you can't reasonably expect to pay back unless your investment appreciates, then you are gambling, pure and simple.

Well then you are on the wrong website my friend.  Bitcoin has crashed many times before and it will crash again in the future.  But for the long run, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are here to stay.  If you can't see the value in cryptocurrencies in the pure utility that they provide then  I could see why you believe their value should be zero.  But there are enough people that understand and actually use this utility that cryptocurrencies provide, and this is where the value comes from.

This may be true-ish today, but probably won't be the case in 10 years or more.  And for the record, bitcoin is a worldwide currency, it exists beyond the United States.  It would take a coordinated effort by the international community to aggressively try to crack down on all cryptocurrencies, and I can tell you right now that although it could be effective if all countries participated (they wouldn't), there is no way to un-invent this technology.  It would be like trying to shut off the internet at this point.  For every node shut down, others will pop up in a never ending game of whack-a-mole.
In any case, if the US government were to crack down on it as you suggest, then this would imply that bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies do in fact perform the utility that they promise, demonstrating that they do in fact have value, because they would be usurping the USD of its utility, it if came to that.  I think your question implies that you realize that there is value there.

Because there is a serious effort happening right now so that control of bitcoin can be given to those who want have authority over it.

Well, except for the fact that ultimately if bitcoin were to serve its ultimate purpose of usurping the almighty dollar, it may (or may not) hurt the banks in the long run.
However, banks aren't stupid.  They will continue to do the same shit in the future with whatever currency(s) are in circulation, whether it be USD or bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency.
HOWEVER, the one primary difference between the relationship that banks have with bitcoin and the relationship they have with the USD is that they some direct influence and control at the level of the federal reserve.  With bitcoin, they will never have that amount of control, and if they did, bitcoin would fail.  In this way, bitcoin may in the future be a device that prevents certain market behaviors caused by manipulations from big banks.
And so, if banks are just playing the bitcoin market in order to make a short-term profit, along the path that ultimately leads to a worldwide bitcoin adoption, then banks may or may not be simply profiting short-term in a system that will destroy them.

1.  It is a land grab for sure, but like anything it was an investment with some small risk (as in, some people spent money on hardware to mine bitcoins without any promise of a return on investment).  Yes, some early adopters made very good returns on their investments but there isn't any inherent corporate agenda here.  It was a protocol published anonymously that was adopted by the masses.  Satoshi may (or may not) have made lots of money in the process but I don't think that was primarily his objective.
2.  The reason why lots of energy is going into mining is because it is crucial that bitcoins are released at a predictable rate.  As the network's processing power increases, the difficulty increases

Well you are right in the fact that to go on strike for less pay would in fact be foolish.  However, I don't think that would be the case.  I look at countries in Europe and I believe they have a much better culture and system of tipping.  What I am advocating is a basic minimum standard of work conditions.  
Employers in the US pay waiters less than minimum wage because they legally can with the expectation that they will earn tips.  And if you aren't getting enough tips?  The employer can fire you at any moment.  Most of these employers also do not offer any benefits or vacation time to these employees.  In Europe again, most countries mandate that every employee gets about 4 weeks of vacation every year, regardless of employer.  That is completely unheard of in the US.

I watched the video without knowing very much about the history of the federal reserve bank, and the video comes along and brings a story that, while it definitely seems far-fetched and pandering to conspiracy nuts, seems plausible.  You come and dismiss the film calling it bullshit, but without presenting me a different side of the story.  If it is bullshit, what is the truth?  I am open minded and I want to know the truth.  
For somebody who is uneducated in this topic, it's hard to know what to believe based off of the information found on the surface.  Doing a bit of quick googling of "Red Shield" I realized its about the Rothschild family.  Wikipedia mentions several things about how the family is very wealthy and how they played a part in the Napoleonic wars and that they historically conducted business lending money and continue to do so today.  None of this surface information discredits what I just watched in the video. 
After reading the wikipedia article, I have no evidence to believe that anything in the video isn't true, even if it seems far-fetched.  
Do you have any sources that can discredit the video?

The bitcoin market cap is equal to the current amount of bitcoins in circulation (volume) multiplied by the value per bitcoin (trading price).

You are absolutely right.  But what else can be done to fix this?  As I mentioned, blood had been shed to fight for improved work conditions.  A very large portion of jobs in the US are service sector minimum wage jobs.  Many of the people who work those jobs are living paycheck to paycheck barely making ends meet.  The income inequality is enormous.  
  
  Personal income in the US:  
decreasing over time.
GDP per capita in the US: 
  
  increasing over time.
The country is making more money but individuals are keeping less.  How much longer can this trend continue until inequality is so great the poverty is commonplace?
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:35:19
This is probably the most realistic explanation of the situation, and it is quite sobering.  It's not that nobody sees it as a problem, it's that it's really difficult to fix from a political point of view.   
However, today we have a tool that never existed years ago: the Internet.  Years ago blood was literally shed for workers rights, and while workers fought for certain work conditions, I believe they have deteriorated over the years to the point where much of the population is receiving the lowest legally allowable wage possible with zero benefits.  
I believe the internet needs to be used to rally all service-sector employees who are not receiving good work conditions to go on strike and retake good work conditions without violence.  It would be difficult to orchestrate, but not impossible.  Imagine if we could agree on a date in the future, and advertise as much as possible for all waiters to not go into work that day and all following days until demands were met.  Even if we could reach a number like 50% of the waiters in the country to agree to go on strike that day, imagine the chaos that would be caused.  Yes many people would lose their jobs, but how much longer can we deal with these shitty jobs that we have?

It would remove the culture of tipping and remove the onus of the customer to be guilted into tipping.  I fucking hate tipping.  What is the definition of a tip?  "A sum of money given to someone as a way of rewarding them for their services."   
  A tip is a reward.  Why the fuck should I reward somebody for being mediocre at their job, which 80% of waiters are?  If a waiter provided me with excellent service, I am happy to tip, otherwise I feel like I am being swindled.
