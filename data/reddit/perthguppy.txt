some one that smart would know the easy way to prove it is PGP keys, which is how satoshi proved he wasnt dorian last time.

Yes. Exactly this. To explain away why if he was SN he didnt have access to the 1.1m btc and genisis block he claimed it was all locked away in a trust until 2020. That way he can tell investors that he just needs the loan for 5 years until the trust unlocks. By that point he is hoping to have earned back the money in other ways.

Supercomputers on the scale he was talking about are not cheap. I helped install a super computer in the top 100 a couple years back, it required a whole new datacenter to be built to house it, and teams from Cray to be flown out to spend literally months installing and configuring it.

I am personally expecting it is not the real Satoshi, and some time in the next 48 hours another signed satoshi message will appear saying "I am not Craig Wright"
I don't expect Satoshi to issue a denial for every wild guess the community comes up with, but I would expect him to issue a denial if some guy engineers a lot of evidence to fake being Satoshi.

Google's head of Wallet has posted before that they are keeping an eye on bitcoin and may integrate it in the future. Further more there are many googlers who have used their 20% time to make bitcoin contributions. When the time is right they will probably integrate it. The thing most likely holding them back is bitcoins volitility right now, it is always improving, and the recent invrease in VC going into bitcoin companies is helping, so maybe in a year or so we will see google officially jump on board. 
Google would not ever introduce btc tipping as a competitor to wallet though, but they will probably introduce btc into wallet.

I'm sorry. The price is currently over 20x higher than what it was 12 months ago, and 8x what it was 6 months ago. And guess what? people have been bitching and hating on mt gox for far far far longer than that. Their actions have not dragged down the price any more than any other random wind change. 


But they are by far not the worst. 
If it was not for Mt Gox i can guarentee bitcoin would not be the success it has been so far. They did far better than anyone else at dealing with the rise of bitcoin, and that is exactly why they attained the market leading position that they did, but as soon as that happened everyone became an expert and started hating on them for every tiny mistake that happened and every potential loss of money for the day (hour?) traders and speculators out there.

Mt Gox has been having problems since before the peak a couple months back. Fiat withdrawals are still either closed or facing major delays for pretty much all currencies i thought.


How is it destroyed? Because they tempoarily closed withdrawals to BTC? Jesus christ. Be glad they haven't dissapeared into the night with everyone's money like countless other exchanges over the years. Would you rather them stayed open until they lost all the money instead?


They were open and upfront about the fiat witdrawals, if you put money in under thoes conditions assuming anything else you were an idiot. If you needed to get money out you do exactly as you said and take the (small) loss. If you put your money in before they had all their problems that was before the price surge so you would have been making a huge profit anyway when you withdrew elsewhere.


I was there for each of thoes events, and in each of thoes events the market dipped for maybe a few days max before recovering. If you were one of thoes idiot speculators and lost money during that time instead of being patient your fault. Price like i said is 10-20x higher today than it was at any price during thoes times. No value ultimatly was lost.

But bitcoin does not mean free banking. If it is to become viable in the long term for miners to continue to operate then transaction fees need to be paid, and a hell of a lot more transaction fees than what is paid or suggested to be paid now. Without the fees the size of the mining pool will shrink in a couple years when the 'reward' halves a couple more times, leaving only the few who are mining for 'the good of the currency' and thoes who intend to try and game the system. Mining isnt cheap, so most people not making a financial gain will leave making it far easier to do attacks on the network. Remember you don't actually need 51% to attack the network, just enough to be able to solve a couple of consecutive blocks, which can be done with just a few percent of the network and enough time.

back then he is using the term "digital coin" to describe the wallet. when you send bitcoin to a new wallet where you are not sending the entire amount you send the remainder to yourself by signing the remainder with the public key of your own wallet. this bit is hidden from the user though normally
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:53:46
You need at least 2 people to hold the key in case something happens to the first person. Satoshi doesnt count as he effectivly no longer exists. Once some one has the key you cant revoke it, so you have to pick some one long term, and the operator of the largest community was the correct pick. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:51:41
What if Satoshi is Dorian, and he was upset about all this negative news about mt gox ruining bitcoin's name, so he allowed a publication to discover him, then after a day or two of the internet going nuts, posts as satoshi saying its not him, further making the internet going nuts, and suddenly no one cares about mtgox anymore

False. What if the exchange's master wallet gets compromised and all funds get transfered from that? Then the exchange is bankrupt and everyone loses their money. What if the database behind the exchange gets compromised and the attackers change everyones wallet address through that sort of admin access? Then everyone loses their money.

Nah. I got out around $300 or so. I actually remember having an old wallet with 13btc that was on an old drive i threw out years ago that I had totally forgotten about. Of course if I still had it I would have sold it by now. When I originally stopped using that wallet it was probably only worth $200 or so, and was a small portion of my mining revenue of the time. But at times like this it is fun to be able to say I once threw away a drive with what is now $40000 AUD. 
My mate around the same time managed to corrupt his ext4 file system that had a wallet with 250btc on it. He kept the drive for years and every time a bit coin bubble hit the news he would take another crack at recovering it. I think he finally gave up a couple years back and tossed the drives. He still has a couple of the physical coins some one made up in 2010 or so. I think he has a couple 5btc denominations and maybe some larger ones. He keeps them as a souvineer and is steadfast against selling them.

I'm not sure what calculations the other prices are using, my number comes from the following:
For the currency to be effective its smallest unit mus be worth less than 1 - 0.1 US cents
The (current) smallest unit of bitcoin is 1/100 000 000th of a bit coin
$0.01 * 100 000 000 = $1 000 000USD
$0.001 * 100 000 000 = $100 000USD

Wait. Why the fuck did they decide to suspend for 12 hours???? the first time? I would have suspended for 20 minutes, THEN if shit is crazy when it comes back online freeze it again.
Also they should introduce some API limits during high load times - throttle the top 10-20% of API users until load returns to normal.

A block is essentially a list of transactions. The more transactions the larger the block. Currently there are 2 limits, a 'soft' limit of what the current reference client will accept by default. This was previously 300kB but was user changeable. This update increases that default to 350kB, and is still user adjustable. The second limit is a 'hard' limit of the maximum sized block the network protocol will accept. This is currently at 1MB, and to change it would require all nodes be updated. Because this is a complex undertaking the dev team are investigating / coding a new system that would not require a maximum block size so we don't have to change the protocol like this again. Because of the complexity of the change they are taking their time to make sure they do not introduce unexpected bugs. We still have time though before we start consistently hitting the 1MB limit. Hitting the limit once every so often isnt a big deal, it will just mean transactions are delayed a block until they can fit in, and there is a new block every 6-12 minutes on average.

@_date: 2013-04-10 14:50:39
The abaslute maximum value before the entire currency breaks down into a steaming pile of shit is $1million per btc, but if it got above $100 000 we would be in trouble. 
Of course that would imply a 'market capitalization' of about $1-2 trillion. 
As a comparison the US annual GDP is $15 trillion global GDP is $70trillion USD, and there is approximately US$1.18 Trillion in cash in circulation. 
Depending on what ultimate purpose bitcoins end up serving, they could be in trouble if they grow very popular and become an actual every day alternative to cash globally.
EDIT: Also anyone with half a brain would know not to trust a guy who has just said he has put all of his eggs literally (and then some) into one basket.

Indeed. When I wrote the comment i thought it was going down for 50 minutes, and didnt know about the extended database maint.
However a 20minute shutdown even with hour long lags would be enough to clear the backlogs. The system would be able to catch up on all the orders since no new ones are being made. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:45:13
Well, we just hit $219 and $224 is not outside the realm of possibility if some largish orders come through again in the next half an hour

You realise that there is exponential fall off right? By 2027 there will be 20m bitcoins on the market, which is close enough to all bitcoins that will ever be mined. 
Also it is false to assume all bit coins that will ever be mined will ever be in cirulaiton. People are losing wallets all over the place which essentially destroys them permently. 
So being optomistic and saying that there will only ever be 20M coins in circulation that puts a market cap of $2trillion if each coin is valued at $100 000, which means the smallest transaction you can make is 1/10th of a cent. If we got to that point people would start to be concerned by the currency hitting a wall where you cant make transactions small enough for what you need.

The time it takes to mine a block is a function of network power divided by difficulty. The difficulty is only recalculated once every 2016 blocks (in theory this should be 2 weeks) based on the speed at which the previous 2016 blocks were solved. The difficulty is adjusted to bring the average back to 10 minutes per block.
The reason why block time is currently at 5 minutes is because total network capacity is growing at an exponential rate thanks to all the ASIC's coming on, and unfortunately total power has approximately doubled since the last difficulty recalculation occurred (not sure of this, just assuming so if block time is currently averaging 5 minutes). Expect to see difficulty double next recalc.

Its usually quite hard to get your clearnet IP through JS. Remember JS is not the same as Java. The TOR developers though made the decision to enable JS on the browser bundle by default to make it more user friendly.

Exactly, i have an order for their smallest unit, im willing to loose that much money on what i view as a 50% chance of actually shipping. If / when they ship and my predictions for the global hash rate turn out to be accurate i might go for one of the 50ghash units.

Yeah, i realise, also im guessing whoever is answering the questions (i thought some one said its the CEO) probably isnt one of the engineers and is more a business / pr person. My original comment was more tounge in cheek at the poor timing of the DDOS starting just as the AMA was annouced.
@_date: 2013-08-04 16:09:43
So 2 major and interesting events happened in the last few days.
1. Irish federal police take a man into custody on an FBI extradition warrant. FBI claims this guy runs FreedomHost on TOR and as a result is the largest CP dealer in all of history (a bit of a stretch)
2. Soon after people notice an iFrame embedded on all pages served by Freedom Host that runs some javascript originally hosted on a clearnet IP belonging to a Verizon business customer in the Washing DC area, and soon after news of this breaks it changes to be hosted by a TOR hidden service. Analysis of the script is ongoing but looks like some complex ZeroDay exploit targeting TOR Browser Bundles with Firefox version 17 and higher.
Normally I would just think the JS thing is just some hackers such as anonymous doing one of their operations, but given in the FBI extradition hearing they claimed that they had analysed the targets computer and found he was a flight risk because of his recent browsing activity, I would say it is a very safe bet if he is indeed owner of FreedomHost that the FBI themselves gained access to the servers and planted the code.
The big question remains, how did the FBI trace the FreedomHost hidden services back to physical computers? A while ago I did some basic back-of-the-envelope maths and theorized that if some entity owned a significant chunk (talking like 5-10% or more) of the TOR router nodes (not just exit nodes) then they could use statistical analysis to map ANY hidden service to a real IP.
At this point I would be worried that TOR is compromised at a fundamental level and is no longer safe for hiding traffic from state entities eg for whistle blowing activities.

IIRC a bug in the bitcoin client caused a network split of the block chain, the emergency system was used to alert everyone and an emergency patch was made.

If by trivial you mean get everyone to upgrade to a new version of clients that support a revised network protocol, yes. It would be as trivial as moving the internet to IPv6

stealing all of mtgox's bitcoins would be a catch 22 situation. if you managed to pull it off at the moment they would be rendered practically useless to you as the value would be destroyed. it would also be very hard to get that many coins out of any other exchange as every pissed off nerd would be watching the block chain like a hawk.

Well some one (or multiple people in co-ordination) is currently selling off 40k bitcoins and counting.
EDIT: Looks they finished at around 45k coins, on the bright side looks like the 12 hour maint on the exchange worked, not a single sign of that horrible lag of the last few weeks.

ASIC's crunch the SHA2 algorithm used for mining, no one is suggesting a flaw in that algorithm, what they are suggesting is a flaw in the ECC algorithm which is used in the wallet keypair system. Changing that algorithm would have no impact on the hashing side of things, so no changes to ASIC would be required.

I did some rudimentary maths recently to try and project where the global hash rate will end up over the next 6 months and ended up at approximatly 250 000 Ghash, or about 4 times where it is at the moment, the increase thanks to all the ASIC's that may come online in that time. Also BFL have downgraded their ASIC to be 50Ghash, so you can expect to get about 0.72 btc per day from mining on it. It is probably you're best hope right now of turning a profit (assuming it ships)
For records the 2 assumptions I made in my calculations were that BFL is selling chips at cost of the silicon manufacturing only(a worst case scenario) and that a run of ASIC silicon manufacture would cost $4million (a price i found somewhere, cant remember where). If anyone has any more accurate costings / yeilds of the ASIC manufacture cost it would be great to know.
@_date: 2013-09-29 15:25:52
Sure, but they do not have to build their whole persistent economy on the currency, just offer it as a payment option.
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:48:52
TBH, if we are worried about flaws being exploited in ECC and the 256bit key being too short, we should be jumping to 1024 not 500/512 as we want this to last as long a time as possible before having to make another jump. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:35:04
Yeah, 10% per week isnt that bad, i was more meaning if it keeps up the pace of the last 6 hours or so and hits $300 in the next 12-18 hours.
@_date: 2013-08-04 16:58:45
even if they allowed you to run insecure code, no reason why the servers couldnt be behind a firewall running iptables that tunnels all connections via TOR - i have a couple mates who do that (and can toggle it at will). To any one running code on the box all they can see is a private IP (eg 192.168.0.x address).
I think you are also confused about what this JS was targetting, it is pretty clear it is targetting the end user who views the sites, and not the hosts themselves.

I think he was asking if they ever cash out some of the money assigned to the traders. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:47:20
They wont accept credit card payments as it is too easy to initiate a charge back and Mt gox would have no way to recover the money.
Consider this thought experiment. A bunch of bad guys steal a credit card and go and transfer $5000 into their mtgox account. They then spend all of that money on bitcoins and immediatly transfer them away from mtgox. A few days / weeks / months down the track the bank finally initiates a charge back due to fraud (it can take 3 months for a chargeback to go though), and as it was a fraudulent transaction mtgox looses all of that money. Now repeat this dozens of times per hour / day as the bad hackers have 100's of stolen credit cards.

How does openstack(or AWS or EC etc) allow you to scale a transactional database? I am sure there are many in the industry that would love to know.
Also setting up Openstack is actually not 'fairly simple' and there are very few people around  still that have the skills required. You cant just get up one day and decide "you know what im going to deploy an openstack cluster"
@_date: 2013-08-04 16:15:47
Lots of people have read through the code, but the payload is quite well obfuscated and largely written in generic variable names and there is a LOT of hex in there, so analysis is going to require a fair bit of trial, error, analysis.
Given the complexity it is a safe assumption it is some sort of new 0day, and given the context of where its found it is probably leaking something to clearnet.

There is no reason why they building a system like paypal would not be better. It is simpler from a logical and logistical point of view and from a legal and regulatory point of view. You pay them money, you get a balance on your account etc, when you withdraw they send you money and reduce your balance accordingly, and is essentially what they are already building. Bitcoin does not solve or offer a solution to the problem of converting regular money to the currency, and in fact makes it more complicated to implement. If they want it to be successful it has to be as easy and as simple as possible for normal every day people to use, and at the moment bitcoin is not there yet so it would be silly to use bitcoin to power their system, then have to engineer a whole bunch of solutions to fix bitcoin to their liking.
