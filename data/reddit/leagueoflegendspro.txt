Actually, I started trading btc 2 years ago on mtgox, transfered to btc-e in may/june last year, from there to bitstamp in september, and since few weeks ago, to Cryptsy and bought doge. So your argument is invalid, but if you are asking from where do I withdraw money, its Bitstamp from the beggining...
@_date: 2014-01-21 01:33:51
well that makes sense if you have big BTC volume. Unlike me, but that is about to change! :D
@_date: 2014-01-21 01:11:24
Montenegro, yeah, I thought so...

I am mining on Eligius, and I get regular payouts. Can you please tell me what is so bad about Eligius?

Actually, I've withdrew bitcoins through bitstamp on my private bank account, so if there would be need for that, I think it wouldn't be such a problem. I've started this about a week ago, and had only one btc customer for now, but I am not losing hope and looking forward to day when I will say: "Euro not accepted anymore!" :D

LOL! not that small :D
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:30:57
oh shut the hell up! Its people like you that drive unnecessary panic. If you had any solid proof of that happening, post, else, do NOT!
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:50:23
Can you please give us some proof that it actually happened? It is pretty much big news if it is true!
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:50:14
lol, you clearly have no idea how it works... If BTC fails, LTC and every other cryptocurrency (yes, even Dogecoin) will be worth nothing as well.

Thanks for reply, it may not work here, because people are kind of scared of "imaginary", as they call it, money, but nevertheless, I made 20 offline wallets containing 2 mBTC each, and I've already given 10 of them to people who I think will make good use of them. I'll post some pictures of remaining wallets if you guys would like to see, and possibly give idea to few other redditors :)

Well, what can I say... F*CK Webroot! -.-
@_date: 2014-01-21 01:06:03
I will, thanks for reply!

Montenegro, Bar specifically, It's by Adriatic sea
@_date: 2014-01-21 01:13:04
Yes exactly my point, so then, I ask myself why small businesses would need to complicate things with coinbase or similar websites when they can do same themselves?
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:21:48
How about I give you gox coins at price of Bitstamp?
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:49:57
It is not all about the price...
@_date: 2014-01-18 23:32:13
Just look at price graphs and you will get the idea. There have been periods of more than 6 months where price was about the same (in 2011 and 2012) and even last year after big dump from 266 to 55 it stabilized for few months on 140. So no, this is not FINAL stable price, but rather quiet period before pumping/dropping again. Just compare this "stability" With one that was before:

Can you share some links with in-depth info about it? :)
@_date: 2014-01-21 01:11:52
Good call, I totally forgot about it! Thanks for reminder
@_date: 2014-01-21 13:42:26
Nice suggestion, I might as well do that, and give a brief speech about it too! If it gets into newspapers, I am definitely posting it here! :D
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:45:20
Yes, but I've seen cases of people waiting for more than few weeks to get their money... There is a fuss about Mt.Gox especially, but people also complained about Bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:23:16
Well, I thought 72k readers compared to 5k will give me more answers sooner. But I will try there if I don't succeed here, thanks for reply!
