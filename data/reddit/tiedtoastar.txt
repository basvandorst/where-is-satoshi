Monero is meant for small businesses. It's just like cash in that when you receive it you don't have the ability to check what it was used for previously.
With bitcoin you could be implicated with illicit activities. Bitcoin favors large businesses that can afford to pay chain analysis companies to verify that the bitcoin txs haven't been tainted.

Agreed, so privacy by default is needed.
Few will adopt private transactions on bitcoin, it costs more, it's harder to use, and people who do use it will see their utxo's drop in value (not fungibile) .

Shitcoin buyers have said the same thing. Look at where they are now.
If you want privacy use monero, if you want a store of value use bitcoin, if you want a stable coin use DAI.

So you're settling for "good enough" money? Fungibility is a key feature of sound money, and you need better than "good enough" privacy to have it.
