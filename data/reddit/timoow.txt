If you would be so kind to take some time (if you haven't already) to take a look at Sirius' Identifi ( and provide critique, that would be more than welcome, and probably helpful. If so, thank you in advance.

What I'm trying to say is that there can be no extrinsic value without any intrinsic value, and inversely proportional. Therefor, the concept of extrinsic value, in all its varieties, is to be understood in terms of the concept of intrinsic value.

Showing eBay and Amazon that 1M people are lining up to pay them in BTC, will convince other (small local) shops to start accepting them. It's about creating awareness to businesses that we want them to take our bitcoins, and that there's a lot of us out there.
@_date: 2014-09-21 02:24:19
Thanks for that one. I hadn't heard of it before, and after reading the wiki on it the whole dystopian part of it certainly makes me curious for reading it.
To get back from Whuffie to Identifi, the idea here is to make it open-source and decentralized, before a centralized party steps in and does just that. This is why I hope that in the long run it will steer us towards a utopia, instead of a dystopia. In the end it's always about how we humans use our tools.

I'm making a statement here; I don't actually believe that they will start accepting BTC anytime soon.
It's just that when 1M people would make this statement, that it would send out a strong signal to other businesses to start accepting them. Free market at its best, right?

Yeah, gave it some big cookies and it said "DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-964, SQLSTATE=57011, SQLERRMC=null, DRIVER=4.16.53". Not sure if it has to do with the csv-file or with Watson though.

The best censorship is self-censorship; letting each person decide for themselves what their bullshit filters look like. In my most humble opinion, you gents should really take an in-depth look at Sirius' [Identifi]( I really don't understand we (the Bitcoin community) aren't using this yet (read: building on-top of it) for our fora and other communication channels. Just follow the white rabbit.
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:12:03
Thank you :)
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:11:14
The platform does exactly what the title says. Is the platform perfect? No, probably not. Is it a centralized platform? Yes, it is. Would we probably prefer a trustless platform over the one I've currently chosen for? Probably, yes.
To dissect the title and elaborate a bit further: "I'm now funding ALL THE DEVS IN THE WORLD who are working on the Bitcoin Core, via Bitcoin, and pro rata."
Anyone who works on the Bitcoin Core in Github will be able to take their share of what they've contributed to the project, in ratio to the total amount of donations made to the Bitcoin address.
Sorry, but I don't see how that's misleading. I didn't mean to imply that I'm now the sole ruler of Bitcoin and hosing money down on everyone, only that I can now do it, and so can you.

@_date: 2015-04-10 12:45:06
I agree on that there's no perfect way to distribute this, just like when you work for an employer. As I mentioned in the previous post, any suggestions on good (decentralized) alternatives are more than welcome.
Mobbr organizes the funding. I fund, and so can anyone else.
Again, if you have any questions regarding Mobbr, they've opened up an AMA for that specific goal.
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:58:07
I totally agree that the system isn't perfect, but I just don't know of any better alternative to use for this for now. Again, I'm open for suggestions.
Mobbr has also elaborated on the algorithm in another comment.
@_date: 2015-04-05 20:54:54
Dealing with quality is out of the current scope... for now. It basically does the calculations on what it can extract from the GitHub stats. I agree that there's room for improvement here. Like I said in the original post, I'm not aware of any decentralized alternatives that can handle this matter, so that's why I chose Mobbr for now. If anyone has suggestions for alternative platforms, I'm all ears.
Concerning worries about the IRS and special tax filings:
As far as I know, the guys of Mobbr have already implemented a lot of functions and have come a long way working towards that goal. I'm not really sure about the exact details, so lets wait for them (probably till tomorrow) and have them reply to that concern themselves. I wouldn't want to speculate on this.
@_date: 2015-04-04 04:04:11
Lets say you have an awesome product, and where it comes to finding your first and all the other customers you have a classic chicken/egg problem. Where do you start?
In this case, businesses wouldn't implement it without the consumers using it already, and vice versa.
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-04-05 23:12:22
No hard feelings. I don't really have to add anything to it though, so I'll just stick to work hard, play hard, sleep hard for now.
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:26:48
I agree that it could use some love yeah.
With "proof on our own identities", I mean the whole "Hi Reddit my name is %name%"-picture on twitter kinda thingy, in my next post on Reddit on this topic.
I haven't seen the part where it asks for pictures or a copy of my ID, and you shouldn't need this for extracting the funds. In the next post I'll attach a manual for people to follow, on how to retrieve their funds, such as screenshots or a video on how-to.
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:58:43
Thanks man. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2015-04-04 04:25:54
Mind blown! ;-)
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:50:56
Mobbr's CEO, Patrick Savalle, just messaged me. He says that anyone who has funds waiting for him/her will receive an e-mail about this tonight, and that it probably has to do with a cronjob.
He's in bed already, so we'll have to wait for this one till tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:20:35
Part two: 
@_date: 2015-04-05 20:45:34
-----------UPDATE FROM OP------------
Some users seem to be experiencing issues with withdrawing their share of the entitled pay-outs at the moment. Mobbr.com is working on it and I hope that the issues for the affected users will be resolved soon. Still, I'd like to advice people to wait with making any further donations until these problems have been resolved. It would have been cool if everything had run super-smooth tonight, but it didn't. Shit happens, people are working on it, and no people died thus far. Yay!
In the highly unlikely case that this thing scales up to BITCON 1; that the Bitcoin Core devs aren't able to retrieve the funds in the end, I will personally return the 0.16936461 BTC to everyone that has donated to the address thus far, and will pay for the tx fees myself.
To take away any doubt about me being here to scam anyone, I am verifying that I am me on twitter. If you'd like to know more, feel free to ask and we'll turn this thread into a mini-AMA ---&gt; 
If you know me and would like to vouch for me, you can simply add that^ tweet to your favorites. Thanks in advance!
I've sent messages to the guys at Mobbr.com through various platforms. It's Sunday-night 22:44pm (at the time of writing) here in the Netherlands, and Easter at the same time, so there is a chance that they're not going to respond to this today. I'll do what I can to make sure that it works for you and that you'll receive your fair share of what I / we have contributed.
I do know some of the guys at Mobbr personally, including its CEO, and I wouldn't have chosen this path if I was unsure about the platform itself. I hope this sufficiently answers this issue for now, even though I know how tough it can be to trust someone you don't know on the Internet... almost always. That's why sirius and I are working on Identifi, a peer-to-peer identification &amp; reputation network, but that's a story for another time :-)
I'll assume we both agree on how any kind of trustless system (multi-party escrow, Nakamoto consensus, etc.) would be preferable over the current situation concerning the funds for the devs.
You have my word that I'll do whatever I can to get you your fair share of Satoshis!
Happy easter and thank you for your work on Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:42:45
I agree, and as I've said earlier, I couldn't come up with a better one for now. I'm all ears for viable alternatives that we can start using right now though.
@_date: 2015-04-05 22:46:17
That's right, the address doesn't belong to the Bitcoin Core devs themselves. It has been created through Mobbr, so people can donate to it, after which the devs can claim their share from the Mobbr platform.
I'm not familiar with the exact workings of the algorithm that Mobbr uses to determine who gets what. Since I don't, I'm not going to speculate on it and will leave it to the Mobbr team to elaborate on it. It doesn't sound logical though that it would be based on blind commit counts solely, no.
By the way, for those who are afraid that I'm a scammer, let me do some doxing for you. Here's my twitter with full name, etc.: 
I'll tweet a URL to this comment for verification. If you have any more questions because you believe that I might be a scammer, feel free to ask for more proof on that I'm not.
update: 
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:57:41
I'm currently working on any possible issues that might arise when we try this again, and that we could think of at forehand, to then return with more information in a part 2. Again, we're gonna solve this.

Latest news: Getting up early tomorrow (read: today) to go to the Mobbr office and sit down with their team to make sure we solve this.

I concur.
I'll try and get the Mobbr.com guys on here, so they're able to answer any of the questions people might have, and/or listen to feedback.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:11:51
Yes I did. We came up with a plan for part 2 of this thread, which we hope to post somewhere at the end of this week / during the weekend.
Mobbr's answers sounded fair enough to me, but I'll let anyone be the judge of that themselves in the upcoming part, where they'll join us to answer any of the questions you might have.
When we get back to you with part 2 we're planning on providing a manual on how to retrieve the funds (since some developers prefer to use a different address than the one they've used to sign up to GitHub with, which works, but with a small work-around), some more proof on our own identities, proof that it's working (via verifications of developers), and support from the Mobbr team in case anyone does bump into any issues again.
Any other suggestions you might have are more than welcome.
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:16:21
By the way, if anyone can confirm/deny this and/or provide some error codes, that'd be more than helpful.

Lighthouse is currently in beta, and I'm not sure if it can do what Mobbr does, let alone better.

Can we (already) do this with Lighthouse?
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:32:32
I couldn't go over there today because of my busy schedule, so we've planned a skype call for tonight. Also, I'm in touch with one of the Bitcoin Core developers to help me test everything, so that we know sure that it works before I return to you guys for the second round.
I'm not sure exactly how many people work at their office, but I do know that it's more than one. I'll ask your question during our call tonight and will get back to you!
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:58:22
I totally agree that the system isn't perfect, but I just don't know of any better alternative to use for this for now. Again, I'm open for suggestions.

Part two: 
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:18:52
Well, technically, I assume that that's a yes. They probably own the Bitcoin address and it's an automated system. It is transparent though, since you can simply follow every little satoshi that you donate, and up to €5,000 there's no fee. There's a 1% fee over €5,000 though.
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:53:17
ps: I meant it in a good way. I can't wait for it getting out of beta, just to clear that one up in case stuff got lost in translation (pardon my Dutch).
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:36:43
I like your thinking. The more voluntary &amp; user-in-control, the better.
@_date: 2015-04-05 23:17:48
One of the problems with centralized parties can be the proprietary software... So, I'm not sure how to do that at the moment, but the discussion itself seems to show the need for such a system.
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:36:12
Today was an experiment (from my side), yes. Also, I agree to your point c) all of the above.
Will we ever establish Nakamoto consensus over any kind of subjective logic? Probably not.
Looking at the amount of attention this post has received over the last 12 hours or so, I still believe that posting it was worth the shot. I really liked the constructive debate that followed, and I hope that there's someone in the room who's smarter than me and can figure out a way, or at least a 'better' alternative (whatever that may be). It's just that I really don't want to trample on their optimism just yet. :-)

I see your point, but I'm not going to judge a person by, or discuss, his need of sleep. I do know that this guy regularly works very long hours, so I think I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt here. Tomorrow is also a holiday here in the Netherlands, and he has already promised to look at it in the morning. I don't think that we'll solve everything tonight anyway, nor that the world is going to end if we don't. So, now... we wait.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:19:22
I forgot to ask your question about how many people work at their office, sorry for that. During our Skype call he did receive a phone call from one of his colleagues... So that sets the count to at least 2! ;-)
I was thinking about asking him to do an AMA at the same time as when we post part 2. That way, you could ask him this question and any others you might have yourself.
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:17:59
Yes. The system isn't perfect. I'm open to any suggestions for better alternatives!
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:37:50

Thanks for the feedback. I'm not sure either about that, but it's probably helpful to the guys who will have to solve this. I'm sorry that this is happening to you guys. I've seen it working in the past, so I'm sure they'll get it working again soon. I'll make sure to keep you all updated.

I'm not familiar with how they do that, but I'll look into it. Thanks for the suggestion.
Side-chains are definitely interesting material, but I don't believe there's a way to use them for this at the moment. If there are decentralized alternatives for this that we can start using right away, don't hesitate to share them with us!

12.) Replied to an e-mail from Cryptsy customer support almost 20 hours ago, with the answer to the security question they posed, and am still waiting for their reply / further support. I've also asked why they couldn't simply just authenticate me through the 2FA, which I have enabled. To me it seems like a much easier, quicker, and more secure solution. Also, it would be automated &amp; thus more cost-efficient for them.
Now, we wait some more.

I can't say if it's deliberate, but they aren't making this easy.
1.) Reset password: enter both username, and e-mail, instead of only the e-mail address;
2.) Receive e-mail with password reset link;
3.) Reset password via link in e-mail;
4.) Try logging in, to no avail;
5.) See that another mail, subject "New Password", has arrived, with a seemingly randomly generated password.
6.) Copy this password, try it again, doesn' work;
7.) Try using the ' forgot password' function again, no e-mails arrive at this point;
8.) Waited 24 hours, try again, new e-mail arrives;
9.) Wait for 2nd e-mail, copy+paste seemingly random password, ha!
10.) Too bad. Due to 6 months of inactivity, I'll have to mail support first ...
