Good points. Imagine however that to open/close channel there will be very high fee so most people would only have 1 channel opened (to their 'money provider'). So technically yes you can route around by opening diferent channel same as now you can open different bank account, but the barrier is quite high. Is amount of open/close channel operations really that much smaller compared to amount of transactions in real world use? You cant leave channel opened with every friend you have or you would have no money to spend in a shop.

Can someone explain how will bitcoin survive once most of transactions are on lightling network? At one point mining wont be profitable due to low block reward. If we also move fees away from miners they will just quit mining making btc more vulnerable. Is there something I am missing? Perhaps for channel opening there will be some fee? Will the main chain be still required once we have lightning? Sorry for nooby questions.

Ok, so opening/closing channel will cost some fee. If the fee will be quite high there will be incentive to have fewest channels possible opened for longest possible. This will eventually lead to 3rd party 'hubs' which will have many opened channels and enough liquidity ... question emerges ... how is this 3rd party different from bank? Sure I can route money via some friend of friend, but since that is very unpractical, most people will route via hubs ... something doesnt feel right about all this ...

Well because in bank I have 1 channel and with that I can pay anyone. I thought that on LN money allocated in channel can only be used to pay the channel party. Equivalent of this would be that you would have account opened with each shop you ever buy from. To make it practical (transactions count &gt; channel opening count) there would additionally have to be quite a lot allocated in each channel.
As was pointed out to me, money in channels would be possible to spend even with other people and could be actually merged so there isnt the problem I thought there will be.

Thanks very much for explanation. Channel factories sound promising. I have to say thou that whole lightning network seems quite complex compared to single chain approach. Adoption of this can take quite long time. Every coin will probably face this eventually thou.

Hodling some BTC so wanted to understand if this really stands up to what people believe. So far I get good feeling about it, specially if all the channel stuff will be automatic same as packet routing in internet.

So if I have 5 channels opened each with 1BTC and want to pay someone 4BTC I would be able to do that without the need of closing 4 channels and putting money to one? Considering channel open/close is onchain operation with fee, frequent open/close operation could get very expensive quite quickly.

I see. Thats why I opened this post. I believe average user have absolutely no clue how lightning network would work. Thats where the doubt comes. Thank you for your input.

Its always good to listen both sides of argument. Roger version is quite simple to understand. LN is much more complex. Whitepaper is almost 60 pages long. People always fear what they dont understand ...

I love people who downvote for no reason ... I want to get educated and someone downvotes ...  If you have explanation then please share ... are you so afraid of arguments or what?

eth came up with security tokens, possibly whole stock exchange may one day happen on eth blockchain... and you will buy cofee with apple stock... and store your holding on hw wallet just like any money.... exchange them peer to peer without exchange... well I wouldnt rule out eth yet. There might be bright future for many projects out there.
