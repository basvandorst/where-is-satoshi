BISQ? I have never heard of it but I will definitely look into it. I use multiple payment methods for exchanges (buy/sell) hopefully that market has plenty of options.

So what you're saying is the displayed amount of BTC in your wallet isn't actually "yours"? Essentially any of these markets could pull an exit scam or attempt to do what they are doing to me now? I wasn't aware of any of this to be honest. Also thank you for the suggestion I'm checking out [exchangerates.pro]( right now!

Which markets are you referring to? I like using P2P exchanges however Localbitcoin and Paxful seem to be the only major players in this game.

Just received an email from paxful stating the issue would be resolved and upon further inspection they want me to try AGAIN to verify my ID. This is a SKETCHY company. Blatantly stealing my bitcoins at this point all they are doing is copy and pasting responses.

Now I am getting the same message copy and pasted everytime. Does anyone have a suggestion for getting my coin back WITHOUT giving my ID? They have given me about 50 reasons as to why I dont want to trust them with my ID information.
Here is the message thats been copy and pasted the past 4 days.

Posted in the paxful subreddit and was promptly removed! Typical.
