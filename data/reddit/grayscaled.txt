I actually did give that article a read earlier today - was really helpful.
Any insight to the live USB portion of my question? I feel like I should do this the offline way for my more substantial savings, even if it is 'advanced mode'.

Yeah what is this vogogo thing? I haven't signed in there in a while and just noticed normal direct withdrawals now cost $30... wtf?
@_date: 2013-03-04 04:34:54
thank you, I will check it out

Bitcoin - &lt;0.04 days to clear - fee like 10 cents

damn why won't the video load

"You agree on $100 USD total in $50 now, $50 later fashion, then buyer sends 1.25 BTC @ $40usd/btc = $50usd for first stage and then follows up with 1 BTC @ $50usd/btc = $50usd for second stage. :3"
Yes, this is exactly what I was planning on doing... simple enough. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:05:33
interesting... good thing it's only a few dollars
@_date: 2013-03-01 23:23:32
Well I'm making a test model for OP to print to see if the end result is any good.
@_date: 2013-02-27 16:22:47
I should have been more specific, it was step 4. The import/export tab won't open and gives me an error.
@_date: 2013-02-13 03:23:31
Ok haha, thanks for the answer.
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:31:10
I hope you guys can pull this off. Cavirtex has been dominating and it would be good to have some options.
@_date: 2013-03-07 16:31:56
One of my trades that didn't get filled in before the price jump managed to grab a couple btc at $34. Lucky I didn't close that trade
@_date: 2013-03-14 02:23:29
Is it Japan or Korea that has widespread NFC usage? I imagine they could integrate that tech with bitcoin fairly easily. I wonder how many Japanese even ~~use~~ know about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:22:01
Haha oh man... I see the resemblance though.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:32:30
Thanks for the suggestion. Yeah the color does look a bit flat.
@_date: 2013-08-31 00:44:28
I sold a couple btc when it was just over 100 a few weeks ago and then it decides to jump up $20... I didn't sell looking to buy back in for profit but man what a dick coincidence.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:55:48
This...can attest to people who know you start treating you differently.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:12:02
I'm going to read this later. Please let it be bullshit...
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:14:08
going on 23 hours
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:32:33
When cavirtex launched in beta. Bought a bunch, spent a bunch... 
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:45:44
damn good interview there
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:01:11
I canada we have libertybit and cavirtex. The former is nice because it allows email money transfer and has lower fees. The latter has higher fees but has been around longer and supports more banks I think. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:41:28
no fees and it was a tiny transaction so no doubt it is very low priority... but still
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:52:24
same thing happening for one of my transactions
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:57:38
It seems like this community just keeps getting more awesome everyday. Kudos to this guy 
@_date: 2013-03-04 02:31:25
wow, only two days ago!  Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:26:11
advertising you have a large amount of bitcoins is a bad idea - especially if you don't fully understand how it works...
@_date: 2013-03-09 17:58:08
Will there be an option to move to sd card? My phone has very little internal memory... 
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:21:20
It's not even that big of a sum in my case, but when your 'friend' starts begging you to sell to them at 1/2 the exchange rate then gamble it on satoshidice it kinda says something
@_date: 2013-10-20 21:44:21
This is kinda cool. A good first step I think.
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:33:25
  I've used this plugin, pretty good for displaying donation address and QR

Digital ≠ Virtual   ...c'mom people!
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:44:43
He called it! haha
@_date: 2013-03-02 02:13:35
3D printing probably isn't it then, maybe something like epoxy resin. Another problem would be getting the gallium out of the mold without scratching it because I've noticed it expands when it cools.
@_date: 2013-03-02 02:48:08
I checked again, this time the fee stayed the same while the price of BTC went up. Looks like there is a sync error in the way the prices and fees are being displayed...
@_date: 2013-03-02 12:50:00
Thanks for the instructions man, yeah it was an error lo as ding scripts so this should work 
@_date: 2013-02-20 03:25:22
Sweet, I've done all of the above. But now to check the balance of this wallet or send coins from it wouldn't re-downloading the block chain kinda defeat the point of all this security? 
Please excuse my ignorance, does the blockchain.info wallet solve this?
@_date: 2013-03-04 03:10:28
Will do!
@_date: 2013-03-14 16:51:05
I was going to post in bitcointalk but my account is still a newbie even though it is over a year old haha (I like reddit more)
@_date: 2013-02-19 04:54:53
  I got ubuntu and truecrypt ready, but how are SHA Hashes checked? 
I can't believe I've been using bitcoin for over a year now and am just starting to take security seriously o.o
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:25:58
Haha, well I come from a web design background so I guess I'm used to it by now.
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:47:07
I'm actually working on some coin molds to send to this guy if you haven't already. Btw the gallium I bought from you is really cool, but messy! If you did decide to sell molds of stuff along side your gallium I believe it could become pretty popular.
@_date: 2013-02-28 19:09:21
I made a simple ninja star mold in 3ds max... I exported it as .STL  can you make it happen?   Pm me an email and I can send the file
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:00:08
makes sense
@_date: 2013-03-02 03:13:20
Haha wow. They ought to lower that benchmark with the rising price...
