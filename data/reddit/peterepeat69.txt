Btc before Xmas headed above 20k
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:18:05
People set their bots at a particular sell price, then the market tumbles because everyone has set there sells the same.. a bot can’t sell to another bot that wants to sell.
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:29:06
Just awesome, keep it up!
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:47:21
Well your talking about “artificial scarcity”, indeed I can create a crypto tomorrow and say that it’s scarce, but real commodities have real scarcity, 
Yes the driving force to me seems that the mining itself shows value, and if you wiki btc you will see there maybe a future strategy to change btc all together and provide more coins to be mined, if this happens I think people will start to wake up a bit, there is something about this artificial scarcity which lives in fairy land..
But again won’t stop me investing short term, but I wouldn’t put my house on it.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:15:17
All btc will be mined by 2140
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:24:51
Time to buy British pounds!
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:13:23
Yes that’s ok, and yes I agree whole heartedly, BTC is what I call the “uniting currency”, the whole world is one with it and it does make logical sense, but even BTC itself has an expiry date not for quite some time, normal currency never expires.
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:01:39
So are you shorting in futures?
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:14:04
Charts are for wankers
@_date: 2018-09-11 00:18:40
I’d rather ride my bicycle 
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:03:58
Well averaging down is indeed fascinating but if you keep averaging down and run out of money at the bottom, you could be waiting a long time unless of course your buying put options or futures in bitcoin..
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:52:08
Valuing in dollars is the only way to value,
After all it’s real cash that buys a lambo not BTC.
@_date: 2018-09-27 03:18:12
Well that’s fine, but that means your looking for an incredible move within a short space of time, what if it takes 6 months ? And it goes the other way? 
Calculate your risks, if you have the money to put in the credit card by all means go ahead.. but don’t risk what you can’t afford to lose, otherwise it can be a downward spiral if things go sour.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:51:15
Wait for 3k
@_date: 2018-09-07 08:21:00
Amen to that 
@_date: 2018-09-27 03:09:12
Eh why would you borrow at 18% to buy bitcoin? take out a personal loan.
@_date: 2018-09-27 03:11:32
Too much support at 6k, your hoping for something that isn’t going to happen... and yes we are poised for another bull market.
@_date: 2018-09-11 07:54:25
Delusional... I’d say the guy that posted this is living in denial.
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:17:42
He’s right, nothing ever will Stop Bitcoin.. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 06:47:15
This is true it’s impossible to sleep overnight making a loss everyday, the only way to sleep is to get out of your position... especially if you have your house on the line.
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:16:49
Moon is over for a while.. wait for another dip.. Nice buying opportunity 
@_date: 2018-09-27 03:06:02
Actually the 6k support has just increased.. spam I hate it.
@_date: 2018-09-19 10:45:07
Based on faith brother, faith.. stay with that, that’s all you need..
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:53:45
Just remember the song “history never repeats, I tell myself before I go to sleep”..
An oldy but a goody.. and it’s saved me money.
@_date: 2018-09-07 08:22:10
This should be an alt coin meme lol
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:25:12
Yes but there is money to be made in mining, when this drys up, why would it have any value?
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:34:09
I actually think the reverse, btc itself isn’t Gold that can be used to make jewellery or used on electronics, in the end people will look at what it’s true value is which is actually nothing, tangibles/true resources like oil will will always have their place in society because they are actually used, it’s an argument that will always be there... and yes people will say that btc will eventually replace PayPal, can’t disagree.. but even today there is much confusion about BTCs real value.
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:59:59
Generally shorters have loser mentality...
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:46:05
Not now unfortunately bitcoin is headed below 5k
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:51:38
Smoke the cigar until it’s worth 5 cents then keep smoking.. cause that’s all it will be worth in the end sadly 
@_date: 2018-08-17 07:39:14
You’ll have to wait a year or so 
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:27:54
Almost.. you have wonderful insight I see
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:54:39
Your mother is way cool hodl!
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:58:43
Nice but wait 2 years for any real value bro..
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:01:13
It’s a very nice thought, but technical analysis itself is like throwing darts at a board..
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:20:54
Well said bro... I can tell you have common sense stay with that mindset 
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:07:41
Altcoiner should be second on this list... just an observation..
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:31:16
Anytime my zen brother, stay with the program
@_date: 2018-08-28 06:11:11
Even though I may disagree with the 2014 figures, the 2018 to 2019 figure will be about 5 times 2014 and 2015.. so hang on to your seat belts.. we are heading for a new high for BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:51:42
Lol nice one
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:05:48
That’s all ok brother remember that crypto investment itself has no time regulation like options or warrants which means you can hodl for many years and see a profit... I just hope you haven’t put your family dinner on the table... keep your investments small and enjoy a holiday with your other money.. and your life will be truely rewarded for sure 
@_date: 2018-08-25 07:38:59
Oh dear another fundamentalist, well we all know BTCs fundamentals, very sound and very bullish, if you look at similar charts on 2015, you will see the interest in BTC was much less, but today as we have new institutional investors in BTC, our new timeline is very different so far BTC has already outstripped history of 2015.. there is no doubt it will jump within the powers of zen that we understand, I can only ask my fellow peers that you don’t miss the boat this time.
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:43:28
I’ll have to agree they will reach new all time lows this time sadly
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:50:10
Ok so can I possibly start a discussion then? What is your actual argument? Did you lose some money? Are you waiting to buy in? I’m all ears with no bias by the way
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:29:29
Depends on how far the dip is yeh?
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:46:00
So what is your actual argument?
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:58:53
Never say never again Mr Bond....
@_date: 2018-08-14 10:54:26
Well if it’s on mars, that’s certainly better than the moon indeed.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:52:34
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:40:07
5 pizzas, now I’m regretting it.
@_date: 2018-08-25 07:42:15
He’s right here
@_date: 2018-08-15 11:06:53
This is true but 2018 is very different to 2013 as bitcoin itself is the new world currency and today there are a lot more institutional investors and many more people involved with investing in bitcoin.. so you will see a faster recovery compared to 2013.. and I will say very fast.
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:55:16
The dorito then turns into a vertical chip lol.
@_date: 2018-10-02 22:51:20
Yes, well we all know it’s limited supply,,. So I’ll have to go with bullish even though I have some weird gut feel, but I won’t trade it yet.
@_date: 2018-10-14 11:57:03
When you just don’t give a shit about all the comments above...
@_date: 2018-10-06 07:19:14
Agree lol
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:48:59
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:01:48
BTC will go to 50 k tomorrow!
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:48:16
This is a day trade pump and dump.. and will see bitcoin on a huge downturn
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:05:48
I doubt that
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:04:03
Well done, yep I was in for 20 days I’m happy.. wait for the next dip.
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:08:38
Never sell live in a cardboard box and never buy A Lambo,.. yeh awesome life because I avoided tax
@_date: 2018-10-22 07:53:57
Well if Richard Branson says it’s going to the moon, it’s going to the moon!
@_date: 2018-10-02 22:40:18
Perceived value of BTC, we all know it has massive support at 6k, maybe my own perception is off track a bit.
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:22:41
So what’s so special about it?
@_date: 2018-10-05 04:23:39
Lol yeh I forgot 
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:06:19
Yes 
@_date: 2018-10-27 21:49:50
Well that’s better than it dropping another 3000
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:02:30
Well I look at the price of amazon, utterly ridiculous for something that makes only 1 percent profit and never has paid a dividend, you have to look at everything around you and prepare.. these are my sentiments others may differ.. you can use Elliot cycles, etc etc.. gut feel is best.
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:52:51
I doubt that
@_date: 2018-10-18 01:26:28
$4000 won’t hold at 6k
@_date: 2018-10-01 12:22:37
All time high 2 years, a reasonable jump again 1 Month
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:12:20
Ahh ok, yes a good listing will pump for sure.. it worked with Dogecoin as well, but this was only based on rumours...
@_date: 2018-10-05 04:24:28
People say hodling when they are 50% down you say holding when you buy in at the bottom.
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:25:14
Well that’s enough for a pump for sure.. but remember if BTC drops so does everything else regardless of news.
@_date: 2018-10-02 22:38:09
My T/A says the same thing but the question is, is it too high for moon?
That’s the question.. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:12:56
It’s a process, must always do this before a new bull..
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:26:32
Yes but when LTC it goes from $500 to $81 Aud, it ain’t going back for 5 years.
@_date: 2018-10-01 21:42:18
Yes this is very true thousands have been lost from Hitbtc, I don’t think it’s a proper exchange.. and has low security 
@_date: 2018-10-19 20:33:39
6 years 
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:58:10
Which direction do you think the chip faces?
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:07:18
Yes LTC looks way over sold, but it’s not really my cup of tea, may take some time to improve, needs a good sideways first.
@_date: 2018-10-14 11:55:19
Yep that’s me.. I hate it it’s addictive 
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:59:35
Well if we want to run in the stock market, which appears to have an effect on cryptos.. I would say you are correct.
@_date: 2018-10-05 02:15:06
use Poloniex next time, more reliable.
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:05:51
Think of a ping pong ball bouncing on a table. As gravity takes hold it then bounces off the table.
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:40:40
knowing Trump, the exact opposite will happen, lol.
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:33:25
Once memes like this are released btc is on a free fall so don’t worry folks you will be able to buy at wholesale again in a heartbeat 
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:54:14
No one is with him because there isn’t a dividend yield.
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:37:00
When lambo?
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:27:42
Looks like he’s pushing it off a cliff...
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:35:25
Try $3000?
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:39:52
If people make losses like they have and only a few get rich, I’d say it would be difficult for any crypto to reach that price.. time will tell, I’d like to think it were 
True however.
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:33:06
Try $2000, based on historical charts back in 2015 it won’t recover it will just keep going lower this time.. wish it wasn’t the case.
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:42:50
He’s right but as the market is now much larger recovery will also be quicker.. 
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:57:15
9k seems to be the ceiling for now.
@_date: 2019-02-02 04:25:55
Will it be another 411?
@_date: 2019-04-14 00:20:09
Classic, brings back memory’s
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:52:24
My bets get flagged on reddit so you will have to wait and see
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:25:17
It’s rubbish the most you can write off is 3k 
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:43:08
Well good on you for not investing much, many people have lost their houses.. 
only risk what you can afford to lose..!
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:58:44
Its like watching the size of the earth to the sun videos.. lol
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:10:56
Cheers 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:11:08
I hate to say it but I knew this was going to happen
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:51:57
It will be a slow tank and head further south below 2000
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:09:31
No I’m just me lol
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:48:18
By Xmas unfortunately it will be below 2000 and still dropping.
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:07:16
Probably because people are now realising that bitcoin doesn’t actually have any real value to it, it’s only based on people’s perception.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:21:49
No it’s the Elliot wave theory look into it 
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:41:24
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:08:01
Make a bet?
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:50:59
Well you can look at patterns but this certainly has no influence on new volume.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:42:57
Sometimes this is a blessing if it’s a dead cats bounce
@_date: 2019-01-18 22:59:44
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:39:38
Well you are not alone, my partner bought at 20k 17k 13k 9k and 5k aud, a very similar situation, but it’s all for a long term hold, she read your post and said she can relate to your position.
@_date: 2019-01-23 19:00:40
I’m sure most women prefer you to work for a living as well.
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:59:28
Yes similar to poker machines
@_date: 2019-01-11 05:45:44
Yes well I just hope my partner doesn’t keep spending our money on bitcoin, if she keeps buying at 4 k 3k 2 k 1 k then 500 then 10 dollars we won’t have any money left !
@_date: 2019-01-24 10:50:55
I wonder if anyone in this forum has used one of these ? If so is it a bit of a process?
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:34:37
Hodl and ride that baby down.
@_date: 2019-01-23 09:18:17
But 1 btc is 3500?
@_date: 2019-01-16 12:20:02
Can you use it at any ATM?
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:10:03
Ok I’d bet 1 bitcoin. As neither of us will know it’s value it won’t even be a reasonable bet.
@_date: 2019-01-19 13:34:34
Expect to be slave to old fucks for a long long time, they now die over 100 and they are fit and healthy hahaha, the new youth will have no money their entire lifetime lol too bad so sad.
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:52:38
Yes but maybe the banks are right ?
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:09:02
There’s an old song from split enz I remember it goes “history never repeats I tell myself before I go to sleep”... lol
@_date: 2019-01-19 13:27:10
The link says “sorry that page doesn’t exist”
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:40:13
Oh dear another conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:01:30
The past does not equal the future keep that in mind.
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:25:46
No that isn’t the case, the stock market gives us the opportunity to buy into companies that will share the profit with the community as you grow with them through dividend yields, a cryptos price movement is based purely on what one guy is willing to sell the next guy, due to a perceived value on a given day.
@_date: 2019-01-24 10:57:29
I’d say McAfee on his boat running away from the IRS would disagree.
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:28:16
I would say get the hell out of bitcoin all together if that’s the case
@_date: 2019-01-16 12:17:25
Lol good pick up 
@_date: 2018-07-26 07:13:16
Yes it is because this time it’s headed to 30k
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:11:34
It’s up and up, no more resistance levels.
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:17:11
Well the poop I own is bcn Bytecoin, 2 pumps in 6 months with a higher low tells me things will look Aok down the track..
@_date: 2018-07-17 03:50:43
And just remember the longer it moves sideways the higher it will go, like a spring loaded rocket.
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:03:27
And now it’s likely to drop 80% hang on for the ride everyone!
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:49:55
So true 5k has a laughable 
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:45:13
Nice approach buy and forget is the best answer for personal sanity
@_date: 2018-12-08 08:28:54
Awesome design, but this dip looks different to the tshirt.
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:09:08
Never say the word “finally” no one can predict the bottom.
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:55:38
Graphs don’t really indicate the future, we will have a global recession as well.
@_date: 2018-12-14 08:26:04
Both sides are a game of 2 up, up or down it still has risks, there have been people that shorted have lost the shirt off their back when a bull market arrived.. sad for them but true 
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:42:41
Well it depends if it goes to 1 dollar that can take 15 months of shorting.. no one knows where the bottom is that’s for sure.
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:21:23
I think you’ll find most hopes and dreams are with price and mining to come back again rather than spiral down.
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:11:40
Down forever means delisting which will never happen.
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:57:34
Eh did you consider bots that also sell?
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:38:48
Meanwhile people in the futures market are shorting bitcoin not actually buying it.. the price could just keep going down
@_date: 2018-12-16 05:12:59
Eh not sure if I’ll catch a knife with my balls lol
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:15:01
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:56:20
Wow, that’s deep man.. give me another toke.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:09:30
Like with anyone that has a gambling problem it is very unlikely you will get your money back, because once they win they gamble the lot and then lose it all.
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:56:54
Yes I never understood why a BTC sub keeps raving on about BCH, weird or what?
@_date: 2018-12-17 10:07:05
I guess it’s up to everyone to work out what “low” is, the next question to ask is it a “safe” trading range, it’s up to you to make that decision as no one can really give financial advice, where do we see blood on the streets ?
@_date: 2018-12-16 05:39:44
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:50:48
Hope is a 4 letter word.
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:52:40
Is that Craig? Or Satoshi?
@_date: 2018-12-16 20:19:30
Yes in around 36 months I’d say
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:04:56
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:11:56
Way lower with futures shorting 
@_date: 2018-12-31 22:40:15
Try $40 and further 
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:08:33
I’m having a beer now cheers and merry Xmas !
@_date: 2018-12-09 00:20:14
@_date: 2018-12-23 00:31:31
For this quantity it would have to be done in smaller increments.
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:46:56
@_date: 2018-12-22 11:38:58
Sideways down action for 12 months, so be careful.
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:51:31
It’s true to some degree as the resistance lines are many now, but after 36 months or so it should free up again.
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:03:53
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:31:06
Well said, yes people do need to understand supply and demand, if only they would just want to learn it.
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:41:33
So you can sell it cheaper? Lol
@_date: 2018-12-16 03:39:03
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:16:05
Not sure what this means? Is there a correlation between drunk people and bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:23:26
