Don't feel to bad. All my coins are still tied up in Mt gox.

I bought a $60 video game for around 112 BTC years back. Some years later  I lost all my bitcoins when MtGox went down. Don't worry about the things you can't change.

I have to say trying to buy a bitcoin has proven to be very frustrating. I have now opened accounts with BTC-e and MtGox along with A couple of other trading sites. I have also opened liberty reserve, OKPAY, Perfect Money ,LiqPay and a couple more accounts I have still not managed to buy one bit coin. I have also given my CC number to LiqPay and the only thing I got in response was an error message in Russian that made no sense. I have to say as a first time user I'm not impressed with bitcoin.

$3000 is to much for me. I wish they made something small for the little guy something in the $500 to $1000 range. 
@_date: 2013-01-16 02:20:55
Every time I try to use a CC on liqpay I get the following error.

Good luck with this. You have more of a chance of directly communicating with North Korea then you do with Google.

Looking at some of my minimum payout settings is making me wish I would have sat a little aside. The last pool I checked I had a minimum payout of 10 btc set, unfortunately only .02 left in the account.
