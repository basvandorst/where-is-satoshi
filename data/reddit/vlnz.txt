In the short term, there is no advantage in using any crypto for the average Joe, especially in the US of Oceania. That's why things are the way they are right now in general.
The average slavetard that Joe is, he has been thoroughly
brainwashed all his life that the current paradigm isn't broken; it just needs a few improvements to make it perfect. And "If it ain't broke..."
In the long term, I think we'll live to see the day this question is asked about fiat. 
At that point, those still clinging to fiat will be at a disadvantage.

I think you are OLD-thinking it, which is "normal".
If you dont want to be "required to trust anyone else with my money", yet you are "unprepared to have the onus of securing money", then I think you are not ready to mess with crypto yet, which is ok. Just learn about it for now.
With freedom, come dangers and responsibilities to fend for yourself; just ask any free animal. (We live in a kind of a large zoo, with ever-shrinking cages...)
The current system keeps it "simple and clean" for you. So, just stick with that, until you are comfortable with storing your own bitcoins. It won't be all your resources anywhay.

They will know the truth of the situation, rather than the r/bitcoin pump hype: as usual a middleman called Bitpay accepts bitcoins.
My bet is that MasterCard knows better than we do that the Small &amp; Limp goliath doesn't have a single bitcoin among its official company assets, because it really only accepts that good ol' "worthless fiat", which Mastercard moves.

13 of the 100 poorest places in the US with population &gt; 1000 are in the Carolinas. 
9 of the them are in North Carolina.
The 7th poorest place in all of the US - Yanceyville, NC - is only 66 miles from Raleigh, NC.
It has the median HOUSEHOLD income of ~14,000 PER YEAR! Compared to 53,000 median household income for the US as a whole.
So, an average good ol' boy in Yanceyville, who wants to attend the CryptoCarolina expo, to learn how he can free himself from the tyranny of the banksters and powers that should not be, would have to fork out ~2% of his !ANNUAL FAMILY! income to do that! That's just for the ticket! :^D

They were offered bitcoin more than 3 years now, and always turned up their nose at it, as something not worth their time and trouble.

I would like to help provide liquidity, but I agree with those here who say that BTC/VEF trade is unviable and pointless for most of us. 
It would be hard to profit, and the risk is great that whatever we put in would disappear due to government action or the exchange goxing us...
Do you think something like TEM that exists in Greece, but based on btc would work? I mean where a bunch of people and businesses agree to use btc without converting it to fiat.
If VEF is so hopeless, seems that something like TEM would be better than nothing.

Since the the government can only get bitcoin through their usual coercion, I think they will never really sell whatever Bitcoins they can steal.

Yes, by the "current system", I meant the banksters.
If you are not ready to take the crypto risks, there is the traditional, now very undervalued physical commodities method - gold, silver, diamonds, etc.

MtGox will be relevant for years, because the average slavetard in the world thinks that Bitcoin ended with Gox as a giant ponzi bubble.
So now, the sheeple will be even more distrustful of any cryptocurrency for a long time. The government and banking astroturf will also help them stay that way, until the powers that should not be load up as much as possible with bitcoin and anything else that might be valuable.
Karpeles did an epic amount of harm to everyone in the crypto space, even those like me, who didn't lose any money in its final collapse.

In the early days of Bitcoin, when the first map of bitcoin nodes appeared, there was a mining node persistently showing square in the middle of the Kremlin.
You can see the Russians mention it on bitcointalk back then, when bitcoin was less than 1USD:
So, the Russian govmnt, probably has at least as many bitcoins as the US govmnt does...
However, it is a dictatorship, which would not benefit from their fiat being devalued even a tiny bit, by what they call "surrogate" payments.
If they don't listen to the head of their government bank, (Sberbank) German Gref, who spoke against banning Bitcoin, nothing we or the Russian pions say in the comment period will make the slightest bit of difference:
As the last presidential "election" in Russia showed, public opinion on anything matters even less there than in the US.

With all the bitcons they were offered in the early years, Wikimedia could have funded itself until the end of times.

I am surprised this is even a topic; the main reason Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle and such are allowed to exist is because they are going to allow the fascists that run your country to have surveillance on the flow into and out of the Bitcoin system.
To do that, naturally, they want to force anyone who in any way interacts with those surveillance choke points to voluntarily enter themselves into that database.

To me on this question, what matters is not whether or not the NSA can break or has back-doored Bitcoin.
If Satoshi was an NSA employee, it means IF Bitcoin continues to progress and dominate in the cryptocurrency future, that the NSA will be the wealthiest entity ever. AND so will be the ArmedGang.gov.us, which is its parent crime group.
That means endless resources for the status-quo - endless war, government bigger than ever, too-big-to-fail^10, etcetera. AND if another cryptocurrency starts becoming dominant, the NSA will simply buy the biggest stake in that, and continue as they would with Bitcoin.
What happens to the NSA and its sister gestapos as cryptocurrency gains momentum, might be the best indication of who Satoshi is.

The rate is only set by the global market if the supply and demand are balanced. If the demand was higher than supply in Russia, the rate against RUR would reflect in those metrics no matter what the global USD driven rate is.
The point is that there is nothing significant going on in the Russian retail btc market. The increase in volume without an increase in rate, just confirms how much of an oversupply of bitcoin exists right now for the current demand.
There is such a glut and dumping of bitcoins on the market by miners, merchants, and thieves, such as the US Marshals, that even a fiat crisis in a major world economy doesn't move the rate metrics.

From what the OP told us, to me it seems more likely that the OP has a RAT on his Iphone, than a vulnerability at LB. There are hundreds of experienced traders continuing to trade on LB right now. Yet, we are not hearing of them being “robbed” through the same vulnerability at LB.
If it is an  LB vulnerability, it is also “speculation” that LB is or isn't doing “something” about it.
A number of details of this case don't make sense to me yet. The OP decided to make his first use of Bitcoin to move a sum that is significant for most of us, even in the 1st world.
He “purchased” bitcoins somewhere and moved them to BlockChain. (So, it was really his 2nd time using Bitcoin to move them to LB.) AFAIK, BlockChain doesn't sell bitcoins, or did I miss some change they made?
Hushmail is a centralized email host, from which the thief contacted the OP. It is known to cooperate fully with the US and other gestapos in “criminal” investigations. Yet, it didn't occur to him to contact them for help in tracking down this thief?
It's also unclear at this point, what is the “something” that you think LB should do, considering that the bitcoins were stolen by someone logging in from a tor node.
 If they block TOR, the bitcoins would have been just as hopelessly gone if the attack came from a public hotspot somewhere in Bumfukistan, as shown by "centralized bank" cracks.
LB can't determine that the OP didn't rob himself for the sake of monetary gain or some other agenda.

| Thanks for your opinion! Why do you believe all derivatives are scams?
Because they are tools for subverting the free market price discovery of the underlying asset. 
Right now, all major currencies are in QE mode, yet the price of gold and other PM's is going down through use of derivatives.
The 2008 events were pretty convincing to me that derivatives are a criminal scam.
So, if to me derivatives in the traditional money(metals) and the source of all wealth (REAL estate) are clearly scams to subvert free markets for the benefit of those who issue them, I am pretty sure that all other derivatives are scams...

I dealt with 2 this year to set up a trust - young, sharp people, around 30.
Later needed help from another one in a different firm with my business - a woman about the same age, also very competent. 
All sent  me the drafts over regular email, with all the personal details, etc.
When I mentioned PGP, Ostel, SpiderOak, etc, it was like I was talking rocket science to them.
I offered to help answer any questions. They said they would check into setting that up. Haven't heard from them since, and bet they still do it all in the open.
The other firm, can send files through some kind of a private website, but all email and phone comm is on open lines.
They don't even advertise private communications as a service, because they just don't consider privacy of electronic communications to be necessary.

I think if you look at other indicators, there is nothing to celebrate yet:
For a country of 140mil, 70-80 B a day is nothing. OBV is neg, RSI centered, Momentum below 0, rate looks completely USD driven. 
So, looks like for retail buyers, there is oversupply there also. BTC-e, where pro traders are, looks better, but not much:
Makes sense: for now btc is even more risky and less stable than the ruble. 
It's not something common people would run for in a fiat crisis, especially the Russians, who lived through this in recent times.
I bet besides consumables, they are mostly buying USD and Euros.
If USD was crashing like this, I bet most in the US wouldn't be buying Bitcoins either.

Speaking as a bitcoin layman, this seems like a debate about who should be a "plug-in" for whom.
Ethereum is 5 years behind Bitcoin, not even released yet, and Bitcoin sidechains were contemplated years ago.
So, it seems to me pretty arrogant and self-aggrandizing of Vitalik et al to declare Bitcoins limitations, and rather than helping to surmount them to pull so much development power to "provide pretty much everything, while being almost nothing".
Pretty typical of what i've noticed in the Open-Source development world though: someone comes up with a good idea, and starts to develop it. Other devs, rather than helping to perfect it as fast as possible, splinter off to reinvent the same wheel - mostly just so that they can be chiefs of their own fiefdom, rather than collaborators on the original team. As the result, nothing gets developed as quickly or as well as it could be.
In this case, there is also the added financial incentive of awarding yourself something for being the Ethereum Satoshi...
I think it would be far more useful if the massive world of open-source development power focused on perfecting and improving Bitcoin through sidechains and otherwise, rather than coming out with more and more altcoins and metacoins.
Ethereum's hyrbrid initial distribution smells bad to me also.
So, I am against the current "silo development", and hope all the altcoins eventually side-chain to Bitcoin through pegging, or disappear. I won't buy or support any more of the altcoin circus, including Ether.

If you've ever dealt in a course of business with an organized crime group running a protection racket, you already heard a similar, more concise version of this speech.
They also told you that they want to first and foremost protect you and everyone else in “their area” from “criminals”, which “don't play by their rules”.
They also explained to you how they will give you a lower “protection” cost rate, while you are starting up, in order to make it easier for your business to succeed.
You can even get custom rules, by “special arrangement and extra fee”...
The details of the charade are a little different when dealing with an armed gang called “the government”, but one thing is exactly the same: the rules they set for you are compulsory.
Any transgression on your part, will be judged by members of that very same local armed gang, or its parent group, for whose “protection and services” your “fees” will pay...
After millennia of different government systems, even the most benevolent and “democratic” ones are still just the strongest armed gang in your area, running a bigger and better version of the millennia-old obligatory “protection” racket.

It's not my "assertion"; it's the facts for the Carolinas:
From those facts, what put the Carolinas "behind the tech revolution" are lower than average high school and college graduation rates, which still exist. And that's NOT because people here are particularly stupid, or don't want education...
(If you want to bring up history of agriculture, that only makes my point that the population as a whole is rather poor: only 5-6 generations ago, most of the Carolinas' population were slaves.  Then it became subsistance farmers.
Today, the population spends the same as the rest of the country at retail level, yet has significantly less disposable income on average.)

Do you really believe the financial and legal departments at these giant companies can't figure out how to accept bitcoins directly legally, and calculate cost-basis?! We can!
They are playing you like a cheap violin, with the help of propaganda from self-serving middlemen like BitPay, Coinbase, and such!
Where were the calls in this circle-jerk for “evidence”, “proof or it didn't happen”  that &gt;50% of Bitpay merchants don't immediately convert their bitcoins to fiat?!
Where was the thread blasting Coinbase for declining to disclose anything about that?!

More broadly, regardless of what happened in this case, I think that things like LocalBitcoins and LocalTrader are the most decentralized, worldwide trading systems Bitcoin has so far. 
For every 3-letter gestapo, regulator, bank and armedGang.gov, they are some of the least controllable, least Spy-On-Your-Customer, and least Anti-Privacy, because they bypass the banking choke points like ConBase, BitPay, Circle, etc.  
So, LB and the like are the most threatening to the status-quo ponzi system run by "centralized banks" and UnitedCoersionServices.gov...
So, whether or not the OP was robbed or there is a vulnerability at LB, I think we'll see more and more astroturf and sock puppets of the InternalLootingService.gov, JPPonzi.bank and ViolenceUnlimited.gov on the Internet about "first-time" Bitcoin users being mysteriously robbed.

They would go away, only if BTC adopted their privacy tech, which it won't, because it's added risk, and the Big-Brother bitcoiners will lobby against that now.

My point is that the fact that they are even allowed to operate in the US makes them a database of Bitcoin users and transaction the government can access with a stroke of pen, any time they want, and no one will have any evidence of that, except "them".
If you are too blind to understand that nowdays, after all the evidence of omnipresent US government surveillance with much greater and much lesser things than Bitcoin, than you just keep waiting for your evidence. They make gag orders to dupe evidence-based slavetards like you. 
The same lame logic of yours was essential to cover up CIA torture, blanket NSA spying, civil forfeiture, and a myriad of other such government crimes, because "no evidence". The blindest always wait for the latest Snowden, to show them what was already easy to deduce.

What some also think happens is that during these downturns some who have enough fiat and understand Bitcoin's potential, post "divesting" doom and gloom to drive the rate as low as possible.
Then they "invest" in it again, rinse and repeat. The OP could really be one of the oldest tricks in the trading world...

There was a report from an established Kuwait investment banking firm - Markaz - to use Bitcoin in oil trade:

That's right, if you mess with fiat the way OP is proposing, because then one has to mess not only with fiat middlemen, but also the crypto middlemen...
If OP gets paid in crypto, and pays in crypto, there might be some savings.

Yeah, keep begging for big merchants to "accept Bitcoin" by dumping it on the markets for fiat through middlemen like Bitpay, Coinbase, etc.
The exchange rate show how much good that's doing for "Bitcoin adoption".

It's not at all clear from the chart that some Russians are turning to btc to hedge against the Ruble. They would be crazy to do that, because the btc is down more than 40% against the Ruble.
Btc has been in a perpetual freefall for a year, and there is no indication for now that it will break the trend.
I think it's just some speculators creating this volume. And the reason might as well be a myriad of other reasons, besides Ruble hedging.
My point is that a rise from insignificant to  3 * insignificant is not "volume rises dramatically". This kind of threads is the reason this subredit is gaining a bad reputation as quickly as it's gaining new subscribers.

Actually, the "fascist hell" is already here; he just doesn't want it to go away.
Look at the definition of fascism in the Wikipedia, and you quickly see that every government currently in existence, including in the United States of Oceania, is some form of fascism or worse.

I think the "killer app" is simply when anyone can get paid in Bitcoin.
 Right now, even merchants who "accept Bitcoin", actually get paid in fiat.
I want to get paid for work in Bitcoin, but i can't find any way to do that yet.
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:34:42
Right. It's about treating Bitcoin like chopped liver for years, and turning down donations through it.
So, since they are continuing to treat it as something less  than the other payments even once the accept it, they don't deserve or need any benefits of Bitcoin now either.
What goes around, comes around. May that be so for all of us.

I am glad I had enough sense to leave Gox before it crashed, and don't have much sympathy for those who ignored the cacophony of warnings and warning signs...
However, Karpeles screwed a lot of people out of a lot of money, especially in the Bitcoinica disaster.
I hope he doesn't get to enjoy any of the money he is getting now, after this charade of "legal justice" is over.
I hope the people who made all kinds of threats against Karpeles actually carry them out, and are just waiting for the final word from our legal "protectors".
What goes around, should always come around!

It doesn't matter if they do or not, imho. 
The important thing is that a loop is established:
OS takes btc payments for its services
OS makes btc payments for its employees' services.
Wish other merchants would do that; just taking btc payments and converting them to fiat mostly benefits middlemen, such as payment processors and exchangers. Doesn't do much for Bitcoin as a whole at this stage.

It would not have made a difference in this case, but it seems safest not to fund one's  LB account with btc, until right before the meeting is set up.
Seems like a lot of people just use it to arrange FTF deals, and then just do the exchange FTF, without sending btc through LB. 
That seems the safest way, even with the danger of an FTF hold-up. If you do FTF in a public place, with your car close by, even the danger of that is minimized.

Worse than that: check with your lawyer or accountant, and ask them if you can start communicating with them and sending paperwork through encrypted means!
If they don't shit their pants and dump you as some kind of criminal or terrorist, they will just look at you funny, and politely decline.

I think it's because of the Ethereum sale. 
That group is selling for fiat, as speculators are diverting bitcoin there.

I think they could probably figure out a bitcoin discount on door-buster items, on which they might take a loss anyway.
They might also be able to come up with some kind of a bitcoin coupon on certain items.
However, I think they want to implement their own payment system, which will be more profitable than messing with crypto.
I think the retailers to approach with such proposals are things like Dollar General, because I think they want to out-innovate and replace Walmart, the way it did Sears and K-Mart. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 15:16:28
more importantly, if employers would pay in bitcoin. Most people have a job, and most merchants just convert bitcoin to fiat.

That was banks all over the world. It's still uncertain how much the Fed pilfered USD holders to prop up non-US banks, by "injecting liquidity" into them out of nothing...
Notice how they are talking about global finance, rather than just the financial giant - Canada, and its massive system of 59 banks.

I think DarkWallet was the first indiegogo campaign to accept Bitcoin.

That always goes without saying, and none of us here know the true reason why the Russians haven't tried that. Russian "private interests" that have enough HP to affect that decision, have at least as much access to large sums of Rubles as USD. 
So, they have little to lose, particularly if their USD holdings overseas are being "sanctioned" already anyway.
In any case, it's doubtful that the western European states of the US empire could just as easily and cheaply find a comparable supply of gas and oil for Euro and USD, if Russia demanded Ruble or RMB, or what have you, as payment for theirs.

Yes, and there are thousands of examples of things that have merits, yet are not really valued, much less have "a real future".
So your merits sticking exercise is also worthless on its own.
Track record matters just as much if not more than merits of the thing.

Try these:
Safest way I know is to create an Electrum multisig with one of them above as the escrow facilitator:
So, in an escrow case using a third party, it would be a 2 of 3 setup, with one of the above being the deciding release key in case of a dispute between you and your counterparty. 
You could do 2 of 2 setup without a third party and their fees, but then you and your counterparty will have to resolve any dispute between yourselves.

My major objection to investing in anything on BnkToTheFuture is that Max Kaiser is behind it.
Wasn't he the pump and dumper behind MaxCoin also?

That wasn't my question: since Kaiser was behind the MaxCoin pump and dump, what kind of "sweetener" is there going to be against Max Kaiser turning the Bitcoin Capital into a pump and dump? :)

I haven't used it, and love localbitcoins.com, where you can make all kinds of deal, including PP, but you might try  or
If you do, please update us how it went. 
I personally would not sell for PP for reasons already mentioned.

I like Electrum wallet, because it's so fast to load and sync, and is portable, and doesn't need to download the block chain, and has that whole hierarchical structure business.
On the Android, my favorite is Mycelium, because you can use cold wallets with it, it loads fast also, and is easy to work.

I see some people on LocalBitcoins.com trading for gift cards instead of cash. 
You can buy them at any supermarket, and just trade BTC for the cards from the stores you usually shop, gas stations where you refuel, etc.
Seems to be the way to do it, and promote btc use in the real economy, rather than just exchange speculation.
@_date: 2013-07-20 19:42:45
Is LocalBitcoins.com not available where you are?
I've seen all kinds of local deposit deals there, but I prefer trading for gift cards and such, which works great!
The whole Bitinstant thing is a mess and a rip-off, imho.
