I may be missing the point here, but isn't the point if bitcoin to keep government out? To get government out of our pockets and out of the financial system?

I love this argument against bitcoin.  If only all other currencies would be held to the same standard.
The US dollar is never used to buy illegal things!

It may not have been a selling point, but everyone knows how to rid yourself of a paper trail in a business transaction...pay in cash!
In terms of the labor market, you get the phrase "Under the table"...People who get paid "under the table"....guess what they are paid in....
4 letter word, starts with C, rhymes with ASH.

The government wants its slimy hands in everyone's cookie jars.

I would also like to know of any services that allow payment with debit cards.
I don't like the idea of having to send checks or money orders.

I'm not to sure this is a good thing vs a bad thing.
If its declared a currency, they'll just try to take it down like they did with the "Liberty Dollar", claiming counterfeit.

I know I've already commented on this article, but it just really bugs me.
The government should stay out of Bitcoin.
I see no possible way to do such a thing.  Its like making a law to stop the rain.  It won't work.
The decentralized nature of Bitcoin, it's anonymity and the ability to have transactions through TOR would make this an impossible endeavor for the government.
It would be throwing money down a blackhole...Much like the Drug war and the War on terror.
Regulations on Bitcoin will not be enforceable.  It will all be a huge waste of money.

If you think ATM fees are robbery, you probably think rent is theft too.
Fuck outta here with that commie bullshit!

This isn't robbery though.
You are paying for convenience.

I use my checking account.
Why is credit instant but checking not?  That's strange because they debited my account almost instantly.

I don't know, there is so much. Are you the only person who does this? How much is Bitcoin being adopted there? Is it growing fast? What about gold?
I love hearing anything on this! Anything! :)

This makes sense.  Thanks.

What is double spending?  Anyone care to ELI5?

Bitcoin killed PC gaming.
