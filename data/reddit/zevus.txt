it was the same way prior to when i turned off my bitcoind node, re: being 4x or so above the next IP.  my log cuts off on November 28th at 22:00 GMT.  I decided it was a waste of time since, 1) asics were not and still are not worth buying and 2) I got tired of people accusing me of stealing bitcoins due to my IP appearing as the ''originator'' of x transaction.  they probably won't be up much longer, i just wanted to see what sort of movement (if any) I could cause at the chart at   i guess it's fairly conclusive if you also check the action that occurred on the 28th and afterwards (was up 22 hours on the 28th, then not at all).
5.9.24.81 used to get hordes of blocks until it was designated as "Deepbit".  All the blocks showing as 'Deepbit' may as well be "unknowns" just like the ones from 76.72.171.85 and 4.30.110.165.
and I just put that stuff up like two hours ago *boggle*

i'm not so sure about that.  i mean, you'd have to go pretty deep down the reseller chain.  people still pay absurd amounts for these contracts, so the people selling them are still making money.
are the people buying them for the sole purpose of reselling?  i still wouldn't agree that it fits the definition of a ponzi.  more like mass stupidity.

Just took them offline now.  Just wanted to test that, really...  I'll be waiting until people stop paying 5-10x value for ASICs before getting back into bitcoins (never?). 
That 4.30.110.165 address was only 100mbit and after a new block hit the network, it'd cap out at 12MB/s for a good 20 seconds or so (I was thinking there may be a problem w/ nodes continuing to DL from a slow connection instead of looking for another source, but didn't look at the code)... so I replaced that yesterday with another machine on 76.72.171.xx network and decided to test # of connections...  6 months ago, I had best success with 400-600 connections, now it seems it's OK to have 800 or 900.  Blockchain still thinks you're the first to get everything, etc.
Here's a good example of the burst on that Database by Design node I had running with some godawful # of connections:

@_date: 2015-07-07 11:27:00
At least as of 10 hours ago, about 95% of my rejects were because of dust....  about 4% because of rate limit or zero fee, 1% misc. I suppose.
The same pools that built off of the 'wrong' blocks, also include the dust transactions in their blocks; btcchina pool for example...  the others, they'll not include these, so 'legit' transactions shouldn't have much wait time

the base client rejects the vast majority of these transactions being included in some of these blocks, as dust transactions
the real issue here is that  in base client the tx mem pool is 'unlimited', and these 20-30% of nodes that accept these dust transactions cause bandwidth and cpu usage to skyrocket, as they keep trying to send them over and over.

Those all show as 2015-07-06 18:36:37 because that's when BTCChina broadcast its block.  there are 43 pages of those transactions,  they  wouldn't be relayed by the base client

Intel Core i7-3770, 2x3TB HDD, gigabit port.  Two common variants to that, one with 16GB of RAM and one with 32GB RAM (and further, for the 16GB RAM version, you'd want to go with one with 2x8GB sticks instead of 4x4GB sticks if possible).
The 32GB RAM variant is roughly $31 right now, but they frequently hit $30.  The 16GB variant is at $27.65.
There's an i7-2600 w/ 16GB of RAM and 2x3TB HDD's at $25.75, but that's the price point they tend to get bought at.  You'll see another one at the next step up with a few hours remaining until dropping, probably.
@_date: 2015-03-26 02:00:14
It's because the netherlands is a major hub, and therefore has cheap bandwidth.
situation is similar in france and germany, and parts of the US (buffalo (NY), dallas, chicago, seattle, etc)
if China had i7-3770's, w/ 32GB of RAM and 2x3TB HDD's with burst speed up to 100MB/s on a 1gbit port for $30/mo, I'd buy from there

But, yeah, most people I knew started offloading all their equipment at around $4-$5 at bargain bin prices.

That's surprising, given how many of those $1 USB things they were selling for $100 (yes, I know ASICs have a high initial R&amp;D cost)..
One would think once they got over that hurdle, they'd be fine, though.   The one I'm thinking about inparticular is 'ASICMiner'...

If you don't have to pay VAT, you can grab a Hetzner dedicated server for under $20;
  (my listings page, w/o VAT)
18.49 euro is, ah, $19.99 right now at current exchange rate.  Euro has gone up a bit lately, though.
Personally I'd spring for the Intel Core i7-3770, 2x3TB, 16GB RAM for €24.37, but if it must be under $20 ...
(as for linode and the 40GB plan, I think if you used custom partitioning you could free up a couple hundred MB)
@_date: 2015-03-19 11:19:30
It doesn't come close to offsetting the cost.
Even if you were budget conscious and didn't blow your money on Digital Ocean or Linode.
I could buy a hundred of these $18/yr "Lightning 1024", 1GB RAM, 1GB vSwap, 2 vCPU, 50GB SSD, 1TB, 1Gbps port from Ramnode, still wouldn't make my money back.
Anyway, if you're determined to run a node, then at least spend your money wisely,

The 36AYEAR has 2GB RAM, 2 CPU, 200GB SSD, 2 TB bandwidth limit, and 1Gbps port.  Wouldn't be too shocked if it had better network performance than DO, either .. at least when you pay so much for Linode, you get quality peering

Before I took the noglegs down, they were doing over 5TB of upstream a month.  There's a couple of problems with that, 1) some people have bandwidth caps, 2) most home connections (at least here in the US) aren't even capable of sending, say, 6-8TB upstream in a month, even if they fully saturate it

Why don't you re-read your very first message to me, take a deep breath, then ask yourself if YOU would reply to such rubbish.
I guess you and this other separate person just don't understand how things works.  Here's a hint:  don't accuse me based off of IP relay information on blockchain.info.  The whole godaddy, hidden registrar, and police accessing my informations was just, well... absurd.   Though, tbh, I did get a few chuckles out of it &amp; forwarded it to a handful or so of people.
Would I be pissed if I had 22 coins stolen?  Sure.  Would I go around throwing out baseless accusations and spit out inane drivel like the above?  no.

I have to reply to this since it's just so damn hilarious.
Here are the messages I've gotten from Dessy on bitcointalk:
Hello, now that I've got an account and can PM I'd like to discuss the matter which you've been aware of since you stole my BTC. I've been on the phone to police and Interpol are going to phone on Monday morning to discuss what action I would like to take. If you return my bitcoins obviously there will be no problem. 
My reply, "Right."
So you're trying to tell me it wasn't you? Do you think I'm speaking shit? What's the deal here?
(less than an hour later, a second message from Dessy)
A quick follow up:
I see godaddy have hidden the registrar for your domain, however I'm sure the police will easily be able to gain access to that. In addition I am personally trawling your message history and will be forwarding all information I can find to the police tomorrow if my coins are not returned. 
Although I don't have any hard proof, and you know that, your response is very suspicious. If it wasn't you that took my coins, why reply with just "Right"? Why not ask what I'm on about, you don't know anything about missing bitcoins. You're not doing yourself any favours here.
My reply this time, "Oh, FFS, fuck off.  You have no clue what the hell you're talking about."
Dessy's fancy reply:
You might be right. I may have had a bit too much to drink tonight. But trust me, I have plenty of contacts that will find you and get my BTC back to me. I imagine you're watching my thread on reddit right now, quivvering, waiting for your door to be smashed in. We'll see who has the last laugh in due time.
... and now I peruse reddit and find this crap.
Hi.  Just because blockchain.info happens to show an IP address that belongs to me does not mean that I initiated this transaction.
If it did, I would have a very large amount of monies!
I've made no attempt to hide my identity.  I'm surprised you can't track me down yourself.  Maybe ask the tech savvy friend of yours for some infos?
At first I thought this was some lame phishing attempt so I reported your messages to the admins.  It took a while to realize you were actually being srs.  GMAFB. 
Sorry that you had a key logger on your computer from visiting pr0n sites?  What else can I say?
Oh, before you go asking some random friend of yours to bust down doors here in Texas you should probably read the Texas Penal Code... or more specifically, Sec. 9.31 and 9.32.
