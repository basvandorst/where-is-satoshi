I may be wrong as it has been awhile since my last Chemistry lab but couldn't one submerge the gold bar in water and measure the density of the bar (since the mass is known) and compare it to the known density of Au?

Edit: saw your reply later in the comments thread that the masses and specific gravities of Au and Tungsten are too close for this to work.

To play devil's advocate for a second, a bitcoin wallet takes some setting up as well.

Yeah...everyone should aim to do that.

look real close at your next dumps and you might find some Au

Water displacement would be a way to measure the volume of the object and you're right in that both the soccer ball and the Au soccer ball would have the same volume. 
Density = mass/volume, and the gold soccer ball would be quite heavier than the regular soccer ball. The specific density of elemental gold is a known quantity so if the density of the gold soccer ball matches up (or is very, very close) to the known density of Au then one can be assured that they are dealing with pure gold or be able to ascertain what purity their gold soccer ball is.
The known density of Au is ~19.3 g/cm3, grams being the units of mass and cm^3 the units of volume.

Hope this helps.
