Lightning isn't settlement. No one else knows if you're good for the money.
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:36:59
It's not BTC
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:45:18
Security? That's cryptographic. Decentralization? That's a diversity of miners, pools, who can afford tiny withdrawal fees.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:50:28
Bold lie.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:20:36
It's not Bitcoin if it's not settled. At 10 tps, I wouldn't hold your breath.
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:52:25
Watch me get banned: 
I want big blocks, I cannot lie. These Blockstream shills can't deny.
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:25:25
Yikes, there's a saying that "cash is king" because it's instantly fully settled.
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:49:19
NO2Xers, like Adam Back.
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:48:25
Censoring a majority opinion is pretty shitty.
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:12:20
Ad hominem - the market gets to decide which money is better now.
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:29:43
There doesn't seem to be anything here.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:23:27
BCH continues the original Bitcoin project. It's deceptive not to state that.
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:21:27
When you need to move BTC the most, everyone else will need to move too. Failure state.
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:27:42
Not when you need it most - then you'll be waiting for settlement in the mempool.
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:18:46
When you really need it, is the same time that all other BTCers will need it.
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:06:42
Safe answer in dangerous waters.
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:35:15
Don't mention Roger Ver!
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:56:29
Don't mention bcash.
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:23:29
Can't spend it with anyone else immediately, gets backlogged at 10 tps. Takes a hot wallet. No thanks.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:48:22
Trash response without substance. It's not decentralized if there's one implementation, one option for scaling.
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:15:55
IMHO, value is what someone is willing to pay for it. Digging a ditch isn't useful, despite it being time consuming.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:03:17
Don't draw attention to the not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:14:09
They spam the network and support non-bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:11:33
Bitcoin has worked for 9 years, and is running with low fees as intended elsewhere. It's the lack of settlement that prevents me from risking my bitcoin in a lightning hot-wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:44:23
It was intentional - let BCH be adopted, and pull the rug out from under BTC2X.
@_date: 2018-05-21 05:34:09
So much for uncensorable, eh?
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:46:16
Crap article, read Vitalik's response.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:43:10
SegWit was a cancerous "solution" that tricked Bitcoiners. Bigger blocks has long been a censored topic in these forums and others under the control of TPTB.
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:36:40
People ought to do useful things for others. Useless things are a waste of resources, and I won't subsidize them.
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:49:39
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:51:30
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:27:40
If fees are high to support miners beyond the reward, and Lightning is only made for less risky, hot wallet-sized transactions, how can Lightning settle economically?
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:47:49
Small blocks == high fees. That's the intent. Small miners have no way to eek by with a profit - so BTC will centralize mining.
No so with BCH.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:19:18
Keep that message up, and all adoption will be spam.
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:14:53
Users who can be misled into supporting a cheaper fork.
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:19:52
I'm steel-manning the 1MB block argument. In blockchain, the only truth is what everyone else knows for certain. So it's not cash until it's settled to the blockchain.
What could happen if one million lightning-bitcoins needed to settle at the same time, because of a vulnerability in lightning hot-wallets...
@_date: 2018-05-21 05:34:55
Immediately and completely useless upon the invention of Lightning.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:35:33
Nah, I know that bigblocks work, and it's economical. Can't put the genie back in the bottle now.
LN isn't settlement. No one can know the states of all channels - and double spending will happen.
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:17:27
The only truth in blockchain is what everyone else knows for sure. In Lightning, no one else knows, until you settle to the blockchain.

"Inflation throughout the 20th century made centavos essentially worthless by its end, with fractional value coins with values such as 0$50 and 2$50 eventually withdrawn from circulation in the 1990s. With the entry of Portugal in the Eurozone, the conversion rate to the euro was set at 200$482 to €1.[5]
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:25:32
BTC can fix it! Wait, 7 tx/s with SegWit and no LN...
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:16:57
This response to inflation is so weird. "Money that I couldn't access inflated the same amount". What about salaries, with sticky prices? Contracts? 
@_date: 2018-06-01 06:12:52
Under what conditions would you support a blocksize increase?
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:06:30
You don't trust them, you verify them. SPV wallets download the block headers, and the transactions, and check that they are in the block's merkle tree.
My take is that on-chain transactions will become too expensive for an individual, and BTC's take is that full nodes will become too expensive for an individual. However, using the Lightning Network requires running a full node, and using the Lightning Network requires 100MB+ blocks...

Bitcoin Core creates the reference implementation of Bitcoin Core. Anything else is out of spec.
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:29:32
Who's the 3rd party? Not miners.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:57:19
Bitcoin is an idea, Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation for BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:19:50
This is my experience too.
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:28:53
Peer to peer refers to the digital signature. Unlock OTX, assign to ITX.
Miners can't modify the cryptography of the blockchain - they just earn bitcoins by winning the block lottery.
