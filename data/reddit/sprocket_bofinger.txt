Use that donation and buy toys for the sick kids at the children's hospital even a ps2 can keep them occupied while they wait to die. No seriously whole wards filled with terminal kids.
I'm sorry for interrupting your generosity. Peace, love, respect, stay strong brother!

Hard to buy in when even the atm machines rip you off.
I really like to see how 3344.47 USD+ 8% = 4800 CAD.
Not like there's anything else to buy except Hodling.

Just googled btc in toasters and some stuff popped up:
"Meet the company that wants to put a bitcoin miner in your toaster | FT ..."
Just take apart the toaster, you have nothing to lose except time and a 5 dollar toaster.

* Satoshi mines
* Gambling sites
* BTC doublers
* Hyip sites
* Problematic exchanges
* Hackers
* 236 billion wallets
* cloud mining
* ETC
Honestly other than for the money...I've yet to see anything good from BTC (and the crypto market) except the donation sites and physical miners and maybe contract tokens, possibly new communities.
Probably be easier to open up portfolios and wallets for your moms friends and make them sign a disclosure and print them out quarterly's. You could take suburbia by storm. (lol don't, I'm just talking out of my ass).

This guy knows it. Crypto-newb here and that was the first thing that ran thru my head was WTF do they want a stool sample too?
I use a ATM and pay the 4-12% and that's it, no need for passport photos no need for bank statements etc.
Don't get me wrong ATM fees are bogus, but at least I'm not dropping my info into some exchanges that might not even stick around.
Shady people 7 years ago were able to function without the need of passport photos lol.

Look man. Are you prepared to wake up the next day to a total loss of your UNI loans?
I don't mean dips. I'm talking about scams, theft, phishing links, lost passwords ETC.
