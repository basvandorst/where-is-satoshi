I think no one should deem a medium of exchange legal or not, and this should apply to many more things: drugs, people, dress code, patents..... Don't like it as an individual? Don't part take, but don't make this decision for others, solemnly on the premise that majority knows  best. Legal is a dumb notion as well what is legal in one state might be illegal in another what is illegal today might be legal in a year, it is purely subjective thing to deem something legal vs illegal in majority of circumstances. If you want to build an argument on "legality" of Bitcoin you are doomed to fail.

If you want to just argue from visa vs btc standpoint without touching all the other benefits of btc, on good reason I personally prefer btc is b/c if someone wants to find out where or how is my btc spent it is on them to do all the work I can simply refuse to provide the information hence financial freedom where as when I deal with a bank/visa they will release that info to 3rd parties without me even knowing. Another reason might be that visas system doesn't take that much resources to operate most of their resources is used on maintaining/increasing market shares, salaries/bonuses for ceo's I choose to opt out and rather fund miners that actually provide something more than smokes and mirrors. But in all the reality on chain btc payments aren't that good of an alternative to current cc system it is the proposition of btc being hard money that is so ground breaking. Of course second layer will crush visa once it is properly implemented but that's future....

No need for personal attacks like this he just wanted to let you know that you are simplifying a much more complex ideas, for example there is a lot of smart people out there who due to social programs (socialism on your chart) managed to get thru college and are contributing back to society much more than they otherwise would, there are ppl that of course also manipulate the system and waste tax dollars but as I stated before it is not that simple. So yeah a couple of arrows dont even come close to give the whole situation justice.

But at least I know it proves nothing it's just a "personal story" but you seem to know everything even what would have happened if some variables we're changed, and ppl like you is what keeps me worried you don't even realize how complex the system is, changing one variable has many more consequences than you think.

Ever heard of fallacy fallacy? Imho the article is pretty bad, to start it off with 7.7bln ppl on the planet and current standards of beauty a albino �� elephant might be actually a pretty good investment, store of value not so much but it's just a dumb example. It seems like the author picked the elephant to belittle btc as he himself acknowledges that anything can be a store of value, but here is a catche there is a difference b/w store of value and good store of value. Get goes on to say that btc was proven not to scale for world wide use and his right but he fails to mention that Bitcoin being a software undergoes multitude of iterations as in internet from 1990 would not scale for streaming Netflix yet here we are, I can go on and on but what's the point the article is poorly written the arguments are really nothing new and were knocked down at least a dozen of times already so yes the author is most likely an idiot for not doing proper research in the first place.

I'm a bull but wanna take a stab. If most countries block Fiat gateways (Europe USA China...) By forcing banks to not allow any Bitcoin purchases/sells price will plummet than the same countries develop a blockchain alternative to btc but strictly controlled by a central bank. Btc still exists but has no chance for mainstream adoption, centrally controlled coin becomes the new deflationary store of value.
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:27:42
Cool story bro. But as long as power goes thru the grid I'll be able to barter with all the world no need for Fiat.

Socialism is an idea and btw has nothing to do with fascism, socialism does not create corporatism( w/e it means to you) people do, the same way capitalism didn't create all those charters that colonized half the world and wrecked chaos on them. As mentioned above socialism in it's philosophical meaning to many represents freedom for majority not minority, many see capitalism as the opposite. There are good things in to be found in both imho, personally I strongly oppose current libretarian ideology b/c the omnit to  mention( in my oppinion purposefully) that capital is largely monopolized by few and in such situation it is very unlikely that capitalism will ever work for many.

Taxes can be collected in btc, those taxes than can be used to fund healthcare, education etc. The only difference would be that govt wouldn't be able to inflate the economy to cover their asses for irresponsible spending. That's all there is to it. In addition those social programs are not free, personally I lean toward libretarianism and honestly see tax funded healthcare and education as a benefit, otherwise liberty is strictly correlated with capital hence not everyone would have it as not everyone is born to wealth.

In theory nothing should happen as long as you pay taxes. Some ppl may wish to avoid paying taxes and stay under the radar. On another hand since crypto is so loosely regulated some banks might simply refuse to accept the transfer or block the account due to regulatory gray area that they don't want to dive in, I know of a bunch of ppl in Europe that had that problem but didn't hear of it happening in usa yet.

Dunno what he meant but there is more to electricity than mode of production for example in US only 30% of plants burn coal for electricity and in total 60% uses gases/oil/coal, but with outdated infrastructure other challenges are present such as loss at high distance transport, loss at outlet.

The value of those stocks does not represent the value of the companies, it represents the value of future earnings of respective companies some might never realize. Asserting that Bitcoin does not do anything is flaved imho, it's hard money allows people to store value of their work in an asset that does not deflate. I come from stock background and I'm pretty sure r/btc  has some people who know more about finance than most normies or even people working in finance. Of course it depends what you define as finance, definitely not keynesian economics.

Ok I think now I got it on page 13 they say that 1 in 10 ontarians own or used to own crypto which would make it 10% but that is misleading to say 50% sold , since it combines the 2 metrics.

@_date: 2018-07-03 05:45:39
Page 15 deals with reasons for owning crypto there is not a single mention of this there. I found something in the beginning of that report that says that 5 percent own crypto and 4 percent  used to own, but I don't think in this case it is equal to 50 percent decline. At this point I'm too invested in this shit not to dig to the bottom of this�� btw their conclusions don't even mention it either.
@_date: 2018-07-03 04:33:03
Again I think the title is clickbait. Even from the link you posted only 5 percent of ontario pop owned crypto and in that article all I got is that it went down to 4 or the other way around from 4 to 5. But even if it would go from 4 percent to 2 which would mean decline by half titling it as a decline of 50percent is to say the least misleading.
Edit: mabye I'm going blind or should print that study and read it properly but right now going quickly through it there is nothing there that warrants such title of the article from ccn.
