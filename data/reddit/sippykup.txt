Because of the record date for the Bitcoin Gold distribution.  See my top-level comment.

Yesterday was the record date for the GBTC Bitcoin Gold distribution.  People were buying it up ahead of that in order to get that dividend paid.  Then this morning there was a big sell-off as the premium started returning to historical levels.  It overcorrected, dipped down to 1352, and returned to more typical premium at about 1600.  It was a great buying opportunity. :)

I just did a withdrawal in BTC from Mtgox yesterday expecting it to take a long time based on all of the complaints I'd seen about them. I had my money about 10 minutes later. They seem to have improved a lot.
