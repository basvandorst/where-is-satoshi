If anyone has any questions, I will answer them I as I have time to get to them. You can verify this account by looking at the public post from the Pastebin I posted:

Zeitcoin issue was upon a daemon update by Zeitcoin that broke transaction fees, and upon updating, it "undid transaction" refunding users who had sold Zeit their coins, and keeping the BTC it was sold for. 
This happened likely because of the way the site was coded, using user accounts in the Daemon API as the main way to track user balances and conduct trades.

I'm guessing that Moolah_ is offering over market value out of his own pocket to increase volume and awareness of Prelude.

I saw the same thing with CryptoRush, and now there's talks of embezzlement from the new team...

1) Withdraws only work when someone else makes a deposit. Coin balances are correct per user, but the BTC wallet overall is empty. 
2) There were no reserves, it was all taken ~March 11th in what the devs say was an exploit attack on the site based on some code in github that they uploaded and was "brute forced" (Don't know legitimacy of brute force or what not. They claim to have found the "hacker" based on his IP and he was a registered user of the site on that IP, through social searches of email they say they know who it was. 
3) The site to my knowledge never arbitraged with MintPal, there were many DDOS and HTTP flood attacks on the site is what I was told.

Proof of Stake, you get compounding interest every 8 hours on mature coins, totaling 1% more coins every year

I apologize if you think badly of me, but I really did believe that it was possible that they had caught the hacker and were Doxing him to authorities.  As I said, I was entirely conflicted, and believed that they were capable of replacing the coins until we lost site volume and were not making enough fees to keep funds.

Things around there have been sketch lately. Though a new team of developers is actually legally signing documents to take over the exchange, I have no idea what that means for the insolvency. Sygma (the guy now behind the reigns) has publically announced that all debts to customers would be repaid, but with around 1200 BTC in debts between the hack, and coin daemon issues, that's a lot of money to pay back.

CryptoRush learned accounts are bad, hence why they lost a ton of money using that as their ledger.

I am in no where near the situation Snowden is, I just mean that I think the truth always deserves to be known.
