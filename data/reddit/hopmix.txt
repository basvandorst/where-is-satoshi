Depends on her interest rate. I was locked into consolidation at 1.5 a few years back. I have other debts that are in the 4%. They come first. However, If my investments are generating a higher return than the interest is costing. I keep the debts. Understand getting out of debt but OPM is the way to go if you can manage it.  Keep your cash until the bitter end. 
Edit: student loan debt sucks because it's not forgivable.  Not saying don't pay off debts.

It’s not the end all be all.  I equate it with handicapping horse races. Helps you make a decision. Won’t stop that 40-1 horse from having the race of his life and busting up your trifecta box.  It’s not death or taxes.

You don’t get it.  I sold the majority of my coins into tether in Jan just under an ath.  It’s been sitting there since. If there are hundreds of thousands of people like me?

no fees.

I just YouTubed things. Hung out on home improvement sub on Reddit and referenced Michael Litchfields Renovation 4th edition.   Bigger point being I only put down 3%.  I’d never been able to afford a place if I had to save 20%. It’s tough to save that type of cash while lying rent as well.

Take that money. Put a down payment on a house close to your parents. Rent that shit out until you get back. When you get back, take out an equity loan and buy a second property. Rent that.
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:46:42
I bought a property with 3% down.  Did some improvements.  Increased the value, refinanced after 6 months. now I have 10% equity.

Coinbase fees are getting silly. 0.20% for under a million in monthly volume.

I'd look somewhere around the Florida/GA Line.

Coinbase added like 5 million new users in the last few months. They carry 4 assets.  Litecoin is dead?  Lmao

And a war between tether and the SEC.

They could do the same thing for bitcoin.  If they can take down all these child porn rings that operate on the dark web behind encryption, they can certainly bust all the retailers moving BTC around wallets and trying to cash them out into something useable.  All they have to do is throw money at the problem and they have an unlimited supply that they can print when every they want. That's backed by a massive military force.
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:12:36
No.  They are issued 1099  just like everyone else and if hes not paying taxes hell eventually ends up in prison.  Any accountants can correct me on this. If he's paid in BTC he owes tax on the initial money earned (income tax federal and state) plus if BTC spikes 40% he now has to pay a capital gains tax on that when he converts back to dollars.  Plus he has to pay a Fee to convert it back to dollars on an exchange.  Which he has to do because BTC hasn't reached a level of adoption as a payment system to survive on it solely.
@_date: 2019-10-04 06:42:47
Is this based on your monthly trading volume?
@_date: 2019-10-09 23:37:10
9k then the real dump.
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:04:35
They are just 1099 you so they don't have to pay medical or tax on your fulltime employment.  That's now your responsibility.  As an employer, I would prefer this.  It may be true you may be earning more but it depends on how the hours mesh out.   They have things like 6 weeks of vacation they get paid to go on, for example.  You have to pay for your own medical which could eat up another 8-10% of your gross.

Not scared. Want better price.

US still holds a shit ton of gold.  So if they really want to regain world domination, wouldn’t it make sense to hyper inflate fiat into nothingness so we are forced back to gold standard?

Bitfinex artificially pumps the market?
@_date: 2019-04-15 01:29:45
Happy to sell it to them at 30k.
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:01:12
its going the wrong direction for that  at the moment.
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:12:11
You’re conditioned by a year and a half of bear market. Same way everyone on here a year and a half ago was saying... 3000 dollar btc is impossible.  It makes it really hard to decide what to do.  Leaning to the downside. But I’m also conditioned to expect BTC FUD  and 50% correction any moment now. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:25:12
4200 resistance. It goes back down to double bottom. If you missed it get your buy orders set. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:16:15
Pretty good.  Thanks.

I consider zero under 1 cent.  I throw pennies away because they aren’t worth the space they take up.  Btc doesn’t take up space tho so I’d prolly keep those.  
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:41:52
Apple actually has a business model. They have income.  They have employees.  They make and sell products.  Not sure how this relates to BTC in  any way.  Lol.

I prefer electric.   Go Ducati for the sound and acceleration.

Actually. Porsche mission E is definitely what I'll be driving in two years.  Lambo will do an electric as well.

Always thought food price it directly related to the price of a barrel of oil. Fossils increase in price. So does food.

Depends on when she bought.  Those 17k bags are heavy.

I think being the opec dollar helps out a lot but the question I want answered is where can I get my hands on a  box of Big Mac dollars.

Won’t touch $2000 this year. 2019 maybe. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 23:24:03
You think they buy it all at once?  They may have price targets and buy as it trickles down at different prices. In the grand scheme of things, its all at a discount from its ATH.
@_date: 2018-12-22 05:26:45
Shorts were at a massive high in December. A lot of people not only saw it coming, but wagered heavily on it.  If you aren’t familiar with cboe and what it did to the price of btc then you may not  understand why it went to 20k in first place. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:28:38
Buying now and selling at 12:30 pm on New Years makes you a mark ass mf’r.

But paper bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 11:31:57
Yeah you didn’t read that clearly. It says they may buy at different price points as it trickles down.  I have 150 million. I’m comfortable investing 10% at 7500. 10% at 6500. If it hits 3000 I’ll drop 50%. 
Ect.  Keep being a dick. Suits you.
