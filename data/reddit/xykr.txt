Malware could just read clear text passwords from memory after decryption.

This software has been around for quite a long time and it's actually quite effective against most keyloggers (I don't know any publicly available ones which are able to bypass it). The company seems to be trusted by many enterprise customers.
Basically, it intercepts keystrokes at ring 0 (kernel level) and encrypts them. A browser plugin (or a userland process which passes the resulting clear text using a DLL injected into the target process or a runtime patch, for applications which lack a plugin interface) then decrypts the data. This means that the usual mechanism for keyboard input handling is circumvented, and none of the Windows APIs which are used by keyloggers return any meaningful data.
This means that unless the attacker has elevated rights and sufficient knowledge, he can't do much. A process with user rights (not UAC elevated) lacks the privileges to mess with the ring 0 implementation or the browser executable.  For most script kiddies, the hacking attempt would end right here.
A dedicated attacker still has a quite few choices, he could, for example,…
 - …replace the browser executable (hard, he'd have to change source code and recompile the browser) or install a rogue plugin (much easier, used to be possible without elevated rights, not sure if this is still true for the major competitors)
 - …simply uninstall the software and replace it with a mock interface so that the user doesn't notice that it's gone
 - …reverse-engineer the software and find a way to get the session key
 - …use the Windows API to extract the clear text from the input fields (wouldn't work for most browsers though, but for "normal" applications)
 - …injecting a custom DLL / memory dumping
 - …install a hardware keylogger, if he has physical access
 
After all, if an attacker has Administrator rights on your machine and a sufficient amount of time, he will most likely get what he wants. He has the same level of access than you.
Funny enough, the Bitcoin client isn't even supported.
tl;dr: There's no such thing as security, and it won't stop a dedicated attacker, but this program makes it much, *MUCH* harder for them (by forcing them to build custom tools instead of using a simple keylogger). If it were free, and if I would do any sensitive work on Windows (I don't), I'd give it a try.
