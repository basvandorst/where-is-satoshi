I get paid a base plus commission.  My commissions are normally 25 to 100+% of base pay.
Since we still live in fiat land, I would take my commissions in BTC...and gladly.
BUT talking about a bookkeeping disaster for my employer.  I won't push the issue.

I'm up for that also.  Cool offer.

This was a non KYC account.  Transfers in, yes.  Very few trades.  No transfers out until my 24 hour notice.
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:06:50
Heh.  Not even close.

What further information would be needed?  US citizen in a 'permitted State' at a US exchange.
I'm not namedropping.

They gave me 24 hours to withdraw before closing it.

The communications were from their internal support system via email.  
Their support did ask me to download some odd video service for a video conference.  I told them this wasn't an option for a non KYC account.

Oddly, this is the least scammy most straight up, secure exchange in existence...by my opinion.
@_date: 2019-12-19 20:28:25
I will confirm this was not coinbase.

I simply wish not to namedrop.
Yes US.  Not Coinbase.  Over 18.  No clue how I would know about tainted coins.  Not over 10K.  No reason to call the authorities.  I did mention that if a security flaw was noticed on my end that I demand they release that information to me for both of our protection.  They repeated they couldn't disclose.
All the coins, minus the dust were withdrawn without complication.
Is there and ELI5 somewhere on tainted coins?  I'm just a simpleton exchange user and all this tech stuff goes a little beyond my comprehension.
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:17:00
Or a rouge support identity theft attempt.
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:03:26
I really prefer not to go there.  Sorry.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:01:44
No.  I was given 24 hours to withdraw funds before they closed it.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:19:56
Exchanges filters?  I'm sure there's a ton of stuff they can see that a user will never be privileged of.  Wish I knew what was triggered.
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:11:35
Possibly, but they never asked if I would complete the KYC to remedy.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:52:02
You're fkn crazy.
