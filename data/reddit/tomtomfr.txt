In a few months or even weeks might be your GF that looks stupid when the price would be far bellow 10k ;)
And charts should be taken carrefully in the case of bitcoin where price is highly influenced by political and social news (much more than fiat currencies). 2018 would be the year of altcoins regulation and it would certainly affect their price durably, whatever some delusionnal people may think  (recovering from a crash at 400$ to 200$ with the Mt Gox episode is certainly not the same as if the crash happen now and the price goes from 12k to 6k).

If you actually knows what bitcoin and blockchain are, you know bitcoin (and other altcoins) is clearly over-rated and that the bubble will pop one day or another.
Economists that claims that bitcoin could be the new gold or that the bitcoin price will still grow exponentially just because blockchain is a technology that will more and more be adopted in the future are actually the stupid ones as they don't understand that the blockchain technology do not depend on high cryptocurrencies prices to be used.

No one knows. What we know for sure is that all major countries are currently pushing for a higher regulation (or ban in some case) of cryptocurrencies. And I see no world where this could push the price up and not down...
