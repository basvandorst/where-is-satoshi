I think you're making a valid point point here, but I'm a bit confused. What do you mean by 
"It is declared *by fiat* it does not emerge organically out of the free market like gold or cryptocurrencies."
"a cryptocurrency build on a set of rules that penalises the acquisition of its native tokens is disincentivising users" 
And ill point out that it will come down to 2 major crypto currencies, maybe 3. The drop off in users will make the other crypto currencies worthless. Not to confuse things whats your take on universal basic income, using say a fiat currency?

So thank you for the reply and I kinda thought about this one a bit. There's some big progressive ideas here, which would require a complete overhaul of our current system. That's just not gonna happen any time soon if ever. But there's some question to still be answered. One being could a non fiat currency event be capable of replaceing our current fiat (USD for bitcoin)? Where our govt is able to function as it needs to with a currency it adopted, which id say not yet nor soon. And another is, where will crypto currency stop? Are people going to using it in daily interactions for every day goods or will it just remain a novelty?

"No one is going to opt in to a currency that redistributes what you own."
Is that not our current way of doing things? Seems to me like a lot of my pay check is gone before I event get it. And not just taxes, im talking bills too.
