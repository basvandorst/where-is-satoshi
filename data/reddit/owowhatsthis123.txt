I’m a student in high school it’s a lot to me

I’m not nearly knowledgeable enough. I’m just asking for (yes I see the irony) other people to come together to create it. I wouldn’t have problems funding it but developing is a no go for me especially on this scale.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:15:25
I’m definitely not a bot

I came to r/bitcoin because it’s my first favorited subreddit, I didn’t do it in meirl because when I was trying to find a name to remember I got hungry and went to make lunch and then it backed me out of it so I just went to the first subreddit on my list and tried it. If it didn’t work I would try another name

I’m not panicked, I’m not happy but I followed the first rule to an extent, I can live without the money but it would put a hold and something I’ve been saving up form
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:37:57
That’s a good thought

I guess my watch and portable battery was purchased with reddit karma then

Testing the naming thing since I’ve never done it before, I found him on another subreddit

I’m talking about apps specifically. Every bank I know has an app

Heyo 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:16:29
I ran out of fiat to buy the dip, and for the first time since I bought in I’m in the negative about 16 dollars with a total of 290 dollars invested. That’s just bitcoin. Don’t even talk about litecoin, that really sucked.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:55:51
I don’t have any more money to buy with man
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:38:14
You should 
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:38:33
2meirl4meirl is better though

Idk I’ve never used the call feature before and wanted to try it 
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:37:21
You were on r/me_irl probably 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:10:04
My mom keeps saying bitcoin is the terrorist currency and only terrorists use it. It’s obviously working

I could have bought apple in 2007 but I never did, never focus on what it’s or I should have. It sucks but until the lizards reveal time travel we are fucked 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:46:16
Too much work 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:48:02
I don’t know why people keep saying gold has no value. It does but not for jewelry, it’s great for electronics and being a good conductor 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:55:39
I put another 100 in at 7k at panic sold at 11k, never making that mistake again 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:31:35

Meta as fuck
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:24:59
Yeah not worth it for me, only have 300 dollars worth but want to secure it for future you know 
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:49:07
Yeah I guess they just don’t use euros for your guys’s heroin problem 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:15
Yeah well I go to school so that’s not really and option 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:12

@_date: 2017-12-20 12:42:59
Happy cake day 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:07:09

@_date: 2017-12-12 19:44:00

If I buy rn it will be 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:22:26
People are fucking buying like crazy. I sold my 100 dollars at 9300 for 112 dollars but it kept going up so I rebought yesterday
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:40:56
Because everyone else is trying to 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:09:39
Alright that’s good then 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:17:00
Same, I still get it but it takes forever to receive it 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:46:24
They said around 7 to 10 days and same with my checks, it’s been 2 days so far lol 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:06:39
I’m a student with no job so for now it’s a big deal but defiantly worth the risk but I would still own something, I’m fine with gambling my money but I just don’t want to lose it in some glitch or something 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:23:33
I’m using suntrust but through the app it doesn’t end show any pending charges 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:19:43
It happened yesterday too 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:02:55
I can’t right now, with school and stuff it’s pretty hard to manage and I don’t have a car yet
Edit: still only have my learners permit anyway 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:05:11
Does gdax have an app on iPhone 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:44:38
I’m scared to, I haven’t bought it before and I’m going to put 200 into it but it keeps going up I don’t know when to buy : (
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:47:15
I’m not a holder though sadly 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:46:44
Damn, I’ll probably just go through Coinbase since the rate is low anyway 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:01:19
I’m using my account to link to Coinbase, my card hasn’t come in the mail yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:07:26
I’m thinking of putting either 700 which is everything I have to my name or 200 dollars 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:28:52
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:29:37
Issa joke

Fud

@_date: 2018-02-15 14:40:15
They aren’t incels. Incels involuntarily don’t get women. Mgtow is a choice that some men take to go their own way and I think it’s respectable 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:29:43
? 
The incels slightly flooded it but the core people just aren’t interested in a relationship and want to further their own careers. How’s that a bad thing?
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:02:17
I guess but it would be really nice if I could just use my PayPal
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:36:28
What do you mean by trust person
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:00:07
I actually kinda like it. Fun to go through and have discussions with them and listen to stories. Then again I thought incels was a cool subreddit to go through but they never had conversations they were just salt
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:52:08
sadly I don't have any :( I usually stay in my own grade for friends
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:11:36
r/mgtow dude
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:55:22
This is the time to buy and now I'm fucked :(
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:31:05
I don't have a car and I don't think my parents would drive me
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:56:29
Wouldn't the price have gone back up by then 
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:31:30
No
