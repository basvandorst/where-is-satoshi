When you try to "regulate" bitcoin's p2p lending market, anon investors go away.
When you ask full documentation to borrowers, borrowers go away.
Result: dead bussiness

This feed of news, which is great, usually it shows the trends of daily discussions, that is why I always go there first and save a lot of time reading others stuffs.
Agree with you, an independent and complete source of news is missing on the cryptsphere. We see a lot of paid articles which is not good for the "truth", if any.
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:23:24
It looks all natural to me
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:42:11
The problem with the BTCJam are mostly the investors, because they do not do the enough research on the borrower and they invest in all kind of shit. I always had profit in there. I only invested on people that I knew/know.
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:54:51
De facto? What it means? o.O
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:42:37
...and nowadays is easy to find people through Social Networks...
@_date: 2017-01-14 01:10:41
Yeah, i was still reading about it...in diferent locations too...
Not "humm" now, but, yes, no hardfork :)

Humans are responsible for the increasing of CO2, yes. But the real problem is the water vapor. Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas. It controls the Earth’s temperature.

Nice. So, you still there trying to pay your beer? With the frequent spam attacks, i would love to be there waiting for payment... ahahha... at least more beers would be fun :D
Enjoy it ;)
@_date: 2017-01-26 13:13:53
I use multiple source of news all over the internet and traditional newspapers dude. I make my own conclusions. 
-7 points because of that is very funny basead on biased opinions from that channel viewers... anyway...
@_date: 2017-01-28 00:55:45
This table **IS NOT CORRECT**. 
Please be accurate and do more investigation before you post info like this. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:40:08
better place a bet on soccer or MMA with those coins...or even better, to pump some shitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:45:40
Easy...buy high, sell low
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:40:34
...and what about pump ltc?
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:29:47
CNN...pufff. I will not waste time reading that

About this show, well, some weeks is nice, some weeks is awfull. 
Today it was not so special. Tone is always speaking, and dont left enough room to others speak. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 13:48:28

@_date: 2016-11-23 17:37:34
Yeah right, nice publicity to bitcoin... :/ 
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:38:36
Announcement here: 
@_date: 2016-12-09 19:51:12
Yes it would be... sometimes the truth is in front of our eyes and we cant see it.
And...thanks for all the negative points in my initial statement, folks.
@_date: 2016-11-03 02:11:50
Up or down, BTC always tend to break something and give you tokens instead
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:15:15
I heard that USD and BTC were ded for, at least, 100 times each :)
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:01:52
Dude, blockchain has no end...
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:14:13
..and below atmosphere, underground,  the earth is cooling. Its being cooling for a few time.
@_date: 2016-12-09 19:57:44
The perfect cover
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:42:03
Poor guys dont even have money to spend on food... sad shit going on there...whats the point?
@_date: 2016-12-13 00:58:27
Wow, great...More downtime issues on blockchain.info :P
@_date: 2016-12-16 01:18:29
Just use Bitsquare next time. Fuck all these exchanges. Someday another one will collapse as btc price continues to rise. "Be your own bank" and be smart
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:32:05
Theymos is Satoshi... Period.
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:39:23
LTC too
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:42:46
Who is Tone Vays? o.O
@_date: 2016-12-27 00:49:33
All media is "corrupted". Here and outside here. Otherwise they will be bankrupt very fast
@_date: 2016-11-13 03:05:07
Adoption is more important than the price
@_date: 2016-12-16 01:20:06
retirement for who? lel
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:45:14
R&amp;D or P&amp;D o.O
@_date: 2016-11-15 18:48:30
oh no...vitalik's fault again
@_date: 2016-12-09 19:57:06
Of course it is a strong candidate...
"satoshi email was compromised" was his worst announcement
@_date: 2016-11-29 17:54:06
**Its a lot of bits in fees, in that case...**

Algorithms can be improved without changing the purpose of it.
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:01:16
wut top? there is no top!!!
@_date: 2016-10-15 16:25:05
Yes, you can. Use this exchange 
@_date: 2016-10-31 17:33:48
That clock is right, at least, 2 times a day
@_date: 2016-10-27 12:15:45
The "brain" wallet ;)
@_date: 2016-10-01 22:41:17
expect some pump or some crash as usually :P
@_date: 2016-10-30 23:13:54
Just sell/short, rebuy later, or increase your bag now... or hold... So many options...Why panic?
@_date: 2016-10-27 21:36:07
We have an hacker somewhere ready to dump the finex stolen coins...my coins too 
@_date: 2016-10-21 23:38:49
Both and perhaps the next time. Just pay attention to some details explained in this interview with CEO of Bitgo. Open your eyes and read between the lines 
@_date: 2016-10-01 23:33:29
Nice way to promote his business. I hope it wont fail
@_date: 2016-10-15 15:56:44
Just dig a hole in your backyard... :)
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:41:03
It's not a rally. its an "organic growth" 
@_date: 2016-10-21 23:12:05
These finex guys are hilarious. Unbelievable!
@_date: 2016-10-28 01:12:20
Is this [issue/exploit]( fixed?
@_date: 2016-10-22 22:52:07
This kind of moves scares me a lot. Its better to leave the coins on the wallet, because every time the price rises, some exchange is "hacked". Just my 2 sats
@_date: 2016-10-30 17:40:00
nah, make it 799 instead ;)
@_date: 2016-10-21 23:47:32
...and i sold my BFX before they crash into the level of some shitcoins...
If they got the coins back, will I have my money back... Probably not! 
@_date: 2016-10-21 23:27:01
You still might be wrong. That dont proves nothing!
@_date: 2016-10-27 12:14:37
Every time the btc price rises, some "hack" appears..lel
