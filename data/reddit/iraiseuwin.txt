Keep in mind, only half as many new coins are being mined compared to the $1200 bubble. People seem to be asking similar questions as the previous bubble though. Back when it first passed $1k people thought mass adoption would make it go non-stop to the moon. Then it started to dip, and everyone wondered if there would be enough momentum to buy the dips and sustain the bull market... seems like history repeating, but a lot has changed for btc/crypto since then. We'll see what happens!

**402 Payment Required:** Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, as proposed for example by GNU Taler[36], but that has not yet happened, and this code is not usually used.

Okay, so this vulnerability involves the potential manipulation of future unspent outputs only? Should I care if I do not plan on ever using my Ledger wallet for any transaction less than the full amount in my wallet? Say I'm using it solely for cold storage, and the only time I would move any coins would be a complete sweep of the wallet... .?.. Even if I plan on doing a test transaction before I sweep the coins, isnt it just as safe to do nothing now, and simply update the firmware before I perform the test transaction? I feel like maybe I could be missing something here

We could be feeling the supply pinch from the most recent halving. About one year after the block reward went from 50btc to 25btc, the price jumped up. It's been a little over a year since the most recent halving, so it could be happening again.

You could transfer the btc to an exchange, like [coinbase]( [Poloniex]( or [bittrex]( then trade for USD. You'd have to register for accounts and provide a lot of personal info.

If he (they) could move them in a way that wouldn't destroy public confidence in BTC, then maybe.  Like if they donated coins to some type of political cause, I could see that.  Trading them for fiat currency would not be good for BTC, or for Satoshi's holdings. He (they) would lose millions before they could sell them.

Coinbase seems to jump through hoops to comply with KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money laundering) laws. To me they seem like one of the most reputable sources to buy from. All of this compliance kills anonymity though. [Poloniex]( seems like a pretty legit exchange. I think they follow similar KYC/AML regulations. You could use localbitcoin or find a bitcoin atm if you're concerned about anonymity. I do not have experience with the new decentralized exchanges, like [Bisq]( but it looks promising if you have some tech skills.
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:32:33
It's fine to keep it on Coinbase for a few days. The first time you buy Bitcoin it will probably take longer than you think if you're using an exchange. After you have some type of verified account it is much smoother. You can try a bitcoin ATM for more anonymity, but you will pay a premium... if you're concerned about current price vs price in a week or two, consider how long you plan on holding your investment. It will go up and down a lot. If you plan on cashing out if you quickly make a few hundred $$, then maybe look at some TA. Might as well just flip a coin imo. If you plan to hodl I'd get in asap, or do some cost avg strategy. If you believe in it in the long run, then these hundred dollar swings wont mean much.

Thanks buddy! Think of it this way... You can pay more and have someone do it for you, or pay less and learn (struggle) for yourself. I was a command line beginner when I started Stadicus' Raspibolt tutorial, and it took a few tries, but I got it working. LN is changing and developing so fast, who's to say how long your purchased plug n' play node might work before it requires an update. You'll have to know at least a little to update it I'd imagine. Also, what better time to learn about LN than now!? LN Spring is upon us! Hell of a time to be alive

1. Adoption of bitcoin is becoming more and more widespread (among a growing world population of 7.5 billion people)
2. Widespread adoption will stabilize the price (once "widespread adoption" is reached)
With your "feeling" that $20k is a high point, that means that the total market cap of Bitcoin (after all coins are mind in the year ~2140 ((assuming that ZERO coins are lost)) will be $420 billion) 
The current market cap of gold ALONE is over $7 Trillion.
I guess a follow up question for you would be, why do you "feel" that Bitcoin is anywhere near "widespread adoption"? Demand drove the price to $20k in 2017, yet Bitcoin is still nearly inaccessible to the majority of the world's population.

As far as I understand, LN purpose is to facilitate instant transfers of small amnt of value without the need for a trusted third party. It seems to me like it will eventually be valuable for businesses to run LN nodes to verify their own every day transactions. The monetary benefit comes from eliminating the need for a third party to verify small transfers of value. Have you ever faced a situation at a convenience store where you needed to spend at least $xx amnt to be able to use a debit/credit card?
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:05:01
Thank you for all you've done to help make Bitcoin what it is today. I think I love you, you've changed my life!... when I first became interested in bitcoin I was mainly concerned about transaction time and btc's heavy dependence on internet access. LN seems to be solving the transaction speed issues, and your satellites are making internet less of a necessity for btc. Do you see any other major hurdles preventing btc from becoming mainstream? Also, do you consider the use of OP_RETURN to be spam activity or do you see a useful place for it in Bitcoin's blockchain?

I think it's more the idea that the case was a complete mockery of the US judicial system. The two FBI agents on the case turned out to be corrupt AF. Look up Carl Mark Force and Shaun Bridges. All evidence should be considered tainted. It is said that those two "held the keys to the Silk Road Kingdom". Who knows what Ulbricht really did or didn't do. The only thing that is 100% clear is that his trial was a  joke, and he deserves a second chance at justice

Cold Storage (offline storage) is the safest option. Paper wallets or Hardware wallets are your best option for cold storage (Ledger or Trezor for hardware wallets). For mobile, I know Mycelium and Breadwallet are good. As far as desktop, maybe Electrum? If you don't want to invest in a hardware wallet, then I would look up tutorials on making a paper wallet. Being in sole possession of the private keys is the most important part.

What does it mean that you "wanted everything to be all in one place"? Buying from Coinbase is safe, storing your coins on Coinbase long term is unsafe. What do you want to be all in one place?

It makes sense for him to be negative towards Bitcoin... He made his fortune on internet/tech during the initial internet boom, but he was late to the party on the biggest tech innovation of our lifetime (bitcoin). Now he is a little salty about it.

Surely in all of his tech brilliance he knows of the existence of [http error code 402]( which has been just waiting for Bitcoin

Yeah. I think it might be slightly unsafe to reuse the same public address, but I also think most wallets automate this process to eliminate the issue. I'd consult someone smarter than me if you're worried (sorry). I just know that Sentinel is good because it only asks for public address to watch balances.

When I started the tutorial I was skeptical of my LCD screen too. The screen was part of an old project, and I remember having a tough time getting it set up back when I first used it.
