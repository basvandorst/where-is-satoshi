No, sorry to report that simplex has not yet delivered my coins, approved the transaction, or canceled the pending charge on my account

Well I purchased btc from CoinGate/Simplex using a credit card and I am starting to regret. I thought it would be the "easiest way to buy btc with credit card" according to their website... So here's the process, they ask for your wallet address, then, all you credit card info, then a selfie of you holding the credit card, then they withdraw funds, and ask for more info like upload of image of you DL, as I was doing this the site crashed, but they withdrew the $$ from my bank account. I got one email from simplex stating--- basically they take your money without verifying!!! Like if you can't handle amount if transactions, DO NOT take peoples money. NOT COOL!!!
"Thank you for submitting your payment. It is currently being verified.
Simplex payment ID: XXXX XXX XX X XXXX
Please note the this verification process may take some time. We appreciate your patience, as we are fully committed to ensure you receive a quick response.
So, what’s going on with your money now?
Simplex is currently verifying your transaction. It is possible that you will notice a charge in your credit card account. This is only an authorization check, automatically made in order to reserve the amount in case the payment is approved. If the payment doesn't go through (cancelled, expired or failed), this authorization check will be voided in no more than 48 hours, and you will not see the charge in your account.
