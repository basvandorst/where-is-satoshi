people were saying the same exact thing a month ago. It didn't work.

I didn't buy BTC for 10000$. A lot of people did, though. And those people will probably never return to crypto. Not the best introduction. Heck, you can't even register at bitfinex without a 10000$ deposit anymore. This WILL heavily slow down progression, if not stopping it completely.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:16:52
Everyone here knows about cyclical crashes and booms. Sorry, we can't all be millionaires. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:00:50
1 DOGE = 1 DOGE
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:19:06
it's called wishful thinking.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:22:21
it's very high for people who bought at 200$
like 50% people bought at 10000+. Drop to 8000$ would shatter the market for months, maybe years.
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:21:46
you can't predict the future looking at the past, there is no correlation between specific dates or periods. Otherwise everyone would be a millionaire.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:59:47
And how does that differ from what people were saying when it dipped from 20k to 18k? 16k? 14k? 12k?
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:00:16
Tulip mania is a myth.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:28:44
that indicates a possible dip to 14k, but I've been wrong before.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:18:50
they are doing a lousy job tbh
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:03:29
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:20:05
they have been hacked months ago.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:17:53
Why are ppl here so obsessed about GDAX when BCH is trading normally on other exchanges and keeps 4000+ $ without any shady moves?
Why is everyone ignoring ZCASH getting to ATH right now despite normally following BTC closely?
What about ETH? It's extremely high and refuses to drop significantly
ALTs are on the rise, blaming shitcoin cash won't save us at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:28:57
it just crashed to 10500$ so it doesn't look similar anymore :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:31:25
BCH is actually going up on bitstamp
and BTC is struggling with a measly 16700
cute (not)
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:14:46
some people here take BTC very religiously.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:56:41
If you could predict the future by just repeating past events, you'd be rich. So would be everybody.
In other words, just because it happened once doesn't mean it will happen again.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:11:26
I'm not saying it's impossible, just unlikely with the Korean hack story.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:15:39
Damn, bitstamp couldn't even break through 16800.
going back to 16600. This royally sucks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:31
sure and that's a valid strategy but why at the very bottom of daily value?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:59:31
Head &amp; Shoulders formation likely on BTC.
This means down to 12-14k.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:55:12
MACD at -300
RSI at 28
that's a very strong buy signal... yet nobody's buying, lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:02:52
I honestly don't get why people are actually dumping 20-30 BTC for 16500 
Unless insider info, how can you just throw that away knowing the history of BTC and rebounds?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:05:13
it's not the end most likely. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:06:20
I guess this means no 20k $ ATH this year.
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:15:05
You'd need a crystal ball first.
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:19:26
@_date: 2018-06-17 11:08:37
cause people look at bitfinex, not noticing that bitmex volume is increasing. Bitfinex lost the lead position due to their ridiculous rules.
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:05:36
gambler's fallacy. Google it. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:44:13
Some people? a lot of people makes money shorting BTC. Get on bitmex or kraken and try it out.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:26:12
more like big bollocks
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:32:13
You must be reading poor TA. I've seen plenty of bearish indicators.
Here's the most simple one possible: A descending triangle usually breaks DOWN, not up.
And that's exactly what happened. 
What could've fooled you: not drawing in log scale or drawing on finex which follows USDT price, not USD, despite being called USD.
also, make sure you're free of bias when doing TA. If you're bullish, you may be searching for bullish TA, while it should be as neutral as possible.
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:36:47
redditors are mostly clueless. I'd stray from twitter, reddit and alike, because it has plenty of clueless amateurs drawing lines, especially Elliott waves, which is pretty close to voodoo even by TA standards.
Instead, try learning proper TA from books for starters.
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:37:23
That's because most people are either bad at TA, or not critical enough when their own success bites them in the arse.
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:34:41
This is probably why you're losing money.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:21:44
buy at 8000, sell at 9500, buy at 7500, hold. Thank me later.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:27:43
you pay for it anyway so it's only "free" if you don't understand the basics of economy
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:48:32
not really, I'm doing TA. The same TA allowed me to predict 9500 support and bounce which happened yesterday. By being statistically right 75% of the time I'm making a lot of profit. for the other 25% there's always stoploss. You should average out positive in the end.
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:34:13
Which one? each of them has his own count. A method that produces hundreds of personal interpretations is too complex to be used in trading IMO.
There were easier indicators: declining volume and a descending triangle, for starters.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:34:28
@_date: 2018-12-12 08:51:28
Why would it be?
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:13:27
Most redditors are clueless in general. No risk management, no trading strategy (other than memes, lol). They buy on top, expect a bigger top, get rekt, hold bags for years (sorry, "HODL") on a large loss and increase a losing position (holy grail of this reddit, "DCA") which escalates quickly into even bigger loses. They don't know how to short, they don't even understand what shorting is. They assume TA is voodoo, and/or if they do TA, they jump straight into Elliott Waves which is the hardest, most inconclusive method there is. 
But hey, without them, traders wouldn't profit. Sadly that's how it goes. You need to have a large group of people making rookie mistakes to earn money on stocks, same here.
