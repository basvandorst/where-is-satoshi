Calm down boy. It's impossible that it will just continue endlessly upwards with no down at all. We might see a correction the 10th and 18th when bitcoin is introduced into CBOE and CME group. There is a good shorting opportunity here, even though someone will say it's crazy. We are going to see a correction, how big it will be we don't know. 
It's going to be interesting to see what all the new buyers who bought in during november - december this year is going to do when for example big whales sell a lot and the price drops quite a bit. They have only encountered immenesley rise in the price in short time and might panic  seeing it going down fast, and if that happends, gheeze. But hey, it's cryptoworld, anything can happend.

I have a question.
After months of bloodbath on both sides (BTC and alts). What will happend to alt-coins when BTC is starting the upwards/bull-trend again?
Usually alt-coins go down when BTC rises, since people sell their alts to buy btc to gain value. The last months we have seen alts value plummet down the drain. Do you think alt-coins will go even further down to new levels we haven't seen when BTC rises after this long correction? Or will they stabilize on the red levels they have now?

There must be people like me, standing with fiat in their hands, who have been watching the market for months and waiting it to turn/stabilize. Right now it's good prices for alts and yeah btc. But the question is more specific, should fiat go into BTC or ALTS when the market/BTC is turning bullish/upwards? 
Since right now there is some great offers for alt-coins, but I'm worried their value will be reduced even more when BTC will surge. Eventhough it's quite hard to imagine, after all these months of bloodbath for them..
