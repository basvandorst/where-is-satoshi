Money supply is just one factor in deflation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:01
And with governments losing their ability to enact monetary supply if bitcoin becomes a thing (their biggest economic tool), I'm willing to bet a lot of money they'll ban cryptocoins as a currency before they willingly give that up.

The problem is that it doesn't work. Ironically, Bitcoin has become unusable. A purchase can take days or weeks to verify unless you pay a huge fee. Want to buy coffee with your bitcoin? You have to tack on a $5 fee and wait an hour+ to verify the transaction occurred. Additionally, the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions are wild speculation and gambling in the hype of a get rich quick scheme. Almost no one is using bitcoin for legitimate day-to-day transactions yet it somehow it climbing in price; it's obvious what is going on. Look up tulip mania.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:49:16
The number of coins in circulation will reach 99.9% in 20 years. Additionally, as long as the price keeps going up, it's still deflationary.

We could go back to a gold standard now, the problem is that the economy becomes less efficient and we are more susceptible to recessions. The fact that it would at least somewhat work in spite of this doesn't make it anywhere close to ideal.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:19:59
 Because a heavily deflationary currency the completely undermines a country's ability to enact monetary policy is exactly what we need. Nothing like a deflationary spiral to seize up the economy right?

Do you have any source for this? Why would any serious investor jump in at the height of what appears like a bubble?

 It was abandoned for fiat in part because you can't enact monetary policy on a gold backed dollar (this was back around the great depresssion).

The problem is that Greece can't control the money supply of Euro, unlike their old currency the Drachma. The only thing Bitcoin would achieve in this regard is allowing Greece's institutions to collapse faster, and that's assuming people weren't storing the majority of their bitcoins in a bank (which people will if it ever became that popular, due to technical limitations on the number of transactions that can occur per minute).

Just because you add a virtual intermediary doesn't magically change the fact that you are still transferring illegal obtained assets, in this case drugs for money (with Bitcoin being the intermediary tool to achieve this). It's no different than selling drugs for an IOU and getting the cash later.

Anyways, altcoins are more publicity for Bitcoin. Dogecoin alone resulted in a ton of news for cryptocoins and the good they can do. They helped fund a beloved team to the olympics, that's not exactly something dark and shady that a lot of people who don't understand cryptocoins think of.

The gold standard was alive and well during the great depression. The issue is that without inflation debt can grow even at 0% interest. A deflationary currency rewards holding your money instead of actively investing it. As people stop spending the scarcity and demand of money goes up, which results in even more deflation. This keeps feeding back on itself until money is so valuable that no one wants to invest since they make more holding it. Without investment in business, there is no money for jobs and job creation, which makes money even more valuable and scarce. And it just keeps going like this. That's a very basic overview of why deflationary money like bitcoin is dangerous; the money itself becomes an investment instead of real assets and businesses.

Bitcoins can only be stolen if you have the password that authorizes you to spend them (so if someone hacked a server that held those passwords). The only other way to lose Bitcoins is to lose the password.

That's horrible. Bitcoin should not rely on the goodness of a person's heart. How the fuck is that secure?
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:31:55
That's the biggest issue with Bitcoin if it ever hopes to become a defacto currency. A deflationary currency results in investment of currency, not investment of real assets, which results in everyone dumping their money into the currency and the economy grinding to a halt. That's why inflation is necessary and exists in all modern monies.
@_date: 2014-01-11 04:09:04
The fact that this is even a realistic possibility is a serious issue for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:29:15
Part of your statement is a little inaccurate though. The government can certainly ban Bitcoin for when it is used in commerce for the exchange of value (as a form of money).

Basically a copy/derivative of Litecoin with a few tweaks to the maximum number of coins and mining difficulty. Dogecoin is exciting because the community is extremely generous (lots of tipping) and very fun. On top of that, although it has only existed for one month its price and adoption has skyrocketed.

The median household debt in America is $70,000, with some 70% of households holding some debt, with there being 117,000,000 households in America (with a household population of 304,130,00). I'd say most Americans are affected directly by inflation helping against their mortgage rate, to say the least. That doesn't account for the average $15,000 in credit card debt per household among all the other debts that your typical American has.

Onion is fake, Dogecoin is very much real. Dogecoin community is more like The Daily Show or Colbert Report. And don't be flaming so much, Dogecoin is all about being friendly.
@_date: 2014-01-20 22:34:34
I'll repeat myself one last time. People with dogecoins either mined them (at a value relatively close to where they have been in the past) or bought them recently. Donations are given not through gained value of people holding the coins but straight from mining or coins purchased recently. People with Bitcoins who donate likely are giving away coins they originally purchased or mined at a dramatically lower price. The key difference being people giving away Bitcoins are giving away something that they held onto and whose value massively increased while holding (we're talking up to several orders of magnitude), unlike Dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:33:42
Please please do your research on deflation and why inflation is necessary for a currency. Why do you think all modern currencies use inflation? A deflationary spiral is what caused the great depression.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:29:08
The inflation rate is 5% the first year, and decreases annually. In a century the inflation will be less than 1%. You have to remember that even Bitcoin still has to experience another 75% inflation before it is fully mined.

I'm not talking about 3 years ago, I'm talking about the community now. A lot of the wealth in Bitcoin is from the past 2 years with the price spikes. In Dogecoin that doesn't exist to any degree comparative to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:37:55
What's interesting about Dogecoin is that unlike Bitcoin, which has exploded in value (and produced many millionaires), Dogecoin donations are largely funded straight out of pocket or by mining and not through the gains they received from price inflation.
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:52:54
It's the power of community and public image, which in a highly speculative market plays an important role. A lot can be learned from Dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:56:40

Depending on the trust of a pool is the **last** thing you can do to prove how secure the protocol is, it completely goes against the security of a "decentralized" currency. All this event proved is that this specific pool at this specific time decided it was worth more for them to keep Bitcoin stable.

Mind you that Bitcoin has matured enough that the wealth concentration had time to distribute, especially when prices skyrocketed and a lot of people sold their coins to new investors. Dogecoin's built in inflation is designed to encourage spending of Dogecoin, which is why it will not be subject to as much hoarding.

I'm not saying what they are doing is wrong, simply that Dogecoin donations are likely straight out of pocket so there is more personal cost to the person. It's the same as comparing some one who won $1,000 and buys everyone a round of drinks compared to someone who didn't win anything and still buys everyone a round of drinks.
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:35:41
I definitely agree. The community is extremely generous, extremely fun, and is the kind of cute thing that your average person will buy into. Bitcoin is the gold standard because it is the founding coin with the most support; Litecoin exists as the "professional"/serious alternative that built up enough support to become legitimate; and Dogecoin is filling what little niche is left for an alternate coin to thrive in. It's like the Disney of cryptocoins.

The reason why Bitcoin is big is because they are big and the first, that alone is no gaurantee. There are several alternative coins that have new innovations to compete against Bitcoin. Dogecoin in particular is interesting due to its built in inflation, which addresses the most serious concern with Bitcoin if we are serious about getting it adopted as an official currency (as of now no modern school of economics supports a deflationary currency).
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:44:11
Agreed. I can't really blame big businesses for not accepting a brand new, prototypical currency, immediately, but slow adoption is good and a good sign of growth. People have to remember that it's Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that have everything to prove, not the other way around.

Actually, anyone who holds money in a simple stock index or other basic well diversified funds will experience returns well above inflation. Additionally, inflation is great for the poor since they usually hold very little money but more debt, which is reduced by inflation.

I do know they haven't bought a significant enough amount to get the price close to its real value (the spread is way too large), which indicates their confidence in their forecast is less than their willingness to bet on it being true.

@_date: 2016-03-29 22:42:34
According to them it's already in a dip... And I didn't say it'd go to $600 if they think it should be that high, I said if they actually bought on the premise that the real value is $600, *then* it'd go up in cost to reflect them buying.
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:33:41

I have a little over 1 bitcoin, I have skin in this game, but it's just all hype right now and as soon as cryptocurrencies become a serious competitor to fiat currency, Governments will either ban its use as a money or people will flip to a superior blockchain (following what companies are currently doing with Ethereum).

As soon as Bitcoin starts to seriously compete with government controlled currencies it will simply be banned, as monetary policy is one of a government's strongest tools for controlling an economy. I know it may sound unlikely, but no government is willing to give up monetary controls, and as soon as it is made illegal no legitimate business will deal with it, pushing it to the black market.
@_date: 2012-12-14 12:17:19
Servers simply have to provide an online service by definition, which they do. An account file simply means that you have a file that lets you access your bitcoin account, which is exactly what it is, access to your bitcoins very much like you would access your money at a bank account. Finally, an account address simply means a number that you use to send money to someone, like an address.

This is one of the few ways you guys can really legitimize bitcoins.

It still bums me that it's still limited to that, it should be divisible by more. For example, if bitcoins replaced dollars in the U.S., considering there is roughly 1*10^13 dollars in existence, and a total of 2.1*10^15 satoshis in existence, the smallest amount you could go is 2.1 cents. If you replaced the world's currency, it goes up even more, and if you factor in population growth over 50 years, the satoshi, if it replaced all currency, has the potential to be worth over a dollar, which is too high for the smallest form of denomination. You'd have to have some way to have banks that held your money fractionalize the satoshi for you. Of course, this is all much too generous, but it's fun to ponder future issues for bitcoin.

It would take thousands of ASICs to make a significant bump, minus all the people quitting due to the recent halving.
@_date: 2012-12-31 03:34:00
Some people are speculating that ASIC producers are hoarding them for mining until mining with them is less profitable than selling, which is when they will start shipping to customers.
@_date: 2012-12-31 03:40:18
By the time that's implemented mining will not be that profitable anyways.

Publicity doesn't matter. As soon as it is illegal it is no longer usable in any business in America. Your local Walmart, Amazon.com, any site and store no longer will accept it and on top of that your average American has absolutely no desire to deal with a blackmarket currency that can't be used at any legitimate store.
@_date: 2012-12-17 08:38:09
Mining with asics may also be unprofitable if ASICs are the only thing doing it, since everyone will be put back on a level playing field.
@_date: 2012-10-06 13:31:26
There's a difference between the largest hobbyist electronics website in the world and some small scale ASIC designer. Unless you are a huge operation you would never buy your own fabrication tools, it's just not economical at that scale. They are either charging way too much for their product or intend to use this money to become a general fab shop.

My concern is what will happen when all the miners stop. One day it won't be worth it, then what? Mining is the  reason Bitcoins are thriving, just ahead of drugs and speculation. These are not stable situations for a currency. If it doesn't gain enough adoption in time, it may have nothing left holding it up. My guess is that it will collapse but still remain in use for things like silkroad at a dramatically reduced value.
@_date: 2012-04-24 20:01:22
It would be very easy. Pass legislation to ban it. Even further, a constitutional amendment could be done to ban it. Once that occurs, all legitimate businesses would no longer accept it, and the vast majority of the population would avoid it, leaving it to only be used in the blackmarket.
@_date: 2012-11-05 22:59:51
That's my biggest fear of when ASICs come out. Right now anyone can mine and generate bitcoins, so a lot of people feel invested in Bitcoin. As soon as the majority of people no longer can easily be a part of Bitcoin, all that is left is speculators and anyone willing to throw down money on ASICs, which is a much smaller portion.

First of all, you are talking about digital items which do not compare to physical goods and services. Secondly, tell me which business do you know that is willing to work with blackmarket currencies that would be used by the general public? I'm not saying bitcoin won't have its place, just that the only place it will have is on the black market.
@_date: 2012-01-16 22:49:38

All it takes is the government making it illegal for it to be made invalid by the general public. A digital currency is great but if no legal business in the country accepts it then it has limited value (in this case, only on the black market).

They enforce it like they do for all laws on businesses. Do you know any legitimate business who would be willing to deal with illegal currency? We're talking Amazon, Walmart, Kroger, local pharmacy, grocery store, supermarket, etc. On top of that, your average person is not going to want to be dealing with illegal currency, especially when they can only spend it on the black market.

Imagine the current recession without the government's interference. Monetary policy is what is keeping us from hitting a depression and suffering from a very hard deflation. You have to actively work to keep an economy from either over heating or slowing too fast, think of monetary policy as shocks on an economy.

No he doesn't. A currency is only a currency if you can use it as a medium of exchange. Right now it has a very limited function in that regard, as the only people accepting it are few and far between. Scarcity means nothing if it's not used by enough people.

Nope, I just like to fully understand a problem and have no issue debating the details.

But when the gold standard was in effect this wasn't an issue. The issue is currency manipulation, a powerful tool for a government to maintain economic stability, which is the same argument against both the gold standard and subsequently bitcoin (and why bitcoin would be made illegal for commerce if it ever gained a strong foothold).
@_date: 2012-09-02 21:40:09
Yay vast oversimplifications! Monetary policy is very important. Economies if unrestricted will cycle through periods of hard overheating followed by depressions, aka bubbles. Inflation is the most important tool in keeping an economy stable, whether it be high interest rates when the economy is ramping up to an unsustainable level, or low interest rates when the economy is ramping down too fast.

I'm willing to bet the vast majority of people have heard about bitcoin in some passing even if they don't remember it. If Bitcoin is so unknown that Ellen making a passing mention about it is huge news, then this is just pathetic. Bitcoin is way past this. Who cares if she happens to mention it.

That's assuming the price goes up or maintains. If most miners are abandoning it then the price shoots down, more miners leave, snowball effect as one possibility.

 The huge spike in price is a good sign that it's being driven by speculators, unless its use in the past few months for legitmate purchases has grown exponentially which I doubt. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:11:54
That's only because Bitcoin is the most popular. Other blockchains use more secure hashing algorithms (against quantum computers) or more secure mechanisms to protect it. Also Bitcoin is vulnerable to network partitions.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:43:44
Bitcoin only started to gain real value about 4 years ago. The problem with Bitcoin is that popularity is the only thing feeding into it, the technology is rapidly increasing and superior blockchains already exist like Ethereum which can have long lasting utilization by companies. All it takes is one massive scare and a shift to a different coin to bankrupt bitcoin's value. It's still too fragile, although there is no doubt that some blockchain in the future will have a very real and very applicable worth beyond mostly speculation and black market use.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:29:58
That's good, but the issue is that there is a huge difference between bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. This sounds more like an argument for cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2017-10-26 22:16:30
Bitcoin was the first, and the only thing it has going for it right now over other cryptocurrencies (that also solve the double spending problem) is that it is popular. Technologically speaking, it is very primitive and inferior to other blockchains like Ethereum. The second people start to shift to a superior blockchain, it's over for Bitcoin and its value disintegrates. The only thing driving its current value is speculation which can't last forever.

I just can't see how cryptocurrencies could ever be allowed to compete with current fiat currencies. The U.S., Eurozone, and China's (the big 3) strongest economic tool is their money supply. To lose that economic control to a currency that can't be traced and can't be controlled is a huge threat. All it takes is for a country to impose high fees on its use as a currency and all legitimate business will immediately cease using it, which means you would only be able to use it on the black market (which your average joe would never bother doing over just using normal money). Bitcoin has a likely permanent place in the blackmarket, but beyond that I really doubt it.

Considering its already been covered by nearly every major newspaper and even had special coverage on CNBC, its safe to say it hit a peak that will take a very long time to get back to again.

This in particular is an identical situation to what is occurring here. I can assure you that the majority of people aren't buying bitcoins for purchasing goods but for speculative reasons. It's just something to think about, I am aware there are differences.
@_date: 2013-03-20 01:16:51
I highly doubt your average person is willing to give up all the advantages of purchasing from local stores and online sellers just to buy the same thing at a higher rate/longer shipping time internationally. You simply can't compete with companies like Amazon which have distribution centers locally and can ship free in 2 days at prices you can't beat. On top of that your average person wants to retain their ability to shop locally at brick and mortar shops and restaurants.

This reminds me of when comics were selling for an all time high in the 90s. Just a frenzy of hype exploded their value way beyond what it should have been. Right now bitcoin's transactions are 99.9% market speculation with the remainder being almost entirely silkroad and a negligible fraction in niche bitcoin stores (such as that electronics online store) and donations. People are buying bitcoins because they are going up, pushing the value up more. Obviously this will eventually saturate as everyone buys into the hype, then things get really unpredictable and possibly very scary when all these people who bought simply to sell later on no longer see it going up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:23:58

@_date: 2013-03-19 19:47:16
The thing is, if Bitcoin ever became popular enough to compete with USD on a serious level, it'd be banned or over regulated by the government, even if it required new legislation. There is no way in hell the U.S. government would ever let anything compete with their number one fiscal tool and source of income.

Precisely. The last thing China wants to do is devalue the Dollar, that would directly cut into both their reserves and their ability to export. There is a reason they are taking actions to keep the RMB low versus the dollar (value wise).

They can make a bill as specific as they want.

People have been taking it seriously because there is real money to be made. Unfortunately all of those gains in prices are speculative, good luck once everyone decides it's time to cash out. Bitcoin can only survive at a high price if people decide to actually use it to buy things, which is such a negligible fraction of the current market.

Dude, bitcoin is a well defined protocol. All you have to prove is that they are exchanging bitcoins, a well defined action, and they can be prosecuted. I have no idea why you think this would be hard. Further, it's ridiculous to think that any legitimate large scale business could somehow widely accept an illegal currency and still hide it. The point is, bitcoin fails if the common man no longer uses it, which they won't if all their stores stop using it.

The problem is that in a little over 3 years the difficulty is doubling again. Mining even with ASICs now takes a long time to even hit even. Another issue is that as soon as mining becomes popular enough the sheer number of people will kill the profitability, defeating the point.

I'm not talking about stopping it completely, I never said that. I said that it wouldn't be used for legitimate business, which is 99% of commerce. That's the issue that Bitcoin can never avoid since all governments directly control commerce laws (and no legitimate business is willing to face massive fines, legal penalties, and bankruptcy to support Bitcoin).
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:15:02
Agreed. More and more demand pushing prices up which creates more demand. 99% of bitcoin right now is investing. Investing into the hope that more people invest into it. Sadly it isn't even close to economically for buying goods with high fees and very few merchants adopting it outside niche stores.
@_date: 2013-02-03 01:40:32

I dunno, you have a lot to factor. Legal protection both local and internationally, roads for commerce, guaranteed infrastructure for your business to operate, rights for you and your employees, etc. People don't realize the luxuries a country like the U.S. provides employers compared to countries such as China where if the local officials, some corrupt wealthy person, or the government in general doesn't like you, you're screwed. They can shut you down, they can counterfeit, block you, threaten you with no legal recourse, etc. Without a functioning government it can be very difficult to operate a business.
@_date: 2013-05-31 10:15:14
I seriously doubt that.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:29:35
Hype is the primary fuel for Bitcoin's rise right now. SatoshiDice, Silkroad, and Mtgox are where over 99% of all transactions are taking place. This is not enough to sustain BTC in the long term, and it's simply too expensive/slow still to purchase in bitcoins for normal goods with conversion fees.
@_date: 2013-02-01 21:03:14
Yet another attempt to cash in on the hype of bitcoin gambling.
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:00:51
That's why it's just a $1000 gamble.
@_date: 2013-02-25 23:29:31
The problem is that it just spiked up over 100% in the past 2 months and suddenly hits this wall. This is not a stable situation and investors are either going to push forward or drop it fast since it is so unpredictable right now.
@_date: 2013-05-04 17:09:43
They don't want the BTC period, because they can't control it. The USD they can control by purchasing it from exporters directly so that its supply is extremely limited inside the country (which is exactly what they do by also having a maximum daily USD withdrawal in the country). This limit of USD inside the country forces people to use RMB and devalues RMB in a very specific way, keeping costs competitive enough to export goods cheaply. With BTC you can import and spend as much BTC as you want instantly into the country.
@_date: 2013-05-05 14:36:22
Oh yeah I was reinforcing what you said.
@_date: 2013-02-21 01:06:53
It won't ever come close to that unless it dramatically picks up adoption among sellers, simply because people will try to sell their bitcoins long before then, driving demand back down.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:48:36

It has built in error detection.  I'm not saying it's guaranteed but it is a bit forgiving.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:19:25
Bitcoin first needs to stabilize. Anyone using bitcoins for selling goods would have gone bankrupt if they didn't cash out in time (losing out on a month or more of income).
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:53:14
Do you seriously believe that the rise in price is due to demand in usage and not in speculation of future value? That would mean that SatoshiDice and SilkRoad represent a billion+ dollar industry.
@_date: 2013-03-15 03:14:55
This is the biggest hurdle with getting higher. Most of bitcoin's value right now is backed by speculated future value. If that future value doesn't fulfill the expectations of current speculators (if it stagnates for an extended period of time), it may push back down bitcoin's price.
@_date: 2013-02-02 21:57:18

@_date: 2013-03-08 02:40:20
In the same respect I could ask you the same question.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:55:56
The USD has its value because the US government gaurantees it and forces by law debt to be able to be paid in it. A currency that can pay off debt to the most powerful country in the world makes it very valuable. The same can't be said of Bitcoin, which has no owner and no endorsements yet, especially not from the U.S., Eurozone, or China, all of which have strong monetary policies and controls over their currency.
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:55:03

If it flatlines a lot of people may dump it since they only bought it on speculation with the intention of selling later on. No sense in holding all your investments if it isn't achieving any significant gains. Bitcoin now more than anything needs a heavy push into real use.

You are completely missing his point. Bitcoins were a gamble regardless. Just because they succeeded doesn't mean you are smart, it just means you are lucky.

@_date: 2013-04-23 19:59:29
As I said before, it will likely succeed for a long time in the black market. I am talking about adoption among the majority and businesses. Your average joe isn't going to go out of his way to use an illegal currency on the black market instead of walmart and amazon.com.

I just don't see your average person who knows little about computers beyond e-mail and facebook to go to all that work just use an alternate currency when dollars work just fine. Even now it makes absolutely no sense to use Bitcoins for purchasing goods beyond SilkRoad and extra anonymity (which already exists unless you are trying to hide from the government transactions, which can be good but not something most people care about) simply because the transaction fees are way too high compared to USD.

Your average joe that goes to Walmart and doesn't care much about his monetary privacy against governments will go back to using fiat currency quite easily, and I'd love to hear the explanation for how any legitimate company would still be willing to deal with an illegal currency when doing such a thing would get them fined into bankruptcy and possible criminal prosecutions. Bitcoin has its place forever in black markets and under the table transactions where security and anonymity is key, not for mom and pop shops down the street.

What's crazy about bitcoin is that it keeps bucking back up because people are convinced it will go up more again. It's extremely hard to tell what will go on, especially now that the entire world is going nuts trying to get in on it.

Governments most certainly can stop it for legitimate commerce. As soon as there are fines and legal penalties involved with doing commerce with Bitcoin no company in America will use it because none is willing to face bankruptcy and litigation for the sake of using a digital currency.

The issue is if the total supply of usable bitcoins becomes, for example, 1,000 bitcoins in circulation, then some dude recovers an old wallet with 2,000 bitcoins and proceeds to destroy the global economy when he tries to sell them all.

I don't think you realize how easy it would be to ban bitcoin. You simply have to make it illegal and no legitimate registered business would deal with it, leaving it to the black market (and who is going to use a currency that won't work on amazon, walmart, anywhere legitimate?). And trust me, if you threatened the federal reserve and governments's main source of power and control, they will do something about it.
@_date: 2013-03-24 21:40:48
The problem is however that the transaction fees make that not economical and since a debit card would strip the best benefits of BTC, it would remove most incentive for people to use a debit card.

They still wouldn't let their citizens do it. You have to understand how important currency manipulation of the RMB is to them. If they lost control of that it'd have a tremendous impact on their ability to export goods to other countries. There is a reason why they've been buying so much foreign debt to keep their RMB down in value.

That's still all backed by cash. My biggest question is, what would it take to get your average joe to move over to bitcoin? Your average person isn't trying to encrypt their transactions or care about anonymity. Further more, they are very much happy with the the dollar and are not tech savvy enough to openly accept a "cryptocurrency" replacing their cash.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:20:45
The difference between a gamble and an investment in this context is that with long term investments you'd need either the economy to collapse or the government to collapse (basically a wide diversity of companies to become bankrupt and/or bonds unable to be paid by the government) in order for your investment to lose most of its value, which is an extremely unlikely event compared to bitcoin's chance of crashing, which has already happened.
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:54:35
This is scary. What worries me is a lot of people are seeing this spike and are dumping everything into it. What this means is that when the market saturates and stops climbing, people may freak out and bail.
EDIT: To the people thinking I am literally scared due to losing my rent or something, I meant that it's scary how fast it could dive. All my bitcoins are from mining done on the side, no actual money of mine is at risk.
@_date: 2013-02-26 10:23:35
My whole point is that it is unstable, read my OP...
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:01:56
That's why I specifically said, **legitimate business**, as in the only place you would be spending bitcoin is in some back alley or on the deep web. This is hardly where we would want Bitcoin to be.

You're better off just spending a dollar on bitcoins one time, you'll end up making more money because you'll have a full dollar's worth of bitcoin increasing in value instead of a few pennies worth at a time.

But it isn't backed by anything but speculation and the black market right now. Fiat money has value because it has the backing of not only an entire nation and its economy but by law debt can be paid with it. 
Bitcoin will remain a pseudocurrency as long as it fluctuates 20-100% a year and is mostly used in speculation and the black market.

No? Laws can be specific to bitcoins (or Litecoins, or whatever else they specify). 


Except the major allure of this technology is in use for commerce. What's the point of even buying bitcoin if you can't spend it at any store you shop at? Do you really think your average joe will bother with a cryptocurrency they don't understand if they can't even do anything with it that can't already be done with money?
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:24:24
While very awesome, please don't do this if you need to save money. If I am reading this right, the entire purchase price is the sticker price, which is a high markup to pay and on top you will still have to register your purchase etc (which means you still will have to pay taxes and lose any anonymity that comes with BTC).
@_date: 2013-02-25 22:48:00
It seems that half the people think it's a bubble and the other half don't, two walls are pretty much locking it in at $30 right now and not enough people are confident either way. The fact that it's stuck at such a perfect number shows that its price right now is entirely psychological, nothing else is really backing up its value (since it's not backed by gold or by a government it could potentially drop back down pretty hard).
@_date: 2013-02-21 09:17:54
Name calling won't change reality. What exactly do you think gives Bitcoins its present value other than speculation? And I said as of now, not in the future. No one knows with certainty what Bitcoin will be in the future, if anything.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:47:46
Except gold has inherent value as a rare element with practical applications. Bitcoin can be cloned infinite times, such as what was done with litecoin. If Bitcoin goes out of favor and some other currency takes over, the bitcoins lose all their value, regardless of how scarce they are.

Great incredibly vague explanation, it totally checks out. You're stating the obvious...it's like saying a stock is sure to rise for a company because people demand it, of course with demand anything will go up. That obvious fact doesn't convince anyone they should invest in it. How do you know demand will keep rising?

The total money supply of bitcoins is still only worth $200 million though. That's less than what the movie Skyfall has made so far and is about what a medium sized business is worth, which is negligible. To say they are making a "killing" is ignoring how little that still is when you start talking about a currency on the global market.

Also something people haven't really mentioned yet; many ASIC developers are having huge delays on their releases. It's suspected that they are holding onto the majority of the production and profiting off it until it no longer is economical. Basically you fund them to mine until it's more profitable to sell it. Some of the production is sent out though to keep consumer confidence.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:00:08
Until the countries responsible for doing this ban bitcoin so you can't get around it...
@_date: 2013-06-09 10:38:56
Bitcoin jumped up past $200 on pure hype. Everyone wanted in on the get rich quick scheme before it collapsed hoping to make a quick buck. Now it's readjusting to it's real value, which could keep going lower and lower. Perhaps some lingering hope of another boom is keeping the value up as of now; something that will dwindle with time. Bitcoin has real value because of its use on the black market, but that may not be enough to keep it above $100.
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:52:52
Who cares, videos don't mean anything when they can just delay it again. There are also rumors that they are just using the pre-orders to fund other things, which in that case just requires them stringing people along with anything.

No, I said the ease of it is the same. Both are alternate forms of payment, both are easy to ban when you have cash/credit to fall back on.
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:50:13
The problem I was focusing on is that no legitimate business will even touch bitcoin if it is illegal, simply because they don't want to lose their business license and pay millions in fines every time some one buys something from them. The use of bitcoins would be limited to either black market or foreign companies (assuming their country is not actively policing it). Considering the US, EU, and China along with others actively control their currency at least in those countries it is doubtful that any significant business would use it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:02:01

The $30 price is tied to nothing (backed by nothing tangible and gauranteed). It shows how tightly it is bound to people's emotions, knowing what Bitcoin is actually valued in even the next month is a fool's guess.

I'll be honest, I don't believe you since I can't find anything on it, even Wikipedia only mentions Silk Road.
@_date: 2013-03-07 21:54:50
The issue is that indisputably over 99% of all bitcoin transactions are currently in the form of speculative trading. That means that outside of SilkRoad and a few very minor alternative payment sites, Bitcoin has no use to back up its value. This makes it very volatile and very dangerous. Bitcoin could flop or skyrocket, no one knows yet.

@_date: 2013-03-01 08:28:45
I don't think of it that way. To me bitcoins are gambling, and anything I get from it is in large part luck. Similar to buying a lottery ticket. I don't do it for money and I certainly don't expect to get any money from it, that's just a fun bonus on the side.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:46:05

Frick man, I said it's as easy, not that it's the same thing. You are completely missing the point. I'll explain it very simply for you. If you want Bitcoin to become a standard universal currency, it needs to be usable by your average person in your average store. Make it illegal for stores and your average person no longer wants anything to do with it.

Pure hype, there are an infinite number of bitcoin clones that can exist in the future, further Bitcoin depends 100% on either actual use (which is almost non-existent since nearly all transactions are done on speculation) or speculation. As of now Bitcoin is nothing more than gambling and speculation, the only real thing giving it value right now.

Mostly hype and speculation. As more people hear about it more people want in on it, pushing the price up more and fueling the cycle. The question is where will it finally stop and what happens then? Adoption rates need to catch up before that happens, no one wants to sit on bitcoins that don't appreciate and can't be spent on main stores like Amazon or Walmart.

Speculation is the only thing giving this serious value right now, considering aside from drugs and niche websites that automaticaly convert it to the dollar you can't spend the bitcoin on anything. It has yet to fulfill the promises that are supposed to give it value. Yes, it has huge potential, but don't be fooled into thinking it's already proven itself as a long term viable currency.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:14:00
Only if it can retain demand. There is nothing inherently valuable about bitcoin beyond it's demand, since it can be cloned infinitely (such as with litecoin, etc).

What? It's called risk distribution, which regardless of the result you need to be doing. It's the same reason why I still have 2 coins (and by the end of month 4 coins) now instead of selling everything and also why I will be making a profit regardless of whether it spikes up or tanks, instead of having all my eggs in a single basket. It's very basic trading strategy and your ignorance of it only serves to emplify why I think you aren't that intelligent (or just very oblivious).

The closest parallel I can think of is investing in a startup. They haven't proven themselves yet, they don't even have a product out yet, but you might be willing to pay to get in on it early because they might hit it big, or just fail completely like most usually do.

Yes but what is going to drive that up? Pulling numbers out of your ass is fun but without hard evidence you are just telling me your hopes and dreams.

The rule is to never buy when everyone else is buying. There is a buying frenzy right now, this is a huge red flag.

What? Is it wrong to discuss intelligently what is going on? Bitcoin value is based almost entirely on emotion right now, it's very dangerous, you'd be blind not to see this. I already sold my 4btc and have 2 saved in case it keeps climbing.
@_date: 2013-02-03 02:22:12
The problem is that you have speculation and silkroad driving the bulk of Bitcoin's value (basic supply and demand). In the future speculation will likely drop (since it won't be swinging 50% in 2 weeks like it just did now) so demand for bitcoins will need to rise significantly through usage. Either Silkroad has to massively expand or some other retailer has to or Bitcoins won't increase much in value.
@_date: 2013-03-24 21:12:52
The main issue is that Bitcoins are not very liquid (as far as transferring to USD or other fiat currencies). This creates high transaction fees which make it not economical in the sense that you would never do this for normal transactions. On top of that, a debit card essentially discards the main benefit of Bitcoin, anonymity. These two reasons kill any significant demand for debit cards. (although demand does exist for Debit cards that use BTC, just not under these conditions)

It's long term valuation.
@_date: 2013-02-03 04:23:22
Yes but as soon as it competes with national currencies it will be banned or severely restricted. You have to remember that a nation's strongest and most influential economic tool is control of the money supply and interest rates. You try to take that away from the U.S. or European Union and it just won't happen, they will stop it. The bigger issue though is that bitcoin is restricted to and has stayed primarily in both speculative markets and the blackmarket for over four years and it will be extremely difficult for it to move beyond a highly specialized usage.
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:48:43
Actually that's a very good comparison and how I see bitcoin possibly becoming (at least on a larger scale). Bitcoin has a niche it is already filling, namely as a black market currency. However since it has a direct competitor that is legal and serves the same function for 95% of the general public, it won't reach beyond a niche use.
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:00:51
Bitcoin's outcome is completely unknown. There usually is a reason why people say "don't panic please!!" and it usually isn't a good reason.
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:32:15
Exactly. The guy who laughed is not stupid, he knew the risk. The guy who bet all that money is only stupid if he thought it was a guaranteed return.

They don't have to pay out to shareholders if it is considered part of advertising, since they can't profit off themselves.

Reality doesn't matter, only perception, that is the whole point. The only thing people saw in the news was this freakout over an issue with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-02-21 01:04:02
And actively backs it both as a form of debt payment and as the standard currency both for the world and 300 million americans. The biggest issue with bitcoin right now is that it is backed almost entirely by speculation, with actual payment of goods being a fraction of a percent of total bitcoin transactions.

Couldn't one group still run multiple pools adding up to 51% and fork all the pools? What's stopping one group from going through the motions and forking anyways.

What research have you done?
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:01:03
I don't think you understand what I am saying. In America if someone screws him over, you sue him and are compensated. In other countries the business may not even be registered, and good luck trying to sue them. If they are connected, then you have no hope. Even Google got shafted by China when they decided to block them and prop up Baidu.
@_date: 2013-02-20 07:28:08
People are laughing but only a month ago it was near single digits. Something whose value is almost entirely based on speculation isn't going to maintain value when people start seeing its price drop off dramatically. People will continue selling in fear of it dipping further, pushing it down to potentially single digits.
@_date: 2013-01-06 00:53:25
If you are serious about something as important as becoming a major currency, any major unknowns are a problem.
@_date: 2013-03-01 11:15:06
The problem is currently no government in the world would be willing to give up their strongest fiscal tool, money supply control. Especially the EU and USA, whose currencies are the backbone of their economy. They'll ban it before it replaces and significantly offsets their currency. And yes, it's very easy to kill off bitcoin for the public if you made it illegal for any legitimate business to use it in place of money. People will gladly dismiss this, but I have seen not a single argument address this issue other than "oh no they won't do that" as if a country like the US would willingly give up on the dollar.
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:09:40
But if you get audited you have to prove it. Good luck with that and being charged with tax fraud.
@_date: 2013-05-30 22:11:11
Your average joe is definitely not going to bother with a digital cryptocurrency when Walmart, McDonalds, Amazon, and every other legitimate business won't accept it (since they are definitely not going to stick their necks out and be fined into bankruptcy all the sake of bitcoin). To think that the government can't restrict bitcoin for most commerce is delusional.
@_date: 2013-02-03 01:34:55
Does that take into account a market saturated with ASIC miners?
@_date: 2013-02-03 16:49:07


Of course, your bank account has one thing in it, cash. Cash is the only thing in America that is legally forced to be accepted for all debt. That is what makes it so strong, it can pay for any debt regardless of whether a debtor wants to accept it or not. The situation you are talking about is a moot point because FICA prevents this very issue, that's how strongly the dollar is supported.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:12:38
Just because someone is scarce doesn't make it valuable. It needs continued demand. The worry exactly is what the hell happens after Bitcoin peaks and the speculative crowd dumps their inventory?
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:34:57
What? All they have to do is pass a law or amendment to ban its use for purchasing and all legitimate business in the country would stop using it else be fined into bankruptcy. A currency relies on being adopted, and a country can control what businesses can and can't do.
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:05:34
What's your point? Taxes are rarely given up once they are put in place. Representatives do not willingly give up revenues and the accompanying benefits ever.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:39:39
That's not the issue, the concern is that this vulnerability exists for everyone since any country's government can do the same as China. I don't know about you but it'd really suck not to be able to spend Bitcoins in my own country.
@_date: 2013-02-04 01:03:26
A processor, whether in a GPU or CPU, is designed take various instructions (add, multiply, etc). An "ASIC" in this case only can do a single instruction that it does incredibly well, but that is all it can do.

It's not about familiarity, it's about all the speculators who are buying bitcoin on emotion.

They would effectively be back to what they are being used for now. I never said otherwise. There is a huge difference between a black market commodity and a full fledged nationally used currency.

I have no idea how you expect the average person, your average joe who just wants to go to the local walmart or buy on itunes or amazon, to go out of his way to use an illegal currency on a blackmarket website just for the sake of using bitcoins instead of cash/credit.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:09:05
Bitcoin is like penny stocks, extremely risky and definitely unknown territory. No one knows for sure if or when it will crash again, it's more of a gamble than an investment and should be treated as such.

You'd make far more money just buying bitcoins.

Same goes for you.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:43:39
What it comes down to is the return based on the risk. That's why you vary your investments between stocks, bonds, etc based on what returns to risk you're willing to deal with. Bitcoins are so out of the realm of known factors that it is gambling simply because it is a wild guess as to whether it would and will succeed. Bonds for example would require the collapse of the U.S. government to lose their value, which is extremely unlikely hence their low risk.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:41:21
Good luck. Chances are that most people who knew about bitcoins back then were savvy enough not to leave their information out in the open for anyone to go through. Which leaves a fraction of a fraction of old computers that might have it.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:11:37
It's still more expensive to handle bitcoins right now though...

I'm not saying it's bad or good, just curious what the side effect is.

Trusted creditors will be used as an intermediary. You pay them in BTC to charge your card and then they promise to pay vendors using your information from your charged account.  Essentially like a debit card.
