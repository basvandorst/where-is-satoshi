I think I would be more worried about my wallet being hacked than an Exchange going under

Right, I understand an exchange wallet is just as likely to get hacked as a private one, but the distinction I was making is that it would be the Exchange's coins, not the user's coin, that gets stolen. I am of course making that assumption. I could be wrong.

I think that figure is relative to one's income, but overall agree.

If I had that kind of coin I would have the most secure form of storage I could possibly get. I'm just not sure I see the big worry over a couple hundred/thousand bucks.

I've been curious to know this too. Like who owns what amount of BTC. Obviously that's personal but it would be neat to associate the comments in this subreddit with actual investment.
I'm not even to 1 BTC. And for the people saying who cares about owning a whole coin, I want to just so I don't have to do the mental math and can just see that the amount is the same as the value I hold

I think I'm just gonna set up sell orders once it crosses a certain threshold. And as the price keeps rising, my sell floor will keep rising too, so I won't sell at the peak, but I'll hopefully sell close
