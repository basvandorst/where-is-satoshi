I don't know if there's such but, if there was a trezor/ledger usb that use fingerprint scanning to login would be best.
Add other people as secondary logins. If primary login does not confirm life in 18 months, then assumed dead. If secondary user tries to login, primary user is sent email to physically login within 18 months to confirm alive. Failing which, primary is therefore dead and when secondary tries to login after 18 months, will have access.

And they think if the world moved to crypto all problems will be solved. Yet they can't answer a simple question, in the world of crypto how will government fund billion dollar projects like roads, water, energy etc
I like crypto but let's be realistic about problems ahead and let's find solutions.

If i convert my usd to yen, i guess i could say i am usd inflation protected by your argument, but the truth of the matter is i am not inflation protected.
Example, if bag of tomatoes cost usd2 and there is 10 bags on the market every month, then suddenly supply drops for what ever reason to 6 bags per month, and people still have money to buy. What will happen is price will increase to usd2.20 per bag. That price change there is inflation. Whether i used usd or btc in this example it will still be inflation. If goods eventually get priced is btc u still get hit by inflation.

I honestly think we don't need bitcoin, and we probably will never need it. Key problem is and becoming more centralised.

People have been sold a sales pitch and they think they understand when they dont. Its amazing even those who think they understand, including technicals, they really don't understand. When you hear things like crypto is inflation protected you know bs is happening.
