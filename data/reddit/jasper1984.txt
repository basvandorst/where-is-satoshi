The investment of non-attacking bitcoin users would be ruined too. Basically the entire ecosystem could turn upside down, with bitcoin holders fighting *for* the centralized guys. I mean, their assets would be at risk too. It makes the entire defense of the thing political. PoW would be very expensive for that little technical protection against centralization imo..


CPUs are ASICs for general purpose computing. My point is, if mining isnt a very particular case of general purpose computing, then the ASICs could be general-purpose-computing devices, i think that would lead their sale and distribution. Whereas current mining processes dont have any mechanism at all promoting sale rather then using the miners themselves. Also, even if CPU and ASIC performance are merely closer, this means a smaller margin for development of ASICs.


Yeah.. that is a potential problem. That said, having both CPU-aimed and ASIC, diversifying the miners, does help. (at the cost of complexity) Besides, CPUs going 100% makes an infected computer stand out more, and botnets arent really our responsibility. PoS 'mining' doesnt suffer from it either.

Scripts are basically just programs.
As for complicated.. You can send money already right? The way it would appear to users is basically you get a script address, which is basically a normal address,(probably starting with an 's' or something) and you send coin or messages too it. *Good* scripts would be standard, well known, otherwise you'd have to know what you're doing or get scammed.
Once standard, you only would have to know what messages to send to it, and that would be what is documented. In the above case:
* Simply send 1.1X to the (script)address given to reserve the money for the payment.
* The seller will then send the package. Once you have it and are happy with it, you send the message 'accept' to the address. (there would be a gui for it) You would get 0.1X back(incentive) and the seller gets X.
* If you are not happy, or nothing arrives you of course first give the seller to chance to fix it or explain. If that doesnt work, you send the message 'destroy' to the script, upon which the script destroys its, and deletes itself. You lost your money, but the sellers effort was for nothing, there is no incentive there.(Actually this is too weak, i should have put money of the seller at stake too.)
* If you wait too long, the 1.1X is sent to the seller. Perhaps it is good to have a 'extend' message that the buyer can send to get more time. (Hmm, infact 'extendforever' would *also* be better than destroying it)
* If a decent seller feels he has failed, he probably does not want to anger the buyer, so he can send 'refund' that sends 1.1X back to the buyer.(which also deletes the script)
This is probably close to **the** most basic way to achieve a low trust relation between sellers and buyers.
Hell, you might only know to send 1.1X and then 'accept', you need only learn about the 'destroy'/'extendforever' options *if* the seller fails to deliver, and the whole system is designed to prevent it. Thats probably how you dont know about the complicated legal shit like TOS, because it is there for recourse if things go wrong, disincentivizing abuse, not for continual use.
Edit: not even 'accept', the seller would send you a message about it.. Of course if you dont know what 'accept' means they might scam you because of that, so the word 'accept' should be something like 'happy_with_result'' or something..

Really, the estimate of the level of security seems determined by the chance people feel things would be found out if insecure/malicious. As wel by the chance people think malicious actors of skill will attack.
I mean, as opposed to the estimate that things have been checked by people you trust.
I kindah do wish i knew better how well things like source code, correspondence to binary^\[1\] , program behavior^\[2\], javascript websites put out, stuff that goes on on the network is patrolled.
\[1\] projects like [gitian]( make this automatic, binary correspondence checking should be easy in package managers of the future.. \[2\] I think stuff bounces off [MAC]( which would noticible. Note that stuff like watching program behavior wont see inactive backdoors, necessarily.

That is a bit simplistic, there is the long range attack, where someone long in the past with a reasonable amount of coins just pretends that he happened to mine all the blocks.(think you can solve it by requiring the PoS mining to involve large fractions the stake, and possibly by mixing with PoW)
And there is the 'nothing at stake problem', where there is not really anything stopping you from PoS mining all the different variants of blockchains.([slasher helps](
Of course, it is really an open problem to figure out the best way to do this stuff. Frankly it is nutty to call it ['needless re-engineering']( Really though the bitcoin developer are steering a 10G$ ship and are very cautious about it. Hopefully the caution does not go to their heads.

Ethereum contracts will be able to do that functionality, decentralized, [including the website]( infact a [running democratic DAO]( that can decide on its own code, has already been run on the PoC5 testnet.
Of course running stuff on ethereum cost ethers, but it is probably an acceptable cost for the forseeable future.(probably there will be a Ethereum 2.0 against for instance scalability reasons) There are some ways to cheapen it like having people submit solutions to problems and contracts merely check them. Also [figured this]( but significant kink in that ideas armor it seems.
With DHTs(files stored by their checksum) the web pages may even be inexorably locked by the contract. This is because users find these pages via a namecoin-like contract, and the DDAO can be limited insofar how that can be changed.

Insider trading is made possible by the power than having the information on the inside is. Being on the inside of something like that correlates very well with wealth too.
Note that i *do* feel dubious about placing regulation when it overly a role of citizens as dependent on a single authority. The problem it is difficult for citizens to make a network in which they would be informed of things that could affect them, and actually use that information. For instance since people have only so many supermarkets in the neighbourhood, its customers would really have to change untrustworthy supermarkets, or people will run out of options between them. I dont see that sort of resolve in people.
I *really* dislike some pampering things. For instance, sure, they should make seatbelts mandatory, people did not get the point. But isnt the point made yet? It has *drastically* reduced the chance of injury and death. Shouldnt at some point citizens be the one to choose for themselves that not wearing seatbelts is stupid?
Maybe that is not the best example. But the problem with the approach is that it essentially assumes zero progress. Of course really, we get little progress because of how societies work inherently. Patching up with rules/regulations might 'fix' some issues short-term but has zero shot at the long term, and it might hamper movements that would solve it..(Of which bitcoin is quite potentially one)
@_date: 2014-10-26 00:18:33
The checksum doesnt help 100%, even in the case the checksum is *not* broken, and the pubkey badly broken. The reason is that the first time you use it, you send the real public key with it onto the network, but sending it on the network doesnt equal bitcoin being securely spent. If it is *badly* broken, an attacker could sniff it when the transaction is not on a block yet, and create a competing transaction.
I dont think it is that likely that the pubkey crypto will get broken though. But then, if you're putting large amounts in, a *tiny* chance is enough to make you protect it. It should be automatic, though. And afaik, it doesnt really cost you transaction costs any, so it makes sense to change address all the time. Havent really done it, dunno which clients have a good interface for that? Feel like i am missing something, though, what was that 'wallet backup lasts only 100tx' thing again..
Changing all the time might mean communicating new receive addresses all the time? That means you need security in that communication.
makes a good point about being safe against a potential lack of entropy in your generated keys.

Its just little 'ol me :p I mean the math is fairly simple i just wanted to be overly specific.
You are totally right that people that all flock to the same thing are (ir)responsible. It is a bad idea to do what they are doing even if CEX was trustworthy.(the EFF or something) I mean they might be hacked, they might not be as trustworthy in the future...
The argument that CEX might not be trustworthy for this now shouldnt even be neccesarily, but it is *an* argument for not all flocking there.. Also giving CEX 51% is a *rather* high level of trust, refusing that isnt exactly an accusation at them. Its like not giving the keys to your car to a stranger, it doesnt mean you are fearful of strangers.
Still leaves open if CEX could do that based on the feature fanofteawork suggests. Even 40% is ridiculous, i mean [looks like two parties]( already have &gt;50%, it is an alliance away from happening..(at least they're still pools..) Also i dont know how well you can know who is mining what, afaik if you happen to mine a coin alone, and put it in a wallet, that wallet is basically anonymous if your connection to the network is..(I dont know enough about bitcoin)
Aside: The problem uncertainty, fear and doubt about some danger, is that they're kindah often not actionable.. It may be pointless. In this case you can just switch pools though.

Anyone know how they intend to secure many sidechains, when the total activity on all sidechains is much larger than the bitcoin main chain?
Merged mining is *not* sufficient. Reason is that either 1)miners are not competive 2) miners have to run a full node on everything (does *not* solve the scalability problem for them) 3) miners use pools. Merged mining-on-all is a centralization risk!
In principle it is possible to do merged mining of some set limited number of chains. For instance you can be allowed to at maximum merged-mine two chains at a time, the nonce would simply list the chains. (not 100% sure how ASICs deal with that, think they can) *However*, then each chain gets much less difficulty, and if one miner 'owns'  a side chain, there are potentially lots of abuses.(well, i think that does depend on how the sidechain is implemented exactly)
[This Ethereum blog post]( the hypercube is just a particular chosen graph based on 3-way merged miners, each miner mines the main chain and two substates. There the suggested solution to lower difficulty on the substates is to tolerate them being owned by single miners, by having a mechanism where 'invalid portions can be reported' and a challenge mechanism to try ensure people can get at the data so they can find the portions that are invalid. If the attacker is forced to make valid blocks anyway, damage is basically completely avoided. He might be able to block transactions, but it is easy to add a mechanism to make transactions jump between substates, so attackers would have to attack all the substates at once to really succeed at blocking transactions.([might be inspired from my hanging blocks idea]( but not sure.(edit:i am sure the idea already existed in some form) Using the before and after state is much nicer than what i propose there. I suppose i didnt have the Patricia Trie in my head well enough...)
Edit: also the comparison with TCP/IP/HTTP... well bitcoin is a messy protocol, and people havent been able to duplicate it nearly well enough.(afaik the go version still doesnt work) Imo that takes on *too much* technical debt.(for instance the inputs/outputs thing, 'before and after balances' is better, Patricia tries better than that yet) I think existing holders is impetus behind this, but bitcoin technically itself deserves to be superceded, *not* extended/evolved. The coin can be transferred, a hard fork can really change anything in principle, and burn-over even more so. Of course, the issue here is that they're steering a giant oil tanker here, they have to convince everyone, and there is tech based off of bitcoin already.

Bitcoin development is far more centralized than Ethereum contracts/entities, *whoever* willing to develop the latter can just put it on Ethereum. Also, contract/entities should not be developed by a single organization, nor be 'vetted' by one and introduced as hard forks.. That is an important requirement, for me, at least.
And i also want some pushes toward decentralization of bitcoin foundation/association too. To me it seems to me that i shouldnt trust bitcoin foundation too much. For instance, i dont get how Brock Pierce got to be director.(maybe i should look into it)
For a hard fork to be like Ethereum more precisely.. it is very invasive. You have to get rid of inputs and outputs and basically do things the Ethereum way with a state. You also need a way to change from the one to the other, and afaik, this will break some stuff like colored coins, they have to have a transition too. [See also sjalqs comment](
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:20:37
I am not saying that there is no fix, i suggested one in the very post ;)
The issue with 'nothing at stake', well, the principle is that everyone mines all the blocks, so an alternative chain has the same speed of growth, and is never dropped.
Though is suppose reality is not exactly that way. If people got transactions in one and not the other, they have incentive to take the 'main' chain. Shops may even care about transactions of their customers too. Besides that, they is also some measure of loyality to the currency itself, however 'loyal' users still need to correctly identify the right chain.
Say the attacker has fraction `a` and fraction `L` is loyal, and assuming everyone can identify, then `a + (1-a)*(1-L)` is proportional to speed of growth of the attackers chain, and the main chain `1-a`.
The attacker wins is `a + (1-a)*(1-L) &gt; 1-a` → `a &gt; L/(1+L)` to win. Not correctly identifying makes `L` → `cL` with `c` the fraction they get it right. I think 'loyalty/identification' is largely about people configuring/setting up their software. Though i suppose double spends devalue the currency. At 80% identification and 90% loyalty, a&gt;45% probably initially identification more like 50%(no better than average) then initially you can run with 29%
'Corrections' where an attacking chain is identified themselves reverse transactions, of course.. Software could just put the transaction on both chains, then it is true whichever is choosen. (This whole loyality/identification is not an issue if the chain is being worked on in private anyway)
And there is the question if super-linear mining can be done by using 'little spurts'. Short attacks that get some of other peoples' blocks ignored in favor or your own, but dont neccesarily get spotted, other than potentially afterwards, using statistics.
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:59:39

A LED like that on a phone could flicker at speeds in the microsecond range, it might be possible to use the camera to detect it.(or an optotransistor, perhaps)

If you have more than 50% you get *all* the transactions without losing a block.(because you just overtake any from anyone else) So then you can block transaction without cost.
As long as the government or this party *usually* doesn't decide that particular accounts are to be frozen, the value won't really drop. And the shops/consumers also depend on the value of the bitcoin. There is potential for brinkmanship here, where the miner threatens to double-spend and crash value the system in exchange for 'protection money', or even as threat to stop development of a hard fork/burnover that would end the monopoly.

I never said it was the OS that was insecure. Compromise a program,(bug, malicious developer, malicious packager) typically, you got the entire usespace.. Mandatory access control isnt that widespread yet, really wish package manages would tackle configuring them. Even with MAC, a bug in there is not impossible.
Really think the best route to more security is to drastically limit the number of places where vulnerabilities might lie. Thats why the approach i suggest, and might even try do, is to use a secondary computer where you can push the compromise between security and convenience much further towards security.
Your 'DIY' mentality is silly, btw. I mean, it is not like i am alone in wanting security, so i will tell people about this idea all i want.

It is perfectly consistent to consider what is out in the open 'fair game', while at the same time demanding not to be forced to put things out in the open, and disparaging people from putting things out in the open.
Infact, i think the distinction is not made enough. There is a difference between putting stuff online, and being recorded without your consent. I.e. the difference between putting stuff on facebook, others doing it about you, or being forcedly surveiled, like the NSA taps on the global fiber network, or the cameras hanging around. Or the cameras on peoples phones when they are not particularly being used. You dont know what is installed on other peoples' phones, the camera could be used all the time.

Hmm, some anti-micro transactions links behind there. However, how often have you clicked the upvote button? A lot.
And you can eliminate the mental overhead that it represents money by only charging a set amount per month, and dividing the income according to some algo. This is exactly what Flattr does, and of course something like ethereum will be able to do this.
I dont think the mental overhead is a problem *at all*, the problem is 1)getting easy flow in doing this securily.(click an up button) 2) getting people to set a decent monthly amount. Donations and tips are seen as 'charity', but really, someone did work for you, he just doesnt have *leverage* because of it.(or before it) You could call it leverageless payment. Or alternatively [gratipay]( named gittip)

You mean when he fails to succeed. The shooter could also succeed at murder and then say he was joking, and it was an accident. Those cases seem largely equal to me. Of course if it is in a street that isnt believable, if the 'target' was in a circus act on of those wheels, it may be perfectly reasonable.
Also if the murder succeeded, that may also correlate to having more evidence for a case. For instance if the (potential)victim flees into a forest, being chased, he shot, the body may be left, there may be blood left behind, which is later found and it is automatically a crime scene. As opposed to when he escapes, then there is little information, and the persuer can much more easily claim he was trying to simply catch the guy.
I basically agree with what you said about sentences. I dont think the desires of victims shouldnt play too large of a role in how the guilty are handled. However people often come back in a hateful mood and basically demand that the justice system serves some role as revenge. I dont think it should do that, but the system has to be stable against it, and while dealing with the victims well helps, i expect sentences will have to reflect it aswel.

CPU mining using a decent amount of the CPU power of a computer risks the computers' infection, because it is a clear and annoying symptom of being infected.
And it is kindah lame to wave away all potential ASIC-resistant as not being real. Some of the ideas coming from Ethereum seem to come fairly close.
That said, i would not dissuade bitcoin from fixing its pooling problems. Btw .. afaik  inherently, you need to run a ful-node. However, can you have *one* computer running full-node, connecting to core, and the rest just mining?

Basically `block.parenthash` determines what bit of the data to focus on and `tx.data[..]` contains 'the other branch' of each node of the merkle tree.
What if multiple people have the data, wouldnt it be a race to get to the blockchain first in that case? People with a good chance to create the next block, or maybe in a good network position with respect to those people would stand a better shot at getting paid for holding the data.
Its a proof of concept. And probably the above is fixable. For instance by just giving a probability of payout, or only allowing a particular other party to use it.(at the cost of adding randomness, making it more specific)

The advantage of light is that you could probably cook up some 'scopes', and aim at the source you want the signal from. Even just selecting the right light would help.

I dont at the moment.. But the short of it is that a script address has all the things a regular address has, and is governed completely by its code. It also has some data storage. It may(but doesnt have to) have special relations to non-script addresses. It could be anything including the abilty to use four-out-of-five to vote to change the code, for instance.
Maybe i dont understand fully either. I dont understand why the system might need 'contracts' when transactions could create the script and talk to them fully.
I dont know how to script with the thing yet, but if you have a buyer paying X for something. The seller would create a script(a standard one, for trust) that:(only)
1. Allows the buyers to pay 1.1*X
2. Allows the seller to refund(send it back)
3. After some time, the buyers to either destroy all the coins, or send X to the seller, and 0.1\*X back to himself as incentive.
4. After a longer time, it is sent to the selller. Perhaps &lt;0.1X is also sent to the buyer, but less, in order to compensate for making the seller wait. You could also slowly have the incentive follow some smoother curve.(but it should initially be  flat..)
If the seller needs the deal to be more trustless, he puts a little stake in the script aswel. Which he gets back if he succeeds or refunds, but not if it is destroyed.
Note that, if there is a special 'destroy coin' command the system could make mining more profitable so that particular way of destruction doesnt overly decrease the money supply and break inflation plans. (Also it destroys coins, not value in the community. Assuming the value of the total of coins stays the same, the value is just spread around. However i dont think that is *exactly* the case)
Of course, with a trusted mediating third party you can have more beneficial rules, where seller or the third party can refund, and the buyer or the third party can push through the coin to the seller. If such a party can be found, that much more likely for 10k$ :) Here the system can ensure the mediator cant run away with the money.

You can review the scripts too, probably a bunch of standard ones exist, and you dont need to pay a laywer anything. What if you buy a 20$ gizmo, you cant pay for a lawyer then. The smaller contracts are the more important ones in cryptocurrencies.. For some reason people seem attracted to 'issuing stocks' and stuff instead of the tiny shit, like bounties, kickstarters, the escrow above..
Yeah, it *sounds* more complex. But the scripts arent part of ethereum, just feed them in. The script language isnt that complex, and some of the parsers to make writing them easier are completely separate from it. Besides bitcoin *has* a scripting language.
Hell, contracts are probably typically much more complex than those scripts would be, and then you might need a lawyer to get them enforced.. I bet if someone explains a contract, like a TOS here, its gonna be much more complicated.
Edit: the above explains it *fully*, and enforces itself, unlike all the shit you use where you'd completely have find out what legal shit you have been using for years.(edit if there is a problem) Which may possibly be used against you maybe.

But isnt making new versions potentially problematic? AFAIK:
* The scale of a bitcoin has a big effect on security.
* If new versions succeed, older versions may devaluate, or something?
* Conversely, could a large number of versions make it hard to popularize new coins with new ideas?
Frankly, i'd prefer if the ideas for features were pooled together, and then seen which can be implemented in one coin. It avoids some of those issues.
Hmm, maybe there could be a 'terminate' option for your coins, basically you'd provably destroy the coins under some name, so that perhaps *potentially* a newer version could figure out how to use that to create coins. Basically you'd be able to go from one coin to the other, the earlier coin would have greater or equal value as the newer one.
That said, there are too many IFs and unknowns in my thinking about this though.

Stuff to look into.. Do realize that that looks completely inscrutable to me currently... I dont even know if i have to do a transaction, or if there are ways to send you data that allows you do to do the transaction.
Compare to the simplest case, where you could just give me an address, and i could use the client would get me the code, you'd see if it is some standard variety, maybe read it, if it has been discussed. Then i could simply send to the address. Simply because bitcoin can do it doesnt mean it is neccesarily proficient enough at it? I mean in ethereum it looks to me that the script to implement this is really simple, not requiring nearly as much explanation i see on the bitcoin wiki.
Btw lack of gui might be due to bitcoin-qt being [a reference implementation]( It would seem to me that the most popular client shouldnt be a reference client :) Those multiwallet pull-requests look like they were really active ftr.

Unlikely and relatively easily mitigated, if you ask me.
1. Violent criminals could do this today. I suppose they do, at ATMs.
2. If it happened with any volume, deniable cryptography can hide which accounts you have. Criminals dont have the resources to determine who owns which address.
3. From what i heard bitcoin can do multi-signature accounts.
4. You could have an arrangement where movement of coin at a particular address triggers people to look if you are allright.

Presumably is is possible to have a bitcoin where any transaction of B bitcoins at the receiver costs Be^kt and B(e^kt -1) is send.. elsewhere.
One 'elsewhere' could be some 'constituancy' based on initial public keys, and people sign each others keys to show they're a person.(according to some rule maximizing difficulty making people up..) It might be hard to ensure avoiding people with multiple though, and it is unclear what to do with offenders.. Put on offender list, banish? how badly? At least take away the ability of their public key to do any 'showing keys correspond to people'.
Not clear what to make votable things as constituents. You could just put the coin in their wallets, and promote donation, or you could have votes and some more centralized wallets, but they're likely be able to make arrangements to get the coin anyway.
I think it is overconfident to think bitcoin is up to that now, and dubious if the constituancy can be defined with not too many people having more than one accepted public key. ...And *everyone* needs *secure* public key devices...

It could also be a 51% attack or something, applied only to MtGox, to make it look like it was them, giving more time until people realize what is going on. The response from MtGox doesnt seem like it though.
I am confused by the constant 'withdraw from MtGox'.. you *exchange* there? Or do people actually manage their wallets there and their wallet simply doesnt function, and so you cant use it at any exchange. Because otherwise, if MtGox doesnt send you money, maybe others will.
Edit: Distinguish: MtGox:
* Manages wallets for people, i.e. if it doesnt work it is something wrong with the bitcoin system?!? Check the blockchain?
* Doesnt have enough money =&gt; just go to another exchange. Not enough there either? Bitcoin value likely to fall.
* Doesnt have enough bitcoin, =&gt; again go for another exchange.. Bitcoin value likely to rise.

Believe at that point, they didnt have that many cell towers. Point is, it wasnt really the mobile phone technology used today, which uses highly sensitive and high-power cell towers to talk to relatively low-power mobile phones.
Also, it is apparent that the infrastructure of cell towers and people already having phones was not there then. In contrasts, all the internet infrastructure is here now, it only need to be developed.
If is bitcoin succeeds, it is because the existing stakeholders driving it. I.e. bitcoin holders, people who build on it like Counterparty, Namecoin and Mastercoin. But i think bitcoin has too much technical debt. It is a bit of a plug, but the Ethereum approach seems *much* better to me. Additionally, the bitcoin-owners-stakeholders, *can* actually use that approach of development, they could use burn-over, maybe even side-chains could be used to upgrade.

Ethereum has 'gas' which you buy with ethers, is used up with computation, memory use, storage. Once it runs out, the whole action is reversed. The gas is still burned up though. If it doesnt run out the remainder is refunded as ethers. This protects everyone. Clients running the code never run forever, senders of transaction can set an upper limit on cost, and validity does not depend on code execution.(this helps miners) Also, this way, contracts dont need to do math about it either.(It used to be contracts in charge of computation costs)

Note: you have press a button to actually download the public keys..
Tor and bitcoin use public key crypto too. To be honest i am a bit confused how they can get away with such short public keys.(An bitcoin address is essentially a public key)
About this: all those public keys and identities onlines should be fetchable from a sort of P2P network as needed, without identifying who is getting that on who.(otherwise they know who you're talking too) For instance you'd enter your email address, pubkey, reddit account and bitcoin address into this. When people open up a bitcoin wallet, they may enter 'reddit paxton125', and they then can see your email address and bitcoin address. Well, of course you'd want control over what they can see then..

This ignores the definition of tipping, it is 'giving away currency' and it ignores that the actually tipped amounts are greater. That said. I find it hard to believe the average tip was 7$ on bitcoin, expect the numbers to be after deflation?(not deflation-compensated edit: apparently it is deflation compensated)
Also bitcoins fees are larger in value. Main issue the way tipping works is that it takes up a bit of space and, well, you cant say 'this is the reward', at best it is a token of appreciation. For reward any individual tip will be too small, maybe it works cumulatively.
Wonder if an ethereum contract can somehow 'have tipping/donations work as tipping, but only pay out decent amounts'. Basically tipping with the goal of ultimately employing people for the tip. 'Deep' blogs are a much better context for that reddit comments. Anyway you'd have to prevent tips in r/electronics only making jobs in r/pics, because it would be self-defeating to tip for the community that doesnt get the jobs. Really there is a myriad of potential problems.

I consider pooling and centralization of ASIC production a real risk. I think pooling can be decentralized without changing bitcoin.. Infact i see options for it.
The ASIC part seems tricky to deal with. Attempts are being made to make ASIC-resistant mining algos, and PoS-ASIC hybrid is also an option. Any solution should probably not totally screw over existing miners, but it will necessarily decrease the double-SHA part of issuance.
Of course such a change would be be 'evolutionary'.. Conservative, yes, but i have doubts about the evolutionary part of changes. Note that 'the economy' has a lot of leverage over the miners, because they decide whether not a hard fork is followed through. So if a central party grabs all the mining power, they may still not be able to do whatever they want in fear of pissing off users that give bitcoin value. A hard fork avoiding ASICs in general is difficult, but specific ASICs-used-for-bitcoin, that is trivial. However, there is the risk that the users get divided, and unable to co-ordinate a hard fork. It is just unacceptable to be that close to centralization.

I read about zerocoin, which was initially intended as modification to bitcoin, to make payments more anonymous. But according to some stories the bitcoin project didnt want it to appease authorities. The point is, that aspect of bitcoin itself seems to go the opposite direction as r/bitcoin. However it could also simply be that modifications are hard, for all i know.
I am not entirely sure how anonymous bitcoin can be made to be honest. The stories basically implied that bitcoins could be marked as tainted, and then government could basically force shops not to accept them. Are mined bitcoins and income from the fees anonymous? If they are there is a source of anonymous coin, which would cause problems with the system itself if blocked.

Wonder what would happen to the bitcoin value if one of the account services went belly up.. Either up, because there are now fewer bitcoins than people thought, so there is no supply. More likely down, due to less trust, and people who lost bitcoins in a wallet service are often(than not) not going to buy new ones.. So its not like if that happens others are not going to be affected..

[The issuance](a is pretty clear. 1X from initial coin buyers, 1.5X initially, 0.4X mined/year, about 5 years before coin supply is doubled, that isnt all bad.

Well, doesnt seem some PoS problems goes away easily, but i think those issues are lessened combining PoS and PoW. That may also be usable to ensure you need a large fraction in both to have a chance to dominate the system.
The bigger issue with Bitcoin in particular is that it might be difficult to convince people and/or bitcoin foundation to implement these things, and i dont entirely trust them. I.e. if they do decide to change stuff, people have to look critically at the approach and code. Basically we need *some* sort of way to decide about what direction to take with the source code that does not corrupt.

Also in ethereum scripts also have their own balance. It doesnt need a private key of course, because only the script can use it, by rule.(full nodes will reject not following the script.)
The script can of course be transacted with by addresses with private keys and other scripts. Some for private keys, or lists of private keys, those transactions entail control of the script.(like completely changing it)

Against theft you can encrypt wallets and have a big and a smaller one, you can store those encrypted all over the place. If you have enough coin that it matters you can use separate devices for security. Theft or loss needen't be an issue.
Bitcoin already has transactions that do stuff like escrow, multisig transactions, i still want to look better at it, but basically the bitcoin scripting language is a bit too limited. [Ethereum]( is nearly too limitless, but anyway, it could do things like not paying vendors that fail to deliver a product. There is at least one way to do it *without any third party*, basically sending coin which is then accessible by neither, the guyer can only either destroy it, or send it to the seller, and get a portion back too. That way sellers never get anything if they fail to deliver.
Point is, that the idea of cryptocurrencies is much bigger than currency, it can be used to mitigate aswel. You can even have scripts keeping your coin safe even if your wallet can be used arbitrarily by a thief. Basically the script has a balance which can only slowly be extracted from, however, there are a few other trusted people, listed by public keys than can empty it instantly if more of them decide to do so. The person whoms wallet was stolen would make a new wallet, simple contact those people and tell them to send it to that wallet.(Or even, a new script that has the same relation to the new wallet as the old one had to the older script)
Of course, Ethereum can do basically arbitrary things, and i think people will do dumb things with it. But there are enormously useful things that may be done with it, and those things would require zero employees.(Very efficient) For instance Namecoin can be implemented in it,  think storing and serving up data to people might be implemented.
I think, at least if transactions or DAOs arent obfuscated, it may demystify contracts and economics and improve the spread of knowledge on economics aswel. To programmers, at least, it might become much more accessible. This would help in making handling contracts and economics cheaper. Also, DAOs cant at all be flexible in how they interpret their rules. DAOs that have no way of such control by anyone cant do insider trading, unless it is specifically implemented.

Calling something Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt is a falicious argument. If you do a risk assessment lack of knowledge of the risk can increase the estimated loss. If you have two cases A,B but you are not sure which, and you have chances of something bad happen p(Bad|A), p(Bad|B), then the chance of P(Bad)=P(Bad|A)P(A) + P(Bad|B)P(B), the worst case pulls up the expectation of bad things happening.
You are simply saying the probability of GHash doing this is small, but avoiding arguments about why. Frankly the burden of proof should be to make it safe, people use the service for convenience, and they're allowed to jeopardize the system for that? Sounds like the basis of the NSA scandals, facebook etcetera.
Also, if this thing is good for a p2p coin, why are peers here distrustful? Cant we p2p pooling too to make it safer? (as [Chilltyperiod]( suggests) Of course, bitcoin was never even meant to figure out how to avoid concentration of wealth, so computing power could over-concentrate. Looks like the pooling is what causing the 51%, not a single entity in particular here, though?

Okey, you also question the definition of the word 'right'. You do realize your setting yourself up for dysfunctional discussions when bringing it up stepwise this way? I'd consider it a concept that legal constructs should defend for the sake of the society functioning for the good for people in general. In that case, showing bad things would happen is *an* argument for the right.^\* (edit: though it works at it from the wrong direction, a bit)
I can add more to the list of examples, for instance there are still homosexuals, transexuals, and people leaving/joining religions, that could be endangered if their activity wasnt anonymous.
Also [there is art. 19]( "through any media and regardless of frontiers", that includes anonymizing mediums like tor, freenet, retroshare, or (physical)bulletin boards and memory sticks build into the wall. (Article 29-2 is wide open to interpretation, probably the cost of getting many countries to actually sign it.)
I think amendment IV of the [US Bill of Rights]( papers means letters? I.e. they may not open your letters.
Privacy and anonymity are connected. If you can send data privately, but with metadata from who to who open, you can send a letter inside 'send to this other guy'. Using that you can make it anonymous.. In a digital environment privacy implies the ability to do anonymity. Even more so because public key encryption makes it impossible to open the letter.
Meanwhile if you dont use privacy of the connection to, say, websites for have anonymity, they may stil be able to see what websites you connect to. Which may mean they may be able to guess your opinions etcetera from that i.e. break your privacy anyway.
Of course anonymity can attract crime, this is obvious. It is telling though that the majority is drugs. Drug abuse should be considered a disease, though. And i suspect people do enrich their lives with drugs with control over it. The possibility of buying assasins or threatening people with it is more worrysome. Although it seems limited, how often this happens, i am still very annoyed when i [see one on lists]( lets hope it is a honey pot.. 
I wonder if a network like tor, but with an 'allowance' for spying is possible. Basically you can remove the privacy of like 0.1% of the messages, forcing the one trying to uncover illegal activity to focus on actual criminals.

As says it is nonsense. They can already access that shit in banks aswel, and blockchains may implement anonymity, like zerocoin does.
Governments hopefully will use blockchains, but for wholly different reasons' 
1. they dont have to manage logins them, just public keys. Oh and two-factor authentication is still possible, lots of tricks are possible.
2. this allows people to independently check whether transactions were handled properly. (for business-business and business-customer relations this helps too)
3. "code is law" and having them in a blockchain makes the code publicly auditable and publicly discussable.
4. Some things that used to be manually checked dont need to be anymore.

I see a RPi being sold doing it.. But cant find the distro, or loose SD cards with it itself.

Basically, bitcoin splits into two 'realities', the new one and the old one. If all shops only accept the new one, people would accept the coin from mined in the old one.

I am interested where they came from, but if they are criminals they're doing a damned good job giving presentations, making a whitepaper, documenting shit, writing a blog. Which all look good. Most criminals are lazy make a simple copy of existing coins, and tingle peoples emotions, or greed. Instead of, you know, basically tweaking every single aspect of the thing.
They specifically didnt use an existing scripting language for the reason of security. Stack languages are easy enough to understand, and afaik bitcoin already has a stack language that exists.

I wonder what determines the value of different competing. Bitcoin and many others derive their value solely as being useful as currency. Coins that can get beyond that, [*if* these DACs]( are possible, there may be coins that have intrinsic value in terms of some service. Like providing cloud storage.
They are also more attractive because the 'mining' would actually provide a useful service. So far, afaik(i have hardly looked at all of them) only for primecoin the mining does anything remotely useful.
There is the idea of ['colored coins']( too, which trades for gold. Afaiks they're essentially just vouchers though; bitcoin helps make sure they're authentic, the people behind it still need to be trustworthy in having the shit. Frankly all the same mistakes can be made.. You could make colored bitcoins for hideous constructions where the risk isnt clear, like, say, shitty mortages.
I do think we should realize the magnitude of it if this formed even like 1% of the worlds monetary system. For instance, these pools, cant they be missused? I mean we worried about 40% but it would seem to be that we should worry already if an alliance of two can break it.(cant the bitcoin protocol do p2p pooling?)

Bitcoin misses having a decentralized kickstarter, doesnt use any method of adding proof of stake for better security. Ethereum can definitely do those. The way it sounds to me, I'd rather use ethereum.. However, the alternatives are not so much explored to say that ethereum will be the one i will go to next.
Well, actually the above are only the tip of the iceberg of what ethereum promises. 
It may actually a bit involved to run a full node with it, but it makes a good case it can do secure thin clients if a single full node with a 0.1% of PoW or something exists. Besides, i dont *really* want to be isolated from those scripts even if that means running a thin client, or having a full client be a bit demanding. I dont want a barrier between me, and starting to do/look at those scripts. People have to keep an eye on the scripts that are used.. They can do bad things as wel as good ones..
Either way, we should avoid destroying the value of old coins that people got into wisely. If bitcoin cant be changed enough, it may have to be [burned over]( or something similar at some point.
So i think the question is if ethereum might include a system where it turns burned bitcoin for ether.

Wait, *how* do you see a transaction in an altcoin from a script? External IO? [I do *not* see it](
Besides, there are bunch of simple ones that would definitely would be used.. But I dont think bitcoin can do them.
For instance kickstarter, escrow between buyers and sellers, it can be done with no third party, *if* you're willing to destroy the coin if the seller(edit) doesnt pays. Or bounties. Difficult, because it needs a system to tell humans to check if it is forfilled. 
Possibly those would be in the form where the guy starting the kickstarter just starts a script, and people can simply send to the script addresss, and otherwise it is automatic. On one end, people dont even need to know its actually a script.
Still think a sort of categorization system of scripts should, and would exist. You'd be able to query a script address asking if there is documentation on that thing.

This data is rich in stuff, i mean you see people putting 'whole' numbers of bitcoin in it. If you look at it in terms of value in other currency,(*at the time*!) you may be able to see the whole numbers of dollars/euros etcetera, though that'd be vaguer due to exchanges..
There were faucets, right? Maybe the ammounts those gave are visible too. I mean if it was a small ammounts people may have ditched that money.. For instance the lines starting at 07/01/2010. If that faucet gave 50mBTC, well they werent being cheap considering what it is worth now :)

I tend to expect it is temporary too. Say a coin is mostly mined in the first five years, 'temporary' can still mean that quite a bit can be mined relatively democratically. Eventually you still still want ~2% per year inflation or something, so presumably if the coin was really popular that would still be enough for ASICs to eventually appear..

Most indeededly. Scripts can firstly do anything a person can, including holding assets. Unlike a person, scripts can be trusted to ..follow the script, unlike a person too, they can check things like public key signs etcetera without accessing computers, because they live in computers. This makes them really good 'third parties', if the first and second know what the script does very well.
The scripts are run in every full client, ethereum users will largely depend on lightweight versions that only check the things that affect their own transactions upto a point where the network secures it.
'Script' in ethereum "any program that does not cost too much space/time". Scripts pay fees for data storage, instructions used, and the transaction fees would still exist aswel. Nevertheless (despit trying to pen in what it is) i am still stumped by the scope of the concept.

If you send money/bitcoin and you're not getting bitcoin/money, cant tell what you should do. If the problem is just from money to bitcoin i suppose you can try sell them bitcoins. Otherwise, go to another exchange? Doesnt seem that big of a deal for bitcoin ultimately, i suppose it could bring a decline of value.

Ethereum is more efficient. The reason is that instead of 'inputs' which you look up on the blockchain, it keeps a state and addresses simply have a balance.
The contracts, however might attract usage that probably makes it need to do more per-person. It will have some price mechanism to tame it, though. If it were changed to 'just do ledger' it would be quite a bit more effective at it over-all. 
Maybe one way to get a 'just ledger' Ethereum is to ensure that gas price and gas costs, particularly for storage and contract creation are really high. Then it will have the whole contracts thing, but in practice it would be very minimally used.
That said, people are still looking at the scalability problem. Doing backflips helps the money be more useful.


If Bitcoin had a pre-sale, it would use dollars, because dollars are better as money that Bitcoin is. (or will ever be.)

Seriously, dont use web wallets.
Really the damn local-binary implementations need to be better, not that it is an excuse. One feature that'd be good is two-out-of-three accounts. The first two are held by the user, one he just keeps at a safe location, the other he uses, and then authenticates him/herself to, the service, that then provides the third signature. (also possible on Ethereum, infact, you can just let the authentication simply slow down transactions sufficiently)

There are lots of things licenses are good for, but obviously they can be used incorrectly and abused, and are.
Check [public good]( For instance license-to-practice medicine protects the common good by creating rules excluding bad doctors. Quota on fishing protects the fish stock common good. Land quality is (somewhat) protected by turning the common good in private goods via land ownership. Without copyright, data is trivially copied, a non-excludable public good, so to ensure enough of it is made, it is made excludable with rules.
It is *important* to have this terminology and ideas around, because people trying to abuse these mechanisms want to hide it. They try make copyright into private goods instead of club goods, so they "own it", i.e. "intellectual property. They pretend there are infinite fishes around; pretend it is a public good instead of a common good.
They generally try to muddle the *purposes* of turning public goods into club goods, and common goods into private goods, so their rights are more valuable. No doubt they have mostly succeeded, people see property as essentially an extension of the persons themselves.
I should of course mention that... well it is sort-of the case with my bicycle, and my laptop. People having privacy and seclusion in their own houses, letters etcetera is very important to civil rights.
Other point: A centralized exchange? We can't do better than that?! Edit: about software/data as club good. Copyright is for getting working business models. If you have a government contract, you have your business model, government should demand a free license.

I find it strange that i cannot say a thing that is common knowledge; that bitcoin doesnt scale easily.
If you grow the block size a thousand times, about a dozen full nodes will be run, and you might aswel do centralized banking. I am actually sure they can still increase the cap, and people will still be able to run full nodes. But they cannot increase enough for regular transactions.
Basically, you cannot expect small transactions to be worth enough to copy accross all full nodes, basically lower-security transactions are needed.(the security still has to "arrive in short order".) The Ethereum blog contains some ideas, for instance. The one i mentioned is pretty limited, for instance if you have a ring of people that vote on validity of blocks, it basically is a trusting that ring + some extra measures that give better chance of detecting malfeasance.
@_date: 2015-07-01 16:41:12
Well a miner that makes a block can select transactions, but it is not really incentive aligned other than miners tending to pick those transactions paying more first.
Of course, this could in principle backfire; the miners might be able to earn more by from fewer transactions asking more and not filling it up. However, many people will just wait for the next miner, and the incentive to do such things is low as long as the block reward dominates.
@_date: 2015-07-01 12:02:38
Increasing block size, eventually, running a node would be too expensive aswel. Then we'd potentially *also* be back at forms of centralization. This is worth something, i.e. to some extent we should allow the transaction cost to increase if otherwise regular people can no longer really run a node.
How Bitcoin is implemented with inputs and outputs is quite inefficient compared to state-based solutions. But it takes a lot of balls and trust in new code to migrate it to something better. Other ways to make it more scalable is to simply recognize that lower-value transactions do not need as much security. i.e. the security of something like (plug) [hanging blocks]( might be sufficient.

What bankers want is not bitcoin, they just want the distibuted consensus. They're better off with Ethereum for that.
And for getting startup capital, it is investors, all sorts of angel investors etcetera.

*Anyone* can do that, not just banks. And you cannot just print bitcoins as banks can effectively now do, just needing some fraction in real currency.

So if you work hard to build stuff ontop of bitcoin, or put it on the insecure edge. Or you can 'just implement it' in Ethereum, or platforms based on Ethereum. And guess what, if PoS can be made to work,(and looks like it can) that works.
Hell, someone could actually use some of the issuance to pay for public goods. As someone said, "if 1% of block reward went to development, bitcoin price would increase more than 1% by now" Instead...


Let it be totally co-opted by those investors. As is necessary to get  the money. Perhaps Satoshi had a good idea, but his foresight was not as complete. Nor should it have been, we need to get our heads out of our asses and realize that these things we are trying to create are public goods, and there is no business model that does not have nasty side-effects.

You're a fucking idiot. *Why* does supply go up, it is *because* people are incentivized by the higher price.
If the price goes down, there is induced demand. But the extra suppliers don't turn up because the price goes down, but because the induced demand would have increased the price.
We're just looking at technological advances here, nothing to do with the fucking bitcoin mining, which has a negative effect all round except for securing bitcoin. (And there are probably better options there.)

Maybe in bizarro world. Resources used  are resources used. This electricity is not going elsewhere, ditto if it were photovoltaics.
At least in photovoltaics, maybe people are incentivized to use them, and maybe the powersupply can sometimes be cut out. Outcome is still result negative, because other opertunities to do that more directly would be missed. (Let me jump the gun: it is *you* not understanding basic economics and that it *is* a "zero sum game")
And it is likely *wasted* resources, there are other options to secure it, like PoS.(though also difficulty) Besides, last i checked bitcoin had multiple issues, like webwallets still being in use,(that'd be an argument against PoS i guess) to manifacture of mining equipment centralization.

This approach sounds much less likely to cause violence than buying drugs off the street. Because if you're doing that they have to basically advertise they're selling it, opening the possibility of turf wars.
I expect via silk road it usually arrives as an anonymous package.(Really i dont know, but i dont think it'd be anything overt.) If there was violence involved it would basically have to be when it was being produced.

If you have a trusted wallet service T, A wants to pay B, then A makes a bitcoin transaction to T(or makes sure there is enough credit, anyway), T then sends bitcoin to B. In the bitcoin system, T is a connection between A and B, but if millions of people use the system, that can be meaningless to an external investigator and T can delete logs that indicate why money was sent.
Caveits: you need large ammounts of users and ammounts and timing give hints. It is best if T varies the timing and ammount to minimize the information to be had there. T has to be trusted,(even more because of that) basically T has to have clear policy regarding algorithms.
I dont know if there are strategies regarding splitting up Ts wallets, i guess there are only strategies trying to hide that they belong to T,(otherwise in analysis, they could just look at a bunch of wallet as being equivalent to being the same wallet) but that decreases the ability of others to inspect Ts behavior.(and as such establish trustworthiness) Also it is bitcoin in-short-wait-bitcoin out, so it shouldnt contain much ever in the first place, so splitting to keep things in reserve doesnt particularly make sense.(Though some reserve might be needed if randomness can increase the payout. You want a good source of randomness of course!)
However trying to split 'not really T' wallets might still be an idea, if you take another model of trust. I mean not sure if people trust things in the 'make the logical connection' way, but rather do it by word of mouth/more visceral ways. For instance if there are good independent reporting systems where people can claim things went good/bad that might work.(I'd go for the 'make the logical connection' way though)
Splitting transactions probably also helps remove connections with old and new.
Oh, and by posting this publicly i have *basically* disbarred myself from actually doing it, presumably. I mean i think trust can be created just by people giving it a shot and a lot of code examples to produce the histograms to check that some method works.(If you want to do it, talk anonymously)

I dont see how what you're saying relates to drugs anymore. It could be *any* product. Illegality makes the drugs trade voilent, not scarcity. Obviously unless if supply cannot be increased and it is something critical, like food, or if it is extremely valueable by weight like diamonds. Drugs is none of those things, production can *easily* be ramped up.
My point is that making the end point delivery more stealthy makes voilence at that point less likely.
Perhaps drugs users should feel responsible for the rest of the chain, but they dont have control over that. Besides oil, coltan, diamonds all clearly have had voilence in production, and nearly all products have some concerns of environmentalism or labor.
Many drugs are plain bad, and all can be abused. But pushing things into illegality is a bad idea. It would be better to license sellers, it would allow control over potency, preventing toxic contaminants in production, some control over dosage, more possibility of contact with help.

It can do computation with javascript,(are there browsers that allow other languages?) even using the graphics card, accessing outside data, but can still be stopped from doing so, and if you make it well it will just step back neatly.(I otherwise it'd be unacceptable) It is hella portable, plenty of tools exist for it. It is well-designed.
Its continued development is assured. It can be used to make [native applications]( havent tried that yet) Or via a local server, otherwise.
It is the vision of lisp implemented by people who dont have the vision of lisp.(Otherwise it would have been way better yet, avoiding end-tags, same-language-for-scripts, lisp-style macros, replacement-based-macros)

'In the know'? Great wording, if you want to be seen as a believer rather someone who was convinced by facts. I hope you mean ill-informed. And the thread doesnt even seem that bad in that regard. Just some idiot comments like 'it doesnt offer what paypal offers'(if you can buy shit with it, obviously it does) Afaik the price volatility is a fact, but really whatever, is the value uncertain long term? Or, if you just want to convert back and forth to bitcoin quick, does the value change must in that quick exchange and how many people can do that without destabilizing the whole thing?
I suppose this is not very well researched opinion, but: Pretty likely the value will infact over-all keep rising considering it has a growing following, and there is the possibility bitcoins are being lost, decreasing the supply.(and the rate of mining is pre-fixed, well known) A bigger concern could be what happens if a second bitcoin came up.(What would happen to the first one)
The 'need 50% of computing power' thing seems a pretty big issue too. Wonder if 'future-bitcoin' could work by signing the first element of block chains in a (gpg)trust network, and use that instead of chain length, that would tie it all down?
