Its okay, they'll offer everything on 'loan'. Want a couch? Here's a loan. Want a place to stay? Here 'sanother loan. 
They then adjust the interest so that 95% of people can live out their productive lives while paying 90% of their income to living expenses/interest. 
Now you have made 'slavery' all legal!

Sorry phone typo. I meant BTC chine vouchers!
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:54:16
I have used this exchange without problems. They're support has been *very* professional.
@_date: 2014-02-23 10:17:13
How long ago did you make the deposit? And where do I find the link that displays which account I deposit to?
I can't find it on the BTC China website more.
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:54:42
But the protocol is not controllable. If they create a Chinacoin, people can still trade it for bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:31:40
Great writeup!
Hey , as a fellow expat in China interested in Bitcoin, can you give me a quick guide on how to purchase a TV China vouchers?  
I don't read Chinese and every link to a vouchers on BBC China Is in Chinese! Which site to you use, and how does  it work? 
Help would be great! Thanks

I know, I put some money into BTC CHina, and it went in *Instantly*. I mean, within 1 minute. Was shocked.
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:58:43
You should do a direct bank deposit with fy-bsg.com
Just got to any UOB cash deposit machine and follow instruction ont their website. I did that twice, and no problems
Lets keep the Singapore exchange going!

I didn't trust it at first. So I played around and deposited $10 AUD from my ANZ account, bought like 0.1 bit coins and withdrew the coin no problems (bitcoin transfers are instant, took about 5 hours to register bank transfer, will take 2-3 days I guess if you use another bank)
If you don't trust it, you should do the same.
I've bought about 4 bitcoins from the place now.

One of the very few. Most countries don't require you to pay taxes provided you're not residing in the country and your income is from foreign sources. You can't escape US taxes if you're a US citizen no matter where you live or work.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:01:09
Really? I signed up about 2 weeks ago no problems.
@_date: 2013-05-04 11:59:36
Really, my understanding is that btcchina is an exchange. You can put money in through Alipay and Liberty Reserve... 
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:55:49
Awesome Idea, I'll happily play!
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:27:33
Yup, just set up an account with China Construction Bank.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:03:38
Make your own order, sell at $180 AUD, someone will probably gobble it up. There was a sell that went through at 190 AUD b4.

What would be stopping a Chinese user is funding their Mt. Gox account in the firm place. China has very heavy rules in regards to how much money can leave the country. 
Sure, a few Chinese will have outside contacts, but they'll charge a hefty fee for doing this. Arbitrage will not be easy.
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:57:10
I'm not sure if its fair to put China under the contentious category. Yes, they have banned qqcoins before, but that bears little relation on bitcoins. They may, for example, not wanted a private company to control a major currency.
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:06:39
That's coz their not enough people trading. You cab sell your bitcoins there if the price is so high.
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:01:15
Try weexchange.com
Completely legitimate, just not many users. Bank transfers to ANZ, no trade commission.
@_date: 2013-05-08 07:00:28
Maybe economically, bit I think that's probably the day US launches WW3.
@_date: 2013-05-04 12:01:32
Given its covered on CCTV, it looks like Bitcoins has China's tacit support. China's always been proposing to the UN that the US dollar should be dethroned from its perch. Maybe they see bitcoins as an opportunity.
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:08:02
- Brief Introduction on Bitcoins
- Mention of the Nowegian guy who bought house from growth of bitcoins
- Mentions that bitcoins paves the way for future online currency
- Mentions that it is easy to convert to $US with bitcoins.
- Describes its difference from qqcoins, such that bitcoins is a fixed limit, and not controlled by a company. So it can't be manipulated by copying.
- Speculate that it is bound to continue to rise.
- Mentions that Chinese investment websites are now including bitcoins as an official discussion.
- Mentions, bitcoin's use is going to become broader and broader, and that bitcoins is being supported increasingly more in overseas companies.
- Speculate that in the future, people no not need traditional money anymore and can just use bitcoins.
In the summary, the report is *very* positive, on CCTV's serious financial program.
Bitcoin will Jump...

It's hard to get dual citizen. But singapore doesn't care about your citizenship for purposes of tax. As long as your funds are stored in Singapore.  There's no capital gains tax. US, however, will tax you wherever you live. 
To avoid capital gains tax, you basically need to give up you US citizenship.

If Rich people could do that and cause a permanent crash, it would have happened long ago. The market is even easier to manipulate in March or last year...
It recovered. Buy and hold is still pretty much the best strategy.

If CCTV did a 30 minute documentary on it... it means the Government is fine with it in the near future.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:28:50
Well, my plan mostly is to just by BTC with Yuan, and not bother converting it back. Eventually I'll probably either use BTC directly, and convert it to the currency of whichever country I move to next.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:55:37
Ahh.. what. Chinese are like cats, they will *always* get around (or ignore) the rules.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:54:17
Small company, but still quite a few bitcoins for sale at reasonable prices. Unlike MtGox, there's no commission, and its a local bank transfer to ANZ bank.
@_date: 2013-05-04 14:36:10
Since CCTV just did a 30 minute documentary on this (and trust me, you won't be able to dedicate a 30 minute documentary on BTC without prior governement approval), I'm guess China is currently supporting bitcoins.
China has always complained that the US dollar should not be the world currency. They've pushed for adoption of the Yuan, but they're also realistic. Perhaps they believe bitcoins well ensure that the US dominance will end, and are happy to promote it.
The amount leaking in/out of China via bitcoin is going to be small for a long time... and they're probably willing to break a few eggs to make the omelet.
@_date: 2013-05-06 22:00:21
US has far more press freedom, but for pure financial freedom... its a mixed bag. China has far less regulation, except when it comes to converting many overseas...
Which is why this is all so ironic.
@_date: 2013-05-06 20:54:17
News Flash: US economy is not free. That's why we use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-04 12:02:35
Given that CCTV is a government news outlet. It looks more like China wants more people to get into bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:02:12
Not really, US is just about the only country that does it...
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:42:26
Xinhua is one of the official state newspapers... its about as big as it gets in China. This, in combination with CCTV documentary, suggests that bitcoin has the full support of the Chinese government.
The Chinese government is run by scientists and engineers, who I guess, are as sick of banksters as the rest of us.
@_date: 2013-05-08 05:36:39
They can use that against bitcoin
'Bitcoin is supported by the evil commies'
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:17:44
Well I was talking about that. Not sure what you were talking about.
@_date: 2013-05-04 13:31:09
Well I can't read enough Chinese to know how it works, did create an account though :). BTC seems to be worth more in China than US.
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:40:15
I was looking into it. Apparently they support Alipay, which is like Paypal for china. If Alipay is anywhere near as popular as Paypal (Chinese confirm?), this would mean its relatively easy.
@_date: 2013-05-09 05:07:51
Thanks, will try that!
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:05:50
Looks like this is one of rare occasions where China is more free than USA....
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:26:27
The Chinese Government is run by scientists and engineers, who generally, like any other scientist and engineer, have a distaste towards bankers. In China, government owns the Banks.
In US, the Banks own the government. 
This could we be why China sees bitcoin in such a positive light.
My only fear is China's tacit support of bitcoin cast it in a worse light in western democracies. This could well US an excuse to make bitcoin illegal.
Wouldn't that be ironic? A country reputed for its lack of freedom will greater the greator financial liberty than the 'leader of the free world'?
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:43:17
Do you know if it is possible for foreigners to set-up exchange accounts at btcchina.com, and if so, the fees to depositing and withdrawing funds?
How would it compare to Mtgox?
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:06:10
Obvious it depends on how smart the state is. SIngapore is run by a PM who is a wrangler at Oxford (Top Maths Undergrad), US is run by... lawyers?
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:53:34
Err what.... ? Please live in China more...
The whole country is a mess of regulations and people finding ways around them.
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:07:28
Or they will Ban it cause they don't like China, and claim it is the currency of communists.

It's good for Western Union if they are flexible. A lot of places (See China) have policies against exchange. However, if they can facilitate a safe local-bitcoins type service, and handle all the technicals without consumers need to know how to manage bitcoins, they'd cut their own costs, and be a hell of a lot more convenient.
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:00:42
Singapore is smart, as a City state, Singapore thrives on trade and investments. By having no capital gains tax, and no regulation on bitcoins, Singapore will be a bitcoin haven for exchanges.
Couple this and their position as the world's 4th largest financial center, means that they're well positioned to be a hub of global bitcoin exchange.   The government will no doubt but a share of the exchange (as they do with banks and everything else here), and profit.
@_date: 2013-05-04 11:53:41
China has its own bitcoin exchange... they won't need to go through mtgox. I think all it needs to local bank deposits.
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:59:52
Of course, and the party bosses don't like Foreign Banks. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 13:38:44
It seems to be about 10-15% premium over Mtgox at the moment. Can we find a way to sell Bitcoins in China and help deliver bitcoins to those who need it?
@_date: 2013-05-09 06:06:57
Thanks! Is there a set time each week that bitcoiner's meet, or can you find them just about anytime?
