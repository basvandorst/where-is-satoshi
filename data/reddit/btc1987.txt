Thank you for the healthy skepticism it is much needed i think, in a space like this, and yes i agree with you on many points you have stated.  
Yet i am of the opinion all the problems with bitcoin right now are solvable, with due time. Bitcoin isnt perfect, but it is far superior to everything else out there, and the only perception that needs to shift in the mainstream is the understanding that our governments do nothing for us to nurture our own abundance and wealth. They instead steal. So the paradigm shift in my view is deep and complex on many levels, most "normal" brainwashed people dont understand, but that doesnt discount its disruptive power. It only elevates is in times like THESE, where there is so much doubt and uncertainty about all of this that its hard to see where this is all going. In my opinion it is going in the direction of togetherness and overall higher states of mental and emotional evolution, and financial freedom is a big part of that.

Yep. I think the most compelling case can be made as far as BTC goes is the fiat house of cards that will eventually crash. Adoption will be faster imo once were totally fucked.

Youre wrong on bitcoin, you dont understand it well enough. Every year except 2018 its posted higher median price range. People are banking on that continuing and this is why were all here.   
This particular "asset" is mostly volatile due to its nascency. Just like you couldnt understand why email was important in the 90s, you dont understand bitcoin in the same way. Give it time.

In australia, if you gamble on anything, your winnings are tax free. You dont pay taxes on your earnings if you go to the casino and win a bunch of fiat on a slot machine of playin poker.
Im not sure if its the same in your country, but it doesnt make sense to me why this would be a taxable event outside of the original purchase of btc

People like you are the future.
@_date: 2019-08-03 12:58:20
Get this. My cousin is a futures trader, we both found out about bitcoin in oct-nov 2017. Ive been incredibly bullish on it since i knew about it, he cant see how it supplants fiat and who would buy it.
He regrets not buying at 5k, not realizing price can easily hit ATH by end of the year. Im gonna regret not buying more under 25k.
My buy-up to price is 25k, yet depending on how btc moves in the coming months/years, that strategy could change to just simply exchanging fiat for btc every chance it get.
Ive been preaching to everyone who will listen, but sometimes its a case of "they have the eyes to see but not the ears to hear". That was me in mid 2017 when i first heard about it, ive despised the monetary system my entire life, and someone telling me about getting rich on a stock wasnt the reason i got into this.   
Bitcoin is the evolution of money, freedom and liberty. And i choose to place my power(finance) in a sound future and this is why i joined the party. Not to support a crumbling system.
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:40:50

So in your opinion there is really nothing stopping bitcoin from mooning? Just curious, if you feel like elaborating on your opinion.   
Whats also interesting to me is that right around the time of the current run up, we had Mnuchin, Trump, Brad Sherman, all talking shit. Coincidence? Do they only get louder during bull movements?
@_date: 2019-10-28 11:39:27
haha love this!
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:37:05
Then he's lying. Simple. If youre gonna claim to be a monetary scholar yet cant understand why sound money is better, im definitley not coming to someone like that for advice. 
He was paid to lie. End of story.

This is all necessary to complete the transformation from fiat money(dollars) to sound money(bitcoin). Without a major catastrophe, people would not wake up, especially those in western countries like myself who have generally comfortable standards of living, and dont understand the impact their indifference in decision making has on themseleves and the rest of the planet.I think its time these problems really smack us square in the mouth. Without it we wont be awoken from the hypnotic slavery were unknowingly accustomed to.Also, if you wanna see the world become a better place, the current paradigm needs to crumble, and we in the west stand to lose the greatest from this, so insure yourself by buying bitcoin, and in the very worst case, prepare yourself for a scenario where you may have to leave your own country to evade the inevitable drama.
Only when America falls off its high horse will we see true global change. This is akin to every major corrupt governance in history, and the same always holds true. When pigs become hogs, they get slaughtered. America is a ripe hog, readying itself for slaughter. Sucks to live in the land of the free, home of the brave. Or should i say, land of the corrupt, home of the slave?
The best thing about bitcoin is, this is our chance, to reclaim our freedom and sovereignty from tyrannical goverments. Look beyond the fear, drama, and uncertainty being expressed currently, cos on the other side i can see rainbows of evolution.
Just keep buying and erasing fiat from the system through bitcoin.  
EDIT: One other thing i forgot to mention in my own exploration of all this is this, people need to be prepared for something along the lines of a great depression. This system is designed to fail, in my opinion because it was meant to usher in an even greater level of control and slavery than what were experiencing at the moment, until all our rights and freedoms are erased. Yet without the USD being world reserve currency and such a strong alternative now available to everyone through bitcoin i find feel the plans these evil cunts have are going to be hindered tremendously. How that all actually plays out i have no idea.

Dont understand it, or have an agenda to keep the status quo. 50% of the shit i watch on youtube is either/or. Those that truly get it are sometimes afraid to say it too bluntly for fear of upsetting the sensitive bankers. Novogratz is like this, he tends to hold back.

In my opinion, jumping into mining at this stage of the game(obviously depends on the country) is a waste of hard earned slave cash. The reason i say this is because of the current trend of the market, if in fact we are in a bull market, its a really bad time to mine.  
I crunched the numbers, it would cost me at what i can currently afford to spend, 10k to set up a small decent mining rig that would earn me between $35-50 per day. 
So lets say best case scenario is $45 after bills:
You're looking at 1350 per month. The amount of time it would take me to earn the amount of money i had originally invested would be 7 months. Lets say in 7 months BTC price is 15k. That would mean ive lost 5k of value by jumping into mining at this very moment in time.   
Not to mention the risk of your mining hardware becoming obsolete in that span of time as new tech that is even faster comes out, meaning youre getting squeezed even harder.   
Best thing to do as another poster pointed out. WORK YOUR ASS OFF FOR THE NEXT 12-18 MONTHS, and pour every single cent you have into btc(did i mention i was a maximalist?)
@_date: 2019-10-28 05:36:04
Right. I get the rational perspective your attempting to share, but its really not doin it for me. 
How about we redefine it from "savings account" to "high risk-high reward savings account"? At the end of the day whatever you call it, its a genius idea and it has worked for me to the tune of 100s of % increase. 
There are days when BTC drops to 7500 and im looking at my "savings account"  from when it was at 13k and ive lost 60-70k. Who gives a fuck, i didnt sign up for this shit to be a bitch about it. Im grabbin bitcoin by the fuckin balls and if it goes to zero, fuck it, i made a decision that i was comfortable with, and ill live with it. Life goes on, no jumping off bridges for this kid.

If you cant put a set of coherent sentences together, just say you dont know. :) So far that is 2 incoherent posts in a row. Your intelligence isnt as great as your ego inflates it to be. And ive just waisted more time on you than i should, shame on me.
Yes i do believe nothing besides a few factors can really drag bitcoin under, but this is all speculation. Disrespecting somebody because theyre speculating on the future price of bitcoin, thats what losers do.
  
Im not interested in being right and patting myself on the back, Id just like to have a coherent conversation that doesnt result in insults or name calling.

You make it sound like an error in their "thinking" or "judgment" is whats caused this. These people are smart, highly calclulated and super manipulative. They know exactly what theyre doing, they know how to create sound monetary policy, yet dont, for a very specific reason. You give them an out by letting them rely on another lie, like "hey maybe this keynesian system doesnt actually work?"...once it all comes crashing down.
Ultimatley what i wanna hear is, weve been lying to you and playing you for hundreds of years so that you dont ever wake up to the reality that you are a slave.

You do have a point, but its all very calculated, and so far it has worked for me ridiculously well, i could cash out today, pay 50% CGT and still be better off than my traditional savings account.   
Stock market is also gambling, in my opinion, only the odds are skewed even further against you winning.
@_date: 2019-08-09 06:39:30

If this happened on a traditional bank account you wouldnt say shit. But yeah, make a transaction error in bitcoin and "its a bank, they dont have to do shit". Bullshit. Give the person their money, anything else is dishonest and fraudulent.

Source for your knowledge besides your fear and doubt? 
Also you say said government is corrupt? Would it have anything to do with monetary and fiscal policy by any chance!? 
The sad part about alot of these conversations is the FACT that a lot of this CORRUPTION stems from monetary and fiscal IRRESPONSIBILITY. 
  
Please try to understand bitcoin better.
@_date: 2019-10-30 05:28:48
Not necessarily, if for example Malta went all in, fair enough but their population would limit the amount that they are able to mine. If America went all in, different story. They are much better set up to take a larger haul than i tiny country, and this is where most of the liquidity lies also.

This is an interesting concept ive never heard mentioned in regards to BTC. Can you elaborate? "Bitcoin backed currency", wouldnt that concept in a way dilute the finite supply by essentially printing paper? Would the paper be limited to 21 million, or even broken down to the satoshi?

Depends on what "god" you believe, and how those beliefs define the nature of your existence. Especially if theyre wrapped in dogma and not experience. I wouldnt agree with your last sentence if you came from one of the worlds major religions, because theyre all designed to think and express in a certain way that make the opinions of those inside those beliefs, useless individuals who do not know how to fight when needed, or stand up for themselves.
@_date: 2019-10-29 06:09:27
Thats exactly why you gotta be aware of when you bought in. Im not calling it a savings account in 2018, or after any massive run up. Buying a shitload at 3k-5k in the last 12 months? Theres really no certainty in any of this, but youre playing probabilities, any trader will tell you there are no certainties in anything but if youre ballsy enough to play probablities, and you can eliminate as much uncertainty through sound decision making(aka studying, analyzing etc) then in my opinon you got nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2019-10-23 00:22:30
Sheesh, i fucking spelled BTC as BTS...
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:45:55
Its by design in my opinion. They cant just straight come out and say, "hey, there really is no arguement against bitcoin aside from its nascency, all other arguments have been successfully debunked" which would eliminate the need for "perceived debate". 
It also keeps people on the surface with their own understanding of crypto and not learning about it, when a "scholar of high intelligence" debunks the magic internet money that nobody understands. All arguements against bitcoin tend to be about FUD, which arent real parameters of measurement(in this context) when it comes to usability. 
In all the time ive spent researching bitcoin and crypto, i still dont know shit, and its been 3 years and close to 10000hrs. But i know a bullshit artist when i see one. I think the best thing about these debates in my view, is that everytime i watch one of these videos the person arguing for adoption has a stronger and stronger case, can you imagine trying to have this debate with a straight face when btc is @ 30k?
@_date: 2019-10-23 07:04:32

It is understandably a very difficult and complex situation, and thank you for sharing your knowledge. I admit, i am a very naive and idealistic individual who when confronted with a problem, only sees a solution, but sometimes, not the entire "grind" that is required to get to that point. Thanks for sharing. 
The best and only thing i can do right now is to pray for the people of the middle east, not to a God or any religion, but to the fundamental expression of the universe of life, to love, in which, as a species that we call "human", where we all fundamentally bleed red and share exactly the same human emotions as one another, beyond all religion, race and creed. I feel if we learned to respect one another from this platform, great change is possible.   
At the end of the day though, Lebanon is still being monetarily sanctioned, as you said, and i understand albeit from my own limited perspective how hard this all must be with everything that is going on, on other levels, but you know what? We all gotta rise up and find balls we never knew we had, cos similar crisis are going to affect the west and nobody is immune to the bullshit scenarios of pain and suffering that we have all co-created for ourselves.

Unfair and super shady on many many levels.

I think its all about liquidity and actual adoption. If 99% of the wealth is owned by 1% of the population, how does anybody ever expect a btc price over 30k? I dont think its possible, until countries start to jump in, and then it truly becomes a fomo-type race for adoption, as a country that is now considered 3rd world(Venezuela) is doing, who knows how its all gonna play out but ive always banked on this thing being taken seriously. 
Liquidity and adoption are neck and neck the winners long term, you cant have one without the other in my opinion. I think if countries starting hodling long term, theres no telling where this thing could go, but it def wouldnt be in the hands of wall street or a few whales.

What he said at the end really resonated with me. Emerging markets(like crypto) will be hit hard, but will recover the fastest. I anticipate this very thing happening, a massive panic-drop as people take their money out of an asset that they didnt realize was the hardest form of money in the world. The shift from risk-on to risk-off will be dramatic. 
This will be the true wake up call for people to understand bitcoin. A lot of people need this crisis because literally everyone who lives in mainstream everyday reality is brainwashed, until they cant sit in the comfort of their own homes watching mind-numbing specials while the planet around them is burning down.

Yeah i agree with that assessment to a certain extent with how he said it, but i find it hard to see how these emerging asian markets, without breaking away from the western keynesian ecoonomic system, dont see how these countries try to make it work with the current system imploding on itself.
The financial system is being completley restructured and id love to know how it all plays out. And i dont see how bitcoin doesnt have a HUGE future once that restructure is complete.

100%. Gonna be a tough next 2 years in my opinion, depending on the timing of the next global financial crisis. I think the more time bitcoin is given to mature before that event starts becoming obvious in the mainstream, the better off it will be.   
The psychological war games are the real problem, because the west is very malleable, and people generally have weak psyches that are easily influenced and manipulated.
