Lol, no. If they did, why is it that not a single security researcher in the history of the world has managed to catch them doing it? Despite armies of people decompiling Android APKs and iOS IPAs and intercepting these apps' network traffic, nobody has ever produced a single shred of evidence that they're sending audio recordings back to base.
Do you even have any idea how much data it would consume if your phone were recording you all fucking day and sending it to some distant server? A day's worth of audio recorded at even 64kbit per second - a pretty shitty quality that would be almost impossible to automatically transcribe - is still roughly 700 mb *per day*. How on earth do you think it would be possible to hide that sort of data usage from the consumer? 
Nothing about an app you run on your local device is hidden from view, every single aspect of it can be dissected and observed, and yet nobody has ever observed the behaviour you're talking about. 
Instead we have a bunch of idiots who confuse the Baader-Meinhof effect for some massive Orwellian spying conspiracy, who don't realise they're so mind-numbingly irrelevant that there's precisely zero chance that the NSA has any interest in listening to them eat cheetos and watch anime.

It's a good start, but doesn't it concern you that you have to jump through so many hoops to make the numbers realistic? Constructing an imaginary scenario in which the numbers work isn't the difficulty, it's constructing an imaginary scenario that has any realistic, real-world value which still results in numbers that work. 
For instance, when you're talking about only recording *after* certain words are spoken: how do you identify when those words are spoken without recording it in the first place?
When you say people speak for a total of two hours over the course of a day, do you see why that complicates your proposed one hour recording? How do you identify when to do your one hour of recording when the information you're after is spread so thinly? 
Oh also, don't forget you also have to invent some kind of new magical technology that makes it impossible for any 16 year old with a packet sniffer to detect that you're doing all of this stuff.
You also have to ensure that not one of the tens of thousands of employees in your company ever decides to grow a moral backbone and tell the press what you're doing, since not only are you breaking the law, you're also running the risk of destroying your brand reputation.
There are so many holes in your conspiracy theory, I don't think you're going to be able to patch them all, and even if you managed it you still have reality to contend with - nobody has *ever* identified this behaviour actually happening in the wild.
I'm glad that you're starting to consider things, just don't jump the first hurdle and think you've completed the race.

You don't need other people to investigate, simple mathematics should tell you what you're proposing is impossible. 
For instance, recording video isn't free, it requires energy to run the camera, energy to run the SoC which receives the camera information, energy to write that information to disk or to RAM, energy to connect to the cell network or wifi network to transmit, and so on - if your phone was doing all of this stuff 24/7 your battery would last maybe three or four hours at *best*, and that's assuming you didn't use your phone to do anything else while it was recording.
Or how about the storage and processing requirements to make use of all that data? As of April 2014 there were a total 327,577,529 mobile phones in active use in America - that's more than the population of the whole country, by the way.
If we were ultra-conservative and said that each phone only recorded one single hour of ridiculously low quality video (say 320p) each day and sent it to the NSA, that's still 144 MB * 327,577,529 phones = 47,171,164,176 MB - that's ***forty-seven thousand terabytes of data every single day*** that the NSA would have to store! I mean, that is just a fucking *staggering* number, right? 
Just use your brain, *think* before you make these crazy claims and it will be immediately obvious to you why they're simply not true. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:17:14


The fact you don't see the irony in what you just wrote is mind-boggling. My entire point is that *you have no knowledge* yet you continue to make ridiculous claims that even the most simple mathematics can disprove.
You made this dumb assertion that your phone is spying on you. Did you bother to wonder whether it was possible in the first place? Did you bother to do any reading on the subject, maybe see if there's any evidence for your claim? Did you even bother to just add some simple numbers together to figure out if it was feasible? Of course not, you just invented a conspiracy out of whole cloth and asserted it as fact.
You are the archetype for why discussions on this subject are so fruitless: they're crammed full of people who, despite having zero subject matter knowledge, make wild, idiotic pronouncements that make no sense, and those pronouncements get swallowed whole by other idiots who also lack enough common sense to see through them, until it's a commonly accepted (but totally inaccurate) factoid that everyone's phone is spying on them. 
*Think* for a change.

And as we all know, past performance is a perfect indicator of future performance, that’s why I’m holding on to this mountain of tulip bulbs. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:37:25
Hmm, it sounds like you're unfamiliar with [the tulip mania of the Dutch Golden Age](
Tulip mania is the ultimate example of a speculative bubble, when a product or stock is priced well above its intrinsic value for no discernible reason, which many people believe is true of Bitcoin.
I reckon that if Bitcoin does eventually crash it'll be forever regarded as this century's tulip mania and in fact it'll probably replace tulip mania in the general discourse as the go-to reference when talking about speculative bubbles, like how Madoff has become the go-to reference for Ponzi schemes.

If you want to see what a country looks like when it can't inflate its way out of debt, take a look at Greece.

Their tweets suggest they didn't take anything over, they just refused to sell the domain to Kim. They say Kim offered them 1% of the new company for it.

China's external debt is $635 billion, champ.

Among many reasons, debt is an efficient way to finance projects that you otherwise couldn't afford but which will provide an overall benefit to your society, in the same way that it's easier for you to borrow money to buy a house today instead of paying for one in cash thirty years from now.
If you're not trolling, and you truly don't understand the purpose of debt, there are plenty of sites that can give you a rundown of basic economic principles. 
@_date: 2012-09-02 11:58:52
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Good job.

What kind of magical fairyland do you live in where economies work without debt?
@_date: 2012-09-02 12:26:46
What do those words even mean, "artificially promoted by an inflationary currency"? Inflation reduces your debt burden, it doesn't increase it.

Nope, the bands / musicians / podcasters can pay a one-off $10 USD (or bitcoin equivalent, heh) to upgrade their account and get a few extra features, like a higher file size limit and so on.
To be frank, the bonus features uploaders get for upgrading are pretty limited since Tindeck is pretty generous to begin with, but people tend to upgrade just as a way to say thanks and to help us pay the (considerable) server bill each month.


Above all I want to make sure Tindeck is always free and fully-featured for everybody - the community is way more important to me than just making money.
If I could replace the ad revenue in some other way without degrading the user experience then I absolutely would, but I don't want to do that by making existing features pay-only.

Heh, there's so much of it I had to create a new genre tag for it. But it's cool, I like the fact that the Homestuck community finds Tindeck so useful. All I ever wanted Tindeck to be was useful.
