I'd be surprised if he showed up.

Doubtful (live at least). CSPAN3 might.  CSPAN2 is Senate floor action, CSPAN1 is House floor action, when they're in session. 
Hearings on CSPAN broadcast are pretty rare.

Platitudes that mean absolutely nothing.

Believe it or not, people have had things (including bitcoins) stolen from them in public places.  
It's absurd to ridicule someone who thinks (very reasonably) that they need a means for self defense during those exchanges.

Ah. I was speaking in a theoretical sense.  Though with my general knowledge gleaned from a few summers of emptying cash boxes on snack machines (not related to the particular machine at hand) that does make sense.

No one in the Senate now will ever participate in the Bitcoin economy.  Their kids, maybe.  Their staff, maybe.  
But not them. 
What you really need to figure out (not easy to do) is which STAFF know what's going on - there are definitely a few.

Yeah - you're right.  No one's ever been mugged for $40.

You're right - there's no danger whatsoever in exchanging large quantities of cash for a physically ethereal product with someone you've never met.  
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:02:42
That's my understanding - though I'm not exactly convenient enough to find out.

If transactions stayed somewhat even, there'd be minimal emptying/filling needed. 
It might even make sense to offer slightly better rates/lower fees one way or another if things were getting out of whack one way or another.
