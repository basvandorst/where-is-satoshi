Nice to see you do this. I tip a few bits to lesser known content creators when I can just to motivate them to keep trucking

I got one too lol

You have got to be kidding me, he's selling 1 BTC for around $1200 each. Anyone that buys that is getting scammed
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:28:33
Thank you sir!

If you don't mind, what keyword did you search for to get the ad?
@_date: 2014-06-21 03:10:18
Yes, economic incentive will me provided with bitcoin

Even if they did try to track them down, what are the chances of them finding the perpetrators and then actually getting them to give back the stolen bitcoins? It's just not happening, this might be the only option left. May as well force Google to tidy up its adwords program and get rid of the junk ads.

This guy is great and is worth watching.

Music is a huge part of the Twitch experience, I do agree that this opens doors for competitors. Now streamers are getting infringement flags left and right and viewers aren't happy because they can't listen to music. Unlike YouTube, music can make or break the experience one has when using Twitch.

If you want to have a group discussion, please set up a time so I can prepare for it.

I don't have a twitter or fb either, but I appreciate your work by spreading Bitcoin. Some people take offense to this but I see no problem with what your doing. Can't like/tweet you, but gave you an up vote here. 1AykUYssbWZRrFPoRv2u7i84nmfUZykCuk My address.

very cool and nice of u to do. Spreading BTC to the youth, I love it!
@_date: 2014-08-13 05:35:48
As great as this sounds, it's not a new development. It's been going on for a year now. Anyways, it would legitimize Bitcoin if it went through.

As an avid fan of Twitch myself, I must say that streamers/viewers aren't happy about this. Before everyone gets all up in arms about me saying this, go look at any top streams going on right now. A common anger is in the air, not having the ability to stream with whatever music you want to. Now Twitch operates like YouTube, disallowing its partners the access to stream with the music of their choosing. 
If you want more info on this, a Verge article sums it up quite nicely: 
As a fan of bitcoin and a fan of twitch, I obviously have mix feelings about this.

This is huge man... absolutely huge. Other large companies are likely to follow
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:39:55
Really funny tbh, I for one had a laugh 
@_date: 2014-08-18 22:22:38
Do whatever is necessary to protect your personal info, it's not something I'm after. This isn't a conspiracy to take advantage of overs. If you genuinely need comforting, I'll give it to you. I've already talked to one individual and I think I made his day better, and I want to do the same for others.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:36:33
Holding for the most part. If the time ever comes when a local business around me accepts bitcoin, I'll be sure to buy something with it. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 22:38:52
Thank you for posting this, many people will appreciate it. Can we get this top comment so everyone has a chance to read the article?
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:30:37
Sorry but there's no way to confirm that these are your children. Also, explicitly asking for donations is frowned up here. 16 Bitcoin for two newborns is decent, so I don't see the point in begging.
@_date: 2014-08-07 04:58:52
I doubt many streamers will bother with that, as music is more of an on the go type of thing, not like YouTube where you plan things ahead. And yes, I think the next streaming service as well as all businesses out there will be more open to Bitcoin going forward. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:40:57
Obvious relation to bitcoin. But let's be honest, it would be funny if they approved virtual currencies in MMOs like WoW. I'm VERY curious to see how their approval process works
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:32:55
Think about the implications though, Paypal could create an extra flow of billions from fees by doing this
