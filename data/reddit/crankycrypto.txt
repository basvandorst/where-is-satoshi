I agree. I have invested in cryptos, traded, and have scripting experience but just now trying to learn the development aspects in crypto. I don't feel I will be working for any major company as a developer but I feel to be apart of the movement there needs to be a basic understanding of what is behind the GUI.

I respect your opinion but but do you really feel it is that bad? I believe blockchain is about decentralization and freedom of the people to act in their best interest. By this theory it is important we adapt to the needs of the few and the many. A fork is freedom even when we hate the form of the freedom.

I watched the documentary "Smartest guys in the room" and there was a different story. I thought the deregulation of Califorina power was what allowed Enron take advantage. Also their failed venture in India and how they hid the lost money by purchasing ships and hiding in different corporations. I am not trying to get in an argument I really like to know when I am incorrect. Also this is a minor example to my statement so it is not a real concern, but having my facts straight is always a process.

Well SAID!! I have run small businesses and I can tell you I could play with cashflow like one would never find. But when you get to big numbers it is impossible to find the hidden stuff given enough time to cook the books.
Did you know Maddoff was audited by the SEC 6+ times. 
Enron did amazing things with the books. And keep in mind for every Enron there are 1,000 that haven't got caught. 
Open ledger allows us to see the books in LIVE instance. This can't be faked or fixed if people are paying attention.

Tonny, 
The way adults converse is to share experience and knowledge. When there is a different opinion adults share references/fact. 
Many times the same reference/facts can be seen by two different people and they arrive with different opinions. When the opinions vary then each adult tries to explain how they derive their final solution/opinion based on the shared facts.
In some rare cases one person learns a new way to look at the same fact(s). This does not always change the opinion but allows person 1 to understand the opinion of person 2.
But this adult process cannot be be complete when insults and failure to share resources/facts are the only basis of communication. 
If you would like others to share your opinions you must atleast pretend to show respect and offer resources. Then you must be able to express the reasons of your opinion based on the shared fact(s). If you are unwilling to operate in a civil manner and you offer only insults and hate, I wish to discontinue pretending this is an adult process. I consider insults to be a waste of time. This does not mean I have no respect for your opinion but I do have no respect for your methods.

US Dollar was founded in 1792. At the time there were over 700 currencies in the USA. It took the federal government along time to get a federalized currency. 
I have no idea where this guy got '5 years' from and I believe US Fiat will be around just like the US post office still devilers mail (email claimed most of those letters but not all).
The ludites deserve to enjoy what ever currency they want. Freedom allows choices even when the choice is not in your best interest. 
But given USD has a 200+ year head start, one must admit crypto has taken alot of market share in a short time.

Interesting concept. I hope there are some developers working on this... “they’re all going to interrelate … and there will be exchange rates for all of them. My guess is that it will centralize around a wallet that you have, and when you pay for that Starbucks, your wallet will optimize to whichever currency has most value.” 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:46:20
Most people pretend this isn't a thing. Since crypto I have done tons of research on the history of currency. England was the world bank before USA. Near the end of Englands reign of the world bank they went off the gold standard. Luckily for the world WW2 came along and the economic boom allowed England to hand the world bank responsibility to USA. But in 1971 Nixon was scared since the national debt was almost $1 trillion and it was estimated there was 3 times as much USD in foreign countries than the US could back up with gold. So to prevent a run on the WORLD bank he did what he felt he had to do.
Well now it seems US prints money to pay off debt payments and create an artifical growth of the economy. The side effect is the further away a currency is from the world bank value , USD, the more the next country has to print to keep up. Zimbawe and Argentina had to print to keep up. The guys on the bottom have a huge disadvantage. 
I feel many of us US citizens look down on these countries and feel we could have done better in the same situation. 
Centralized currency is unhealthy and has very little future. I am not sure current blockchain is the answer but it is the step in the right direction.

I'm learning about blockchain development and I love lighting network over eth smart contracts. However, how does LN address Terminablity of contracts? Basically what is to prevent a contract that cannot be process to terminated? Endless loops and such would cause huge financial loss.

I don't think it should start with any other world. Gold, Cash, are both copies of the blockchain, with modifications. Alt coins are not the same blockchain or the same code and rules.
So why is it insulting to use the name?
I do agree the online promotions and social influence trying to claim BCH is 'the real bitcoin', was misleading and underhanded. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:33:35
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:23:38
I believe BCH increased some transaction size and claims it is a game changer. I was all for BCH fork, like the others, till the online promotion of BCH being the real bitcoin. It's like a child saying he was there before the parents. I believe this is insulting and I do not support concepts that show no respect for the ones who were first.

I do not have the same opinion of fraud in the case of the BCH fork. I personally HATE BCH and what it stands for so i do not own any. We all have a vote, energy and currency. But I do not VOTE to remove the opinions and liberties of others.

Those who refuse to educate themself and adapt are no longer valid. If these negative nancys would argue of scalability issues or other concerns that are real, it would bring some weight to their statements. As it is now, they are simply saying, "It is new, I don't like it and I can tell you with out learning anything else, it is worthless."
What all these luddites fail to learn is the utility of cryptocurrency. Weather BTC is $100k or $5 each, it will function as smart money. A system based on math. Math doesn't care if you are rich or poor, black or white. Math will rule over crony capitalism, a true capitalism will rise.

This expert was actually bringing a great point. Blockchain is more expensive to operate. Finally a real complaint about blockchain. He had me convinced that he did his homework till he said crypto is for criminals. LOL
US dollar is untracable (physical dollar). Bitcoin is very hard to hide the transactions and tumblers can be very costly. Much cheaper to use phsycial dollars to hide transactions.
But addressing the costly expense of blockchain to run, yes it is more costly and we, the people, like to see what is going on with our money. Wallstreet and Banks have lost the trust of the people time and time again. We no longer trust a hidden ledger and if there is an extra point added for the luxury of open ledger we are willing to pay for it.

I stand corrected. Market Share was not the right term. But I am not sure I consider all crypto to be a currency. I guess it has take a portion of investments (portfolio). So I can't think of the best term but when I said market share I meant investment portfolios.

UPDATE Edit: I'm reading something now about POS, my opinion below might change. LOL
I have been seeing this opinion more and I believe the PoW is required only because society requires cost of production to determine value. If we moved BTC to POS then it would not be valued by 99.9% of society. In order to reprogram the values of humanity requires POW to give perceived value for the purpose of adoption. 
But I feel POS can support value by Utility. But this takes time. I bet if you would have told people in 1990 that a BBS where people share family photos and a daily journal of our personal lives is worth $600 Billion they would laugh at you. 
Perception is the true struggle for blockchain. 
Side note: I believe bitcoin could possibly be the proper motivation to create extreme abundant green energy. If burning electricity creates more money then that money will be used more and more to create cheaper sources and cleaner sources of electricity.

According to many precious metal 'experts' building advance hard ware space worthing will need gold more than silver.
Plus the mining expense per ouce of gold is 10 to 1 of silver. 
But really it is based on perception of value. But man I really love my smart phone and computer, so I personally feel silver and silicone has more value per ounce.
