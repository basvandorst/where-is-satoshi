I think by the third time you'd trigger some kind of investigation by the feds.

Well considering you can literally generate a new wallet address in an instant I bet it wouldn't be too hard to tumble the coins around enough to obfuscate them to the point where people won't bother following the breadcrumbs.

Not really sure what you think is so funny.  Apple stock has been diluted several times and any shares you purchased beforehand would most definitely be affected.

It's not about whether or not you'd actually get in trouble, it's about whether or not you'd want to deal with the hassle of the IRS, FBI, and SEC all breathing hot fire down your neck looking for literally anything to bring you down with.  For the rest of your life.  
Honestly you'd probably be fine as long as you weren't crazy about it. Buying one stock and then just selling it at a good time probably wouldn't be too suspicious.

I've thought about this one a lot and I've always wondered what the MOST profitable thing you could do would be if you could go back in time.
The most obvious things seem to be stuff like investing in Apple, but with how many times the stock has been diluted there's no telling how much your shares would actually be worth.  There's also the looming threat of you being investigated for insider trading if you somehow manage to have the foresight to sell at the perfect time to maximize your profit.
That makes bitcoin seem like the best option.  You could buy tons of it without upsetting the market in the early days and then slowly sell it over time since you'd know exactly when the dips are coming.  Obviously you wouldn't want to dump your whole stash at once because that fucks the market but if you were strategic about when you sold I feel like you could milk billions out of it with almost no effort.  You could make hundreds of millions just selling right before the huge China crash when they were going for like 15K a piece.

And through their hard work and dedication you can now use bitcoin on like 10 different websites!
I hear there's even a bitcoin ATM in like 2 states!
Oh no, the community is splintered into hundreds of different altcoins and now no real businesses want anything to do with cryptocurrency because it's obviously a fad :( Shit.  
Guess you can still buy drugs with it.

That's what makes it such an interesting thought experiment.  You'd have to find a careful balance between maximizing profit and minimizing fallout because once you start trading millions of dollars around you start actually affect the world around you in real and noticeable ways.

Depends how the dividends pay out.  If we're talking straight gains Apple comes out way ahead. 
Blackrock started at about 8 bucks a share and they closed today at 483.  So if you bought $1000 worth of blackrock in 1998, it'd be worth about 60k.  If you took that same $1000 in 1998 and instead bought Apple for about 50 cents a pop, it could potentially be worth up to about 600K today depending how much it was diluted over time.
