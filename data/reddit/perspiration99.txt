Congrats to Purse!  I love to shop there.  Such great discounts.  :) 
@_date: 2016-04-07 20:58:52
Works great for larger items.  If it doesn't get picked up after a few days, try lowering your discount rate.  I bought a laptop last year for 17% off.  Great deal.  :)

sounds like time to shop now!  :)

Download and Install - ProTip - Chrome Plugin: [
in the Chrome store:
As an artist, get a Bitcoin wallet, copy/paste your address into your work and you're all set.  YouTube, Soundcloud, Twitter, Blogger, Wordpress, anything.... and then you're ProTip Ready.  Ask your fans to install ProTip and tip you for your work today! 
@_date: 2015-12-21 02:56:20
Yup!  Artists should add their Bitcoin address to their youtube, soundcloud, blog, twitter, anywhere...  but it only tips your top ten based upon time... so it really will automatically reward people you enjoy.  :) 
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:12:16
ProTip uses batching to send out your ten weekly tips at one time.  It also gathers your time throughout the week to determine your top ten and could then wait until you had enough value to send the transaction.

try refreshing?

It'd be great if there were a Dash, Doge, Litecoin version... especially if they could improve the core software and just have the coins be modules... but anyway, the code is there...

I think the blacklist is to prevent you from tipping yourself accidentally on sites where you use your own bitcoin address, like exchanges, google searches...   (sites that don't produce tippable content) 
The twitter section is to highlight donors and early supports of the project.

it also seemed like there may have been some issue with how he was trying to order the cards.  You're not exchanging the cards for the other ones, you're buying the gas cards with the gift cards.  
still seemed like an awesome longshot, but if there was any way to save money on gas, I'd imagine it would be with bitcoin.

This thing looks really neat!  Have you guys seen the video?  They blow it up in seconds -- without using a pump.  Aaaamzing:  [

Business Transfers: ChangeTip may be acquired by another business. With these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.

ChangeTip is really cool and enables the type of bitcoin micropayments that could really help the internet.

I've been saving 30% pretty regularly.  It only seems natural to me that they would charge a fee for their service.  
@_date: 2016-02-17 19:14:01
I guess the Early Bird gets the Discount as the old saying goes. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 20:13:14
You have to complete your first order at 15-20% and then it unlocks the ability to set a discount all the way to 50% (though it's harder to get those orders to fill).  
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:14:08
Perhaps give it another try?  I've been getting nothing but 30-35% lately.  and quickly too. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:46:34
They recently had a blog post that explained it.  [Gift cards are worth less than Bitcoin or Cash]( because you can only use them in one place.  People trade these gift cards for bitcoins and purse takes a fee.  
[It's really an interesting post.](  Amazon created an illiquid market for their gift cards by not allowing you to verify the balance by using the code on the back.  Could be a real opportunity for bitcoin.

There's a big article about it on Bitcoin.com. It has Anonymity, Micropayments and Encrypted Messaging.  Sounds cool: [

yah, but that's just a paperweight.  This can actually do stuff.

Pretty sure it's about what you can do with the Pi, not just the Pi.  ;)

I think it's more like:

 - Buy on Christmas Eve

looks like it's a special founder's edition.  Like the 21 box it might be more targeted at coders and people who want to learn how to use Open Transactions.

This is great!

[ProTip, the automatic bitcoin tipping browser plugin already exists...]( 
IBT: You've said Aurous is going to pay artists using a service called ProTip. Could you explain how that's going to work? 
Sampson: The way ProTip works is basically it tracks what you're listening to and what you're watching, and allows you to support content creators. I'm not affiliated with ProTip in any way. If you have a favorite YouTuber, and they have a bitcoin address, for every minute you watch their videos, that starts adding up tips. And after a certain time period, you can cash out your entire tip to that creator. If you watch an hour of their content, you can send them $15, or something like that. That's similar to what we're going to do. We're going to integrate the same source code they're using to track what users are listening to. We're not going to be tracking people, but we'll be able to track what people are listening to. They'll be able to choose if they want to support an artist, and after a certain threshold, the money goes out. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:27:49
ProTip is available.  It's a beta, there may be some bugs, but you can try it now:

Test his keys!  Prove him wrong!  
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:52:29
ProTip is open source, so this is definitely a preferred usage and one of the reasons open source software is awesome.  ProTip only uses Bitcoin, so once it is enabled you will be able to use bitcoin to reward artists.  win-win.  ;)

I almost described it as the "new napster", but I wanted people to get my reference... ;)

Looks like downloads were suspended on Oct 15.  Let's hope it's back up soon.

Too bad.  Looks like you could have saved  $45 with [Purse Instant]( 
@_date: 2015-10-26 19:43:12
and open source too.  just like Bitcoin.  So it can be included in any app that wants to reward artists.  Maybe even Popcorn Time?  ;) 
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:10:05
ProTip - automatic bitcoin tipping allows you to reward content creators using a chrome plugin that scans the page for bitcoin addresses, times how long you enjoy the site and pays the top sites based upon your allowance.   They are working on adding a paywall feature similar to what you describe:   
@_date: 2015-10-11 19:49:13
it sounds like that user activated 2FA after the fact.  I read on their blog that users with 2FA were not affected. 
@_date: 2015-10-26 19:42:25
nice!  Autotip is fully compatible with ProTip, thanks to the power of open source!  :)

you are correct sir!
