If coinbase enabled segwit, the usage would moon.

Someone out there doesn't like Tor.  Btc could be next.

For the first time I don't want to punch you (someone who says this) in the mouth multiple times.  Upboats for you.
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:10:11
My balances are right. Except my wire transfer is still in limbo...

Back in the day, once it hit 250k people threw in the towel.

Definitely the best choice and the ultimate fuck you.

Couldn't you just get a brand new number, import to Apple pay then shred the card?

They have been planning for 3 years... coinbase just stole their idea of an exchange.

Federal taxes do not go to that. Most goes to paying for someone else's healthcare, interest on debt, and killing people in the middle east.
27.49% to healthcare
23.91% to defense
18.17% to job/family security
9.01% to net interest
3.59% education
etc etc.

He also said he will repeal and replace Obamacare... headlines today said differently.

I have friends that work at corporate.  All have said Bitcoin is spoke of positively by management.

You have a false sense of security.  iPhone https inside apps has been know to have flaws for example.

Tons of people lost their coins during the last rally. Why are people forgetting this?
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:53:12
Did you ever get access to this?
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:57:12
Not sure if newsworthy. A VP at a bank/finance firm isn’t that high up.
Visa has 17k employees.  There’s literally thousands of VPs.

I have been into Bitcoin since it was worth 80 cents, mined on large scale. Yet still don't know how to claim that with my iPhone.
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:25:56
Good to know but how will the general public know?  The problem with Bitcoin isn't adoption, it's technical/app knowledge of general users.

Isn’t this a security risk posting this image?
