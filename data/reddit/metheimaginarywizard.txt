Any altcoin which gained marketshare would see its mining move to china and other cheap energy nations.
You can't ignore economies of scale.

Nobody would be missed, no devs are irreplaceable.
Devs can only propose ways, the ecosystem has to choose.
While hearn has good points (the blocksize limit has to rise, the network has to have multiple implementations, and there should be a place for uncensored discussions) I'm sad to see how immaturely he acted.

A bigger block limit is needed despite Hearn's tantrum.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:00:47
He has very good points, but the tantrum and fear mongering was unneeded. Such a shame, it was very unprofessional.

I'm not concerned by btc going to 0 even if it happens.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:50:01
No altcoins can resist mining concentrating in china as the power and labour are the cheapest there.
Good luck.

It's only partly because of hearn/core. I guess cryptsy has more weight in the dip.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:45:12
Not the first concerted attack and I guess won't be the last.

Tbh, I don't think many people would want to abandon the blockhain...time will tell. If it's good I'll use it. Otherwise crippling the network now is a big mistake (not rising the blocksize limit, creating a feemarket too soon)
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:02:03
I would argue that the exit is easy.
Participants of the network have to use an other implememtation.
Core is certainly stalling or at least have their priorities wrong.

Indeed, that's why I respect Gavin and garzik.
Hearn, maxwelk, todd and Back were always drama queens.
I just hope that they follow Hearn sooner or later.

Segwith is not a solution in itself.
Lighting is vapor at this stage, but it needs bigger blocks too.

No, it's censorship and manipulation.
A mod have the following responsibility:
- Taking out the trash (trolls, scammers, spammers)
- Do not influence discussions
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:35:16


And there are the ones who actually use and build it...

Spv is crucial as most people wouldn't want to bother with the full blockchain, they only want to use the currency.
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:51:31
Noone can argue that the limit can stay at 1MB for long. It's a fallacy.

Good luck shitcoin peddler.

If he could sell all of his btc then he didn't even have any use for it.
Good riddance.
