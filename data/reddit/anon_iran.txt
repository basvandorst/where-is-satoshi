It is like saying US banned bitcoin just because a dude called Dimon said "bitcoin is fraud". Random dude's statements are not the law even if the news sites publish articles as if it is the law!

The electricity cost in Iran is not a fixed rate. It ranges from as low as 0.4 US cent ($0.004) up (don't know the max, somewhere around $0.5 maybe). The way it works is that government (controlling the electric company) gives discounts to certain industries in order to help the economy continue growing. For instance the electricity cost in agricultural industry is less than 1 cents and when someone has a business that is getting this discount they are allowed to use the cheap electricity only for that purpose not something else such as mining bitcoin (this part is the same anywhere else in the world, it is like getting a license to do one thing but do something else with it). That all the drama that has been going on and the only reason why their miners were confiscated.  
In a way this is good news, because now there is a clear law about mining bitcoin whereas before it was all in grey area and every random dude in the government made any random statement about bitcoin they liked!

Since when TehranTimes gets their news about Iran from a shitty news website :D
By the way the exchanges that the article names 
BTXCapital: does not exist
Coinava: is bullshit, an a privacy hazard
Our only option is localbitcoins or other Persian forums to find peers in order to trade with.

I am sorry but this is a "twisted news". The main keyword is "in official reports". 
Dollar price in Iran has been too volatile, but Euro has been more stable with less fluctuations. So "Valiollah Seif" said "we need a currency with more stability to use as a base currency for reports and also use it more in foreign exchanges" not ditch USD.
"یکی از اقداماتی که باید انجام شود این است که گزارشگری مالی نباید با دلار انجام شود و این کار یک اشتباه است. باید ارزی را مبنا قرار دهیم که ثبات بیشتری داشته باشد و در تجارت خارجی کشور نیز بیشتر مورد استفاده قرار گیرد."
As far as bitcoin goes, we are accumulating ;)
