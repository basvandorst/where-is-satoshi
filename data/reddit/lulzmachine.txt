If something goes down 40% and then up 17% that means it in total lost 70%:
0.6*1.17 = 0.702

Has this affected transfer prices?

Make sure you write on his bio that he's a scammer please. Could help the next guy.

Lol trying to send 100$ would cost you 200$ in this mempool

Yes I know how it works. The main problem is that javascript isn't really opensource/auditable. They could easily swap out the script for something that sends your private key in cleartext to the server, without anyone noticing.
Same problem that mega has.
It means they will probably keep the security on to protect themselves from ever having the keys, but it doesn't protect the user since the script could be switched.

As an information security guy I have to commend you on this. It seems clever!

Well there are two sides to that. Claiming you have browser-side encryption to protect the users is straight up false.
Having a method that you know is not working in order to give the appearance of trustworthiness, you are indulging in "security theatre". Same thing that happened to airlines in the US and EU after 9/11 -- heightening the sense of security, without heightening actual security.
But yes, it's also true that in the end you have to trust all the layers below-and-including the layer that your security is implemented on.

Seems andreas thinks browser-side encryption protects the users. Guess he has some reading up to do. (it only protects the company)

If you're profitable, then how long have you kept it running? And did you use any trading frameworks or so to build it? Been putting together small similar things myself, but haven't really put the effort into making anything *good*

With low hashpower the fees will increase a lot. And a coin with high transfer fees won't look too attractive as the payment model for the future

There's a difference between *can* safely lose and *want* to safely lose

That's because they are traded in BTC. If litecoin to btc stays the same value and BTC loses 10% to the dollar, that means litecoin will also lose 10% to the dollar. Ez math

The only ones who use facebook and google are english-speaking people living there. Plus a few geeks. The rest use the home-grown social networks like weibo. They don't have to send people to prison to make something irrelevant. Just make sure 98% of all people stay away from it.

Is this related to bitcoin? Also carriers could always triangulate your position from the cell towers. It's neccesary for their technical operation.

Pretty much the title of this post. Only affects bitcoin
