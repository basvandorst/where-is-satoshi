Thank you for the advice! Absolutely! It will be a controlled investment.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:15:09
Thank you for the advice! I am trying to learn as much as possible.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:10:12
Thank you for the information!
I was not even aware of this functionality. 
I plan to get a hardware wallet as my more long term hodling wallet in the near future. Would you recommend Trezor?
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:57:48
Thank you for the reassuring words!
This sub has been so kind to me and very helpful as I make my journey
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:09:25
Thank you for.the advice! Haha. 
Made my first purchase and ready to make more while I hodl (:
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:59:16
Thank you for the link!
What do you like about electrum as opposed to Mycelium?
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:23:22
Thanks for being so helpful! Yikes! I will do some searching tonight when I get home and hopefully find one that is decently priced.
 Is it a terrible idea to go ahead and make my first BTC purchase without having the hardware wallet yet, just for the sake of getting my investment in there?
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:48:35
Very cool! Is it a bad idea to purchase my BTC before I've got the offline wallet? Or should I just get with my initial purchase today as well
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:53:17
Thank you for the advice! Backup the seed to an external hard drive?
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:04:16
Hahaha magic internet potatoes!
I got home and made my first purchase. Dabbled with a little btc dice(cause why not have some fun) and negated those pesky transaction fees. 
Time to Hodl (:
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:56:52
Thank you for the advice!
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:14:19
Thank you for the detailed advice! I intend to invest several hundred nearly 1k per month until i have at least 1.5 btc.
 I have seen Trezor suggested by many(you included), I should get everything from my exchange to it ASAP, correct?
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:55:58
Thank you for the suggestion!
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:45:31
Thank you for the advice! I have been looking at those as well (particularly LTC as it seems to be the better long term choice to me) 
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:08:34
Absolutely! 
Thank you for the contribution.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:44:40
Thank you for the advice! I have been one of those people long enough and will be investing when I get home from work today.
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:55:44
I understand better now.
Thank you for the information!
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:14:45
Thank you for the advice! I do not plan to day trade ;p
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:52:34
Thank you for the advice. I am planning to be a long term (multiple year) hodler.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:54:14
Thank you for the advice! I intend to be a long term(many years) hodler.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:28:55
Without this is my wallet 'not safe'.
Obviously not as safe as it could be but is it in danger?
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:00:40
Completely new but I think I almost have this figured out.
Given the current transfer fees, how much BTC should I transfer to desktop/hardware wallet at a time (from Coinbase) in order for.it.to be worth it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:58:43
Ah, I did not know that! I was under the impression that it was instant. I suppose I will make my purchase though and see how the fees look!
If I purchased today but it takes a week, do I get the listed price at the time of purchase or the price when transferred in a week?(probably a dumb question)
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:10:57
Thank you for the advice!! Stories like this are inspiring, keep on hodling!
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:08:06
Thank you for the confidence, links, and the funny meme haha!
Got home and made my first purchase. Time to make many smaller ones in.the future and most of all.... Hodl (:
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:24:29
Just the way I have seen its behavior via price tracking charts as compared to other crypto and other research, I believe that it will achieve a somewhat steady long term gain.
Not to say that ETH won't do this, but through similar analysis I believe it is more conductive to shorter term trading, which I am not looking to do. I want to buy it and sit on it.
Of course this is just an opinion! I plan to diversify with both.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:18:31
Thank you for the advice! Are most hardware wallets around that price range? I would like to ensure that my investment will stay safe in the long term.
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:08:24
Thank you for the advice!!
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:33:24
Thank you for the advice! I have been interested for a while and my newfound income stream has pushed me into finally doing it.

Mycelium android wallet now supports customizable tx fees
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:20:59
This is very helpful, thank you for all the information! 
Is Electrum such a wallet(one which can have the fee customized)? I have heard good things about it.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:14:52
Thank you for the info!
I am American so I suppose I will look into Gemini. Do you know of any android wallets that have low tx fees?
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:38:32
Oh wow! This seems very cool, I will definitely do some research into it when I'm home from work today. 
Thank you so much for your help!
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:05:04
Thanks for the input! I need a new printer anyway!
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:04:35
Good point! Thank you for the response
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:41:21
Wow! Thank you so much for all the information! I too enjoy the simplicity of Mycelium.
It is good to learn as much as I can in order to ensure the longevity of my investment. I will definitely look into these exchanges!

If I can purchase my value packs with btc instead of pearls I will be a happy man
