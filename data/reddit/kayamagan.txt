thanks.  as far as you know that can work in the UK?  I didn't have much confidence in shift customer support to attend to oversea travel...

US resident, thanks again.. I was hoping there would be resources for UK vendors that accept btc/ltc but as far as a back up plan for VISA usage that indeed offers some salvation...  Only other thing is that it binds me to the WF account in order to keep the Shift card open....

is this feasible?  how would you print it?  Im not sure a screen printer can get that detailed...  would you have to do direct to garment?

do you have advice for venezolanos in the US about how they can learn about btc to send to their family?  my spanish is not good but talked to a few people, and they are using a system (maybe similar to hawala) where they are giving $ to someone in the US and then the family is given Bs in VZ by someone... sound familiar?  I don't understand how but anyways, I am trying to open the conversation about getting their family and BTC wallet to avoid this...
