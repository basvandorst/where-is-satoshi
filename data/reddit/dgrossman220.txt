Problem solved, Localbitcoins reinstated my account and gave me access to my bitcoin.  Just took way too long IMO.  Still a good idea to withdraw your bitcoin immediately!

FTR my bank was great, they scanned my original receipt, printed them on official bank letter head, wrote this transaction was never reversed, wrote the transaction number of the transaction that was reversed on the sellers account, and stamped it with the official bank stamp.  
That is why the seller gave up his fraudulent claim.  I forgot to mention that the seller that made the fraudulent claim is still selling with no recourse.

What do you consider to be a "legit" exchange?
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:03:08
Not yet, hopefully in the future, not sure why localbitcoins has such a solid rep
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:43:53
Those options don't have any volume in my country

If you don't have access to get funds on coinbase, bitstamp, kraken, etc how would you suggesting buying bitcoin?  Craigslist?

Similar situation is happening to me on Localbitcoins 
Best of luck to you and any help is greatly appreciated

Let's hope, but they usually respond to basic tickets within 24 hours.  This problem was solved 108 hours ago and still no response...

Yeah, LBC has the power to remove feedback subjectively.  So the feedback scores are kinda irrelevant.  Tbh I have had smoother transactions with many 96-98% guys than the 100%ers.

They reinstated my account and let me withdraw my bitcoin.  Only took 1 week and 4 hours to do so
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:11:48
What other exchanges would you recommend for buying and selling for cash?
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:21:09
Yes, it is very very dangerous, LocalBitcoins also acts incredibly favorable to traders with high volume.  Understandable for their bottom-line in the short term.  Will be disastrous long-term 
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:41:26
Hodl Hodl doesn't have any volume where I live
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:37:29
You are right, unfortunately we aren't quite there yet.   Hopefully one day soon!

The guy that attempted to scam me had over 1000+ trades and a 100% score.  Granted he did have 7 negative reviews.
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:02:12
Yep, I feel you, the thing that is shocking here is the seller withdrew his complaint and admitted guilt (that I paid in full and my transaction was not reversed) in the chat.  Now it is simply localbitcoins that is unjustly holding my bitcoins.

Thanks Vera, this issue was solved although it did take over 1 week and support did take over 4 days and 12 hours to clear my account after absolute proof was given and the seller withdrew his protest. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:39:57
What did LBC say?  Did they try to help?
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:19:20
Bitcoin is.  I thought I could trust [localbitcoins.com]( to not steal from me, I may have been wrong
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:48:16
I am willing to join your class, is it too late to join? Localbitcoins stole 3.5 bitcoins from me.

Not quite sure what you mean about long-term hold.  They act as an escrow to protect both parties.  From now on I am immediately withdrawing after I make a purchase.  
My mistake was waiting for a couple purchases to come through to save on the transaction fee, but now I will simply withdraw immediately and take the tx fee hit.  
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:37:31
I was well aware of the 3rd party risks, just trusted localbitcoins, could be a huge mistake.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:10:15
Did he have any BTC in his wallet?
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:36:43
Without a doubt
