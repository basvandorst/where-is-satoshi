The app icon. The white lines are faint and don't stand out. Doesn't make want to click it. Needs more contrast like the Reddit / coinbase/ Uber app buttons. Just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:10:06
Great app , could use a nicer app button.
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:38:03
I made a top list  of how many  subscribers  there were in begging of May , then updated it in June and now July
@_date: 2018-07-01 22:23:17
Nice �� that means there is money to make in video games my friend not crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-02 06:50:04
I manually looked at all the 100 sub reddits and wrote down how many subscribers they had. I know some websites like coinlib track Reddit numbers, but I haven't seen historical data like on CoinMarketCap.
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:14:40
I love how instagram asks me if I want to promote my "awesome" post. But then tells me that my crypto content is not by their guidelines. Ok thanks facebookagram
