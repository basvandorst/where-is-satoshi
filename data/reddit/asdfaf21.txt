Do I need to be a member of one of those banks for this method to work? I only have an account at my local credit union, because I do not believe much in banks, or "credit" of any kind for that matter

Thank you for pointing that out. What should I call it? A bitcoin service? I do not know the proper terminology

I don't have a credit score to my knowledge. I have never owned a credit card, never taken out a loan, bought all my cars with cash. I always pay my rent, power and water/trash/gas/internet/phone bills on time though. I'm just not really a believer in the whole "loan" idea. I don't like banks, and I like being given money in advance even less. I don't like to be paid until my job is done. It doesn't feel right and there is too much to go wrong. I like my system. The only things I can ever see myself taking out loans for in the future are for a home and business if need be

I have emailed them. I was unable to find coinbase's telephone number, would you be able to point me in the right direction? I am going to call circle in the morning when their phone lines are open
