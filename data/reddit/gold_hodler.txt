Bitcoin is not a "get out of taxes" card. If it's income, you're taxed on it regardless of the currency you're paid in. Bitcoin would make tax evasion easier theoretically, but tax evasion is still illegal and no one here is going to help you cheat on your taxes.
Also FYI: regardless of what you're paid in your employer is going to report how much he paid you to your respective tax bureau. He has to, and it's in his best interest to do so, as your salary is a legitimate business expense s/he can claim on *their* taxes.

You know, has seen a rise of fake posts and tip whoring since Changetip came into vogue. This is balanced a bit here because the average poster is still a genuine enthusiast of the technology and so some decent discussion still happens in those threads.
But expand that Reddit wide, with a token system that literally no one is passionate about and is extremely limited in scope but still has a real financial value, and I could see the quality of genuine posts actually being detrimentally impacted by this.

The constant pumping and dumping at others' expense, the misleading promises to lure people in, the vitriol towards any criticism, and scamming *does* do harm though. I was a dedicated crypto fan and still hold a few coins, but aspects of the Bitcoin community right honestly make me feel uncomfortable that my investment in Bitcoin enables these things. 
I respect the technology and honestly believed it could make a difference. It's not the entire Bitcoin community of course, and there are those I respect a lot. But there are far far too many behaviours in crypto that are just accepted that I cannot in good conscience reinforce by putting more money in at this point.

Usually as you approach retirement you shift your investment strategy into safer more predictable investments, and once you're retired, you want to really play it on the safe side.

As much as I respect what Sean's Outpost does, I think an officially registered charity is best for two main reasons:
 Recognizability. If you're tipping on youtube or a different subreddit "The United Way" will be recognized immediately by anyone as a good organization. Basically, it's better PR for Changetip and Bitcoin if non Bitcoin people recognize the charity.
 That way Changetip could claim those charity contributions on their income tax against their earnings. This is legal: supermarkets do it with all of the $1 donations they collect from customers at the till. I know a lot of Bitcoiners are gonna hate me for mentioning this, but honestly it gives an incentive to Changetip to make this happen and devote time and manpower to organizing the charity donations. Basically it makes it a win/win/win for everyone involved.

I use credit cards for everything. I pay it off in full each month so I never pay interest.
Why? 2% cash back, automatic extended warranties on all my purchases, buyer protection, unlimited monthly transactions with no fees paid by me, travel + out of country medical insurance if I use my card to book my flight with, etc. etc. etc.
People use credit cards for other reasons than the "credit" aspect of it. Sure I could use debit, but as a consumer credit cards have many advantages... unless you don't pay them off, in which case they're not worth it.

"I insured the vehicle used by my business in my own name to save money." (paraphrased)
I hate to be the one to tell him this, but this means he literally isn't insured at all. If anything were to ever happen to that RV: a break in, theft, an accident, or heaven forbid someone gets hurts by it or in it and there's a lawsuit, then when he tried to file a claim he'd be found to be in breach of his insurance due to it being used primarily as a work vehicle and not a personal vehicle as he claimed when he purchased the insurance. Trust me, insurance companies are VERY good at finding reasons not to pay, and this is a glaringly obvious one that they'd discover in minutes.
So a car accident would likely bankrupt Sean's Outpost, especially if there was a lawsuit involved since there's no way his insurance will pay a dime with the way he has things set up. I for one would hate to see that happen.

When I post in it's usually an innocuous joke (not at anyone's expense) or a genuine attempt at discussion because I believe introspection is important for improvement. I do try to remain polite and honest, and not post anything just to get a rise out of people... I don't find much fun in being a jerk, honestly.
So why do I frequent Because I disagree with some of the culture of and find it troubling that my investment enables this. I'm talking about the constant pump and dumpers, those who actively root for the collapse of the state (I like Bitcoin, but I don't want to see the rest of the world's savings wiped out so it can succeed!) and those who push really terrible financial advice on those who can't afford it and are vulnerable, and so on. The only time I've ever been outright nasty (well besides in this thread too, maybe) here is to someone trying to sell snake oil (water with a minute amount of silver in it) as a "cure" for Ebola, but I would have done that anywhere even in person. 
Meh... Maybe this is a more sincere answer than you were looking for, i don't know. I just wish it was possible to have different viewpoints here without being labelled a troll and everything I say being disregarded. I mean hell, I was accused of being a statist for encouraging people to educate themselves about their candidates and get out and vote if they want to have a voice in the regulations discussions. 
We all have different frames of references from the lives we've lived. can be a discouraging place if you don't share the same libertarian/crypto anarchist leanings of many of the more vocal members and that's *really* unfortunate, as it leads to an echo chamber of values that push out the common person.

Short answer: no.
Long answer: Both Dell and Microsoft are publicly traded companies. This means they have to answer to their shareholders for their mistakes and misjudgements. With Bitcoin as volatile as it is at the moment no one in those two companies are going to literally put their job on the line by keeping any funds in Bitcoin for any amount of time.
Their shareholders would tear them apart if they held funds in Bitcoin and the value declines. Bitcoin would have to be stable on a multi year scale before they could justify keeping any funds in it to their investors.

It's a first of its kind case, so expect decisions like this that adhere very strictly to the letter of the law as it is written, without interpretation. 
Ideally if people want to fix the system you should pay attention to times like this when the letter of the law (in this case that the server was on foreign soil and not owned by a US citizen so a warrant wasn't necessary) has implications that you disagree with and then bring those concerns to your elected officials. Your elected officials have the power to change the letter of the law that the courts have to abide by. Remember that.

Plenty of my friends have interests I don't share, and vice versa, and that's okay.

The worries about a deflationary currency are not solely about people's willingness to spend on consumer products. Inflation is also a method to channel people into methods of saving that benefit the economy as a whole - to beat inflation people instead invest in companies (allowing them to grow), government insured bonds, etc. These are very important methods of raising funds for the businesses invested in, making it (ideally) a mutually beneficial exchange for all involved as the business then shares their profits in the form of dividends and increased stock value. One of the fears of a deflationary currency is that if removing your money from the economy entirely by just holding onto it is a valid savings model then this would theoretically put businesses in deflation currency based states at a disadvantage as they will not have as much capital available as companies in inflationary states do, due to a lack of investing.

The first time I was accused of being a troll was for encouraging people to get out and vote in their local elections, because being known as a bloc that doesn't vote means it's safe for politicians to ignore you and your desires entirely. I've never trolled in my life; I'm a believer in the tech but a critic of the scams/constant pumping/vitriolic libertarian evangelists/insanity within the Bitcoin community. 
Sadly it's not even criticism of Bitcoin itself that gets you labeled a "troll" and downvoted here... often it's enough to state that you actually hope the state *doesn't* collapse in the near future. I'm sorry I can't get behind daydreams of the life savings of everyone I care about being wiped out, no matter how interesting I find the tech.

An honest answer:
VC money is literally a gamble. They play with different odds than you or I: a 1/15 chance of earning a profit is considered really, really good in VC terms, since if they DO earn a profit they earn a lot of it. I remember reading an interview with a VC where he was bragging about having a 1/13 profitability ratio for his investments, when the average VC hovers around 1/25.
That's not to say that they don't do their research and make the smartest decisions they can, because they do... It's just the business world is really, really tough. The big thing is their ratio of success is on such a different scale than the common person because their payout terms are also on a different scale if things do go right.

"Young" is a relative term, especially when we're talking about the age of someone's death. The person in question was my Grandfather, who passed away at 48. In many ways I'd say he is an outlier, in that the man was the heaviest smoker I've ever met in my life, but at the same time he was a good man and I miss him enough not to wish to make money off the industry that contributed to his death.
As I said though it's a personal choice of mine, and I don't think badly of anyone else who is a smoker or invests in it. I just sleep better at night if I'm not actually contributing to it, you know?

Sometimes people need to make the decision that helps them sleep at night, rather than the one that might be more profitable. For example I try to maintain an ethical investment portfolio, in particular avoiding investing in anything to do with tobacco due to losing one of my closest family members to lung cancer at a young age due to smoking. It's a personal choice, and one that costs me profit I'm sure (it's amazing how many funds include tobacco companies. It has come up a LOT), but that's the cost of sleeping at night.
I'm not saying he views Bitcoin the same way I view investing in tobacco. We've all probably taken a financial loss on something at some point just so we can move on and stop obsessing over it in the dark hours of the night, and that could be the point here. More it's more of a stress avoidance tactic maybe. 
Sleeping at night (whether because you voted with your wallet or because you're mitigating the things that cause you stress personally) is sometimes more important than a potential lottery ticket.

Eh... Challenging a journalist to gamble 2-3 years worth of their salary because you disagree with an article they wrote and then (presumably) claiming afterwards that their refusal to gamble displays anything other than them not being batshit insane *is* weird. 
Other Bitcoiners have written line by line refutations of the original article. While I don't agree with all of their points, I do respect their approach a lot more than this one. One is saying "you're wrong and here's (hopefully) testable reasons why I believe that" and the other is saying "oh yeah buddy? If you're wrong then you have to buy me a small house!" 
Honestly the times I'm most nervous about an idea is when everyone agrees from the start. I'm always much more confident if an idea has stood the test of opposition and come out the other side intact or improved. It's why I choose to work with people who think differently then I do: I *want* those opposing viewpoints, and find them incredibly valuable to the long term success of my goals. A large portion of the Bitcoin community reacts much too emotionally to any perceived criticism, which is almost always means a lost opportunity to educate or at least build goodwill among the undecided spectators of the squabble.

Mods won't be removed for those reasons. I think the only recourse users of a sub have is if a mod actually abandons a sub for a certain period of time. 
As an example of how crazy this can get: a subreddit for a web comic based primarily around science, was run by a group of holocaust deniers and neo nazis, and the community couldn't get rid of them. I wish I was joking. The creator of the webcomic himself even tried to talk to reddit admins about it with no success. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:06:22
Thank you. I believe strongly that an idea should be sold on its merits, and not on half truths.

It makes the whole thing seem untrustworthy and less honest. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:48:26
You're probably right that it'll never be close to perfect, but as we've seen in the past law enforcement is capable of using ways other than the actual currency transactions to catch criminals. Maybe a criminal tries to cash out their stolen Bitcoin through an undercover officer, maybe a secondary investigation uncovers that a perp stole a bunch of Bitcoin from people too. I'd encourage you to check out to see how often someone is nailed for one crime they would have gotten away with because they also committed some other much more obvious crime around the same time. It's so common that the lawyers there half jokingly reply "if you're going to commit a crime, only commit one at a time!" As a regular mantra. 
Besides, if you report cyber crimes maybe the police learn how to investigate it properly, maybe they don't. But if the crimes aren't even reported, that means they don't even know it's happening or is an issue, and then we're *guaranteed* that they'll never learn to investigate it/make it a priority. That just makes for more victims in the long run.
As an aside, I'm not a Bitcoin zealot (actually around here I get called a "troll" pretty often for holding critical/realistic opinions of Bitcoin) and I do agree with you that you are giving up a lot of protections by using Bitcoin vs. the traditional banking system. But I also don't like people being robbed, or criminals getting away scott free after stealing from someone. I may think a lot of Bitcoiners have some funny ideas, but I still don't wanna see them robbed of their money with no recourse, you know?

Since others have chimed in on security, I'll address my opinion to the other question in your post:
I'd say absolutely contact the police. Why not? You had the coins for a legal purpose, and had them stolen... you're a victim of a crime. Will they get you your Bitcoins back? I doubt it, but who knows, a one in a thousand chance is better than zero. Beyond that it creates a paper trail that the coins were in fact stolen for when it comes to taxes, heaven forbid a lawsuit against you, etc. I'm telling you right now if you're audited and they find records of these bitcoins and you claim they were stolen but didn't contact the police they're gonna assume the worst, because in their training someone who is robbed and doesn't contact police is a red flag.
Also, even if the police aren't great at dealing with cyber crimes yet (I honestly don't know if they are or aren't), they need to be shown that they need to get better at it, because this type of crime is real and isn't going away. If nobody reports, there'll be no changes in their priorities because they won't be aware the demand exists. Maybe by all of you guys reporting crimes today, you save yourselves a lot of trouble ten years from now when the police are now actually good at helping your community because they saw the need.
As a last point: imagine you're a criminal. There's a group of people who have decent amounts of money, and guess what? They don't even contact the police if you rob them! If you manage to rob them there's absolutely no potential for consequences! Holy shit, doesn't that sound amazing?! Yeah, it probably does, and while knowing the crime will be reported may not deter a more hardened criminal, it may deter a script kiddie with a future from pursuing a crime of opportunity against you. Also, why paint the targets on your back any larger than they need to be?
Anyways, sorry this happened to you. Being robbed sucks, and anyone blaming you for this is ignoring the bigger picture that if you, who researched and took pretty good steps to protect yourself, was robbed how are you expecting the layperson who doesn't research anything to use Bitcoin safely? If something is only secure in the hands of security experts then it's not secure, and that's a point that can be improved upon. 
Tl;Dr: Call the police, and I'm a long winded bastard.

1. Play through your Steam library, earning cards.
2. Sell those cards on the Steam Marketplace. 
3. Buy in demand games off Steam with the money you earned selling cards. 
4. Sell those Steam keys for Bitcoin. 
Honestly that's probably be the highest earning (though still *incredibly* low) way of converting game time into Bitcoin. As an added bonus, you could play games that are actually, you know, fun. 
It'd still be incredibly inefficient compared to something like taking on some odd jobs for cash and converting that to Bitcoin, but I suppose you could earn a very very small amount this way.

I won't deny that there are some over in who troll over here. (Disclosure: I participate often on Buttcoin.) But there are also a lot of people like myself over there: people who have/had high hopes for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, but are turned off by some of the politics of the community. For myself I actually think Bitcoin has a lot of potential, and wouldn't be surprised to see it take off. I just can't get behind the extreme libertarian/ancap politics espoused here, and need a place where I can go and say "I like Bitcoin, but you know, I really don't want the state to collapse and for everyone I know to lose their life savings and become paupers because they weren't early adopters" without receiving nasty PMs about how I'm a horrible statist with Stockholme syndrome from "sucking the Fed's cock too much" (to quote a post from yesterday). I participate in both and to find a measure of balance between cynicism and euphoria. 
By the way, if you're ever curious about Poe's law on a post, you can always check and it'll usually be called out if it is trolling... "This has to be one of us, right?" Is a very common response to many of the posts over there, and usually someone will own up to it if it is.
For the record, I don't like trolling and don't participate. This is my only account I use on the Crypto boards, and while I may have differences of opinion with members of the community here, I'm still here because I find the tech interesting.

I'm not saying he did or didn't, as I'm not familiar with the case. But sadly suicide often comes as a shock to those around the person because things did seem to be getting better for them. In some cases this is because making the actual decision to go forward with suicide can actually bring a sense of relief and energy to the person, while in other cases it can actually be the case that a person was too immobilized by depression/anxiety/mental health issues while they were at their worst, and it's only when they start to be more capable of action through ironically feeling a bit better that they can actually put their plans for suicide into action. 
Suicide is a tricky, tricky thing to nail down, honestly. I've worked with quite a few suicidal individuals over the years, and it's never as cut and dry as it seems from the outside. 
One other fact to consider is that society has the belief that all suicides are planned well in advance. While many are, studies of suicide survivors have found that for many there is an incredibly short time between the first suicidal thought and action - I'm talking like 15 minutes or so. That's an incredibly small window of opportunity for that person to receive or seek help, and truthfully there is a lot of confusion amongst medical professionals as to how to address and prevent these types of suicide. 
Suicide sucks. There's no shame in seeking help when anything tries to kill you, even if it's your own brain.

The darknet markets do have some moral quandaries beyond the sale of recreational drugs:
Cyanide was allowed on the Silk Road. This question was raised amongst DPR and the admins, and their discussions and decision to allow it to be sold on the site are available online if you look. 
Another example is the sale of stolen credit cards, which is common on darknet markets. 
A third example is that some of the prescription drugs sold that have legitimate medical uses and are advertised as being a foreign generic brand have turned out to have very low amounts of the active ingredient when tested, or none at all. This could cause obvious health problems for someone who requires the medication and turns to the DNM in order to be able to afford it due to it being too expensive in their own country. 
People who use prescription medication recreationally can make it more difficult for a legitimate patient to be prescribed something they need, due to the fear amongst the medical community of drug seeking behaviour. 
Then there's the reality that with some exceptions while the DNMs may be safer for the end purchaser than traditional buying off the street, the source of many of the drugs remain the same as before with cartels and criminal enterprises which are huge destabilizing issues in the countries they're in. 
There's more, obviously. I'm actually not anti drug, and believe in the legalization of certain drugs that are currently illegal, but I thought I would chip in with some negatives because I'm sure you'll get enough positives from others here. Figured I'd help you write a more nuanced paper and maybe get a better grade. :)

As someone who actually has contacts in Nepal, this isn't going to work. Most of the people I know are currently living in tents outside of their towns/cities, as the buildings are too damaged and there are still aftershocks that could cause buildings to collapse on people if they stay in them. They don't have access to infrastructure right now... The first contact I received to let me know that the people I work with had survived was only yesterday, as that was literally the first opportunity they had to access email. This are people I would consider affluent and very well off compared to their neighbours, so if they don't have access neither does the common person. 
Right now your money is best served being donated to an aid agency that does not have a political agenda. This is vitally important, as Nepal geography makes it a constant tug of war for influence from China and India, and aid may come with future strings attached from other parties.

This is a perfect example of how unnecessarily wasteful gold is. If this was Bitcoin, the thieves wouldn't have needed:
 A vehicle capable of carrying the gold. 
 To burn gas while driving to and away from the scene of the crime. 
 To leave their house. 
 To worry about getting caught. 
It just blows me away that we're still not seeing the benefits of Bitcoin in September of 2015.

What if you added an option to donate your earned coins to a registered charity that accepts Bitcoin like The Red Cross or Ronald McDonald House? It could help you get some press and word of mouth from people not already into Bitcoin. Also, as an added bonus you could probably claim the amount donated by your users on your end of year taxes to help offset expenses. I'd verify the legality of that first, but I'm pretty sure it's legal as I know grocery stores claim the donations they take at the till. 
A piece of advice on the name, too: I'd avoid any combination of the words "fit" and "bit", since your app would never break the SEO hold Fitbit has on Google, and you'd be on like page ten. A shame, really, because "Fitbit" would have been a perfect name for your app, honestly.

He wrote an update about how successful accepting Bitcoin has been for his business. The numbers weren't good, but he stated he still was positive on Bitcoin and had no intention of dropping it because he believes in Bitcoin. He encouraged people to spend Bitcoin at merchants and not just brigade them to accept it then never make a purchase. People attacked him for the post, calling him a troll and all sorts of nasty names for posting his store's stats, as some people viewed it as a non positive post about Bitcoin. Someone called him a Buttcoiner for some reason, despite my never having seen him on Buttcoin before. He made a joke post on that said "I guess I'm one of you guys now!", and the Buttcoin mods made him a mod for a few hours as a joke. 
People lost their shit, and have been attacking him nonstop ever since.

I suppose I meant more a discussion between experts rather than academia per se. See this exchange in earlier today for an example of two people who academically disagree, and yet conduct themselves with respect towards the other party and a clear purpose of discovering the best answer rather than being proven right: 
Does this always happen? No, obviously not. But when intelligent people work together to respectfully find the best answer, even if that means admitting they weren't as correct as they initially thought, we all win. It's an ideal of the scientific method, and one I believe greatly assists efforts to improve our knowledge. 
I cede your point that there have been some very, very opinionated and stubborn academics though. The ideal is still worth pursuing however!

They're not talking about capital gains. What this article is stating is that the purchase of bitcoins themselves would incur sales tax at the time of purchase. Then, when those bitcoins are exchanged for goods or services, that is also a taxable event. 
Eg: I buy $50 worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase. Coinbase would charge me $53.50 - $50 for The Bitcoin +7% tax. 
I then go to a store that accepts Bitcoin, and spend my Bitcoin. This is also a taxable event, and 7% tax will have to be paid on this purchase price too. 
Capital gains is a whole different issue, this is sales tax they're talking about.

If you keep your standards high, keep focussed on the technological aspects, avoid all politics, and have a valid, respectable peer review process then I think this is a very interesting idea. 
One of the best things about academia is their willingness to be wrong, and be corrected by those with access to different research and fields. Bringing that level of discourse to a topic that has frankly been dominated by strong egos with a desire to loudly express their own currently held ideas rather than to be exposed to new ones could only be a good thing. 
Good luck, and avoid the temptation to be part of the pump!

That's the worst depiction of Mark Karpeles I've ever seen!
Just teasing. :)
Weird thought: I dated a fairly well known artist for a few years, and learnt quite a bit about how the higher end art market worked. One of the things I found interesting was the whole concept of preserving the value of sold work: every contract she signed with a gallery included clauses that her work was to always be sold in the future for the same value (or more) as it was to sold for at present. It was okay to increase prices of her work, but as soon as a piece sold she contractually was not allowed to ever sell a similar piece for less than the price of that sale, as it would devalue the previous purchaser's piece.
This brings up an interesting point: how would this work with a volatile currency? With your wife pricing things in Bitcoin, which fluctuates in value, would a gallery view this as a breach of the maintenance of value clause if the price crashed between the sale of two similar pieces? I actually find this interesting. 
Granted, this only effects a very, very small percentage of the artist population, but I'm super curious as to how it would work. Like even outside of Bitcoin, what happened to artists who sold their work in both USD and the Ruble as the Ruble fell in value? Would the artist be forced to continually change the Ruble price to ensure the value of the purchase price was the same? Would an international artist need to increase their prices in currencies that were falling in value if a similar piece had previously sold in a currency that remained stable?
Tl:Dr: The art world is weird and fascinating. Good luck to you and your wife.

My brother and I constantly tease each other about how much more we appreciate a quieter life with each passing year. Realizing that we find simple satisfaction in things like watering our lawn, tending our gardens, and enjoying a slow day was at first strange because of how driven we both were as younger men, and how incredibly busy we kept ourselves. Growing older can suck, but learning the peace of living at a less hectic pace has been one of the pleasant parts of it.

If Changetip went bankrupt, and assuming they owed more than they owned, they actually wouldn't have a choice. Since that information has value, it would as a matter of course be sold during the bankruptcy in order to recoup money for their creditors. 
Companies lose a lot of control when they declare bankruptcy, and part of the bankruptcy procedure is to convert anything of value into money that can be used to make creditors whole. 
Not saying they're going to declare bankruptcy anytime soon, just saying that if they do the information will be sold.

When you said you'd never done animation before, I expected a train wreck. You let me down, it was much better than I expected. 
Honest advice though: the section where you begin "many people believe that all important documents will be kept..." Was unnecessary, came out of nowhere, and muddied your message on that video. As well, the phrase "many people believe" has negative connotations as the phrase you use when you have no sources to back it up. It's a weasel phrase made most famous by Fox News for insinuating a common belief that doesn't actually exist.

That's actually a really strange idea, considering that many countries are currently creating tax free saving options as a way to encourage retirement savings.

Honestly, I'd probably put it into a different video. Up until that point the video hard been concise, easy to understand, and verifiable. Honestly it served as a good first introduction to Bitcoin, one that even I as a critic of the Bitcoin community couldn't argue with. For a first introduction video I feel it's important to stick to the facts and present them as simply and as uncomplicatedly as possible.  Perhaps have a seperate video entitled "future possibilities for the Blockchain" and include all of the "this doesn't exist yet, but the future of Bitcoin may include:" and then list them, how it could work, and why it is important. Let people go down the rabbit hole bit by bit so to speak. 
Honestly good luck. They're very watchable.

I remember there was a bar in town where you could go to their website and choose to buy a random person a beer. They also had a little kiosk with a webcam that people could go to and optionally say thank you for the beer that would then be posted on their site. I forget what their payment options were (this was about ten years ago so obviously no Bitcoin) and I have no idea how popular it was, but I remember the videos were pretty funny.
This nice thing is you had to buy a random person a beer, and not like someone you saw on a webcam prior or something. That could get creepy and weird fast. It was just a fun little thing that drew attention to their website. 
If a coffee shop wanted to I don't see why they couldn't set up something similar. They could probably set it up much easier than a bar could ten years ago for sure. If people actually used it it could make for a cool coffee house vibe, and a cool experience. Maybe have fancy mugs for the free coffee too, make it a fun thing. Maybe a nacho hat too. 
The problem would be getting people to purchase the gift coffees. If no one did, it'd just fizzle.
