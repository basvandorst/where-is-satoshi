Throttling? As in temperature? I have the latest Catalyst drivers and that gives me manual fan control. I've left it on automatic because I didn't know it would be shutting down due to heat. Maybe I should try it with a constant near-max fan speed.
Thanks for the help regardless!

Sorry! I meant I tried -d0, and then -d1. I haven't overclocked my gpu.
However, I read this forum post -  and perhaps it's the same problem or something similar so I've switched over to BitMinter as well. It doesn't seem to have any of the problems so far.

I added -d0 and -d1 and it went down to max 900 KH/s. However without the flag, the temperature is rising to 72C, but still no throttling, there's no usage drop at all. Still steady 380 MH/s. I only have 0 checked in CPU affinity out of 0 to 7, so maybe that's something to do with the CPU usage?
Edit: As an update, it happened again. But this time with Afterburner up, it showed that the gpu usage dropped to around 6% from ~98%, and in task manager my first cpu core was at 100% usage. If I stop and start the GUIMiner miner, it resets to 380 MH/s... strange. The temperature was a steady 72C. If throttling isn't the problem, what else could it be?

Ah, I see. It does get rather hot and I was wondering if that was normal. Thanks for the help, I've been a laptop gamer for the longest time and this is my first real desktop build, actually.

I'll do that when I return home, thanks! What would be something suspicious to look out for with speedfan?

I'm currently installing Afterburner but I have fans set to 90% speed in Catalyst, and the temperature seems to be locked at 66 degrees Celsius. My flags are "-v -w256 -f60" if that's important. Is anything wrong as far as you can see? Thanks again!
