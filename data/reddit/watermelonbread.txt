I have a small coinbase wallet with nothing in it right now. I do plan to use it, but I won't put bucket loads of coins in there.  The risk of an online wallet is too much for me, which is why I want to have a wallet I can sit on.

Use your mentality, and wake up to reality.

pull your head out of your ass. There's plenty of chaps who want to start on this bitcoin thing, but don't understand the basics. If we want this to grow, we need a larger foundation.

I was going to back it up like crazy, encrypt it, and store it safely elsewhere. 
So my question...do you have a wallet to spend bitcoin with, and another wallet to sit on and keep as back up? This way you transfer everything from your "savings account" wallet to your "checking account" wallet? I'm just having problems understanding what would be the SAFEST way to do both spend bitcoin, and save bitcoin.

Thanks for the advice!

hmmm. I've always played a defensive role with this. Seeing how the market is so young and has the potential grow, I may end doing this. Although I think I'll just put a tiny bit into it now just to see what happens with it. Thanks for the help! I'd tip but my wallet isn't set up yet.

Backing up your wallet prevents you from losing your wallet. But from what I understand, you're still vulnerable to theft, correct? So even if you back up your wallet, you're SOL if you become a victim to theft?

I should wait for the market to stabilize? I just feel that this is going to be another bubble. The first one is what gave me second guesses, but now I 
want to jump all over this.

So this would lead to an increase in price?
