No! Do not go ANYWHERE. If you have an opinion and you can back it by research, facts derived from research, with cited sources and then assumptions and/or inferences based on evidence, you DO THAT.
We need to have an open, robust dialogue. In the marketplace of ideas and technologies, blind evangelism won't win. We need to embrace the faults and the positives which this platform brings, and respect one another's opinions.
You do you, and do it with vigor and passion - the community needs it.
If someone needs to leave the room because they fear an idea or an opinion, their own belief system is rooted with insecurity and doomed for failure.

With a Pyramid, you have people on the top who own and collect assets and energy in the form of money from subordinates who recruit those with less capital and market exposure underneath them, to generate more.
This is more like a giant swimming pool of people who all have made, collectively, billions of dollars. However. The waves get restless, and some people drown in fear - or greed.

Do you believe that this is something, in 1 month, 1 year, 3 years, will be worth more than it is now?
With all of the upcoming improvements, growing market cap, expansion of new exchanges, new security enhancements, more nodes, more participants, more apps, more accepting vendors, more business investment, more futures, more ETF's, more .... lots of things.
Money in any form and its exchange value is a concentration of ENERGY, of MOMENTUM.
If you believe in the long run this is going to "Win" the game, that is it going to be a valid store of value, that it is going to be something every E-Store will accept as an alternative to the USD... That in the long run, this will FORCE institutional change and will DEMAND that the nature and transparency of money changes so that we can hold accountable the thousands of criminals, state agents and corrupt business from ruining the lives of the people they base their operations in...
If you believe that the people of Venezuela, Chad, Congo, China, Myanmar, all of the repressive regimes of the world who struggle, under Dictatorships which are ruining their lives, families and estates, are not deserving of a global, 21st century asset that enables them to realize VALUE and realize WEALTH to escape their situation, only brought to them by the origin of their birth...
If you believe this is something good, then the least you can do it throw in what you would have spent on a 6-pack of beer, on a Panda Express Meal, or on some frivolous purchase you shouldn't be making anyways.
If not, then don't even start. Make good decisions and research, invest, and hold wisely.
I remember when this was a $50 = 1 Bitcoin purchase. That day, I didn't go out to a super expensive restaurant... I cooked at home. The next week, I made a similar choice. Sometimes weekly, sometimes monthly.
That was the best decision of my life. $50, $100, or $20 even is worth the spectacle of something new emerging.

I'm not sure if you are serious or not. Before inflation, the average return on the US Total Stock Market hovers between 9.8 and 11% (inflation is -1 or -2.5% average per year).

Brother, $VTSAX or $VTI (Google it!)
Why take on the risk of picking and choosing stocks when you can just buy an Index, or a Mutual Fund tracking, the entire S&amp;P 500 and/or US Total Stock Market?
We're in the longest Bull Market to date now, if you had any amount of money invested in 2011-2012, it would have more than doubled by now (not accounting for Dividends and Income re-invested).
It's not "Bitcoin" fast, but its far more stable for those of us with familes, mortgages and all that fun stuff - which is the same cost, regardless if we're over 9000 or not, see what I mean?
It's totally, 100% fine to speculate with Bitcoin - but its important to be bearish on it and to diversify investments in the event of a collapse or drastic price decrease of one or another.

If you are spending money to invest it in an asset, you are doing so because the long-term value is there after extensive research.
If you are speculating and gambling with money into an asset, you are going to lose - or get lucky.
There is a difference. Let people Pump and Dump, but I recommend "Zooming Out" on the chart. Like with anything, only pour in what you can afford to lose. Good luck stranger!

Honestly, our competition is large Money groups which are entirely alien to trading in an environment that is 24/7, with 5-10% hourly swings.
That can mean 2 things.
Increased Volatility, or Increased Institutional Ownership of the underlying asset.
The two aren't mutually exclusive, but we've seen it in the last few days. These groups won't invest money is anything that isn't tangible for a certain % of invested asset to make a certain capital return, both in SRP and LRP (Short and Long Range Planning).
Getting a board of directors or an oversight committee for these highly regulated bodies to sign off on skinning single or low double digit %'s on an unregulated crypto asset 24/7 is a really, really tough call. The likely scenario is there is a position plan more LRP oriented, which is to hold the asset and realize a return on it that is in line with historical trends.
You can probably guess, some of my friends live in NYC, and drive very nice cars (

I want everyone to consider something quite radical.
We have, on average, ~28,000 people viewing this subreddit at any given time.
Imagine if we all auto-bought, daily or weekly, an amount of Bitcoin. "Dollar Cost Averaging". You budget it out per month, then you execute it.
In the last 1 hour, Bitcoin went up in value the same as you'd expect from investing in the S&amp;P 500 Stock Market Index - and waiting a year, after inflation, ON AN AVERAGE OF OVER 10 YEARS (Ups and Downs, Per Year).
That is how we not only drive value upwards, but also get the wheels of innovation and adaptation going.
Guy who's held since 50-100 / coin and is always amused when 13-15k 20-33% swing is a panic button situation. You got this guys, I believe in you!

Because you can't view it in raw $'s, you have to view it in swings of %'s.
That opens my eyes, at least, to capitalizing on buying opportunities.

Terrible advice. "Very Low Risk". If this helps you rationalize your decisions / sleep at night that's fine, but keep that internal. 
I sincerely hope you understand its a VERY HIGH RISK, but HIGH REWARD type of speculation.
IF you understand that, go ahead and invest 5% of your income. I'm an early adopter when coins were mineable and buying 100's or 1000's at a time was the price of a night out. So IDGAF, but I've seen some shit man. 
Money, Speculation and using absolutes like "oh yeah bitcoin is very low risk high reward" is stupid.
Consider that 5% of your income could very well translate to 20%, 25%, 33%, or more of your total investment portfolio. Now, if you mean "Out of your total investment portfolio, Crypto at 5% of THAT"... Now you're talking sense.

A lot of USD (Day Job), 5% of each paycheck has gone into Crypto since the "Early Days" before we hit our "Unsustainable" 1000 ATH peak.
Currently, 80% of my holdings are in Bitcoin, 20% are in Ethereum. I sold all my LTC after owning significant amounts of it when it first popped up, "Some Dirty Alt-Coin" but the price was a few cents per coin. Bought a few thousand of those. Sold the moment the "Great Manipulator" announced selling his founding coins on twitter. Phew.
The rest of my income (40-45% / paycheck) goes into very classic investments, both in 401k/Roth IRA and then also in Taxable Accounts with Vanguard (US Large, Medium and Small Cap - Growth, US Bond - Tax Exempt, US Aggressive Income, International Emerging and International All Market).
It's very, very safe to say Crypto has won this battle between 2013 and now. I'm 100% ready for it all to go to 0%, but willing to use it when I need it.

BTC is a manifestation of market drivers, fears, greed, patience, humility and human quality, but its spun up 100X the speed a world over because of the instant and decentralized nature of the market in its rawest form.
This is the same exact human behavior we see with the ACTUAL stock, bond, real estate, gold, forex, etc. markets - except those crawl over months or years with the same kind of up and down swings.
The 2007-2009 recession was a -39.99% market drop, it took 1.5 years to recover back to pre-recession levels
This is the ultimate free market, free-of-government experiment
As I type this, it went from 8600~ to 9300~ on GDAX.
We got this guys.
EDIT: And we're almost back at 10,000 (9899.00). Yay Capitalism

Exactly, find out how much you are willing to lose / not exist on a weekly basis, and invest it - each week.

My crypto investment is tiny compared to my total Net Worth brother.
Besides, a Lambo is a depreciating asset. I'm not a car guy. I'd rather buy a home outright, and have enough money to live off of without fear of being homeless. Not a big spender / flashy lifestyle guy.

The US market crashing 39.99% one year and almost entirely recovering the next 2 years didn't just impact us, it sent the world into a deep recession where many parts are only now, ~10 years later, recovering. That's a minor economic event, yet it cut so deep, so long.
Deep social spending cuts and austerity measures in many developed and non-developed countries have literally doomed a generation of kids. Even in the states, the impact of a non-depressive, but very strong market recession, was severe.
If the US economy failed, the world economy fails. Not because of the monetary and goods exchange halting, but because the Western, NATO/EU/Anglo sphere of influence, along with its defense pacts, free trade deals, freedom of movement, intellectual property, intelligence arrangements and containment policies around genuinely hostile, authoritarian nation states - shits all gone.
A world without US Hegemony is a terrifying place in the modern world.
Collapse would be absolutely catastrophic.
Additionally, this entire "Trumps Policy" narrative is interesting but not a primary driver of US influence and operations around the world. Specifically because the functioning, controlling / regulating elements of our government work so well. Not only is the Executive functionally and strategically isolated, but its on borrowed time.

Somewhat true. Historically, during times of inflation, CD's, Municipal Bonds and even Savings Accounts had higher rates of return than any Growth, Dividend, Income Hybrid, etc. assets.
In fact, periods of high inflation have historically futile / sad returns in market, with or without reinvesting dividends.
