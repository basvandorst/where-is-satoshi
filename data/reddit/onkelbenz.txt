There were bread lines in communists states, because it's impossible for central planner to set the price accordingly. For bread! Today most people trust central planning to globally set the price for money.

that's why you need an incremental cash out strategy (10 years before retirement) because crashes can happen any time

You also pay for blood tests and whatnot. Good for you it worked, but 1200 dollar would probably have included regular checkups.

Since no one seems to read the article (understandable as it is German) let me give you a tl;dr and a brief overview of Peter Bofinger (the German Paul Krugman without a Nobel Prize): With a no-cash economy he wants to dry out the black market and of course drugs are cited as bad examples. For the state it's a great way to control even more of our life and grab more money from us via taxes. That's the whole gist of it. No reason to get excited about. He teaches economy and sees the real world as his playground. 
Bofinger is the most prominent scholar of Keynes and a [2004 article]( cites him as the *last Keynesian* and after the 2008 crisis he got a bit more headlines with outrageous claims and ideas on how to fix the economy (cash for clunkers was realized in Germany and later on in the US even when it was a failure here) since people were turning away from a Supply-Driven view of economy.

My understanding is that you use one or several paper wallet just for storing your coins. You'll rarely use those wallets to send money. The hardware will be used to actually send money on a regular basis. But for all wallets you have on your hardware you should have a paper backup as well in case of a failure.

What does it say? Can't you articulate your arguments? Are you in general pro free trade? Forget TTIP and TPP for a moment.

If a bank doesn't want to send your money for whatever reasons then it's up to you to sue and present the violation in the contract and the law in front of the jury. Our courts are very good. 
I bet their terms are vague and most banks don't have to send every amount of money to whatever destination, though. 
Choose another bank, then.

How is speculating on food bad? 
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:27:04
This has nothing to do with inept governments. They DO understand it but central banks with its inflation is the biggest political instrument for them.

They already made up their mind.

Thx for the sources but I'm not convinced at all. Evil is a harsh word for those activities. 
1. Speculating on food is good like it is on any other good. It determines prices in the future. It's actually a perfect indicator for customers and farmers alike to prepare for more demand if otherwise food gets too expensive. 
2. So they pulled some tricks on the stupid co2 tax. Like I said, I couldn't care less. They didn't lie to their customers. They just want to save money with better strategic investments, otherwise the shareholders (customers) would castrate the bank. If the state puts so much barriers on banks it's a normal outcome. Everyday Joe breaks laws everyday too.
3. Satirical newspaper but it presents the mindset of common folks towards banks and confirms my theory that banks are easily described as evil whereas other business and state institutions are forgiven all the time

We don't need shit like this. We just need a real free market. I don't need forced protection.

If bitcoin community pulls a stunt like this then I'm out! Typical German entitlement attitude. If you don't like your bank then choose another. If the state restricts bitcoins then who you going to call? The state?

Founding fathers believed in the rights given by god. Some libertarians adopted the idea, but just exchanged god with the universe/ nature without further explanation. It confuses people. 
A good introduction:

Privacy is a derivate of property rights, both intellectual and physical, and therefore the strengthen of the property rights will increase privacy.
Think Facebook: you can use it or you don't participate, fund another social network or whatever. Simple as that. Now we have governments seizing half of our property, setting up specific arbitrary "privacy rights" for companies like Facebook (one doesn't need to accept the terms of any company) and the voters hail the new savior. Laugh. 
With real defending of property rights, what also includes 2 or more individuals agreeing to a contract, Lavabit would still exist.

Corrupt and evil in what way? Can you specify? Deutsche Bank was successful during the financial crisis and didn't use bailout money. If by corrupt you mean tax evasion, we might have different views on that matter. Because I couldn't care less about that.

No, of course not.
