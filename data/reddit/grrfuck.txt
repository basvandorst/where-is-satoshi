Just going through that now from the ground up - really want to know how this transaction was compromised, will post anything I find

Oh well - at the very least I've learned a lesson :) Thanks very much for your help on this
I'll assume this wallet has been compromised but would appreciate two factor for any transaction on the wallet - where is this feature you speak of? If I'm going to start fresh, may as well do it right :)

I primarily use blockchain.info but searching for the transaction on blockexplorer causes a timeout, bad timing for website difficulties heh.

I hope this is what you need:
sent to this wallet: 14pMSPQuWqejDBNuJGd4PiV4fdq7RPabTf

yeah a friend felt sorry for me and sent it
Have scanned my machine, all seems well, so have transferred to a newer safer wallet. Though there were a few login requests while I was away, so someone was trying to get in for that last 0.06.. will see if that stays where its meant to.

Thats what I was thinking and what I feared most, so have taken appropriate measures. New wallet appears safe right now, but even if it isnt I'm not going to lose sleep over 0.06BTC. Will leave it for now but will definitely read some of the more popular bitcoin security threads before buying any more. Thanks for your response!

Yeah I have two factor setup to send to my email, didnt get any confirmation there. Still sitting at only 1 confirmation.
Apologies again, noobfactor - what do you mean by the address? Of the transaction or something else?

I just had the wallet ID in a text file on an old drive I happened across while looking for something else and used one of my old passwords. Nope, nobody else has access to the account, PC is bug free, remaining BTC is in the new wallet, no access attempts. Though plenty of access attempts on the old wallet still heh
