This is a great point. If he doesn't patent it, someone else could and now the technology is on their terms.

I've pre ordered soylent because it is fast, healthy, and cheap. I think many people that have ordered would agree that they don't want to completely give up food. There are days where I may not have time to go grocery shopping and cook and so I order food. But, thats expensive and usually unhealthy, so this would be a great solution.

the bitcoin community is being naive when they dismiss the current system of chargebacks we currently have in place. the consumer is losing a little bit of power in this regard.  
there are mitigations tho. escrow service is one of those. It would work well for online sales.

I believe that if bitcoin gains adoption to the point where most of the world is using it as their currency then the price will be very high. If we lived in a world where bitcoin was the primary currency then the total value of all bitcoins would have to be enough to purchase everything. 
Imagine the scenario where all bitcoins in existence totaled up to $100 and everyone on the planet used them. In order to purchase a car you would have to have more bitcoins than there are in the world to purchase it. -- Which doesn't make sense. So if instead all the bitcoins in the world totaled 2 million dollars you would only need fractions of a bitcoin to purchase a car. Which seems more reasonable. But, if you wanted to purchase Google you'd have to pay more bitcoins than there are in existence. -- Which doesn't make sense. So the total value of all bitcoins must be high enough for people to purchase anything they want. 
That is probably not a very clear way of explaining it. But the short version is: I believe with more adoption of bitcoin the higher value bitcoin becomes. I believe the price will increase because I think bitcoin is superior to fiat currencies and it's only a matter of time until bitcoin overtakes fiat currency.

The Stock to Flow model may not be accurate beyond SF = 62 (gold). After the current havening the SF value will be 50 with a predicted value of $55k. Since gold has the highest SF value known we can't accurately predict what may happen when SF goes above that because there is no data for it. We can only try to predict up to that point. Beyond that point it could be that it begins to taper off and reaches a limit, we just don't know.

It means that Purse will hold the bitcoins during the transaction. There are two ways the trade can go:  
1. Transaction goes smoothly between buyer and seller and bitcoins get released by the buyer. 
2. There is a dispute from the buyer. Purse will then look at the evidence and either send the bitcoin back to the buyer or release them to the seller depending on what they decide is fair.

Can you explain this more? I can't figure out how this would protect the poker site from volatility.

I don't think doing instant buying/selling would work for DK or FD because of the limits coinbase/bitpay have on accounts. We would be talking millions of dollars every day.  
Edit: If I'm wrong about this please let me know.
