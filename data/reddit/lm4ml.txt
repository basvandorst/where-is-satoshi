I don't think C is the industry standard anymore unless you are super low level stuff. And if a language is popular, it will have compiler support for all of the platforms you need (really just linux and maybe windows).
If you know C, you can learn something like Go very quickly, so I don't think it is that much of an advantage for every programmer to know it. I would argue that it is far easier for most programmers to write effectively in something more modern than in C, since there are so many pitfalls and undefined behaviour that comes with the language. Just because you know the language, doesn't mean you can write it safely.

How does Bitcoin have fundamental value? Scarcity does not imply value.

Why is that a lame argument? Everyone on Reddit was complaining about censorship when they thought that the admins had taken down that post about Russian intervention on r/thedonald, so clearly it is a pretty common opinion that the government is not the only organisation capable of censorship.

I don't think the competence of the userbase has anything to do with how secure an OS is. Although you are probably right in that for people targeting personal machines, they are more likely to go after windows. Linux is definitely a huge target though because if you can hack into a Linux server, you can take over basically every website in the world, so the benefits of an exploit are greater.

If you don't like the fees you can always use debit, the fees are pretty minimal.

What is the reasoning behind implementing this using C? There are lots of more modern, low-level languages (ex. Rust) that provide more safety and less footguns.
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:46:51
How is Windows less secure than Linux? For the average user I would imagine it is the other way around, since there is a greater incentive to get the ability to hack into Linux machines, since most companies are based on Linux, and Windows is targeted towards people who probably don't know how to configure an antivirus properly.

The energy consumption increases when the mining reward increases, which happens whenever the price or usage of Bitcoin increases. More mining reward makes mining more profitable, so more miners enter the market and start using electricity.
@_date: 2018-09-24 03:34:09
The only reason Bitcoin transactions are larger is because it is very rarely used for buying things people actually need on a daily basis. Transaction volume is extremely relevant and comparable, because if Bitcoin actually became mainstream, it would need to support the same number of transactions that VISA does, and that 37x figure would drop. I'm sure VISA can handle $3000 payments just as well as it can handle $1 payments, the size of the transaction is actually the least relevant thing when looking at scalability.
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:03:31
If the network increases in size, we will need more security to avoid a 50% attack becoming profitable, so mining will also have to increase.
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:57:09
If Bitcoin looses value, this loop goes in reverse! Bitcoin becomes less valuable -&gt; less people compete to earn Bitcoin -&gt; Bitcoin is less secure -&gt; Bitcoin becomes less valuable...

Really? I've always been able to pay with both. The bank card is just a regular visa debit card most of the time, works with the machines.
@_date: 2018-10-17 16:35:21
In many decades that will be true, however currently the price is increasing far faster than the mining reward is decreasing. And at some point transaction fees will replace the mining reward, so there can still be a high incentive to mine. The money spent on mining must be greater than the reward for doing a 51% attack against Bitcoin, so the more it is used the more mining is required just for security.
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:35:09
You cant directly compare the energy usage since Bitcoin is used far less than the current banking system. And the response to this is always "bitcoins energy usage isn't dependent on usage", which is false because the greater the usage, the greater the reward for a 50% attack, which means you need to spend more on electricity to secure the network, since you need to spend enough so that a 50% attack isn't worth the cost.
@_date: 2018-10-19 15:49:15
What about the article was false? They were just summarizing an economists report.
@_date: 2018-10-01 19:37:30
Not sure what your point is. The same thing can happen with Bitcoin (or anything else you buy with a loan). The difference is with a house, if the price crashes you still have somewhere to live. If you take out a loan to buy Bitcoin and it goes to 0, you have nothing.

A day trader dealing only with crypto will be less involved than someone handling many types of assets, since they are trading less things and have fewer relevant graphs.

Look at the graph of the CO2 levels over the last 40,000 years. Notice how it goes pretty much vertical once it reaches the 1900's? So unless you think NASA is lying about their data, it is obvious that humans caused this increase - how else do you explain the fastest increase in CO2 levels ever recorded coinciding with the population explosion and industrialization of humans?

Juniper Research? The entire article was just saying "Juniper Research said...". Can it really be called a biased hit piece for just quoting a research paper? And the video at the top of the article is pro-bitcoin.

Yea, mortgages would definitely exist if the fed didn't print money, but that wasn't the question.

A 401k is probably the easiest way for the average person to become a millionaire, and have a good retirement. If you have more invested in Bitcoin than in your 401k, and have a significant amount of money, I think it is a questionable decision - don't gamble with your retirement.

Even through the Visa network, debit cards have far lower fees (less than 1%, afaik)

He is actually correct. Although it was 400 million years ago, so I'm not sure what his point is.

Sure, if they bought a place to live that they would actually use. It doesn't matter what your house price is if you are actually living in it, you still have a place to live for the rest of your life. Sounds pretty secure to me so long as you buy something you can afford.
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:59:38
Sounds like whataboutism. You can't just dismiss waste in one industry because there is waste in another industry. That logic can be used to justify pretty much any usage of energy.
@_date: 2018-10-15 21:05:35
I think it is pretty irrelevant how much the fees are for huge transactions. If I am transferring millions of dollars, I don't care if the fee is $1, or $1000, either way it is a tiny percentage of what I am moving around. I think it is actually one of the worst use-cases for Bitcoin - if you are moving that much money around, you want to pay more in order to have some security and protection around your money, to guard against things like accidentally sending to the wrong address or something.
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:03:16


However if the price of Bitcoin doubles, the mining reward roughly doubles, so there can be twice as many miners while still being profitable.

You only lose it to the bank if you are an idiot and buy things you can't afford, or you choose to lose it because you think it is a better deal to just abandon the house. The value of the house does not affect your monthly payment, or ownership of it.

You can't just take the start and end date, and say that since the price was the same, there is no volatility... If a stock fluctuates by 20% every, but ends the month at the same price, would you consider that stable? Probably not.

The core argument of the post seems to be that, if you didn't spend money on Bitcoin, you would spend money on something else that uses energy. I don't think that is really a valid argument at all. First of all for me, at least, the alternative to buying Bitcoin is putting money in investments. Secondly, the article doesn't actually compare how much energy Bitcoin uses when compared to other things people buy, which is pretty critical to the argument that it saves energy.
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:35:50
Sure, but that is still not as safe as doing a regular bank transaction, where you can reverse it if you do something wrong. If I send 1 million through a bank, I'm not going to worry because I know if I make a mistake I have someone to talk to about it. With Bitcoin, mistakes are irreversible. No matter how many precautions I take, I would still be more worried with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:20:52
What does that have to do with inflation? Inflation affects both house prices and salaries, it wouldn't change the ratio between the two.
@_date: 2018-10-30 13:50:15
OK you have to be a troll. Time frame is obviously relevant, since we are talking about the rate of increase, not absolute levels of CO2, that are causing the issue. Not sure how you came to the conclusion that CO2 doesn't have anything to do with climate change, it is a greenhouse gas, obviously increased levels will lead to an increase in temperature.
@_date: 2018-10-30 13:39:42
That was over 400 million years ago... As I said, the issue isn't the increase, the issue is the rate at which it is happening. Do you think that every scientist is lying? Is it all a big conspiracy? I honestly don't know how you can even disagree with the fact that humans are significantly contributing to climate change.
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:50:01
You don't think most mainstream economists think Bitcoin is going to go down? To me it seems like most economists are predicting it will go down more, especially considering the number of daily transactions still seems to be going down.

Who uses Transferwise to send $1 million? It is mainly used for converting into a different currency while doing bank transfers, so the comparison doesn't even make sense. You can't just say that, because Transferwise, a currency conversion service, costs $7,500 in fees, every other banking transfer will cost that much.
Wiring money is a flat fee (less than $50), which can be waived in lots of cases, why wouldn't the article compare with that? You honestly think people with $1 million being sent around are spending $7k on fees every time?
@_date: 2018-10-26 13:10:46


Isn't it the other way around? The rich have more money, so they have to worry about inflation, while the poor don't have much money saved so inflation doesn't hurt them? Anyone can avoid inflation through investments (lots of savings accounts that give 2% if you are risk adverse), not sure how it is different for rich vs poor.
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:43:15
Or they will just use their debit card instead of credit card.
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:24:26
How is Bitcoins inflation schedule fixed? It's price fluctuates significantly. We generally use the term "inflation" to indicate how much the value of a currency changes. With Bitcoin that is far more unpredictable than with the USD.
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:32:49
The issue is that the climate is changing much more quickly than before, so the environment cannot adapt to the new situation. It is caused by humans, and is a big issue, it's absurd that there are still people out there who don't believe this. It's not complicated.
@_date: 2018-10-27 13:11:00
No true Scotsman is a logical fallacy. You could make the same argument about fiat, saying that the USD is the only legitimate currency
@_date: 2018-10-27 13:12:56
The title is a lie. The average time as a reserve currency for fiat is 27 years. That is completely different than saying the average life span of fiat currency is 27 years. The USD could stop being a reserve currency, and still be worth just as much, and be just as useful for day to day transactions.
@_date: 2018-10-24 12:50:39
But that's for people trading tonnes of different stocks and assets. Much different than someone just trading crypto.
@_date: 2018-10-19 19:13:21
Yea I agree with you, I think that fees are completely insignificant when you are moving millions around. Who cares about a $500 fee when you are moving millions. But the article's assertion that it must cost thousands because that's how much Transferwise costs makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:02:12
Bitcoin is also barely used, so on a per-transaction level it uses far more energy, like orders of magnitude more. And when you scale it up, energy usage will increase, because the price will necessarily increase, causing the mining reward to go up, allowing more miners to enter. Every 10 minutes, 12.5 Bitcoin are generated - if the value of those Bitcoin doubles, the amount of miners the network can support will also double.
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:30:36
You don't believe in human caused climate change? It's a pretty well known scientific fact...

There is a lot of inherent costs that come with a house - building houses isn't cheap, and neither is property. Without mortgages, rich people would own all the houses, and everyone else would just rent from them. Sure, prices would go down, but they still would be expensive, and people would stop building them because they aren't worth enough.
@_date: 2018-10-01 18:55:29
Owing more on something that it is worth is completely different than going to 0. By your logic, Bitcoin can also go to less than 0 if you take a loan out to get it.
@_date: 2018-11-03 18:23:01
But with shared hosting there are companies spending millions to ensure it is secure, even with those virtualization layers. If someone found a way to break through, there would be vulnerabilities in tonnes of major websites, so there is a huge incentive to keep it secure. If you are running your own server, you are fully responsible for your security, which I think is a lot more risky.
@_date: 2018-11-03 18:16:09
I mean I would imagine that would be significantly more insecure, definitely more insecure than AWS or Azure, so it doesn't really make sense if you are worried about security.

You could trade stocks on a blockchain, and then it would be the same as Bitcoin as far as free speech goes.
@_date: 2018-11-03 15:40:27
I think you can generally trust AWS and Azure though. Tonnes of huge tech companies trust them enough to run their servers in the cloud, I think it is safe enough for a Bitcoin node.
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:22:09
Sure, but why would you trust your own servers over ones managed by AWS or Azure? I doubt the average person updates their server often enough to have the latest security patches, there's probably a higher risk of your personal server being hacked due to a bad config than Amazon or Microsoft singling out your server to hijack in some way.
