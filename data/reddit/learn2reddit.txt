I don't use LinkedIn often so honest question: have you had good interactions with people because of LinkedIn? People I know that use it just complain about how much recruit spam they get. They are humble bragging but it does make me wonder if people make friends and get jobs from LinkedIn connections

I don't mean to be harsh, but this type of thinking is why companies cover up their mistakes and cause so much pain. Owning the fact that bugs exist is great and mature. Lying and keeping a facade that everything is 100% safe is unhealthy. Exchanges can lose your funds (despite their guarantees). Your bank could lose your funds. Any system (electronic or not) means it is possible to have bugs or errors.

It just drives home how little people know about it--meaning we have lots more potential adoption to come. These people don't have intelligent criticisms about deflationary currencies or protocol limitations. These are like the people who said preposterous, unfounded criticisms of the internet when it was first developing, and now everyone accepts the internet, whether they know how it works or not.
    
My point is that once I stop seeing "Who cares? Still a scam. Still garbage." and "Things are so bad, even the inventor of Bitcoin has disassociated himself from it" as comments on the articles, then I will change my position from "extremely bullish." That would mean that bitcoin is being taken seriously by the general public and has been priced in as such.
@_date: 2014-07-13 22:09:58
The reason people don't try to help you is because there is almost always no chance of recovery. There's a reason people use cash and bitcoins to buy illegal goods: it can't be used to track you down. Regarding community apathy, it's not so much that people are heartless or don't care about others, but rather we've seen it a lot and know that there is nothing you can do. Therefore, focus on teaching people why and how their coins were stolen and how it can be prevented in the future.

I don't think he meant offense. The author is supposed to make a decision to use he or she for a singular pronoun. In this specific situation, "they" might be appropriate because Satoshi may have been more than one person. It is not good style to write "he/she/it/they," and many people default to "he," especially males.
@_date: 2013-06-28 22:20:24
Generally, I would refer you to the wiki, but it appears to be down. Many people have put great thought into nice beginner descriptions on there. Since you've said you are already interested in using Bitcions, this popular video might be more basic than what you are looking for. Feel free to ask more specific questions.

edit: Anyone can feel free to work from this or ignore it because it's terrible. I realised that I shouldn't be chopping the first digit because we knows it's 9 digits long. I'm out for now.
I think this is the answer recursively, but it overflows the stack... Anyway I used this forum post as a starting point and just tweaked it. Put the part you are sure you know in the knownpart variable (if it's not actually what you said it was). The passphrase part should be good to go if it is just 9 zeros or ones.
     -w
    $knownpart = "happyday"
    passphrase = "010101010"
    $characters = "01"
    def test(phrase)
      print phrase, "\t"
      system("./bitcoind", "walletpassphrase", $knownpart + phrase, "20")
      case $?.exitstatus
      when 0
        puts "Found the number combo!  
        exit 0
      when 127
        puts "bitcoind not found in current dir"
        exit 1
      end
    end
    def permu(currpass)
      currpass.length.times do |i|
        $characters.chars.each do |c|
          testphrase = currpass.dup
          testphrase[i] = c
          test testphrase
          nextpass = testphrase[1..-1]
          permu( nextpass)
        end
      end
    end
    permu( passphrase)
    puts "No luck."
    exit 1

There are 2 basic ways of obtaining Bitcoins. 1: Mining them. 2: Buying them. I would only suggest mining them if you have an AMD GPU. To buy them, you can use one of the online exchanges, with Mt. Gox being the most popular. Another option is to buy them in person at  I have no experience with this, but it is doable.

How does a site like this gain user's trust? That's a lot of "lawless" money to be held in escrow. I see that you have gotten some interviews with legitimate sites and use your real name so is that my answer?

tl;dr What other people have done is completely irrelivant.
Any speculative investor knows not to invest something they can't afford to lose. That is a risky move. Better hope that you have a secure job, but even then, you never know. We all want to see Bitcoin suceed, but most everyone understands its volatility and risk.

I think he's right. That is exactly what it looks like to people who have never heard of Bitcoin or who have only heard bad things.

My first question is, "Is this necessary right now?" Are people brute forcing the bitcoin-qt and popular online wallet keys? Anyway, anyone who understands your current product description in its entirety probably has a good handle on keeping their private key safe. Unless you are ok with appealing only to those ready to take extra steps to ensure security, this should be pretty cheap. I know I didn't pay $70 for my leather wallet! Sure I think you will make some money from this from the crypto enthusiasts, but if you want this to be the de-facto way of obtaining a wallet, make it cheap! Look how hard it is to get some people to enable 2 factor... Also, maybe stick to laymen's terms for the main description and have another paragraph for the details.
Great product, just trying to be as critical as possible. Glad to see Bitcoin products.

I suppose this contributes nothing to the discussion, but OP is 14 years old? That's 8th grade. Not buying that. His grammar is way too good to be in middle school. Look at his other posts; he has been on reddit for a year and posts stuff that most 7th or 8th graders won't touch for a while. He shoots quality photos. What middle schooler does that? His redeeming posts are his runescape question and showing his school lesson on polynomials. Now I'm confused. Anyway, so assume you are indeed a 14 year old miner. Good for you. You managed to find 8 other kids that are doing this too?! Most teens and adults are not into this.

I don't want to link my bank account to any exchange and there are no localbitcoin dealers in my area, nor is there a Chase bank to deposit cash to mtgox. But I love the concepts behind the currency and like contributing knowledge to newcomers when I can and scraping up promo bitcents.

So I'm curious; do you feel guilty doing that?
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:45:58
Why can't you use coinbase to get BTC with your bank account then transfer that btc to btc-e and trade to your heart's content with whatever currency you want?
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:00:01
Cryptoshi. Add in whatever modifiers (Universal, Decentralized, Bank, whatever stuff other people have said). Doesn't limit you to Bitcoin, but sneaks in the original implementer of crypto currency.

I'm buying Bitcoins. This would be useful for the seller haha
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:27:06
I have been doing this for 15 or so minutes now and it is not working. The email seemed to take a while too so I imagine your servers might be a bit bogged for some reason

1. Go to the nearest fountain and get 70 cents. 
2. Deposit in linked bank account. 
3. ???? 
4. Profit

Isn't bitstamp wire transfers only for US residents?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:09:13
That is exactly what I was thinking
@_date: 2013-10-17 05:08:38
Many supporters of Bitcoin who wouldn't normally buy your game, would buy it to support Bitcoin and make you another proponent of it. So yes, I think offering it as an option really doesn't hurt. Additionally, you don't have a credit card company taking &gt;2.5% of the transaction if you use Bitcoin.
As others have said, you can ignore the Bitcoin price by using some of those services and getting USD immediately.

People don't read much anymore...
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:39:56
they changed it to 20 cents with the recent price spike
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:54:10
Are tips sent through this not public? I always thought that was the best part because of all the people that see it and comment
@_date: 2013-07-16 01:30:41
Dang downvoted... I guess there wasn't room for sarcasm in the fierce competition for the 1 BTC
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:17:50
Is the risk here getting robbed?
@_date: 2013-09-12 06:39:14
I believe pikapay is a similar service, fyi
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:25:00
Maybe. But you know what I meant. He knew enough to make a unicorn joke. He has to at least know that it can be exchanged for cash, yet still was immature about it
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:38:10
What's your project?
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:40:10
Exactly. It's considered a necessity for many. "Why use bitcoin when my bank already has something better?!?!"
@_date: 2013-07-05 03:47:01
Ah thanks. I didn't know that was an option! Ok, maybe my message should have been more like Jack_Perth's. But by "being mean" here I hope to have saved many other people from scammers by discouraging PayPal trading.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:04:21
Cool idea! But make sure the proof is good!
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:32:22
I think you underestimate the power of a centralized, government backed bank over the minds of American people
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:01:55
Exactly what I wanted. Thanks!

Localbitcoins.com is pretty straightforward. Only deal with people who have escrow enabled. You typically pay a bit more for the anonymity and convenience if it all though
@_date: 2013-10-05 03:01:16
Hahaha now that is actually funny. Additionally, if they end up pulling all those funds out, the fees will cost more than the coins are worth
@_date: 2013-07-16 03:05:49
Looks interesting. Definitely post on here when it launches, but those features better be pretty darn good for us to put our coins in your hands.
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:26:48
@_date: 2013-11-01 04:04:21
You're right coinbase is definitely better. But the escrow on localbitcoins is hosted by the site itself. If you trust localbitcoins.com, then you trust users with escrow
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:08:42
Wow how did this happen? A wrote that price in and let it sit on the order book? And was that the only sell order at some point?
@_date: 2013-05-05 08:22:18
Chrome's advanced settings has a setting that requires you to click on a plugin for it to run. You can whitelist sites. It also allows disabling javascript. Looks like NoScript has more features though.

I also found that picture and caption humorous. Looks like this thread is too heated for jokes
