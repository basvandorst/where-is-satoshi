Just imagine the money market admins of marketplaces that exit scammed. I believe evolution market place still has all the coins in its wallet still.

Is the 122 years legit? Or is that a far fetched number you picked out of thin air. Just so newcomers don’t start spouting misinformation.

It’s amazing what normal every day people do with a little bit of extra $$$. Makes you think how bullshit “trickle down” economics is.

You’ve got at least 6 decent sized market exit scams with “lost bitcoin” over the last 4 years. Evolution being one of the bigger markets to run off with bitcoin. If you go digging you’ll find that wallet still sitting with coin.

Watch it. Season one looks like shit quality, that’s the point though. It gets better every season. Don’t watch the Europe or USA tour until you’ve seen a few seasons of the regular show.

That’s unfortunate to hear. I like them for what they offer. Never had to deal with customer service though.

Have you not bugged them? People make mistakes. Sitting and waiting doesn’t always work out.

The internet is only a dozen or so servers hidden around the world is it not? I recall in the late 90s 8-9 servers were attacked and the Internet was slowed WAY down for a period of time.
