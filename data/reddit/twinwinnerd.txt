Hey Trignos_,
CEO of BitPanda/Coinimal here, nothing much changed. We rebranded and added a Bitcoin wallet for our users. The PayPal service works exactly the same as before.

It is a group vault and we have all three keys. But the recovery tool doesn't work with the group vaults (it is in the readme file too)

Hello Bitcoin_forever,
we are referring to the purchase of Bitcoin with Credit cards.
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:40:39
None of the sites you posted offer a cheaper way to buy Bitcoin with credit cards in Europe. If you know a site that does, please let me know. Thank you

As much as I'd like to agree on this, there is a big difference between increase in monetary base and inflation.

In what area do you think will be the next big Bitcoin application?  
- Finance  
- Payments  
- Remittence  
- Digital Ownership  
- Something else?

I dont think they still have it, but they found a loop as they never offered USD -&gt; crypto

We charge the standard Skrill merchant fees of 0.4€+3.4%. So it is a bit cheaper than the Neteller fees we have to charge.

Maybe he was just sending BTC to different addresses and instead of one big TX he used chained transactions. There is no reason why he shouldnt do what he did to send BTC

Most people import the bip38 key into blockchain.info which is in the end much less secure as trezor for usage. Storage is more secure yes. 
You could also use a password with your seed on trezor

Mining is nowhere near as proifitable as you think. The TX fees are only around 0.25-0.5 BTC per block (might be even lower).

We will start to offer that in a few days most likely.

The human mind is very easily fooled. It always searches for and most often finds trends and patterns at data it looks at. Even if that data is completely random or only fundamentially influenced.
I once had a very ibteresting dicussion with a technical analyist trader that argued he can profitable trade random walks (the ones that can go infinitely high or low and zero bias).
So no wonder people like op will draw fancy lines and expect 'sell outs'. Amazing
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:18:30
In what way? Whats the advantage over other systems?
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:49:37
Yes, for eWallets purchases verification is always needed. Also the minimum order volume is 25€ but you get a 5€ voucher for your first order so more like 20€

There is no other official option to exchange Skrill to Bitcoin. If someone offers this, he is breaking the TOS of Skrill and his and your Skrill account might be banned.  
We are the first and only merchant to offer this and its not possible to offer lower fees if an official merchant account is used for this.
@_date: 2015-12-13 20:51:33


We don't know yet if we will seize your coins or not. hmm
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:36:37
That is the payment provider fee. If they offered Skrill they would have to charge 3.4% ontop too. 
Feel free to use bank transfer like on Coinbase, its free here.

Hello!  
I was thinking  about how does this prevent Sybil attacks? As I understand if you have a treshhold of the bits you can unencrypted everything
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:17:17
Surely a big improvement to their current mt4 solution. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:35:35
My line of thinking would be the following:  
We start with the assumption that the current price is an equilibrium of 864000 mining sells and 864000 influx of new funds.   
Now with the new additional influx of 1.4M $ each day, the selling pressure from mining needs to equal the 1400000+864000 buying power, thus the price needs to rise to 628$ to reach an equilibrium.

Front running is only a problem if you do a market order deeper than level 1. This means that if you put in the orders systematically clearing the orderbook order by order (not in the same block) then there is no possible way he can frontrun you.   
This means a concerned trader can just make a series of trades instead of one to 100% prevent this issue.

Micro-economical speaking: Everyone that can has marginal costs below the value of what they earn, will expand. This will last until the firm/person can no longer profitable expand.  
Everyone will do this, thus leading to a market where in the end only the most cost-efficent miners will be able to stay in the market and have all the market shares. 
So, per definition, in the long run, mining can only be "profitable" (profitable being the act of buying and running mining software, not just running already bought hardware) for very cost efficent miners that make use of scale-effects and cheap electricity!
@_date: 2014-12-31 19:46:41
Mining "Bitcoin".

It usually is removed within 48 hours if noone picks up the transaction into a block. I have used that feature, and i have never had any problems so far! They transactions take a bit longer to confirm because they are quite bit, but time will sort out everything!
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:09:55
Thank you :)  
Indeed, the more volume we will get, the more competitive our prices will be.  
But litebit.eu is actually slightly more expensive, because they add the fees of the payment provider on top! So for SOFORT Transfer, we got them beat.

Backstory: A hacker entered a BTER.com server and realized the used the same password for 90% of all their services and logins. Also they used their password for the NXT account with 50 M NXT in it (1.8 M USD).  
**BTER asked NXT community to hard fork their Blockchain to return funds. The community decided against that.**
Now BTER has made a deal with the hacker and he returned all funds to make them solvent again.

@_date: 2014-03-25 19:45:42
A bitcoin address does actually not correspond to a public key. The public key will only be created at the first transaction. The reason for this is, that multiple (10^X )private keys correspond to a single address. So each private key of that address will generate a different public key.
Quite intresting if you think about it :)

What I meant was that ALL Fiat is inflationairy and the monetary basis is exponentially increased. Sure some Fiat will do better than others, but eventually all Fiat will devaluate compared to BTC, even if BTC doesn't gain in purchasing power.

@_date: 2014-03-28 01:00:45
There is a way to prevent that. You can send the raw transaction to the POS terminal. This terminal now broadcasts the transaction and validates it. If it doesn't get processed within some time, the POS terminal just keeps broadcasting it. If it is broadcasted often enough, it will be kept in the memory pool!

That is utter bullshit you are talking. You said "on exchangeS" so I assume you would spread them on to all USD exchanges proportionally to the order book they have. You would in NO way come close to that 200 number.  
Also that would be plain retarded to do that and not sell in chunks.

I missread your OP and though that address was yours, and the hacker transfered 16 coins.

I appologize!
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:41:32
No, i have already bet on that site. Just think about it in an example. If you now want to bet 1000 BTC on "No" than you can't get 1:250 . that would be ridiculous,where would the funds come from?   
The changing odds make sence, because it rewards early bettors, because their bets get a higher weight

Bitcoin did the same thing with a hard fork (well, then it was no hack).  
Other than that, I don't find it "against" the rules of decentralisation and the blockchain. &gt;50% of all forgers have to agree to use the new version. The core devs release 2 versions, one that fixes it, one that keeps everything intact. People need to decide. That is the spirit!  
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:23:36
Yes, thats why every fee below 0.0001 was equal to zero. 
That's what i wrote ;)

Not true at all. MGWu was opensourced and anyone can setup a cluster. Or are you referring that you will not be promoted if the developers don't think you are trustworthy?

Everything below 0.0001 BTC as fee is considered NO FEE. So either send no fee of 0.0001. It is standard for your transaction not to be picked up for several hours if you send without fee. So there is that.

What most people don't realize is, that once you have 51% of the network, you can mine every single block. Just do it in secret and publish the longest chain only consisting of your blocks once you have it again. So a miner doesn't need to steal with double spending, he can just collect the 2million USD in new created coins a day ;)
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:39:06
you can make unlimited transactions (well nearly) per block. You don't need to wait for a confirmation.

Hello Marrimm,
you need to open an account and verify it to be able to buy Bitcoin with OKPay. Once you have done that you can buy upto 5000€ worth of Bitcoin per day. Currently only European customers can buy Bitcoin at Coinimal.

Please feel free to write to Amazon to confirm this. We are an Austrian GmbH that has operated for over a year and has innovative partners like Skrill, Neteller and PayPal and a very good standing in the community. Not sure where you got the feeling that something is wrong.
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:51:33

It depends on the definition of commercial trade in the country you operate. If you make a continuous profit with the trade (even if its at 0%) then it would still be commercial. 
if you just make some small trades from time to time, you should be safe anyway.
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:52:49
Because they ran out of coins and its cheaper to buy from customers that refill on exchanges.
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:35:16
And then you get busted for commercial Bitcoin trading because you intended to make a profit and get busted for money launderkng because you never heard of AML and KYC

Purse.io is a neat service, but many people are not comfortable using wishlists to buy goods. Especially with warranty and other issues, they prefer to use their personal account. This method helps doing that.

Oh my! you are right. I am sorry for this, just fixed it. Wrong setting. I will send you a 5€ Amazon.de voucher to your email address to compensate!
@_date: 2016-01-04 18:28:03
You go to our site and sell Bitcoins for Amazon.de vouchers. It is a very easy process.
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:01:23
Gyft.com doesn't have Amazon.de vouchers in their portfolio.
@_date: 2016-01-02 00:33:35
That doesnt make sense. If their success is soley depending on price they should just buy BTC instead. I am quite sure every big miner is doing it profitably already

It was possible in the US, but this is the first method to officialy buy vouchers of Amazon.de
@_date: 2016-01-04 18:27:29
It is the same company but a different market. It is for the german Amazon marketplace
@_date: 2016-01-04 19:36:49
I am sorry but I never wrote that Amazon is taking Bitcoin. Why would our service be neccessary then?
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:49:16
We had to convince their compliance departmant that there is no risk of negative impact for them. Took a few months ;)
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:09:36
Yes, we have a direct merchant contract with Amazon. They checked this use case and we are currently the only company that can officially sell amazon.de vouchers from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-29 14:03:04

I can't comment on this case in specific, but Skrill (former Moneybookers) is very big in the eWallet business and combined with Neteller and PaySafeCard they form the PaySafe Group. Also they are listed on the stock exchange (2bn valuation)

It is infact an Amazon voucher code that you receive (as we write in the news article). The good thing is that you can now buy those vouchers with Bitcoins instantly without any fees, that was previously not possible.
@_date: 2016-01-07 02:54:24
There was no actual 1000BTC bet. The owner of the site placed it and the later bet against himself

We have direct contracts with them, how else would you call that?  
Also we have a direct implementation of their API, so we are no standard voucher (10€, 20€, 50€ ect) resellers either.

Please read that I wrote amazon.DE. As in Amazon germany. Non of those sites have vouchers for that site.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:56:53
Skrill itself has internal limits, if you need higher limits you will probably have to verify yourself.

I also don't understand the point he is trying to make. Customers can buy Amazon.de vouchers with Bitcoin.

If you shop at Amazon.de you can use this also from Switzerland already.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:30:31
Never liked the term Bits myself, but you have a point. Until now I was using mBTC, Satoshis and BTC. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:21:10
We are directly connected to their API and can create vouchers of any denomination on demand. Pretty cool!
@_date: 2016-01-23 18:50:27

What do you mean? You can use your own Bitcoins for this, just click on "Sell" and you will be shown a Bitcoin address to pay for the Amazon.de voucher.  
Maybe I am missunderstanding though.

why would it stop in may?

Skype is completely unsecure. Their Skype might be compromissed itself
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:01:28
That cant be. Our minimum sell is 25€ so that number makes no sense. You can buy and sell upto 5000€ a day
@_date: 2016-01-04 18:34:54
No! After you buy the voucher, we have no further information from it.
@_date: 2016-01-04 22:30:38
Sorry office typing from cellphone
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:15:36
You are right, we will think how to display this prominently. Thank you :)
@_date: 2016-01-04 23:55:56
This service is nothing like Purse. There is no chance of legal fees or anything because we sell amazon vouchers that we get directly via authorized amazon.de API.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:09:17
@_date: 2016-01-05 01:28:17
For unverified accounts its 1000€ per day with a 10k total. For higher linits you need to verify the account
@_date: 2016-01-30 00:11:14
Hmm, lets hope they find a block soon then.
@_date: 2016-01-04 19:09:56
There is a negative fee on Amazon.de vouchers, so you have the baseprice which is 2% lower but you get extra 2%, so in the end you get exactly the market rate. Please check again :)
@_date: 2016-01-04 14:46:04
We are very stoked about this service too! For the past months we worked closely with the Amazon team (they are great people btw!) to offer this. More regions to follow soon.
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:09:15
Please feel free to write to Amazon to confirm this. We are an Austrian GmbH that has operated for over a year and has innovative partners like Skrill, Neteller and PayPal and a very good standing in the community. Not sure where you got the feeling that something is wrong.

We already sorted it out. OP made a mistake and forgot that he bought BTC a few days ago. All good :)

Currently we offer buying with credit card for the UK market but it's priced in EUR, so there is the FX on top, it's still very competitively priced compared to all UK services. We will add new currencies in the future, then this will be much cheaper for you guys!

It's still funded from Mike and he reported the numbers afaik.

I always thought they were included in those numbers?

If you pay with SEPA deposit and withdrawal the spread is around 100€ right now. This is subject to current market conditions and is being reduced over time.
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:35:07
Do you mean the inflation that the miners get? Because the users are already paying that. But you can't pinpoint it down to the transactions costing that much. It is more a cost of holding Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2016-11-30 20:03:53
Are you that clueless? Please research why empty blocks are a thing....

This service seems extremely expensive (3.9% + Fees) and delivers the coins with one day delay?
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:20:38
this is Paul, CEO of Coinimal.com. I don't know exactly what you are saying because you can't "deduct" money from an account with a SEPA payment. Please PM me your emailaddress, then I can look into this. But be assured, 100% there was no deduction on your bank account  from us!
EDIT: Just found out what happend.... OP you BOUGHT bitcoins 4 days ago using our service... that is the payment you are seeing and you made the payment.
@_date: 2016-12-24 22:17:18
You can sell Bitcoin for Neteller on 
It is an official deal with them, so you dont have to make shady deals on localbitcoins
@_date: 2016-11-07 12:29:11
So in both cases stocks could drop, but markets don't have this priced in?  
Sounds legit
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:28:54

Hey! Co-founder of BitPanda.com here.
We charge currently 1% for SEPA withdrawals!
@_date: 2016-11-20 15:29:59
This is just false. At 5% network hashing power you are expected to find 7.2 blocks per 24 hours. If you only find 3-4 due to luck, then yes, your hashing power just mysteriously reduced by half in your metric.
Same with bitcoin.com, it's now up from 0.6% to 3.4%.... 
variance is a thing

Remember though, ETFs are using swaps to some degree to mimic the underlying asset as good as possible. Not sure if the Bitcoin ETFs will do that too, but nearly all Index ETFs do it because it is cheaper than tracking the real composition all the time, due to fluctuations.

How was this calculated? That number seems wrong.

Sorry, but I call bullshit on many of those data.

Indeed, but you can use  to sell BTC for Neteller funds.
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:27:17
If you want to deposit with Bitcoin on Neteller and don't want to pay the 5% fee, you can use  to sell Bitcoins and receive € on Neteller with only 2.5% fee (and the funds are unrestricted, so they can be used for NET+ card).   
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:01:02
Indeed, but you can use  to sell BTC for Neteller funds.
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:28:22
You can use  to deposit to Neteller with much lower fees.
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:35:20
Oh, yes you are right. Its significantly more expensive to deposit to Stars with BTC now.  
PS: If you have a NETELLER € account you can use  to fund your account and only pay 2.5%
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:13:14
Are you saying users can't buy bitcoin on two days? Will you not get the 75$ if the user buys the BTC on 2 days?

All of the above.
@_date: 2015-11-09 11:35:10
Now the question is how much the day proce of it is. Also what limitations there are on drain
@_date: 2015-11-09 11:45:37
That is actually a bad thing rather than good. Most shopping networks are paid in CC or with payment on delivery. There would be so much chargeback, if physical delivery cant be proven.  
A physical deliverance of a paperwallet would work though.
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:28:24
You can use  to deposit to Neteller with much lower fees.
@_date: 2016-10-21 14:19:48
Doesn't matter the company either. There is no real decentralised altcoin exchange yet that is reliable. So 8billion USD worth of BTC need to be swapped using altcoin exchange companies. Hardly the most elegant solution.
@_date: 2015-11-13 01:41:16
And how are they gonna use it? The exhange to local fiat or mpesa will cost a fx spread
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:26:14
True! We will continue to add more Bitcoin stuff in the future. So many good memes to choose from. Rollercoaster guy is missing too
@_date: 2015-11-01 02:32:27
So this thread that is about Coinimal, and I am not to assume that the guy is talking about buying BTC with Coinimal?
@_date: 2015-11-11 11:32:38
That is cool then!
@_date: 2015-11-01 01:01:57
At Coinimal? I would take that bet ;)
@_date: 2015-11-09 13:37:14
The pysical bitcoins are a hit online, I am sure they could be marketed on TV too. No need for fidling around with paperwallets then.
@_date: 2015-11-11 17:40:56
Clickbait title. Thats like saying: "Startup XY could be worth 10bn or 0$ in the future".

Fixed the issue. Sorry for the hassle.
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:22:21
That's pretty cool and a neat idea!
@_date: 2015-11-09 12:15:02
There are solutions like a BIP38 (?) password protected private key. But you mostly just have to trust the issuing party.  
I agree that cool vanity wallets might sell well. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 22:23:30
As the owner of the instant Bitcoin exchange  I am looking forward to this. Sepa is very slow still and we currently have to rely on 3rd party providers like sofortüberweisung. 
That developement will make Sofort and co. irrelevant, looking forward on how theyll adapt
@_date: 2015-11-24 20:49:03
How many unique users though?
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:19:01
Those companies need to be 100% sure that the customers will not be scamed. As Coinimal is an Austrian GmbH that is fully compliant with all regulations, this makes our partners very confindent that we will be able to provide a stellar service.  
I imagine the other services were not up to this level of compliance and thus PayPal thought that they need to intervene. Or maybe they never even asked for permission. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 21:07:19
If those accounts are just not able to receive any funds, then I don't think that they can receive funds through Coinimal too.
@_date: 2015-11-13 15:07:25
Its amazing what price point a news article uses depending on if it wants to make a positive or negative spin
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:14:38
Coinmama is extremely expensive. You can instantly buy Bitcoin from  for a much lower fee and instantly move them to your electrum wallet.
@_date: 2015-11-17 21:31:01
Go to their homepage for example
@_date: 2015-11-25 12:16:31
I work very close with neteller and Skrill and can nearly with 100% certainty say, that they dont have a merchant account and are using a private account which is against the TOS.
If they are violating that already.....
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:56:35
I am sure if the price turned the other way you would have declined a refund. 
As a CEO of a bitcoin retailer myself, I find this outrageous
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:25:58
Coinimal.com is offering 5€ for new customers. So basically 15 times as much :)
@_date: 2016-10-21 14:08:29
So you are saying we rather should give a company (doesn't matter how good) 8 billion of turnover to do something that can be solved otherwise too?
@_date: 2015-03-23 10:36:38

@_date: 2015-11-11 17:36:48
I think he wants an automated solution. Sell everything at 400$ and after it sold, make a buy order for 300$. rinse repeat.  
 this can be done with pretty much every trading bot out there. But its rather complicated to get started with this (you need to run a server).
@_date: 2015-11-10 17:11:02
I have to give a small warning here. They do except bitcoin for over a year already. BUT! they don't allow Bitcoin withdrawals yet. So its a really bad situation as you can only use a method to withdraw that you already used to cashin.  
(This was the situation a few weeks ago, not sure if they changed the BTC withdrawal part).
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:53:09
Thank you!  Indeed, but those were good days too!

This option allows funds to flow into paypal but not out, that is the reason that there were no problems. I don't have anything to show publically. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:02:57
There is still a ton of people that need PayPal on a day to day basis. And we provide them a valuable service. Sorry to have offended you.
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:47:27
There is a 2% buy fee on our site, but for sells we currently give out the Kraken.com rate.
@_date: 2015-10-16 00:58:19
Haha, that is a good point. But with USD supported, it will atleast be more realistic to use our service.
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:43:59
Yes, non-merchant as in, no business account. You are quite certainly allowed to make Bitcoin related transactions.
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:24:59
Coinimal isn't charging any fees for PayPal payout, but PayPal charges the receiving party fees on commercial transfers.
@_date: 2015-10-16 00:51:28
Does any have automated payouts?
@_date: 2015-10-30 04:11:15
Ripple has no blockchain
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:47:30
Not too good tbh. There are only a handful of places to spend bitcoin offline. But if you are visiting in a few years, I am sure it will be much better then!
@_date: 2015-10-15 21:52:30
Yes, but first we need to integrate USD. Then CHF and GBP are next.
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:58:15
The transfer is in Euro. So if your account is in USD for example, you will get charged FX fees by PayPal. Once we have integrated USD, we will notify all our customers.
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:44:48
USD addition is basically the highest priority on our to-do list. Escpecially with Neteller, we get requests to add USD on a daily basis.
@_date: 2015-10-14 18:52:05
Yes, currently our focus is on Europe. We are constantly expanding and will soon be able to offer Neteller buy/sell in USD too. (Its already possible to use our Neteller service with a nonEuro account, but then you incur FX fees)

How do you mean exactly? This service allows you to sell Bitcoin and in return get a transfer on your PayPal account.
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:27:42
Well it is right on the frontpage in the Slogan. Also in the FAQ if i am not mistaken
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:48:53
Yes, from our side, there is no identity verification needed for this.

This service is automated and offered by an incorporated and fully regulatory compliant Austrian company. This is what is different.
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:33:06
Thank you, appreciate this!
@_date: 2015-10-15 22:54:25
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2015-10-15 22:53:40
This service is demanded by people that need a PayPal balance to either buy certain services that don't accept BTC directly or they need to pay someone who doesn't accept BTC.
@_date: 2015-10-20 17:10:17
He said 0% fee on both sides might be fake. Real markets never have both sides trading free
@_date: 2015-10-16 02:37:41
Yes I know but you often read about how people said: "even if the mining chip becomes obsolete I still have a full node".
Your product would have suited those people much better.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:51:47
What is a "virtual" currency? Lindendollars?
@_date: 2015-03-23 11:00:25
No added fee doesn't mean that there is no fee included in the price.
@_date: 2015-11-25 02:40:09
That is no way to treat customers. If they dont login, how do they actually agree to the TOS change? In europe this would never fly
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:01:12
The price on the homepage is just for buy orders. For sell orders we currently don't charge any fees and you get the current Kraken price.  
We also don't charge any fees for the PayPal transfer, but PayPal charges the receiving party fees.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:00:34
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:28:53
They are still not allowing non merchants to buy/sell Bitcoin commercially. This was the reason that many got banned in the past.
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:21:43
You are right that the first page doesn't give much information, but if you click on the next page, we tell this to our customers and even show the link to the exact fees. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:46:09
All time high
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:37:28
You can fund every currency account, but as the transfer will be in Euro, you will incur extra FX fees from PayPal.
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:18:09
Those companies need to be 100% sure that the customers will not be scamed. As Coinimal is an Austrian GmbH that is fully compliant with all regulations, this makes our partners very confindent that we will be able to provide a stellar service. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:41:37
Fixed, good eye!
@_date: 2015-10-14 19:28:00
back and forth means, they trade with themselves to push volume. No bid/ask spread if trading with yourself ;)
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:16:56
There is always the option to use a ATM or localbitcoins, but I don't see the issue with providing your verification details to reputable sites. Remember you are buying a non-reversible good with a reversible payment option. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 11:24:46
Its another algorithm. You cant compare them just with numbers
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:17:57
We do not know of any accounts that can't receive a normal transaction on PayPal. You don't need to request anything.
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:34:28
We are currently working on the terms of service. They should be available updated in EN and German soon.  
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:52:03
We worked with PayPal on this, so there is no reason to believe this option will be discontinued.
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:39:15
As we sell not only Bitcoin, what term would you rather see in this place?
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:34:00
No offense taken. Anyone should always be very careful with Bitcoin companies and do his/her own research. We had enough gox and iGots ;)
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:29:19
Every account can be funded, but there will be additional FX fees charged by PayPal.
@_date: 2015-10-15 22:00:38
Hallo! Thank you very much. Coinimal is currently not charging any fees for sell orders until the end of october. The only fees are on PayPals end when receiving funds.  
No plans as of yet, the retail exchange market is far from saturated on our end.
@_date: 2015-10-27 13:16:49
I added the volume chart in USD too:

@_date: 2015-10-15 20:53:29
Yes, regardless of this payout option we are currently integrating USD, but as with anything that involves bank accounts, this takes a while.  
You can find all fees for receiving PayPal payments and FX fees here:

Good idea!

We are a fully regulatory compliant company in Vienna Austria. We have been doing business for one year and have thousands of customers. You can read about us in every forum.
If you need any further proof let us know :)
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:14:08
Yes, those are completely free to use funds. If you are talking about Sepa bank account, you can just cashout to your bank account directly from Coinimal.
@_date: 2015-10-28 19:33:33
Who knows, but if you want to sell, you should choose the option where you get the most for your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-13 03:14:41
Why would you word a headline like that if half of the world reads 10.235 as 10235...
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:30:18
You are right, shouldn't have jinxed it!
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:06:57
Fixed, thank your for reporting.
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:48:16
Yes, USD will be next and soon after GBP and CHF. No ETA yet though.
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:10:08
This is for our affiliate/tell-a-friend program. People get paid in voucher balance, and they can redeem that balance with this option.
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:03:20
They do not charge any fees ontop of the price you see on the site. So even with SOFORT or GIROPAY its the same price.
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:01:44
Can this protocol also move around Tether? this would be nice, because then those exchanges can move around USD and BTC.
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:51:18
We will announce it on Twitter, Facebook, and Newsletter to all registered customers.
@_date: 2015-10-16 11:18:07
Yes! We can use it commercially :)

Sounds like Neteller wanted to make sure that your Net+ card was not stolen.  Glad to hear your account is open again.  
@_date: 2015-10-28 20:45:21
Natively not yet. But you can receive a Eur payment on Neteller and Paypal and it will automatocally be converted to USD
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:21:15
Right now if you register your email address, you instantly see the requirements.   
But you are more then right. I will add this information today! Seems vital.
@_date: 2015-10-15 22:44:03
Coinimal is offering the first fully automated method for getting funds on PayPal, which is pretty unique still.  
I agree, it would be cool to offer a PayPal to BTC service, but I don't know how anyone could offer this because of the extremely long chargeback period.
@_date: 2015-10-10 00:49:35
I would suggest using Neteller. They have the Net+ virtual card, which is perfect for what you need.  
If you want to fund the account with Bitcoin, you can do so using 
@_date: 2017-05-05 18:56:15
 1000€ with only an verified e-mail address. Up to 10000€ a day with a very quick verification

I have added it here:   
@_date: 2015-10-15 22:54:06
How far we have come!
@_date: 2015-10-14 19:30:03
You realize that spread is still a thing?
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:38:02
I also don't see why it can't be us. Haha :)
@_date: 2017-07-01 23:40:23
You could order 100 Macbook pro and resell them later for a higher price, while mining with them in the meantime. $100% profit
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:32:28
You can use SOFORT and SEPA to buy coins from Sweden. In the future we will add more regional payment methods though!
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:26:12
The price you see when ordering is the one you pay. There are no hidden paymentprovider fees for you. We pay for them.  
  
The overall price is usually around 2-3% above Bitstamp.  
When selling BTC to Coinimal the price is around 1% below bitstamp. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 13:04:59
Oh, yes they can indeed do the exchange themselves. But an external provider will not be able.
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:27:40
Fixed, thanks!
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:23:03
As mentioned on our website (on the second step), we don't charge any fees for this transfer because the receiver pays for commercial transfers on paypal.
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:44:44
@_date: 2015-10-16 10:56:42
This is very unlikely as the chargeback period for paypal is around 180 days, in that time there would be an extreme buildup of risk with the volume we are seeing.
@_date: 2015-10-14 18:56:58
To paraphrase: "Huge bitcoin volume on 0% fee exchanges in China over past 24 hours 1000 BTC have been traded back and forth until 1 million BTC volume was reached

If you follow us on twitter ( you will be notified when GBP integration goes live.
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:09:10
You can check our company registration in Austria online. The regulatory body in Austria is very strict, so we could not operate if we were not compliant.  
The best way to see this inaction is our partnership with Neteller. This is world-exclusive deal, that is only possible because we were able to show them our stellar operations.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:19:55

That is the first time we got that feedback regarding the name ;) 
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:25:44
We have received extremely positive feedback, either directly or on the several forum threads on bitcointalk, litecointalk and nxtforum.
@_date: 2015-11-06 18:55:42
This is in part due to many Bitcoin traders/investors closely following Gold news and thus creating a self-fullfilling prophecy.  
In fact, one of the biggest thread on Bitcointalk.org(it was deleted or moved a few months ago though) was called "Gold collapsing. Bitcoin UP."
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:00:23
I think we were able to get a good chunck from here: 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:14:21
Why is this being upvoted? Pure FUD!  
The BTC belong to coinbase (according to all 3 major tracking services) and the "laundering" is just splitting up funds so users can withdraw in anticipation of the BCC fork from coinbase...
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:19:47
Yes, it is 50€.

You only need to sign up with your email, not verification at all needed.

Export your private key and use electrum. Especially without an SSD it's very hard to fully sync up, and if you open the software again after a few weeks, the whole ordeal starts again.  
So either use Electrum &amp; co, or buy a SSD :)
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:48:26
This is just in the beginning, this feature went live today. We will have the same stock as SEPA very soon (you can sell multiple 10k€ each day there).

at  you can buy Bitcoins with SEPA and lock the price when doing the order. So given the huge swings right now, this can come quite handy! If you are verified you can buy 5000€ per day. The fee is 2% above Kraken.
@_date: 2015-10-15 23:14:50
But would you yourself really like to trade with some random person that can reverse the transaction for up to 180 days? Repurcessions against such traders are very hard to execute.
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:55:06
Such a news will never happen with

Coinbase confirmed that they have their funds in Shamir Secret Sharing Multisig wallet (starting with 1x instead of 3x) and there are about 10 wallets with roughly 66k BTC. So this matches them exactly and the 3 tracking services confirm this.   
Not sure what's up with btc-e, but the second part is just plain wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:24:41

You can use  for about 1% to cashout BTC to EUR.
