If it gains more users its flawed bandaid of a scaling solution will get ripped off for all to see. If it keeps losing users it will become useless even faster, as the squealing masses of ignorant investors watch the first negative report about it in the news and start divesting themselves faster than lice out of a flaming wig. 
It's a coin that's damned if it does, damned if it doesn't; a direct result of its origins being the devil's spawn of a 
 wrinkle-faced screaming man baby and a satanic tea party of sniveling foreign mining moguls. It's only capable of existing in this small window of time tracking Bitcoin because not enough new money has realized the trap door they fell into. Once Btrash gets exposed in the news or even just begins having negative price decouplement, that coin is going to go down like a house of cards on a propane stove with a blown out pilot in a room full of idling ford pintos.

Since you didn't flame at me I have no problem leaving politics out of this. But yes, the more people that learn how bad Roger is the more quickly we can stop new investors from falling prey to BCH thinking it's actually Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:21:55
I don't know how this hasn't been said yet, but the fees are high because a bunch of people are purposefully flooding the chain with bullcrap transactions with excessively high fees. It's currently the easiest way to attack Bitcoin... and it happened at almost the same time as Coinbase announcing Buttcash. Very very bad PR for Coinbase.

No, we need to get off our asses to educate people about why Bcash is a scam. It's not Bitcoin. It's one arrogant self-made multi-shillionaire's altcoin purpose-built for pump and dump insider trading. He was literally quoted on CNBC saying that insider trading is not a crime. He thinks it's great. 
The only thing holding up the price of Bcash is all the new investors getting tricked into buying it. It's not Bitcoin, it's an altcoin... and a shitty one by altcoin standards. 
Bcash needs to be amputated before it ruins the party.

Well, the supply also includes coins being held (not just mined), which can vary wildly  depending on how many people want to sell at a given time. When you see the price dip sharply it's because supply is drastically exceeding demand for that short time. What I meant by what I said is that the more "weak hands" get into crypto, the more the price is going to flip its shit when people manipulate it.

The first thing that will happen if BIP101 wins out is constant flooding of 8mb blocks. Your question should not be "should we be building for peak or average load", but "how will people try to break this".

Oh shit, it's for real this time. Just like it will be for real next time... and the time after that. Better dump everything so we can all buy back in "cheaper", because only "idiot bag holders" don't trade using a 5 minute chart and a ouija board.

Bitcoin Cash "users" must hold their coins like a ball and chain. They knew something like SegWit would come along someday, they just didn't know it was SegWit itself because they became entranced by the salacious siren's song of an autistic squealing donkey's asshole. If only they'd never touched their garbage coin, but it's too late now and they'll eat bubblegum from the undersides of Denny's tables at 3:00 AM for sustenance before they will take a loss.
"It wasn't a mistake. It wasn't a mistake." they chant in the shower whilst slamming their palms against the wall. A single tile falls loose at roughly the same time in each of their houses after months of this stress-induced psychotic behavior, but they don't even notice. "Why didn't Roger rapture me, why didn't he tell me to sell? He looked me in the eyes and told me to buy until the end..." 
Their food tastes of ash and soot, their wine like cat urine and vodka. Eyes swollen shut from grief, hunched backs from getting too close to their screens and breath so foul that tonsil stones burst forth as they speak, like their mouth is starting a food fight with a spoon full of cottage cheese. Their critical-hit body odor is butt the tip of the iceberg, as human waste management has long since been forgotten under countless layers of no longer tighty whities. Their aggressive behavior and aversion to direct sunlight are the final nails in their social coffins; to ensure that they abstain henceforth forevermore from venturing into the outside world... they belong to the forums, now. 
Well, that's how I imagine them, anyway.

S2X is a bullshit unnecessary potential hard fork being crammed down our throats by a bunch of drama queens. A contentious hard fork would be like if you got a flat tire, and the mechanic insisted that instead of fixing the tire you take it off the car and let it grow into an entirely new car except that all the tires on the new car will be fucked up and the mechanic insists it's a "feature" and all cars will eventually look like that anyway. Then, you ask why you would want a second fucked up car while you have a perfectly good one to drive... but then your jaw unhinges and you regurgitate a putrid wriggling percentage of your body mass that for some reason wants to drive the fucked up car so bad that it lurches onto the counter top and signs your credit card receipt and screams across the floor and out the door before limping away in the new shitty car. 
In the end, you can only watch as the malformed cancerous viscera you ejected falls behind in the rear view mirror, driving its shitty little car with flat tires and flipping you off. "You chose the wrong car!" It will squeal at you as you pass it going in the fast lane. "What the fuck just happened, that was weird, stupid, and unnecessary..." you will think to yourself before you completely forget about it... until the next flat tire.

Litecoin is turning into the "spendable" coin with faster transactions, low fees, and (currently) very high innovation. However, Bitcoin's slowness to adapt and consensus requirements are what make it so valuable as a RELIABLE store of wealth.
