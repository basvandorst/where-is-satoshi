Thanks! You helped me as well. I was able to successfully get into my old account using wallet.aes.json and the original encryption password. Sadly, there was not a bit of bitcoin in there. It was worth the trip down memory lane to see how much of a fortune I wasted.

Hope they accept bitcoin as payment.

Very common in India for many reasons.

Ahhh, see, I did multiple transaction this week. Maybe that's the reason for the lengthy amount of time. Makes more sense now.

I've been around since April and haven't done anything risky. Not sure why this happened. Never been an issue before. Weird.

My solution: My fiancee is Chinese and has a legit ID number. I use my own tenpay account (which, be careful, it has to match your *exact* legal name including capitalization that you used with BTC China). The problem is, BTC China doesn't work well with long english names - and neither did tenpay. So it involved multiple skype calls with broken mandarin/english and my fiancee laughing at me and cursing the representatives in Chinese to get things fixed. Once I got the cash into tenpay, I could transfer from my tenpay account to hers, and she gives me the current RMB to USD exchange rate and then buys stuff on taobao with the money. 
Brace yourselves for an adventure. 
I still haven't found a way to link my legitimate Bank of China account with my tenpay account. I probably never will :(
EDIT: The BTC China site operators are REALLY nice. They even called my US phone and helped me troubleshoot their side of the issues. I was so incredibly impressed. Tenpay and Bank of China could care less about you.

Hey Charlie - It went through! I'd love to know the reason... usually it's fantastic, but every once awhile I see this problem. Thanks again for the pledge to help - it means a lot to me!

Very interesting - thanks for the analysis. Just curious (and I am totally uninformed) - would there be a big risk "collecting funds for a set of transfers into a common account." Why do you think they went the route they did with "spending outputs before the transactions have confirmed"? Just easy, I suppose? 
Are there things the bitcoin network could do to confirm their own transfers faster? For example, could I set up a dedicated team of blockchain agents that are only tasked with confirming transactions that deal with my account? I guess my problem is I don't understand how transactions on the blockchain are confirmed. How can I setup an agent to help confirm transactions?

Yes, I have bought and sold in BTC china, but I have never gotten fiat money out (or in) from it. I've only been able to trade bitcoins. When you sell, it converts it to fiat RMB currency, which you should be able to exchange into a Chinese bank account or a paypal like service such as "tenpay". Unfortunately, signing up for tenpay *requires* a Chinese ID number (kind of like a social security number on steroids) which, if you type in a fake one or one that doesn't belong to you, you won't be able to link any Chinese bank accounts (and they don't support non-chinese bank accounts - welcome to China).

Ah, good point. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:56:46
Glad I'm not the only one. Hopefully they get to a root cause of sorts and help show us how they plan to fix the problem in the future. I'd like to keep using them, but these type of repetitive issues are making me potentially look to other providers who are more reliable. Do you recommend other providers?

Thank you as well!

I have a chinese bank account and I'm experimenting with it now (little late to the game). Let me know what you've found - would be interested

Ah, see, that's the part I don't get. If miners are responsible for confirming transactions, and if miners work on problems that get incrementally harder and harder... doesn't that mean that confirming transactions with a steady state of miner processing power would mean confirmations would take longer and longer? I need to find some material that explains this better because I must be missing something.

Thanks, this makes sense!

I've been scammed using venmo for bitcoins. The scammer used a fraudulent credit card and, even though the funds showed up in my account and I cashed them out, Venmo reversed the charges. The scammer even had a decent history and reviews. Don't use venmo with strangers, EVER. 
Here was their response:
Our fraud &amp; risk team has been reviewing this case and, unfortunately, you have been the victim of a scam. Your transactor was using stolen cards to send you payments. As such, the payments were reversed to the original owners of the cards and the user and all associated accounts have been blacklisted and prohibited from transacting further.
Fraudsters often take on several identities and are able to scam many people (and sometimes even the same person) en masse. However, at this point we do not offer any buyer or seller protections: this is why we prohibit merchant transactions on Venmo (per section C.1.b. of our user agreement). In particular, we strongly discourage using Venmo for buying and selling bitcoins, as they are a frequent medium for fraudulent behavior.
Privacy laws prevent us from sharing much information about this case. However, in hopes of preventing similar incidents going forward we are reviewing our terms of use and considering adding more explicit warnings against using Venmo for bitcoin exchange.
Venmo is a simple way for friends to send each other money, and it is not designed for uses beyond this purpose. Please let me know if there's anything else we can do for you (bearing in mind that I can't divulge much beyond what I've provided here).
