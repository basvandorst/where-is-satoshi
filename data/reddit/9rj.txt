Same here. If I had enough Bitcoin I would probably back it up on a flash drive and store it offline somewhere but as of now I'm not losing any sleep over this.

This isn't exactly foolproof logic. I believe in decentralised cryptocurrencies and that it is an idea which will survive whatever is to come. Bitcoin is a single cryptocurrency and it though it is the strongest one right now it might not always be. There might also be some truth to what they're saying about BCH carrying forward the original vision of Bitcoin. 
I don't see enough people here discussing the shortcomings of bitcoin and trying to learn from other altcoins and innovating for the way ahead. I honestly couldn't care less which cryptocurrency comes out on top which is why I can see clearly enough to tell you that Bitcoin could fall at any time. You should keep yourself informed, and being a little worried is healthy.

There are a lot of search results, but all of them were older results and they don't have any information on what happened recently to cause this. 
I found an explanation now.

Thanks, I think this is the problem. I'm currently on 0.13
I'm using Bitcoin-QT on Ubuntu (installed from the Bitcoin repo) and this isn't showing any available updates yet so I guess I'll just wait till an update is available. 
Any information on what change caused 0.13 to be incompatible?

Nevermind, I seem to have found the answer here:

Do you know any of the other places accepting Bitcoin in Bangkok? I'm gonna be in Bangkok next week but sadly I'm arriving on Tuesday and leaving on Sunday. I would have loved to come for one of the meetups otherwise.

I'd given them my account details way back in May or June when the IAFCU took over. I'd honestly given up on seeing that money again so I was pleasantly surprised when I found this cheque in the mail. I didn't follow up with them or anything. There's still hope for your money. :)

That's scary.

I can't figure out how to claim it. :S
I'm quite new to Reddit as well.

I'd like some. And I'll make sure to pass on half of it to someone else. :D
