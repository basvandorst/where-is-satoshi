This regulation is taken out of context. Coinbase is working through a US financial institution to complete a valid ACH transfer which would not qualify as a "restricted transaction".

Is this solvency related or is it perhaps part of the ongoing money laundering/Silk Road investigations?
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:25:26
Does "sold" mean that the person actually got cash??? I don't see how there is any selling going on at all on Gox…
**Clarification:** Is this just people at MtGox trading with each other?

If I was verified I'd do it… not a lot but definitely something.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:07:52
4 hours ago I would have said yes… That said, I'm a little surprised they haven't made an announcement yet so maybe not.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:55:38
I don't really care who buys it as long as the price stabilizes...
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:43:55
Right with you! Wish I could buy more right now!

Be sure to generate the paper wallet on an offline PC and remove any history of it before going back online - it's easier said than done, but I wouldn't consider it secure if you are generating the paper wallet on a PC that you regularly use to browse the internet.

Maybe we should upvote this question so the answer stays visible. Downvoting obviously preventing it from being asked repeatedly....

Completely agree! I need to look up bitfinex but no luck shorting so far!

Careful - it gets addicting… it's easy to lose money in a hurry when the markets turns around.

this site is spamming like crazy - 3rd post i've seen with a link to this site.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:47:20
Fine for me also
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:54:26
I think it peaked at $480 for right now.
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:51:40
It's a full time job keeping up with this sub...
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:47:22
not likely
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:24:13
Worth it at this point - no issues to report so far but you should definitely set up 2 factor authentication.
@_date: 2014-03-13 06:21:56
Might not want to tell your wife you used bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:24:49
Not even close - Overstock and Tigerdirect are a drop in the bucket. This is a necessary lull and regrouping before another HUGE run-up. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:46:31
I just want it to hit so I can go to bed… I'm currently short sold on coinsetter.com but I could lose money in a hurry if there's good news from GOX! Can't sleep...
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:47:43
Who the hell knows - this thing's a freaking mess.
@_date: 2014-03-13 06:19:35
I believe institutional investors are going drive the price up significantly.
@_date: 2014-01-22 06:41:21
Completely agree with Cowboy except for Coinbase Paper Wallets. 
I wouldn't use a browser based paper wallet generator on a device that regularly connects to the internet. You're better off relying on coinbase to protect the BTC they are managing on your behalf than generating a paper wallet on a device connected to the internet that could have malware.
If you are going to generate paper wallets, download the source code for a site (bitaddress.org) and run it offline, preferably on a device or OS that won't connect to the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:33:57
How? Was it sent to the original wallet the you used to fund the Gox account?
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:35:09
There's a new spam post on this sub every 5 minutes... "Just lost 325 BTC" 
Am I the only one seeing them before they're deleted?
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:56:26
3600 BTC (about $1.8MM) generated today and the price was relatively stable...
With a market cap of under $10B, it is not outside the realm of possiblity to have a single, albeit very wealthy, investor cause a MAJOR run-up let alone an entire market moving towards a higher price. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 06:45:47
Withdraw cash at an ATM and connect with someone on Localbitcoins.com to buy.
You'll need to create a wallet (Address) first in order for the person you connect with to transfer to BTC to you. If you are brand new to bitcoin I'd recommend setting up a coinbase.com account since they'll manage your wallets. 
If your coinbase account starts to grow too much beyond $100 you'll want to figure out a better option for managing your own wallet and securing your BTC. 
**edit:** You may have trouble setting up a conibase.com account if you don't have a bank account...
Good Luck!
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:46:26
I second coinbase.com
Be prepared to hand over your identity and bank information. Depending on where you bank, and how fast coinbase can validate your bank account, you may be able to buy coins at tonights price. But you won't have a decent instant buy limit for at least 30 days. Bend over and get in line...
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:46:07
Definitely set up 2 factor authentication for all transactions under account settings. 
I'd even consider setting up 2FA with your e-mail provider since the email can be used to gain access and/or reset your password.
I haven't read any posts where someone with 2FA actually lost money. That said, I personally use coinbase to buy/sell and then store in a paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:15:01


It was kind of implied when you said "they're required". Unless Chase is the only bank that must comply with the statute that you quoted and I should have obviously known that.
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:26:24
The chart looks a lot like the other exchanges over the past few days only they've settled at $630 USD. Gox is alive and well and will be raking in purchase/transfer fees until their trading price joins the rest of the exchanges. I'd guess it's not going to take that long...
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:20:49
I thought of the T-Mobile ad when I read the news today about Apple &amp; Blockchain... I've been on the iPhone since day 1 but they are really starting to piss me off. First the coinbase app and now Blockchain!!!
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:05:32
Good video - I can't think of anything having a more positive impact on BTC price than institutional investors in Wall Street getting in.
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:38:17
I would never send cash in the mail... 
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:10:05
40% is a lot to lose! How is money lost from a wallet controlled by the person unless it is mismanaged in some way? The question is, whether you or your exchange are more likely to mismanage the coin.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:10:39
The "payment system" that is referenced in the *statute* that you have quoted is the ACH which is governed but the NACHA rules. I don't believe the RDFI has obligations under the NACHA rules to identify restricted transactions and block them. I believe this would be the responsibility of the ODFI to not process them in the first place (the bank Coinbase is working with to originate the transactions). I'm not claiming to be an expert in banking compliance but I think you are overstepping to say that all banks are required to block Coinbase transactions based on this statute…
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:51:01
I'm assuming Gox gets withdrawals working again… 
I'd buy $250 BTC all day long if I could transfer to Cold storage or cash out on coin base for $630 USD. It's impossible for the price to stay where it is **IF** the pipes start flowing again.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:29:54
I don't think the Goldfinger philosophy pans out at this stage. If tech savvy exchanges can't manage crypto how can the average user?
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:15:26
LOL - that's pretty funny

My actual Bank Account... Anyone else trying to buy or sell coins based on market fluctuations over the past few weeks.

Apple has pretty much killed every BTC trading app :-(
Never been so tempted to switch to droid before.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:06:24
Or you could have sold short at $450 and now you'd be down $150... I don't recommend day trading!
@_date: 2014-03-25 05:08:27
Agreed - I'd have jumped at the chance to put cash into a machine and buy BTC before I got verified with Coinbase. Not much need for me to do it today, but if it helps someone else buy in I'm all for it!
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:42:02
I have the same christmas tree stand :-)
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:17:49
We'll know once Gox starts allowing withdrawals again. Excessive selling drives the price down and people aren't able to sell today. 
One thing is certain, if the withdrawals start working again, the price can't sit at 1/2 the rest of the market for long… If it does, I'll certainly be jumping through their archaic hoops to get validated so I can buy $250 BTC!
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:10:45
How could they be insolvent when they could be making 100% - 500% arb trades for over a week?

Definitely use coinbase but be warned that Chase customers have had their accounts closed for interacting with Coinbase... I haven't had any issues with Wells Fargo.

A completely "offline" brainwallet generator for someone that doesn't want to build their own ISO (if that's the correct term).
Basically a "turnkey" bootable USB drive that can plug into any computer for the creation of paper wallets. Ideally a command prompt would appear after booting which asks the user to enter 62 random numbers (base 6) and then return the corresponding public/private address which should be written down by hand. 
Special thanks to moral_agent! I've practiced and used his offline brainwallet method many times.  I've been very concerned with finding a way to convert my coinbase balance to COLD storage but I have no experience with Linux/Ubuntu and the thought of it was daunting. If I didn't have an old PC that is completely disconnected from the internet, I'd probably still be looking for a way to do it.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:01:32
It was exciting though… I'm getting pretty tired/bored.

The only way to spend bitcoin is by knowing the private key that corresponds with it. By leaving the bitcoin in an exchange like MtGox, the users are trusting the exchange to manage the private keys on their behalf. If MtGox disappears, so do the users coins
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:53:50
Erased would be back up to $850... Gox has been supressing the market for weeks.

I believe transaction level 2FA is still an opt in setting though you are correct that it is required at login... 
I don't think they'll become illegal in the US any time soon but depending on how much you plan to keep there, it's definitely a valid concern.
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:21:26

I started at $765 over a week ago but it's incredibly hard to time the swings. 
You end up buying back and missing opportunities on the downward movements and/or selling short right before the price bounces back up… my current position is $630 (today's average).
