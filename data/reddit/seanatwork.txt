Still faster than playing the dwolla transfer game to Campbx. Although Campbx's fee is less than half of Coinbase's. Coinbase still lets you lock in the price before the transfer which is nice. Once they up the $100 limit they will get a lot more interest I bet.
@_date: 2012-09-05 02:17:40
Yeah I just noticed they have a verification thing and I'd have to send it forms to withdrawl to dwolla. So I guess I'm gonna sit on my bitcoin with no easy way to convert them to USD. Too bad I was planning on depositing a portion of my paycheck each week too.

I've only did it once and I charged around 4%. And if someone is only buying $60 worth whats the point of taking the time to schedule a meeting and meet them some where. Maybe I'll set a minimum purchase amount. I'm also interested in this as I recently signed up and got 4-5 offers to buy right off the bat.
@_date: 2012-11-27 21:52:46
I think they allow you to cancel transactions now. Not sure how long you have after you place it to cancel it though.

This could be easily solved with a trusted 3rd party. I want to buy something from you, but I also want to make sure you will ship it and won't just keep the money. It goes to the third party intermediary and they hold it waiting for a shipping confirmation/delivery confirmation. Once it's provided you get the funds.
There could also be an alternative reputation system similar to ebay so buyers have more confidence in a seller and maybe could save on the fees by bypassing the third party if the rating is high enough.

But it is a feature to the people who are using paypal and are tired of their funds being frozen for days and days until the issue is resolved. Yeah charge-back management should be talked about more and promoted more, I guess it's not as easy to explain as irreversible transactions.
@_date: 2012-10-17 14:21:29
Exactly this. You have to give up privacy to use bitcoin to it's full extent (convenience and low fees) or pay very high fees. Considering privacy and no fee transactions are what separates bitcoin from competing methods of payment this is the problem. When merchants start offering a discount to use bitcoins like gas stations do for cash, that would be an incentive for buyers.

Wow and the cash deposit at wachovias and ACH withdrawl were such great features. Simple interface too. I feel for the people who lost. But really after the MTgox hack last year how could you leave any substantial amount of money on the exchange? Trade and withdrawl immediately after to your wallet. I guess back to MTgox I go.

Installing a game to buy bitcoins...So you could eventually get bitcoins with a credit card this way? After a couple of hoops? Seems like a good way make risky investments in a lot of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2012-09-30 01:43:14
The trick comes when you want to cash out and get to your bank via ACH. Bitfloor requires id. Unless you can somehow locally sell a ton of bitcoins to someone anonymously.

Oh cool thanks. I haven't checked out bitmit yet.

This is a good point. I haven't purchased or sold more than $300 worth of merch in cash off of craigslist in one transaction. I have purchased more than $300 worth of bitcoins in one transaction.

I think it's a dumb ass reason to not donate just because they don't accept bitcoin. They are a 501c3 and they've decided to play in the system. If they were totally outside the system then it would make more sense.
Don't donate for any other number of reasons but they offer a lot of different donation options and not accepting bitcoin has to be the worst reason to not donate.
@_date: 2012-11-16 20:09:13
This article is vague as hell. I assumed they were talking about getting loans to open a business but it's really referring to being able to take debit card transactions? What a horribly written article. A lot of small shops are cash/check only and it's not that big a deal. Not ideal but it's not like they can't open or something.
@_date: 2012-07-21 11:32:03
Sounds great if you live within a days drive of a chase... : ) . I also would recommend popmoney but they blocked me after the first transaction. My bank told me to call them. Nice...
@_date: 2012-12-13 17:16:33
Mtgox and Campbx are cheaper ways but they're more hassle though. It really matters how many you want to buy and if the .5 percent or so difference matters to you for the inconvenience.

What organization can I donate to? What are you so afraid of? The US government isn't going to go after a lonely individual for exchanging a few bucks with an iranian in a currency they don't even acknowledge?

@_date: 2012-09-30 14:11:54
Yeah it's much easier to get in than get out. I think the convenience of cashing out will come with more volume of transactions and stability of the price. 
What do you mean by tumble? Is that easy? If the gmen come for peeps I don't think they can force them to reveal your passwords although the court has been wishy washy on it.
@_date: 2012-10-23 20:47:51

What about storing it online in an account? And no i don't mean like a backup copy on dropbox that you have to update everytime you receive a transaction. Assuming you do. I haven't even sent/received any bitcoins yet so i'm not sure. 
I dont keep cash under the mattress so why would I keep a significant chunk in a hidden folder on the computer? Isn't that why its called a bitcoin wallet and not a bitcoin safe.

I know in VA it's 3.5 percent and they don't care if you traded peanuts for the car you still pay it unless it's a gift from a relative. If the sales price is lower than the NADA value i'm pretty sure they charge you the higher of the two.
@_date: 2011-07-27 23:19:18
More taxes and more confusing tax law is good for business. If there was no income tax turbo tax would be out of business. This is a threat because if it becomes easy to send money avoiding taxes and get away with it then that's less money claimed as taxable therefore less need for turbotax to get all those deductions etc.

Makes sense to me. The only issue is getting it viral and actually easy to use. Mybitcoin.com is very easy to use but not exactly safe like a bank for a lot of cash. Ease of use and protection from inflation would be enough to put it over the top for people I think.

I don't know how much this applies to other bitcoin users but this is spot on with me. I first heard about bitcoin through more technical channels but didn't checkout bitcoin in more depth until memorydealers ran bitcoin live reads on Freetalklive. It basically involves them stating checkout this alternative currency at weusecoins.org
@_date: 2011-07-23 00:59:51
So use more than one wallet? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:57:18
I don't agree with most of these arguments and this is the same guy who believes taxes are NOT theft. 
But the one argument that is hard to ignore is that the supply of bitcoins does increase everyday and unless demand is met the price will drop at the minimum gradually over time. With many headwinds (regulation, negative press, fees, complexity for regular users) it seems to me the price is most likely still heading for the time being.

Sorry you're having issues. Coinbase hasn't been much better for me. I haven't been able to withdrawal 10 btc for 18 days. I've contacted their support 5+ times (even on twitter) and posted here on reddit. I got a response from them once or twice but they didn't fix anything.
I've even purchased a small amount since then and was able to withdrawal fine, go figure.

That's why you make a digital "paper wallet" called a TEXT file and encrypt it.  But then you get nervous and forget your password.

Because of money. They're only thinking of short term profits (being regulated means more reach and more potential customers) and aren't thinking about the long term benefits of technology like bitcoin can have on monetary freedom for everyone. The government didn't stop bittorent and they won't stop bitcoin it's just a matter of time.

Yeah it's entirely plausible to happen though to many people. You can never be 100% secure it's really easy to fubar and lose coins. 
Imagine waking up and checking the price and it's $0.87 dollars a coin. Then who cares if you remember the password or not haha. I think of it like Sonic you coul dahve collected all the coins in the level but if you run into a goomba you lost all those coins.

Watch your local Pbs and you will see them talking about how imperialism and us intervention is "a good thing". Also espousing the virtues of equality when that's just a euphimism for increasing taxes and redistributing other peoples money. This is just an episode preaching to the choir in the other direction and there's nothing wrong with that every once in a while.
@_date: 2013-09-18 17:44:32
I also have this problem. Luckily it's only 10. I'm hoping it gets resolved soon or BTC goes over the price I paid and I will just sell them back. I've tried over 4 times to send them over a period of 18 days. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:06:46
Doesn't matter if it only goes up a few percent in a few days if you don't buy you miss it. Nobody knows.
