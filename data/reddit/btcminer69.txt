Hello Takashi_Satori,
can you provide me the address you sent the bitcoins to or/and the transaction hash? There were two games so far with a 0.01 bet this week, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday. Both were played to the end. Then there were two games with a bet, where play wasn't started. In both cases the bets were returned, one of them was for 0.01 BTC.
EDIT: No downvote from my side, btw. You'll get an upvote from me anyhow.

Hi Takashi_Satori,
I'm still waiting for your reply on my private message or earlier post. Even day and time would help, or just the used bitcoin address.
Just a little inside how the game works: First you enter a withdrawal address (see later why this is important). After that a deposit address is generated and displayed. Right then the data (withdrawal address, deposit address, gamekey) is stored in the database. The page refresehs itself every 30 seconds, looking up possible deposits and confirmations. If however something goes wrong and you can't play but already send bitcoins, here's what follows: A cronjob checks every hour for created games that weren't started within 12 hours. The deposit address of those games will be checked for a deposit (should be confirm within 12 hours). If there is a deposit for an unstarted game, the amount is queued to be send to the withdrawal address (why it's important to enter it as the first step). This withdrawal queue (winnings, refunds, referral earnings) is check every five minutes and the transactions are performed with the transaction hash as response saved to the database.
So, if you can give me anything (deposit address, transaction hash) I'll be happy to check and help you.
