So I found out that I was trying to load the wallet into Bitcoin.com's desktop client, not the Bitcoin Core client that it was from. It's currently synchronizing with the network, but the transactions come up showing that I may have 0.3063718 BTC in it. Let me you what. I might cry if I actually encrypted it. It didn't ask for any decryption key when I replaced the wallet.dat file with my old one, though.....

[MRW I found my old wallet.dat file and it's encrypted....](
I started mining back in 2014 when it was somewhat profitable, and I know it wouldn't be a lot of bitcoin in it. But damn past-me for locking this shit with a password that wasn't one of my usual ones.

I just transferred the BTC I've had in my mobile wallet for the last two years. I scanned the QR Code and it read it just fine. Checked the transaction and it sent it to a completely different address. :)
thats cool.
**EDIT**: That's weird. It went into my exchange account wallet using a different receiving address.

Not to burst anyone's bubble, but that ripped sticker on the original label means the drive was replaced because of fault. It's a RMA sticker to identify it. I had a bunch of drives at work with them.

Yeah it did me a fright.

How can I buy Bitcoins with Visa gift cards without having to do a verification step? I don’t want to go through the hassle of that and would prefer it remain as anonymous as possible. I know I can use them on virwox.com by paying with PayPal, but it has to be verified and I can’t do that. 
I just want to enter the card details and click buy. I went to this one site where there’s thousands of sellers but every single one that claimed to not require ID asked me to upload a picture ID. 
Paxful says it’s not available in the US and CEX.io doesn’t offer service in my state for some stupid ass reason.
