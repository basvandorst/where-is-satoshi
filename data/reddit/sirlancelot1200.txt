Hello! congrats on your decision to buy Bitcoin.
Don't fall for the unit bias. Just because 1 XRP is worth only a few cents doesn't mean its cheap. If you look at Bitcoin in terms of Satoshis (smallest unit) you can currently buy 10700 Satoshis for only 1USD. So with 100$ you can already be a Satoshi millionaire! [ Currently you would need 300000$ to become an XRP millionaire.
The only truly decentralized cryptocurrencies without a leader are Bitcoin and Grin.
Buying 100$ of Bitcoin a month is an excellent strategy. Here you can see how this strategy has worked in the past [

Great, you follow good security practices unlike many people, except revealing them in detail on the internet.
The seed of the Model T can be extracted if not protected by a passphrase and there is no fix:
The title of my post says Trezor is only secure with a passphrase which is absolutely correct. For that reason you use one. I just wanted to point out that many people wont use the Trezor + passphrase in a secure way and that Ledger is more convenient because there is no seed extraction attack and the passphrase handling is more convenient.

yes 25th word is the passphrase. A secure passphrase consists of 8 random words or 20+ random characters. It is very annoying to type this every time on the Trezor screen.

Coinbase Pro and Bakkt warehouse are probably safer for the average investor. They are partly insured and their wallets are secured by multisig, with keys located in different locations, protected by armed guards 24/7.
On the flipside, these companies are targeted by hackers every day and if their cold storage gets emptied there is no insurance.
If you buy Bitcoin anonymously on [bisq.network]( or [hodlhodl.com]( or at a Bitcoin ATM with a hat and sunglasses on, and if you don't tell anyone you bought Bitcoin, you will never even be considered as a target by hackers or thieves. Just have to keep multiple backups of your wallet at different locations and you cant loose your coins.

What is Bitcoin?
1. the most secure financial ledger in the world. You can use it to transfer billions of dollars worldwide to anybody.
2. Inflation resistant hard money. There will only ever be 21 million coins. Bitcoin can never be created by the state and private banks.
3. programmable money. You can write little programs with the Bitcoins scripting language.
Why does Bitcoin have value?
Modern technologies usually capture value by disrupting old technologies.
These are old technologies or industries that can be disrupted by Bitcoin:
* **Gold** (Bitcoin is rarer and more practical than gold)
* **Money** (Bitcoin is sound money with a fixed inflation schedule that goes towards 0)
* **Savings accounts** (negative interest rates vs appreciating asset)
* **Stocks** (other digital assets can be created on Bitcoin side chains like the Liquid network)
* **Remittances** (send Bitcoin to anyone in the world for a few cents vs 10% Western Union fees)
* **Black markets** (people will prefer to buy their stuff online from vendors with positive reviews vs. the scary guy on the street)
* **Tax havens** (Swiss bank account in your pocket)
If Bitcoin only disrupts some of these industries it can attain a multi trillion dollar market cap.

It is scientifically proven. To attack Bitcoin, Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash you need to do a 51% attack. The cost of the attack increases with the hashrate of the network. Bitcoin by far has the highest hashrate of all cryptos, therefore it is the most secure.

I don't buy the argument. People will still have wants and needs and companies will still want to innovate. Some forms of spending would be dis-incentivized which could be a good thing. A debt-fueled economy with easy money produces a lot of bullshit since people don't need to put in a lot of effort into fundraising. In a Bitcoin world there wont be much easy money floating around funding bullshit.
A Bitcoin world could incentivize thoughtful spending which could lead to a more sustainable world.

He sold everything at around 16-18k. Many of his clients sold at 6k. Many did not sell and he strongly suggested that selling at 3k is a good idea.

Bitcoin surprisingly may turn out to be part of the solution to climate change. Energy companies can now monetize excess energy and renewable energy that is too remote for civilizations by mining Bitcoin. Energy companies will be incentivized to improve renewable energy conversion to compete in Bitcoin mining. This of course will benefit everyone.

High net worth individuals, institutions and nation states are more important for Bitcoin price appreciation than the average guy. And they mostly care about the security. They don't care if their billion dollar transaction takes 10 or 50 minutes to confirm.
The average guy who likes to smoke weed will appreciate that he can buy his shit online with bitcoin and wont care about a 10 to 50 minutes confirmation time either.
Bitcoin doesn't need to disrupt Visa, Paypal and apple pay.
If Bitcoin disrupts gold, savings accounts, the black market, tax havens and partly government currency in countries with weak currencies it will have a valuation of around 50-100 trillion dollars.

Yes, darknet market transactions occur in Bitcoin most of the time because it is the most liquid and adopted cryptocurrency. Every crypto exchange trades Bitcoin and there are thousands of Bitcoin ATMs world wide.

I will soon submit another post where Tyler and Leah tell someone to sell at 3k.
You should never blame someone else for your decisions and notice that neither OP nor anybody in the comments has done so.
But they have been selling paid webinars and seminars to scared people... so I think its fair to warn people

do you have evidence that futures are killing Bitcoin? (price decline after CME is not evidence that futures are killing Bitcoin because the volume was very small in the first weeks of trading).

There is no reason to use their eBTC because BTC can be sent electronically while cash cant. We have to rely on banks to send fiat. This is the key difference.

yes they should. but instead they shill Shitcoins. Avoid Coinbase.

The total amount of bitcoin is hardcoded to 21 million. Every 10 minutes a miner gets rewarded 12.5 Bitcoin. The reward gets halved every 4 years until 21 million coins exist.

Bitcoins price went down significantly in 2011 and 2014 too. Both times people said "the bubble has popped"
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:25:38
By the time Bitcoin reaches Gold marketcap of 7 trillion USD one Satoshi will be worth 0.0033$.
If Bitcoin overtakes Gold and reaches for example a 30 trillion USD marketcap one Satoshi will be worth 0.014$. This would still work for the global currency use case.
If Bitcoin goes to 100 Trillion, then one Satoshi will be worth a lot more than 1 cent but this would still not be an issue because the Bitcoin units in the Lightning Network are endlessly divisible. You can send fractions of a Satoshi on the Lightning Network.

dont think you will get less than one percent fees but fees are worth it if it means that nobody knows that you own Bitcoin. If hackers get coinbase customer data some people will be at risk of violent extortion.

Crypto is difficult tech. The team studied all available options and chose to use the Liquid Bitcoin side chain. K.im is already being used by thousands of beta testers.

Banks can try to manipulate the price but they can't change the fact that there will only ever be 21 million coins. Scarcity over the long run will win against their manipulation techniques. Maybe there are banks, probably outside of the US and Europe that want to manipulate the Bitcoin price to the upside to weaken the dollar and the euro...

If you don't need your $1000 for food, rent or electricity then I think you can take the risk to buy Bitcoin. Search the internet for Bitcoin stock-to-flow ratio and Quantitative Easing. Bitcoin can go to 100k and beyond. Good luck! There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins. Check out [bitcoineasy.github.io]( for a very simple introduction on Bitcoin.

Kim is releaseing a platform where you can store your content on a dozen of centralized and decentralized cloud storage platforms and make them available to people automatically after a Bitcoin or kim coin payment.
This will be a game changer. This could onboard millions of people to Bitcoin and show the Cryptoworld that you can have tokens on Bitcoin side chains like the Liquid network.

The node validates and verifies transactions. This means you can’t receive fake Bitcoins. It also gives you better privacy.
@_date: 2019-09-30 19:28:44
The consensus mechanism assumes that everybody is honest until proven otherwise. So every transaction is confirmed until someone can prove that a transaction is fraudulent.
This is worse than the current financial system. When someone transfers money out of your account or Visa card you can just call your bank to reverse the transaction without proving anything.

It has not been lost. A couple hours ago there were 38000 transactions waiting to get confirmed. Now the mempool is down to 16000 unconfirmed transactions.
On  you can see how full the mempool is and how much people are paying for transactions.
@_date: 2019-09-30 18:56:56
It will get confirmed in about 24 hours.

In my opinion a hardware wallet is your best option. New models like the Trezor Model T, the Ledger Nano X and the Shift Bitbox 02 use touch screeens, or touch buttons, and have a well thought out UX that makes typing in the seed phrase fast, which you only need to do once when setting them up, and eventually if you loose the HW and want to restore a new HW. Everything else is done in a desktop or mobile app. The device will only ask you to confirm addresses and transactions. All three models use USB C which wont get replaced anytime soon. The Ledger Nano X also works over Bluetooth.
The only exploits that exist require physical access to the HW and don't work if your seed phrase is encrypted with a pass phrase.
Check out this video by Andreas Antonopolous on HW security and how to store your seed and pass phrase: [

Crypto exchanges can be very frustrating. Some let you deposit funds without KYC and then only let you withdraw once you verify your identity.
