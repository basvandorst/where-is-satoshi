Not really because BTC is a stock not a currency. Why are everyone on this reddit so full of hate and sarcasm? Fine, I'm a retard please explain to me why you believe in BTC?

I don't care about bcash or any other crypto I'm just trying to get answers because like me and many of us want to get Rich but not in that perspective but in the perspective to keep the fruits of our labor.

Peer to Peer is me giving you something in person why should I pay so much on fees thus a contradiction to peer to peer 2. Fees are so high how can a poor person even be a part of this system if the entire idea is to treat btc as cash not as a stock. 3. You're doing word gymnastics with peer-peer-peer-peer because peer to peer there is no 3rd party otherwise it is a contradiction. 4. Miners are the people doing the POW and POS and Satoshi said  **"As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers."**   The incentive **may help encourage** nodes to stay honest.

In fact the road never got longer it just got filled with traffic is that not the reason BTC high fees? what is the incentive here if we can temporarily increase the block size and work on the lighting network too?

When the fees went through the roof and it was no longer used as digital cash because you couldn't do peer to peer without paying large fee. Since when should you in person give me something in person Peer to Peer and cost me say 3$? that's not peer to peer anymore because the idea was anyone who use this as cash even poor people can do it with half or a quarter of a penny.

Peer to peer is like person to person why should I pay such a high fee if the road isn't longer it just has a lot of traffic? Bitcoin is censorship resistant yes but the fees are so large and getting higher with even more unconfirmed transactions than how is a poor person in a country to have any voice to for example give BTC onchain to wikileaks?
