This is actually really good news. I'm glad they're making progress.

Well, you can't be sure what will happen next, but it is very peculiar that right now you can buy coins at way too low rates. The problem is that it is uncertain wether Mt Gox will recover at all, and this uncertainty PLUS the fact nobody can withdraw any money whatsoever, makes people sell their bitcoins at lower rates, because they think if they have their money stored in Dollars, they might have a better chance at getting it back with a bit of help from the government. For Bitcoins this is harder for obvious reasons.
Personally I would advise against buying BTC at Mt Gox at the moment, unless you know what you're doing.

It's an unfathomably high amount of bitcoins. You can't just lose those without noticing. The entire exchange is focused on money and trading bitcoins, so reasonably they **should** notice if even only five bitcoins go missing.

Sweet, that's something I can tell my grandchildren.

It's a worthless statement. Any company would make that claim.

Meanwhile in the comment section: "Where is my bitcoin?!"
They're working on fixing it though. I assume they're not trying to scam people.

Yahoo frontpage, welp, it's something.

I bought 2 bitcoins at 660 about 3 weeks ago, I just held on to them long enough and today I finally break even :) But it's no time to sell yet !

I live in the Netherlands myself. I feel like I still lack options to actually spend my bitcoins, and by creating this thread I hope some good online stores can get exposure.

So, how is this website viable?
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:01:20
Gotta be original !

I'd like to know this too.
