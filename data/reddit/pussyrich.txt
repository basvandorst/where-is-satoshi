Depends how you define "safe", I would say no, transfer is to coinbase of a offline wallet. It's on the change tip account since you can't have a bitcoin wallet in your reddit messages ;)

I think this way of advertising for Bitcoin is not the right way, Do you see the Europian central bank advertising for the euro?

That's stupid man, What if someone finds a huge security flaw in the source code of bitcoin. There will be no central bank to give you your money back.. If I we're you only do 50%.

Yeah I can help you out. I worked for a digital strategy company in the Netherlands. User Experience is important to test.

I bought some today. And will buy everyday from now the price is lower than today. I'm able to spend some euros so this discount is fine for me. I truly believe in bitcoin and will hold for the future. You never know what's gonna happen. euros aren't doing well too...
