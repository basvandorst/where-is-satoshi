Look @ his twitter picture its from Ayn Rands atlas shrugged series, Erik is and always has been a sociopath (but a pleasant one).
His only goal in bitcoin since buying satoshidice of fireduck has been his own wealth advancement at the cost of everyone else. A few quick examples of his selfishness:
* Multiple extremely petty attacks on litecoin.  
* Flooding the bitcoin network with spammy transactions and showing 0 interest in addressing the issue as it had no effect on his profits (very Ayn Rand there).  
* Various "stand together brothers in our time of need" posts to attempt to dampen previous crashes (Suddenly he needs the society he shat on because he is in trouble).
That being said, all you need to know when dealing with Erik is he is purely profit motivated but likes to portray himself as some kind of inspirational figure but has 0 interest in the community outside it boosting his own position.
Im not saying this is wrong or bad, sociopaths are often misunderstood, what I am saying is any advice he offers is not for the better good but for his own, it may incidentally help you as well.

Motivated by self interest and profit.
Its the reason he constantly shat on alt coins and its the reason for his latest endeavor

no shit, its been obvious for 3 years now he plans on keeping the money donated.
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:42:50
Its stupidity like this that has made me sit on the bitcoin sidelines since the last great spike.
Glad I dumped my ~800 btc @ $1200 AUD instead of hodling like an idiot.
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:54:28


liquidity of the actual market vs holdings of early adopters is very disproportionate. The result being is we cannot have a stable market until it is much much bigger (10-100 times) or the people holding the vast amount of bitcoins learn restraint shown by the diamond cartel (not going to happen any time soon).
To many people think a spike in BTC price = a reason to invest and hope for a higher value, but the only thing that will increase a token based P2P ledger's value is increased adoption AND usage.
TL;DR I agree with the guy above me.

No it is not neutral but again very impressive mental backflips.
@_date: 2014-10-08 01:14:53
I guess I wasnt very clear in my first post.  
I think 1 issue at present we face is the heavily centralized mining operations and the fact they produce ~30-40 million worth of BTC every day they need to sell to keep their farms on.
Its because of this centralization by selfish players (GHASH.IO) that I feel the block reward no longer serves its purpose well. 
I hope with the update we can expect more pools to become active again and see that block reward be shared around the larger mining community.

I had a fair idea when mtgox had been sitting on a withdrawal that was "just about to be cleared by the AU banks" for 6 weeks and when I kicked up a stink was able to cancel the order instantly and credit my account, I bought bitcoins at a 30% loss and GTFO of mtgox.
Since they were the largest exchange by a magnitude of 10 I couldn't sit on old bitcoins any more and cashed out ~75% of my holdings.
Only a bitter person assumes someone's fortune was due to luck and not skill with no background information :)
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:58:32
good for you :)
Hopefully you made a nice profit, but if not you will still sleep easier.
I hit a point some time back where I had to cash out X at Y else I would hate myself if anything ever happened, glad I did.
Im still holding a reasonable amount, but not to much that I have to worry daily over.
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:47:24
Lmao, at all speach is neutral.
You make grand arguments that ignore all human history. Its hilarious, like watching an "intellectual" racist argue his position.
Note im not saying you are racist, I am stating you have done very impressive mental backflips to defend what seems to be a failing of social norms in your personality. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:00:29


Take that with a grain of salt, Erik is an early adopter who didnt want competition in the crypto market because he was afraid it might threaten his primary investment.

Given centum is latin for 100, we use cents for a 1/100 of a dollar in our currencies and a century is 100 years why not simply call 100 satoshis 1 centoshi (sen-to-shi).
Its then also a nice play on satoshi's name:  
     cen to shi
     sa  to shi

Nice try but im not assuming anything. 
You need to think and not regurgitate a point like a child.
@_date: 2014-10-08 09:10:05
wow they sure were, at the current market price &amp; production of 3600 a day its ~$1.2 mil USD / day.
Still pricey but not as bad as I imagined, especially considering what bitcoin achieves.
Thanks for calling me out on that.

I lost 30% of my value by rebuying coins at a higher (fake price) just to get everything out of mtgox.
Writing was on the wall for me, I got out then posted a warning to this subreddit on my old account.

As a bargin hunter in AU I have yet to find anything online I can buy cheaper with BTC than a regular old CC. At $5 worth its a joke to jump through 2-3 sites just to spend $5.
Im an old bitcoin adopter, I like it a lot and use it occasionally, but this tipping stuff is pure spammy BS if you ask me, it also encourages begging. People do enough inane stuff right now just trying to get upvotes, tipping just makes it worse.
@_date: 2014-10-08 03:02:16
that is an excellent point but to expand on that, what happens when 1 of the mining farms is successful in driving out the other mining farms which is ASICMINER's strategy currently. After that they have no need to sell, they just need to ensure they have enough hash power on standby to overwhelm any new attempts at competition and then all new coins are controlled by 1 company with a nice profit margin.

Sounds good, we are long past a good sized network where we could claim decentralization. The block reward that was used to bootstrap the bitcoin economy is now causing it to become centralized by selfish miners.
I predict 0 resistance.

He is irrelevant, he is simply a forum operator who made a fortune advertising for scammers like BFL with 0 care to how obvious the scams were. The fact he also ran a donation drive then didnt use the funds for anything is simply icing on the cake.
We couldnt have a more irrelevant person tbh, he is a cheeky little scammer who got lucky and Id be careful even giving him that much credit.

When more than 1/4 of a new commodity is held by less than say 1% of the world's population the price will  not climb exponentially,  it will likely go flat as we have seen if we are unable to attract more commerce. 
Let's hope distribution increases as time goes on. 
I am not predicting a fail just  gradual trend downwards in price  as coin ownership is consolidated.
