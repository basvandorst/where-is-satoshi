Holy shit...spell check could have made their scheme 10X more successful...
"The campaign would have been even costlier if the attackers hadn't drawn attention to themselves by simply being careless with their spelling. Hackers misspelled "foundation" in the NGO's name as "fandation"...
If the attackers had had better editors, BB might have been out $1 billion..."
And a cybersecurity researcher was abducted: 
then he was found and the details get murky: 
Attention hackers...I am pretty good at spelling, and I don't feel bad about routing stolen money, ie freshly minted money, away from institutions that rob everyone everyday by printing more...please consult me to spellcheck your SWIFT orders next time...I would only charge 1%, and you'd have an extra $849,000,000.

More hackers are coming.  
2FA up and don't download anything...this is a new era of cybercrime...but at least they're targeting the bankers this time because the people have no money left to steal...the bankers took it all.

"more attacks could surface as SWIFT's banking clients look to see if their SWIFT access has been compromised"
This...they are likely using email and website phishing and trojans to gain entry, then running amok once in.
Once again, Bitcoin user unaffected.

Non-astute move?  He offered the same deal months later!  It marked the first transaction where we could peg the price to a US dollar value...that started the sequence of events that has led until now...using it to BUY something back then was absolutely the most astute thing anyone could do with it...prove the trust in a trust network.  Anyway...I'm certain he had plenty more where that came from, he was mining when it could be done from far less powerful machinery and the reward was 50 btc every ten minutes.

tl;dr:  It's like Sudoku puzzles that dynamically change based on the players.
The long version:
Andreas Antonopoulos uses the analogy of Sudoku puzzles.  People all over the world (or in this case computer processing power) are attempting to win the Bitcoin Sudoku Block challenge faster than their peers.  Solving the puzzle fastest wins the block reward, which consists of freshly generated "coins" plus the transaction fees from network use.  The puzzle gets increasingly complex based on how quickly the puzzle was solved...think Sudoku with extra rows and columns.  The target length of time for solving those puzzles (blocks) is every ten minutes.  If the puzzle is solved faster, it adds columns and rows, if the puzzle takes longer than ten minutes, it subtracts them.
Everyone has a shot at winning the puzzle fastest, which is the lottery aspect...even a minuscule amount of processing power could theoretically win, but as the complexity grows astronomically, it is less and less likely, which is why most miners nowadays "pool" their resources (processing power) together in an attempt to win the reward as a group, then split up the winnings based on how much each "worker" (computer) had contributed.  There are more and more instances though, of miners with insignificant computing power throwing caution to the wind and solo mining, attempting to win the entire reward of one block for themselves, even with the math overwhelmingly not in their favor, much like a traditional lottery.
While the hardware has cycled from cpu to fpga to gpu, and finally now to ASIC's, what they all do is essentially try to solve the sudoku faster, the ASIC or Application Specific Integrated Circuit is now designed to do nothing but this specific computation, and they are now in the process of refining those chips often, squeezing out ever increasing "hashpower".  Hashing is essentially the math problem the computers do to solve the sudoku challenge.  The more hashpower, the higher your chances of solving the block.
Bitcoin is hard-coded with 21 million bitcoins available for mining at a very constant rate of every ten minutes, some of the coins are distributed.  Every four years the number of coins created in a block reward is cut in half.  We started at 50 coins per block and this year some time mid July we will experience our second halving, bringing us to 12.5 bitcoins per block, which effectively makes bitcoins 4X as hard to get, compared to their starting point where people could earn blocks with their laptop cpu...something miners consider a distant dream despite it only being 8 years ago that it all started on a dusty little crypto messaging board.
After the initial distribution of 21 Million coins...the network will pay for itself with fees generated by the network being used rather than new coins, which is why the coins can currently be divided with by up to 8 decimal points (with the potential of adding more decimal points in the future as deemed necessary).  Thus fractions of bitcoins will be used, rather than whole bitcoins, because if the system survives until ~2140 when all the coins will be minted, the value of an individual bitcoin will be astronomically higher than it is today.

If you know very little about crypto, mining isn't where I'd start.
Start here:
Don't be scared, it's only eight pages.
The point of bitcoin is to create a viable transaction system that doesn't require you trust the person...just the system running it.  Of course this is and should be considered the wild wild west, and you need to be cautious with anyone trying to get you to send them crypto...most are scammers unless you have sought them out...and even some of them are scammers, so heads up.

In 2010 a computer programmer wanted to buy two pizzas for bitcoin (which had no real value at the time), and a guy in London phoned in the order for him paying a little less than $40.00.  He was paid 10,000 Bitcoins.
Today, that would be worth 9.5 Million USD.  While I'd still list it in the High Risk/Growth category...I would absolutely consider it worth some of my investing funds.

Vaping is effectively a technological disruption to the tobacco industry.  Bitcoin is the technological disruption to money.  If any business owner is likely to "get it" early on, its these guys and ride-sharing services.

LibertyX or LBC.  You can buy fractions of bitcoins (they are pretty much infinitely divisible though the current limit is 8 decimal places out...called satoshi's), so volume isn't an issue.  LibertyX red locations are what's up for easy, in-person purchases that are generally cheaper than the BTM's.

Unless you actually know how to use a private key...in which case you're fine. **Pro tip...keep the private key SECRET, use two form authentication when available and offline wallets for large amounts, potentially even multi-signature wallets that provide "Terminator 2" style security and more.  The money of the people will not come without a learning curve, but it's worth learning.

This is reminiscent of going after Napster users rather than Napster itself.  It would be wiser and less resource intensive to make Uber call a spade a spade and get proper licensing for the fleet of drivers working for them.
Please tip your Uber driver...unless you used a very specific setting called UberTaxi, there is no way to automatically tip your driver through your phone app.  Uber has this tipping policy that goes like this, "Don't worry about the tip, we sure as hell don't!"

At Bitstamp, the top was 1163.  That's what you could actually exchange and get a withdrawal for...BTC-E topped at 1095.2; so if you were lucky enough to be on either of those exchanges with bitcoin and you sold that day or right before...you did well.  I was hoping for even greater gains, so I watched a lot of that evaporate as quickly as it had materialized.

How about we decentralize porn instead of making a bunch of rich assholes who degrade women even more rich?  
I would propose a website styled like Chaturbate, free to watch, free to perform, but the performers would make 100% of the bitcoin sent to them (current site owners hate me for saying this).  
The site should be Ad Revenue based for the owner to make money, which shouldn't be too hard if you target the proper ads...perhaps the owner of this site also owns a porn bundle for bitcoin site, etc.
Opensourceporn, do it.

I think accumulating btc now, while only ~14 million exist is the best time to get in.  Once all 21 Million are in play we will have already passed some major hurdles, and likely the price will be exponentially higher, or the whole system will be dead.
But I am also a huge fan of Andreas Antonopoulos' idea about not buying bitcoin with money you need.  Buy bitcoin with money you didn't use buying pizza last week, that you would have spent otherwise on pizza.  
That way it doesn't matter if it gains or flops, at the end you're left holding bitcoin and a smaller waistline.
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:12:02
So to answer that more directly, no.  I would assume the price would be exponentially higher than 1000 for the system to sustain itself.

You're not in the red until you've sold ;)  
You have less purchasing power currently, but that could change in just a few weeks, and then you'll be up on everything you've ever purchased, thus not in the red at all.  Perspective comes from riding the roller coaster a few times...if you have bitcoin...remember it is finite and others want it...boom.
