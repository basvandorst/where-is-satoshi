My bitcoin **is** insured against a mass breach of Coinbase.

Offline certainly has its advantages, but it also carries serious risks -- if you lose your keys the money is **gone**. 
Coinbase offers pretty robust security features -- they claim to hold most of their currency offline for you and that they are fully insured against theft.
As an extra level of security, they offer the option to store your BTC in a "vault" rather than a wallet.  This does two things -- creates a 48 hour delay on any transactions out of the vault (giving you time to notice and cancel fraudulent ones), and requires authentication from as many emails/phone numbers are you care to configure.

Also, I believe you mean FDIC rules?
And, interestingly, enough, FDIC insurance doesn't cover theft.
What does cover theft is the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, implemented by the Federal Reserve as Regulation E.
Edit: Also, OP is in England.

You're not wrong.  I've **just** dipped my toe into the world of bitcoin, and have been **astounded** by the fee structure.
The fact that there are "services" out there the allow you to buy bitcoin with a **10%** transaction fee is crazzzy.  
If we think of it like a stock buy, paying a 10% fee on a 1k buy is like having a $100 trade commission.
Even 1% is "kinda" pricey.  
My super casual observation is that big chunks of the BTC community have convinced themselves that unacceptably high levels of transaction fees are acceptable.

What about Kraken? I'm new  to the crypto currency (2 weeks) and am thinking about hopping off the coinbase boat.

You're correct.

and as of February it was down 25% over three years. Is there any good reason to assume that 290% returns per year are sustainable long term?
If the answer really is yes, than a 10% fee is supremely reasonable.  If the answer is **no**, and that ultimately we expect the volatility of BTC to drop (and move at a rate more like gold), than the fee structure needs to be revisited.
