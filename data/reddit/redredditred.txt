The advantage being, if authenticator output code is captured (key logger, someone behind you etc.) it will be useless.  Mtgox knows the initial 'seed' value and can verfiy a match, and your phone knows the 'seed' value to generate the codes, but it's near impossible to derive the seed from an output due to the crypto involved. If you write down the initial seed value, where you scan the QR thing, you can have as many authenticator apps as you like, I keep a hard copy so if I lose phone can just add them again.

If all the big miners were to stop in the same period, I guess that would leave block discovery very slow until the next difficulty recalculation. What would cause this? The 'Fad' fading would be a gradual thing, I think it would take a coordinated international crackdown.

My vague understanding is,  bitcoins earned as income would be taxed at their current value.  Bitcoins that have raised in value would be taxed as capital gains when you convert them to AUD.  Sounds a bit crazy to record capital gains tax everytime you buy something, so don't know how that will work.
