By the way, anyone find it odd this all happens the day a Bitcoin related story is on the front page of Reddit ?
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:16:18
I remember talking to Bruce and MyBitcoin seems so weird now haha...
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:05:43
Indeed it does.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:12:43
It is still very early on.
@_date: 2015-06-30 03:57:10
I agree.
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:10:54
[Digital Gold](  is the best one re: the history of Bitcoin and the characters in it . Highly recommend it.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:50:34
Bitcoin has been the most thrill filled ride I've ever taken. Been here since 2012 and have never left.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:17:59
Thanks. Shall take a peak.
@_date: 2014-09-14 04:59:29
We do exactly that. We run [BitcoinStarter.com]( which enables everyone to get Bitcoins refunded if the project doesn't reach its Bitcoin goal. We also have anon. pledges where the project can get the BTC directly. Just ask any questions!

I've been getting emails from "Patrick" for the past few weeks here is one example:
"I've been speaking to you about possibly advertising in Bitcoin Journal, The Street &amp; Huffington Post. Today is my final day at Bitcoin Journal and once I'm a reporter for the The Street &amp; Huffington Post I can't place articles anymore.
Same with Wikipedia. If you would like to get into any of these venues then please get in touch with me today.

Thanks Sean for this much needed post. I know there are many charities for things , but maybe we need to set-up a charity that gives out hugs to make people feel better :/
@_date: 2014-10-05 05:20:16


Only thing you got right. Nothing to see here folks.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:35:02
**headline error:** Satoshi
@_date: 2014-04-07 18:54:47
Yes, there is a lot of turmoil in the community so you see less pledges till things sort itself out.
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:23:15
Broken link as in ?
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:04:58

I would pledge 5-10 BTC out the gate for this.

Oh yes I've heard of Keyhotee good point.

You can use [BTCinstant.com](  to buy a card and have funds pushed to your PayPal or Credit Card of choice....
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:45:04
The plot thickens!
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:02:55
I only deal in crypto even if they go up $5,000 it is well worth it ;-)
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:32:20
THis ^^^ . I'm just to tired and lazy to do what he just did lol....
@_date: 2014-06-28 23:09:54
If she has law enforcement i.e. backing her so called "court order" and they saw how "she" went about treating others with threatening letters they might just revoke her court mandated order based on the fact she is just as crazy as her ex-husband. This wouldn't stand in court, as there was no effort on anyone's part to libel this person. "she " needs to blame the person who started it not the victims.
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:13:18
I approve this message :-) 
Good luck Mike. This is much needed in the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:06:52
Bring it to my [Bitcoin Crowdfunding platform]( I've successfully funded many projects! 
@_date: 2014-08-09 14:02:45
So cool to see how far everything has come.
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:09:32
Now somehow its my fault she is part of a scam ? Got this email now:
"I saw you post about me on Reddit (You'll notice its down) because I have a court order protecting my identity from an abusive ex husband,
By positing about me you are in violation of US law and if you think we can't track you down you should think again.
If I ever see another post about me from you I will make sure you pay for it as long as you live."
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:50:33
Hi Sopap,
I've been involved in the Bitcoin Crowdfunding space for awhile with my [platform]( and would love to expand into this world.  We plan on moving all code to GitHub to let people build on top of our platform in April. This might be a good opportunity as we have the users already. Give me a PM when you can!
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:39:23
Thanks for the mention guys!  We just passed our 1 yr anniversary and will make a post very soon. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-26 01:02:18
Thanks! good luck also.

@_date: 2014-08-25 23:25:40
Hey Tyler!
Great to see someone else involved in Bitcoin Crowdfunding ;)  I've been running one the longest running Bitcoin Crowdfunding platforms called [BitcoinStarter.com](  I look forward to seeing what you come up with.  There is def. a lot of room to grow in this area so best of luck to you! and if you have any questions, or If I can help reach out. 
I found this [Guide to Raising Funding Via Bitcoin]( from another Bitcoin related crowdfunding platform. All very interesting!
@_date: 2014-06-24 05:18:57
My [Bitcoin Crowdfunding platform]( can do all this. Let me know how I can help!
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:58:44
HUGE shocker!
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:30:54
Currently working on this and almost done. I'll keep you posted!
@_date: 2014-07-27 01:14:11
so true! you don't even know how true your statement is!  People busy funding crypto IPO scams!
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:21:13
Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:13:43
Tell your friends if they support Bitcoins they need to bring the project over to   :)
@_date: 2014-06-29 21:12:17
The Bitcoins are put in cold storage and only a hot wallet is used for withdraws.  All btc put into user accounts are taken offline until project is funded.
@_date: 2014-05-18 21:36:49
dogecoin is the only crypto that goes down in value 
with each new user!  new users to dogecoin = less value.
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:04:57
Moarrr Moarrr!
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:31:33
There is one but I don't know the name and will update this post once I find it :)
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:14:41
Thanks for the mention BitPieces!
I do think services like BitPieces and BitcoinStarter need something like Colored coins and CoinPrism! it only enhances the eco-system we all in live in so please support these services going forward! 
Go Bitcoin crowdfunding!
edit: btw do you have twitter? Like to add you.

@_date: 2014-06-23 20:53:35


I was just kidding! I won't be making coins no. The problem is CounteryParty is just as confusing to newbies as Bitcoin is. You've just compounded the problem two-fold!
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:55:33
Yes, I have thought of ( and still might do ) a wikipedia type funding drive for the site as there is a lot I want to do but can't. Ironic isn't it ?  The reason I held back from "raising funds" for my own site is because it would seem strange that a crowdfunding site couldn't even get its own funding so decided to go the traditional route and earn the meager profits each project makes.
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:40:08
ya waiting for mine also :) 
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:49:10
Proof of Steak ? :)
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:56:50
There was nothing that was shown to be a doxxing of any sort. All the information that was posted is already publicly available. This is what I told "her" in my email response back.  If "she" isn't part of this scam then she should be worried someone is using her name and e-mail address as part of the scam.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:55:47
@_date: 2014-05-21 16:06:57
lol you can't make this up!
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:04:48
So clearly you can't control what they do with the funds after-the-fact .There can be vetting prior to the funding and of course the funds don't go straight to their pockets till it is funded ( we are sort of an escrow ) . We try our best to find quality projects which is our key problem at the moment with most people just assuming if they post a project they don't have to do any marketing for it.  If the project is serious they do tend to get funding. Good question!
@_date: 2014-06-20 19:36:47
Hi Thanks for mentioning our [Bitcoin Crowdfunding platform](  You are correct, we don't have much in the way of traffic at the moment, but we make it up with the fact we have users who are already interested in pledging Bitcoins. What we've seen people do in the past ( to accomodate fiat crowdfunding) is do both a KickStarter/Indiegogo AND BitcoinStarter campaigns simultaneously. Obviously, BitcoinStarter would handle the Bitcoin side of things.  Let me know how we can be of service to this great idea!  feel free to email me bitcoinstarter Thanks and have a great weekend!


@_date: 2014-03-07 06:41:04
haha good way to describe it.
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:23:54
~~Project is currently in "editing mode" so you might not see it. Will be back up shortly!~~
back up!
Amount expanded you can still fund it!
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:56:35
Sending you a PM. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:53:48
My apologies I should have known better :P I've talked to Jason before.

If you do decide to do this feel free to use my crowd funding platform :
We can market it good.
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:38:06
You should post the evidence like the guy above. Ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-08-29 15:32:49
So it begins.
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:38:29
I just sent them a message to add Bitcoin to their site :)
@_date: 2014-12-26 20:51:27
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:09:58
The reason I said Bitcoins?  is because she knows what Bitcoins are. I thought maybe she was talking about some alt-coin.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:26:48
Never thought I would see this day....
@_date: 2014-06-25 18:28:08
I'll just leave this [here]( .
@_date: 2014-07-27 00:25:09
haha ya figured that was the case!
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:58:52
She is know threatening me because "she" has a court order against her abusive ex-husband. Go figure!
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:29:34
Ah, no worries just a lot of traffic driven there so figured I would check in to see what was being said and needless to say didn't expect that!
@_date: 2014-06-21 00:48:46
+1 lol ;-)
@_date: 2014-05-19 01:55:59
Yes, my point exactly lol 
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:06:16
I'm the owner of [BitcoinStarter.com](  and I'm barely living on keeping the site up and going.  I don't have a salary. I wish I could raise $720,000 in 18 hours! 
@_date: 2014-02-15 22:13:37
Welcome sir!
@_date: 2014-06-29 02:51:41
So true. Like how would anyone know? You can't break the law if you don't know the person has a court order. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:36:20
I like what you are thinking. I'm all about [crowdfunding]( but your idea is pretty sounds for companies trying to get off the ground. Let me know how I can help you!
@_date: 2014-06-04 00:03:07
You are spot on with your analysis of where technology sits on top of protocol.  Crytpo-tokens will power equity based crowdfunding it is coming sooner then later.
@_date: 2014-08-02 21:18:47
Thanks! it was a brilliant project and glad it reached its goal amount. There is nothing better then seeing a project get off the ground with Bitcoins!
@_date: 2014-05-21 17:41:15

This part is pretty cool:

* We pay all our workers in BTC.
* We will always accept BTC for any of our services.
* Running a full node at the office to give back to the bitcoin network.

@_date: 2014-06-23 20:51:55
That is the  problem with the site, is people think they can just put up any idea and it will fund itself. It doesn't work that way.
@_date: 2014-05-21 05:18:09
To the moon!
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:08:38
Crowdfund it :)
Then  have the reward tiers be QR codes as part of the logo so people get a nice kick-back!
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:46:45
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:20:21
It was bitstarter and  have the twitter bitstarter but adding Bitcoin to it made sense. Also, I would pledge 5-10 BTC to this.
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:05:07
Haha thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-07-15 20:17:11
Should have put this up on [BitcoinStarter.com](
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:33:59
Not to toot my own horn but my [Bitcoin Crowdfunding platform]( is the only Bitcoin donation platform with successfully [funded projects]( So not all fund raising projects are scams or frauds.
@_date: 2014-01-05 07:16:36
Cool . Great to see this.
@_date: 2014-08-29 15:33:18
I had no idea there is a degree in Blockchain.
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:44:56
Sweet added! :)
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:23:46
I suppose I should pass this forward to the owner? ;-) 
btw: in 2014 I'm introducing the first ever Crowdfunding Tipbot for Reddit so you can do this in a more formal way haha...
@_date: 2014-10-05 06:24:56
Check out twitter account : 
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:19:02
@_date: 2014-11-05 01:07:26
I run a [Bitcoin Crowdfunding platform]( and had started building something like you are saying a few months ago till things got switched up with the tipbot.  This idea is sound and a good idea. Be cool to discuss this in a PM! so hit me up :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:52:49
Hi, yes clearly this is an issue. There are some things we are working on to solve this of course. We've had [funding the past]( plus Mt. Gox falling apart and just uncertainty with crypto in general isn't helping! Things will come back. We have some things lined up like I said ( introducing dogecoin, opening this up to github) but I do appreciate the question thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:04:33
Same here haha :D 
I see two stores online though :/
**edit:** can't get into either .
@_date: 2014-07-10 18:40:00
a bukkake of counterparties?
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:42:53
On my [Bitcoin Crowdfunding platform]( we easily can push all the coins back to people's accounts. There is no final sale as mentioned above by using Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:56:49
Hopefully it translates to To the Moon!
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:10:37

Let me know how if my [Bitcoin Crowdfunding]( platform can help also.  Already have 1,000 + user base ready to pledge Bitcoins to such a cause. Drop me a PM! Thanks.
Also, we are eliminating any fee ( just haven't changed it ) and going to a pay-it-forward method.
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:28:12
We really do take things for granted.
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:28:56


Umm ... [BitcoinStarter.com]( does?
I wonder if I should just create BitcoinStarter coins myself lol
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:02:51
Lol...thats what I'm wondering could you use this to do that?
@_date: 2014-06-23 23:14:35
Interesting take. So its a bounty-container-fee. I can only take a % from the pot ( If I were to do this I would only take 1 percent) and that is applied to keeping the site running for the community plus encourages projects as such. I think you have a brillant idea there! :)
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:35:33
They allow merchants to accept  multiple coins.
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:55:43
Good point. Law enforcement wouldn't be backing someone threatening violence. I suppose the scam continues. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 16:37:03
Thanks for the mention!  We do have an active [Twitter Account]( along w/ a few thousand users ready to pledge on a project like this. We are looking for one BIG project to put [Bitcoin Crowdfunding]( on the map!

True. We keep all funds in cold storage like most BTC related companies do.

From looking at who pledged via email addresses doesn't seem to be a self-funded entry.

It is a fair statement to make.
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:21:14
Sure isn't looking like that was the case. Which leads me to wonder if the whole 'bitstamp' compromise was to double-check the books to hide this.

Joe Lewis, a billionaire foreign-exchange trader who teamed up with hedge-fund manager George Soros in 1992 to bet against the Bank of England, is the latest high-profile financier to throw his weight behind the virtual currency called bitcoin.
Mr. Lewis leads the Phoenix Fund, a Zurich-based private-equity fund that on Tuesday plans to invest $200 million in Avalon, a company that makes computer servers aimed at creating bitcoins, according to people familiar with the situation.
Bitcoin is a virtual currency that exists online and isn't backed by any government or central bank. Bitcoins were invented in 2008 by a computer programmer who goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who describes it as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.
Joe Lewis's Phoenix Fund is investing in a bitcoin company.
The Phoenix Fund's investment in Avalon reflects the growing popularity of virtual currencies, which are also coming under scrutiny from regulators. Other bitcoin enthusiasts include Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are best known for their role in the creation of Facebook Inc. FB +1.50% They have proposed an exchange-traded fund that is tied to bitcoins.
Bitcoins are created through a process called mining, in which computers solve complex mathematical algorithms to earn the bitcoins. The total number of bitcoins that can be mined is limited to 21 million. There are now about 11.5 million bitcoins in circulation, according to Blockchain, a website that monitors bitcoin transactions.
The Phoenix deal will also involve Taiwanese microchip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., 2330.TW 0.00% which is set to supply the state-of-the-art microchips that will power the hardware.
The Phoenix Fund was set up this year to invest in bitcoin mining-hardware companies. It looked at several of Avalon's rivals in the sector, including Butterfly Labs and KnCMiner but decided against investing, according to a person familiar with the private-equity firm's strategy.
Investors in the Phoenix Fund, which includes a small number of individuals who made their fortunes in currency trading, believe that the currency will become more stable and popular if more parties are involved in the mining process, this person said.
Mr. Lewis moved into currency trading in the 1980s and 1990s. In September 1992, Mr. Lewis teamed up with Mr. Soros to bet on sterling crashing out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, an event that was later named "Black Wednesday." Mr. Lewis didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Lewis had big losses investing in U.S. brokerage firm Bear Stearns Cos, in which he began amassing a stake during 2007, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.
Mr. Lewis is the main investor in an unlisted company called Tavistock Group, which has investments in more than 200 companies across the globe.
Tavistock Group includes ENIC Group, which has a Bahamas-registered subsidiary called ENIC International Ltd., through which Mr. Lewis owns 85% of the shares in U.K. soccer club Tottenham Hotspur.
The Phoenix Fund is independent of Tavistock.
The bitcoin deal was put together by Andrew Laurus, a former government-bonds salesman at Lehman Brothers who is also an investor in the fund. Avalon was set up by Yifu Guo, a pioneer in the bitcoin-mining industry. He was part of the team that developed the first ASIC bitcoin mining hardware. ASIC stands for application-specific integrated circuit, a type of custom-designed microchip. Mr. Guo couldn't be reached for comment.
Separately, Coinflash, a company that planned to set up kiosks for bitcoin enthusiasts to buy the virtual currency, is shutting down before it even opened its doors. "Due to an unforeseen change in our personal circumstances, we've made the difficult decision to suspend Coinflash's services indefinitely," the San Diego-based company said in an email statement.
Coinflash was established earlier this year and had planned to open the bitcoin kiosks in California and New York this summer.
As part of the deal, Avalon will gain access to TSMC microchips based on 20-nanometer processes, which are much faster than other chips. TSMC recently won a contract to supply chips to Apple. The increased processing power should give Avalon an edge in solving the algorithms that control the supply of bitcoins.

Beautiful site!
Going to send you a PM.
@_date: 2013-09-25 20:52:07
Will look into this *option* the reason we have it you sign-up is to keep projects honest in what they are offering but will give this option a look.
@_date: 2013-08-18 01:35:19
Ya, there is no service like that for fear of chargebacks.

Hello Dacoinminster,
Owner of [BitcoinStarter.com]( here.
I love to see new initiatives around Bitcoin and the Bitcoin protocol. I believe you would be doing more of equity-stake version of crowdfunding would this be correct?  The only reason why you would have "coins" on a new protocol layer is so people know they have "ownership" and can be "paid out" in some form hence the question of equity-stake crowdfunding.
We currently do these two things mentioned below:
* Like Kickstarter, if enough funds aren't raised, everybody gets their bitcoins back
* The real identities of myself and any co-founders are known - no anonymous people who might disappear.
If you have any questions regarding my platform or if I can help out in anyway get in touch with me!
P.S 
I should have mentioned we'll be adding a feature shortly where people can crowdfund directly through the [BitcoinTip Bot]( A lot of exciting things ahead for sure!
@_date: 2013-06-29 01:22:55
Hey how is your project going? :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:06:02

@_date: 2013-12-20 02:18:27
Hello, I run a [Bitcoin Crowdfunding platform]( and I always have a million bitcoin ideas running around my head. I live &amp; breath it.  One thing I was thinking is a way to keep track of when I bought into a particular crypto currency I can never remember if I bought BTC at $147.50 vs. $212 but better yet even the smaller amounts in alt-coins .29 cents vs. $1.25. So would show how much I purchased at , what the current value is now and how much it's gone up &amp; down , % change etc, etc.,... Then if I wanted to buy back in rinse and repeat. If there was a way to sort this out this would be very helpful to me. Thanks for bringing yourself to this community!
As it stands right now I just write down in pencil but I loose my paper all-the time! ;)
P.S  Of course I can help fund it ;-)

BitInstant has always been a good Bitcoin Company. Give them a little breathing room folks.
@_date: 2013-09-16 01:26:33
I don't see why it wouldn't. Do you have a pretty good following on say, twitter , F.B ? Also, allow for a few weeks for it also as the site is still gaining traction.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:29:31
Fair warning for what? The fee is 5 percent what is the warning for? No, the community spoke up and said what they are willing to pay for such a service, we got it wrong and we have no problem being wrong. Clearly, we aren't in it for the money if we are going to shave it in half.
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:37:45
Not by CoinDesk. Nice try though! :)
@_date: 2013-07-30 18:18:56
 If you read this feel free to drop me a message about wanting put your project on a [Bitcoin Crowdfunding platform](  What I find interesting is one the backers is KickStarters boss [Fred Wilson]( I wonder what the conversation will be like around it ?  Either way, I'll leave the Bitcoin Crowdfunding light on for you.... ;-)

There we go! Thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:48:03
Yes, after further thinking about it automated transaction log entry via exchange API's would be nice.  I prefer either web-based or desktop one. I'm just sick of not knowing where I came in at , if I'm up or down etc.,etc.

@_date: 2013-07-13 19:49:05
Cool deal! Looks good on KickStarter  ;-)
Yes, I had thought about creating some sort of export/import feature where people can transpose there KickStarter project right into BitcoinStarter itself. Then with a simple verification it puts it up. This is something I'll def. be looking into this aspect. One of the many items on the list! 
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:57:49
haha oops! long day today waive! 
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:51:03
You could be right. Thing is why wouldn't a family member , friend not want to help out and get something back? Ok, so maybe I'm to optimistic but like you said maybe not allowing referrals to generate a profit might solve it.
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:40:41
Pretty cool stuff you got there!
@_date: 2013-08-10 20:33:18
Here is the link to their video:
In a lot of ways BitcoinStarter as a platform is being used as a place for people/investors to discover new projects and take it from there which I personally am fine with. Whatever betters the whole community I'm all for.
Personally, and yes I'm bias, I think its an awesome project.

I'll give it a go. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-07-12 22:41:25
I see what you are saying if you fail in either one it effects it all. I think you can put in your description that you will fulfill rewards if your KickStarter reaches its funding as allowing Bitcoin pledges is just an extra bonus at this time and link your KickStarter project to it. Sort of transposing it in a way. I see no reason why that wouldn't work.  Keep mind all Bitcoins can be returned regardless. Good idea.
@_date: 2013-07-14 01:26:54
Time is Money ? lol ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:52:59
We will be working on vetting projects further and attaching them to real-world properties but in all reality the market-place decides ;-) Nobody, will pledge if they feel the same way as you which they probably do. Unless someone out there knows their project first hand.  For example, DEFCAD.com is interested so we have some things to go by for them obviously. I hear what you are saying we'll fine-tune it.
edit: we are implementing a follow-up method with each new creator now.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:22:09
I don't there is any. I checked all my bookmarks no go.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:27:42
I'll see what we can do for sure. Version 2 would be great open source and spread the Bitcoin community love.

It shouldn't matter what your pledge is being spent for if you are receiving the reward you want. It's irrelevant how the money is spent to make projects successful.

Yes, we'll download a .csv file of pledgers addresses along with their contributed amount and send you upon successful completed project. 
We are adding in a way for you to see all the amounts of pledges people make to your project also.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:23:31
Listen2.io I think was one and my friend is working on it at btcradio.com.
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:20:57
Yes, this is correct also. We only keep funds for a short amount of time ( or duration of the project ) so the risks are very minimal. Also, you could always pledge at the last minute also if you don't want to keep funds on the site.
@_date: 2013-09-14 18:14:48
If we can help with any fundraising let me know  .

Yes, the project creator wanted to extend it another 3 days as the first pledge came in today. Sorry for the mix up!
@_date: 2013-07-28 22:40:30
Ya, not sure why you are getting downvoted. You have a right to explain why civil disobedience isn't your way of doing things and that is perfectly fine. I'm also double checking with the creator of the project regarding the  dispute between Shield Mutual and will have an update shortly.

Hi Razorbites,
I know the guys over at bitcoinprbuzz.com. Blake, is a good guy and he is good at what he does. We extended his campaign by 2 weeks because we have started our own advertising for the website. Thanks for posting this!
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:21:23
Hey thanks! No problem. We can chat it up on google at some point. Really interested to hear more about this project it seems really good. Not sure what the 502 error would have been but I'm sure everything is fixed just let me know at ( bitcoinstarter Ah, I've been meaning to head over to the wiki thanks for the heads up! be in touch for sure.
@_date: 2013-09-27 00:41:36
It isn't my site but I know the person who runs it what site is it and I'll figure out what happened.
@_date: 2013-10-16 05:32:31
My guess is Mt.Gox is financially broke.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:51:58
We agree and thanks. There is a bigger goal here like building a user base and promoting Bitcoin. We want to be just as passionate about what projects are posted on our site as the project creator is.

Drop a few on some Bitcoin related projects:  :)
@_date: 2013-06-10 18:38:26
Part of the reason we "aren't known" is the type of projects we possibly might try to fund i.e 3D Gun Printing . As with any site , you risk them running off with your money but we have no intentions of going anywhere. My partner is will embedded in the community and runs a major Bitcoin service. We've been around over a year with various re-designs but always have been part of the community. If you are concerned just PM us we'll tell us who we are no problem.

Nah, I say go for it. As long as your willing to hold on to it.
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:20:06
ya to bad! we are going to be putting it "live" on BitcoinStarter shortly for BTC.
@_date: 2013-09-10 00:01:17
This is a really a good project and highly recommend people pledge toward it!
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:17:02
Regarding M of N signatures. We don't use it and don't plan on it yet...
currently we use offline wallet to securely store the funds... of course potentially vulnerable if our computer is infested with trojans and our keys are stolen when we decide to spend from offline wallet.

ZoidBerg? haha... BTCstarter? haha  
   ;-)
@_date: 2013-10-15 21:51:41
It's just starting. I say another 6 months and we'll see the scale start to tip toward mainstream.....
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:51:06
I'll ~~wave~~ waive the fee if you want to bring it over to my [Bitcoin Crowdfunding Platform](  :)  Already have 1,000 users ready to pledge toward projects! 
@_date: 2013-09-15 04:04:12
So you want to know "what works" it comes down to put some effort into it. I literally was just telling someone all the successful projects we've had so far ALL had people actively getting it in front of people. Of course, you have to have a decent project people would want to pledge to. But you bring up a good question. What are you thinking ?
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:28:30
Thanks! We already in the works on a cool API and reddit stay tune! ;-) 
@_date: 2013-09-20 00:54:08
Nice to see this :)
@_date: 2013-09-05 23:18:14
I saw this post here ( founder of BitcoinStarter here) . 
Here are some of my comments back and thanks for the feedback!


is orders of magnitude higher than those who have either heard of bitcoin or actually have any. Crowdfunding 
is all about converting: capture somebody's attention with your pitch and make them take out their wallet. 
The more barriers you put up, such as having to learn about bitcoin, buy some, make a transaction, the fewer 
people will donate.
Clearly, there are a great magnitude of people who have access to credit cards then Bitcoins this is a given, however, this shouldn't be a bar raiser for people who do have Bitcoin not participate in funding a project in Bitcoins. If you are under the thinking that Bitcoins will *someday* become mainstream then you have to anticipate it as such.


As Bitpay has solved volatility so has BitcoinStarter. You can choose to have the amount of Bitcoins needed for the project, to adjust to current market value so you are never left with "less" in value as the amount of Bitcoins goes up and down according to price. It is no different then how Bitpay does it. At the end of the day your Bitcoins are worth as much as your project needed.  As a pledger you come in at the same value.


You pay taxes in anyway you would if you were to sell Bitcoins. This issue isn't the exception to Bitcoin crowdfunding.


Clearly you can find out who we are upon contacting us. There is nothing to hide. The reason it isn't visiable on the site is *some* projects could be controversial as stated. We are also setting up a way where bigger projects 100,000$ or more can still register this amount but have full control of funds elsewhere giving a since of peace that the BTC doesn't sit on our site and are risk of hacking. 
**Tl;dr** Nobody should be blocking *anything*  project or ways of funding a project the way Paypal has. Bitcoin solves this.
All good feedback thanks!

Be nice if knew of Bitcoin and Bitcoin [Crowdfunding]( If the community helps someone like this get on the site it would really help spread Bitcoins. Just an idea.

Did you get my PM NerdfighterSean ;-)

sweet thanks man! PM'd you! :)
Review: Great site!  Def. going to use them going forward easy to use and great customer service. Thanks guys!
This is without the tip given also I would use them anyways!
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:34:27
Ok :)
@_date: 2013-07-12 21:51:37
Thanks for the questions!


I would suggest you keep what you have going on KickStarter then do a Bitcoin crowdfunding projects to fill in any gaps in funding. 


Will the money/BTC you ask in Bitcoins would have to take in consideration rewards regardless of what your main KickStarter does. Meaning, if you reach your goal on our site you would still be doing rewards for pledgers regardless.


I'm not following this part. I suppose it all depends on what you want to do with your project on our platform.


Our system is all-or-nothing. If you don't reach it everyone gets their bitcoins back.  All good questions! Help me better understand if need be!
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:23:49
Another good group ^^ .
@_date: 2013-03-05 16:32:14
Will use this service also. Found you on BitcoinLister.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:32:11
@_date: 2013-06-02 01:38:15
Any chance you are interested in doing a Bitcoin Crowdfunding campaign?
Reach out to us bitcoinstarter or PM us if you can't get things to work with KickStarter as this is what we do. Take the projects they don't want.
@_date: 2013-08-10 05:36:50
I have  a bad feeling this isn't going to end good :/ 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:04:13
So it begins!
@_date: 2013-07-12 23:46:10
You weren't kidding you are up on KickStarter! Congrads for sure ;-) . Let me know what you think because your idea is sound when it comes to parallel projects on both platforms.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:04:16
NanoShip supplies a shipping system that matches the freedom and global nature of the Bitcoin economy.
NanoShip would function similarly to a social network or shopping service, where people can join using anonymous email such as Bitmessage.ch or with Bitmessage itself. They could choose to be a courier, someone who will just use the service to send packages or both.
Couriers would set the prices they would charge to deliver a package a certain distance, based on their costs, which would be displayed on their page along with their courier rating. The rating would let potential shippers get an idea of the reliability of the courier and they would have the ability to communicate to discuss the details.
The addresses are based on GPS technology, and the users choose a point that represents their "address". That point can be anywhere on Earth, or can correlate with their physical address. This system offers greater anonymity and flexibility over addresses based on streets. 
The GPS coordinates are encrypted into a hash, which serves as their physical "address". There would be software within NanoShip that combines that with GPS navigation data to guide the couriers to their destinations, while not transmitting raw GPS data.
If shipping a package, the customer would browse the couriers and although they do not know the exact physical addresses, knowing the general locations of the chosen addresses of the potential couriers would allow the customer to choose a course for the delivery of their package.
When the couriers are chosen and the price is agreed upon, the customer would pay for the shipping and generate a QR code label with the software to be placed on the package. The Bitcoins go into a type of decentralized escrow, and the first courier meets the customer at the customer's chosen GPS-based NanoShip address.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:09:25
There is no good way.

Front page or "hot" tab.
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:07:57
Thanks! I mean if you don't feel like you should "pledge" then don't! Nobody is forcing anyone to pledge. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:59:46
It is the "hivemind" that does this.

No, Problem buddy! ;-)
@_date: 2013-08-02 19:02:36
letstalkbitcoin does.
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:38:10
Yes, ~~we have a 10% fee~~ ....*Fees are now 5% (1% for referrals, 4% for us)* because we plan to spend on advertising your projects, to reward referrals that attract pledgers and to develop new features... to become a referral, just append any url of our site with ?partner=&lt;your bitcoin address&gt;...
Please let us know what you would expect in a fee , as we are here to listen.  Also, this isn't about the money, it's about making each project successful on the platform and showing how Bitcoin, as a crypto-currency, has many utilities. This is the goal.
@_date: 2013-10-11 03:29:56
I have the same thing here strange stuff.
Litecoin is $102 something is wrong with the ticker.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:47:15
I couldn't agree more. We need Bitcoins to spent on different things. My thinking with crowdfunding is unique-one-off items that can only be obtained through crowdfunding ( If someone came up with a transporter) then it would drive Bitcoin into the mainstream quicker. I hope your surgery goes good and keep me in the loop of your world-wide popular open source game project VERY interested.

I see what angle you are coming at it than. So yes a credit might be more wise but might not eliminate it. Good suggestions.

I'm not sure what you want to know? we are doing what everyone else does and that is protect people's Bitcoins. Besides not  even having the service, I have a feeling you'll never be satisfied! ;)

Hi Delelles,
I currently run a [Bitcoin Crowdfunding Platform]( and we offer an [affiliates program]( that rewards people in BTC who get others to pledge towards a Bitcoin related crowdfunding project. Ask me any questions thanks!
@_date: 2013-06-22 01:42:22
ok sounds good thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:56:47
We rejected their project on BitcoinStarter.com and sent an email to the person letting them know as such.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:52:18
I like what you've done!
@_date: 2013-08-02 19:07:04
Joey, really great to hear you are using Bitcoin for your crowdfunding and more encouraging to see it was funded! I do think DIY and [Bitcoin Platforms]( ( I'm the owner ) can change a lot in this area. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:49:33
Great job!
@_date: 2013-06-11 23:57:28
We are looking at this yes. Multisig/escrow is def. something worth looking into.

@_date: 2013-09-15 15:31:12
Good, good :)
How much do you need to raise?  Obviously, having a sample as the "video" in the project would help push it along. I'm sure as long as you keep pushing and we keep pushing it that it can be successful :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:00:46

[PM]( me. The way I can see it the rewards could be the following:
* 1,000 BTC - Small Bungalow on xx amount of space
* 2,000 BTC - Small Bungalow on xx amount of space+ **free food for life!**
* 50,000 BTC - Small Bungalow on xx amount of space + free food for life! + **Captain of the Navy!**
I don't know use your *imagination* and make it happen! I'm in to pledge towards this project ;-)
@_date: 2013-09-25 18:43:28
The Reddit Crowdfunding tipBot coming soon will solve that aspect.
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:10:38
Actually, someone already took it!  r/bitcoinstarter instead I own:
Which by the way we are in the works of using the BitcoinTip Bot to fund projects right through reddit ;-) It's pretty slick so far.
