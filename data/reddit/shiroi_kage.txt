How is the transaction fee determined anyway?
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:19:37
Why is there a cap? All of this talk of it being an exchange medium and then we have a cap?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:20:45
I hear it's better tech anyway.

I mean, that was a ridiculous thing to say obviously, but having a $1 fee on every transaction is still too much for something that's supposed to be a medium of exchanging value.
Best thing would be to implement something that caps above a certain amount, and scales by percentage below it.

If this is to be a viable system of exchanging value, especially for everyday use, it shouldn't push anyone to optimize.

After the recent wave of arrests happening to businessmen and rich people in KSA, they're definitely going to use this to smuggle out their money.

That was a great game.

With this density of phones the network would work fine even with jamming, unless they get into the crowd and jam there.

I think it's more likely that their traffic was compromised through man in the middle attack or simple phishing.

You spelled political action wrong.

I didn't have to do that. I only tied a card and that's it. I think it's different if you want to tie a back account or be a seller though.

Central Iowa. Anywhere around Des Moines is pretty much within reach for me.

Hmmm. Really, I just want to donate to Voat to be honest, and maybe have a little bit more Bitcoin to donate to other causes/entities that don't want to accept other forms of payment for some reason. This whole jumping through hoops is making it a bit difficult.
@_date: 2015-07-06 10:27:28
Wow, you got defensive there really quickly. When did I blame those hoops on Bitcoin? 
I just said that the hoops are putting me off of it. I'm just an end user trying to support a website's endeavor. I want a convenient way of doing it which, because they're sticking with BTC, is turning out to not be as convenient as conventional methods. Whatever the reasons are (I'm aware of them) isn't my point here.
But thanks for your recommendation. It was already suggested to me and I might be able to get what I need there.

I am in the US and I have used PP for those amounts before, and it was fine. Although, I had the account for a while so I might have submitted an at some point.
As for meetups, it is a commitment to go and meet people for what is essentially currency exchange. It's probably where the best deals are, but it's too much hassle if you're not looking to dive head on into BTC (like I'm not) Although if I go there it would be cash cause that would be better for bargaining.

You're leaving out all the controls, the meticulous interrogation, the constant falsification of hypotheses, the repetition, ... etc. Nothing like that is being done here.

On the upside, maybe GPU prices are going to go down a little.

This all depends on the implementation. Right now, everything sucks. If we can have a modular system whereby everything can connect to a central standard (say a PC) and *that* could be what faces the internet, then I would be fine with that because you can secure a PC. However, how do you secure a toaster? How do you secure a fridge? You have to depend on the manufacturer, and that's just going to suck.

Kind of redundant.


In which case the comic showed it really badly since it used ransomware. You own your PC and the data on it, but if you get ransomware you lose all your data. You lost your data not because of manufacturer dependency, but because of poor security measures that allowed the intrusion.
Same in the comic. No matter how much "ownership" you're given of the device, the regular user will not be manually flashing more secure firmware and will depend on the manufacturer to push those updates. When their device breaks, they'll probably replace it or send it to someone to flash a new firmware. Two years after buying the device, it'll not be supported.


I don't know about that. Get all the ownership you want of a device. If the thing is on the internet, it'll need security updates, and chances are that you're not going to be writing the security patches. Manufacturers will have to push those security measures, and there's no getting around it. Even in current software, anything at the level of OS or firmware has to have the intervention of a larger, organizing body to get proper security updates pushed out. See something like Android for an example of that.
