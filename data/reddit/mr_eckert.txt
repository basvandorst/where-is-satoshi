It doesn't matter what Trump says about money printing.  The Fed will do what the Fed wants to do.  They are independent of FEDGOV and not subject to audits.  This gives politicians cover.

Did you not read the link?
"11/ The upcoming IPO is one way of untangling themselves from this situation. However, once public, shareholders will want to know why Bitmain is continuing to divert profits to propping up a failed currency and how they intend to liquidate their massive position in BCash.
12/ The increased scrutiny from public markets and pressure from new shareholders is going to be the last straw.
Bitmain will be forced to abandon its efforts to prop up BCash and focus on the reality of the market"
I agree, if I was thinking of investing in this IPO I would have to ask the question of what business is this company engaged in?   Mining? Hardware? Hedge Fund? Market Maker? AI?  I would demand they dump the bcash and focus on the hardware/mining side of things.  Go play and have fun, but with big money you stick to what you're good at.

Nobody knows, maybe decades?  Today Bitcoin has a $150B market cap, Gold is about $8T.  From a global macro perspective we are tiny.
Plan₿'s stock to flow model predicts a bitcoin market value of $1T sometime after the next halving, so even if that model fits we still have a long way to go.

You need to fund the wallet on your node in order to open payment channels.  iPoopedJustNow can now open up X number of payment channels with the sum total of the channels being 2BTC.

That might have been 4-5mo ago, but this newb just setup a Casa node last week and was making LN purchases the same day within hours.  I think 2 years seems like a long time after my positive user experiences.

Max Kieser is legit when it comes to crypto.  He started talking about Bitcoin when it was like $1 and was telling everyone to buy when it was at $3 in 2011.  I thought the same as you and didn't listen to him back then...
But I agree having Saifedean and Andreas around is a great 1-2 punch for spreading the word and growing peoples understanding of Bitcoin.

I just got my Casa node yesterday.  Setup is simple.  My PC didn't resolve the .local page but it was easy enough to find the Casa on my network.  It took several hours to fully sych with BTC/LN, then you fund your LN wallet and can open up payment channels with others.  I just ordered a tshirt  and the payment went through instantly...like lightning.

No, it's not "locked" in any way more than any other hot wallet.  You can withdraw BTC from your LN wallet and do what you like.  And you can close LN payment channels and have whats leftover in your node wallet.  By "locking in" 2BTC to the LN by not spending/trading the coin and funding channels to other nodes, they would add liquidity to the network allowing other peoples payments to pass through(and pickup tiny fees).
@_date: 2019-09-05 19:28:52
If you have a Casa node you also get 20K sats for connecting it to the app and 10k sats per week if you maintain your "heartbeat" streak.

$300 is the price for the node+software (plug &amp; play), a hardware wallet and the 1yr of keymaster (2of3 multisig).  You don't have to pay any annual fee unless you choose to use keymaster.  IMO it's a solid solution if you're not tech inclined or if you value your free time more than the money.

I think 5yrs is way optimistic.  But on a longer timeline how do CC companies at 2-3%/transaction compete with LN at like .0001%?  Even with the points/miles BS you get with CC transactions you could use LN and give customers cheaper prices up front.  If I was a merchant I'd have a LN node running yesterday.
Lending will continue to exist, but payment processing is about to get way cheaper IMO.

The only issues I had was that the .local address didn't resolve, so I had to login to my router to find the local IP.  And I had to enable port forwarding on 8333 as UPnP didn't work for me.
Beyond that it's been very easy to use, just fund the node wallet with some coin and you can start opening/funding channels.
It has taken a bit of time for some channels to open (up to 30min) and sometimes I've had to reduce the BTC amt for the channel in order to get it to connect, but so far once a channel is connected I've had 100% success in routing instant/nearly free transactions.

Progressives like control, ban this/hate speech-censor that.  It was progressive President FDR who outlawed the hoarding of gold in 1933 and that law stayed into effect until the mid 70's when Ford changed it (after Nixon took the USD off the gold standard).  10 years in prison or a 10K fine(1933 dollars) or both, for owning gold coins/bars.
Bitcoin lets ALL people circumvent controls, even if they wrong-think.  Of course they hate it.
