There needs to be a fantastic, completely seamless, and perhaps physical UX analogous to a physical key. It makes sense, it's technically sound, and people would generally understand the basic concept of a token that you keep safe that protects your property and allows you to use it.
Bam, done.

Currency is not about upside or risk. It is about storing and transferring value safely. Stability is absolutely key to its success.

Tragedy of the commons! Doesn't work that way.

Getting less when they're expensive sounds like a good also -- would you rather have more when they're expensive?

It's simply pointing out that saying something that everyone in a group agrees with wholeheartedly is not a very productive line of discussion. Hence the circle, the jerk, and the disdain thereof.

By that time, UI will be inseparable from code.

I'm not new. We had a 2-week news cycle of "Bitcoin? What's that? Oh people made millions off it? I want in!" that racked up the speculators and caused a bubble, with people wanting bitcoin simply because it was going up in value.
I believe this was a media saturation event, in that no one following the news or social media could possibly have missed it. Everyone who wanted in got in, and some might have stuck it out.
However, the 2-week news cycle ended, the price fluctuated for a while, eventually having a small crash and the week or so of hesitant stability as the market attempted to agree upon a fair value.
This week, I think we're seeing the effects of the unwashed masses having entirely passed over the story, most of them either selling their bitcoin after trying it out and seeing the hesitant and unpredictable market, or just ceasing talking about it whatsoever. The mob mentality is lessening, and thus the irrationality is decreasing, and the value should return to what might be considered "real" for something with as yet very little real-world use as a currency or stable store of value.
For most of the public, and probably most investors who looked at Bitcoin and saw either a bubble or a pyramid scheme or some other scam, this is an "I told you so" moment, which will only contribute to the return to rational valuation. Once we reach a lower stable reality, we can start to build tangible value by continuing the push as a currency. This is all a very positive development for the growth of the currency, since it needs to be trusted and rationally valued to ever be of use for its intended purpose.

You can't really for Bitcoin due to the total lack of restriction by design. But you could envision a digital currency whose value is established by some standard, perhaps mathematically, perhaps based on some common commodity price. Just spitballin here that a currency with a predictable value might be more useful, as opposed to more speculative in nature.

If you're worried, just sell and buy something more stable. Honestly, it's investment, not life; it's not worth losing sleep over. Put your money in something that holds value, and spend your time and energy *creating more tangible value,* the only sure way to acquire more worth.

Ding ding ding! Good answer.

It really is! It means I would be an idiot to spend it, since whatever goods I bought with it will have roughly the same intrinsic value in a month, while the BTC I spent will have gone up in value possibly double or more. I lost value on the trade and should have just kept the currency!
Likewise if BTC is predicted to be lower in value in a month, I'd want to spend it and purchase more stable value holders I can later trade back to preserve my worth.
And worst of all, if I can't predict at all whether it's going up or down, then I would be worrying about the value of my currency instead of the value of my goods or services. I'd be inclined to use a different currency as my value store, since evidently this one isn't useful to store value predictably.
Lack of stability isn't a good thing for a currency. Thus, Bitcoin right now is not a currency, but a speculative investment, and the market won't think of it any differently until it stabilizes—not compared to any given fiat, but simply as a measure of the value of goods and services (eg: until, roughly, 0.1 BTC today buys me a bag of rice, and 0.1 BTC tomorrow buys me a bag of rice, and 0.1 BTC next year buys me a bag of rice). It just so happens that fiat is stable in this regard also, so it's a useful benchmark.
Until then, enjoy your speculation, and let's keep promoting BTC as a useful currency so we can get to stability faster.

Senegal's pretty nice, and safe... lots of white people there for who knows why. So many reasons.

Are you not slightly miffed that the BTC you spent on an item (which presumably stays the same value) would have also gained value? Aren't you actually losing money on the purchase?
Eg: if you had waited just a week longer, you might have made a profit on the Bitcoin and then also purchased the same item.
Even this volatile growth isn't good for a currency...
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:23:06
Yeah, I'm basically like awwwww shit I should have bought more BTC.
Oh well, enjoy what you got, and continue doin what you do. There are a lot of ways to make money, and most of them don't include chancing upon a wild speculative investment with exponential growth.
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:30:08
It's nice to think that way, but really, the true value of BTC is actually the unstable thing. People don't know how to think about it or value it yet, so it's fluctuating wildly compared to our other known measures of value.

This happens. Listen to this, internalize it:

The "party" of baseless speculation may well be over. The story is dead in the media, and the public are losing interest.
The next step is for it to achieve stability and valid use as a legitimate currency. Only then will it start to build value again, and then it will be for real.

Nah, I'd be happy to buy. :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:24:29
Ha, and this is exactly why it will not gain traction as a *currency* until it stabilizes. 
Honestly I think it would almost be better if it were pegged to the dollar or euro to end all this reckless speculation and get on with just using it to trade in a predictable manner.
It is a stock right now, nothing more.
