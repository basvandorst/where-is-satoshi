LOL.  This is never going to work.  There are too many people manipulating it.
The powers that be won't let it work.
@_date: 2018-07-17 07:41:35
Shut the fuck up.  I'm right you're wrong.  Simple.
Also, learn how to use punctuation.
@_date: 2018-07-12 03:59:39
Thank you.  My bad.
@_date: 2018-07-17 07:28:34
Yay.  You own half a bitcoin or less.  You're going to be a billionaire.
The system is going to be made illegal globally.
You YouTube poster kids aren't very bright.
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:33:11
There's definitely no manipulation occurring.  /s
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:36:35
Whatever you say, nobody.
@_date: 2018-07-10 02:58:12
Wow, you're clever.  There are only 7 posts before you about the same fucking thing.
@_date: 2018-07-11 05:16:11
Stop posting these bullshit price goals.
This market is manipulated like a motherfucker and the people responsible read and post these posts here.
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:11:07
This was written by a "contributor."  Pretty much anyone can do that.
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:05:44
I disagree with your analogy.  Some of the brightest people on the planet are working to extend the functionality of the Bitcoin network thereby increasing its value.
@_date: 2018-07-11 05:14:30
This guy is an idiot with absolutely no business speaking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:20:51
Stop posting these Forbes contributor "opinion" articles.
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:35:47
Pro tip: they know.
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:13:39
It will be crashed back down within a week.
@_date: 2018-07-23 09:13:44
Look up what that word means, genius, and re-read the post.
Holy fucking shit people are stupid.
You are YouTube post stupid.
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:43:45
This has only been posted 4 times previously.
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:23:15
Yay.  Another nobody attempting to get website hits.
Go away.
@_date: 2018-07-11 05:10:33
He is going to lose all credibility he has left in ~6 months.
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:47:01
Dude, I have owned BTC before you ever heard of it.
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:43:05
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:27:25
Dude, go away.  You are annoying as fuck.
@_date: 2018-07-17 04:30:42
Dude, your posts suck.  Go away.
@_date: 2018-07-12 08:51:19
Do you have any idea what days destroyed means?  I think you have no idea.
@_date: 2018-07-13 23:41:46
You forgot a word.
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:39:56
Shocker...  The manipulators are brining it back down. 
I hope the investigation puts them all in jail.  :)
@_date: 2018-07-31 08:30:38
How original.   Someone only posted the same damn thing 20 minutes before you.
@_date: 2018-07-12 07:44:05
People who have held for years do not sell.  This noise is just Asians trying to make a buck.
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:10:20
Fuck Gates and his ugly wife.  He stole UI ideas and the mouse from others and has given the most exploited operating system to the world - yet he is one of the wealthiest people on the planet.  His opinion is worth nothing.
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:53:36
Holy fuck.  Stop posting bullshit TA.
You will NEVER be rich due to BTC.  If you were, you wouldn't be posting here with your stupid website to get clicks.
@_date: 2018-07-16 10:17:54
I'll tell you one thing...  I've learned over the past 5 years I either get downvoted about discussing manipulation or I get up voted for this.
btc spiked after my post.
...so, there's that.
Maybe I know more than you.
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:36:53
A panic attack over $150?  OK...
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:55:07


You are not a bright person.
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:46:49
What's wrong?  Google broken?
@_date: 2018-07-23 09:03:36
Yeah.  Because nobody switches accounts for anonymity...
Stop being a parrot, you uneducated fool.
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:49:01
Dude, every time I see a post from you I cringe.  You are fucking annoying, seemingly always here and remind me of that annoying bitcoin Yoda dude.
I said last week it would be crashed back down and was downvoted to hell.
Edit:  Evidence?  Are you an idiot?  You need to provide ID to use an exchange.
@_date: 2018-07-12 07:25:54
Yayyy.   Now "traders" dump it again.
It's people in law enforcement in large part who are responsible for all of this bullshit.
Let's investigate them!!
@_date: 2018-07-19 05:19:33
2 things:
1:  When has he ever been considered the "king of crypto"?
2:  He looks like he's aged 20 years in the past 2
@_date: 2018-07-23 11:38:53
This is Roger Ver's scam site.  Downvote.
@_date: 2018-07-16 10:08:18
I had no idea certain words are magical.
@_date: 2018-07-11 05:22:09
That's exactly how it works here, genius.  He's plastering his face all over various media sites making claims.
There are many many people who have no idea what is going on and many who do keep a watch on things.
@_date: 2018-07-17 07:34:39
Praise you?
Kiss my ass.
Holy fuck people here are crazy.
You will NEVER be wealthy due to bitcoin.  EVER.  EVER! 
@_date: 2018-07-29 07:06:06
This is a copy paste of this article:  
It was already posted below.  Douche.

Edit:  I'm never selling even if it goes to zero so blow me.
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:39:02
Holy fuck you need a kick in the nuts.  Go do something else.
All you seem to do is post here.  You will NEVER be wealthy as a result of your half a bitcoin - even if things work out.
@_date: 2018-07-12 06:38:28
Not bankers jailed yet for multi-billion dollar fraud...
@_date: 2018-07-10 08:45:38
There's a relatively new message at the bottom of the page:
"By entering TPB you agree to XMR being mined using your CPU. If you don't agree please leave now or install an adBlocker"

Ignoring the fact that he is known to be clueless about tech (and clearly bitcoin), his quote, 
"You’re just hoping the next guy pays more,” said Buffett." bothers me.
How is this different from a stock?  People purchase stock in the hope that the company performs and the value increases so that it can be sold to someone else for a profit.  Maybe there will be buy backs, sure, but it's still largely the same damn thing.
That's what he has fucking done his entire life...
Sure there is a ton of speculation in bitcoin however, a great deal of that speculation centers around the value that the Bitcoin network will deliver as it grows and gains new functionality.
@_date: 2018-07-19 04:34:49
Fuck this ass clown.
