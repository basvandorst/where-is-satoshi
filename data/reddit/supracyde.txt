Something very similar happened to me a little over a year ago.  I wrote about it a bit here: 
I'd advise you to tell your bank to block any future transactions from coinbase, as they will very likely keep trying to take those funds.  In my case it was closer to 70 BTC that was stolen, 20 of which I had actually purchased, and 50 that the thief had purchased with instant purchase.  It was less than $5k at the time, but my coinbase account still shows a high negative balance in bitcoin.

Sorry for the late reply, I just noticed this.  I am curious to know whether you've experienced something similar to what I posted.  I'm concerned because I still periodically get emails from coinbase asking for payment, and my account is still active unlike some others who were immediately banned or deactivated.  Mostly I'm worried about litigation in the future.  It's difficult to find anyone not in love with coinbase, so do you happen have any insight?

Above where it spits out your password, there's a url that says "Login Link."  Click that, put in your password, and you're in your account.

I personally would be willing to work for a small commission based on whatever is found, meaning if we were to get access to any bitcoin, I'd take a percentage of that, and if not, I wouldn't get anything.  I'm sure others would be willing to do so as well.
If you're located in the Atlanta area, I'd be open to discussing this further, just send a PM.  Otherwise, put that offer out there and you'll likely find someone local willing to help.

All ports at that address appear closed now.  Too much scanning I guess.

I think it was something like a year ago, but someone gained access to my gmail account after (I think) hacking some gambling site that I signed up for and stupidly used the same password on.  They then used their access to my gmail account to reset my coinbase information and purchase and withdraw 50 btc.  
I too had 2fa, which left me stumped for a while.  What lead me to figure out what had happened is that the hacker used an option on coinbase to declare that the 2fa device had been lost and instead send a OTP via sms, so I had a bunch of text messages from coinbase in the morning.  Now, the hacker was able to take advantage of this because at the time, I used google voice for nearly all bitcoin related activity, so all sms's and voicemails were readily accessible from my gmail account as well as my cell phone.
So I basically made the perfect combination of mistakes for a hacker to take advantage of and unfortunatley can't use coinbase anymore because of it.  I'm not saying the same thing happened here, but persistence and intelligence can certainly lead to 2FA being defeated.

It's a pgp key created today claiming to belong to satoshin  It doesn't appear to have been used to sign anything that's been made publicly available.
It doesn't mean anything other than that.

Go here: 
Fill out the information, under wallet identifier write something like "Unknown."  Explain your situation and they'll help if it's a blockchain mnemonic.

It's ransomware, meaning it locks/encrypts components of your computer until you pay bitcoin to get the unlock key.
Encrypted PE is: 
Key is 174, I believe.  Not sure how the PE is encrypted and I don't have time to analyze further.

Complete successful transactions, complete the account verification process, and be patient.  See here:

I like Gemini, but I wouldn't praise their customer support.  I emailed them on 17 April and they never responded until I sent a follow up earlier today.  Even then, I only got an automated response with a ticket number.
Still, withdrawals and deposits are fast and the exchange feels nice to use.  My CS issues are administrative.

It's a good idea and I think it'd be fun, but there are some issues regarding fairness.
Say I'm running this game, and I see you bet a relatively large amount on some country to win.  What would stop me from tampering with the game to prevent the country you're betting on to lose?
I don't play much Civ, but if there's a way to save the initial state of a game and have it always play out the same way, then this may work, otherwise the game itself doesn't provide for a way to do this in a fair way.  That's not to say it can't be done, but if someone were to create this game in a fair way, it'd likely take some significant reverse engineering.

Yep, I think the same.  I mean, a lot of it really does have to come down to trust for a game like this.  I don't think a gaming site that had a game like this would cheat, it's stupid to cheat, the math already will work in their favor if they set the odds appropriately, but the fact that it's possible will make people cautious or simply avoid the game.  You have to remember, maybe 90% of people in the bitcoin community don't understand how games are able to prove they're fair, but the people with backgrounds in programming, math, and cryptography who vouch for the validity of provably fair schemes is enough.
Another possibility would be to look in to open source games that might be fun to stream.  FreeCiv, to stay in genre, though that might not be as fun to watch as Civ5, at least you could more easily implement some form of provably fair functionality.  Then again, the current streams are popular enough, the mathematical guarantee that comes with a provably fair scheme might not be necessary.  There are currently bitcoin gaming sites that don't implement them that are successful after all.  Someone would just have to try it.  I'd be interested in seeing how successful something like this would be and if it brings in more people to the community.

The context of that quote needs to be understood.  0.01 BTC then was worth 6 hundredths of a penny.  Today it's worth almost $30.  No rational person would consider a transaction equivalent to $30 a "very small micropayment."  He was referring to actual micropayments like advertising schemes in which a person is paid fractions of a penny per impression.
Additionally, he goes on to say:


He said that 7 years ago, and his predictions are accurate.

I contacted them on April 17 to change the email address associated with my account.  I contacted them again on May 4th.  On May 8th they answered me, gave instructions which I followed, yet the email address associated with my account is still not changed, over 2 months later.
I still use Gemini, but their inability to complete something simple makes me question their competence in other aspects of running an exchange.
