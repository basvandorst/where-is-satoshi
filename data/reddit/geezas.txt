It's a peer-to-peer protocol (set of rules), so it does not need a central maintainer. You could say participants as a whole maintain it, but really each participant just maintains their own channels and helps route payments for others for a fee. Think of a colony of ants and try answering the same question - who maintains the colony?

If you're constantly receiving way more than you spend then I agree that LN will not help you much. LN is good for "operating budget" - funds that are received and spent. Long-term net difference in funds will require on-chain transactions. LN is not a silver bullet or panacea - it's a complex solution with many constraints, yet it should provide a decent utility IMO. It definitely seems over-hyped sometimes but that's not grounds for outright dismissal.

Closing a channel under normal circumstances (i.e. both parties agree to close and sign) requires only one transaction - it has two outputs, one for each participant (or one output if one side of the channel is depleted).
Opening a channel in a case where only one party funds it certainly requires only one transaction. If both parties fund the channel, then maybe two transactions are needed but I'm not sure about this and I wouldn't be surprised if it can be done with one transaction (because multiple inputs with different signatures in a transaction are typical).

Great question. Smarter people than me say that hashing algos (e.g. SHA-256) are safe from quantum breaking. While it's technically true that someone might at some point find some weakness in the algo (probably would need new mathematical breakthroughs), it's very unlikely if you spend some time to learn how the hashing works. It's a mix of many unrelated transformation functions iterated over many times. This means that finding a weakness in one or few steps will still be useless due to combination of other functions and iterations.
Also, the network will not automatically just die off if a critical weakness is found. Most likely the network would hard-fork to some other scheme that's not known to be broken.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:37:08
Unfortunately this is not correct. You can receive no more than the capacity of the channel. If you spend what you receive, or if you can route other payments in that direction, you can receive that amount again, so you can receive more over time, but only if you also spend or route through that channel.
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:07:14
Good topology will be whatever allows most payments to be routed. The interesting part will be to figure out which potential channels would yield the most utility, hence profit. However that is done, that will be the driving force towards a good topology. If you can figure out some clever algorithms that can analyse the network and suggest best connections to put your money towards, then, sir, you might make some good money in exchange for providing the much needed liquidity.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:09:50
He was asking if LN participant can receive an amount that's bigger than the capacity of their current channels. The answer to that is no, not possible. There being a route to the receiver is assumed to be true, but that does not enable receiving more than channel capacity allows.

Terrible advice - most people will forget the seed in the long term. Keep your 24 seed words backed up in a few separate trusted places. Use your own passphrases (aka 25th seed word) and memorize only those. PIN can be forgotten - it's not part of a seed. Disclaimer: I'm basing this on Trezor. Other HW wallets might work differently.

Is channel capacity public information? Even if it's not being reported directly, some channel capacity information must be leaked when communicating at the protocol level while searching for a valid route. I'm guessing it might be possible in some circumstances to figure out which node paid which other node by tracking channel capacity changes. I wonder where can I find some discussions on this privacy topic.

Use BIP39 to make your seed use a passphrase. Memorize the passphrase. Now the only way to recover the wallet is to have both, the 24 words AND your memorized passphrase. Make sure you back up your 24 words in at least 2 separate physical locations. Even better if you split the seed words into chunks and don't keep all 24 words in one place if you're backing up in many places.
Example reading from Trezor:
Also, if you memorize the passphrase, have someone you trust (e.g. wife) also have it memorized if you want someone to get your coins in case of your death or similar.

Small nit-pick: passphrase, not password. Passphrases tend to be stronger, but saying password causes people to come up with a single word or a weaker phrase.

Well, it seems plausible at first glance, but the only thing I can agree on for now is that much more research is needed. It's a complex mathematical, technical, and game-theoretical beast of an environment, so there should be endless opportunities for research and shenanigans. I imagine there won't be just one motivated entity trying to "scalp" the system. I wonder how will multiple such entities interact with each other over the network. We might see Lightning Network "warfare" going on :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:34:50
Unfortunately, this method can't address scalability and greatly compromises security. Let's compare increasing chain capacity 10 times vs creating 10 chains with the original capacity. These should be equivalent capacity wise. The multi-chain loses on the complexity side. But that's irrelevant because it loses big-time on the security. It now becomes way way easier to attack any one of the chains because it takes 10 times less hashing power to do so. Another big problem is transacting across these multi-chains as if it was one chain. You can't send across chain directly. You could do chain swaps, but that requires a transaction on both chains, which reduces the benefit of splitting the chains. There are probably other downsides I didn't think of, and I'm not sure about any upsides. As you can see, splitting the chain does not achieve scalability. Also, a 10x capacity increase is not close to what's needed. Image how this method becomes even worse with having 100 or 1000 chains.
Maybe there are some technical solutions that would mitigate these problems, but you'd have to come up with specifics on how that would work.

To receive right away, the channel partner has to fund it (fully or partially). Otherwise, if only you fund the channels you open, you can't receive until you spend some of it first. After you spend, you can receive up to the amount you've spent.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:01:09
They can use that balance to route payments to you. If you have more than one channel, then they can probably use it to route to even more nodes through your channels.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:10:16


 
The network does not care who broadcasts. It only cares about what is broadcasted. Authenticity is proved by the content of the message (i.e. signatures) not the messenger.


It does not invalidate the protection scheme. You can't frame the other party by broadcasting an old state pretending to be the other party because you don't have their private signing keys (i.e. you can't sign it with their signature).

@_date: 2018-01-11 06:45:54
I don't think there's any disagreement between us. What I said and what you said - it's all correct.


I said this in the context of calculating how much you can receive (upper theoretical limit). Said another way - routing a payment does not change the potential limits of how much you can spend or receive (not accounting for fees, which do change the potential limits because they add or take away from your net balance).


I am describing more generally. What I describe is true regardless of a scenario, it applies to all scenarios, or rather, it applies to any node, whether that node is an "end-user" or a merchant or any other LN participant (node).
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:09:05
Confidential transactions would be very very expensive if implemented directly into Bitcoin, so it would only get implemented if it's optional. When it's a lot more expensive, almost no one will use it, so the very few who would be willing to pay extra to use it will not do it because their privacy would be defeated because transactions before and after them would likely be non-private - thus revealing the amounts being transacted. Grin/mimblewimble is the only realistic privacy coin/protocol that may get somehow integrated with bitcoin as a sidechain or some other similar method and add some serious competition to monero.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:31:26


Why would the order matter? Each signature is distinct. Also, a signature indicates agreement, so it does not matter in which order the parties agreed. A cheating attempt by publishing an old state never has both signatures because clearly only one party signed it - the cheating one.


A penalty transaction is not the same as a cheating tx (old state tx). Incorrectly publishing a penalty tx can't be interpreted as cheating and allowing the other party to publish their own penalty transaction.

It's a bank account with a max balance limit. For example, you open a bank account with $200 in it, then the accounts max limit is $200 and you can't put in/receive an amount that would exceed this limit.

Yes, and this is true regardless of what node or how many nodes A is connected to. Theoretical maximum amount a node can receive is the sum of all incoming channel amounts. In your scenario node A can receive up to 1 BTC.


Good question. You either open a channel that you fully fund and spend some money through it, after which you can receive up to that amount, or you open a channel with someone who will fund their side and then you can receive up to that amount.

A channel can't be emptied by one party right away, both must agree and sign the transaction for that. One party can close the channel without the other party, but such type of closing is subject to a time-lock. If the time-locked closing transaction happens to have incorrect balances (i.e. attempt to steal funds) the other party can issue a penalty transaction during the time-lock period which gives all of the funds to them.

If C wants to pay A, it has to find a valid route. A route through B is not valid. B does not have to do anything as it's not interested nor aware of C's intention to pay A.


Yes, that's specifically how LN works.


Correct, if B is not planning to pay A and A can't route payments coming from B, then B would not fund a channel with A. Nodes are motivated to open channels that are useful.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:33:29
This provides privacy from the nodes through which the payment is being routed - it does not provide privacy from someone who can monitor channel amount changes throughout the network. If someone is routing 0.13374242 BTC through 10 nodes, and I see that there's a node who's routing capacity dropped by this amount and another node who's capacity increased by that amount, at about the same time, I can deduce with high level of confidence that the former node paid the latter node this amount.

@_date: 2018-01-22 03:04:12


I don't think so. It should work well. I'll explain why that is below by answering your subsequent questions.




This is a very good observation and question. Time will tell. My thoughts are that maybe there will be incentive to open such channels if through network topology analysis it is determined that creating a path through the user will yield a well route-able path. Even if that's the case, there might still be many user nodes to which no one will want to open channels with and add their funds to. Regardless, such users are not doomed. They can still receive funds as I explain below.




As the user spends through their channel, that amount accumulates on the other side of the channel and becomes "directed to the user" - meaning - whatever the user spends, can now be received back. So as you can see, it's not necessary that someone opens a channel directed to the user for that user to receive funds. That's only necessary if user wants to receive without spending first.
I hope I clarified well enough. If not, or you have more questions, let me know.

You're saying that making too much money on routing fees is somehow bad? That's quite a stretch. You can reduce your LN funds by spending through LN or closing a channel in which most of its funds are on your end.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:20:43


It's a matter of perspective. If LN is useful for sending and receiving cheaper transactions, then putting money in channels is "freeing" the money and closing channels and transferring back to a regular bitcoin address is "tying up" the money.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:25:23


Are you implying there should be no on-chain transactions to use Bitcoin? Something tells me that's not likely to be possible.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:46:01
I think we're in agreement - just might have misunderstood some of each other's comments.
You can receive more than you put in. You can receive what other party of the channel puts in. I said you can receive up to sum of all your channels' capacities. Channel capacity is the total amount in that channel, regardless of how it's allocated between the two parties. So in your example, channel capacity is 3. Let's say you have five channels like that. Then total capacity for you is 15. Your total spending capacity is 5, your total receiving capacity is 10.

@_date: 2018-01-13 05:59:10
You're correct, only balance states that existed can be broadcasted. Penalty transactions (taking all of the funds) are only valid if/after the other party broadcasts an old state.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:03:20
A channel is owned by two parties (i.e. you and whoever you opened the channel with). A channel can be closed cooperatively by both parties or uncooperatively by either of the two parties. I'm not sure about how the fees are figured out.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:40:29


You're missing another way to have &gt;50% attackers. What you describe is adding as many attackers as there are current honest hashing power. You're overlooking the fact that half of existing power can collude and become attackers. This is typically considered more plausible and achievable. Also, anything between these two ends of the spectrum is possible. For example, colluding with 40% of existing power and adding 20% new power.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:48:17


Then it's too late, you lost your money.
Keep in mind that a cheating transaction is a unilateral channel closing transaction (i.e. signed only by one party). Such transactions are subject to a time-locked period, so it's not like as soon as a cheating transaction is published it's included in the blockchain and can be spent.


I assume a higher fee has a chance of getting in first, although many nodes only propagate the one they've seen first (aka first-seen-safe).
Regardless, it doesn't matter if they're cheating tx gets picked up first. Realistically you actually want them to publish a cheating tx, because you can then publish a penalty tx and take all the funds in the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:28:47


Will, it is what it is, take it or leave it. If you take it, learn about it and find ways to explain the essence of it in simple terms and help spread the knowledge.


I haven't heard of mandatory gift cards. Did you make up this scenario for the purpose of having an analogy for LN channels?
Anyway, ignoring the mandatory part, you can indeed think of it like a gift card, but it's a visa gift card so you can spend it anywhere visa cards are accepted. Oh, also, you can receive money into the gift card to "refill" it (up to its original capacity). And, if you have multiple such gift cards, there is a chance you can earn a little from fees if someone routes some payments through your cards.


An opened channel is simply a 2-of-2 multisig bitcoin address with the channel funds.
Who gets what portion of the balance is managed by the channel parties keeping signed transactions and creating new ones when balance is agreed to be changed among them.


Depends on the software used (existing or future). Some wallets will hide most of the advanced and technical details from the user, and some wallets will provide more fine-tuning.


What do you mean by "set reserves"? I haven't heard this terminology in the context of LN.


Scenario you described is for a simple case of an isolated payment channel - this is not LN. Isolated payment channel has more limited use cases - namely what you described - if two parties intend to have many transactions between themselves.
Most of the scaling happens due to the network of payment channels (hence LN name). This allows you to open a few channels but potentialy transact with most of the network participants through these few channels. It's still mainly limited to cases where users plan to regularly transact back and forth (pay for things and receive as well), but now paying and receiving is not restricted to one party at the other end of the channel as it is with isolated payment channels.


Similarly to an earlier answer, this all depends on the wallet software and its UI. There are more than one to chose from and there will be plenty more.


No. Penalty transaction (taking all of the funds) is possible/valid only if a secret penalty code is known, which is by design revealed only by the other party publishing an old state transaction (i.e. attempting to cheat). So in short, it's not possible to cheat with the anti-cheat (penalty) tx.


Social engineering? Maybe fool someone to send you money? As far as the other party of the node, there isn't much to socially engineer as most of this stuff is managed by software. Good luck socially engineering a computer program. As for "otherwise", you could always hack into the other party's computer, steal their keys, and then use them to take all the funds. In fact, you could use this trick to steal bitcoins or any other crypto currencies. Shocker.

A merchant has income and expenses. If they receive money through LN and spend money through LN, they don't need to close the channels as they can use them for all this activity.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:58:09
Some parts of the routing design definitely can (and are) taken from existing known solutions; however, LN is novel enough to have some aspects of routing that introduce additional constraints and caveats that existing routing solutions do not address (e.g. channel capacities, fees, time-locks).
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:11:30
Think of LN similar to internet - everyone is free to join and participate in the network. There will be big players and there will be small players (and all sizes in between) - just like the internet - you'll have your googles, microsofts, and apples of the network and you'll have your small-time players. Routing capacity depends on the amount of coins a node has committed to a channel, so anyone who's spending and receiving money will be able to provide routing capacity. Nodes who will be spending and receiving large sums of money through the network will naturally be able to route large amounts of transactions for others and collect some fees.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:57:45
You should add a routing capacity by node chart. Routing capacity should be the smaller of the incoming capacity and outgoing capacity. Node capacity = incoming capacity + outgoing capacity. Node routing capacity = min(incoming capacity, outgoing capacity).
You might then also show network rounding capacity as the sum of individual node routing capacities.

You open some channels, you're now participating in the LN network. You pay some LN participants that you don't have direct channels with. You receive some payments from other LN participants. Some participants route some payments through you. You close your channels. Your channel opening and closing transactions go to the bitcoin blockchain. What do those bitcoin transactions reveal? Not much. Tracking payments through LN is probably possible with varying levels of success depending on the levels of infiltration; however, there will always be regular non-tracking nodes in the network. Plus, to be able to route payments, a node must have money committed in its channels - this means that majority of the network has to consist of participants who are actually participants in the economy and producers of actual economic activity. I'm not saying it's not technically possible to extract and deduce information by having spying nodes in the network, but, it will be significantly harder technically and financially to do so.

Let's say you want to pay some entity in bitcoin, but you don't want that payment to be public knowledge or traced back through chain analysis or other means. You open some channels with some safe entities (e.g. your friends, trusted companies, etc). You then pay the entity through LN (because there's some route through the network that reaches that entity). That's it. It becomes very hard to figure out who paid who with LN. You settle your channels on the main chain at some point, put that public information of opening and closing channels reveals no information of who you paid or who paid you and what amounts.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:05:59
I did not fully understand your question so I'm not sure if I'm answering the right thing, but here it goes...
You can only ever receive as much as the sum of how much you put in and then spent (routing others' payments does not count) plus how much your channel partners have put in (to your channels).
It's definitely a limitation on use cases. That's one of the big differences between LN and a bank account. I can open a near-empty bank account and receive large sums of money into it. With LN, if my channels are not sufficient to receive a large payment, the sender has to either pay me directly on the 1st layer or pay me via LN by opening a funded channel with me.
If whoever is paying you can anticipate additional similar payments in the future, it might make sense to go the LN way instead of doing one-time payments directly on the 1st layer.
All in all, LN is more useful if you can receive and spend on it regularly. That's the end goal after all, so it's nice that the network should get better and more useful as it grows and activity within it grows. It's almost like inverse scaling - it needs some critical mass before it can start seriously taking off.

I agree that this not a universal downside. Rather, it's one of two options/preferences. The downside is that Taproot only supports one option. The upside is that it supports the one with more privacy. Also, the downside is limited only to the context of efficiency - Taproot is more efficient, but the other option can still be achieved using regular MAST; the tradeoff is in a larger TX (higher fee). All in all it's great when more private options are actually cheaper and more efficient.

To clarify, it's not like anyone can settle your channel just because they participated in routing your payment. Only the two parties owning a channel can close/settle that channel. In the bar analogy, if you paid the bar directly via a channel between you and the bar, then yes, the bar can choose to close it. However, if you paid the bar by routing the payment, let's say through Bob, the bar can choose to close the channel with Bob but it has no effect on your channel with Bob - it has no way to close your channels with others. This makes it somewhat different from the tap analogy. You open a "tap" with the bar, but then you might be able to pay for the groceries using the bar "tap".

Sorry, I didn't pay enough attention to the title when I asked. I see you sent it to your Coinbase account, so no, you did not send it to your address. I should have asked, did you send it to an address which you have the private keys for? Coinbase manages addresses for you, so you don't have the private keys for those. The reason I asked is I was going to suggest using CPFP (child-pays-for-parent) to get your transaction to go through. At this point you have two options: 1. Wait for tx to drop off the mempool or get confirmed 2. Contact coinbase and ask them nicely to use CPFP (probably not likely to happen but I've seen stories of others contacting Coinbase support and getting their tx cleared).

Your max spending capacity and max receiving capacity at any given point in time adds up to the total channel capacity at that time.
So, if we continue with our example of having five channels with a capacity of 3 each, and initial allocation of 5 to spend and 10 to receive, then, let's say you receive 10, you can now spend 15 but can't receive any more. If you then spend all 15, now you can receive up to 15 but can't spend any more. You can keep doing this many times - spending and receiving - within these limits. Keep in mind these are theoretical best-case-scenario limits. In practice, these limits will be lower and vary for you over different parts of the network (i.e. depending who you're paying or who's paying you) determined by capacity limitations of other nodes through which the payments are routed.

To further expand...


Anonymity is for specific routed payments, which should stay that way. This does not prevent overall network liquidity analysis - it may help, but there is other useful and much more relevant information, primarily, channel capacities.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:11:20


This just means that all of the money in the channel is on the other side (i.e. belongs to the other owner of the channel). The other owner is still very interested in closing the channel and "getting back" the money. Of course you can both keep the channel open and let others route money through your channel, in which case your channel will get rebalanced and you will start having a balance on it again.


Yes, just like exchanging/paying for any other goods and services with crypto.

If Alice routes a payment for someone, then her node balance (sum of outgoing capacity of each of her channels) will stay the same; if payment originates with her (she pays someone) then her node balance will be observed to decrease; if she receives a payment her balance will increase. Is this not correct?
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:28:24
That is my understanding as well - channel capacity can't be private information because it must be provided for route searching. If someone creates something like a web-crawler to crawl through the LN network and constantly track channels and their capacity states, they might have enough information to deduce many transactions. I wonder if there are ways to counter this.

I was responding to someone who asked a question but deleted the comment before I submitted my reply. For my reply to not go to waste, here's the original question and my reply. Maybe someone will still find it useful:


The only way you can make money directly with LN as a participant of the network is by getting fees for routing payments. To be able to route payments, you must have at least two channels with two separate nodes. You must also have your own funds in at least one of the channels (receiving funds via LN also counts) to act as an outgoing channel when routing a transaction. You must also have at least one channel with the other node having their side of the channel funded to act as an incoming channel when routing a transaction.
Stated another way, to be capable of routing a payment, you must have a channel that can act as incoming channel and another channel that can act as outgoing channel. A channel can act as an incoming channel if there are funds on the other side of the channel. A channel can act as an outgoing channel if there are funds on your side of the channel (your funds).
I hope that's clear enough.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:23:52
People might see your channel, but no money could be sent, received, or routed to your isolated "network" because there are no channels to route any money through to reach your nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:57:00


Technically, by the current protocol, an unconfirmed transaction is always valid (i.e. never expires) - it can be included in a block a year later and it will be valid (if it's not double spent). So it's a matter of node policy whether to keep your unconfirmed tx "alive". I.e. I could personally run a node and keep rebroadcasting all unconfirmed transactions forever. This does not mean you're out of luck. You can create a new transaction with higher fees and it's not invalid if it's included in a block, it's just that depending on a miner, they might have a policy to ignore additional transactions spending the same outputs if they already have an earlier tx (i.e. to prevent double spends). I'm almost sure you can find a miner that will eventually include your latter tx with the higher fee (because money).


Like I said in a previous comment, use CPFP (if you don't mind paying for 2 transactions instead of 1). Your new wallet (where you sent the money to) should show you the unconfirmed transaction and should let you to spend the unconfirmed transaction. That's how you use CPFP - spend the unconfirmed tx by sending it to yourself to a new address with a high enough fee to cover both transactions.
Or can I use my seed phrase to recover my wallet and resend the transaction?
You could do that as well, yes. Double spend yourself.


Your unconfirmed transaction should show up. Does blockchain.info does not show unconfirmed transactions? Google it. There are definitely ways to look it up online. Check multiple blockchain explorers. If none of them show the tx, then it should be easy for you to double spend yourself by propagating a new transaction out. If your current wallet doesn't let you because it thinks you've already spent it, try recovering it from the seed. If it doesn't help, recover the seed into a better wallet.

But one member could have tons of btc so the cap would be huge.  I think any way :D
Unfortunately that's also not the case. You can never be paid more than the sum of all your channels' capacities. Somebody having tons of btc committed to their channels has no effect on how much you can get paid. If they have a channel with you, it also does not mean you can get paid as much as their total committed btc, only as much as the capacity of the channel with them.
The only way you can receive more than you put into your channels is by having your channel partners put in some of their own btc in the channels with you.
Well, there is the other way in which you can receive more - but that depends on your definition of receiving more. You can receive unlimited amounts **over time** in chunks, as long as you keep re-spending what you receive in LN.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:39:46

@_date: 2018-01-21 08:30:28
No, not possible. A main chain tx is needed. Receiving capacity of a node is the sum of all outer balances of that node's channels. If node B wants to receive $100 and they only have one channel, that channel must have $100 balance on the 'outer' side.

Open a channel with a 3-month lock time. That should be enough time to get your tx into the blockchain in case your "channel partner" stops cooperating. Point is, know your risks and what you're getting into. If it's not for you, don't use it. Many people will find the risk acceptable. If shit doesn't work as many people expect, and people start losing money, people will learn and adapt and adjust their behavior.

It will increase anonymity on the Bitcoin network, because the only information on the blockchain will show you sending to a multisig address (opening a channel) and then receiving from a multisig (closing a channel). It will not be possible to conclusively determine which addresses you paid to or received from just by knowing your channel opening and closing transactions.
Having said that, it's yet to be seen how easy or hard it will be to do analysis on the lightning network to de-anonymize participants and their payments (as can be done with the Bitcoin blockchain). It will almost certainly be a lot harder to do this on LN compared to Bitcoin, but it might still be plausible.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:05:18
You still need one on chain tx to get into a group of nodes within which opening channels will not require an on chain tx. Then one more tx to settle. Think of LN like channel factories too, but the group size is always just 2 nodes, so you can only have one channel in the group. Channel factories just have no group limit.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:00:18
Opening a channel costs one transaction on the bitcoin network, so whatever that cost of a transaction at the time. Cooperatively closing a channel is the same. I think it's also possible to merge closing one channel and opening another into one transaction (i.e. saving one bitcoin tx).

Yes and no. Optimal routing is a solved problem if the whole network state is known. But in practice, nodes will not have the full visibility to the entire network (too much data and bandwidth use), so routing algorithms are heuristic (not guaranteed to be optimal). But in practice getting close to optimal most of the time is good enough. Current routing designs are good enough for the first year or two, but they're less adequate for networks having millions of nodes, which can be expected in some years to come. Routing will definitely be improved as the network grows, but by how much is yet to be seen.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:28:16


Miners can't demand fees. Fees are set by transaction makers. Miners get to pick which transactions to include. Even if all transactions are 5 cents each, miners will still include them because the alternative is to not include and make less money. Cost to the miner to include a transaction is negligible, so it's always worth including a tx, even with a tiny fee.

@_date: 2018-01-25 19:01:31


You have the cause and effect backwards. Mining expenditure follows mining revenue (block reward + fees) to maintain a margin of profitability.
Reward goes down (due to lower fees) lets call this the new "normal" &gt; mining power goes down (least efficient mining drops out) &gt; tx capacity goes down &gt; fees increase (due to lower capacity - lower supply but same demand) &gt; some miners come back (higher revenue) &gt; eventually difficulty adjusts to be lower &gt; most miners come back (lower expenses) &gt; capacity increases, resumes to "normal" &gt; fees decrease to "normal"
End result:
Revenue is lower (the new "normal" of lower fees due to your suggested scenario)
Expenses are lower (due to now-lower difficulty)
Profitability is maintained, albeit slightly lower. Because total mining reward of the network is lower, total mining expenses fall to remain profitable - least efficient (hence least profitable) miners drop out, but the most efficient miners remain at full power (why not, they're still making profit).
Basically, to sum up, all this means is that mining will always be there, proportional to rewards available. The most efficient miners will always be profitable (first due to higher fees, then due to lower difficulty). A quick increase in rewards (more fees and/or higher coin value) simply allow the less efficient miners to temporarily come back to the mining game (until new more efficient mining comes in and pushes them out of profitability again). Conversely, a quick decrease in rewards (lower fees and/or lower coin value) "kicks out" a lot of least efficient miners but then after difficulty adjusts allows some of them back in the game.

Interesting. I don't yet see how Alice can benefit from doing this without the risk of the whole manipulation backfiring. I'm not claiming this can't be a valid attack vector or something that allows bad actors to gain an advantage and/or degrade the network. Time will tell.
First, it will cost some fees.
Second, this does not affect anyone's theoretical max capacity to spend or receive, it just moves the funds between channels for people in this routing loop.
Third, any node in the loop that was used to route this, can route via the same loop in the opposite direction, undoing everything Alice did. If Alice depletes channels while doing this, then all such channels will have lower or even negative fees in order to rebalance their channels, thus, very likely, undoing what Alice did will cost less than what it cost Alice.
I'm interested in further pondering about this and similar scenarios, so if you have more thoughts to share, please do!
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:37:25


It will probably vary a lot. Sometimes you'll see negative fees across some channels. Other nodes who will want to keep channel capacity for themselves will set high fees to discourage routing through them in a particular direction.


Hard to say. It will probably be higher on average, but that's just my guess.


Costs are actually dependent on amount transacted. The scarce resource in LN is routing capacity (aka liquidity) which gets affected proportionately to the amount being routed.


That's what current lighting protocol has right now - a flat fee plus a percentage fee.

Yeah, but most, if not all, will be closed in time using the penalty transaction, so other than few stealing the funds from those channels, majority will lose their funds to the exchange due to the exchange publishing the penalty txs.

I'm not sure how you are arriving at the conclusion.


I think you've misspelled the word 'opinion'.


I think LN wallets will handle this for most users. More advanced users will use the more advanced features that give them more control. It's very early days still and a lot of trial and error will happen while slowly improving overall.


Well connected nodes will be in a business of facilitating as many transactions as possible, so they will be motivated to create new channels and rebalance existing channels to achieve that goal.


This is a low level software responsibility - routing (route discovery, etc)


Can you expand on this? Putting more or less in a channel does not cost more. Unless you mean users might not allocate their LN funds across multiple channels optimally, but that will not cost them more LN fees, it just might make their own channels less route-able for others and so will make them less money in fees. Or, you mean that users might open channels in a part of the network which happens to have higher fees than if they opened a channel in a more favorable part of the network.

False. A transaction can't pass through a node which has not committed any funds of their own.
To explain - imagine you're a node. 1000 other nodes each open a channel with you and provide the funds. All these channels are useless for routing because they are all one-way and pointing to you. The only use case is if someone is paying you (i.e. you are the final destination of a transaction). If someone pays you, net result is the same as you committing those funds. So, when you commit funds (by bringing your own or receiving a LN payment), then is when you can route payments for others.

Right, so it's 150M people doing one transaction per year, each, (or 75M doing 2 tx per year) versus 75M people doing potentially thousands of transactions per year, each.
75M is the max. Let's see what can make it lower.
I'm not sure how long realistically people will keep their channels open, but I think average channel lifespan will be less than a year.
I also think that on average, people will open more than one channel. This means we'd have a number that's less than 75M.
Now the upside.
I think a channel can be closed and a new one opened in one transaction, but I don't recall the details. Assuming this works, it would mean that channel cost is not 2 tx but somewhere between 1 and 2 depending on the ratio of tx which close one channel and open another in one tx.
Lightning network needs segwit transactions. If all tx are segwit, then about 4000 fit per block, or around 210M per year (as opposed to 150M).
I believe Schnorr sigs will be out this or next year and I think those will increase tx capacity a bit.

Right, transacting small payments on Bitcoin blockchain directly is a no go. But what point are you trying to make with stating this fact? I think everyone agrees with that fact. If there is no point you're trying to make, then what's the purpose? Is it to inform others who might not be aware of this fact? If the point is to imply the opinion that bitcoin should aim at making smaller transactions more affordable, then I think almost everyone agrees - and that's being done. If the point is that it's happening too slowly, then again, no one argues that the faster this happens the better.

You claim that Litecoin should be 1/4 the value per coin because it has 4 times more coins. Said in another way, you're saying total Litecoin value should be equal to that of total Bitcoin value because it was designed that way.
You might have meant to say that IF litecoin completely takes over bitcoin OR splits the market evenly with bitcoin THEN litecoin price should be around 1/4 of bitcoin, per coin.
Now this would be a valid statement, but it applies only to two very specific scenarios. You should explain why at least one of these two scenarios is plausible.
In all other scenarios, Litecoin coin value ranges from near zero to insanely high. Realistic scenario is probably that litecoin never takes over bitcoin and never reaches nowhere near 1/4 of bitcoin value.

Unless new coin production is a percentage of total supply, it's deflationary long-term, even if new coins are produced forever. The difference is only in how fast inflation drops.

To use CPFP (child pays for parent), you do not need a wallet that supports it. If you control the receiving address, just send it to another address and use a double fee so that this fee is enough to cover both transactions. Miners will pick it up. Simple example: let's say lowest fee to get into next block is 30 sat/wu. Let's also assume both of your transactions are same weight. Then just use a 60 sat/wu or slightly higher fee. You're welcome.

Find out if your transaction had RBF enabled, in which case you can just make a new transaction with a higher fee and it will replace the one with the lower fee. If you can't use RBF, next best thing is to use CPFP (child pays for parent). You can use this because you control the receiving address. Simply send from your receiving address (the one with the incoming unconfirmed tx) to another address you own, but set the fee so that it's high enough to cover both transactions. Does that help?

Actually the cost is strongly related to the size of the transaction because each transaction reduces your routing capacity by the transaction amount in the direction of that transaction, and, conversely, increases the routing capacity by the same amount in the opposite direction. If routing demand is balanced well in all directions, then fees will probably be low, but when demand is higher in one direction vs the other, your routing will quickly become depleted in the direction of higher routing demand. You'd want to set fees higher in direction of higher demand and lower or even negative in direction of lowest demand. Basic economics of supply and demand will determine how fees are chosen.

False. A transaction can't pass through a node which has not committed any funds of their own.
Edit: To explain - imagine you're a node. 1000 other nodes each open a channel with you and provide the funds. All these channels are useless for routing because they are all one-way and pointing to you. The only use case is if someone is paying you (i.e. you are the final destination of a transaction). If someone pays you, net result is the same as you committing those funds. So, when you commit funds (by bringing your own or receiving a LN payment), then is when you can route payments for others.

No you're right. I'm just highlighting a counter intuitive mathematical property. Let there be a coin with a constant supply. In 20 years, inflation of that coin will be 5% vs ~0.8% for Bitcoin. In 50 years it's 2% vs nearly 0%. In 200 years it's 0.5% vs 0%. You can see that in the long term, even constant supply coins will effectively become non-inflationary and mostly deflationary if there's some rate of coin loss. The only difference is the time scale. This property holds true even if the reward increases with each block (i.e. block coin reward = block number, so reward is 1, then 2, then 3, etc). Even more counter intuitively, this property holds true for any constant power of block number (i.e. if block rewards are 1, then 4, then 8, then 16, then 32, etc).

Well, to join the network, you need to open at least one channel. To be able to route payments for others, you need at least two channels (tx goes in through one, leaves through another). Once you have some channels open, then you will not necessarily need to open a new channel each time you're transacting with someone new (because payments will be routed through existing channels.

I think you fundamentally misunderstand your scenario. If dollar "crumbles", BTC value will not hover around the same BTC to USD exchange ratio. BTC price in dollars would go to 1M, 10M, 100M, 1B, etc. You get the picture. See Zimbabwe's hyperinflation for reference. In other words, if 1 Bitcoin buys you 5 Lambos, and dollar starts to crumble, that bitcoin will still buy you 5 Lambos all else being equal. In a more realistic scenario, BTC value would most likely increase even more, as everyone will begin dumping all their dollars while they're still worth more than a toilet paper sheet.

Mining reward has two components: fixed reward and the sum of all transaction fees. So if there are no or few transactions, miners still get the fixed reward which is independent of number of transactions.
And the "complex" math problem is neither complex nor a problem. It's a simple and well defined algorithm (SHA256) comprised of a series of simple operations. The math solution has no practical use (i.e. it's not solving to discover new prime numbers or doing protein folding calculations) outside of Bitcoin itself and serves as proof of work and proof that this work was done on specific set of data and is not valid on any other data - resulting in high degree of immutability (i.e. securing transaction data).

At what cost are you willing to make bitcoin more usable as currency for small payments? There are many powerful actors that would jump on any opportunity to destroy or subvert bitcoin. Decentralization is the only thing that allows Bitcoin to have a chance of surviving. I'm personally not in favor of reducing those chances of survival. If another crypto currency takes over the small transaction market, that's fine. Bitcoin will compete with that soon too, without sacrificing decentralization.

I never said anything about nodes or blockchain impact. You must be confusing me with some other redditors' comments.
Having said that, it seems you are saying miners &amp; mining nodes have the most power in the bitcoin network. If that's the case, then my argument for the need of decentralization is even stronger. Mining decentralization should be even a higher priority then. We should aim to increase it and avoid changes that decrease it. The main topic of discussion in this context is how strong is the correlation between block size and mining centralization, and, what block size threshold is safe enough.

To achieve this, first and foremost, the network has to be long-term robust and secure. Without it, there will not be enough trust in the network for it to grow to such scale and adoption level. To be this robust, the network must be as decentralized as possible. Block size correlates inversely with decentralization (hence robustness) of the network. Following this logic it can be argued that larger and larger blocks will not produce most of the other goals you want to see happen. Good news is that all of the other things you listed CAN be achieved - in other ways. Other ways have better trade-offs when compared to increasing block size.

It's not as black and white as you state. Mining that's primarily done with general-purpose-hardware is potentially susceptible to botnet attacks.

If you cleared your addresses and sent them all to an exchange, thus having no change address, then I'm not sure... gotta wait till nodes start dropping off your tx - expires, kind-of - but AFAIK some nodes may retransmit your tx and keep it alive for a long time - not sure how likely that is though.

I'm a bit puzzled and frustrated as well. Yes, fees should be calculated and compared in sat/wu; however, I barely see it used anywhere. This makes it annoying and hard to figure out what fee to set.

Right, but it's a bit more interesting than that. Him taking 25% profit on $4000 investment is equivalent to investing $1000 himself. If by 2020 his friend's value is under $4000, then he effectively borrowed a $1000 for ~2 years at 100% API. In the other case, he effectively borrowed at 0% API. Assuming he has no money to spend on bitcoin, and no way to borrow $1000 at a decent rate so that his only choice is a credit card purchase at 30% API, then he made a good deal if he believes the chances of price being higher by 2020 is 77% or greater. If he can borrow $1000 at 10%, then he still made a good deal if chances are 93% or higher.

- linking the invoice to the receiving BTC address
- providing the signed double spent tx (the one paying to that address but provably not in the blockchain)
- linking the double spent tx (showing a tx in the blockchain that spends these same outputs)
- finally, linking the perpetrator to those transactions

I think amount of value stored in other coins will depend on their security level and on bitcoins ability to provide fast and affordable transactions (hint: LN). I think most of savings value will stay with Bitcoin as long as it has the best security guarantees. If LN and other similar solutions cover the transactional demand well, then even most of that value will stay with Bitcoin.

Can you clarify? I didn't understand what you mean. I was saying that there is no difference whether his wallet is a segwit or non-segwit address for the purposes of using LN. Using LN means opening a channel. Opening a channel means moving coins to a multisig address (has to be segwit). If someone has their coins in a segwit address, they would still need to do a transaction to move those coins to a multisig channel address. The coins can come from a non-segwit address just the same, so keeping coins in a non-segwit address in no way hinders the ability to use LN.

The difficulty definitely follows the block reward price + fees (i.e. profit), but it's amortized by expected profit. Or said better, difficulty follows expected profit. If miners anticipate a recovery in price, they might keep mining. Likewise, if miners anticipate price to go lower, they might stop mining ahead of the becoming not profitable.

This is done by various algorithms that are being improved upon over time. Currently the network is small enough that a node can easily know and maintain a full graph of the network. Information about node connectivity is shared between the nodes via the "gossip" messages - basically a node can ask another node about their channels. When a node wants to pay another node, they can use the knowledge of the network graph to find possible routes and pick one that seems best. Once the route is selected the onion-encrypted payment routing can begin.
In case the full network graph is not known by the payer and no routes can be found via the known subgraph, the payer can start exploring the unknown graph in search of a viable route by asking other nodes for additional information about additional channels. Typically heuristic algorithms are used for this purpose to get good results while string efficient enough to be feasible.

Each mined block is one big transaction with all of the inputs and outputs of the smaller transactions it was composed of. In fact, the entire blockchain is just one giant transaction with no inputs and all of the unspent outputs, with all outputs adding up to the total supply, which is simply block count * reward (always constant). So no transaction graph whatsoever stored on the blockchain. It's still possible to reconstruct some of the activity if one keeps a snapshot of the full blockchain after each block, basically analyzing the diff between each block, and trying to match up inputs and outputs. However, since transactions can be merged with each other as soon as they're relayed, honest nodes, when receiving multiple transactions, would always merge them and relay them as one bigger and bigger transaction. This makes it way harder to deduce who's paying who.

Data being hashed (block header) is only 80 bytes. This data is updated frequently anyway. New block mined? Update block hash (32 bytes), timestamp (4 bytes), reset nonce (4 bytes), update merkle root (32 bytes). All values of a nonce are exhausted in 1/25th of a second on a 100 GHashes/s miner, so typically a new merkle root hash needs to be provided constantly, many times per second. There is no downside to including new validated transactions into the block being mined frequently.

You will have to pay a higher fee when you'll spend from that address. I think it's about twice as expensive. How much more you'll pay also depends on how many unspent outputs you have for that address. If you transfered many times into that address and decide to sweep the address (spending/transferring all of those outputs in one transaction), the fee will be much higher than for an average transaction in general (even if it was a segwit address) so the non-segwit "fee multiplier" would be that much more painful (if fees'd be high at the time).


Almost certainly no.

Bitcoin mainchain will be way more expansive than that, per transaction, if it were to truly be successful. If transactions would stay at this level, I'd say it's probably losing, not winning. Competition to credit cards will have to come with additional scaling solutions, and unless there are some very serious breakthroughs, this will happen on additional layers. Of course I would still call it Bitcoin, and success of additional layers directly translate to success for Bitcoin (i.e. LN).

In simple terms, ddos works because the attacker has to spend less resources than the target.

Being able to sign many inputs with one signature reduces the fee costs significantly for many input cases. Smart coin selection algorithms can take advantage of these cost savings which should result in more transactions having more inputs, thus reducing the UTXO set by increasing average transaction input/output ratio. I don't think it would be a massive decrease, but should be non-negligible.

Great explanation. While we're talking about picking nice numbers, I personally would love if we started measuring bitcoin amounts in terms of fractions of 21M so that each amount immediately tells you how much that is in terms of the whole supply (including the yet unmined coins).
Conversion (@ ~$5700 / BTC)
21M BTC = 1 Bs ("the bitcoin supply") ~= $120 billion
2.1M BTC = 1 dBs (deci) ~= $12 billion
210K BTC = 1 cBs (centi) ~= $1.2 billion
21K BTC = 1 mBs (milli) ~= $120 million
21 BTC = 1 μBs (micro) ~= $120,000
1 BTC ~= 47.6 nBs (nano) ~= $5700
0.021 BTC = 21 mBTC = 1 nBs (nano) ~= $120
0.000021 BTC = 21 μBTC = 2100 satoshis = 1 pBs (pico) ~= $0.12

Since, I presume, exchanges don't hold each user's coins in separate addresses, they will be splitting the coins themselves. After that, depending on the exchange, they will allow withdrawing and/or trading coins of the type they support, and possibly add withdrawing and/or trading of the other type at a later time.
As for providing instructions, that depends on them. It's a good thing to provide information, so they should, but we can't know until they say so.

The channel has to be funded, so if you're not funding it, then someone else has to fund it when opening a channel with you.
Here are some reasons someone might open a channel with you:
1. You have payment routing potential (i.e. the channel will be useful) (hint: if you don't have any funded channels, you can't route payments, only receive payments)
2. You convince them that you will have payment routing potential
3. Out of kindness of their heart (i.e. your friend)

Unfortunately that's how it works. Any trading on an exchange is a taxable event (i.e. each buy and each sell). One way this is justified is that when you sell, you get the currency (e.g. USD) credited to your exchange account, which is not much different than your bank account - it is still your account. I think the bigger issue here is the $3000 claimable loss limit (in US). I was dumb enough to do some trading during this year's BTC bubble, and now I have to pay taxes on the "realized" gains at the peak bubble prices even though I didn't really cash out. My cost basis is simply much higher now. Since I don't have extra cash laying around to pay for those gains, I'll have to pay out of my BTC, cutting my holdings roughly in half. Painful.

Sorry, but to me this seemed like a poorly written and poorly explained article. Some arguments and claims were non sequitur.
Edit 1: non sequitur example:


A decentralized network, by definition, does not suffer from a single point of failure risk.
Edit 2: another non sequitur:


A description of a topology is not a reason for something that must be done - it's just a definition and I fail to see how its used as a motivation that something must be done. How about: to keep a network in this topology (motivation) a specific ratio ... must be maintained (action).
Edit 3: poor explanation example:


Some will also **be distributed**? How? By naturally emergent pattern? By a central network planner? By a consensus algorithm? Note that the explanation is not provided before or after this statement. Later in the article there's some information about an "autopilot" which would be in charge of maintaining the topology. Connecting the dots, so to speak, seems to clarify some of the confusion, but it's not clearly stated so we're left just guessing and assuming. Also, autopilot concept is very light on details. 
Edit 4: lack of support for key points:


As this is one of the few main points on which the whole premise of the article stands, a more detailed explanation or at least a relevant reference would help here.  
Edit 5: non sequitur:


I fail to see how one follows from the other without some explanation. If I could use an analogy, it's a bit like saying: giant central ISPs would not form because they could become giant monopolies and become a bandwidth and innovation bottleneck for the network and users would be overcharged as they'd have very limited choices.   
Edit 6: poor explanation:


The last part seems to come out of nowhere. I don't understand what "loading blocks but not saving them" means without context.  
Edit 7: my remarks:
The main interesting point in this article (imo), although very incoherently explained, is the idea of steering network topology towards a more optimal one by having nodes voluntarily opt in and give up some or all of the decision making on who to establish payment channels with to some service-like system/entity in charge of maintaining such topology.

Move coins to your own address. After the fork, split the coins. Make sure you're doing this securely, although don't get too paranoid. Sounds like you're just beginning to do your research. Expect to spend many hours. Good luck. My advice is to practice with small amounts when you're not confident in your process yet.

Specialized hardware will always be more efficient than general purpose hardware. Of course the factor by how much more efficient can be reduced by clever PoWs, but I don't think it can be eliminated. The reason we have generalised hardware is due to high upfront cost of developing specialized hardware AND due to the fact that specialized hardware can't adapt to new requirements. If we want to prevent specialized hardware from being developed to crunch PoW problems, we need to make a PoW system which changes every once in a while in a way that breaks specialized hardware, but still works on the same generalized hardware.

Joining the discussion... my 2 cents. Yes, more capacity means more throughput means lower fees, but also means increased centralization and decreased security. The debate should revolve around how much centralization is too much centralization. It's near impossible for everyone to agree where to draw the exact line, just like it's impossible for everyone to agree at what temperature water transitions from being considered cold to being considered hot. It's a nuanced topic, but in my opinion, it's the key aspect of bitcoin that matters in the end. Bitcoin has different value propositions to different people. Each group wants to maximize the value proposition they value the most. Value proposition that appeals the most to me personally is in having trust in the system to store and transfer non-negligible amounts of value while maintaining extreme levels of censorship and attack resistance. I believe many users highly value this end-goal too and that's why many users, especially the ones that took the time to learn and understand "the point" of bitcoin's origin in the first place, support a vision that's closer aligned with current development. Businesses, on the other hand, see a very different value proposition. They can't make money off of the long-term store-of-value aspect of bitcoin, at least, not nearly as much. It makes sense that they're perfectly fine taking a shorter term view, sacrificing decentralization, maximizing throughput, getting as many users and use cases on the chain as they can as fast as possible, etc. All these goals are fine, but not, IMO, at the cost of sacrificing/crippling the greater goals of maximizing censorship/attack-resistance and, to a lesser degree, improving privacy.

I think you may have misinterpreted me. My bad. I was replying to just the following claim:


My explanation is unrelated to the lightning network, or at least that was my intention. Let me try to explain one more time what I'm trying to get across. I'll just go with an example in the hopes that clarify that it has nothing to do with LN but with transaction composition (known as "coin selection").
Suppose the following:
I own the following UTXOs: 8 mBTC, 5 mBTC, 0.7 mBTC, 0.2 mBTC, and 0.14 mBTC. I want to send someone 6 mBTC. Fee to spend a UTXO is 0.009 mBTC. Cost to create a UTXO is 0.011 (0.002 fee to create the output + 0.009 future fee to spend). There are two options for composing a transaction.
Option A: use 8 mBTC to pay 6 mBTC + change output of 1.987 mBTC + 0.013 mBTC fee.
Option B: use 5 mBTC + 0.7 mBTC + 0.2 mBTC + 0.14 mBTC to pay 6 mBTC + 0.04 mBTC fee, without producing a change output.
You can see that option A increases the UTXO set by 1, while option B decreases the UTXO set by 3.
Now, in a case where each inputs needs its own signature (current situation), option A is preferred, as it costs 0.022 (0.013 + 0.009 future spending cost of the change output), while option B costs 0.04.
In a case where all inputs can use one combined signature, option B may be preferred, as option A costs stay the same, while option B costs may be lower. Let's assume input cost in this case is 0.008 mBTC + N times 0.001 mBTC, where N is the number of inputs. This gives us option B cost at 0.014. This is compared to 0.022 for option A.
I hope this illustrates what I was trying to say. Basically, selecting an exact match without producing a change output is cheaper for the user and produces less new UTXOs, and Schnorr signatures, by reducing the cost many input transactions, when combined with smart coin selection algorithms, increases the amount of eligible cost-efficient input combinations, thus resulting in more such transactions.

Great news for many supporters of BTC. While skimming through the FAQ, I came across this one:




This made me realize that, duh, transaction volume is likely to be significantly lower around the time of the fork. This should translate to much lower fees. If anyone is looking to consolidate some accounts, or even to just upgrade to segwit accounts for cheaper spending later, this might be a great opportunity.

You'd be sending to your own accounts. Replay attack is only a concern if you're sending coins to someone else who you don't fully trust.

Pumping unrelated altcoins is not the same as discussing the future course of bitcoin. Encouraging splits and hard-forks of Bitcoin should be frowned upon, I agree, because ideally we'd like to always aim for reaching a consensus, but that process is stifled too early with some of the bans (disclosure - I'm not very familiar with most ban cases and they might well be legit, but over time I'm getting a feeling they might be a bit too strict for my own personal preference).

Sorry, I wasn't addressing mining centralization with that suggestion. I was just saying that if we were to create something new, MimbleWimble type of blockchain would be a great start. I guess it helps reducing centralization indirectly by being more efficient in terms of blockchain size growth.
Having said that, if you're looking for suggestions on how to reduce mining centralization, I have some thoughts. One aspect of centralization, at least currently, is ASICs. Going with a different PoW only defers the inevitable. Once it's worth doing, investment in ASICs becomes worthwhile regardless of the kind of PoW used. The main weakness of this centralization is that it takes a lot of upfront investment and time. If PoW was designed to be more dynamic, where it could change frequently in such a way that it would be impossible for specialized ASICs to be developed, it could possibly be kept in the realm of general purpose CPUs and/or GPUs. General purpose CPUs and GPUs are a lot more decentralized so if it's possible to have a dynamic PoW system which makes ASICs near impossible to be implemented in time, it might be an idea worth exploring.

Well, by itself, it's not a coin. However, there's a project called Grin which is a coin with MimbleWimble at its core.
The reason the project started is primarily because it can't be integrated into Bitcoin. Devs are sympathetic to Bitcoin and I'm almost certain that a decent amount of Bitcoin devs overlap with Grin devs. This means that the project is likely to be following Bitcoin's footsteps in many aspects, while improving things based on hindsight and insight learned from Bitcoin's history. It does not hit any marks yet in OP's list, but at least it seems very compatible with those points from where it's at now and from where it's aiming.

Did some of my own "napkin" calcs.
Standard US printing page fits 6k characters in 8pt Courier font with 1" margins or 3k in 12pt size [source](
Typical options to encode the data range from 1 to 6 bits per character (e.g. ones and zeroes (1 bit), hex (4 bits), base58 (almost 6 bits)).
Let's say we want to minimize papers while maintaining readability, so we use an alphanumeric encoding of 5 bits per character, an 8pt fixed length font (Courier or similar), and 0.5“ margins. This gives us almost 40k bits per page side. Let's make it double sided printing - 80k bits per page or 10KB per page. So a meg is 100-page book.
Blockchain size is what nowadays? 150GB? To print the current blockchain, we'd need about 15 million pages. Standard thickness paper is about 3.5" per 1k pages, so we're looking at a single stack at a height of about 4.4k feet or 0.82 miles or 1.33 km.

I think so. Keep your bitcoins in an address which you can spend any time but another party can only spend after some time (timelocked). Let's say about year. Then all you have to do is transfer it about once a year, before timelock expires, to a new address with the same locking script. Rinse and repeat. Or did you have something else in mind?

Sorry to interrupt, but this conversation is too hilarious to pass up. I don't want to be rude or stir more shit up. Please don't take my comments negatively. Frogolocalypse is right to point out where you're wrong or have a misunderstanding - and you do. Neither he claims, nor I will, that LN is the ultimate and final scaling solution with infinite scalability; however, LN does allow to scale bitcoin transactions very significantly. If you've already made up your mind, so be it, but I strongly suggest you research this technology (LN) more and try to understand better why it has the potential it has. At least acknowledge the fact that many smart people see the potential and are advocating for it because of that.
