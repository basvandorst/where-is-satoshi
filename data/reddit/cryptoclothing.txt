Looks like a large to me. My experience is that larges fit best for 180-200 lbs., medium &lt; 180 lbs. Xl &gt; 200 lbs.

No, it doesn't. Things like a career and an education do though! Simple mock ups like those on my store provide any potential customer a general idea as to the product they'll receive. I just threw up the store a month ago. If you are interested in seeing what I can offer check back every once in a while

Yeah sure! Are you referring to the glitter gold or the metallic gold one? Also which color shirt and size?Once you let me know that info, I'll create the listing for you and you can buy it through my shop.

Don't mean to steal steam from the first guy, but I also am a graphic designer. Also a screen printer if that helps.

I will again soon. There are ways to do it. With Bitcoin going up, the return policy was a jip to the customer so I pulled out of accepting Bitcoin. Once one of the 4 big cryptos show less volatility I'll use those one or two as my main crypto payment method. Never burn the customer! Im trying to keep the greed out of crypto!

They are slightly slim fit compared to a regular shirt, like a gildan 2000.  I am a large and they fit a little smaller on me. If you're a large, an xl would fit normally and shrink only a little after a wash.
