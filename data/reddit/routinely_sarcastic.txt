"Millennials" generally start with the ones that turned 18 in 2000, so the first group were born in 1982, and the oldest are 36 now.
"Generation Z" is the next generation which is more mid-90s as their first birth years, and they weren't in the workforce for the 2008 recession.

Its more that the price of bitcoin has really been in tether for awhile now because all the liquidity in the market has been mostly tether.
7800 / 6300 = 1.23
1 / 1.23 = 0.81
So if tether crashes to $0.81 then bitcoin priced in tether rises by 23%.  Bitcoin isn't actually gaining or losing in value right now, tether is just crashing (you're measuring each bitcoin in a shorter yardstick of tether).
EDIT: the kraken price is more reasonable since bitfinex is an outlier because the panic there is worse.  6820 / 6200 = 1.10, 1/1.0 = $0.90.  The midpoint of those two values is the $.85 that USDTUSD hit.

 : "demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years [....] Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe are widely credited with naming the millennials.[1] They coined the term in 1987, around the time children born in 1982 were entering preschool, and the media were first identifying their prospective link to the new millennium as the high school graduating class of 2000."
 "There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends, but demographers and researchers typically use the mid-1990s to mid-2000s as starting birth years. Presently, there is little consensus regarding ending birth years."

After the volatility last night everyone with any shred of a brain has reset where their automatic buy and sell orders are.  The more intelligent ones stepped back from the market a few days ago as tether started to drift downwards.  The remaining ones aren't going to be enough to stop the market direction and are just going to get annihilated.

The poor people don't save any money, they spend it.  So they're buying bread 100 years later with their wages from earlier that week, not from the money they stashed away 100 years earlier.  The cost of bread and the amount of their wages are both indexed to inflation.
Inflation is a tax on rich people and rich dynasties shoving currency under the mattress, which forces them to invest and evade inflation.  That's the point.  Use it or lose it.

You need over 1.2 million dollars of assets on your balance sheet to offset that, and the risk of those assets needs to be assessed and audited.  And you don't get to print that money, you don't get a license to counterfeit money, you have to get loans from banks higher up the food chain.
