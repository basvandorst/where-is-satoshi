The mere presence of *any* software on a system increases its attack surface. Do you think the Ruby, Python, PHP interpreters are somehow more secure than the JVM? Or native code? Absolutely not. The reason hackers focus on the JVM, and the reason we have seen exploits against it, is that it is one of the few ways that browsers (previously, anyway) will automatically download and run remote code. This is now recognized as a bad trade-off, as there are few if any legitimate sites that need to run Java in the browser. So it is prudent to disable Java in the browser.
It's silly to disparage an entire platform in this way. Java is one of the most popular development platforms and is widely and securely used by huge numbers of companies and individual developers. Just like any other language, including native code, you should be careful about what you download and run.

Great post. You beat me to it.

It is possible to move "large" amount of BTC on existing exchange, where "large" is a few hundred BTC. Any more than that and you're gonna move the market. Institutions would want to move millions or tens of millions in a single transaction if they could. SecondMarket could be a way for big investors to move large amounts of BTC without making waves in the markets us minnows swim in.

Me too. Done about 10 purchases on Coinbase from my Capitol One 360 in the past 6 months, no problems. Not small amounts, either.
Just be aware they only allow 6 ACH per month for free.

Actually the phrase "I really like to pet my cat" will get cracked quickly by a knowledgeable attacker doing an offline attack. Essentially any phase that shows up anywhere on the Internet will make it into a script/dictionary feeding a password cracker:

What he said is much more worrying than that. He said that protocol development has essentially halted due to "social" issues. So many people are involved in discussions around protocol changes that even minor changes that ought not be controversial devolve into flame wars and nothing gets done. He said Gavin is the only one working on the protocol, and he's focused on floating fees (IMO not the most important issue facing bitcoin).

Right, and since there are only 8 bitcoin icons on the map, which presumably means connections to the bitcoin network, OP's client is **not** a full client.
I recently spun up an EC2 instance to run the full client, and it has 50 connections:
    bitcoind:~/.bitcoin$ bitcoind getinfo
    {
        "version" : 90100,
        "protocolversion" : 70002,
        "walletversion" : 60000,
        "balance" : 0.00000000,
        "blocks" : 308010, 
        "timeoffset" : -3,
        "connections" : 50,
        "proxy" : "",
        "difficulty" : 13462580114.52533913,
        "testnet" : false,
        "keypoololdest" : 1403427425,
        "keypoolsize" : 101,
        "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,
        "errors" : ""
    }
Also, it's only really helpful to run a full node if you have decent upload bandwidth.
edit: my ec2 instance uploads about 4GB per day to the network, to give you an idea of the upstream requirements.

I've done conversions from RMB + wire transfers in excess of $20k USD before at a traditional mainland bank. The only catch is you need to get proof from the tax bureau that you earned and paid taxes on that amount of RMB, so you can't do it indefinitely. But if you really wanted to do I believe banks in Hong Kong do not have these sending restrictions and can trade in RMB.

Cool! Don't make it out to WDK much, but I'll drop a line :)

 Why not? Retailers who accept credit cards are already the ones who take the loss when they charge a fraudulent card.

I'm an expat living in China. My expenses are in RMB. Also it's not as hard for me as a foreigner to convert it back to USD.

I'm doing the opposite, buying in dollars and selling in RMB. Moved 3 bitcoins, pocketed $643 in arbitrage profit.

The picture is not proof, it's just the public address that everyone has. Actually Bitcoin has a much better way to prove you are the Bitcoin sign guy. Sign a message like "The Bitcoinsignguy reddit account belongs to me" with the private key belonging to that address. The bitcoin-qt client has this functionality built-in, simply select the address and click the "sign message" button.

I'm a westerner live in Beijing. Based on the time of your post and the local time here, I'd guess most posters so far are NOT living in China. :) 
If you mean retailers accepting bitcoin, I've never seen it (then again, I haven't seen it on my frequent trips back to the states, either). Some online sites accept it, but it's not clear how popular that is.
As some have pointed out in this subreddit and this thread, China has strict capital controls and few options for profitably saving or investing. Until now, most people wealthy enough to want to invest have done so by purchasing second, third, and fourth homes, leading to rampant urban house price inflation, as well as policies to restrict purchases of second homes: [Economist article from this week]( 
Bitcoin offers Chinese both a way around capital controls and a vehicle for saving, which explains the recent surge in popularity. Nearly all of my Chinese coworkers at the tech company I work at have heard of bitcoin; I don't know how that compares to the US today. Chinese are famous for piling in on things, so I'm not surprised to see the value of bitcoin driven up so high so quickly from Chinese demand. It has actually created some excellent arbitrage opportunities that I've been able to take advantage of :)
TL;DR: No one is using it for retail commerce yet, and the interest up to this point is a mix of speculation and leveraging the bitcoin network to move currency outside the country without using the banking system (which I understand is one of the core purposes of bitcoin).
