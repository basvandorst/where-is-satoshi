There is no escrow, and they recently changed the 2 of 3 multisig to 2 of 2. Short version, both parties need to agree to final payout or funds are lost.

You don't need to spoof a transaction though. Once someone uses their card on a merchants terminal they have what they need to run another transaction if they want. (Of course it would be super obvious if someone checked their bank statements and that merchant would be in the shit.) There is also something called a continuous payment authority which allows a merchant to debit you whatever and whenever they want, but you should be informed before signing up to that (EG. Netflix).
@_date: 2019-08-23 20:53:45
It doesn't even really qualify as an attack in the sense you're thinking. The transaction won't be verified by pin but it will still go through. When you take a transaction 2 receipts are printed. The cardholder one only has the last 4 digits of the card number on it. The merchants copy has the full card number and the expiry date. You can type these in to the terminal and then it will ask if the cardholder is present, you say yes and it prints out a receipt for them to sign, it asks you to check the signature and you say yes. The transaction goes through, it doesn't require the security code from the back of the card (which is not on the receipt). If you do a normal cardholder not present transaction you need the security code (although I think some businesses can put it through without), you don't need the correct billing address details either way, though it will warn you if they are wrong.
I know this works because we accidentally charged someone 7.50 instead of 75, we ran the rest through after he left once we found out. I think you can opt to have transactions verified by signature disabled, but it's on by default for most cards (or how else would they work in foreign countries which don't have chip and pin). Of the times when I've actually taken signature transactions (usually refunds) most people's cards are unsigned anyway.

It's possible he hasn't. I've never paid any kind of fee to my bank. UK banks only charge consumers for things like overdrafts. (UK to UK) Transfers, cheques, withdrawals are all free.

The point the poster and I are making is that if the wallet is closed source you are taking it on faith alone that no one else has access to the keys. It's not nonsense, it's as true as can be.
@_date: 2019-08-30 17:57:55
It's not dumb, not having control of your private keys is dumb. Open-source wallets verified by the community are an acceptable compromise that don't require you to write a usable wallet yourself.

How's it obsolete if it works on most cards today. I bet it works on your card and if you think it won't post the number and expiry date, I literally have it for every customer who's used their chip and pin card at my shop (as well as contactless) so I'm a pretty trustworthy guy.

Reddit admins have edited user comments before.
@_date: 2019-08-23 21:32:42
Parent comment said the card was the private key metaphorically and that when you do a transaction you give the details to the merchant (correct). You said this was wrong because chip and pin has made this obsolete, I pointed out how this is not true, because even if you do a chip and pin transaction you have given over the details needed to make another transaction to the merchant, making the parent comment still correct, and certainly not misinformation which you accused it of being.
Even if chip and pin was required everywhere always and if card details weren't automatically printed onto merchant receipts it would still be relatively easy (if desired) for someone who works in a shop to get enough details from your card to make online transactions (though there are moves towards 2FA for cards online, these are still not even the majority so it's far from being obsolete)
I feel bitcoin transactions at this point in time are more secure. As long as you're as careful with it as you would be with cash (which is far more careful than people are with a card)

Generally speaking miners switch off when the price is too low for them to mine profitably, they more come online as the price rises making mining more profitable for more people.
There are a small number of stupid people here who mine unprofitably because they are speculating on a future price increase, these people are very, very stupid, but unfortunately believe they are very, very clever. However if they were so clever they would realise the money they're losing mining could have been spent on buying bitcoin directly if their goal was speculating! You should ignore these people, but they will say the same about me. Do your own research, don't be a fool.

Just wondering if you'd ever heard of penny stocks before. They have a long history of being high risk/low return investments.
"holy shit, I bought $400 when it was only $0.32 "
You should add in the money you lost on the other coins, factor in inflation and see if the profit over 5-10 years is as high. Then, when you have the real ROI, wonder if there were perhaps better investments you could have made with the money (any interest you paid on credit cards, car finance, any borrowing at all really, during this time would be an obvious one). After factoring in the opportunity cost is your lucky scenario really that great? (Assuming you manage to sell at the right time).
@_date: 2019-10-13 12:38:08
The first thing you should do is head over to r/personalfinance, as the basic advice there such as avoiding and managing debt and making sure you have enough cash to cover potential emergencies, as well as saving for retirement is a guaranteed profit. Any potential investments you make are what is known as speculative (you can't know the outcome). Bitcoin is what would be called an extremely speculative investment and should only be bought as an investment by people who are financially stable, have a suitable retirement plan (buying bitcoin is not a suitable retirement plan) and have disposable income they can risk 100% of.

No mate, you're struggling to understand simple concepts that I grasped years ago about bitcoin and mining (which was my primary interest) I've explained them as simply as I can. If you take anything away from this conversation it should be 2 things.
1. An increase in miners does not predict an increase in value
2. Mining at a loss is the same thing as buying above market rate
If you are interested in mining yourself you should pay attention to number 2 especially, as there are very few miners in the world who can mine profitably when all is said and done, since you are competing with Asian chip manufacturers with multi million dollar factories making chips not available to anyone else.

I'll be willing to attempt to recover for 10%. Macbook air is SSD and some of the SSDs had bad firmware meaning data is still present drive just cannot be read through normal methods. You'd know if it was SSD problem as your mac would still turn on, just display a folder icon with a ? If these are not your symptoms something else is wrong with your computer.
Worst case scenario is SSD was formatted and TRIM command run, this would be for all intents and purposes irrecoverable, anything else there's some chance.

Again you are wrong and it's getting a little bit frustrating. The BTC price that it is profitable to mine at is relative to each miner, doesn't change anything I said now does it? In fact it supports the whole economy of mining that I've been explaining. I'm sorry I'm not communicating clearly enough for you.

Bitcoin cash is a fork of bitcoin. Private keys are compatible. The private key coinbase would have used to spend from the bitcoin wallet will also work to spend from the same address on bcash network. Funds are recoverable by whoever possesses the private key (which sounds like coinbase).
Your funds are probably 'irrecoverable' because they already stole them, you'd be able to see if they moved them on a block explorer (caveat: they may have moved as part of normal operations)

This is a misunderstanding on how probability works. The next block is always 10 minutes away (on average) This is like you saying that the chances of flipping a heads on a coin increases the more times you flip tails in a row. The chances of finding a block don't increase because it has been a long time since the last.
@_date: 2019-09-04 11:27:49
It is a data point of no value as all it means is the next block was found quicker than normal. If this was happening consistently the difficulty would be raised and average time to confirm would go back to an average of 10 mins, if you don't understand this you've missed one of the fundamental basics of bitcoin.
It was just as likely to take 16mins from when you sent the transaction to confirm. The average time it takes for 1 confirmation when you send a transaction is always 10 mins. You may as well have said it only took 2 seconds, because blocks have been found that close together before.
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:58:04
Arguments about the nature of fiat money notwithstanding; things like credit cards, debit cards, cheques and even bank transfers could be considered L2 and L3 solutions to the cash base layer. While cash can be exchanged freely face to face (in manageable amounts) there is no 'base' solution for transferring it across distance that even compares to the speed and cost of a bitcoin transaction. So I agree, higher level solutions are probably the way forward. Ideally decentralized in a way that will hopefully be conceived by people far more intelligent than myself.

Who said shut it down. Just needs to be banned in like 5 countries and it will lose 99% of its value. The fact it went above $10 in the first place was widely recognised at the time as only supported by speculators. No legal trades = return to true value.

People who mine for anonymity are 2 things.
1. Negligible
2. Misguided
Someone who could mine a non-negligible amount of BTC has been deanonymized already by being one of the few organisations in the world capable of doing so. Requiring expensive equipment manufactured by only a few companies worldwide. There are far better ways of achieving anonymous coins that don't require a ludicrous upfront investment. It also isn't bullish for bitcoin, which is my point.
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:21:18
Look it's very simple.
All I am saying is that an increase or decrease in hashrate can not be used to predict an increase or decrease in the value of bitcoin. It happens the other way around. This is self evident as because of the economics of mining if ROI decreases miners will shut down, whereas an increase in value makes mining profitable for more potential miners. We see this effect across every POW blockchain in existence.
What would have to be true for hashrate to predict price? Let's ignore the fact unprofitable miners could just buy bitcoin directly if they are speculating on an increase in value, instead of mining at a loss for less bitcoins for reasons only clear to you:
These miners you say that have future economic benefits would have to have superior knowledge to the rest of the market for their additional hashrate to be used as a predictor in an increase in the value of bitcoin. Why do you think they do? This is the claim that requires evidence, this is why I used the strong language of my original post to describe this 'hypothesis' as delusional.

Hi I discussed this briefly with you in PMs. It seems to me that if you use the devs check to see if your node currently has any invalid channels open, as well as making sure that your node is up to date you are protected from the vulnerability.

Right so you don't disagree with me on the only point I was trying to make, instead you take umbrage with the evidence I used to support my position. Namely you seem to be suggesting that a certain percentage of people wanting to speculate on bitcoin will choose to mine it even at a loss instead of just buying it. Yeah, possibly I guess. So what? Those people are misguided. I doubt these are the ones who possess superior market knowledge since they're making such a fundamental mistake. Do you not understand that mining at a loss = paying above market price after initially paying a huge upfront cost?
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:03:31
Because you can't rely on an unlikely 4 minute confirmation time. It is better to assume it will take an average of ten minutes (which it will) either that is quick enough or it isn't, but saying that it is quick because it could take 4 minutes (or even 2 seconds) is nonsensical.

As mentioned to actually receive bitcoins on the lightning network someone will either have to open a channel to you (by creating an on chain transaction) or you will have to send some through one of your channels to be able to receive up to an equal amount back (while the channel remains open). Of course technically you received stickers.

Why? Compliance costs them money and customers, besides, banks love a bit of money laundering. It just has to be worth the punishment, aka 0.5% of your $100 transaction isn't worth their ability to trade being suspended.
@_date: 2019-09-28 01:16:18
The concerning thing to me about this is due to the nature of the lightning network bugs like this are especially damaging. If at any point your node accepts an invalid payment then your funds are liable to be lost just by routing other peoples transactions through your node (which happens practically without the user's control). This could come back in the future in the form of an as of yet undiscovered (or not yet implemented) invalid transaction bug.

Banks have a legal obligation to follow anti money laundering laws, they wouldn't do it if they didn't have to.
I have to do the same thing in the UK for some of the activities the company I work for participates in, our AML laws are hilariously vague with what you're actually required to do though, so everyone just pretty much does it to cover their arse.

The problem with your argument is that there are very, very few people who mine for the purposes of acquiring bitcoin. It's an irrational action as profitable mining today requires a large initial investment and almost impossible to achieve conditions. If someone was speculating on an increase in price they would be better served to buy bitcoins directly, rather than set up a mining operation that is guaranteed to be less economical than the fabricators can achieve.
You have also left out the mechanism where an individual deciding to invest in mining equipment causes the bitcoin price to rise? Which is your argument if you believe price follows hashrate rather than the obvious inverse.
Also I don't buy bitcoin anymore, I bought (and mined) enough when they were at $3 each, I mostly concern myself with exchanging now, I like buying and selling at a profit with every trade I make.
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:39:24

@_date: 2019-09-12 21:00:54
The methodology is legitimate, there are altcoins that are still profitable to mine with GPU (even cpu) with cheap electricity, you can then sell these coins for BTC (well you're actually gonna sell for fiat unless your elec. company accepts crypto). Vertcoin is nowhere near the most efficient way of doing this. As the cards that perform best with it's algo are more efficient on XMR (if you go Vega) or ethash (nvidia). These are probably the most profitable hash algo's to GPU mine right now. XMR can even be profitable with an efficient enough CPU and low elec. prices.
Also this person is in Serbia, which I believe has a reputation for being kinda cold. If the heat generated by mining is useful rather than waste this raises your profitability. Buying those GPUs just to mine is probably not worth it though, hard to guarantee ROI before the next gen is out and difficulty goes up.
@_date: 2019-09-05 08:51:44

Miners don't try solutions in the same order and there is not only one possible solution so they are not sequentially approaching a solution like you're suggesting.
Also as incoming transactions change the merkle root it also changes the hash. Previously incorrect nonces could be a valid solution so what you're saying doesn't apply at all, since there are an infinite number of solutions, and the service string is constantly changing (merkle root + timestamp) I was correct when I stated that blocks are always 10 mins away. You made me doubt myself for a second!

Ready and waiting for that one mate, too predictable. Drugs get you high, people like drugs, people are addicted to drugs. Drugs can only be liquidated through illegal means and people do not acquire drugs as an asset, they liquidate or use them as soon as possible. Not comparable to a crypto ban, I would however like the drugs that you have been smoking if you think locking out nearly the entire current bitcoin market would not tank the price.
Thought experiment my dude. Tonight Donald Trump announces that all trading in Bitcoins becomes illegal on the 1st November 2019 and no American bank/payment processor/exchange can process crypto related transactions without being subject to severe penalties under Anti Terrorism and money laundering laws, but you are free to cash out any coins you currently own up until that point.

Seems a strange idea to me. I don't think we're going to agree on much. I think you're overestimating just how many people would be so dedicated to the bitcoin cause (rather than a speculative investment) to implement the significant underground infrastructure that would be required to sustain a liquid blackmarket.
How about you ask a few random people you meet how to buy and use bitcoin and while you do this remember it's currently legal?
Another point I might make is to remember why I brought this up. As one of the (multiple) reasons why bitcoin is a riskier investment than a traditional portfolio. Your theory would require you to only deal with people already willing to break the law, AKA more likely to scam or rob you. Does that sound like a secure investment?
@_date: 2019-09-12 21:59:06
In the case that 2% of their BTC was stolen they would be able to cover it and might choose to do so to continue operating.
The risk of a significant amount of BTC being stolen in hack/inside job is non-negligible and I strongly doubt they would be able to cover large losses. Most likely fold the company and you will get sweet FA
