Man, if I had a bitcoin for every time someone came on this sub ranting and pointing wild fingers at Coinbase, only to have the facts respectfully and courteously displayed to the entire community and show that it was either a) a misunderstanding or b) partially the accuser's fault...i'd have a lot of Bitcoins.
In fact, considering the amount of foundless finger wagging and accusations in their direction (not to mention the blind-faith jumping-on-the-band-wagon of everyone else), i'm surprised they still pay any attention to this community at all.
@_date: 2015-12-22 09:15:47
Even if they don't, there's still a valuable take-away from all this: just because the complainer is 'one of us' (i.e. a redditor), and *appear* to have a legit complaint, they are still more than capable of leaving out certain key data which embellish the 'wrongfulness' of the situation.
In other words: let's do our due diligence before judging and jumping in on the hive mentality...especially when it comes to complaints about a very reputable member of the community such as Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-12-22 09:13:16


Let's bear in mind that, according to Coinbase, there were **42** days in which the researcher didn't respond. Then a couple weeks go by and they go to Reddit?

The Belarusian Ruble has always undergone hyperinflation. The only protection that the citizens had from the poorly-managed economy was to buy foreign currency. 
The government has just instituted a +30% tax on any foreign currency bought.
It is now more expensive to protect yourself from hyper-inflation than it is to simply let your money lose its value.
Does anyone have a link to a simple "What is Bitcoin" explanation video in Russian?

Now I have to look into it, because someone mentioned that adding with a credit card costs 3%, but to test it out, i used the debit card that i get paid through here in Minsk. I bought $20.00 worth of BTC and sent it to my address at coinbase.
Give it a shot--let me know if you have anymore questions, but im pretty certain there are more knowledgeable souls on here than me.

Evidence 3: a genuine shill would most likely not add disrepute by broadcasting that he posts in a disreputable subreddit
Evidence 4: It took me a long time to respond to most of the comments in this thread, implying that I have a life outside of shilling
Evidence 5: Who cares? My life, the internet, and bitcoin will continue--completely unaffected--with or without your belief.

Yes, but BTC companies that behave like banks is the only way that BTC is going to seem legit in the eyes of the government and not end up getting regulated to death, which is necessary if you want to ultimately obtain freedom from government-backed banking.
Let the govt willingly grant you freedom before you seize all control. After all, that's how they did it.

Some people believe it is right to steal if they perceive no one to get hurt. Some people believe that it is right to murder if "the person deserves it". Some people believe that it is right to lie or cheat if it results in their success. 
This is why laws exist. Because without them, people will do what they believe is right. "What people believe is right"--is often not right.

Well actually, i was also a liberal arts guy: anthropology, but now I work in tech. There are few enough foreigners (specifically in Minsk) where you can leverage your native English to be pretty useful in a lot of fields--so it gives you a lot of opportunities that you might not otherwise have. I've learned so much about tech and my work that I'm confident I'll be able to find a good job when I get back to the States.
I first came to Belarus as a student, and then through connections i landed my first job in the marketing dept at a tech company, then expressed interest in moving beyond that. 
It is definitely much easier for the math/science field guys, that's for sure. And I actually regret not doing a STEM major (thinking about actually going back to school for STEM), because you actually graduate with a tangible skill.

if WU was smart, they would capitalize on bitcoin and offer BTC *insured* transfer services. They could charge half their normal rate and still make a tremendous profit.
As BTC picks up, WU will be on the decline anyway: the way Blockbuster went with Netflix. But they'd be stupid not to take as much as they could as it happens. 
99% of the public is still very much skeptical (if not completely ignorant) of bitcoin, WU offering their own services at half the rate would make more profit for them and make them look like a forward-thinking, customer-first kind of company.

It seems to me that decentralization as we have seen it hasn't resulted in the removal of third parties as much as it has enabled the growth of many more third parties--creating more competition, which in turn benefits the consumer. 
Take publishing: Amazon is a third party that has "decentralized" publishing. Anyone can publish a book now and get it out to their target audience, even though it's through a trusted 3rd party.
Decentralization will change things in that we will have more, better-trusted third parties sprouting up.

Not all thieves do. And the ones that do--well, there are many reasons for it. For example: the path of least resistance. If someone doesn't believe they're being stolen from, then they're less likely to fight the thief. Or maybe said thief doesn't believe it's wrong, but knows that others will. Easier.

Because has trusted everybody with half-a-brain who decides to start something 'innovative' with Bitcoin, only to be shocked and horrified when a sudden 'hack' makes all their bitcoin disappear. Coinbase, on the other hand, is probably the only organization/company associated with BTC that has shown any level of professionalism, organizational strength, and competence in helping people "be their own bank."
To reiterate:


Because the whole 'trustless system' is actually non-existent and if you want Bitcoin to take off with the masses, you need to hand it over its governance to an organization that has not time-and-again been proven to be full of scammers (looking at you Bitcoin Foundation).

I think the question that has failed to ask is: "Do people actually *want* to be their own bank?" I submit that they don't: that's why the BTC community has been so susceptible to scams over the years. That's why all it takes is the mysterious and purposely vague claim of a 'hack' and poof--the company is gone in a puff of smoke.
If you want the masses to adopt bitcoin, then people will need (read "want") an organization that can guarantee them protection from their own stupidity (for example accidentally sending 10 BTC to a donation address). They want safety. They want regulation. They want to know that they won't get scammed or have their money stolen every time they make a transaction. 
Coinbase is the organization that can provide that.

I beg to differ on this. Bitcoin wants mass adoption--it's the only way the protocol will ever reach it's potential. The only way it will ever reach true decentralization is when everyone uses it. That won't happen unless it's made palatable first; when people can grasp it, then they'll use it. Once it's being used by everyone, people will eventually wake up to the power they really have.
Baby steps.

People generally live quite comfortably here, and without the mountain of debt that the majority of Americans have.

Partially for the same reason I don't trust BTC news from sources with "coin" in the name--but also because I've spent about two weekends a month in Kiev for the past year, and I have yet to meet anyone "escaping from the banks" in Bitcoin.
I was, however, pleasantly surprised to stumble upon a Bitcoin Embassy relatively close to the downtown.

I think it should work just like Amazon, of course because people are dealing in online cash, you'll want to hold the funds in a sort of escrow fashion for a very limited amount of time to mitigate scamming. 
Then, after you've gathered a huge user base and accumulated a few tens of thousands of bitcoins, change the website to "under maintenance" pages, shut down automatic withdrawals, announce a "hack" and celebrate your new found riches by swimming in a Mojito Pool on a tropical island surrounded by beautiful, scantily clad women.
Then log onto and watch everyone talk about how stupid your customers were for trusting a third party with any of their money.

2 years in minimum security with Internet access.
* Blog with loads of followers (where he accepts BTC donations) 
* twitter gathering more followers  (where he accepts BTC donations)
* no doubt a book (several) when he gets out and possibly while he's in (where he will accept cash, paypal, and BTC 'donations')
* a comfy stash of BTC sitting around somewhere with nothing to do over the next two years but appreciate in value
Well I see 2 years of R&amp;R followed by a big pile of money.
I'm starting to think I should get convicted of a financial crime involving bitcoins.

And you would know how? You read an article on the Internet? "Blatantly lying" said the guy who clearly doesn't know sh*t of what he's talking about.

1. The cost of living is extraordinarily cheap here.
2. Calculating "average income" here is beyond difficult seeing as about 65% of individuals make their living off the books, peddling contraband (which is amazingly lucrative), or through straight-out bribery. FYI: people aren't mentioning those sources of income in their tax filings.
Also: "More money" does not equal "richer," especially when you take into account cost-of-living, ownership vs. credit, and all that other hullabaloo.

This looks amazing, and I want it to succeed. BUT: how will Open Bazaar be handling fraud? 
Consumer A makes the order, but the store never ships. It's bitcoin, so no refunds--now what? What recourse does Consumer A actually have to get their money back? Sure they can leave a bad review, maybe ban that particular store, but can they ever get their money back?

Ukraine may be poor compared to America, but Ukrainians are not poor compared to Americans. And I don't step foot in "the wealthiest districts..." of anywhere.

The Northern Caucasus, like Chechnya and Dagistan are part of Russia. The southern Caucasus--like Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia, are not--although the Kremlin might like to pretend otherwise.


Just forget it. This is really not an argument worth having.

My immediate reaction whenever I see any 'news' source that has "coin" somewhere in the title is that it's purely propaganda and click bait.

1. I don't hang out in "the center of Kiev". And I have been to places in Ukraine that won't even appear on a map--my original statement still applies.
2. This is not England, and comments like yours only demonstrate that you clearly have no idea what it is like here. A country may be 'poor' because their funds are public funds are poorly managed, but that doesn't mean the people are. Nor does it even imply that the majority of people are.

Probably because he, like many bitcoiners, is more interested in getting rich than about "changing the world with crypto currency.

read user names before you argue with someone who calls themselves "_jiz_in_my_pants". Something tells me they might be a troll not worthy of your time.

If it doesn't affect the end user in a noticeable way, then yes.--it's handled. That's all that "handling" a situation means to anyone: "How much am I gonna get in trouble for this?"

If the domain has "fork" or "log" in the name--then I don't trust it as a reliable source of news.

We don't have the power to allow them or not allow them to do anything; BTC is decentralized--coinbase isn't. Our only option is that if we don't like the way they do things, then don't use them.
But as for now, Coinbase is necessary, and the public disposition towards BTC is dubious. So at the end of the day it's best to just suck it up and comply, or go elsewhere with our wallets and BTC purchases/sales.
I, for one would much rather buy/sell my BTC through coinbase than local bitcoins, though.


I think I would have preferred "invasive". Invading makes it sound like an army is coming in and pillaging the village and raping the women--and no one has a choice to do anything about it. In this case, it's much less dangerous.
@_date: 2015-02-25 07:36:36
If you want BTC to go mainstream, just deal with the growing pains. When it can walk on its own, and start-ups are generally competent enough to gain the trust of the end-user, then we'll have the true bitcoin. 
"Privacy-invading questions" you make it sound like the gas chambers.

I suppose the 2018 world proposed by OP is one in which a large portion of the economy is done in bitcoin. Which means some people live only in bitcoin--receive salary, pay for goods/services in bitcoin. It would have it's own value, no longer being tied to the dollar.
In OPs fictitious (for now) world, saying that the tenant's rent price went up by 7% would be like saying the same today because the Euro had gained a 7% increase.
OP also neglects that, if BTC is valued at $18k by 2018, it most likely won't be fluctuating at ~5% on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:21:02
but no one is defining that situation as being "handled."
@_date: 2015-02-25 07:11:13
I think that's one of the downsides of a decentralized world: a heavily inflated assessment of your abilities. Like blogging, in a sense: just because you can publish your writing for the world to see, doesn't make you a journalist.
