We certainly see those who are cooperating with regulators, and those who appear not to find themselves in gov't crosshairs. Ultimately regulation is coming, with the process accelerated by Mt Gox collapse and hacking of other services. If the scope of a business' service falls under currently defined and regulated categories, it will be regulated. 
It's too bad Bitcoin Foundation wasn't more pro-active in developing best practices for the exchanges like the founding president promised.

If exchanges have significant overhead due to regulation, this could diminish demand for bitcoin. Value is perceived, and increasing demand tends to raise value since there is more fiat chasing a limited supply of bitcoin. So decreasing demand will depress value. This could impact mining and blockchain maintenance, such that this becomes cost prohibitive for most new entrants. Thus mining will become more concentrated, with the increasing possibilty of majority control. Regulation that imposes any significant costs could totally undermine the system.

Mark Karpeles admitted on March 21 they found 200,000 "forgotten" bitcoins on March 7, a week after Mt.Gox filed for bankruptcy protection. Online sleuths had noticed around 200,000 bitcoins moving through the crypto-currency exchange after the bankruptcy filing.
On March 20, a Chicago U.S. judge overseeing a class action against Mt. Gox allowed tracking of the exchange's bitcoin. Class action attorney Steven Woodrow said "today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we've been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it 'found' these bitcoins."
"It appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins."

He cites several experts who spoke at a recent eSentire hosted panel discussion in San Francisco. According to former Central Intelligence Agency CTO Gus Hunt, in the future, the dollar could well become a crypto currency. "Government's going to learn from Bitcoin, and all the official government currencies are going to become crypto currencies themselves." 
Fellow panelist G. Mark Hardy, president of National Security Corporation, believes eventually, Bitcoin itself may be supplanted. "I believe that Bitcoin is going to go the way of Napster."

I disagree. You may not think Target is all that progressive, it's certainly had it's missteps. But retailers are becoming very social media conscious, so there are a number of fronts where we can leverage our dissatisfaction with Walmart, and "voting" for a competitor is one way. 
Target is the  retailer, and they started allowed bitcoin gift card purchases back in November, nearly 6 months before Walmart's brief toe-dipping. All I'm saying is that as Walmart's closest competitor who does support bitcoin, shopping at Target instead of Walmart can send a message.

With the rapid expansion of bitcoin investments, there have increasingly been discussions of adding functionality and expanding scalability of the block chain. One reason many bitcoin businesses, including exchanges, don't currently run on the block chain is the limited number of transactions it's capable of supporting, around 9 per second. 
Several of the Bitcoin Core Developers weigh in on a proposal to create auditable side chains that would be able to communicate with the main block chain in what is called 'two-way pegging.' There could be multiple side chains to support different currencies, derivatives, option shares, future contracts, and programmable trust instruments, for example. 
Not everyone is on board, but it appears there may be sufficient developer support for the concept to mature.
