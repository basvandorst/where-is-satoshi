Ah yes, and how many in this "criminal cabal" have been charged with crimes or plead guilty? Come back to reality.

Here's what I mean by context:
This is just a taste of the evidence supporting an obvious love triangle between WikiLeaks, Putin's regime, and Trump + associates.

The Clinton Foundation was not shut down. You fell for actual fake news.

The CGI downsized after the 2016 election, which Bill announced would happen in August of that year. It had nothing to do with criminal wrongdoing though.

I mean yeah, you could interpret it that way if you willfully ignored all context. The words and actions of Assange and WikiLeaks make their intentions crystal clear.

Same here, which is one of the many reasons I’ll be getting the hell out of the Midwest soon. I spent a couple months in San Francisco last year and was getting deliveries to my door within 20 minutes. Gawd damn I miss that place ��

I mean, the US does have the largest legal weed market in the world. What’s cool about the Netherlands is you can actually smoke in the coffee shop instead of having to take it home like the US. Although I don’t think the sale or consumption is technically legal there, in general police turn a blind eye and only respond when they’re called.

Some coffee shops in the Netherlands sell weed.
