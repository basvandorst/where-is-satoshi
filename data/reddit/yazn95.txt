That's what I'm thinking, are we about to see the greatest correction of all time? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:41:50
Would it be logical to assume that a dip is inevitable when the price rises $800-$900 in the span of 12 to 14 hours?

I don't see many people say this but I wondered if setting a stop limit would help? That way if it crashes you'll be able to obtain something rather than nothing.

Lol now that I can agree with.

Its swinging between 15k and 15.4k

My question is, why would you pay in btc if the value is constantly rising? I understand you don't want to pay in cash or checks but are you more willing to lose out on the extra possible money?

Based off what I've seen in the last several months I assume there'll be a correction tomorrow but idk I could be wrong, I've noticed it drops a bit usually the day after a crazy surge like this.

Coinbase updates the price more often than CNBC

you'd make like 5 bucks for every thousand dollars it goes up

Putting them in GDAX gets rid of the fees you pay every time you want to buy or sell on coinbase. You also dont have to wait 9 days every time you want to buy or sell on GDAX, it just happens instantly.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:28:33
I dont have an accurate answer to your question but I heard someone say it is probably more safer to leave them in GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:40:37
Actually we're going back up. Never try to test the market because believe me you wont win...always hodl.

I feel that way too, I thought there'd be a major dip after that crazy surge but no we just keep going higher. I guess the safe thing to do is to set a stop limit in case it does really crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:54:16
But that was during a recovery from the previous dip, I meant when it was rising to all time highs.

I think its best to hold but ultimately its your decision and how much money you are ok with to lose. I got in 5 months ago and have been through 2-3 major dips including this one, and refuse to sell. From my experience and what I've seen thus far, it will fall but it will also rise back up twice the amount it fell. If you wanna play it safe set a sell limit on GDAX and therefore if it falls below a certain threshold you would have kept something rather than lose it all. Again, it is your decision to make and all we can say is hodl.
