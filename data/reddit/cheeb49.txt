To be a billionaire at 3.5m each you would need you would need 286BTC, my friends and family don't have that many...

Yeah companies are still registering, as it gets closer there'll be more info. I'd recommend signing up just in case.

Yeah, They were originally going to try to premiere at Sundance (early January), but they kept pushing back the release so they could include everything that was happening in Nov-Dec until today, one of the producers even went to Dorian's house to get some footage. I'm excited to see it.

Their intentions are to get the movie seen by the most people possible, and to help explain/expose bitcoin to a more mainstream audience. 
Last I heard is that were trying to to sell it to a premium cable channel like HBO or Showtime. It most likely won't go to any theaters. But I'm sure once it premieres on TV there'll be a torrent out there for those without cable. 
EDIT: I know one of the producers, last time i talked to him was a few weeks ago, before the premiere at Tribeca.
