You need a selfie because of fraud associated with online Interac payments. I dont care I'll give them a selfie if i can deposit fiat in 60 minutes. If you don't like this policy go buy through Localbitcoins or an ATM where you pay 10-25% more. I don't really understand what hte big deal is. Even on Localbitcoins sellers who take Interac require a selfie

Hi, I'm a chinese- english translator. The news that btc will be banned is fake. From Okcoin's Weibo.
In order to prevent panic (and large volume of trading) like the last time false news came out on 21 March, we have already set up enough resources to deal with situations like this when they arise. There is no related press release on the website of People’s Bank of China. We condemn the use of false news news used to cause panic. OKcoin will pay close attention to news about regulation
Thats the most important bit off OkCoins weibo account
Basically its FUD

Download Myriadcoin QT. Yes its a pain in the ass to download XYZcoin QT, espeically if you have 5+ altcoins but do it. This is precisely why. I did it with the altcoins and withdrew all of them, but I left 0.15 btc in there from a dogecoin sell order that got filled a few weeks ago. Taht money is gone now :(

Here's a translation of the most important parts. I'm Chinese. A lot of it is just about BTCChina and how they are the best, safe, new products...etc.
Points 1 and 2 are really only important thing, and they're not really important
BTCChina hasn't received any notice about restriction for deposits or withdrawals from the Central Bank of China. 
Some other crap about the core benefits of bitcoin not being affected even if there was a ban, although the price would be volatile.
1. Bitcoin China will do a third-party audit and it will be the first bitcoin company who accepts this kind of audit. We will declare the results later. 
2. Bitcoin China is updating the trading platform now
3.Bitcoin China's new innovative products are in the beta stage. Details will be announced later.
4. We will communicate with the regulatory authorities actively to get the latest regulatory information and set industry standards...
blah blah blah some other crap about customer feedback being important

Google "litecoin qt". Download it, encrypt your wallet with a password (a very strong password and DONT FORGET IT, you cant recover your LTC if you forget your password).
It'll take you about a day to sync Litecoin qt, but its definitely better than leaving your money on any exchange. Also make a few copies of the file "wallet.dat" and put it on a couple of USB sticks, floppy disks (hahaha)...etc
As for btc-e I've used them before, and still do for some altcoins. Don't keep your money on any exchange. If you are daytrading, day trade then move your coins out.

I might be late but how will swaps and P2P lending work on OKCoin. I recall reading somewhere that it will be insured, so less risk. Don't you expect millions of Chinese to pour money into that and really lower the interest rate?
Also I plan on depositing 50% of surplus savings to earn interest, what are the tax implications in China since I'm a foreigner? Also would one have to file taxes on capital gains in China if using OKCoin and being based in China?
Should shit hit the fan, aka a Gox happens, I'm pretty sure I'll have little legal recourse in getting any money back, correct?
And finally, I also plan on using OKCoin to send some money back to my home country bank account. Do you foresee any problems on my end with Chinese banks? It'll probably be around 500-1000 USD a month and I'll be working legally with a Z visa.
Also are you hiring for any positions, including customer support? I have a Chinese friend looking to switch jobs.
Thanks, OKCoin rox!

A late comment but I saw this too. Winnipeg is probably right in that the owner might be targeting sketchy people with that huge 20-30% markup and no KYC
As an aside since I'm not in Ottawa anymore, why don't you become a seller on Localbitcoins. Theres almost no one selling for cash, and your competition is an atm with a 25% markup. You can easily sell for a 10% markup and make a couple hundred extra per month. When I was selling I had people tell me they bought off localbitcoins (me) instead of the atm cause of the crap markup

I have one question specifically for OKCoin.cn. In Canada and US traders are required to declare and pay  taxes on any gains made through trading bitcoins. What is the case in China and for Chinese traders?
