Guys, help us spread this attitude and this case on the web! Post in your blog, website, Facebook, Bitcoin community or anything else. Let's rise this campaign! Let's show to the world what Bitcoin community is by fact. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:09:08
You understood the sentence. "BTCJam cracked!", better now? 
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:23:23
But I saw a lot of articles on Google (and some posts in Reddit too) about this "comparations". How they do that? We cannot provide a near estimative?
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:53:21
Yes, I already saw that. I posted a Note about that on Github. I will post here, hope you understand :)
"Oh my...fuck!
Today I discover that "Bitcoin History" exists and use the same concept I choose to this project. They have a nice website with a great timeline, they're great - but fuck this shit, we're open-source bitch! \o/"
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:18:00
This project is open source too, feel free to suggest things, fork and do whatever you want: 
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:40:07
Later I'll update this topic, now I need study "Computer Organization and Design", test tomorrow - sorry guys. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:21:08
Awesome attitude! I'll help! :)
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:52:38
Maybe it was cracked, please read that:

Gustavo Guida, sorry about the inconvenience, but I maybe have a bad news for you. I will write in Portuguese, sorry english speakers.
Gustavo, pode acompanhar esse tópico aqui? 
Tem um cara que está sabendo de mais problemas de segurança no BTCJam, olha o comentário dele logo abaixo. Ele é o João Canhada, um membro muito respeitado na comunidade brasileira de Bitcoin no Facebook. 
"Avisa ele, que esse é o menor dos males, esse scritpt ja avia sido dito que não fez nada, acontece que por causa desta informação, tentaram invadir de outras formas, e pelo que fui informado obtiveram sucesso.."
**For the english speakers:**
A user from brazilian Bitcoin community (on the Facebook) heard about some dangerous security issues in BTCJam. Also, far he knows, this security issues was explored successfully by a cracker.
I'm not sure about that, just telling what a member from Brazilian community told me.
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:04:42
As a future computer scientist, I should say that this topic was a mistake and also I want to publicly apologize, .
The moment I created this post I was moved by passion, not by scientific reason. By the way, I'm not libertarian, I just believe that Bitcoin can solve a lot of people needs. We need more guys like you, (but try to be less passionate in your public critics about Bitcoin, hope you can be more scientific in our next conversations too).
Let's continue talking on Twitter, I would like to discuss amicably and scientifically with you.
@_date: 2015-05-22 12:16:22
He wrote bullshits here too?
@_date: 2015-05-22 12:11:57
What do you want mean?
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:39:16
Guys, just to keep you informed: Gustavo Guida was talking with the members of brazilian community that discovered the security issues. I'm not inside the conversation, but these members (that discovered the issues) told brazilian community that BTCJam have another bigger security issues, not just this one fixed by Gustavo Guida and BTCJam developers. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:28:56
This really happened?

Someone grab the popcorn, please.
@_date: 2015-04-04 13:51:44
Of course, because a very popular and respected channel in Brazil talk about Bitcoin for a half million people is bad. You don't understand, corruption and politicians are the most criticized things here in Brazil, anyone that talks against the government and politicians is **VERY** respected.
If you wanted to say that Bitcoin being a widespread currency is bad, so I agree with you. And in this case you're a brain sick.
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:12:46
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-04-04 14:46:22
That's exactly what I would like to mean. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:13:30

He made a small Bitcoin reference in his last video:
This video isn't available with English subtitles yet.
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:16:50
Someone knows the answer?
@_date: 2015-04-04 13:31:40
Comments are welcome! if this post became famous I will contact "Canal do Otário" and show him this post, then we can convince him to talk about Bitocin in his channel. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 13:31:25
Why downvoted? :'( 
@_date: 2015-03-22 16:06:08
That's probably happened, Allex really like Bitcoin conferences and travelled all over the world.
@_date: 2015-03-22 16:04:03
For who don't know Allex, he's an (almost) active member of brazilian community that you probably saw if you go to some big event of Bitcoin in Latin America (like LaBitconf Argentina, Rio and some brazilian bitconfs). 
Some guys asked for his Twitter or Facebook account to give some tips, but I just have find his Flickr (yes, he is a photographer): 
@_date: 2015-03-04 23:40:01
Don't forget, if you can focus on articles talking about the association betweem Bitcoin and the crimes and illicit things. :)
@_date: 2015-03-22 13:54:18
Also, Allex paid everything with Bitcoin using Anxpro card:
@_date: 2015-03-22 16:05:02
Only find his Flickr: 
@_date: 2015-03-22 13:52:04
