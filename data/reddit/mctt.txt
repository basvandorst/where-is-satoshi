It would be nice if they didn't. 
It's for this very reason I suggest they have the support of this type of fund.
It's near impossible to run a story on say Tylenol if an advertiser can pull funding because of objective publicity.
NPR is a non-profit. The EFF is a non-profit and it turns out the EFF have corporate sponsors too  (see the bottom of the page, humble bundle).
I would not like to see either organisation restricted by the will of corporate sponsors.

Thanks, I had not seen the previous post about this. 
This was one of the reasons I did not put more into bitcoin. I could not be sure that my understanding of the security could keep up.

Thanks. I was thinking of exchanges really and trying find the claim made elsewhere.
Seems like a *copypasta* from [ Reuters ](  ) then [The Telegraph](  ) copies it verbatim.
What's this coming next bit?

That's just it; Cold storage, two factor auth. It takes some discipline and time to do it right.
It was that and the fact that from the UK it's been very tricky to turn GBP into BTC.

Thanks, so to answer my own question using the bitsquare.io description;


So while it's true that you can trade with family, friends and using services like localcoin, it's a possibility that in the future with the rise of decentralised systems like Open Bazaar and BitSquare that Bitcoin can bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central control.

Adguard reports malware. Could be a false positive but a risky click.

The article states;


I'm not sure how true this is. Does anyone have any answer?

PayPal would not let me buy what I wanted. Bitcoin would.
I tried to buy about £30 GBP of bitcoin but the bank transaction limit was reached.
It took a few days of trying but I eventually managed to buy 3 bitcoins.
I figured that I don't want to be waiting several days to purchase bitcoin so I was thinking to either buy 300 or 3000.
As I was about to buy a house I figured I might need three grand so clicked to buy 300 bitcoin, transaction limit reached.
So I posted a question asking how to buy bitcoin in the UK. The answer I got was localcoin. To me the security and beauty of bitcoin was not embodied in the localcoin concept. Specifically, I didn't think giving a stranger money and hoping they provide bitcoin was a smart idea and would inevitably lead to getting my fingers burned. Bitcoin was about £90 GBP at the time.
Since then when bitcoin was at it's peak I sent £69 (0.27 satoshi) to two friends. I just wanted to see what they made of it.
I did send passport and banking verification to Mt.Gox but I was busy with a job, family and moving house. So I never got around to thinking any further about sending 300 to 3000 pounds to a Ltd company in Japan.
I bought an Amazon voucher as well. £100 and it took about half an hour to register the transaction.

When he says in the interview "Inflation is built in to pay for miners" what does he mean?
I notice in Armory that there is a 0.0005 Default fee included to contribute to computing power, but, is there something else going on?
[edit] Answered my own question. Thought I would share just for interest.
