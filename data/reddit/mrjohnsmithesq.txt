Jealousy doesn't motivate every one of them, but here's a case in point. He missed the chance to buy in at $70, as he was waiting for the "REAL" price of $25. Now wastes his time shitting on bitcoin everyday. No words, it's pathetic

He's already made enough money for the rest of his life, by having thousands of Bitcoins hasn't he? 
He could want to get even richer, but he's not a wage slave.

You know how it would work out. He won't dare buy in if it fell to $75 again. He's obviously got no balls, he'll say he's buying in at $15. 
No trading plan, just cowardice and following the herd, always one day behind.
He'll never lose because he never plays.

You two seem to irritate each other sometimes. That's a pity, both your contributions are very valuable
But you know? The common public perception is already that you are a lot, a lot more trollish than he? Always seeking attention, while he looks so calm.
Perception is nine tenths of the law, or something like that
Usually it's like this for outside vs insider. An outsider has to troll to get attention, but by the end, the outsider usually stays outside. First mover advantage
Well perhaps the most significant input into your relative reputations is the price, not your arguments. If we see $99 bitcoin and then everyone would be your fan!
