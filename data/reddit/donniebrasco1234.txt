Yes because selling makes you a noob or a weak hand right? Do you actually hear yourself right now?

Watch out guys, we got the bitcoin expert here who doesn't understand what volatility means. The fact that bitcoin over the past few months has underwent changes in 100%'s of percentage then it definitely warrants worrying and precaution. This isn't the stock market, bitcoin isn't guaranteed to go up again in the long run back to the bubble price it was at a couple months ago.

Because in general for the past almost 100 years the market has grown by around 5-8% yearly. If you were looking at one stock like how you say you should look at bitcoin, which is fair, then if you saw it suddenly have nearly a 1000% increase in the span of a couple months you would realize that it is a bubble. I mean in stocks, anytime this happens, which is rare, it is usually some cheapo penny stock that is being manipulated in price and then exit scammed, the same thing happened with bitcoin, a couple big players with a huge percentage of the market were just mass trading the cryptocurrency making the price skyrocket. This happens in some of the smaller cryptocoins all the time and then once those people shoot the price high enough they just pump and dump.

You know something is a good buy when everyone already invested in it has to constantly preach about buying it right?
