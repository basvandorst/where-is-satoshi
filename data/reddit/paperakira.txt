The hole in the wall is called Cuallix. They had it posted everywhere at the time as proof "the banks were starting to use xrp". You can still find old articles bragging about cuallix. Look up Financiera Cuallix on google earth. All the other stuff can be seen in the previous site I linked or were from personal experience when I worked at a large contracting firm.

XRP was used as a funding vehicle for ripple labs to get their SWIFT competitor off the starting line. The people involved are scummy and this is plain as day what occurred. They hand out huge amounts of XRP to corporations just so they can say "we are working with this huge corp" (I know, I worked for one of these companies that has zero plans to use XRP but was gifted a huge amount). They also contantly lied early on about "banks" that were already using XRP and when you googled the banks you would see they were literal hole in the walls in a ghetto in mexico.

it also empowers corporations to work in their best interest rather than people's which leads to situations like charging couples to be allowed to hold their babies after childbirth, charging people 600 dollars for epipens and lobbing for changing laws to allow corporations to have more power  in deciding the laws of the land than individuals. Which leads to a host of other issues that lead to mass death, sickness, addiction, and income inequality.
