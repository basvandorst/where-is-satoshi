I'm pretty sure this bot did that. I only wrote some random string that happens to be my address. Nobody likes you crypto_bot!

Nah, that was artificial too. The organic price was $3 so we're going there.

If you want to claim B2X and separate it after the fork, you would need to import your wallet in to a software or website that supports importing addresses (Electrum, Blockchain.info, MyCelium etc). Then just follow their steps. First you'll claim new coins and then you'll probably transfer them to a new address. But I suggest waiting at least few weeks after the fork before doing anything. If you want to sell coins right after the fork, then send BTC to the exchange before the fork. Most of the exchanges will take care of that.

That's true. But if I'm homeless and housed I wouldn't freeze to death in winter. Being homed and houseless doesn't fix that problem.

I've read a few articles, and I believe the steps are importing to a blockchain.info wallet the entire amount since the Private Key will be exposed in doing a withdrawal, run any transactions, then to push back to paper, repeat the steps above to generate a new paper wallet and transfer out of the blockchain.info wallet.
It doesn't need to be blockchain.info to import your paper wallet address. You can use Electrum, Mycellium or other software that supports importing addresses.


Yes since your address is derived from public key which is connected to your private key. You would both have access to your wallets.


Yes. All addresses and transactions on blockchain are public. 


Maybe you were looking at the private key QR code on your paper? 


If you give your private and public key to other person than yes. That person can use your old address if he's stupid enough. But chances are ~0 that the same address would be random generated twice.

We are talking about year 2140. AI doesn't need money. Who knows how bitcoin will look like by then.
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:49:06
We are still in early phase. Bitcoin is evolving. What's now a problem, won't be a problem in the future. Transaction fees will become very low and confirmation time will also become matter of past with future bitcoin upgrades. One step at the time. Be patient.

To derive the public key from private key [Ecliptic Curve Cryptography is used]( 
The function EC_POINT_mul() in Python.
Starting with a private key in the form of a randomly generated number k, you multiply it by a predetermined point on the curve called the generator point G to produce another point somewhere else on the curve, which is the corresponding public key K.
The generator point is specified as part of the [secp256k1]( standard and is always the same for all keys in bitcoin: K = k * G
where k is the private key, G is the generator point, and K is the resulting public key, a point on the curve.
Because the generator point is always the same for all bitcoin
users, a private key k multiplied with G will always result in the same public key K.
The relationship between k and K is fixed, but can only be calculated in one direction,
from k to K. That’s why a bitcoin address (derived from K) can be shared with anyone
and does not reveal the user’s private key (k).
And to derive address from public key, [hashing]( process is used.
Read a book [Mastering bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos]( It goes in depth explaining everything about blockchain technology.
[Here's the script of creating bitcoin address from a predefined private key] ( from his book.

He clearly has other things to do than study cryptocurrencies. He obviously doesn't understand it well and gave layman's opinion.

This. Not to mention that not a single TA applies for cryptocurrencies since they are too volatile and haven't got previous stable patterns which take years to acquire in non volatile markets.
