Should we still be optimistic for next week's conference? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:13:55
The support above 9k has been unbelievable for Bitcoin as of late. Now we just gotta HODL!
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:44:52
I'm afraid that too many people are expecting to go up because of this event, only to have us dip further into oblivion �� but I'm still hopeful! I'm HODLing long time so it's irrelevant to me ��
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:12:33
Bitcoin is choke city today
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:14:40
Does anyone here think next weeks conference will bring Bitcoin above 10k again? Really craving to see my holdings skyrocket in value ��
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:46:49
This is painful.
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:04:20
Let's see this thing cross 9k again! Fingers crossed ��
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:12:32
Honestly, all these random numbers for what Bitcoin will eventually be valued at is just starting to get under my skin. Predictions are perfectly normal, but enough of this constant 24/7 speculation. Let the industry evolve and thrive before seeing where it takes us! 
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:07:53
Wow, for the first time in a while I am actually shocked by a dip. Was not expecting this one at all ��
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:54:18
Have a friend who wants to buy in today, you guys think it's a good idea? ��
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:29:38
Happy to see that push this morning. Was honestly feeling pretty down a couple days ago but my belief in Bitcoin will never die! 
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:13:02
Time to buy in on the discount and HODL for my life. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:43:23
 I suspect we might drop below 7k in the coming days. If that's the case, I have no doubt that it's time to increase my position while it's cheap ��
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:40:23
Just got an extra 100$ to spend on crypto! Anyone think I should right now?
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:16:09
I've noticed the growth as well. Proud to be part of this! 
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:12:04
What a drop! 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:53:13
Now own .01 of a bitcoin. Hope it's worth something one way ��
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:02:08
Considering how bad bitcoin is today this is certainly reassuring :))))
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:23:42
This is glorious. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:59:45
Is it time for the bull run? ��
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:39:57
Gotta HODL at all costs! 
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:26:43
Thinking about buying in the next couple hours. Thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:24:12
Mostly libertarians who are all about economic freedom and as little government involvement as possible! 
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:31:54
There you go again 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:17:04
Will the G20 conference really make a difference? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:29:35
How low do you guys really think this could get? Wanna know the right time to buy..
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:31:32
Nice to see a spike, hopefully we will be rolling to 9-10k in no time! 
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:15:41
What a fucking shitty way to wake up ��
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:20:21
I hope you are right buddy! 
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:02:01
Anyone think it dips under 7k today? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:31:45
I am with you there! 
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:52:38
It is officially time to buy and HODL to victory?
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:17:47
Sub 7400 now, anyone think this dips under 7k?
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:19:22
We are HODLing for our lives I think 
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:28:46
Where's the bull run guys? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:56:05
HODLing to those gains after buying in at the 6k low has never felt sweeter ��
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:43:04
What will the month of May bring us? Curious to hear some legitimate predictions! 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:44:28
Wow did I go long at the wrong time ��
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:40:28
You have to love waking up to all that green in the morning! 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:20:18
Oh does it feel good to get out of that 6k hell hole! 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:35:23
What the hell happened? ��
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:50:06
Are we finally in the clear? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:32:30
Anyone else sick of seeing bitcoin between 6500-7000?
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:10:20
Bear market seems to be dead. Gotta love it!
