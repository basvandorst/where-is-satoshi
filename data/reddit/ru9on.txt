After all impatient people sold, it will skyrocket again.

This was it. Correction has completed. Expect sharp gains over the weekend. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:38:27
Yes, you are. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:11:13
It’s going to 20k today. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:17:43
True if true.

China Hustle is about financial fraud. Has nothing to do with trade deficit. Funny how you think to know what you are talking about after watching and misinterpreting one documentary.

I’m going to hold but I’m not buying this dip. Going to wait a few weeks and see how this all plays out. I mean it just feels wrong to me to add risk at this point. But ofcourse I hope you made the right move.

Anyone here ever traded these XBT products from USA?
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:29:18
Well you did misinterpret my first comment by remarking I denied the existence of a trade deficit. Seems you don’t read that well either. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:35:36
Cuz they know we HODLing.

You mean support. Resistance was met at 19.600.

I think around 16000 will be the low befote we shoot past 20000. This dip had been so systematicaly orchestrated. Typical accumulative shuffle. Hope you didn’t sell.

The way this article equates trade deficit with China stealing from USA bothers me. It’s a false Trumpian narrative, based on poor understanding of economics. Devalues the whole article. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:22:39
Not. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:10:15
Engaged a under 16000 : )

Bitcoin is not a bubble. The price could be in bubble territory, but it is not.

No need to think in centers. Asswipe.

Enjoy the weather, see us on monday.

Except for Bobby Axelrod, nobody knows where market prices are heading.

XBT has had BTC and ETH ETF’s for years. What’s the big deal?
@_date: 2019-10-22 07:09:37

Shouldn't the fortune in every fortune cookie be "You are about to eat a stale cookie?”

Sold 20% of my stack on Wednesday, bought back in on Friday. Now I own a little more than before, so that’s nice.
