Honestly even the lawmakers in this meeting also had a somewhat positive look towards Digital Currencies, and a very stern but very necessary look at ICOs. 
If they want to raise money from the public they should be regulated. Period. A lot of “decentralization” champions in this market (all of us included) cry and complain to the thought regulation, but not a single one of us would like to be scammed or be taken for fools. Deal with it.
Welcome regulation where it’s needed.
I think this meeting puts a slow down to the bleeding market also... and of course, not a single article this morning from the MSM on how well this meeting went lol. Smh.
