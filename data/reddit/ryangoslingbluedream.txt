Lightning network is not ready and won’t be. Plus it’s a centralized way to introduce middle men again. Why would anyone want that. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:26:11
You are in denial.... 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:57:37
It’s never coming or not any time soon. Why? Because lighting was promised 2 Years ago and said was coming soon..... I would not even get my hopes up. Big blocks seem to be working but I guess we are all just waking up. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:08:06
To transfer you will need 18 and it will take 12 hours 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:03:00
You have to understand that bitcoin was never like this. It was fast and cheap to send. Ever since the network of users grew the need for bigger blocks was necessary. However for some reason the developers decided that they would rather have insane fees and cripple the merchant support already established. Now it’s a useless hold for people who have too much at stake and won’t admit they were wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:10:25
Fucking dumbasses want to hold useless digital gold. Wake the fuck up. We want digital cash and bitcoin to be accepted everywhere. Can’t you guys fucking see what you have become. Disgusting and greedy holders. You do nothing to further the vision of a truly decentralized world.. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:16:20
Holy shit is he fucking stupid? Does he not see that bitcoin cash is working atm.... how blind does one have to be. How delusional??? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:28:49
It won’t be a store of value soon. Lol... it’s fucking over for the core developers. They ruined this project. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:20:36
Bitcoin lives on in two chains. If one decides that they don’t want to be digital currency or accepted as payment then let them. The best thing we can do is educate our fellow bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:57:50
Yes this is what you guys have become... enjoy it. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:08:04
Super fud 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:27:49
No they are going to use lightning channels as a middle man. Fucking idiots lol. Wake up. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:58:56
I don’t even use coinmarketcap but okay good job. It’s a relic so many better price tracking websites that update in real time. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:44:09
Do it you bunch of whiny babies. Hahaha 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:51:08
Wrong sub these guys don’t use bitcoin they just hold.. lol 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:00:21
Why are we just realizing this. Did it really take Microsoft and Steam to drop merchant support to find out bitcoin sucks now? How is this possible? Oh right we decided a larger block was too centralized.... give me a break. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:41:28
Lolol that’s bitcoin. My bch transactions get confirmed in 20 mins with less than 1 cent in fees. Sorry not sorry. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:58:29
Boo coinbase 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:15:11
Really are you just hodl. Is that it? Hodl. Make some memes and hodl. This is important news....
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:27:52
Exactly my fucking point. Thanks hodl. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:44:07
It’s useless for any transaction... period 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:24:26
I’d say bitcoin cash will handle it a lot better than bitcoin. Why? Because the community there have a plan. A 2mb will be enough to handle the transactions of bitcoin. 8mb will be implemented in say a few years. Who’s the say this isn’t a solution.... memory is cheap and will get even cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:26:59
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:40:26
Did you really need to confirm...............,,,,,,, just look at the companies website 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:58:36
You guys are going to dip below it. Watch 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:09:41
When bitcoin become like this. A bunch of sheep headed for the slaughter 
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:42:47
They are basically the fiat on ramp... who else are they going to use. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:28:05
That is a downward trend? What do you mean it’s  not. Looks like it. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:05:56
Bro don’t do it man. Just don’t do it. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:43:24
Use the clone coin... zzzzzz 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:18:46
Lol �� this is gold. You really deserve a pat on the back. You must be new. Welcome to crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:11:45
Lightning is a fucking joke... they’ll lie and say it’s ready when it’s not even working correctly.... why do off chain scaling when you can upgrade on chain... Jesus fuck. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:42:34
People are switching ever since they took off Korean pricing. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:07:19
It’s dead but reborn a clone ready to take its place very soon. The core developers have crippled what this community worked hard to achieve. They should be held responsible. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:17:36
So you are saying let the bch folks win. I’m okay with that but still I’ll feel sorry for you kids still on the burning train. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:12:08
No shit... it’ll actually work but bitcoin core devs control bitcoin. Meanwhile everyone’s making stupid ass comments about Jihan for making money on bitcoin wtf is this shit. I’d rather be more mad at the devs for causing Microsoft and Steam to drop btc support. Fuck them! And fuck this useless community for just sitting and watching. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:16:43
I’m just a troll 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:12:11
Lmao �� you actually look at this shit 
@_date: 2017-02-15 19:55:33
RemindMe! 3 years "Can you buy a lambo with 1 BTC?"
@_date: 2017-03-31 03:38:36
Are you serious it is fine stop being a baby. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:21:56
Already sold at 1280s lol buy my coins 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:31:19
Sell you fool 
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:39:10
Well shit that was fast haha, I'll buy back when etf gets approved oh wait 
@_date: 2018-10-18 00:41:57
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:55:10
25 dollars worth of bitcoin can't afford fee bs lol 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:18:32
I’d say fuck them and buy alts. Bitcoin is centralized by miners. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:27:19
Dam boy calling them out 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:44:44
Jesus 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:46:31
Haha r/investing more like r/speculators. Bitcoin&gt;stocks 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:45:02
Garbage 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:53:44
I’d say bitcoin will die out in a few years. So will bitcoin cash. Alts will take over after all the drama ends. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 01:14:21
I don't fuck with youuu
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:03:51
He just bought some apple stocks baby steps pleaseeee
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:39:20
It’s not that im worried about the talent. It’s the friction behind the community and how progress is made. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:06:19
There’s no way bitcoin network can handle mass adoption especially with all these forks. There is definitely going to be a chance for alts to improve on the underlying tech behind bitcoin and take over. It’s the most likely scenario. Downvote me but bitcoins marketcap over time will shrink in comparison to alt coin marketcap.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:06:33
They aren’t going to release a statement if they are not sure what to do yet.  Obvious. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:06:09
You bought the peak well fucking done 
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:10:24
Really you gave him bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:20:04
Can we stop this madness 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:44:38
Are you 12?
