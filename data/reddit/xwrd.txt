I now get it, it's much better to represent data your way.
@_date: 2018-08-08 08:00:03
Could you explain why you think that? I've looked at [wikipedia]( and to me the tax rates look about the same.

Can you rephrase that, so I can better understand your point? Euro doesn't have a velocity close to 1 so I assume you're talking hypothetically, but I'm not sure what the Euro and the Bolivar represent. Also, not sure what the point of debating extremes is, hyperinflation and hyperdeflation are both bad for the society. But if I were to pick between 2% yearly inflation and 2% yearly deflation, I'd pick inflation. It incentivizes active investment.

Interesting take on deflation. I'd like to challenge some of your points, hoping to better educate myself. 
When you said that it takes the pressure off from making bad investments, I was expecting an example of a bad investment that you can make during times of inflation, but you provided one that appears during deflation, and which looks bad only for some people ([examples of negative yield bond buyers and their reasons]( But I want to turn that idea around and say that the pressure to make investments, which can turn out to be bad, is also the pressure to make good investments. Which makes currency circulate, keeps people employed etc. and is what I've been saying.


I'd also challenge that, see [The Effect of Deflation on the Stock Market]( for reasons and historical records, and let me know if you disagree.


I do agree with you in principle, but deflation was very rare (mainly because until last century, shortages in labor and resources were frequent and there were little means to prevent or mitigate them), and as far as I know, in every instance of a country going through even moderate deflation, the economy shrunk for that duration, the inequality went up, the quality of life went down.

By definition, currency is something that is in circulation as a medium of exchange. Sure, you can hoard currency for saving, but that's not the intended design and it's not the only way you can save. Today, those who can save prefer to do it in term deposits, stocks, bonds, real estate etc. A deflationary currency will incentivize people to delay their spending. This can lead to an economic crisis leading to lower production, lower wages, decreased demand and still lower prices. Eventually workers will be laid off and they will have to deplete their savings in order to make ends meet.

I 100% agree with you that deflation is a symptom. But I'd also add that inflation is a symptom, too. They're a measure of the economic environment, the average change in the amount of currency that the goods are traded for.
My point is that when you make the measurement and you get deflation, your environment is in an undesirable state, for the reasons I stated above -- will incentivize people to delay their spending, with all the consequences that follow. High inflation is also a bad state to be in -- the higher, the fewer people will have the ability to save wealth, the fewer companies will be profitable. This doesn't automatically mean that the best option is to be at 0 inflation. Main reason is that some inflation is a better incentive for people to actively invest their wealth than zero inflation.

If the bond has a fixed yield, then you're right, it's better to hold your cash, if you have cash. At least, I couldn't think of a way to make type 1 work with fixed yield. But bonds can have variable yield.
Type 1: Let's say the government issued a bond with variable yield "inflation +1%". Alice bought that bond when inflation was above zero. But now inflation is at -2%, so her bond is at -1%. Alice wants a car but, between paying for it with cash or exchanging her bond for it, she'd rather use the bond. The car owner has a car that depreciates at -2% per year, and would sell it for cash but would also settle for a bond at -1%, since that's a smaller loss than keeping the car. They make the trade and the car owner thus becomes a negative yield bond buyer.
Type 2: Bob lives in the US. The Swiss franc is now 1 dollar. Bob thinks the franc will be worth at least 1.1 dollars next year. Bob wants to buy francs but nobody wants to sell francs because of deflation. Bob buys 100 dollars worth of Swiss franc bonds (the Swiss government accepts even foreign currency for its bonds), bonds that now have a yearly yield of -5%. A year passes , the bonds mature and Bob gets 95 francs from the Swiss government. His prediction is correct, the franc is now exchanged at 1.1 dollars. He exchanges his francs for 104.5 dollars. Bob's return on investment is is 4.5%.
I think your subsidy argument works even better as a case for having positive inflation, as opposed to zero or negative. Inflation also drives people to compete with the highest ROI businesses, more so than deflation, since in deflation it's less costly to remain idle. Your ROI needs to be greater than the inflation value to keep your company afloat.

Forget other months. What about currencies? The euro, the dollar, the pound, the yen?
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:24:49
That's not the worst case scenario. The worst case scenario is no Bitcoin 2.
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:05:27
You'd be correct if OP would use the dollars to buy something other than bitcoin next.
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:48:44
I agree. I wonder if those sites that others have mention deal with counterparty risk.
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:49:44
True. And if you're sure you're not using them for anything for 6 months, and someone comes along and offers you money to borrow them, you're going to make a profit from that, regardless of where the Bitcoin price will be.

I'm upvoting because of your sarcasm skills.

If you privatize hospitals, and you have a child that is born with a tumor for which you can't pay the treatment even with a loan, what will happen? Your child will die.
Even in a free market, you need a government to enforce anti-monopoly laws, and to ensure companies don't endanger public health in order to maximize profits. And someone needs to pay for that. How do you respond?
@_date: 2019-01-24 06:55:32
Please try to have a discussion without name calling. You say the child will be taken care of. How? Who will pay for it?
Second, you say that government enables monopolies. That's not accurate. That is a mark of a corrupt government. I'm not American but I can show you a history of the [US Government breaking up big companies]( If you want health insurance providers to stop being protected from competing across states, demand that, in large numbers, from your government. If they don't listen, vote them out of the office. I know it's not easy, with human nature favoring the development of corruption, but at least there's a path towards what you want.
Third, since this started from your anti-tax stance, I want to know your solution to the problem of regulating markets, which is now done by a government paid by taxpayers. I want to know who's going to pay for preventing terrorist attacks, for defending borders, for natural disaster relief.

Interesting concept. I wonder if you apply this to November '18, when the price was above 6k, wouldn't you get the same prediction, that the bottom of the market is close?
@_date: 2019-01-24 07:26:33


I agree.


I came up with those minute little questions to show you where I think your system breaks down. If you don't have an answer, you can't convince me that your system works.

Ferrari 250 GTOs are scarce in the same way as Bitcoin. Sure, Ferrari can produce more, but just like those miners you mention(or, more specifically, the people that decide on the protocol), they wouldn't do that.
What I find more important is, what do you use Bitcoin for?
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:08:29
Could you elaborate on that? Are you talking about USA or the world? Urban or rural? I'd be pleasantly surprised for it to be so.
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:16:21
While that's certainly true, in US the baby boomers could afford a car, a house, and to max out a retirement fund much easier than a millenial. The cost of health services has increased. The cost of tuition has increased. Wages did not keep up with inflation. I actually think this is related to the reduction in global poverty, e.g. a chinese factory worker now works for more money, which means the american consumer has to pay more for the products that cost less in the past. But I also think the biggest factor is wealth accumulating at the top. My point is that for the low skilled worker, the purchasing power has decreased and continues to fall.
@_date: 2018-12-16 09:18:13
I find it funny that once I present arguments against being cheaper to live in the US for low skill workers, you change the subject to something else. I also find it funny that your path to living well involves extracting wealth from 2 roommates.
