@_date: 2018-01-01 08:07:19


The law applies from tax year 2018 going forward.  By making the amendment, they make clear that like-kind was available in years 2017 and prior.  I don't see how you can hold any other interpretation here; you don't change the law to exclude things that are already excluded.
Now, u/azzazaz is making quite a different point, and providing a very good argument.  I would like to see the IRS issue explicit guidance here and until they do, I find this a reasonable position to be taking, albeit one with some risk.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:03:38
How can you trust any of this information though?
If there truly was veracity to any of this they would have, should have, pressed the charges in court.

Especially vulnerable are systems running on Xen like AWS.  You can start up an instance for the express purpose of leeching data from the other instances running on that box.
I'm guessing that almost every exchange out there has at least some processes running on the cloud like this.

Then they didn't need to float this extraneous charge out there either.  No need whatsoever, if as you say they had the charges to put him away for life then why put the case at risk by making unsubstantiated charges, a case incidentally that was already at risk when it was revealed agents were stealing his property?
Ross was cutting into the profits big banks were making from laundering drug money.  That's his real crime.  That's why they threw the book at him.  And they were happy to engage in any lie, any travesty necessary to make it clear to any and all who would work to deprive them of their cut in the future that anything goes when they catch you.
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:16:48

Actually I think his argument is basically that if they want to tax crypto they should come right out and say so and address all of these issues.
The very fact that we are here debating this shit is appalling; there should be bonafide guidance on this and every other question related to altcoins and to date we've received nothing.
His analogy about exchanging a ten dollar bill for ten ones is a very good one btw.  Why isn't this the way we should be treating crypto?
And correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe he's advocated anywhere for not paying taxes when cashing out into fiat.  Here there is guidance.
No taxation without representation?  What kind of representation can we be enjoying if those who do the taxing don't even bother to tell us exactly what is taxed and when?  Oh, but watch out for the tax man cause he'll put you in jail?  It's outrageous!
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:48:28
No, that's a lie.  If it weren't a lie, they would have proven it in court.  They didn't because they couldn't.
Ross is no more guilty of murder than you are of any bullshit charge I might choose to make up.
Welcome to America where dirty tricks like this are the norm and not the exception.  The reason they chose to tell this lie is to destroy any sympathy Ross might have otherwise received.

Except that the IRS ruled that crypto is property and not a security.
And you're right, the way the IRS rules on what is and isn't covered is by explicitly excluding, ergo, if crypto isn't on the list -- and they've had ample opportunity to rule on this -- then it isn't on the list, and it's fair game.
Why amend the tax law to exclude crypto if it was already excluded?

The problem with talking to a tax professional is that they all gave their clients advice to play it safe and treat crypto-to-crypto as a taxable event.
Now that congress has amended the tax law to exclude crypto-to-crypto enjoying like-kind treatment, that advice has been shown to be wrong.
So you're the tax professional that gave this bad advice, what do you do?  Fess up to your mistake?  File for refunds on taxes paid by your clients that they didn't need to pay?
Well... sure, but there's another complication.  This advice greatly constrained the options their clients enjoyed with trading owing to the difference between long-term capital gain tax rates as compared to ordinary rates.  Most if not all of these clients lost boat loads of money by not making the trades they wanted, expressly because of the advice they received.
How does a tax professional compensate his client for bad advice like this?
He doesn't.  He just sticks with the original story, regardless of the mounting evidence showing he was wrong.  No admission of guilt or wrong-doing, no need to make it up to their clients.
And if that means their clients are out of the refunds they're due then so be it.
And if that means the rest of us have to pay taxes we don't owe simply to cover their asses for bad advice given in the past then so be it.
It's exactly that sick.
And it's exactly why we're seeing this army of shills descending on this and every other crypto subreddit spreading this shit.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:40:24

Yes, starting in 2018 it is as you say.  But before that, crypto-for-crypto is like-kind.

@_date: 2017-12-03 17:32:02
Some do, sure.
Others are upset that the rules are so vague, vague to the point where it seems to be deliberate.
Take the question of like-kind exchange.  The IRS rules that crypto is property but then leaves us all hanging on whether 1031 applies.  Now something that was already complicated becomes infinitely more so.  It's not just the question of what tax gets paid that is affected here, but also whether it is long-term vs. short-term capital gains.
It's outrageous, and if the rest of you weren't so adept at always taking it up the ass you'd think so too.

@_date: 2017-12-03 18:14:34
Maybe you should learn how to read.  Nowhere in that guidance is there anything about like-kind exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:37:45


Of course there is.  They explicitly exclude those classes of property exchange which do not qualify for like-kind treatment.  Crypto isn't on that list.
Crypto was never put on that list, even when they ruled that crypto was property back in 2014.
The bottom line is this: you win if you can show me a list from the IRS that explicitly states which property classes qualify for 1031 treatment.
I win if I can show instead the list from the IRS that explicitly states which property classes DO NOT qualify.












I win.

Just curious as to how much money you think Tim Berners-Lee made by creating the web?
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:10:53
This is exactly correct.
And... this is why law enforcement has been so preoccupied with marijuana and methamphetamine in the past; because these are drugs that can be "manufactured" locally, which again deprives the terrorists of their cut, whereas cocaine and heroin are the CIA drugs of choice owing to the fact that organization is required in order to first import the wares and then launder the proceeds.
I would venture to say that if Ross limited himself to the "right" drugs that he would have likely been spared.
