Do you live close to the border. If I were you. Next time. Get it drop shipped to a depot (ex  I use Kinek in Lewiston) and go pick it up yourself. That way you can self clear it and avoid this trouble (not to mention a whole lot of brokerage fees)

Why don't you just use QuadrigaCX. Do you need your BTC instantly?

Money orders through Quadriga don't require verification. 
Also QuickBT is a great alternative that also doesn't require any verification.

I find them reliable. Haven't had any issues in the 4 months that i've been using the service.

Naw.. Still stand by my original post. A little off topic but i'm really surprised anyone in Hollywood still funds his projects.

Updated NPM, and used the new release of BitGoJS and it worked. Thanks for your help.

Not a EASCCES or mkdir error. and i'm running NPM 1.4.28. tried updating but no luck. Looks like it has to do with the node version.

As much as I don't think we really need Coinbase as a middleman money transmitter in Canada, Their presence here may be just around the corner. Noticed that one of their Soft. Eng. will be a panelist at an upcoming bitcoin meetup in Toronto next week. 
But then again, i might be reading too much into this.

Are they still in business. Thought they shutdown...

What about using  
I've personally have never used their service.

Just remembered you can use Purse.io . It takes about 2 days to process.

Thanks but what version of NPM are you using. I have the latest and seem to be getting a lot of ERR messages when trying to install
