I agree with you that the real issue here is a lack of competition. But we're watching a company abusing it's dominance and engaging in practises that would be totally illegal if it weren't for the unregulated nature of crypto.
Part of the free market process, is an informed consumer, and the ability to publicly shame companies who engage in shady dealings.
Coinbase is misleading and screwing over their own customers with fees, and has a CEO with outrageous conflicts of interest.
I just think they deserve to be publicly shamed and called out for it, while your post seemed to be defending them.
But judging by your previous post, we seem to be on the same page!

Then you can always avoid using those services, the protocol is as anonymous as the participants want to make it. You might still need to have an account with Amazon to use their lightning hub, but there will be anonymous nodes as well. There's also the fact that if you're buying a physical item online, then you have to give up your physical identity anyway.


Even if this was true, it would still be way better than our current banks! And it's opt in, so those who are cautious can just wait and see how things go before they jump in.

Someone should make a comic strip of the bitcoin answering by teleporting itself across the world.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:38:30
I'm right there with you.
The problem is, there's such a high barrier to entry for this stuff, that it needs to be pointed out and amplified for the sake of newer investors who can't do their own due diligence.
However, the internet makes talk/lies/propaganda/manipulation very cheap, compared to the money that's at stake here.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:28:31
What we're seeing here is externalisation of costs.
See 
Coinbase have been getting away with causing high fees on the network, and simply passing on those high fees to their customers and blaming the network.
This is what happens when there isn't enough competition, and is a symptom of the centralising effect of large exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:47:41
Roger gives a damn. For branding reasons. Psychologically, it does make a difference what we call things because lay people are very superficial like that.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:53:34


Are you sure about that? The facts dont agree with you in the slightest. Take a look at the image in the original post. Compare the transaction fees of a full bitcoin block against the transaction fees of a full Bcash block.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:31:29
This isn't modifying history though, I'm talking about orphaning the previous commit with another.
And agreed wholeheartedly.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:55:56
It seems to have a huge attack surface, because of the complexities inherit in its design. A lot of alts are the same. We need to keep the base layer dumb and secure and build complexity on top of that.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:50:09


I know what proprietary means. But evidence comes in many forms.


There's the fact that Coinbase employees have appeared on TV and scoffed at the reporters mention of segwit "it's not even in our top 5 service requests". The fact that Coinbase only just placed jobs ads for segwit developers as late as last month. The fact that Armstrong only made a statement this weekend about batching and segwit after his company got caught red handed and publicly shamed.


You can see SegWit implemented in the front end by looking at the Github repo, so you might want to start raising that eyebrow!
Never mind the fact that Segwit in the reference GUI has no relevance to their ability to use it in their back end?


I think it's obvious from their public behaviour.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:11:53


Not according to Brian Armstrong, who admitted they are still working on it.


The CEO has the majority of his investment in ethereum, and publicly roots for the downfall of bitcoin, while actively harming the network with inefficient transactions and contributing nothing to development of the protocol.
And you think it's other people who are deluded, not yourself?
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:45:24


To just store them forever and externalise the cost of said storage to the rest of the network? That's the exact opposite of "getting rid" of the transactions.
How about we make unnecessary and wasteful transactions uneconomical by restricting the size of the block space thereby incentivising the participants to use the space more efficiently?
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:36:28


Yes... It's inconsequential only because of the current block size limit. Seriously think about what you're trying to argue here.


The use of SPV wallets is a weakening of decentralisation. Again your argument is self defeating, as you're indicating how bitcoin is already too centralised.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:14:27
Agreed. They are lacking in their fundamentals, like a poor martial artist.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:00:27


Because it was reprioritised when important work had to be done at the network layer in order to guard against malicious hard forks.
There's code for the GUI available on Github to try by the way. Whereas we have zero evidence of any progress from Coinbase. In fact there's plenty evidence that they're dragging their heels.


I don't think its sensible to compare the work involved in LN with Coinbase switching to a new address and transaction format in order to save their own customers a huge amount of money. One is orders of magnitude more complex than the other.


Then you should be specific rather than just saying "good code takes time". We all know it takes time. But they've had plenty time already.
The question is, are Coinbase acting in good faith and in the best interests of their customers? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:17:47
My crystal ball says: As long as it takes for Bcash to get enough traffic to fill its blocks, or to be spammed.
Unless you have an unlimited HDD to store your unlimited blocks.
You sound about as technically informed as the average Bcash proponent.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:32:52
Hope I didn't hurt your feelings, but until I informed you otherwise you thought that mining hardware had to work harder to mine larger blocks.
I'm telling you that your opinions fly in the face of fact.
Which explains why you don't want to address my points on a technical level.
Again don't take this personally, I mean to insult the ideas, not the individual.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:56:25
I'd much prefer they reverted the commit and kept the git history clean.
I admit some might see it as nit picking, but I do think it shows you have an attention to detail.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:38:50
Be more specific.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:53:19
You'd do well to take a closer look at the conflict of interest that exists between Brian Armstrong, Bitcoin and Ethereum.
At the very least if you don't hold the keys, you own IOUs and not Bitcoin.
If you'd prefer to bury your head in the sand and scoff, then fine, but there are people here trying to help you.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:11:17
I'm pointing out where your logic fails in the hope you can start drawing the right conclusions from the evidence available.
I honestly don't have the time to do your homework for you, there's something we can agree on.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:34:11


Just doing my part to educate the ignorant.
 &gt;You're just reaffirming that there's nothing supporting the centralization argument other than opinions I don't agree with (note: opinions, not facts).
Everything I said was factual. Feel free to correct this.


So by your logic, there is absolutely no point at which blocksize is not inconsequential? Please.


And enforce consensus rules.


Opinion, not fact.


Bitcoin is a technology, not a religion. Stop trying to make a gospel out of the white paper.


Likewise, friend.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:08:38
Your ASICs are hashing against a block header. They have no idea what size the blocks are.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:31:26
Your miner will handle it exactly the same as any other block header it hashes against. I'll repeat myself, your ASICs have no idea of the size of the blocks they are mining.
You're obviously not as informed as you feel you are in regards to how these things work.
Please study more, and you'll realise how half-baked your assertions are.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:47:24
Honestly it depends on the project you're working on, but the most important aspect is how it integrates into your CI process and how you manage merges, releases etc etc.
I don't really have a magic bullet to give you.
Just as an example though, keeping a clean commit history allows you to do cool things like autogenerate release notes from the commit history, and running tests before every merge allows you to bisect on master, without running into failing tests.
I use Gitflow, but lots of people use lots of other workflows as well. Hope that helps you anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:50:37
Haha. We've all got to keep each other honest ;)
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:56:59
Cost of mining depends on a lot of different factors, what assumptions are you making there?
Also transactions being slow and expensive is still an opinion, not a matter of fact. Many people are happy to pay a premium for the level of security that bitcoin offers.
I'm not saying I wouldn't prefer cheap and instant transactions btw... But maybe LN is already priced in by speculators.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:44:36
You're not bringing facts, you're bringing opinions. Yours is one of many.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:06:07


Honestly it sounds like you're busy inventing your own reality for yourself. Your laptop won't last long on the Bcash network the way they're talking. Better start saving up for an expensive server.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:17:31


A major player should also have a much deeper well of experience to draw from, and much more engineering capacity.


Segwit has been available since July, and the software much longer than that. How long should it take? A month? A year?
The fact that Coinbase is operating at scale makes no difference to the features they should be able to offer.
They'll have an ops team working on scalability, and a separate team working on features. Neither should affect the others ability to deliver.
This is not an engineering problem.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:21:50
I remember when we used to talk about proof of reserves and holding the centralised exchanges to account. We seem to have completely dropped our guard in this respect, and now we're waiting for another MtGox to happen.
Coinbase is counting on its customers to be complacent, rather than striving to be world leaders in the technology.
They're actively strangling the golden goose as we speak, and they'll be dining on the silver goose as soon as Brian Armstrong decides hes going to cash out.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:33:31
Show me this tech that literally exists today. This tech which if applied to the bitcoin network would allow for free transactions without massively increasing the projected cost of running a full node.
LN is a thing of course. But let's ignore that for now...
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:54:43
Wishful thinking for BCash apparently ;)
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:27:22


No they absolutely don't have this figured out. The demand for free immutable storage is unbounded.
The problem is much harder than most people realise if you want to keep your currency decentralised.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:31:28


This is not necessarily true at all.
If they're using good software engineering practises, then they have a team working on infrastructure, and an entirely different team working on features. They are both entirely different skill sets.
In the same way, there's no reason why they can't work on implementing segwit at the same time as other features. Don't take my word for it, search for something called *separation of concerns*.
The Coinbase excuses are complete and utter bullshit. Here are two possible explanations:
1) They are incompetent.
2) They have ulterior motives.
Feel free to suggest another.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:43:44
What a reassuring commit message.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:56:58
They are the biggest exchange with huge funding, lots of engineering capacity and massive market influence.
But you want to say segwit is just too complex for them to handle?
They certainly have the money to hire competent devs, if they chose to make it a priority. They just haven't cared to make segwit a priority yet.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:20:36
Downvotes but no rebuttal? The facts are there to be seen but it seems some people are wilfully ignorant.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:02:13
Then you missed my point completely.
Do you think that storing transactions in the blockchain is "getting rid" of them?
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:27:30
If you don't intend to mine them, you simply drop the transactions from the mempool.
The total network cost of saving them on spinning rust is actually quite high.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:31:01


I think you'll find plenty people are using bitcoin just fine. In fact so many people want to use it that the chain is at capacity.
You're claiming that a bus isn't usable because it's always full and the tickets are too expensive for you.
It seems many people are happy to pay a premium in order to hold and transfer value on the most battle-hardened and proven protocol.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:58:15
There's no need to be secretive about your choice of alts. If others agree then you want them on board as well for the network effect right?
Genuinely interested; what do you see as the USP for these coins? By what measure do you compare them against the others?
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:42:57
Correct, it's all the same to your miner.
However if you're running a node then you might feel differently about the viability of unbounded block size.
I know you're being facetious, but you don't know enough to know what you don't know.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:48:53


How long will your laptop last at a rate of 1.6TB per year? Your argument is basically "everything is fine right now, therefore things will be fine in the future". You need to consider that things are only fine right now, because of the historical 1MB limit.


So you're happy if everyone else is priced out of full participation, as long as you can afford an expensive server from your bitcoin millions?


You obviously don't care about decentralisation then. The use of SPV wallets runs contrary to the trustless nature of the protocol. Do you remember when Garzik wanted to trick all the SPV wallets into following Segwit2x?
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:57:17
That's a fair assessment, and I can see exactly where you're coming from.
However they still managed to add BCash in less time, and have a huge amount of funding (and I assume talent) at their disposal.
If they're working on a monolith of ossified spaghetti code, then that's their own making.
When you say "size" in regards to Coinbase I assume you mean software complexity, this is completely unrelated to the concept of *scale* which is what people are using to justify the delay.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:12:35




What? Come on now. Tell me the size of your laptop HDD and we can work it out together.


That's just your opinion, one of many.


You're treating bitcoin as a religion and not as a protocol. Satoshi did a great job on the initial client, but the protocol has been improved and worked on since he left. You want to treat him as some kind of infallible prophet.


@_date: 2018-01-16 00:35:12
So you have no tech to show me, and you ignore the question.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:39:01
The answer to both of your questions is no. I've already said I'm not interested in hearing about people who just cut and paste code or change constants. What exactly do you think qualifies them as experts?
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:44:54
Have you considered it may be miners themselves generating the spam? They certainly profit from the high tx fees.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:08:00
None of the core devs wrote the software? Your assertion doesn't even pass the most basic scrutiny.
You should also learn about the difference between hard and soft forks.
You make a lot of unsubstantiated and weak claims. "The devs can't justify their position". "RBF and segwit are garbage". You're going to need to be a lot more specific than that if you want to form a reasonable argument.
I also couldn't care less what credentials you claim for yourself, your arguments are shallow and ignorant.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:29:32
What if the extra income from the elevated fees compensates for the opportunity cost?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:09:54
I'm saying it's bitcoin because all of the relevant experts agree it's bitcoin. By experts I mean someone who doesn't just cut and paste code or change a const here or there. Why exactly did your opinion of the devs drop?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:33:09
Can you please show me your experts?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:32:38
Roger Ver did refer to Bcash as "my project" in his infamous ragequit. He obviously believes he has influence, control or ownership.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:48:20
You have time to make garbage assertions and insult the competence of the bitcoin devs, but don't have the time to actually justify your claims?
Seems a bit unreasonable...
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:24:29
It didn't remove the signatures, it moved them to another part of the block which is invisible to non-upgraded clients. Educate yourself before spreading disinformation.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:30:56
There are perfectly good engineering reasons to keep the current limit. Quite frankly you've completely failed to justify your position, and you should stop spreading disinformation until you've educated yourself enough to do so. I'll leave it at that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:50:02


This is correct, but it's unreasonable to expect both right now, when the technology doesn't yet exist to make both practical at scale.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:51:33
Who's moving the goalposts? Are you claiming Gavin as a credible authority or not? Maybe you should spend more time listening and reading yourself, rather than bemoaning that no informed person actually takes your opinions seriously.

For the money potentially at stake, they'll be running their own full node. Unlimited queries.

@_date: 2017-12-16 03:28:35
Is there something you don't understand regarding Gavin's reputation? The one that he himself publicly destroyed? You should probably avoid relying on his credibility to support an argument in future.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:42:23
In this case yes. Because Linus maintains the Linux codebase. Ver and co riding on the coattails of the bitcoin developers and then claiming to be the  "official" bitcoin is akin to someone claiming to be Linus and claiming to provide the "official" Linux codebase.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:33:52
Don't grant me quadratic hashing time, because both teams claim to have fixed it.
Consider this: The bitcoin experts realised block validation time was an issue, so they implemented libsecp256k1. They then went and developed segwit which provides linear time signature validation (among many other benefits).
The BCH "experts" simply inherited libsecp256k1 and then changed the max sig ops constant.
Think about it for yourself, who are the real experts, and who are the low effort, cut and paste, const modifying devs?
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:56:54
They are absolutely claiming to be the Bitcoin that the public is discussing. Think about it, the right to determine what bitcoin is, lies collectively with all the developers who actively maintain the software. Why dont you ask some of those contributors with recent activity what they think of the claims of Ver and co?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:39:41


No, it's a loaded question actually.
If you think it's imaginary, then go ahead, close your eyes and imagine it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:15:55
I'm not convinced there aren't other incentives and motivations at play here that aren't directly financial, but I do agree with your logic.
Also agree that we don't have a good definition of what constitutes on-chain spam, because how would we ever decide what is genuine economic activity?
IMO it makes more sense to talk about efficient and inefficient transactions, and this is more of a scale than a binary "spam/not spam" definition.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:14:26
That's a ridiculous comparison, releasing a Linux distro doesn't involve misrepresentation and dirty tricks. I'm sure if someone went around claiming to be Linus Torvalds, the real Linus would be pretty upset.

True. It's orders of magnitude faster though, and infinitely more discreet.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:45:24
Your friend Gavin is also a fan of fake satoshi. I wouldn't be so proud to have the blessing of someone so easily fooled.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:23:14
BCH has never had consistently full blocks, so your comparison is completely bunk. You're ignoring the problem with quadratic block validation time, and the storage costs of running a full node.
If the "obvious" stated goal is what you say, then PayPal has you covered so maybe you should go use that.
The unique value proposition of bitcoin is it's decentralised nature, and the centralisation pressure caused by increasing the block size obviously runs contrary to that.
@_date: 2018-08-10 19:55:37
Just in case anyone is still on the fence about these people, take a look at the role they played in the "Segwit2x" debacle: 
Look at how quickly they supported BCH.
They've shown their true colors, and it's obvious they're no true friend to Bitcoin.

Let's not, that's a ridiculous number.


Completely meaningless comparison don't you think? Maybe you should take into account the number of developers and their competency levels.
Would you mind showing us something tangible so we can see for ourselves?
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:43:05
It's totally possible to hit those numbers. We need way more nodes and users, but you're wrong to say "never".
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:51:59
You're exactly right, but I don't know of any services that do it yet.
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:06:33
If it's not open source, then it's an immediate no-go.
The best projects in the world are working to be more provably correct and secure, publishing code, improving software development practices and doing things like Formal Verification.
Those are just some of the more technical things that make a project "good" (imho).
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:48:18
I didn't miss anything. Just thought you should reconsider your outlandish claims.
Also both plasma and raiden are both fairly derivate of lighting, and lighting is already way ahead in terms of actual progress.
If you like the look of FunFair then fair play to you, but there scarce few *developers* who are actually doing anything revolutionary in terms of real technological breakthroughs (never mind teams).
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:32:46

The P2P network is undoubtedly 99% core client. I'm talking about address and wallet management.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:41:46
Possibly. My point is it has no bearing at all on the superiority of one over the other, which is what was being claimed.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:08:25
He's also done more bad to crypto than most others. It would be nice to see Coinbase contribute a little more to Bitcoin Core or the community in general. If Brian would pay more attention to his technical team and less to his CEO pals that would be great too.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:15:05
So the reason is address management? Still doesn't sound like a convincing excuse to me. I personally wouldn't trust a company that needed to be spoon fed like this.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:56:22
So you guys think Coinbase are storing their customer funds in a wallet.dat file? Get real.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:12:46
Consider that Adam Back's early work on hashcash was designed as a protection against email spam. The intention was to make spam too expensive to generate. Right now certain individuals can spam the network very cheaply due to mining centralisation (and BCash mining is even more centralised).
The only long term solution is decentralisation of mining, which will come in the form of either POW change or commoditization (once the technology hits its physical limits). In the mean time, we have to accept that those with deep pockets, or those who profit from mining fees have the means to price other people's transactions out of the market.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:21:36
Competent developers would never cite a lack of GUI as an excuse for not implementing segwit. It's been fully available via RPC for a while now. More likely they're having the same issues as the bitcoin developers themselves, being forced to focus on guarding against all the recent drama, rather than working on new features.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:17:49
Absolute nonsense. If an exchange/wallet is relying on the bitcoin core client for their address management then you should NOT be trusting them with your money.

Because if the miners started spamming BCash it wouldn't have the same problem?
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:44:53
Your point is invalid. BCash isn't magically immune to spam attacks by the miners. Study more.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:30:26
You seriously think they're using the core client to handle their wallets and generate payment addresses?
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:25:33
My point is if they're writing secure financial software, then they should be capable of managing their own addresses also. Yours is an argument for testing, which they should be doing regardless. To be clear, I do think they're capable. They're either distracted or unwilling.
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:48:48
Yes but the new features are incredibly well tested, and by not upgrading you're foregoing known bug fixes.
Just to clarify what I mean, it's bugs we already know about that are going to cause you issues on the network level. At least the bugs not yet discovered "probably" haven't been found by an adversary either.

I don't understand the reasoning behind this.
I don't think the ratio of bugs fixed / bugs introduced should be much different between a major release vs a minor release, all things considered.

I'm going to have to disagree with you.


The scaling problem was caused by the behaviour of the network participants, not the network protocol.
Now that a few very big participants have decided to clean up their usage of the network (batching and segwit) you'll notice the network fees have returned to reasonable levels.
A few things went wrong:
1) we had a huge influx of new and less informed users
2) the most popular exchanges were very inefficient in their use of the protocol, and simply passed on the cost to their customers
3) social media attacks blaming bitcoin rather than encouraging the exchanges to get working and use the scaling solutions available to them
We should be reassured that bitcoin is still proving resilient to these attacks.

Would be nice to see Snowden make a few pull requests.

Someone will eventually implement this to be P2P at the network level.
Plus, as soon as a few competitors pop up these services should get squeezed on their fees.

Can I have a citation for that please? Interested in seeing the calculations.

Also, don't forget that the usual suspects own and run a Twitter shilling service.
They couldn't be any more blatant.

Let's hope they're forever drowned in merge conflicts.

It's unfortunate that you're being downvoted, when you're absolutely right.

MtGox had a Barclays bank account.

I agree, it's a free market and development, hosting, customer support all cost money. However the fact remains that cross chain atomic swaps could be implemented as a free app on your phone, there's more incentive (more money to be made) for people to run a service and collect fees. It's a shame, in a way.

The reference implementation of bitcoin. Reference implementations allow the protocol to be defined in code, rather than ambiguous spoken languages. This is central to the concept of consensus, and "code is law". Other projects fail completely in this regard, see ethereum and the dao.
Btw it's worth mentioning that Gavin Andresen pushed for the name change from "bitcoin" to "bitcoin core", while others argued it had the potential to cause confusion...

A good fee calculation strategy involves using RBF to bump the fee in response to changing mempool conditions.
BitPay are trying to manipulate the fee market, by removing the senders ability to participate freely.

I was hoping it was a typo :D

My point is, the price of these services are going to be reduced to the marginal cost in the long run. Do you disagree with my original statement somehow?

1) Insider trading and market manipulation (re: surprise introduction of Bcash).
2) Blaming the bitcoin network for high fees while spamming with inefficient transactions.
You can't wave Occam's Razor around like it excuses all of these actions. Just look at the behaviour of your own CEO.
So many conflicts of interest.

Garzik is an enemy to the fungibility of Bitcoin.
But we're already working on destroying your business model, with confidential transactions and other privacy features, so thanks for the motivation Jeff!

You can run whatever code you want, but nobody else is obliged to follow your chain.
