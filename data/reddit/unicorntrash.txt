You pay fees for both, at least your bank does. They just somehow value you you enough as customer that they take the costs on them. This is fundamentally different from no fees.

I am trying to get my hand on such a card for quite a while now. Can you name me a single one that actually sends out cards and not only places you on a mailing list?

They exchange BTC to the current EUR value on deposit. This is not exactly a Bitcoin depit card.

This is a very limited POV. I earn _some_ of my income in Crypto (nothing of which was exchanged just to pay me). I never know how much i will earn in FIAT or Crypto the next day. I also only have very few fixed costs i have to pay. 
Converting my crypto to fiat just in case in make less fiat that month or visa verse creates unecessary costs for me. Having both on hand however i need it right now would still be the most cost efficient even thought the associated fees. 
Next to that this would make it much less painful for which i happily pay a little extra. And i am certain there are even more legit use cases, even if its just being crypto rich and lazy.

I am on at least 20 waiting lists for these cards by now. No it hasnt been released, it just opened yet another shitty waiting list... :/

Cool! But do you agree that the numbers show that it is most likely just yet another HYPD? It looks so legit, but i doubt it is in the long term.
