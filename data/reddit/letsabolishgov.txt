Some of bitcoiners actually think redistribution of wealth is good, but printing money is evil. Printing money is a way to redistribute the wealth. So why are they here? I recommend them to go r/soCiaLisMiSsOgOOd.

If you can't pay your taxes with bitcoin, you don't pay taxes. Fixed.

When a recession happens, generally, asset prices go down. But "i think" this time is a little bit different. Because central bank rates are almost zero. When a recession comes, "i think" they will try negative rates. If such a thing happens, people will rush into market and buy real things. They will want get rid of fiat money. I think bitcoin is one of these "real things".

When all fiat moneys die,
when there is no taxation, monetary or fiscal policy
when there is no restrictions on any market
when there is no government intervention...
This is my moon.

All these crypto things have not "much" mean, since gov can hit you with its club anytime it wants.

I use bitcoin core. It is a full node, and you can use it as wallet. By running bitcoin core, you can store bitcoins, and you can help the bitcoin network.

I think you are trying to say taxation is good, but inflation is evil. Here what i say, there is no difference. They are both evil.

Folks choose to live in weimar republic and they paid taxes. But this did not prevent collapse of weimar mark. It will not prevent the others.

A huge monopoly on violence, man with guns, prisons that you cannot ever escape vs. some crypto thing. I would bet on gov.

Nothing is wrong with private banks and their private currencies. I am saying that because, private businesses are not coercive. They don't dictate you to use their money. Just like, nobody dictates using bitcoin.
But government dictates what money you are going to use. If you don't accept they put you in prison. [

Money is not only medium of exchange. It is also a unit of account. But bitcoin is not a unit of account. We all doing our economic calculations with our local currency, then turn prices into bitcoin. Bitcoin is not unit of acount, so it is not money. (yet)
