It seems that you didn't read my post or didn't understand.
The social contract is the CONSENSUS CODE that the network runs. That has not been changed since Satoshi left. 
All other opinions, marketing, what she said, bullshit about scaling to Visa levels (whomever you heard it from) are nothing more than opinions, conjecture or speculation. The protocol does not care about any of these, it follows the Code it is running and as far as it is concerned, anything higher than 1MB is not Bitcoin.
Regarding Greg, he has done more for Bitcoin than anyone else in this world after Satoshi left, so if you cannot respect him for that, thats your personal opinion. He did not point a gun at your head to force you to run Bitcoin-Core. You are free to use Ripple if you want cheap transactions, it will always be cheaper because it is centralised and does not need POW. 
But as far as im concerned, Bitcoin will not become another Ripple so that coffee can be paid on chain.

If you can't pay for the security, it doesn't get in on the chain. Someone has to pay for the hashing. Bitcoin is not socialism.

It is not artificial, it is a security parameter which keeps an upper bound on the cost to run a full node and also keeps mining centralisation in check.

I would actually say that for a business, a full node is a necessity. Especially if its an online service where you will be receiving payments from total strangers.
Today, because the block subsidy is high, miners don't screw around. But i wouldn't be surprised if in the future when subsidy drops greatly, attacking exchanges and businesses using SPV wallets with fake blocks with fake bitcoins will be far more profitable than mining honestly.

3rd party? Lol, the gross stupidity on reddit never ceases to surprise me.
@_date: 2015-12-03 15:10:54
Well that shouldnt be too hard.
Given the avg 300k txns/day with 1MB, we get about 110 million txns a year. So if we just need to get each new user a UTXO, after which they transact over lightning or hodl, we can onboard about 100million ppl a year.
Considering that the total number of Bitcoin users we have after 7 years is well below 10 million, 1MB is not going to be hindering anyone from obtaining a utxo anytime soon. Ofc, lightning is not ready yet, so txns have to happen onchain for now and a small bump now is reasonable should blocks start getting full consistently.
A quick analysis over the current utxo set shows less than 2 million utxo entries with 0.01 BTC (&gt; $3.6), of which multiple are probably owned by the same person. Which is not surprising as many people choose to hold their coins on centralised services like exchanges/coinbase despite the advice of the community. This is unlikely to change until more Gox events happen and people learn the hard way, which may take many years.
@_date: 2015-12-21 13:40:05
I have run Bitcoin Core on very low powered single core hardware before and it barely uses 5% - 10% most of the time (after syncing obviously). Also there are many who run it on Raspberry pi's, so if i had to guess the usage is likely to do with BitCore related packages instead of Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:28:14
Exactly THIS!
Id be surprised if the actual trade economy of Bitcoin is even $70 million. There has been research into analysing blockchain data which shows that the vast majority of coins are being hoarded(Demand), which is what gives Bitcoin its value and $7b market cap which also happens to have a TPS requirement of uhm 0. 
What's criminal is crying wolf over hypothetical end of the world scenarios. As if he has not learnt anything from Mike Hearn's attempt.
@_date: 2015-12-22 17:21:03
For a start, have a look at Bitfury's paper where they discuss RAM and bandwidth figures as block size increases. They estimate that 50% of full nodes would drop out at 2MB full block sizes.
Selfish mining  
This can implicitly happen with larger blocksizes as blocks are unable to reach smaller miners fast enough, wasting their hashpower and reducing their income/ths, eventually causing them to fail and cause centralisation.
Peter Todd explains this here:
You should also watch both the Scaling Bitcoin conferences, there are many academic speakers from Universities who are not code contributors to Bitcoin. 
Also consider for a moment that the smartest people in Bitcoin would not be against increasing Blocksize if it was a non-issue.
IBLT and Relay Network break down in adversarial conditions, a miner who wants to selfish mine can include txns which are not public and purposely make the relay schemes irrelevant.


Except the exact opposite has happened as more and more Bitcoin companies used 3rd parties like chain.com 


2 pools control 50% of the hashrate is not centralised enough?
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:36:45
You also have to consider the alternative view which i take.
I see the difficulty to change Bitcoin as its greatest advantage. We have a currency which works, has solid economic principles (fixed supply), currently decentralised, etc... Difficulty to change Bitcoin also ensures that these valued traits are also difficulty to change. This gives Bitcoin a certain level "hardness" which is perhaps only exceeded by gold in the currencies realm.

Just to correct the misconception, SW does not require less data in any sense. 2mb of transactions will still require 2mb of bandwidth, 2mb of disk space on a full node. Its more of a hack where we move the signature data out of a block and transmit that separately, allowing more txns to fit in 1mb of block size. 
The primary benefits have more to do with solving malleability, avoiding a hard fork and other potential benefits like fraud proofs than scalability
@_date: 2015-12-20 03:23:35

@_date: 2015-12-22 10:07:38
It's not artificial. 
Larger block sizes increase orphans, centralise mining, implicitly cause selfish mining, increase full node requirements thereby reducing node counts and in summary weaken the integrity of the currency by weakening it's decentralisation. All of these claims are backed up by data from research, miners, historical data.
@_date: 2015-12-21 08:23:02
All thats left is SW and CSV, both of which are non-controversial and are likely to be soft-forked in the near future.
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:51:06
Yup i understand those, it could significantly reduce the bandwidth required for new nodes to sync up, but my point was more referring to the reasons for objecting to larger blocks, mainly decentralisation of miners and nodes.
Some qsns:
1) Regarding fraud proofs, would SPV nodes have to request fraud proofs explicitly from full nodes wrt to the txn they wish to check? 
2) How does more txn prevent the flooding of UTXO set? Couldnt i create additional outputs with the additional space?
Also, though this is not voiced as often, there are ppl in the community who value the direction and work of the "conservative" devs who value the security and decentralisation of Bitcoin more than headlines, VC money and Visa level txns. Its just that we are not as loud, but thank you for all your hard work and persistence in not wavering from Bitcoin's fundamental values. 
Because we understand that at the end of the day an insecure currency is worth 0 regardless of its scale.
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:40:47

Nobody owes the masses anything, SPV wallets today function only because of the altruism of people running full nodes. If i need to spend thousands of dollars on a high end rig/power/net connection, why should i let the masses leech off my full node?
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:30:50


Last i checked, the economic majority are still running Core nodes. 
99%+ miners are still mining with Core consensus.
Litecoin with 4x the capacity and almost free transactions is worth 3% of Bitcoin.
So no, transaction fees have almost nothing to do with the value of a coin.


The only social contract that matters is the code which you are running, which for the vast majority of us is after Satoshi put in the 1MB cap. And even if you were around before the 1MB cap, you continuing to use Bitcoin after the 1MB cap was an agreement with the new rules.
 By definition, any hard fork is the breaking of the social contract promised by Bitcoin because it alters the meaning of what a Bitcoin is, which was defined by Satoshi in the reference client.
Anything else that Hearn and friends may have told you, or the BS you read on the wiki about Bitcoin scaling to Visa levels(also written by Hearn) was conjecture at best.

Yes, we should not follow everything Satoshi said blindly, for all his genius, he could not have forseen the future and new developments like pooled mining, lightning, selfish mining attacks, etc.. 
But in this case, he was clear that a single blockchain cannot accommodate every use case, which if you think about it, is pretty common sense. You cant have the entire internet on 1 server either. Note that this was way back in 2010 when blocks were almost entirely empty.
What is also interesting is that he did in some way forsee the current blocksize debate


@_date: 2015-12-25 05:01:38
Putting everything in 1 chain is just insane, we already have scaling issues handling Bitcoin transactions and you are worried about dumping other uses onto the same chain, further driving up costs for full nodes and the entire ecosystem.

Offchain trustless transactions(over payment channels and lightning) are still bitcoins. There is no IOU involved as actual signed bitcoin txns are used throughout.
The main difference is that they are not pushed to the blockchain until either party wants to reuse the coins for other purposes which the current channel cannot serve.
@_date: 2015-06-10 03:07:56


So lets remove the block cap, let it grow to 1TB, so that the masses can buy coffee on the blockchain.
What happens when only Google-sized corporations can afford to run nodes/mining pools? 
Even if the threat of competition keeps them in check from bad behaviour, how are you going to prevent the government from regulating them and forcing them to bow to their whims? 
If the entire bitcoin network is verified and run by a dozen of large corporations, its effectively no different than the current banking system.
@_date: 2015-12-22 08:35:49
Note, i said onchain. If for some weird reason your $5 txn has to be onchain, there are other cheaper chains you can use.
Otherwise if you wish to use Bitcoin, there are always various offchain solutions
@_date: 2015-12-05 05:48:12
Thats not how it works. 
As far as what LN needs, it only needs the blockchain to establish a channel with an endpoint or hub. Assuming cashflow is balanced in both directions, the number of txns is infinite. Once in awhile, a peer may close the channel (ie to whisk away earnings in cold storage) or open a new channel (spent all the money and need to tap on cold storage). This is what the blockspace will be used for and therefore it needs to be large enough to allow new users to open and existing users to close channels. Given that a LN like system has never existed before, we do not know at this time how frequent channels will be opened or closed.
What is likely to happen in the long run is people opening channels would be the equivalent of opening a bank account today, you do it once in a decade. Once u have a channel, all your salary and payments are done through the channel. The benefits are much lower fees, instant confirmation. Once in awhile when you have surplus funds, you move the funds to a cold storage address onchain.
@_date: 2015-06-10 03:06:12
Yes, i agree with you on this. And imo the camp opposed to the 20MB fork wants the issue of declining full nodes and scalability  addressed before raising the blocksize.

@_date: 2015-12-05 04:36:19
That is assuming 7 billion people using Bitcoin and with the assumption that channels would have a lifespan of a year.
However, an improvement to the protocol allowing perpetual channels will mean that at 1MB, Bitcoin can onboard 70 million people every year. Considering that we dont even have 7 million people using Bitcoin today, it is unlikely that blocksize will be an issue once LN is available.
@_date: 2015-12-12 15:50:19
Yet there are retards in the world who want to increase blocksize significantly more. I mean who needs full nodes? Just trust the miners
@_date: 2015-12-20 05:32:01
Think of it this way, its no different from stake in a company. The people who have the most invested have a higher weighting, after all they care more about Bitcoin to have invested so much and have so much skin in the game.
Idiots with their 2 bitcents clamoring for larger blocks so they can pay for coffee do not matter, their opinion is worthless. They are not invested in bitcoin in any significant way, they are just here to leech off the subsidy to make cheap transactions and wish to keep it cheap by destroying the currency's security and decentralization. They donnot care if Bitcoin goes to 0, they do not hold any significant amounts, all they care about is to leech off the system.
Also it is in the interest of any large holder to preserve the value of the currency over cost to transact, ie security and decentralisation. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 10:01:01


Check out Bitfury's paper on blocksizes, they did plenty of research with data to show how node counts are expected to fall as the block size increases. 
There is also data showing how rates of orphan increase as block size increases which together with the selfish mining paper demonstrate that larger miners will be more profitable than their relative hashrate. ie If you have 20% of hashrate, you will mine 22% of blocks, leading to an unfair advantage which naturally pushes towards centralisation as your profitability is higher than it should be.

However, there is plenty stopping someone from starting another paypal.com/bank/currency.

@_date: 2015-06-16 07:44:06


Actually its the opposite, a lightning hub will probably have to run a full node due to the way a hub works in the lightning protocol. For every sender sending x BTC, a hub has to have x BTC of its own coins already in a channel to the receiver/routing hub. There is plenty to lose for the hub if someone double spends against it. This could be mitigated by requiring more confirmations for opening a channel with the hub.
More importantly, a lightning hub has to look out for uninformed channel closing by the receiver on the blockchain, so that it can obtain the secret and claim it's payment from the sender before the channel times out. This requires monitoring all transactions on the network. And if you are going to monitor all txns, you might as well run atleast a pruned node and get the extra security against invalid transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:01:54


t will always be &gt;= n
The number of transactions will always be more than the node count simply because there are multiple txns per node, SPV wallets which are not even a full node but can and do create transactions, web wallets...
O(n*t) = O(n^2) where t &gt;= n
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:20:13
Ah, but what im implying is that increasing the block size to maintain low fees will eventually result in increasing the coin limit, because txn fees will be insufficient to secure the coin.

Raising the blocksize is not scaling the protocol, its merely kicking the can down the road. Its no different than raising the debt ceiling or QE to keep the system going just a little longer.
Decentralized systems do not scale as well as centralized systems, precisely because they are decentralized, each additional node adds cost to society but provides decentralization in return, preventing the drawbacks of centralized systems like fiat currencies have (money printing, blacklisting, account freezing, transaction limitations).
Raising blocksizes to scale for worldwide payments will result in multi-gigabyte blocks, resulting in a handful of major corporations being able to run the network. Guess what happens then.
The majority of the core developers acknowledge the fact that Bitcoin does not scale in its current form, innovative solutions like blockchain pruning, UTXO commits, trustless offchain (see lightning) have to be developed and deployed before raising the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:46:07
Serious question.
Instead of paying for things, why not make everything free altogether?
As i understand it, this limit is entirely self-imposed, if there was no need to pay, nobody would be poor or have to go hungry.
TLDR: Higher block sizes leads to more centralization as running a full node becomes less attractive/feasible which will inevitably lead to Bitcoin being no different from the current financial system where we have to trust a few supernodes with validating/verifying transactions.

The alignment only stands as long as mining is an even playing field where X% of hashpower gives you X% of reward.
Raising the blocksize makes the equation X% of hashpower == X% + Y% of reward, where Y is negative for smaller miners and positive for larger miners.

10 min. average block interval (or a reduction in block-interval time). A 4MB
block size corresponds to a maximum throughput of at most 27 transactions/sec.

Atleast with Bitcoin you literally have a fighting chance to keep it decentralised and fulfill the dream you have. 
Every disaster is an opportunity in disguise. 
If there is ever a hostile fork, with or without miner majority, it will be a great opportunity to dump the pretender coin for Bitcoin. Increasing your wealth at the expense of the idiots. Not only will you be wealthier, you would also financially destroy those who are wrong. If you are right about the view that capital will eventually flow to the more secure and decentralised coin, what do you have to fear other than short term volatility?  The number of people advocating decentralisation may very well be a minority, but the bitcoins they hold are likely to be the majority, which is why they recognised the true value of Bitcoin and got into it long before anyone accepted it as payment.

Erik, i think it is very naive of you to think that in any system everyone will be happy, more so in a complex setup like Bitcoin where the desires of each group are in direct contrast with the other.
Users want free/cheap transactions but do not want to pay for security (more hashing), cheap (larger blocks).
Miners want more revenue via block rewards (more inflation), fees (more txn fees).
Holders want an inflation-free currency(no reward), decentralised/censorship resistant(smaller blocks).
IMHO, BTC price will be weak as long as socialists/terrorists keep threatening to fork bitcoin.  And the only reason that a hardfork is even viable today is because the ecosystem is already too centralised. 5 guys control 75% of hashpower and can hold the currency hostage. It is not very difficult to bribe/threaten/force 5 people for a small amount of resources.

Your numbers seem to be way off.
Given that the average peak capacity of the 1MB blocks is about 340k txns a day, it comes to about 10.37 million txns a month, ~125 million txns a year. At 4MB, that is about half a billion txns.
In the long run, when the entire economy functions on LN, I don't even see why anyone would need to open channels more often that you open a bank account. You open a channel, you use it to send and receive payments. If the routing protocol is anything like IP routing today, there is absolutely no need to close and reopen channels. Payments will find a way to one of your open channels due to intense competition amongst everyone to route your payment. 
Add in other factors like sidechains, nobody in China is going to use Bitcoin for payments because they have centralised private payment systems light years ahead of the world, offchain txns between exchange to exchange (ie. Coinbase), future innovations, etc.. Then no, i think the future is very very bright and you are worrying too much.

The loss will occur to anyone on the lower valued chain. 
Eg 
* Merchant still on original chain. 
* Hard fork happens and mkt values new chain higher
* User splits his coins to different addresses on each chain via doublespending on 1 of the chains
So he has old coins on address A, new coins on address B
* User pays merchant with lower valued coins from A
* Merchant tries to sell his coins and realises that there is a fork and his coins are lower valued than claimed BTC rate.
or vice versa if old coins are valued more, although in this scenario the receiver knew what he was doing by risking to upgrade.
There is also an outsized risk to exchanges who choose to upgrade exclusively and it so happens that the old chain lives on or the new chain loses support. They could face legal consequences from customers who will only get the new coins while forfeiting the old coins. 
So regardless of what your position is, everyone should get their coins off any exchange prior to any hardfork event.

My example was referring to a merchant who does not visit reddit or read up on Bitcoin news everyday. Classic is proposing a hardfork with a notice period of a few months (~3 months from what i can determine).
As far as full nodes are concerned, the longest chain is what your node recognises as valid coins. Core nodes will reject Classic blocks regardless of how long they are, vice versa for Classic. 
Blockchain/bitpay/coinbase will refer to whatever node they are running. So if they choose wrongly, and you depend on them, you will lose out. 
In the event that both chains survive, you will still lose out on the chain that they choose not to support and honour.

This will likely be in direct corelation to onchain fees, the higher the fees, the more offchain txns will draw ppl.


The chart ends in 2012. Also, computing performance for PCs has definitely not improved anywhere near the slope shown in the chart. Performance benchmarks for every iteration of intel's processors show 5-15% improvements at best.


The fact that people do not use a node because of sync times or HD space or excessive bandwidth usage is a problem. If you are not using a node for receiving coins, you are just trusting hashrate.
This will become extremely clear should the BU fork happen, receivers using SPV wallets will lose plenty of money as the wallet will be unable to tell 1 chain from the other and blindly trust hashrate.


a) Then people will just use a central node like coinbase.
b) Customers already pay mining fees, none of that goes to nodes.


Which already is not the case at 1MB, many bitcoin businesses rely on chain.com for node services.

This is not a huge problem. It is possible for smaller payment hubs to co-exist with larger ones as a payment can be routed by a smaller hub through a larger hub if it does not have a direct connection with the payee. Sort of like how the Internet works today with the various tiers of ISPs.

LN alone will potentially give 100x scaling in the long run once the channel network grows organically over time.

That fork had full consensus as it was due to a bug in BDB. 
It did not change any economic properties of Bitcoin. 
Increase in blocksize directly affects future security of the blockchain and the currency. We are almost 75% through the inflation subsidy but fees are only covering 1% of miner revenue, when are we going to increase fees to pay for the hashing? Continue kicking the can until 2140? 
Increasing the blocksize too fast is ultimately no different than QE and a moral hazard. It subsidises parasitical transactions at the cost of decentralisation and encourages unsustainable businesses operating. 
If decentralisation does not matter to you, why did you invest in Bitcoin over Ripple? Ripple has a fixed supply as well.

It's already functional on testnet, only thing keeping it back on mainnet is lack of Segwit.


Except there has been virtually no meaningful hardware advancement in the past 5 years. The single core performance difference between a decade old midrange Core 2 duo and the latest generation i5 is barely 100% (2x increase). Core counts have only gone from 2 to 4, so a total of 4x over an entire decade. Yet, the blockchain continues to grow every day even without a blocksize increase, time for syncing would have been a month today if using earlier versions of Bitcoin-Qt. The only reason we can sync in a couple of days today is the aggressive optimisation via libsecp256k1 and lower security assumptions where we skip signature checking via checkpoints and assumevalid mode.
Disk space growth has stalled too, with average HD sizes of 500GB in 2007 to 1TB-2TB today. With the trend towards SSDs and cloud storage, this number goes back to 500GB.
Satoshi cannot be blamed for not having forseen this, 2008 was just the beginning of the end of rapid hardware advancements which had been going on for the past 2 decades.


Personally i think that even doubling of the blocksize to 2MB is extremely aggressive and reckless. The blockchain is ever growing and without hardware advancement, the cost to sync a new node trends ever higher and discourages new nodes from coming online.


By protocol definition, all hard forks result in an altcoin. People are free to fork off.

Any increase is a reduction in decentralization, be it in full validation or mining.
The debate is ultimately about the level of decentralization that is desired. People who see bitcoin as a payment system dont care for decentralization as long as it is cheap, vice versa for those who see it as a store of value.
I think Bitcoin is already far too centralised and the cost of using a full node is already far too high. Merely doubling tps is not going to bring any significant benefit vs the loss of decentralization.

Erik, any hard forks are by technical definition alt-coins.
If Bitcoin-Classic was a client changing the coin limit, it would be an alt-coin because the current protocol would reject it, just as it would reject any block larger than 1MB. 
The insistence on non-controversial consensus is very important. Unless everyone agrees to a change, there will be a fork and people receiving money on the wrong side of the fork will lose out as they are paid in lower valued coins. Hard forks should not be done without ample notice and full consensus.
What Gavin has done is release a new project which will fork the network without any new proposals, concrete details or discussions. Had he written a BIP instead and proposed it, it would have been a non-issue.  
The difficulty of hard forks is a feature of Bitcoin which defines it's hardness. Gold is hard because Man cannot change any of its properties regardless of how much he dislikes them. If a small group of people can conjure enough support among the masses and  successfully fork Bitcoin despite not having full consensus and having valid arguments against forking, then Bitcoin is no different than fiat currencies. Today it is the block size, tomorrow it will be the coin limit when the block subsidy runs out.

You shouldn't comment about things you have no clue of.


Anyone with coins can be a node. The very fact that coins are required to be committed for every channel guarantees that no one player can have a monopoly over the hub business simply because their capital is limited. Even Satoshi with his alleged 1 million coins will be limited to 5% of all lightning transactions routed through him. And that is as big as it gets.


Bitcoin is not a credit based system. You need bitcoins before you can spend it either onchain or offchain.


That is like saying you need to have a monthly internet subscription with every site you visit, so everyone will just subscribe to Google since it is the largest. 


You seriously are clueless. The WHOLE POINT of lightning is to create a channel once and use it for multiple payments via routing. Channels to any node with good uptime are likely to remain open for very long or even indefinitely.

Its is very naive to expect an attack after fork. Each block spent attacking core is a block less for BU. Not to mention alot of money down the drain as mined coins wont be worth anything after an attack. 
There have been no mining attacks on etc despite their miniscule hashrate. Simply because it does not make financial sense to do so. A 6 block reorg alone could cost anywhere from 50k to a few million depending on luck in getting a 6 block streak. Each failed attempt would be money down the drain. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:46:47
The primary reason Bitcoin is not as immutable as we would like is because mining is already too centralised. 7 ppl control block generation for 90% of the worlds mining hash power. It is trivial to deceive, bribe or threaten them to do an attacker's bidding as Classic has demonstrated.
As the inflation subsidy vanishes, i expect miners in the future to start fighting to change the supply cap to keep their mines going. And i hope for Bitcoin's sake, we would have found and implemented a solution to this problem by then.
This can be fixed over time via a variety of innovations /companies/competition but it will take time.

None of this nonsense is going to happen. Rizun is not king and obviously lacks the intellect to see the stupidity of his proposal.
The brilliance of POW is that any action requires resources, whether it is to build atop a chain or to attack another. And you can only do 1 at a time.

@_date: 2016-01-03 15:15:42
Sure, but you never know what you are buying or selling. Your SPV wallet software trusts random nodes on the network which present you POW. 
It is entirely feasible that you end up using an altcoin with the same network protocol as Bitcoin but with different economic properties (no fixed supply currency). 
Or you could be receiving fake money (Bitcoins which do not exist on the blockchain) because the node you are trusting said so.
Your wallet wouldn't know the difference.
The only reason this does not happen today is because the inflation subsidy is large enough to keep miners hashing on the Bitcoin blockchain. But it is not guaranteed, especially so in the future if transaction fees are not substantial enough.

Since you cant even use Google, let me give u a brief overview.
So you want to start mining and blocks are 2MB. Toonmin's data last year showed that 1MB blocks are taking upto 30s to propagate to a significant number nodes, especially cross-GFW.
Now at 2MB, you take 1 minute to download the latest block. During that 1 minute while everyone near the block finder was hashing away, you were sitting there wasting power on the older block. So now u have a 10% handicap vs the big miners. For every dollar you invest in mining, you will get 90% of the payout of what a big miner will get for his dollar.

Actually it does drastically reduce bandwidth, thereby increasing propagation speeds.
In the high bandwidth mode, it also reduces latency unless a block with non-public txns is mined. This can be a problem as there are miners who mine exclusive txns which are not broadcast to the public network. 
But you are right that it does not affect downloading of historical blocks, which afaik is still CPU limited in most cases.

Casper eventually devolves to a trust model.
If you are a new node starting up, how do you know which is the valid chain? In POW, you just calculate the chain with most work. You do not need to trust anyone! An alien could come to earth and download Satoshi's original bitcoin client and be on the right chain.
 For POS, there is nothing at stake, meaning it does not cost anything to create more/longer chains. Casper basically solves this by "weak subjectivity" which is smokescreen for trusting others to tell you which is the right chain. 
Ask yourself about the security deposits. Who determines who cheated and who was honest? It is not mathematically possible to determine this unlike POW.

Would you still be sending $100 if fees were $1?
Every increase in fees prices out the lowest value transactions or at the very least nudges the sender to optimise their transaction (ie multi-pay in 1 txn vs 1 txn for each payment). 
Once fees rise sufficiently, they will incentivise off-chain solutions, be it 3rd party services or lightning.

The higher the price of BTC, the more value that is being moved in the network and the more security is required.

There is nothing you can do if the coins were sent by a third party for now. This will change once CPFP rolls out in the near future where you can try to spend an unconfirmed output with higher fees

You simply mine for a proof that releases the coins on the main Bitcoin chain. Basically it is a 51% attack on the sidechain. 
Unlike Bitcoin, where a 51% attack cannot steal coins, only change the order of txns. A 51% attack on sidechains takes the coins locked up on the Bitcoin chain. Bitcoin full nodes do not know or care if the sidechain rules were followed. This makes attacking sidechains with large amounts of coins on them a no-brainer. 
Thus the only secure method to do a sidechain for now is to use federated pegs, which is really not a big deal for low value high volume usage.

Technically that was not a hard fork(protocol rules wise) , it was a bug in the DB configuration. The original Satoshi client with the right DB configuration would still be on the same chain today.
@_date: 2016-06-17 13:49:47
My point is that you could run 0.3 today with DB configs fixed and still be on the same chain, so it isn't really a hardfork.

Why Satoshi put the limit in place does not change the effect of the action.
Why Satoshi put that limit in place 6 years ago has little relevance to the situation today. Satoshi never imagined pooled mining, which has entirely changed the landscape of mining and greatly amplified centralisation pressures. We cannot prevent pooled mining, but we can at the very least keep mining a level playing field by reducing barriers to entry and keeping 1 hash = 1 share of mining rewards as close as possible.

@_date: 2016-06-10 14:09:58
So if im reading this right, pretty much for the vast majority of blocks, your node already had every txn in the mempool and did not require an additional fetching of txns(except 2 blocks where you had to download 1 txn). 
Meaning latency was 0.5 RTT and bandwidth usage was a mere 20KB!
@_date: 2016-06-08 05:34:30
1) When mining, every 6s reduces your revenue by 1%. Considering how competitive it is, 30s or 5% handicap is more than enough to kill any miner. And the whole point of decentralisation is to have more independent smaller miners instead of single large pools/mining firms, who are most affected by latency. Requiring at 1Gbps connection from a Tier 1 ISP to even get started mining inevitably forces smaller miners into large pools who can afford it.
Also you seem to have no clue on the difference between stated bandwidth and actual bandwidth. You can have a 1Gbps link in California, but you still would be crawling at 100kbps to China because of GFW or struggling at 1Mbps to Malaysia simply because the bandwidth from your ISP to overseas points is too low. Don't believe me? Do a test on speedtest to Europe and various parts of Asia.
2) These require other miners to also use them, which is almost non-existent for all the protocols you highlighted. The exception is FRP which is operated by 1 entity and a central point of failure.
3) Blocksize has alot to do with mining centralisation. You should read the Cornell paper on selfish mining which implicitly happens with larger blocks. Also this Microsoft paper on block propagation, 


size costs an additional 80ms delay until a majority knows
about the block.
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:11:12
I see your point.
But id like to point out that the blocksize is a consensus rule. Where as an alternative Bitcoin implementation not using BDB following 0.3.1's rules would be fine.

It is not widely possible to transmit 1 MB within 6 seconds between continents. Much of the advertised bandwidths are only valid for local connections.

What it is to you or me is irrelevant. There are costs to a transaction which are already being heavily subsidised by inflation and goodwill of full nodes. If you want a spot, pay up. Undermining the security and resiliency of the currency so that the poor can use Bitcoin onchain will just destroy the currency.
By your analogy, ferraris and private jets are too expensive for most people, so should be made cheaper.

The fixed ceiling is a security parameter against centralisation, which is the defining attribute of Bitcoin and not a problem as you deem it to be. Attacking the heart of Bitcoin to attain something as irrelevant as doubling of transaction capacity is downright foolish.
Bitpay's adaptive blocksize is no different than an unlimited block size, since block sizes can be freely padded by miners. The fact that you even consider it viable, let alone endorse it, shows how unqualified you are to be involved in this matter.

There is a very high chance that customer funds were used to pump Ethereum in the first half of May, something which would have required hundreds of thousands of BTC without any other news driving the rally. 
It is no secret that Coinbase employees were buying ether hand over fist before the Coinbase Ether announcement. Unless Coinbase employees are all multi-millionaires who went all in into ether, there is no way that they could have pumped the price with their personal wealth alone.
Given the sudden price collapse of Ether during US nighttime and the illiquidity of the BTC/ETH  market, they could be holding millions of Eth bought with customer funds with no way out.
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:25:00
Hmm, isnt that a soft fork then.
If i boot up a v0.1 client today, the longest chain would still be valid, just that between those 2 points of time the blocks would have less than 4500 unique txns. So technically all the original rules are still valid today, just that any older clients at that point of time may have had a reorg as the network mysteriously(to the client atleast) chose another chain.
@_date: 2016-06-18 05:53:34
I said marketshare, not marketcap. As you mentioned, Litecoin has achieved that before.
To elaborate on my point, i think Ethereum is vastly overvalued (even now after the DAO event) for a token used solely as fuel for smart contracts, assuming it is not designed to be a SOV. As you mentioned, ethereum changes rapidly whereas Bitcoin has from day1 chosen to be as complete and conservative as possible, making it ideal as a SOV. A rapidly changing protocol presents many risks and uncertainty over it's future form and function, which is why it is ill-suited to be used as a SOV.
And i fully agree with you that vast majority of capital in Bitcoin could care less about the bells and whistles or even onchain scalability if it even in the slightest affects security/decentralisation of the coin. Gold has shit features and 0 upgrades since the Big Bang, yet it didn't prevent it from attaining and holding on to a multi-trillion $ market cap.

Have you read about Interleaved Mining? 
@_date: 2016-06-10 13:05:30
If im remembering it right, it has to do with the mutation of your initial refund txn.
Before committing to a channel, Alice will ask Bob to sign a full refund transaction. So before the multi-sig address is funded, a refund transaction is already produced. 
It is possible for Bob to then mutate his funding transaction to the channel and make the refund transaction he signed earlier invalid.

The economics is very simple and not really a point of contention.
Raise the blocksize =&gt; raise cost of running nodes &amp; increase miner centralisation BUT lower onchain fees
Both sides probably agree on this point, the issue is whether or not its worth to sacrifice decentralisation further for lower onchain fees.

Soft forks are by definition a subset of the original rules, so they do not in anyway violate what was valid before. Your full node is still validating transactions after the soft fork. What it cant do is enforce the new rules which are still within bounds of the original rules.
Regardless of whether or not soft forks are made official in releases, miners have always had and will always have the power to impose soft forks on their own by simply enforcing new rules which are within bounds of the original rules.

@_date: 2016-11-29 08:24:41
In a dynamic block system, full blocks would always increase the blocksize limit. 
Larger blocks push out smaller miners due to implicit selfish mining, ie. the time spent waiting to download and validate a big block is the time the miner is idle and not mining while the miner who found the block has a headstart.

Any hard fork whether by Core or anyone else is by definition not Bitcoin. Any incompatible consensus rule change is another coin. Whether people choose to adopt the hard fork is another matter, but it is technically not the Bitcoin which Satoshi left behind.




This line only demonstrates your ignorance on the matter. The entire point of a sound currency is to be immutable regardless what is in fashion or determined to be of importance by people.

A decentralised cryptocurrency is only as strong as the number of independent full nodes used for economic use. 
Given that Bitcoin full node counts are at all time lows, yes you should absolutely run a full node if you can. More importantly, you should rely on the full node to receive bitcoin, either directly via it's built in wallet or using a light client which connects to your full node for data.

Clearly at this moment, the answer is no.
So what makes you think this situation will change, particularly at the fixed 1mb level? (Since I take it you advocate mircea's 1mb limit.)
I don't know for sure, nobody does. But wouldn't raising the blocksize just make this  point that much harder to reach? 
Anyway, the prime concern is not that demand wont be enough to fill 1MB blocks and raise fees. Even with lightning, 1MB blocks will be easily filled if adoption continues at historical rates. the prime concern is how centralised the ecosystem will become with larger blocks. 
If you have to run a SPV node because full nodes require a server rack to run and trust that Bitcoin rules are being followed by blindly trusting 2-3 pools which control &gt;50% of hashing power, then you might as well use Ripple of Fiat, at least in those currencies there are publicly known institutions who can be sued and there is no proof of work overhead. As LukeJr put it, "if you dont run a full node, you aren't really using Bitcoin." You are just trusting someone else.


That is entirely subjective, depending on the situation and person, different things are desired.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:51:33


On Mike:
Mike is not even remotely in the same league as the core developers technically. But this is not important if his vision was sound, good developers would commit to XT. More importantly, his explicit support for centralization and censorship in the past is a great cause for concern. His vision for Bitcoin is for a few google sized corporations to run full nodes/Bitcoin.
On Gavin:
Gavin has explicitly stated in the past on the mailing lists that he does not understand the intricacies/concerns of mining/miners and neither is he concerned about security of the protocol. See for example, 
Because $4 billion of other peoples money is not an important consideration as long as bitcoin can scale to Visa levels.
On XT:
The core developers against large blocksize increase are not idiots, they have valid security concerns. Greg Maxwell and Pieter are extremely respected developers, much more so than Gavin when you look at their contributions. Adam Back invented HashCash, without which Bitcoin would not exist today.
Some of their concerns include
-Falling full nodes
Allows sybil attacks on SPV nodes, increases profitability of selfish mining.
-Encourage longer SPV mining
As the recent fork showed, Chinese miners were SPV mining while waiting for the latest block to download and validate. Just by browsing the blockchain, you can see that this can drag to above 1minute. This means that if someone intentionally/accidentally mined an invalid block, ~50% of the hashing power would blindly build on top of that for upto 1minute. At 8 MB, this could drag on for far more than 8 minutes...
The previous fork dragged on for 6 blocks. Anyone using SPV wallets to receive payments for irreversible goods/services in that time was literally screwed if double spending were to happen. The previous fork was accidental, the next one may be intentional with double spending.
-Centralizes node validation and mining
In a world where only miners are running full nodes, it becomes vulnerable to many forms of attacks, ie. block withholding by larger miners, etc.. So even if a miner has 20% of actual hashing, he mines 20 + X% of blocks via these attacks, causing smaller miners disproportionate losses and further incentivising mining centralization.
Im not sure i would want my money on a chain managed by either of these 2 incompetent developers.
 


There is no evidence that current bitcoin adoption is in anyway being hindered by 1MB blocks, infact the average blocksize today is not even 500KB.

Sure we do, subsidy drops. 


The bigger assumption is that global commerce will be happening with Bitcoin, and if it does, there is no reason why txn fees from global commerce will not be sufficient to secure the blockchain.


Then fees will drop as block space frees up and be competitive again. That is how any market works.

Yes, this is a problem. I just started up a new node on a 5 year old machine and its been taking forever to sync. The CPU bottleneck for signature validation is huge and will always be growing.
There are some security concerns with UTXO commits as well, but i havn't read up on the details.
IMO, checkpointing as it is in the current client where signature validation is skipped, but everything else is validated until the checkpoint is a more secure alternative.
@_date: 2015-08-21 12:40:33
Well put, many people do not realise how much time and effort has been put in by the devs to keep Bitcoin going and growing to where it is today.
Don't believe me? Download any client before v0.7 and try getting it to sync. Even with 1MB blocks, you probably will give up before it syncs. The older the client, the more your PC will struggle with syncing and keeping up with current transaction volumes.

While free markets are great, the bitcoin protocol is not a market good. 
Changes to the protocol result in Tragedy of Commons scenarios and more importantly affect decentralization which arguably is the prime trait of Bitcoin and why Bitcoin has survived till today and is the largest private currency in recent history.
The natural trend of any market is to centralize as an industry matures and more competent players either kill/bleed/acquire their competition. 
Centralization is great in terms of being more efficient, reducing redundancy and brings about cost savings to consumers.
The downsides of centralization are increased vulnerability to internal/external risks like government coercion, corruption, systemic risks to the entire industry, etc.. 
Bitcoin is purposefully inefficient, extremely redundant(thousands of nodes store the entire blockchain),   absolutely distrusting of other peers (every full node downloads from the genesis block and validates every transaction ever to be 100% certain to get current ledger state) and expensive(for onchain txns, which is subsidised by inflation today). But that is precisely why it is so valuable, it is trustless and not vulnerable to any authority manipulating the currency.
My first impression of Bitcoin was that this was the dumbest design for a payment system, it is designed to be several orders of magnitude more expensive than any existing payment system that we have today. Then after deeper pondering about the design choices, i realised that Bitcoin was concerned first and  foremost with being an incorruptible, trustless currency which is something no other currency other than gold can provide. These are the traits which gave Bitcoin it's value and which contribute to most of it's current valuation. If you wanted a cheap payment system, Ripple is a far better alternative.
The cost to transact will go down if computing/networking/storage for mainstream PCs continues to advance, but that is not set in stone. Moore's law is arguably already dead for a decade where single threaded performance has not made any significant advances since the Pentium 4 era (double at most in the past decade), network bandwidth growth may stall in the event of a major recession or even reverse in the event of war. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:08:41


If you think the money is going to go with a fork run by a couple of clowns who think decentralization is secondary to low fee txns, then you are sorely mistaken. People hold bitcoins not to spend it on coffee or online shopping, they hold it for it's anti-censorhip and decentralied properties. 
People who use bitcoins only for spending contribute very little to its market price.
Once you raise the blocksize beyond a certain threshold, it becomes inconceivable to run a full node to ensure the protocol is being followed without trusting a large miner or institution. And if you have to trust someone, you are better off using centralized currencies like fiat/ripple where there is no proof of work overhead. Nobody knows what that threshold is, but in general core-devs are being conservative while Mike and Gavin dont care about centralisation. Mike has also stated many times that he thinks it would be optimal for a handful of Google sized corporations to run full nodes while everyone else just uses SPVs and **trusts** them.

Just because you lack the knowledge and intellectual capacity to understand why it causes centralization, it does not mean that the opposite is true.
Do you even run a node?
Have you tried syncing a node from scratch? 
How many days did it take with &lt;1MB blocks?
How many months will it take with 8MB blocks?
How many pools do you need to coeerce/convince/buy to control &gt;50% of hashing power today?
Do you know what is selfish mining?
Do you understand how larger block sizes coupled with selfish mining allows larger miners to mine more % of blocks than their % of hashing power?
Do you understand how that invalidates 1 CPU 1 Vote paradigm that secures the network currently?

This is not true. Moore's law has already been dead for a decade now. While transistor counts have continued to grow, performance gains has been largely insignificant.
Performance increases per core has barely doubled in a decade. Initially, the path chosen was to increase the number of cores as performance per core reached its limits. But that too ran into problems with power consumption and memory bandwidth issues. This article was written in 2012, and it's explanations have stood the test of time. We are still stuck with quad cores after a decade. 
The trend in the industry seems to be moving to specialised processors for every task, sort of like a throw back to the old days where there was a add-in card for every function (ie sound cards,  I/O card, etc..). But if we have to buy secp256k1 cards to run a full node, then decentralization will be non-existent (I could see miners purchasing these to speed up validation to avoid mining on top of potentially invalid blocks). The other option is to do this validation on the GPU, but thus far efforts on this seem to suggest that the GPU is not very optimal for the task.
Regardless, its good to know that even people like you in the big blocks camp are thinking about these issues.

For it to be peer to peer, it has to be trustless first. If everone is forced to use insecure SPV/Coinbase and friends and trust a handful of miners to be honest, the currency becomes unreliable and untrustworthy and loses its value.

@_date: 2015-08-26 16:29:41


I think the core thing you are missing is that this is not at all about scaling to meet demand, whether it be actual or hypothetical. This is about supplying as much capacity as the technological constraints of a mainstream PC (to run a full node, with significant buffers to allow new nodes to catch up as well) allow in order to maintain decentralization. Demand will have to adjust to the constraints of reality(via various offchain solutions), not the other way around.
Assuming you agree with the above statement, then it is not possible to aim for X growth in Y years, because nobody knows how CPU/Bandwidth/Storage will scale for the average home PC.
So far only BIP100 has a human element of voting, which allows voters to to assess and determine these factors, unfortunately we only know of ways to let miners vote and miners do not have the average full node user in their interests.

If this whole debate on risks of XT is seriously about security risks, centralisation which you do not agree with, why not take the safer route and roll it out on a sidechain first. Show the world that it works and will not cause any issues, you will easily get consensus if that is indeed the case.

@_date: 2015-08-27 00:43:28


My counter to that would be that a centralised Bitcoin has very little value. Once only miners are able to run full nodes, they are literally sitting ducks for coercion, government manipulation, protocol manipulation. The economic majority would not care about Bitcoin if it became just another fiat currency.
It's really not hard to see full nodes continue declining as block size increases. Do not forget that unlike miners, full nodes have no financial incentives to run one. Everyone is either using SPV or a web wallet like coinbase. Nobody other than miners or a few big bitcoin businesses has any idea what the state of the ledger is. If Bitcoin became a $100 billion currency, these few businesses and miners have all the incentives to change the protocol. They could literally confiscate funds and move it to their control without the private key, inflate the money supply, etc..

You clearly contradict yourself.
* You **cannot** separate a protocol from the user experience of using that protocol.
First you say that UX and protocols cant be seperated. 
* Without extensions IMAP has no notion of **starring messages, search auto complete, etc ....** lots of features are missing.
Then you go on to say that gmail has all of these features which the email protocols do not support natively...
Its not as if Outlook, gmail, etc.. havn't added many additional features on top of plain old email. Your argument is akin to saying, TCP/IP is restricted to sending only 1's and 0's between nodes, there is no sound, video, information, chatting, mail, interactive gaming support, so the internet UX is significantly harmed by the inability to upgrade TCP/IP.
*  the GMail UX is significantly harmed by the inability to meaningfully upgrade the non POP/IMAP email protocols ...

This or Garzik's BIP100 are far more realistic in terms of maintaining decentralisation than any of the other proposals.
More than the specifics of the increase, its the abstract which is important.


Many people do not realise that Bitcoin's primary breakthrough(or the blockchain if you will) is **decentralized consensus** aka **trustlessness**. 
Its not about sending money faster or cheaper, that could be done for almost free on any centralized database or even a spreadsheet. And it will be done with layers ontop(centralized or decentralized) of Bitcoin if the core protocol survives by remaining decentralized.
The bulk of bitcoin's value comes from its **decentralized property**, which gives the user **full control** over their money, the knowledge that no individual or group can inflate away it's value, censor transactions for any reason or freeze/confiscate/steal it. This is why people choose to HODL bitcoins and give it it's value, not because sending bitcoins is cheap or fast...
**Without this decentralized property, bitcoin would be as worthless as Ripple, which is not trustless but has much cheaper and faster transactions.**
Ripple has already been forced to adopt AML/KYC measures, frozen users money because of its centralized nature. I dont think anyone wants Bitcoin to follow it's footsteps.

By spend do you mean inflation?
The thing that most people do not realise is that an attacker does not need to buy millions of dollars of mining equipment, they just need to pay miners more than what they earn per block to lure them into reorging a block.
Picture this:
I send 500 BTC to an exchange requiring 3 confirmations. Once the amount is credited in the exchange's database, i send a chain of 4 double spend transactions which are spending the input i sent to the exchange back to me, each with a fee of 30BTC.
Miners are going to see that there is 120 BTC on the table if they mine ontop of the block before my original transaction. This will require 51% mining power, but we just need 2-3 pools to do it today with 100% chance of success, or even 1 pool could with a lower chance of success if the reward was large enough such that EV is positive.
As an attacker i could even pay 100BTC in fees per txn, because if the attack succeeds, i make 100BTC profit. If miners don't bite, i dont lose anything.
Expect to see bounty attacks like this alot more as the subsidy drops and fees remain low.

Segwit is optional, companies don't have to implement support if they don't want to.


Seriously wtf? It is similar to any other softfork done in Bitcoin's history, it will be usable when miners support it.
Contrast that with a **controversial hardfork with a forced flag day**, which is pretty much a **dictatorship model forcing changes upon the ecosystem.** 


There is no block size problem, blocks are not full, fees are insufficient to pay for mining and most of the txns are economically de minimis spam.


There is some truth to this. What is being done for the Segwit SF could be dangerous if abused to implement controversial changes. Thankfully, Segwit is not controversial. However everyone should remain vigilant for any future changes implemented via this method.
Ofc, he totally ignores the fact that forcing a controversial HF with only 75% miner threshold is even worse which risks splitting the currency into 2.




**If changing the protocol is to be as simple as garnering majority hashpower, then Bitcoin has no value. Lets change the 21 million cap with a Hardfork to pay miners and pay Classic developers, 51% threshold.**

Actually CPU is a huge issue for new nodes.
Even with the 7x speedup in 0.12, people on consumer hardware require more than 24hrs to fully sync the chain, see
Bandwidth is a huge issue for miners, greatly amplified by the GFW. 
See all those empty blocks? It happens because miners were unable to download the full block to determine which txns to include in their new block, so they mine an empty block. Empty blocks have been observed even with 1 minute lapses between blocks, meaning a miner cannot even download and validate a new block in 1 minute.
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:38:52
Yes, raising of the block size is sacrificing bitcoin decentralization to subsidise transaction fees.  
What most people fail to realise is that the bulk of Bitcoin's value comes from it's decentralized qualities, not its transactional attributes. 
Dont believe me? Just look at gold. Its status as an element and immunity to the whims of politicians and bankers is what gives it it's multi-trillion market cap even though its hardly transacted with today.
If we keep raising block sizes beyond what is accessible for an average user, there will come a future when a handful of big corporations run the network(Mike Hearns wet dream) and will be able to trivially change the rules to extend block rewards and inflate the currency for their own benefit.

Banks are not the problem, the root problem are central banks screwing with money, requiring permission to participate, regulating and thereby enabling banks to profit unfairly off the system.
Increasing blocksize trends Bitcoin toward a central bank model which will compromise on permissionless, censorship properties. If only a few entities run nodes, miners will pretty much control Bitcoin because everyone will be on SPV and trust hashpower alone or worse, on Coinbase like companies. There will be no one to stop miners from inflating the currency or stealing/freezing money, because SPVs have no clue.
It is better to have a decentralised Bitcoin, even if the average consumer has to transact through intermediaries, the advantage being that nobody can screw with the currency or require permissions to participate as an intermediary because there is no central party preventing you from using the blockchain.
Fortunately, with LN, we can have everyone transacting P2P without having to keep money with intermediaries.

I actually think if LN does take off, 6 months is too conservative.
 Assuming all retail level payments in the economy are done via LN (and why not, it is cheaper/instant), you will receive your salary and spend entirely via LN. The only time you will do a onchain txn is when you open a channel, close a channel. This is almost synonymous with opening and closing a bank account with some differences in the following scenarios.
* Moving money to savings, you will probably close your channel and move the savings to cold storage. But then again, why would you do that when you could run a node and earn a return on your savings?
* Channels that you have are unable to route to a payee, so you will need to open a new channel and close an existing one as well if you dont have any free funds.
* The channels that you have do not have sufficient capital to route your payment, so u have to establish new channels.
Note that for ii &amp; iii, it is entirely possible if LN reaches a certain level of saturation and connectivity that it will never happen. Just like how your ISP today does not have lines to every other ISP in the world. It should be possible to use funds in a receiving channel to route to any payee.
Also further advances in the protocol to allow split channel payments would greatly improve the flexibility and range on whom you can pay.

The problem is that the free market tends to centralise over time, because like you said, survival of the fittest and also because centralised solutions are always more efficient. 
That is something that is contrary to Bitcoin's core value. Bitcoin was purposely designed with an inefficient scheme(mining POW, storing entire history forever, every node needing to know and validate everything) to enable decentralisation. And that is why at the end of the day it will never be an equal competitor(wrt cost of onchain txns) to any centralised payment solution.
The design of Bitcoin mining is to enable anyone with any amount of hashing power to get their respective share of block rewards/fees. It doesnt matter if you are google or some guy in his basement, if you hash 10% of network, you get ~10% of rewards. If you have 0.001% of hashing equipment, you should get 0.001% of rewards.
 Once non-hashing costs become non-trivial, the design no longer holds true and starts to favour larger miners with 1 full node serving thousands of ASICS, 1 Gigabit connection serving thousands of ASICS and encourages mining centralisation.

Actually its is fully decentralised. In essence ln is just clever usage of  multi-sig txns to prevent dbl spending after anchor txns. Infact it is likely going to be far more decentralised then onchain txns if u consider that pretty much anyone can be a ln node vs a mining pool 
@_date: 2016-10-23 11:38:10
I would argue 1MB was already far too large. I see people stop running full nodes because they do not have 100GB to spare on their hard disks or because sync takes days. 
Your argument is to me atleast, flawed because it assumes that adoption is being hindered by sub-dollar fees. Perhaps in terms of raw numbers, it may very well be hindered, but in my opinion, these free-loaders are the very type of people we would be better off without.

Miners is not 1 uniform group of people. Larger blocks kill smaller miners by depriving them of fee income. This causes further centralization resulting in a handful of large miners running the network.

This is one of the worst proposals. It basically amounts to infinite blocksize. Taking the median blocksize means that all miners have to do is keep creating max block sizes, ensuring that the median is always rising.
Any miner who wants vote a smaller blocksize is effectively going to go broke as he has to create smaller blocks and and miss out on fee income vs competitors.

If that were the case litecoin would be of much higher value than bitcoin and ethereum with no limit blocksizes would be king.
Favoring low fees in exchange for decentralisation is poor man's thinking and that is exactly the profile of the typical big blockist. Which is why their opinion matters little. Bitcoin is not a democracy, it is capitalistic in the purest sense. Coin holders will decide which chain thrives, and anyone rich enough cares more on the immutability of the rules than fees.

There will be no destruction of Bitcoin if block size does not get increased. All that will happen is that fees will go up some and the least economically significant txns will be pushed to offchain or to altcoins. Given their economic insignificance, the effect on Bitcoin will be insignificant.
Someone recently did some blockchain analysis and found 40% of current blockchain txns are very low value (&lt;$1).

Miners mining an unprofitable chain (cos of lower market value), will go out of business. In all eventuality, miners/exchanges/nodes can only influence the uninformed/ignorant, but ultimately the fork which wins will be the one whose coins are valued more, which is ultimately decided by the market.
As to why i think XT coins will be worth far less, both the developers have clearly shown that they do not value security or decentralisation, 2 of the primary attributes which give Bitcoin its value.

This nonsense will not end until they actually fork off and see it fail, which can be a long time.

While the price may appear to be keeping up, it is illusory, the big players have already cashed out, which is evident in the trading volume crash from its peak of 100k BTC to 5kish today. There is simply no liquidity for any large eth holder to liquidate without crashing the price.
And Bitcoin Unlimited is so flawed on all levels that it will be attacked the moment it is forked. The only real chance they had was with Classic, which thankfully failed.

Do you even run a node? Try running a fresh one and see how your machine struggles to sync up over 3-5 days. At 20mb blocks, it would become literally impossible for any new nodes to sync up with mainstream hardware, the verification of signatures is a huge bottleneck for syncing. 
Bandwidth wise, many existing nodes run at home would simply go offline as their internet became unusable for anything else. You dont just upload 20mb every 10 minutes. If you have the minimal 8  peers then you upload 20 X 8peers X 2 = 320Mb every 10 minutes.  
Most cable connections cannot support that type of upstream bandwidth.
And if you are trying to actually help the network and connect to 50 peers, well its not a feasible number for most household connections. 
Also while disk space is cheap, it is not free, especially when you are not getting paid to run a full node. Most people are not going to buy 1TB hard disks every year just to store the blockchain.
With 1000 nodes, its easy to ddos them. Even with 5000 nodes, it is easy for determined large governments to track down the nodes physical location via ip addresses and shut them down. The only hinderance they will face is that nodes are geographically well distributed today and it would be a real pain to bring them down in various jurisdictions. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:10:34
The flaw is with your expectations, not the protocol. Variance is an unavoidable aspect of decentralised POW blockchain-based currencies. 
At the end of the day, if your txn needs a fast confirmation, you can either pay more fees than average or use RBF to bump it up when you realise that the backlog is high and your txn is not going to be confirmed in time. With CPFP, it becomes even easier, simply spend the unconfirmed output with higher fees.
@_date: 2016-05-17 06:19:47
There is no inflation. You use Bitcoins by moving them to the RSK sidechain. And you can always move them back to the Bitcoin blockchain at the same rate, so there is no speculative risk. The exchange rates between the chains are pegged.

My point is that the attacker would not even be able to afford the attack if the relay fees were higher by default. 2.5 cents is insignificant for someone sending a transaction, but it quickly becomes **$25k** to spam the 1Gb of txns currently in the network.

It depends on what the sidechain is trying to do.
In the case of Liquid, consensus is not dependant on the bitcoin blockchain. But the assets that are being traded are Bitcoins themselves, hence they have a reliance on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain and multi-sig wallet secures the capital and ensures that it is spent according to the rules of the sidechain. This is great for Bitcoin because it increases the use-cases of Bitcoin.
If Liquid were for trading of non-blockchain assets like USD/houses/etc.., then there would be no requirement to depend on the bitcoin network and it could be used as a private blockchain. But offchain assets do not offer the same security guarantees since you require a trustee (3rd party clearinghouse/bank/etc..) to hold the off-chain assets.

Larger blocks just subidises this spam behaviour and imposes the spam on the blockchain by ensuring that they will confirm.
Why would the node operators be constantly raising or lowering the minfee settings? This whole mess would never have happened with older versions of bitcoin where the min relay fees were higher. They never needed to be changed in the first place.
The only reason the attacks are feasible is because minrelayfees are too low which makes the attack cheap.

@_date: 2015-10-13 11:06:11
Few differences
* The value in the sidechain is backed by Bitcoin which is decentralised. You do not have to worry about the value being inflated away.
* Every party is still a full node in the sidechain, so they have all records and blocks showing who signed what. In the event that someone behaves dishonestly, there is undisputable evidence on who misbehaved. 
* Perhaps most importantly, no party can steal the collateral (the BTC in the multi-sig wallet) than he is entitled to, because control over the BTC is decided by the sidechain (ie majority of participants following the rules of Liquid). There is no trust fund/bank holding the money for this arrangement, its all algorithmic. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:12:31
Blocks are not full for any extended periods of time. All my txns have been confirmed within an hour and i dont even pay more than 30 sat/byte. 
1mb blocks have been shown to take 30s to propagate across the network, making mining impossible for smaller miners who do not have a direct fast connection with the bigger miners. Bigger miners are not affected and infact profit more from this as they get a 30s headstart over their competitors every time they find a block. This causes centralisation of mining with a few large entities mining.
Also spare the bullshit about fiber internet. 1gbps local bandwidth is irrelevant when the bandwidth to china chugs at 50kbps thanks to GFW.
Also, high fees are good as they reduce spam and wasteful txns. U wldnt pay wire charges for a coffee, that doesnt mean that swift is a failed network. Rather it pretty much is the backbone of payments for the global economy.

The important distinction is that all these schemes are still dependant on the Bitcoin POW blockchain for one reason or another.
Liquid is only usable in a private setting where the parties are known and it is assumed that a majority are honest. You cannot assume this with a global currency.
Lightning depends on the Bitcoin blockchain for enforcement of the the contracts and final settlement, as well as the value(BTC) being transfered. It is simply a caching layer, something like a buffering system which coalesces multiple txns before posting a nett txn to the blockchain. You cannot have LN without the Bitcoin blockchain.

After the chain is synced, Bitcoin Core does not take up much CPU. RAM wise it will range from 1GB to 2GB, which can usually be reduced greatly by restarting the process once a month(assuming you leave it running 24/7).
CPU, Bandwidth and RAM will be greatly affected by the number of incoming connections you allow. As each connection means you will relay transactions and blocks to them.
You can also enable pruning to only keep the recent XGB of the blockchain if hard disk space is a concern.

My guess is that since the only users of the sidechain will be the participating exchanges, there is no need for POW since this is a private sidechain where all parties are known. 
This has a few advantages,
* Since all parties are known, double spending can be prevented by creating blocks in a round robin format, which is probably hardcoded into the sidechain protocol.
* Without POW, you no longer need a 10min block interval, you simply take turns in a round robin to create blocks. So txns are pretty close to instant.
* Without POW, running the chain is almost free since there is no mining. Chain size is also likely to be tiny considering there are only 5 users at the moment.
* Security is still maintained. ie. None of the exchanges can use more money than they have since the sidechain keeps track of balances.
* There is no exchange rate risk since sidechain tokens are pegged to Bitcoin's value.
* Use of confidential txns ensures noone other than the 2 exchanges in the txn know of what is going on.
In short, hashing power is replaced with the signed approval of the participating exchanges. 
Collateral Capital is the BTC deposited to the multi-sig wallet which is controlled by the sidechain.
The only risk i can see is that 3 out of the 5 exchanges must remain honest (ie not changing their node rules) to prevent theft of funds.
Edit : As to why this is a big deal, it replaces the function of a trustee (usually bank/financial inst./trusted intermediary) with an algorithm which in this case is the Liquid protocol. While this is of little use to average people directly, it shows a glimpse of what is possible with sidechains. The amount of innovation possible is very very great with all value in the chain backed by actual Bitcoins.

Your logic is extremely poor. At 10KB blocks, you could easily support all the banks on the planet settling once a day amongst themselves, not 3. The current 1MB could easily support more Bitcoin banks than there are banks in the fiat world. 
What is important is that you do not need to store the bulk of your money with the banks, only a small amount for day to day transactions. The failure of any 1 bank does not screw everyone else who did their due dilligence. No bailouts, inflation. 
Enter LN, and you dont even have to keep funds with anyone else, everyone has control over their money and are able to transact instantly and cheaply once you establish your channels.

Accepting unconfirmed txns is not a feature of Bitcoin, it is a feature of idiots or people with too much money to lose.

This is well written and explains why larger blocks cause centralisation.

Bitcoin is not here to emulate the current financial system. That is totally backward.
The system should not be compromised with inferior or flawed methods just so that the UX transition is smoother for the user. The whole approach you have always advocated is to put UX first, over everything else, including security and sustainability of the protocol and network. That is like saying lets use 4 byte private keys because they are easy to remember like passwords. What you often fail to see is that in compromising for UX, the system becomes insecure or unviable. I don't expect the average XT supporter to understand the technicalities, but for someone of your aptitude, its seems as if your emotional hope overrides logic.
Off the top of my head, these are the things you have proposed:
* Lets have large block sizes and insist on every txn being on the blockchain, never mind about decentralisation. Handful of Google sized companies running full nodes is plenty decentralised.
* Lets have large block sizes to keep fees low to free, nevermind about about paying miners for the hashrate, some tooth fairy will appear to continually pay for assurance contracts and subsidise the security. In all probability, this will lead to changing the 21 million coin limit, so that inflation can pay for the security of the network.
* Lets have centralised blacklists to prevent *bad actors* from using the network. 
* Lets **force** SPV servicing on all full nodes, never mind the fact that it presents a potential DOS window and that the full node operator may not wish to have his hardware stalling from servicing SPV nodes.
* Lets bring down minimum fees by an order of magnitude, ignoring DOS attack warnings by Peter Todd because it is **unlikely**, which has led to the current mempool clogging and the DOS of a thousand nodes.

Actually i think this stress test is good in the long run, it shows us what a stupid decision it was to reduce minrelaytxfees to its current level, allowing cheap DOS attacks.
The outcome will be that most node operators will learn about the option and start using it, allowing full node operators to influence what minimum fee should be for relaying in a decentralised fashion. Untill now, full node operators have had little to no influence on most issues regarding the network.

Nakamoto consensus or Bitcoin only works as long as the presumption that there is open competition between miners. 
Today if the 2-3 largest pools colluded and started purposefully orphaning blocks of other miners, the other miners will go out of business regardless of their hashrate. In short it becomes impossible to mine unless you have the permission of the 2 largest pools.

Hey sure man, u stick to your wishful fantasies of insured banks which will never freeze or confiscate your funds and will be bailed out if something goes wrong. 
Meanwhile us paranoid people will take some responsibility to secure our own wealth.

Newer versions of core let you abandon an unconfirmed txn to resend it again

The problem is not with Bitcoin but you. Your entire post is basically complaining that you are too cheap or poor to pay for a service that you cant afford.
@_date: 2016-07-25 01:18:06
Lol, writing a wrapper over a bitcoin library is not called writing a node.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:20:48
What level of stupid are you?
