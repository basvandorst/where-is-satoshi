I...don't get it

Problem with that is the people with the mining hardware decide the information, not the people who actually know the information.

Ah. Thanks

Captcha hack?

Am I missing a joke here or something...? Why is this on r/Bitcoin. [Serious]

:3 I don't have a debit card. Do prepaid gift cards or PayPal work there?

Lock in a escrow?

So far

I am in the USA, so I might do that.

I have a *savings* account, but I'd perfer to not use it for this. (It would also require me talking to my dad, who just left for a business trip)
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:06:48
Also, can I transfer my bitcoin to Coinbase from my own wallet (blockchain.info)?
