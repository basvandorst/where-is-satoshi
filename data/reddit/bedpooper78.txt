That really doesn't answer the question.

Why do you refuse to use the search? There are at least 300 topics about this. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:09:54
How do you know it's undervalued?
Edit: the downvoting in this sub is just ridiculous. Really fucking ridiculous.

And Jehovas give an alternative to atheism. 
The sooner you understand that not everybody on this planet cares about Bitcoin the better you will understand the trolls. 
And i don't post on Buttcoin.

Obama can say all he wants but he doesn't make the decisions. Also i don't see how this is directly relevant to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:11:36
No, not really. 99% of these new users only used the tipping system so far. Wait till they start buying and storing coins.

Funny, i was just thinking about you. The op is quickly turning into one of the biggest delusional cultists in this sub. He might be after your crown. Did you notice this as well? Are you worried?
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:37:54
You are seriously wondering why? No, i don't believe it. Even the biggest cultist here can't be that far into fantasy land. 
Let me know if you need one of the probably 100 reasons i can find.

Those 2 posts were from a Bitcoiner using fake nicks. Can't remember the username but he's tipping himself 13 dollars on those nicks. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:25:18
No.

This graph had been posted about 150 times here. At every possible price Bitcoin has been and every time someone tells you "we are here now".
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:17:17
Maybe because Bitcoiners are all over the place spreading their gospel?
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:40:39
"Little bit"
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:51:17
Uh what?
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:41:21
Tons and tons of people. Millions. 
Just look at this sub. There are so many people who just post here pumping Bitcoin all day long. 
Is this their paid gig or just random people with too much time? Too much time obviously. Just like the tons of Bitcoin haters out there. 
This sub really should stop acting like all these people are paid shills. It's ridiculous.

Who told you it was undervalued? A cannabiscoin owner by any chance?
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:59:00
Experts. What kind of experts?
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:02:27
Sure kiddo. It's banks and governments.
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:11:16
With killing him you mean giving someone the money he asked for his coins?
Edit: downvoted because?
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:01:12
Of course i trust you. Your arguments and logic are flawless. Selling my house now!
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:31:05
Oh right. Well in that case it must be true. Awesome logic. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:38:53
Funny how you say the same thing as i do yet ypu are on top with upvotes and i'm at the bottom downvoted to hell.
