Have I been the only guy who has been served well (albeit super late) by BFL? They've shipped 2 generations of miners to me now (FPGA and ASIC) and I ordered long enough ahead of time both times to be profitable.
This is a brand new industry and there are risks there. If you didn't get in early you're just whining. BFL was doing completely new things and that is always extremely difficult. They had no way to predict future mining difficulty nor any problems they would encounter.
Maybe I have a higher tolerance for this because I'm a developer and am intimately familiar with unexpected engineering problems, or because I've worked at startups for 10 years now.

Reddit, you're better than this.
Bitcoin has a software-imposed limit of around 7 transactions per second. Higher levels are, at best, untested, even if allowed via software.
VisaNet handled **11,000 TPS** during Black Friday.
That's... let's see... at least *3 orders of magnitude* higher.
I'm a HUGE Bitcoin fan, but I wouldn't fool myself... This is not a trivial problem, folks. In my 20 years of experience as a programmer in the technology space, I've noticed that achieving a new order of magnitude in any system almost always requires a new idea/technology to make it happen.

1) At least two bitcoin ETF's will launch this year. Based on how gold ETF's affected the price of gold, there is reason to be optimistic. (This knowledge may or may not already be "built in" to the price, but I know that a lot of nontechnical people like my finance brother-in-law, who has both funds listed on his Bloomberg terminal, won't dip in until that hits.)
2) Most of the "cellphoned 3rd world," where bitcoin could arguably have its largest impact, has barely been scratched yet.

If they allowed a bitcoin wallet app then they would have to allow a game that, for example, used bitcoin for IAP, circumventing Apple's entire business model (which is to take a 30% cut). Since they can't take a 30% cut of a Bitcoin transaction (lol), in order to do it legitimately, they'd have to control the receiving Bitcoin addresses (I think Coinbase is one of the only sites left which does that and hasn't been hacked), and they just don't want to get their hands dirty with that business... Yet.
That's the best explanation I've read, anyway

I understand your criticism and see through your wholly unnecessary venom, but
1) Show me a decentralized bitcoin integration with common point-of-sale systems which will exchange for fiat at will. (I'm sorry, but you're not going to get enough people willing to deal in pure bitcoin and take on that risk, because most people are pussies. This is aside from the fact that there needs to be software to relate bitcoin payments to products sold, tally bills, etc.)
2) Software development is hard. Open source relies literally on people giving their (meager) free time. You can bypass this and speed it up by paying people for the majority of their time. This is otherwise known as "employment." Employment, at this time (maybe not forever), requires centralization. And thus, we have centralized entities like Bitpay and Coinbase who are *working to expand the reach of Bitcoin*. Maybe in the future we will have decentralized companies (that would be awesome). But we're not quite there yet.
Your loud (if possibly justified) criticism is hampered by 2 things: 1) You don't have a better idea. 2) Too venomous.
I do think you're getting too many downvotes, so I'm stepping up. I also have a soft spot for people who say the difficult things without giving a shit about karma, and for purists/idealists. Your message is getting lost in all the anger, though.

How is this "advertising a competing product"? Bitcoin is not a product, it is a protocol, and zero advertising dollars were spent. There is nothing capitalist about it.

I'm a programmer and you my friend are full of it.
Supporting old hardware with new software is *hard.* You have to write more code, test more code, QA more scenarios. More support calls to deal with more bugs. It gets expensive in time and money. It has absolutely NOTHING to do with "forcing people to pay to upgrade" (except as a slight side benefit). And some things start to just be no longer possible to do. The guy who wrote that newer game that requires iOS 5 does it because 5 actually has a fucking garbage collector (to automatically clean up unused memory) and if he didn't rely on that labor saving device he'd basically have to rewrite his whole app code. And in turn, iOS 5 might require a certain level of hardware because it's just growing in size due to the new features it has to support and the older phones are too slow or don't have enough memory or maybe don't have a powerful enough graphics chip to support the new effects.
Let's take an example- Android phones. Except in rare cases as I understand it, you can't even UPGRADE the Android OS on your phone without buying a new phone AT ALL unless it is a Nexus device from Google.

Anyway keep kicking ass. And as I recommended before, just please make sure you have adequate unit test coverage- as a guy who's done software for 20 years now, I cannot emphasize that enough. At some point you might also want to bring on a security consultant to spend an hour or 2 giving your code a look-see because the intersection between web-based (in)security and an app that deals with *money* is going to create a rather attractive attack surface.

There seems to be a strong economic incentive to mine at GHash.io considering they do **altcoin merged mining.**
Basically, that's like mining multiple cryptos at once (which use the same POW algorithm) with the same amount of work.
That doesn't seem to be getting the attention it deserves. That is a HUGE deal with many implications.

It's my opinion that most of the hype behind NoSQL is driven by new young people who are too lazy to understand relational database principles, which in my opinion serve real purposes. :) But even with a NoSQL scheme, you need a way to distribute potentially hundreds of new records a second across such a network in a synchronous way.

1) Visit bitaddress.org, preferably on an OS install you know is secure. If really paranoid, save site to offline HTML page on a fresh OS install, disconnect internet, and open offline saved HTML page.
2) create a sheet (or 10) of BIP0038 encrypted paper wallets
3) DO NOT forget the password you use
4) Print as a PDF and store it both locally and in the cloud
5) Go to blockchain.info/wallet, add "watch only" address, add the public addresses from the above PDF, set it to notify you if the balance changes.
6) Send bitcoins to those public addresses for storage. You should get a notification.
To spend coins:
1) Import wallet into blockchain.info/wallet. Paste BIP0038 encrypted private key. Enter password. Wait a few seconds. Done, you now have access to the coins.
Do the above steps with small amounts of coin and practice addresses first so you understand the workflow. The nice thing about this is that you don't need to worry about secure physical storage of your paper wallet private keys as BIP0038 is highly brute-force-attack-resistant.
I have successfully used the above workflow to manage a large number of bitcoins with 100% success and no loss of coin
I just wish bitaddress.org looked a little snazzier, considering how awesome and useful it is. The paper wallets it makes are NICE, though.

Ripple *the idea* was neat. Like an IOU system based on a network of trust.
Ripple *the implementation* is a load of bullshit (until I am convinced otherwise). First mistake was not open-sourcing from the get-go. Second mistake was 10 people owning/controlling 95% of the XRP. Third mistake was a completely homegrown and completely confusing "consensus algorithm" that does not seem to be based on any other known (and proven) consensus algorithms like PAXOS. I swear to Christ, if you prove to me that you *fully* understand it, and can explain it to me, I will pay you 0.5 Bitcoin. I have been coding for years now and I can't grok it. I seriously think it's "consensus via obfuscation" which means it's only a matter of time before an exploit is found.

Who is regulating the flow of physical dollars, which is, *far and away,* the  facilitator of crime?
Your post seems like a very calculated troll to create a reaction.
There is no such thing as "good" regulation. Decentralized technologies see regulation as "damage" and route around it.
If you are serious, consider this: If it were possible to prevent ANY and ALL bad actors from acting badly, would you be in favor of that? Note that it would HAVE to severely inconvenience ALL good actors to find the bad ones. (You cannot have more security without more inconvenience.)

I agree with this.


I will say two things here: 1) I don't agree with the way this is worded, BUT 2) a libertarian recently described "arrest and imprisonment" to me as "kidnapping and caging" and that gave me pause and made me think. It made me think a lot, actually, and I was suddenly shocked at how simply rephrasing something with different words can kind of kick you in the gut. Words are dangerous.


This is, unfortunately, *the work you have to do when you are trying to convince someone of something or convey a novel idea.* That sort of conversation is necessary if the conversation is "real" and you want to change minds. Most people are willing to change their mind... but not without a fight. Worldviews might as well be concrete... Which means you just kind of have to chip away at it over time. I know because I am a masochist who enjoys doing this (for other topics). And I'm convinced that I HAVE changed minds. The catch is- your mind might get changed, too. It's a rewarding process for me.
Look at the very structure of my response here, it was consciously designed to communicate better with you: First, I agreed with 2 of your points (establishes credibility). Then I debated a point (while giving an additional avenue of agreement). And at the end I disagreed (somewhat) with a point, and then tried to explain why.

Of course, don't ever say the R word (rape) even if discussing it academically. The entire room will go silent and glare at you. And there's a fucking health food store on every block. And the taxes are high, for all that social support. Etc

It's becoming kind of like a relationship where all the trust is lost.
We all know how those relationships end up.
It's like the difference between having a pretty good feeling your SO won't betray you, and having access to all their communications and tailing them with a private investigator.
There is something lost there, and I believe a related kind of relationship exists between the people and their government.
It's something having to do with being a control freak.
There MUST be a certain level of trust between a government and its people.

I can't find who said this but I quote: "The Internet sees regulation as 'damage' and routes around it." This is true of ALL decentralized technologies. Essentially, you can't secure a border with a million possible points of entry (and easy ways to cryptographically hide if that number is somehow limited).
Remember when Internet commerce was limited by geocentric state tax law? Well, the Internet doesn't care where you are on the planet *and that is how it should be.*
Regulators are missing the big picture. An entirely separate culture is being built right now which is not tied to any country and which only exists online. Bitcoin is a part of that story.
Bitcoin is not meant for those in power. Bitcoin is meant for the little people. Bitcoin is freedom.
EDIT: [FOUND IT!]( "but as Internet pioneer John Gilmore puts it, 'The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.'" Regulation is very similar to censorship, it's a large speed bump instead of a gate, and people like to go fast...

Right now, nobody can prove I own a bitcoin address unless I prove it to them by signing something with my private key.
Right now, I can run Bitcoin over any port, tunnel it over an encrypted connection, etc.
Right now, once a Bitcoin transaction goes out into the network, nothing known can stop it.
Right now, nobody can confiscate my bitcoins (assuming they even know I possess them, see point 1) without holding a gun to my head or some other threat.
So please tell me again, how you can regulate Bitcoin, assuming you don't go through an exchange (which is obviously regulatable, at least right now)? Because right now, as it stands, you can't even trace who is doing what with it. So there is no possible determination of "who doesn't follow them."
There's a tipping point, not very far away from where we are now actually, where entire supply chains could theoretically transact using only Bitcoin (or a combination of cryptos). What then? What happens when I DON'T actually have to trade bitcoins for "cash" anymore to conduct most of my business? What if this happens gradually, over time (like right now)?
Just like a cash business that never deposits into the bank... except that cash businesses have brick and mortar components which the IRS/DHS/FBI can barge in on, spy on, detect a discrepancy with. "His IRS returns do not reflect his standard of living. He must be conducting business off our radar."
The future economies will be idea-based. Ideas are just information. Information is digital. Bitcoin is digital. What then?
Barge in on a centralized location? Well, decentralized technologies are on the rise, and there will always be a government somewhere on the planet who will just host a webserver and look the other way, for the right price.

Wealth inequality is not going to go away. What is bad is when it becomes too difficult to get from low to high. We need to keep that as fluid as possible.
The problem is that it takes real risk to make real profit. And hindsight is 20/20... There were dozens of places along the path here where Bitcoin could have failed (and there are still plenty of threats).
If you want to make real money, save a pile of cash and invest in startup ideas somehow. Or work for one yourself.
I get a little miffed when people get angry at wealth inequality since it is often the wealthy who took big risks at some point. So stop being risk-averse like everyone else and "wing it" for a change! Don't you realize that "The Man" is paying you just enough to keep you sedated and no more?
I'll disclaimer by being totally honest and tell you my story- I got involved in startups years ago after realizing that working for "great big secure corporations" made me nauseous. I'm a programmer with ideas and passions and they were going to waste... I got into Bitcoin almost exactly 2 years ago after I realized it didn't die after the big MtGox hack of 2011 (and after my girlfriend made me watch The Good Wife with her, which had an entire episode about it *two years ago*). The more I read about it the more excited I got (I'm a programmer, so the fact that it was open-source and that I could read the code didn't hurt!) The problem is, 2 years ago I was "in between jobs" i.e. unemployed. I had lost my job because unbeknownst to me I was suffering from really bad sleep apnea at the time (it was just starting to get treated). But something in my gut said I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS NEW SHINY THING. So I did the most ludicrous (to other people) thing possible- I cashed out 2 of my meager 5 401k's to fund the preorder of 2 FPGA mining rigs from an unknown company called BFL. Before I continue, let's review all the risks I took on here at once:  
1) BFL was completely unproven at the time. (I finally trusted them after MANY email exchanges.)  
2) I found out later that BFL's CEO was an ex-white-collar-con. It took all my energy to not cancel my preorder.  
3) BFL took nearly a year to deliver their product. I never canceled my preorder (this was a risk) and they eventually shipped and the miners worked well.  
4) Bitcoin was still extremely wet behind the ears and was mainly only used for illicit transactions at the time. (But I knew that technologies are amoral, and as a technology, Bitcoin struck me as completely unique/new!)  
5) I was not only unemployed but *risked my future security* by cashing out those 401k's. I also paid a penalty for cashing them out early. (I also endured A LOT of flack from my parents.)
In short, I "wung it". And yeah, now I'm sitting on a pile of virtual cash, as it were. I am entirely convinced that I earned it, though, and I hope you are too.
You know that hindsight I mentioned? In hindsight, had I just bought the coins outright instead of preordering mining rigs, I'd be sitting on five times the number of bitcoins now. Ah well. I can kick myself for not having done that, or I can realize that I did OK and move on to the next risks in life...
Not every 1 percenter is a trust fund kid. Some actually have balls. So stop bitching and grow some and do or make something the world will pay you real money for.

The identifier is SUPPOSED to be "ugly." It's random data by design. For example, if you, say, created a shortener or lookup service (like DNS which converts pretty "yahoo.com" to ugly 192.168.12.34), then someone could hack that shortener site and boom, problems.

I mean, books could be written about the ramifications of a cashless, anonymity-free society. For starters, imagine that every sexual encounter that involved an exchange of SOMEthing (even so much as a dinner) was traceable by anyone... or anyone with a certain level of access. You'd easily have a lot of people "by the balls", so to speak, in that scenario. Now imagine that information got hacked, and leaked. Leaking everyone's "indiscretions" at once could destroy society as we know it by holding all of us up against our own collectively high standards (which I suspect we fall far short of, in private). But hey... At least there would be less hypocrisy.
In any event, the more the government, or 3rd parties, try to eradicate *or obviate* the use of physical cash in favor of a technology that logs all transactions somewhere and affects a credit rating (see: Square, Apple Pay, etc.), the better Bitcoin will do, as people need to exercise discretion outside the rules sometimes, because at any given time, either the rules, or people, or both, are "imperfect."

How does the image make Bitcoin look ridiculous? You can in fact send any number of Bitcoins, anywhere, nearly instantly, for nearly free,  anywhere in the world, without any bank intervening, only using the Internet and bare-minimally a smartphone that can text-message. Anyone, without credit (see: enterprising kids, third-world nations, etc.), can buy and sell things on the Internet, using decentralized digital cash.
How is that not awesome?
Trading for the local fiat? A day may come, sir, when that may look like the "ridiculous" part.

 is not an argument. Do you wish to actually discuss things, or just troll?


We'll see about that.


Hey numbskull, that's simple economics 101. The price is higher because the demand is the same but the supply is lower (it's simply harder to get). If anything, that much higher of a price is indicative of the demand. You could bring Bitcoin into the country undetected, trade them for ARS, then trade those for USD (TBH, that might be the difficult step), and make a tidy profit. Theoretically.


Oh, by the way, which ARS&lt;-&gt;USD exchange rate were you referring to, the "black market" (aka "real" or "street") exchange rate, or the state-sanctioned bullshit exchange rate?
If you were such a fucking genius, you would have mentioned that detail and made that clear.


They can buy them at 832USD equivalent. *That doesn't mean they can't buy them.* The only reason why there exists that market price difference is because the *markets are artificially separated!* This is exactly the kind of thing that BTC is trying to destroy. As it should. If you don't like that price difference, *you should actually be a cryptocurrency fan* because, long term, it could destroy those dumb controls. Because fuck em, they are bullshit.
The days are already numbered for artificially-shored-up state currencies.

Of course they start in Australia, possibly the least libertarian bastion of the Western world.
And of course they appeal to FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt).

And of course they use easily refuted logic hiding in plain sight, as all their arguments work against plain old cash too. All in favor of banning fiat cash, say aye!
I found this because I was trying to submit the same link, with the same "and then they fight you" quote...
Actually, I just realized something. If the government ever DID wish to corral people's money exchange away from cash (and into more control), allowing limited counterfeitability would be one way of doing so. Can't counterfeit a Citibank bank balance or a credit card debt!

I'm thinking things like going from 1 database server to 10 database servers to 100 database servers.
Going from 10 to 100 customers is, you're right, not a good example. BUT if you were at first handling those 10 customers a day manually and were already "at capacity," then you're going to have to make serious changes to handle 100 customers a day manually.

Bullshit. Google 2FA &gt; Authy and I'll explain why:
1) First of all, that is the whole point of printing out one-time-use backup codes. Google walks you through it when you set up 2FA. Just store those securely in the cloud somewhere.
2) The Google 2FA algorithm is *open source*. None of this "security via obscurity" bullshit.
3) Google 2FA, since it is open-source and anyone can implement it, is decentralized. You know what *else* is open source and decentralized? Mmmhmm.
4) Did I mention that Authy is *centralized.* You have to *trust* them. *Fuck that.*
Authy has a nice UI, and I actually use them for Coinbase, but jeez. Stop spreading BS.

Apologies for reposting this here and hijacking your comment because I believe this is the problem:
There seems to be a strong economic incentive to mine at GHash.io considering they do **altcoin merged mining.**
Basically, that's like mining multiple cryptos at once (which use the same POW algorithm) with the same amount of work. And as we can see at the crypto charts, that can be very profitable.
That doesn't seem to be getting the attention it deserves. That one feature is a HUGE deal with many implications.

Others have said this before me so I can't claim it as my own, but the price of a bitcoin in fiat is LITERALLY the least interesting thing about Bitcoin.
People who obsess about the price of a thing are fucking plebes. Price is a poor indicator, at best, of a thing's real value.
I'm an arrogant programmer snob who couldn't give 2 shits about money, though (even though it keeps coming my way... in fact the more I run away from it as a motivator, the more it seems to find me, which I find curiously paradoxical). I've worked for startups for over 10 years, for as little as $40k/yr (and that was only 3 years ago after I was at a different job making $90k) to as much as $120k/yr and I STILL don't care about money. I care about interesting problems and feeling like I am absolutely destroying boring repetitive work by building cool-ass programs. And following that has done me good.
Don't be a plebe. Find your muse. Play with something new. Create shit that didn't exist before. Learn a new thing, like programming... or a martial art... or ANY art. Discover the unknown. Try something new. Get out of your routine. Fire your boss and wing it. Help a neighbor kid. Play hooky and go to the beach and bring a Bukowski book. Today's the day.

@_date: 2014-03-03 04:20:39
no. [security through obscurity]( is bad. "obscurity" in this case is hiding an unencrypted private key in a safe. [BIP0038 encrypted private keys]( are brute force resistant which means any attempt to brute force the password will simply take far too long to be feasible with any computer that will come out in the next 5-10 years at least.
You don't want to assume your key is hidden, base some of your security on that, and then it turns out it's not actually hidden. Best to encrypt it correctly and distribute it everywhere

There was a Mormon bitchfest on Reddit a while back. And this one guy shows up, and he makes like this fucking *valiant* defense of Mormonism. Talks about the principle of continuous revelation and all that (yes, I remember this), and even though intellectually I read "continuous revelation" and I think "we can change the rules at any time and shit's still honky dory," the way this guy was going about the Mormon defense, impassioned and seemingly intelligent and all... I was extremely impressed, I have to say. Whether he was correct or not from a truthy standpoint, that dude had *heart*.
Something sorely missing in this day and age.
If I met that man, I would buy us 2 shots of whiskey and a glass of milk, and then I would drink his shot (because he's Mormon) and my shot (because I'm GSpotAssassin) while he chugs his manly milk and say "at least you BELIEVE, motherfucker! Here's to you."
It is my humble opinion at the tender age of 41 that believing in something IS what gives things their "intrinsic value". Whatever that thing is. Maybe even Mormonism. ;)

I think the government will start to crack down on cash use; it's already starting (see: all the limitations on deposits, withdrawals and moves of cash)
One good way to further gently encourage people to stick to non-paper, eminently-traceable, eminently-controllable electronic forms of government money is to get more and more lax about preventing counterfeiting.
This would certainly make counterfeiters and the government strange bedfellows.
Of course, one might question the ultimate wisdom of a goal that implies such an unholy alliance.

Bitcoin has to explain itself because it is decentralized. People are built to trust other people, not algorithms. We don't need to understand how the current financial system works because it has centralized players who we can ostensibly trust (the FED, don't laugh).

Because cloud. ;) Breadwallet charges 100 bits per transaction, also. And I haven't tried it, but I'd be curious to see how it does recovery keys in the event your phone gets stolen or you lose your account info. I'm hoping they force you to write down a bunch of words offline and store that safely, and use that to do deterministic key generation for the wallet itself.
Electrum is fine I guess.
Or just the default BTC client. But the latter 2 require carrying around a laptop, which is less than convenient.
Which is of course, one of the purported advantages of BC.i.
What we do need is something easy to use with an easy enough workflow that results in security as well as ease of use. Which is cheap or free.
Note that I don't disagree with you, per se.

The problem is that Blockchain is only as secure as the combination of your web browser and their domain is.
This is why Coinbase decided to control the keys. The Blockchain guy and the Coinbase guy actually had a falling-out (or an "agree to disagree") over this, early on.
I recommend people use the Chrome plugin for Blockchain, for extra security.
And if you give it an email address, make sure it's 2-factor-authenticated. Gmail provides this feature.
And unfortunately (to the chagrin of likely many), I have to recommend avoiding storing Bitcoin or working with it on Windows PC's that you do anything else on, or which you do not keep constantly up to date with security updates. And yes, this problem needs to be fixed, before Bitcoin can get broad acceptance. Browser and OS security holes will always exist.
If you want ultra security with your bitcoins, use a hardware signing device like the [TREZOR]( That's "theoretically unhackable".

I made 2 bets, both hedged against each other:
1) I put a bunch of money into LendingClub. Yeah, usury sucks, but their solution is better than many others.
2) I bought a bunch of Bitcoin and miners.
If the personal credit industry collapses, LendingClub investments will fail, but suddenly people will need a way to buy things online digitally and without credit using a kind of cash... enter Bitcoin (and, I suppose, ATM cards used as "credit" cards). And ostensibly, value increase.
If the dollar gets rocky... enter Bitcoin.
I don't see Bitcoin collapsing that easily (and only temporarily). All it takes for Bitcoin to succeed is for world governments to keep mismanaging their own currencies and to keep erecting economic barriers in between sovereign nations. Bitcoin, like the Internet, sees control and regulation as damage and routes around it.

He's not talking about centralization of wealth. He's talking about network centralization. Single points of failure. For example, if Bitpay and Coinbase become de-facto parts of "using Bitcoin," then all a regulator would have to do to seriously harm Bitcoin is... *shut Coinbase and Bitpay down.* Get it? That's his point.
They wouldn't even have to shut it down, per se. They could merely err on the side of overregulation or premature regulation. Same harm done.

1) As a guy involved with Bitcoin who is familiar with the volatility, I would be OK with this.
2) You'd have to have a disclaimer somewhere anyway.
3) You could have a hybrid scheme where you hold onto the BTC for a week and you can promise "one for one" BTC returns *within the week but only within the week* and after that an exchange at the market rate. This would require you to carry a week's worth of BTC transactions (as well as the risk in the event the value drops). I guess it's hard to completely avoid that risk, but maybe you can try to share it with the customer somehow? Maybe split the difference between the new market rate and the old one at the time of purchase?

You can't secure any technology on a platform that is known insecure by nature.
You certainly can't secure a technology that doesn't allow you to trace where the money went.
This is why hackers won't log into your bank and steal your funds with the password that they already got using the keylogger they already installed. There's ways to trace that money and international laws to track down the thieves. No such thing in Bitcoinland and may never be.
You say you're shocked that your online banking is already compromised even though your money still looks like it's there, and that the only thing saving you are the many banking and credit card controls in place right now, which are gumming up the entire system?

I was the "Ruby test suite czar" at my last job. I also reduced the total test run time from 40 minutes to 20 while increasing test coverage by 30% and reducing time spent fixing regressions by about 40%. I wrote a number of tools to help my fellow developers easily write unit tests and all of this was very well received by fellow developers until my boss got intimidated and decided to "put me in my place," after which I told him I knew he was just jerking off and leaving in August after his RSU's vested and to stop jerking me around and let me do my job, and later told him to fuck off when he tried it again, and then I quit.
This was all on a many million line monolithic Ruby codebase, by the way.
I quit back in March. Within 2 days (literally, within 2 fucking days) I had a contract job to fix 11 serious security defects in a Rails web app which was discovered by a penetration testing firm. I fixed them all in about 2 months (all by myself) and in the 2nd run-through they found 0 defects. Flying colors.
Right now I'm learning 3 languages that are new to me. At the same time. Haskell, Clojure and Elixir.
Last week I found out BOTH my former bosses are leaving. In August. As I suspected months ago.
What I'm saying is, I kind of know my shit (and am a bit arrogant as a result). And I am hard to bullshit.

I'll tell you what I did.
I take 12 characters of random hexadecimal and convert them to [PGP words]( The hex is the password. 12 characters is enough entropy (possibility-wise, it's 16 to the 12th power). I then wrote a nonsensical poem using the PGP words in order, interspersed specifically with non-PGP words (that part was fun) and I distributed stanzas of this poem to trusted people, instructing them to bring them all to 1 trusted person in the event of my demise. Granted, this last bit is low-tech but it works, I could have just used [Shamir's Secret Sharing]( to split the original 12 character key into M of N pieces and given those out I guess.
I would be extremely careful with a brain wallet, although I think you are still fairly secure when you're dealing with BIP0038 since it is brute force resistant. If you used random dictionary words, at least 5 or so, you should be OK.

Allowing Bitcoin apps circumvents their "30% cut of everything" (including IAP) business model.
I am BY NO MEANS arguing for this position, but that is what it probably is about.
EDIT: It's probably that, plus risk (allowing "money" to be stored solely on the phone suddenly makes iOS an incredibly juicy hack target), plus the fact that they're probably trying to come out with their own payment scheme. It's likely all of the above.
Thing is, they can't stop this. All Bitcoin is, is a protocol. It's a decentralized way to move sums around securely. Not even "money" per se... Just sums. Literally, just numbers. The "money" aspect emerges purely out of its utility as being a unit of account in this fashion.
And standing in the way of a new Internet protocol is (frankly) fucking dumb.

Banning it will only make it stronger. The countries that haven't banned it will simply use it as a foil against the countries that have. It is always better to figure out how to work with a new technology than to ban it, because technologies are amoral and Bitcoin serves many legitimate uses. The fact that the ones in charge might not like some of those uses (evading capital controls out of a financially irresponsible country like Argentina) is irrelevant, it would just become a black market and the value would *skyrocket*.
They should also ban gold while they're at it, because people can steal gold and its value is controlled by a market and not by fiat.
Banning Bitcoin is incredibly nearsighted and frankly, dumb, regardless of how successful it is.

Well, any name lookup would be centralized unless it was somehow embedded in the protocol and ledger, and if it was in there, then there would be a history of them, and perhaps not everyone wants that. I don't add the recipient's name to a list of names on a $100 dollar bill when I pay it to someone.
Interesting you mention DNS since DNS has been the subject of attacks as well as criticism for centralizing something (name lookups) on a decentralized system (TCP/IP).
What you're asking for is essentially a "BANS" (Bitcoin Address Name System). There is already an attempt out there to do just such a thing in a decentralized fashion- [Namecoin]( but as I understand it, it's based on a very old fork of Bitcoin and the code may be in disrepair.

Belief always looks culty to outsiders who don't yet believe.
Trust me, if you EVER believed strongly in something (without a plethora of evidence yet to prove you were right) and you're in the minority... hate to break it to you, but the others think you're in a cult.
I've been in many of these cults. The Apple cult (before the iPod), the videogame cult (yes, they were once unpopular), the programming cult (yes, it was once unpopular), the techno music cult (hey it's finally popular!), the Internet cult circa 1995 ("it will change the world!!"), the Ruby language cult, and currently, the renewable energy cult and the Bitcoin cult. Within my career, I am part of the [TDD]( cult.
Cults are unpopular and uh, heretical, by definition. If there WAS a plethora of evidence, it wouldn't be a cult, it would just be commonly accepted belief.
Well... Some people have to lead the way, here.
I've been right so far about 100% of the time, as far as "future performance" goes at least. Not bad for a culty guy. ;)
The future is often predicted by culty behavior around something. A certain buzz, the right elements: Some rebellious elements, some revolutionary ideas, a dash of the genuinely-new, usually some design, usually unpopularity or at least early difficulty grasping it by The Masses™.

Trust me, I'm not a huge fan of government. At best I see it as an arguable necessary evil. (Note: "arguable")
Also note that the reason politics is filled with "lying bastards" has as much to do with the "false dichotomy" that the current voting system presents, as anything else. Something like an [instant-runoff voting]( scheme would prevent candidates from *needing to lie* in the first place in order to secure votes. Being able to vote for only EITHER democrat OR republican is the problem (coupled with the fact that voting for, say, Green Party, predominantly steals votes that otherwise would have been Democrat). An IRV voting system prevents that from happening and everyone could represent their true opinions.

I've meditated. I need to do it more, I had a couple of odd experiences while doing it. You'd think that would cause me to do it more... but in a way, one of them was freaky enough for me to want to do it less lol.
What happened is I came out of a good session, where you're just kind of, open to the experience and not "asking" for anything or what have you... and suddenly (and with a bit of shock) noticed that I had a complete void where my "normal" fear of death used to be. It wasn't like I just had a reduction of it, it was like that entire concept ("fear of death") just ceased to exist. Gone. And it stayed that way for over a day. It wasn't like I wanted to off myself or threaten my own life- it was simply like, that fear of that unknown was *completely gone.* Within a couple days, that hole filled up with your normal everyday fear of death, but for a day or two there... whoa.
... I need to meditate more.
Anyway that experience is oddly relevant here with the guy talking about "terror of staring into the void".
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:01:47
Coinbase has a nice UI but remember that they hold the private keys to your bitcoins. When they give you a public address, you don't actually "own" that address because they won't give you the private key to it. That is a bit of information that you must trust them to keep secure. And so you are dependent on Coinbase's security practices (and to some degree the wisdom of their technical architecture). While I have a lot more faith in them than, say, MtGox, I still can't trust that completely, given website security these days.
Blockchain.info, while a bit more confusing UI-wise, at least does not keep any private keys from you. You have full access to them (with plenty of warnings) and they store them on their side ONLY in an encrypted form, because they do ALL encryption/decryption/signing client-side, in Javascript. Therefore, the only way for someone to hack your Blockchain.info account by attacking Blockchain.info is by injecting malicious Javascript server-side, which would probably be discovered fairly quickly. (You can still be attacked client-side on your end by things like keyloggers, but you can turn on 2FA to mitigate that somewhat.)
Anyway, I hope you find that playing around with actual bitcoins is as oddly fun as I do.

You could use an adjunct centralized trust system. And before you complain (which you should... hell, I would, but I'm also a realist), keep in mind that
1) With trust system, 0 confirms required
2) Without trust system, at least 1 confirm required
If you don't want to reveal anything, you can work on the no-trust system and wait; if you want to reveal just ONE public address that can have some trust attached (such as, for example: your favorite coffee shop, which you always pay out of the same wallet address from and which they can then identify as "you"), you can enjoy instant payments.
OR the seller could offer a slightly higher price for 0 transaction purchases which mitigates the risk for them.

Yeah, I know. But here's the funny thing. If you take away too much physical cash, people will start to realize that there is no "reality" to fiat; it's just a consensual illusion. (Personally, I don't get how people don't make the connection just looking at dollar amounts on a screen. Surely they know on some level that that's just database data somewhere?)

Yes, OK'ing a hit or "getting rid of the problem" or whatever he agreed to, is pretty bad human behavior.
What fucking part of "the incentive to murder WOULD NOT EXIST IN A DRUG MARKET IF DRUGS WERE LEGAL" is so fucking difficult to understand?
Criminals resort to murder when they cannot go to the law or police for assistance BECAUSE THEY ARE ENGAGED IN A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. So all disputes that cannot be resolved legally end up needing (more or less, ever watch Breaking Bad?) to be resolved permanently (or with other illegal incentives or disincentives such as threat of violence)
Did you ever read up on Prohibition? A lotta murdering back then which magically vanished (well, it migrated to alcohol fatalities, but I digress since that is arguably a different beast) once Prohibition was lifted.
Do you even understand that if you put ANYONE into a bad situation, almost EVERYONE will make the same choices? You're not as in-control as you want to fucking believe. Most of it is biology and circumstance.
If the cops think you're working in a black market, all they have to do is pretend to be a bad guy who's going to out you or threaten to do so, wait for you to flip your shit and resort to any recourse (because not to is to go to prison... Would you really give up your hard-earned multimillion dollar enterprise, all of it, instantly, without a second thought, as soon as some asshole threatened to out you to the authorities, because you knew you wouldn't "get rid of him" and the alternative was likely to go to prison and lose all your money?), collect evidence, and then in fact throw you into prison. Which is of course exactly what happened. And it's (more or less) entrapment.
Entrapment is very simple:  
1) Make an arbitrary rule that someone is bound to break because the economic incentives are too great  
2) Hide your real identity (notice that the first "deceit" is done by the "authorities," whether it's hiding behind a tree with the lights off in a cop car, or impersonating a dealer to Ross Ulbricht)  
3) Wait for someone to break your rule  
4) Profit?
Without writing a book here, we as a society should legalize and regulate anything that continues to go on despite extreme punishments. And then most of the murder would simply go away and the prisons would free up and... libertarian fantasy basically.

Still have most of them (sold about 40% in Jan-Feb of this year as the price fell from 900 to 600 or so). Didn't get goxxed because I decided Gox was a shitshow over a year ago (my bank at the time, Citibank, blocked their bank, which helped, but I don't carry balances at sites where I don't control the private keys, anyway)
I still think it's going to go to $1000 and beyond after the two ETF's launch. I just... wanted to enjoy some USD profits and mitigate risk (an absurd percentage of my net worth was in Bitcoin as I entered this year)
Lucky? Nah, just 1) balls and 2) I am a programmer and know a good technical idea when I see one ;)
It may sound a bit cocky to say I had balls but I literally cashed out half my retirement savings, paying penalties, *while unemployed at the time,* to throw money at this thing (and oh, *did my parents bitch about that at the time!*). I really thought this was a genuinely new idea which I thought could take off. And I stuck with it through some wild swings, which can take a lot of fortitude when it's like 80% of your net worth on paper ;) Fortunately I'm a startup guy and I'll work for crap money if the work is interesting so I wasn't too attached to the value.
I think I'm pretty good at timing the market tho. I sold a bunch in April 2013 literally hours before the bubble burst back then. (Of course, the value now is still well above the peak then, so... maybe I don't entirely time the market right lol)

And yet we have real-world evidence, in the form of [Prohibition and its repeal]( (as well as [Portuguese drug decriminalization which is now ELEVEN YEARS OLD and the sky didn't fall](
Both of those links link directly to information on the effects of repealing laws which are wrong.


Prohibition and Portugal. As fucking real as it gets. Who's in fantasy land *now*? Did you even read up on those two, or are you just spouting shit out your ass for pleasure because it would make you too butthurt to admit you are even the tiniest bit incorrect?
You know what the incredible irony here is? I fucking hate drugs... I merely hate disinformation more, and I search for the "uncomfortable truth" always. (I am only OK with alcohol.) And I will admit when I'm wrong... IF there is evidence.

If all the apps that were put on the App Store were open source, then those requirements wouldn't be necessary, but because people need to earn a living and not have their code forked and the license violated in China (and because corporations, like it or not, are not charities), we have the current situation.
Basically, the need for profit and security in the face of malicious players, as well as simple societal requirements such as not making it easy for children to download porn apps, is what's shaping that.
Now, note that I am an open source programmer and a libertarian to a large extent so I don't necessarily agree with those decisions. But I understand them, and that those are the rules Apple chose to erect and work with. It seems to be doing OK for them (where "OK"="profit", although again, I personally do not let the "profit ruler" drive my decisionmaking).

Dumb question- Does this sit on top of the bitcoin blockchain? i.e. it's not its own coin, right?

I'm not even contesting that, they are certainly on to something, but anything not in moderation is generally bad.


It seems to be a large part of your point, based on the number of times you mention it.

Also, if you want a way to remember a long hexadecimal-number password, take a look at the [PGP word list]( With just a few words that aren't hard to memorize, you can get some pretty decent password entropy going (for example, a 4-word PGP phrase representing 8 hexadecimal characters will already net you 4294967296 possible password combinations, which is completely infeasible to brute-force if you use BIP0038). A neat additional feature of the PGP word list is its built in error detection (note: not correction- you'd have to add some kind of additional encoding layer to get error-correction, similar to what QR codes do).

Nah. The intrinsic value of a Bitcoin is provably greater than $0 as long as people are willing to trade using Bitcoin. The "carrying value" or what have you. If you think about it, this makes sense- if a bitcoin is worth $0 then it can't be used for trade, and if a bitcoin is used to trade for something else then it MUST be worth more than $0 in order to be used for that purpose.
There is speculative value on TOP of the trade or carrying value, but that doesn't mean that removing the speculative value brings the price in USD of a bitcoin to $0, because it wouldn't unless ALL trade in it stopped.
Also, how is book value an "intrinsic value" if the company represented by the stock goes bankrupt?
All values are subjective. There are no "real" values other than food, water, shelter, clothing, sleep, sex, real estate, wood, metal, oil, cigarettes, coffee and whiskey. ;)

They all said that at first. *Everyone* starts out naïve and overly optimistic and wrapped up in the emotion, and *everyone* thinks their situation is rock solid based solely on their current feelings, and yet the pattern keeps repeating generation after generation (and may be worsening). *Why* do you think there is such a severe financial penalty to the man in a divorce? Might it be to force people to stick it out long past the point that they normally would? (or, more likely, fake it and cheat) ...Just saying. I'm an engineer so statistics actually matter to me and I can't just be selectively blind to them, and a program with a 30% failure rate (at minimum) needs a serious rework. "Oh, others just married for the wrong reasons..." Nah, that's just rationalization.
If a plane had a 30% chance of crashing, would you fly in it? "Oh, other pilots were merely terrible, OUR pilot knows what he's doing!"

This is not about bitcoin. Look up! This is about "bitmessage".
And on the contrary, I think it would be VERY useful to have a private bitmessage network.

Since the messages don't have to support a common currency.
It of course makes sense for bitcoin itself to have everyone start with a common block. Not so with messaging.

It's called "signing a message". Assign everyone a unique identifier and/or just use SSN or other  hash it with another bit of information perhaps, and store it as part of the transaction. This will ensure that they only get 1 vote in; any further votes in the blockchain get ignored or don't verify.

Because of the programming magic of high security [hash functions]( (which are also kind of like *checksums*), you can construct a message in such a way that it is irreversibly tied to previous messages (or their hashes). This means, with regards to bitcoin, that nobody can fake a past transaction record without more than 51% of the clients out there agreeing on the change, which is pretty much impossible at this point (but not COMPLETELY impossible).
The point of a *secure* hash function is to come up with a shortish and (hopefully) unique result that is deterministically computable from an input string of any length, *and that you cannot derive the input string from the hash* (in other words, you can't "go backwards"... that is the "secure" bit). Now, theoretically speaking, it's impossible to have a fixed-length unique hash for all possible inputs of all possible lengths (that's called a "hash collision" when it happens), but practically speaking, it's possible to design the hash algorithm so that this hardly ever happens.
Everything else is just you googling the information and trying to understand it. It's not rocket science. :)
Here's a super simplified example. Suppose we have a ridiculously insecure hash function that does this: It goes through your text, for each character it figures out the number of the letter of the alphabet it is, and then it multiplies those all together and takes the last 4 numbers of the result. (If the character is a number, it just multiplies by that number.)
Let's take a message 'abc1'. That would be 1\*2\*3\*1 so the hash function would return 6.
If you change the message to 'acc1', the hash function output would change to 9, telling you the message changed. If you didn't know the original message, but you DID know the output of the hash function (for the original message) was 6, and you were given a message that *claimed* to be the original message, you could just compute the hash for this message claiming to be the original, and see if they are actually the same, or different, and you'd know right away. Also, I could not take 6 and figure out what the original message was- for example, all of the following messages would hash to 6: 'aaaabc', 'acb', 'bc', 'af' and many many more. (Congratulations, you now understand the essence of what an 'MD5 checksum' is.)
Now suppose I want to create a new message that is linked to the previous message. One way to do that is to take the hash output of the first message, and add that to the front of my new message, and then take the hash of *that*.
'6dad'  (6 is the hash output of the first message, 'dad' is the second message), which hashed is (6\*4\*1\*4)=96.
I could stick this output value on a *blockchain*, which would now contain 1 number representing both the hash of the original message and the hash of my new message combined with the hash of the original message:
Now, notice that I can do this *without knowing the content of the first message*, just its hash value.
If I now wanted to confirm someone's claim that there were 2 messages following each other in order, the first message being 'abc' and the second message being 'dad', and I had this blockchain value, I could verify that by doing the computation on these messages and seeing if it matched that number. If not, someone has messed with one of the messages and I deny the message's validity.
Now say I'm a clever liar and I tell you that the first message was 'f' and the second message was 'dad'. You compute the hash and get 96! The number checks out, so I assume you are telling the truth. I have successfully lied to you about previous transactions. Well in practice, the hash function is simply *FAR* more complicated than the example I've given and it's just waaay more difficult to "backtrack" and figure out a message (which would also have to make sense, btw) which returns the same hash value AND is useful to you.
I believe that in bitcoin land, the "messages" are transaction instructions, and the "hash function" is some variant of [SHA-2](
This concept, plus the concept of [public/private key cryptography]( gets you a long way towards understanding how Bitcoin works, I think.
I think that's the gist, but I'm probably off.

[Strongcoin]( will import your private key in a few formats. I literally JUST did this, actually... What I like about Strongcoin is that they AES256-encrypt your private key client-side with Javascript, so they never actually get an unencrypted copy of your private key, ever. (All they need is your public key to check your balance, anyway.)
They also give you a Javascript-driven keyboard to enter your password in with, so you can worry less about rogue keyloggers covertly installed on your system.
Lastly, they give you a direct link to a dynamically-generated PDF paper backup (encrypted of course) of your wallet keys, which you can print out and put in a safe deposit box. So even if strongcoin goes down, you still got access to your coins.
The only thing left to worry about is not forgetting your password. :)
If you want to go COMPLETELY paperless, you can use the "brain wallet" feature of blockchain.info to generate a private key seeded from a passphrase you memorize. Think about it, all you have to do is remember a phrase of a few words (case-sensitive, more than likely), and your password, and you have eternal access to your money (or at least, the money on that wallet), even with no record of it anywhere whatsoever.

Honestly I'm kind of amused at the apparent lack of interest in San Fran and NYC, given that I think BTC is [going places]( (notice how all the charts are ramping upwards), and those two cities are tech hubs.

Then still require people to physically show up somewhere. Or use two-factor authentication and robocall them up on a previously supplied phone number (one which they gave while showing their photo ID). Or, when you give them their initial e-voter ID (long number), verify their photo ID then, and flag whenever more than 1 vote comes from the same IP address, and examine those votes and penalize people for vote fraud. Basically, there are ways to mitigate this even if it's impossible to eliminate (it's impossible to eliminate in real life, too... I can sell my vote and take a cellphone shot of it to confirm)

I still don't see how a currency that increases in value somehow dooms it. That makes absolutely no sense. Can you provide a link to proof that inflationary currencies always fail? Forgetting the fact for the moment that all value is relative (and when we say "increasing in value" what we really mean is something like "increasing in value relative to the US dollar"), if the value keeps climbing (relative to dollars) then eventually it is worth it to exchange for dollars, for some percentage of people who are hoarding. And the value has dropped many, many, many times. Increased adoption will also help to stabilize the value.


To get an even greater return, perhaps? Also, right now I'd say that BTC is still extremely risky (as an investment). Why did people invest money in the late 80's when banks were paying 5% interest? :O

What's ridiculous about the argument about the corporealness/tangibility of bitcoin's value is that nobody seems to be directing it at the dollar, which is essentially just a burnable piece of paper which *a multitude believes* holds a certain value. It's all about the belief, ultimately.

I threw a lot of money at them anyway then, like a crazy person (and got in at a super low price on a rig). On paper, that rig (which was split into 2 rigs after I already ordered) has now paid for itself in about 3 months.

Anyway, me and my balls of steel doubled down and will be upgrading to the ASIC rigs (2 of them. Helps to have sold a condo recently. This venture is a LOT more interesting than stupid REIT's or other investments out there.)

Extremely useful... as long as there is some Internet. What makes you think the Internet is going to go away in a collapse? It's built to be resilient as fuck. Pretty much everything depends on it now, just like electricity, so that's not going to happen. If there was no Internet, I would quit my job and spend my days erecting wireless Internet... somehow. It is that important.
In any event, BTC is the best digital cash equivalent we have right now, and if personal credit collapses, this will become the go-to currency.

I had heard of Bitcoin, or it had crossed my radar at least, in 2011. (I'm a web developer who loves computers and programming, I generally find out about this stuff early on.) Then the crash happened, and it kind of dropped off my radar.
This past January, my girlfriend was a big fan of a show called The Good Wife, and she was over and watching it, and while I was gaming, she goes "Hey... this episode is about something weird and nerdy called Bitcoin, you should come watch." Well holy shit, I was flabbergasted that a prime time show featured a nerdy beleaguered cryptocurrency as its episode topic, and I got intrigued again. Next thing I know I am googling like a motherfucker, which culminated in reading the Satoshi paper. Then I realized that the value had rebounded, and a little itch in my brain told me that anything that can survive THAT kind of crash and come back stronger, is something to be reckoned with!
After dabbling in GPU mining which looked promising, or at least more entertaining than investing in boring traditional investments, I started mining in earnest with the first shipment of FPGA minirig units from BFL. At the time, it was considered insane to be throwing that much money at them... I was a little insane at the time (not to mention unemployed... I cashed out a 401K to do it... did I mention I was insane...). But I also knew that without risk there is no real reward. And I had a LOT of email exchanges with Sonny from BFL, which somehow convinced me that they were serious. So far... and especially after getting a job which is paying me double of what my last job did... it's been a pretty sweet gravy train in the last half of this year, lol. Before the block halving I was making about 20BTC a day (more than my job was paying me, actually), and when I started, a BTC was worth about 5 bucks... I hope it continues! I believe I will also be in the first shipment of ASIC minirig units, so basically... drinks on the house? :)

There is a fairly foolproof way to both keep your wallet online AND essentially unhackable.
1) [Strongcoin](
2) Use their JavaScript keyboard to type at least part of your password (or all of it) which is used to encrypt your keys client-side using AES256 and which they show you how to verify. For hopefully obvious reasons, make this different from your other passwords.
3) Paper-export your encrypted wallet.
4) Say goodbye to them getting hacked, them ceasing to exist, or you getting hacked and keylogged. The only real danger now is you forgetting your password.

It's really hard to estimate something like that with most kinds of "useful" work so...

This is anti-early-adopter bias, anti-investor bias, and anticapitalist. In short, whining.
Hindsight is 20/20 and Bitcoin was a HUGE risk for a lot of those people. Unfortunately, every new thing (including an entirely new payment system) NEEDS early adopters to buy into it and promote it in order to succeed.


Any new thing will only at first be known by the few early adopters. "Omniscient marketing" hasn't been invented yet (and would be ABSURDLY expensive). The only other solution is top-down government decree *and that's exactly what crypto currencies are trying to get away from*.
I would bet that every single person on that list was (like me) suffering the strange looks of people 2 years ago while they said "you know, you *might* want to take a look at this Bitcoin thing, I think it's going to be a big deal." (My accountant is now kicking himself.) Just like 18 years ago when I was telling people "you know, you *might* want to take a look at this Internet thing, I think it could be huge" or 28 years ago when teen me was experiencing HELLA backlash in high school because I would not shut up about "you know... You *might* want to take a look at a personal computer, these Macintoshes are amazing and might be a huge deal one day"
This is just how early adoption works. You either see the future in it (and perhaps profit) or you don't.

I never said I wasn't bullish, but let's not forget a few things:
1) Greed is driving a lot of this. Which is not necessarily bad, but hey.
2) There are still technical risks. If bitcoin is your ONLY position, you're technically a bad investor, even if you did all your homework first. You see, there are the "unknown unknowns" to contend with...

There was too much mania.
Consider this your cherry popped.
This is only the beginning of the Bitcoin story, though. I have worked in startups for years, this is kind of like a startup.
You either commit to it for the long haul, or get out. No regrets either way.
Many things in life are like this. New things especially.
(Re)read the [Satoshi paper]( Find someone to help explain it to you if there are parts you don't understand. Think about the ideas and what potential they might have. Get your bearings.
Look at the competitors in this new space like Litecoin. Don't just dismiss it out-of-hand... for example, I didn't realize until just yesterday that Litecoin's proof-of-work algorithm (the "mining" bit) is resistant to ASIC since it's memory-intensive, meaning that it's still advantageous to mine on your own computer and may be so for some time. This could end up being a "competitive advantage" to Bitcoin. And that is OK. I'm sure tooling will come out to take whatever the top cryptocurrencies end up being... IF cryptocurrency becomes a thing. Which it still looks like it will (to my techie eyes).
Things that are going to be big have competitors. Things that are going to be big have major VC money. Things that are going to be big are growing right now. **Bitcoin is all of these things... still.** As I type, people are scrambling to get up more exchanges, for example. I hate to say this but if MtGox is still around in 5 years I will be VERY surprised. The sharks are on their way, and BTC people will benefit.
And by the way, if you ARE actually suicidal or just depressed about this, I am always available to chat (or will respond as soon as I can). I'm really sorry, by the way. :/ I've been through the dotcom boom (and bust), the real estate boom (and bust), the dotcom boom 2.0, and now I'm involved in this thing but I'm in it for the long haul (which is really the best way to be in something for).
Also, never do shit *just* for money. Taking out a loan to bet on something that *only just so happens* to be increasing in value *right now*? That will always kill you. My parents are materialists... You do not want to be these people. I took shit for SO many years for not being "money-minded", a "go-getter", a "hustler". Well a funny thing happened while I spent my nerdy time and energy on *not-money*... Quite a bit of money started coming my way. Money should come your way as a side effect of something else. Do shit because it is interesting, or because you are learning something new, or because you are making a difference, or because you are making something people want, or that just makes you feel good. Running after money directly is, in my opinion, a chump's game.

If you use mtgox, get one of their YubiKeys, stat. Then don't lose it.
Make a new wallet offline, record the private key, then split it using [SSSS (Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme)]( offline into 3 pieces, print those out and store them in 3 places (ideally safe deposit boxes so your loved ones can retrieve them in the event of your premature demise), configure it so that you only need 2 to reconstruct the private key in case 1 gets lost. Then do not import this private key anywhere, send to the public key from your other accounts as "savings". Every so often, go through the exercise of reconstructing the private key and send some money from it to prove you can still access it.
For extra security, engrave the secrets in a metal bar using a hand-held engraver in the event the building burns down. (Is there a QR-code engraving service? lol) [EDIT: There is! Of course.](

I disagree. From  :
"Prostitutes overwhelmingly work outside the law. This has implications for their health that are hard to quantify. In one Australian study carried out in 1998, the prevalence of sexually transmitted bacterial infections was 80 times greater in 63 illegal street prostitutes than in 753 of their legal brothel counterparts.... Legally sanctioned encouragement of prostitutes to use condoms or access screening services, both major determinants of the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, is impossible because of their illegal status. Occupational health and safety law is applied to prostitutes in lawful brothels but not to their counterparts on the street."
You cannot use evidence from illegal prostitution against the idea of legal prostitution when the very evidence cited would disappear were the legal prostitution the case.

[I wrote this little ruby library to convert hexadecimal to PGP words.](
[Here is the source of the PGP word list.]( Clever idea, actually, what with the built-in error correction and choice of words.
You say you want to convert from a bitcoin address, which is in base58, to base16? [Well I wrote a universal "BaseN" library for that too, which converts from any base, to any base, given a symbol set.]( btc_base58 is one of the possible parameters to specify a predefined symbol set. Actually, I just added an additional test case for conversion of a base58 public key to a base16 (hexadecimal) number so you can easily plug that into the PGP word list.
One day I will actually release gems for these. I am an idiot for not having done so yet, basically.
After you wire up the right outputs to the right inputs, here's an example wordlist for a real Bitcoin public key (the one from the test case above):
    crumpled Virginia fallout disbelief
    guidance amusement repay consensus
    solo quantity frighten Pacific
    playhouse stupendous preclude December
    indoors photograph berserk megaton
    Trojan caravan tiger typewriter
The corresponding private key (I will leave the conversion to the bitcoin-proper one as an exercise for the reader) is:
    merit midsummer virus consensus
    reindeer conformist accrue yesteryear
    village molasses sweatband publisher
    tactics inception Oakland autopsy
    cement barbecue snowcap Medusa
    trouble proximate indoors concurrent
    brackish pocketful seabird hideaway
    dwelling gossamer uncut enchanting
    tiger suspicious aimless universe
    bookshelf
Maybe that's a little more readable/transcribable?
And just for a little incentive fun I'll toss 0.05btc into that wallet. :)
If you want to get REAL cloak-and-dagger, you can come up with a block of text that hides the above words in plain sight (HIPS) and which only uses the PGP words for encoding and only non-PGP words as filler. Boom, you have a steganographic text hiding a private key.
Since the leading 1 on a public address is a 0 in the BTC-Base-58 encoding scheme, and since a leading 0 is dropped by math (the same way that 00001 == 1), you have to add it back in at the end whenever your result is supposed to be a public BTC-Base58 address.

There would be no way for anyone looking at the Bitcoin blockchain to know that *unless you controlled the exchange where that occurred and the exchange recorded the transaction details*.
Simple thought experiment: There is a US dollar tracking system in place via the serial numbers on them. Records show that I paid out $20 and then received $20 from someone else. Where is the record that I just traded in and out of Zerocoin? What if I just bought a nice sandwich and then sold it to a friend of mine?
Trust me, if Zerocoin comes to fruition there will be many BTC-Zerocoin exchanges *and some of them will even exist in countries where they won't have to be regulated*. AML can go EABOD. Wanting personal anonymity does NOT mean I am engaging in something criminal and trying to launder my ill-gotten gains.

I don't think any of us are ever completely "there".
Your tests shouldn't have to change much if the interface to your object is good (which means, it's sparse and relatively unchanging).
You shouldn't be testing any implementation details- just "give object A input B via interface C and get back output D". A, B and C should hardly ever change (ideally).
[I have a bunch of gists here.]( A lot of them stub a test at the bottom, inline, for example [this bit of code to convert a "deep" hash to a "deep" openstruct]( or [this way of teaching Ruby roman numerals]( That allows me to just hit command-B ("build") in my editor-of-choice (Sublime Text 2/3) which verifies that my tweaks didn't break anything, instantly. If I ever mature these into gems or whatnot, it will be easy to move the test code into a gem test suite.

If they DID know, there wouldn't be 10 different fucking schools of economics like the "Austrian school" and the "Chicago school". **It would just be the "Economics school".**

Or just use [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme]( to split the key into N pieces, of which only M are required to reconstruct the original key (usually, M = N-1 or so), and then store those N pieces in a few places or give them to a few people or print them out as QR codes themselves (probably ideal) and distribute.
If someone has half your key, you've just eliminated a *massive* amount of cracking effort. For example, say you have the first 32 bits of a 64 bit key. Compared to not having any of the key at all, you've just reduced the brute-force search space by 1/4294967296 (which is (2\^64)/(2\^32)). For knowing half of a 128 bit key, you've reduced it by 1/18446744000000000000 (approx).

Authy the app is nice. And, if they want to stick themselves in the middle of the 2FA space by being a SPOF, then, I guess that's fine. Maybe that's *why* their app is nice, sigh.

I never understood the appeal of these, if someone makes a coin with a private key then that means they had access to that key at least once (during manufacture) and it is a gigantic trust at that point that they won't just run off with the coins' value at some point

Bullshit. The US Dollar deflated for years in the late 19th/early 20th century (look it up) and business proceeded as usual. [Edit: Looked it up for you. Read.](
Also, my money keeps appreciating in value in my investments and in the bank (well, not lately, but anyway), *and yet I still spend it sometimes.* So how the fuck does this theory work, again?
If you read that article, it says that deflation is partly a problem because it increases the "real value" of debt. So if I owe you 10 bitcoins which are worth 1000 dollars today, in a year they'll maybe be worth 2000 dollars... So basically, *disincentivizing debt is a problem*. Seriously? I mean, I know that large capital investments require leverage usually, but maybe it's time to gather actual cash up instead of depending on credit.

The minimum value per bitcoin (the floor), given the market penetration and trade volume, is about $40. In other words, if the price of bitcoins was not being supported by buzz *at all*, it would be around $40.

Just an idea in the event of a client hang, you should not default a bet to "loss" if a win is not sent, if neither a "win" nor "loss" has roundtripped back from the client then the amount that was bet should be refunded back to the player's account. Just a web dev here with a tip that might have avoided the above user's problem.
(It's also possible that that player would have lost anyway, or did actually lose server-side but the result was never communicated back to the client. Not sure how your architecture works.)

A lot of people will advocate that you hold your own wallet (and secure it, and back it up) but I'm a fan of the blockchain.info/wallet wallet for 5 reasons:
1) They encrypt and decrypt ALL private keys client-side; they never know your keys. They also sign all transactions client-side.
2) They are convenient
3) Coupled with 2 factor authentication on, I believe they are fairly secure
4) They are free
5) They send you encrypted backups of your wallet whenever it changes (and also in the event they go down)
There is a small small risk that they will get hacked and inject malicious javascript that does bad things but I feel like the actual window for that remaining open and undiscovered would be vanishingly small and it has never happened yet.
My only criticism of them is that their UI could use an overhaul, Coinbase for example is much nicer (but Coinbase DOES have your private keys, it's just that they store most of them "sharded" and offsite. Sharding is using something like [SSSS]( to mathematically split the key into pieces.)

I really doubt they'd depend on (compromisable) client code to determine whether you won or not. What probably happened is that you lost and that result wasn't communicated back to your client in a timely manner, which was sitting there in the meantime just animating a wheel waiting for the "actual" result to be reported from the server, although without knowing their code/architecture this is just wild programmer speculation.
So you might have lost that bet anyway. (What are you doing betting 4BTC on a single roulette spin, anyway? Running on a totally new technology? :O )

Head on over to bitaddress.org, click Paper Wallet, select BIP0038 Encrypted Paper Wallet, generate some (USE A GOOD PASSWORD YOU WON'T FORGET), print it out (to PDF and stick it in the cloud somewhere, ideally, I think), send some coin to the public keys, DO NOT import the private keys into a client yet, just (for example) set blockchain.info/wallet to "watch only" your public keys. (Avoid giving away your private keys unless you are ready to spend those coins, IMHO, is the safest bet.)
When you need some coin, THEN import one of the private keys (such as at blockchain.info/wallet). Enter your password and boom, you're in business.

Why are you even going over the wire?? Holy crap, I think I better switch my career to teaching programming... You don't even have to go over the damn wire, you can perform this exercise with *no Internet whatsoever*! You just need code that generates the private key from a brainwallet and code that generates the public key from the private key. All this code is 1 Google away, you just need to script them together in a loop that searches lame passphrases.
If you want to borrow brainwallet.org or bitaddress.org's JS code for generating brainwallet addresses then just run it locally through a JavaScript engine like Rhino. Or translate it into a compiled language.
He already told you the public address and the amount of BTC so there should be *no reason* to hit up a web service *at all*.

I'm already an entrepreneur. Startups are my thing. I already know the energies to look for. Paul Graham is my idol... [this book]( convinced me to quit my well paid corporate job and "wing it" in the startup world for the first time and [this book]( convinced me that Open Source was the way to go! I've done well in the real estate boom and both Internet booms. I've also suffered the busts to a lesser extent. But right now, especially after solving a major medical issue directly affecting my productivity only a year ago, nothing can stop me. To answer that in a roundabout way. I'm also 40 years old, though, and have been doing web dev for many years now. P2P has always been fascinating and BTC was basically right up my alley.
Ironically though, I am not money-driven. At all. I took a 35k a year startup job over a 100k a year corporate job and slummed it. That startup ended up making me... A lot. :) Not like A LOT a lot, but a comfy amount.
People know me as an extremely friendly, generous, good, smart guy. Who is a little arrogant/cocky. But I'm OK with all that. :)
Frankly, I can't wait to find ways to use these newfound forces of personal achievement and profit for the better good. :)
And hey, if I'm driving a Tesla a year from now, that's OK too. But that's pretty much going to be my ONLY excess (oh god, the depreciation on those things...). I am equally happy in a 10x10 room as I would be in a mansion as long as there's a computer there, a phat pipe, a good bottle of whiskey, and awesome people nearby. And some recent PS3 games. :) And, uh, ideally, a beautiful intelligent woman, of course. :)

Big fucking deal. It's being traded at 100,000% of whatever "intrinsic value" that actually has. The rest of the value is... Faith? Rarity? Belief?

All it's done is eliminate the 0.00001% of gold's value that is "intrinsic" and replace it with far more useful features such as transmittability, security, unconfiscatability, countercapitalist capital controls evasion, speed, infinite and effortless divisibility, and dozens of other features.

I second the guy suggesting you buy these "organically". Start with a small amount, pretend it's a big amount, send it to an offline wallet, practice retrieving the coins from that wallet, then go to greater amounts.

While the 100x gains in 2 years made possible by having gotten involved in 2011 or sooner are probably gone, there is no reason why 5x gains in the next 2 years wouldn't be possible given that you believe in the fundamental technology's soundness coupled with the fact that the market is growing.

Imagine if you went to someone via localbitcoins.com and you asked for the address where they will be sending from and before you even did the transaction you could look up that address and get a "percent tainted" for it, and refuse the transaction if it's too high. Something like that.

Banks are not stopping business with these people because they don't like Bitcoin, by the way. Banks have risk compliance policies (especially after the recent problems) and if a relatively new customer starts moving a buttload of cash around, it will run afoul of these policies regardless of any actual guilt. They are literally just trying to cover their asses.
It might be possible to stave off some of this by 1) working with multiple banks instead of just one 2) slowly scaling up your business until you are more trusted 3) coming up with a clever way to swap BTC and fiat without relying on banks :O

The idea that I'm growing into something which is like myself but better, and that I am kind of participating in my own evolution (key word being "participating"), is a powerful one for me.
I abhor nihilism. I feel like it's a choice. If it doesn't matter in the end anyway, then you might as well choose not-nihilism. And that means... Whatever you want it to mean.

So the institutions are basically down to just transmitting bits, while accusing a brand new transaction/accounting mechanism of... merely transmitting bits. :O The only differences seem to be
1) Centralization vs. decentralization
2) Theoretically unlimited quantity vs. permanently limited quantity
One interesting thing I learned is that [the "bottom" value of a unit of currency DOES exist and is directly related to its transaction volume]( While this doesn't mean that that value couldn't crash to zero (as long as its use as a tender continued), it does suggest that said value's fluctuation would be moderated by its ongoing use as tender. Unfortunately in Bitcoin's case, about half of its current value seems to be "speculative" and not related to its "actual" value.

1) The more this is adopted as a payment option, the less the need to switch to and from fiat. And if you consider pure-BTC transactions, the extra cost is essentially negligible. Not to mention the time savings and reduction in red tape (at least at this time).
2) 8 startups based on BTC were all funded into the six figures by established VC players, just in the last 2 months. I would imagine that competition will drive down BTC&lt;-&gt;fiat transaction costs significantly in the next few months.


As far as stores of value go, those things have mass. Mass is costly to move, store, *secure*, and manage. And these costs do not go down over time... a warehouse full of gold is slowly sapping the value of that gold via rental costs, paying security guards, etc. So the ratio of "stored value to mass" with those things is pretty low, and very inefficient.
BTC has no mass other than the space required to store (50 * 8) bits of information (which is the length of a private key in a wallet). There is no practical limit to the amount of value that can be stored at a wallet address. The ratio of stored value to mass is essentially infinite. The number of possible wallets is approx. 58**50 which is 14838830640 times the estimated number of atoms in the universe. BTC wins.

BIP 0038 (encrypted paper wallet) standard was JUST released literally 3 days ago.
I know because I finally started my cold storage plan. I was waiting for this, because a paper wallet in cleartext always seemed like asking for trouble. Someone could photocopy or photo it and have full access and *you'd never know*.
This way I could just email them a PDF of the wallets right out of bitaddress.org with impunity. The encryption uses the scrypt algorithm which means it takes a while to determine if an attempted password is correct which makes it resistant to brute forcing.
Trusted people have fragments of the password, split via Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. There's a site that lets you combine them, it's not hard.
Maybe I should write a blog post on how to do this.

@_date: 2013-02-05 02:16:10
It's a scarce commodity (think: gold), secured and made scarce cryptographically. If gold became the main medium of trade in the world, it too would become very very valuable and the people who already had gold would become extremely wealthy. The model you read assumes that bitcoin use will continue to grow and supplant other ways of exchanging value. A lot of us are optimistic that this will happen, but it is no guarantee and there are still risks.
My personal bellwethers that this thing is going to stick around for a long time is if Reddit and Wikipedia start accepting it. It's already a good sign that pretty much ALL online gambling sites are looking at it, especially after the SatoshiDice earnings.

The Bitcoin protocol has some built-in wiggle room to alter the encryption.
What usually happens with encryption is that a weakness is discovered, hardly ever a "total crack". In other words, a weakness reduces the amount of brute-force work you'd have to do, but never eliminates it. (Or, I think that flaws which totally eliminate computational work are rare indeed, especially when it comes to algorithms that have been open-source for quite a while.)
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:18:38
They did say, somewhere. Their bank refused to continue doing business with them because the amount of money they were moving violated risk compliance guidelines. Note that it is not necessary to be guilty of anything to trip these wires.
Google "Sarbanes-Oxley". Then also consider the bank bailouts and the fact that it was because they took on too much risk. Now consider the risk aversion that would result from all of that.

Well, don't lose it either, like putting it behind a bad password you forget or whatever!
I almost lost 90 BTC yesterday because Blockchain.info just made one of my wallets disappear and I happened to notice. If I hadn't figured out to restore a backup (they automatically email you encrypted backups of your wallets *if you use that feature*), that money would have been *gone*. I filed a ticket with them but if they can seemingly misplace a 90BTC wallet, I can spend a little.
I'd still recommend their wallet though, but I'd really like to know what happened there.
This stuff is still super new and risky.

Importing the private key into a wallet app gives you full, 100% access to spend the funds connected to the corresponding public key.
Which is why it is extremely important to keep the private key secret, and ideally, encrypted with a password in the event you must export it or print it out.
Think of the private key as a username/password combination all in one.

In both cases I lost BTC and gained Amazon and spent a few seconds to make the trade. Eventually, yeah, perhaps you will be able to use BTC directly on Amazon. If that day comes, will you still be a pessimist?


Bias: I've made $100K on Bitcoin this year on those very exchanges (and will be paying taxes on it). Got in at $4, got out at $230. So one of us is an idiot with their money, and one is not, I guess... If by "idiot" you mean "overly risk-avoidant". I read the paper, I studied the code (I'm a programmer), I got excited, it looked more interesting to throw money at than my lame 401k Fidelity investments, so I jumped.
I also work for startups for shit pay (well, usually, except for THIS year), so I'm comfortable with risk.
There is NO reward without risk. Absolutely none. Not in money, not in life. If you are butthurt because you got burned, you need to heal up and get un-butthurt, or you will remain stagnant for life.

I've been thinking about this a lot this morning since you raised this point because I think it is a good and potentially valid one to raise. (It also helps that I slept 12 hours last night... Holy crap.) Your comment here I'm replying to currently enjoys 8 up and 8 downvotes, which is my favorite style of comment because they often hint at "controversial truths". So I'm upvoting you just because you dare to "speak the unspeakable truth," as it were. That needs to be done more, in general.
So anyway. I think I may have good news for you.
It *may be* that there is one entity which controls 25% of the bitcoins. To which I say, ok, so what, another DeBeers will exist. Remember that bitcoins are not just currency-like, they are also commodity-like in that their value rests somewhat in scarcity... But therein lies the rub. The more "that guy" hoards, the more valuable BTC get (via scarcity), and the less he/she can spend without dropping the value. Inflated diamond value is still value, but if DeBeers (or should I say  and associates) unleashed their vast diamond vaults onto the world (which would include selling them for things that represent other value, like cash), the price (or "represented relative value") of diamonds would crash... because all of these values are relative to each other and *not* "absolute". So they are literally trapped inside their diamond/BTC prisons, like some kind of Smaug.
Now you could argue that said individual(s), if unable to convert a large amount of BTC to another form in a short period of time (read this as: reducing BTC scarcity and therefore diluting represented value), can *still* enjoy a pretty damn high standard of living, as it were... And maybe pull some interesting strings here and there, via their wealth (like a Trump). and to this I say, this is no different than a JP Morgan or a Gates or a Zuckerberg or another guy who happened to be in the right place at the right time and who took kind of a crazy risk on something completely new. This hypothetical person is probably an interesting character who came at his funds completely honestly and not necessarily a nefarious individual, and probably not to be feared. This person arrived at these newfound funds the same way anyone who gets in on an IPO does, this is just a different kind of IPO.
You know who you have to fear? The likes of [Pablo Escobar]( That guy had so much cash that he actually lost money because the cash itself rotted away before he could spend it. (And the only reason THOSE characters exist is because drugs are illegal, which makes trafficking them simultaneously extremely dangerous and extremely lucrative, attracting a certain sort of brutal individual, but I digress.) What's the Bitcoin equivalent? An underground Bill Gates? The only evil Bill Gates has done is foist a terrible operating system onto the world, but I digress again :)
Basically, not to worry, there is no "enslavement" that is going to go on, that is the FUD talking. The only "enslavement" this hypothetical guy can do is drop BTC value *by actually spending it*, and he can't spend too much of it because then *his own estimated value would drop*. He could cause a panic-selloff by spending a lot at once but this is tantamount to suicide, so he's stuck spending a moderate amount. Lastly, spending MORE than a moderate amount would inevitably draw attention to him, ruining his anonymity. So, in conclusion, he might have a little fun, but that's it. Get it?
Anyway, the point of life is to be happy, and accrued wealth is only a potential tool to get there (not even a definite tool and most certainly NOT the only required means of getting there). The pure-wealth-accruers are in a sort of self-imposed prison, and not a very nice one at that (I know this, because my parents are pure materialists). Leave them there, BTC calmly and carry on...

Belief. And market forces.

Banks are not stopping business with these people because they don't like Bitcoin, by the way. Banks have risk compliance policies (especially after the recent problems) and if a relatively new customer starts moving a buttload of cash around, it will run afoul of these policies regardless of any actual guilt. They are literally just trying to cover their asses.
It might be possible to stave off some of this by 1) working with multiple banks instead of just one 2) slowly scaling up your business until you are more trusted 3) coming up with a clever way to swap BTC and fiat without relying on banks :O

I listen to arguments, not ad-hominems. Using rotten language only weakens your point, wastes your time and just generally makes you look like an ignorant asshole.
And trust me, I do listen to actual arguments.
Apple's been pretty damn good about keeping malware off iPhones, because malware on a phone could be a catastrophe. Google, not so much (but that's the cost of being more open). I admire Android in lots of ways.
Also, there's a business argument (shitty as it is) to Apple stopping bitcoin payments. Their business model is based on 30% share of all app AND in-app purchases, and allowing an app to just pay in bitcoin directly would defeat that... at least until they have a solution where they can take 30% of the bitcoin, which wouldn't of course make sense if the app is devoted to just trading Bitcoin.
There's also rumor that Apple is toying with some mobile payments ideas that Bitcoin might be walking all over. I don't know.
Maybe they just need to alter their business rules to make it happen, who knows. They're big and slow now, not fast and nimble. Let Android win this round, if they want- I'm certainly pissed off at how Apple's currently handling it.

*Investment* money is just used to give others leverage.
It is possible to create a business without leverage. A startup doesn't HAVE to have VC funding. A business doesn't HAVE to have a loan. Stock doesn't HAVE to be bought.

By the time they actually ship, you'll be so far behind in the preorders that it will take you at least a year or 2 to recoup your investment, if that
Such is the nature of risk. The same rule, by the way, applies to startups (the first or second people in a new market or who are creating a new market or who are investing in the company involved in the new market, tend to profit the most). I've spent years in the startup space, and Bitcoin's numbers (and news feed, and signs of innovation) look *a lot* like a startup about to take off.
But more pertinently, you are wrong at the outset, because *they already shipped FPGA hardware just fine!* (disclaimer: I own 2 minirigs that they host, and yes, i preordered the upgrades early, because I'm kind of a high-roller, and the FPGA rigs have long since paid for themselves, at least on paper)
The REAL risk was preordering from them BEFORE they shipped ANYTHING. Which I did. And so far have nicely profited from. The risk now is IMHO negligible in comparison, you are actually exposed to a greater risk of never making back ROI due to exponential difficulty growth due to ordering this late.
At least, if you're looking at it from an investment point of view. You're better off just buying raw BTC at this point, IMHO.

Yes, yes it is. I used your logic against you.


You didn't link to *a single source* of your supposed facts. Feel free to eliminate this hearsay problem.


Who? Google? What are you talking about? Links, please. All I know is that Apple has defended patents, that's all


As I already said, iOS apps are **only one of many ways to program on a Mac**. Goddamnit, dude. [False dilemma fallacy.]( [Here's a way to build a GUI in Ruby with Shoes, on OS X.](


Considering that [Android accounts for 79% of all mobile device malware and iOS accounts for only 0.7%]( I think that security VERY MUCH is a reason behind this. Malware hurts Apple's image and user experience, so keeping it difficult to deploy malware on iOS devices would be a priority.


I will admit SOME discomfort with this (I've wanted a decent MAME emulator, for example), but it's a price to pay I guess.


Let me go down the long list of Bitcoin apps on my iPhone: BTCmon (great miner monitor), iBitcoin, Bitcoin Ticker, BitCoins Mobile, btcReport, BitCoinGold, Coinbits, Coineer, scanbook, Blockchain.info wallet (works fine and always has), Coinbase, and my personal favorite, [ZeroBlock]( which kicks ass.
Since 12 &gt; 0, you have effectively lost this part of your argument.

What the hell is "a hipster", anyway? My definition would be anyone that "a hater" hates. If you genuinely like something on its own merit and then it gets popular, are you "a hipster"? Because that's a fucking bullshit worldview. A hater worldview. They define each other, you know... A hater is a person who hates hipsters. Hipsters are people who were fans of something before it became popular *for reasons NOT INCLUDING its popularity*. (People that are fans of something AFTER it becomes popular are "posers".) I say all these terms are fucking bullshit mind-tripe and you either like something or you don't and any feelings you have around what other people like is literally and completely useless.
Feelings are not facts. Feelings are emotions. Terms like "hipster" are feeling-based attributions. Hence bullshit.

Fine. OK, now everybody has a gun. Women, children, crazy people, drunk people, teens with emotional problems, sane people, cops, and rednecks. In theory, nobody messes with anyone, because anyone could have (or everyone has) a gun.
This, by the way, won't end well. Kids can't even have a parent's gun in the house without accidentally shooting themselves:
[In 2000, 174 children (0-18) in the United States died from unintentional firearm-related injuries. Unintentional injuries are usually caused when children play with guns or are hunting. Unintentional injuries from firearms represent less than two percent of all firearm deaths in the U.S. But of this two percent, children and adolescents are involved in 55% of these deaths. The majority of the injuries occur to children playing with or showing the weapons to friends. The easy availability of firearms is believed to be the number one risk factor for unintentional firearm deaths.](


Meanwhile, it would be WAY easier for a "bad person" to steal guns if everyone had one!!

Here's what I see happening:
1) You're mostly correct
2) Tools are developed which scrape away most of the anonymity by the time Bitcoin becomes truly popular (at which point any Joe Blow will be able to use it)
3) Controversial Zerocoin patch is applied after BTC reaches critical mass, removing most of its appeal to enforcement agencies. Turns out that this was the endgame all along. D'OH!
4) Zerocoin becomes a controversial fork among miners, splitting the bitcoin network in 2, causing all outstanding bitcoins to be doubled as zerocoins. The value of BTC drops by almost half, but half the new coins are essentially suddenly invisible. The price of zerocoin skyrockets and bitcoin drops as users end up trading bitcoins for zerocoins. This develops in parallel (and intimately) with the "paranoid secrecy/security/spying state" that the US apparently wants to develop into. They play into each other- the more privacy the government invades, the more people want to move their BTC assets to zerocoin. (This is similar to the relationship dynamic where the more someone has themselves cheated in the past, the more they suspect you of cheating and the more controlling they are.)

Here's the thing.
1) The places where the money is now, are probably not where they're going to be in the future.
2) So you want to find a place with a lot of early buzz but where the money is *not... yet*. A thing that you look at and get kind of a tingling about, but which not many people know about yet. It could be an up and coming band, an artist, a technical creation, an entirely new but promising marketplace, a forum (like Reddit... [I was also here, super early on]( What intrigued me about BTC was that it "died" (after the MtGox hack/crash in 2011) *and then rose from the dead.* Almost NOTHING does that. "Wait, so it was $0... *and then went back up to $4??*" So I was fucking intrigued. Perhaps it was informed by the fact that I've been in IT for 20 years and have never seen anything like BTC, yet I was able to grasp the concepts pretty quickly (especially having seen people pay real money for game currencies that only work inside games).
3) Enter Bitcoin. :) (or any future industry that is fledgling right now)
The thing about Bitcoin that nobody seems to grasp is that *it's kind of like an early-stage stock that anyone can get in on.* That literally *never* happens. Getting access to early-stage startup stock costs A LOT of money because you generally have to be an [Accredited Investor](

If I make a brainwallet from the words "offline paper wallet", then yes, the chances that someone gets the same wallet and strikes it rich by coming across your coins and spending them first thing is fairly high.
But if you make a brainwallet from "0fffllineee PaPeR wAll3+" it is probably fairly safe.
Or something like "offline paper wallet for &lt;your nickname&gt; &lt;your birthdate&gt;" is fairly safe.
For example.

Web dev is hard these days.
EDIT: Seriously, there is a **killing** to be made in web security consulting right now. Our popular site, which shall remain unnamed, has like monthly security audits of our code... And they find shit all the time... And we are awesome devs. If any of you are former "script kiddies" or black hat hackers, you'd probably make nearly as much money (except legitimately) by going white-hat. The karma is just a bonus. (Actually, if you are an amoral or subversive Machiavellian game theorist, there might be even MORE money to be made by playing both sides of the fence, but I won't go there. I am merely interested in the general integrity of The System, and I sometimes side with subversives whose higher goal is better System health; that is to say, leveling of the playfield. I am chaotic-good through and through.)
If you are running ANY kind of site that deals in money, you are literally an idiot for not paying someone to audit you. Seriously, you have NO idea, even if you think you can handle it. Things like gzip timing exploits blew my mind, and supposedly I'm pretty smart.

The pornography industry is larger than the revenues of the top technology companies combined: Microsoft, Google, Amazon, eBay, Yahoo!, Apple, Netflix and EarthLink.
Now consider that *none* of them have gone to Bitcoin yet.
Now consider that people who go to porn sites probably don't want to buy a subscription, they probably don't want their activity traced back to them, they *CERTAINLY* don't want these charges showing up on a CC bill...
Then consider the ease of bitcoin: A woman dances a tease, holds up a QR code, says "Just 0.1BTC! Just scan this with your bitcoin wallet app!" Literally seconds later and with just 1 button push on your phone, she is stripping.
Then consider that people who have bad credit or no credit cards can just as easily use BTC.
Finally, consider that the porn industry, despite being so large, is actually quite a tight-knit community (being ostracized by the same society that is giving you so much money might have something to do with it). The upshot of that is, if a couple of big names go BTC, the rest will follow.
Do the math. Sell and be sorry. This is early-stage.

In case doesn't know... I've been doing web dev for geez, almost 20 years now. The current gold standard (more or less) for password storage is thus:
1) Take the password string.
2) Add a secret [salt]( which prevents rainbow attacks.
3) Hash it with [BCrypt]( which prevents bruteforce attacks.
4) Store ONLY the hash.
When the person logs in, do the same process to the candidate password and try to look it up in your db. If it's there, let them in. Also, don't be a dick and store the candidate passwords, even though I've been tempted to do that.
When the person forgets their password, send them a reset link which clears their password hash and forces them to create a new one. The reset link will have a preauthenticated long random string in it (a token) which should expire once it is used when the reset page is loaded.

Please look into fixing it. I cannot overemphasize the difference in my life that treatment has made. (Did I mention the *other* positive side effects, such as that my income DOUBLED, or that I am a sexual tyrannosaurus now since the OSA was actually robbing me of testosterone?) All you have to do is take the steps.
The funny thing about fatness is that it is a destructive feedback loop with OSA. In other words, they exacerbate each other. On the bright side, if you treat 1 side, the other improves too. I've lost 35 lbs... in one year... hardly trying. When I am back to my normal weight I will be 54 lbs less than my max :O
You do an overnight sleep study and then follow the doctor's instructions. Find a good PCP and ENT. Typically you will at first end up with a high-tech air pressure machine (NOT "breathing machine") called a CPAP. You get used to it (I barely notice it's there now), it just covers up your nostrils and it's like a retainer. The point of this machine is not a permanent solution (in my opinion), it is to fix the immediate problem so that you can start the weight loss and hopefully get back to your pre-OSA state. The machine isn't terribly sexy but you can remove it in 2 seconds if your wife grabs your nads, and if you have an understanding wife or GF she will be VERY happy to not have to hear you snore AT ALL (a nice side effect of it is that it completely stops snoring- snoring seems to be a prerequisite for OSA).
When I get to my target weight I will go for another sleep study and see if I still need treatment. If so I will get an operation, typically at the back of the throat. My goal is to have NO appliances in my mouth or on my nose, in a year or so, if all goes well. So far so good.
Please look into it. You and your wife can thank me later. Feel free to PM me.
Oh and dude. I'm going to repeat... If you really are suffering from this, *your testosterone is lower than it should be* due to the risen level of cortisol (stress hormone) in your bloodstream which results from the frequent breathing-stoppages at night.
You know *what else* kills testosterone? [Being above a normal weight.](

Word to the wise: Don't ever listen to parents when it comes to risk. As soon as you have kids, your entire worldview switches to one of extreme self-preservation. Best advice a parent once gave me was: "Take the risks *now*, before you settle in."
Worst advice I ever got was: "Don't 'emotionally invest' in Apple." (this was right after Steve Jobs came back). I wasn't about to make that same mistake again. I'm a tech guy, I know what to look for, my gut says things to me. It told me Apple was going to come back from the ashes, and it told me BTC was going to come back from the ashes.
My advice: Don't underestimate anything that comes back from the brink of death.
And so I went in at $4. After cashing out 2 of about 6 401k's that were languishing- I was in between jobs (yes, I am a little bit insane, although I am doing very well now) and BTC was a new obsession and I thought it would be FAR more interesting an investment than fucking T. Rowe Price. Did I mention my parents bitched for months? (Fortunately I'm an adult and have control over my own shit).
Well, guess who's laughing now. I'll flip a coin your way to mitigate your pain a little. All I ask is that you help someone out at some point if you can. And take a few more risks. Break the rules a little if you have to. You have one life and regret really really sucks.

I've never met a Mac that was infused with virus software fighting itself and just slowing you down, or that opened a million ports without you knowing, or that installed "you didn't click on the right confusing button while you installed Java!" piggyback-style software like dumb IE browser search bars that intercept all its Google searches, or that surrepetitiously installed keyloggers because it downloaded something sketchy, or that exploited an IE security hole to root your computer when it went to a sketchy porn site, or that nagged you to death about daily security updates (which also forced it to reboot, losing all unsaved data), or that had about 20 different locations where a process could be started from at boot (half of them not having to be owned by an administrator) requiring intricate tools just to manage, or that would *fail to uninstall* (on Mac: Throw to trash. Empty trash. Done.) resulting in a completely hosed Registry (quite possibly the dumbest design decision in the history of computing... .INI files were better, at least you could chuck those without being a rocket scientist and they'd just get rewritten) ...You get the picture.
Nope, not a one. Can't say that I have. And my opinion is valid, having been a Windows dev, and network administrator, over a number of years (but a mac user since 1984... yes, before most people here were born, I was 12 and on a Mac).
And that opinion, clear as day, is that Windows fucking sucks (*still*... except for games). Especially for people who are not "computer people". Macs never have. The worst problem my mom (completely computer illiterate) has EVER had with her Mac is "WHY DID THE LOCATION OF THE EMAILS CHANGE IN THE MAIL PROGRAM?" :) I have carefully insulated her from Windows for all these years because honestly, I think she would come to my house and shotgun me if I didn't. (I, of course, am the "default computer guy" of the family, as you probably are too.)
And I'm a sketchy motherfucker. I download hacked things, I go to porn sites, etc... on a Mac. Using at least 3 different web browsers. Never had an issue. I run some antivirus software... *sometimes*... but it's only (ever) found 1 suspicious thing, in like *years*.
And for the record, I own a Windows 7 machine (let's call it my "Steam machine"). Specifically for gaming. To try to use it for anything else approaching actual *work* would be fucking excruciating. "Windows people" are like battered housewives, thinking it's all well and good because there hasn't been any *permanent* damage... Windows simply refuses to *just get the fuck out of your way*. OS X does not suffer from this. At all.
Sure, OS X being unable to expand a window to fullscreen is silly, and how it insists that there should be ONE menubar is a little silly, and how it's difficult (but not impossible) to customize in certain ways is silly. But jesus does it NOT fucking annoy me the way Windows does.

Honestly, I would consider setting up a virtual machine purely to do bitcoin transactions on at this point. There are plenty of free VM runners and friendly linux distros out there. Perhaps use a combination of that, a Truecrypt drive, the Armory client and/or the main Bitcoin client with an encrypted wallet to conduct send/receive. If you ever enter in any passwords, do it in incognito mode in a browser. For Blockchain.info, use their Chrome browser extension. Back the whole VM up regularly to somewhere offsite, or at least the file which holds your keys.
DO NOT give Blockchain.info all your private keys. Add your main wallets as "watch only" addresses and only leave enough in there in wallets with private keys that you are willing to part with if they get hacked somehow. Leave the bulk of your funds (private keys) in either the main BTC client, Armory, or cold storage. NEVER write an unencrypted private key to disk. NEVER generate one while online.
Consider putting at least half your balance in cold storage: Split the private key (generated offline using any of a number of methods) into 3 parts using [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme]( (do it OFFLINE using a commandline tool or javascript-page-based tool or something offline)... People will then advise you to use safe deposit boxes but I just googled and these are NOT secure enough- encrypt them and put 1 of them into a Google Drive account, 1 of them into Dropbox or something similar and give the 3rd to a trusted friend or family member, leave instructions with them in the event you kick the bucket on how to retrieve them, configure SSSS so you only need 2 of the 3 pieces to reconstruct the private key (SSSS docs will explain).
If you do use Blockchain.info for your "to-spend" wallet (I do), note that they almost LOST 75 of my BTC until I restored a wallet backup - so make sure you turn on their wallet backup feature and let it email you (encrypted) versions of your wallet whenever it changes! (They will also optionally store it in Google Drive or what have you.)
ALWAYS turn on 2-factor auth. Hell, use 3-factor auth if they let you... I use 2 YubiKeys- one just for MtGox and one I ordered from the YubiKey site for everything else that takes Yubikeys. I love Google but I don't trust that someone won't hijack my Google account somehow and get past their 2factor auth scheme.
Blockchain.info's current Yubikey implementation is weak. I'm not telling you this to bash Blockchain, but to remind you that everything in this world is still in its infancy and you can't take too many precautions (assuming you DO NOT FORGET any relevant passwords) and that there is, right now, *a black-market underground trade going on in site exploits*. That's right, there are known site exploits out there which are not broadly known about but which are being traded for cash to the highest bidder (ironically, probably in BTC). I work in web development, the interest being paid to security right now is off the chart (especially with the rise in cloud service providers) and new things keep being found. Your only recourse is to not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.

1) Coinbase.com makes it super easy.
2) You can buy them locally via localbitcoins.com.
The reason it is hard to begin with is due to money laundering laws. Any trade site has to comply with them "or else". Have you ever tried to buy ANY currency PERIOD? It's no fun either.

Well, I have heard the counterargument "The only reason why windows is a problem is because it is the most prevalent." This seems to merely be a restatement of the "Single Point of Failure" problem, and in fact IMHO actually argues against using ANYTHING that is "prevalent". Which happens to be Windows at this point. The only universal solution to the Single Point of Failure problem, is not actually having a Single Point of Failure... I remember when BlackBerry still routed ALL corporate email through their 1 set of servers and wondering how people seemed to think this was an OK arrangement, then they started going down repeatedly and I was like "you can't access your corporate email? all day? no shit, eh?"


In an ideal situation it is not possible unless there is a GUI challenge-response to the user. While Windows 7 is pretty good at this (as has OS X been, always and forever), older versions of Windows are not. And there is a *glut* of older Windows versions out there, which is a catastrophe waiting to happen (or an ongoing series of catastrophes, which appears to be the case- just look at the DDoS botnet out there taking down sites like Reddit)

No. Believe it or not, it might actually be *rewarding* to know you've made the world better instead of blowing it on consumerism or hookers and blow.


It's been eons since you could earn any bitcoins from just running the client. For as long as I've heard of it (which is admittedly early), you've had to run a miner which pushed your fans to 100% and locked up your CPU and/or graphics card. The work it did established the decentralized security of the network (and still does).
Perhaps it is that what the network paid you in bitcoins as a miner was far less than the actual value you contributed, which was the perceived security of the decentralized network itself.

I'm sorry but that's a shitty brainwallet and anyone who uses brainwallets with simple grammatically-correct sentences deserves to get burned so they learn a lesson in security.
The technicals of this is that your brainwallet phrase had an extremely low [Kolmogorov complexity]( which made it easy to brute force search with a clever algorithm that comes up with low-Kolmogorov-complexity candidates quickly.
The fact that a person needs to pretty much understand what Kolmogorov Complexity means before they even *start* using a brainwallet is exactly why 99% of people should not use brainwallets.
If you're going to use a common phrase then at least use your own alphabet (in other words, scramble the ASCII character set where every character maps to a different character, store THAT securely somewhere, and then use your brainwallet after it's been sent through that mapper). Although now you're dealing with a 2 step process and 1 of those steps is difficult to remember the details of without recording it. Defeating the purpose of a brainwallet I guess.
A good brainwallet *will* be sort of hard to remember. By nature.
You know what's a better "brainwallet"? Coming up with a random hexadecimal number N which you SHA256 hash to get your private key. And what you do is you take that hex number N and send it through the [PGP word list]( and then you memorize *that*. No, it will not be easy, but at least your shit will be fairly secure. Depending on how long N is, which is how much unique information you are willing to memorize. Which should be proportional to the amount you want to consider safely stored at that address...
The nice thing about the PGP word list is that it detects errors. It won't fix the errors (you'd have to send your number N through one of a number of error correction algorithms in order for that to happen, but that will increase the length further), but that's a nice-to-have.

SOME bitcoins WON'T be equally useful if they are tainted. People will actively avoid them, affecting their value, destroying the whole fungibility thing, because that would mean SOME bitcoins are more valuable to SOME people than OTHER bitcoins.
Simple example: Bitcoin confiscation by law enforcement. Say that they want to turn that money around and fund afterschool programs at a new school (sweet!). That school doesn't want to be funded by tainted coin, though... so the law enforcement agency decides not to taint the coins... Do you see where I'm going with this yet?

What is stopping multiple people from buying a house? You could for example just own a bedroom and a share of the common areas. This HAS to be somewhat affordable at some level, within a few years, for most anyone. And you could slowly "upgrade your digs" from that over time until such time as you can own an entire home.
And you would actually get there much sooner than the day you make your last mortgage payment on a house, because you didn't give half your money to the bank via interest payments.

The problem with remittance via Bitcoin is that it *requires* a local market of people willing to pay the local fiat for the bitcoins in order to exchange the bitcoins for the local fiat... And if they don't find this market then they have to create one by underpricing the bitcoins and hoping others will try to profit via arbitrage... and by underpricing them they may have to pass that cost along to the consumer... possibly leading to a nearly equivalent cost of sending money as Western Union :/
The other problem with remittance is that it has no place in the end game... being when cryptocoins become anywhere near a predominant currency anywhere... People will just take the bitcoins themselves and not even try to exchange them for the local currency, meaning the remittance guy goes out of business... because all that is needed at that point is Internet access...

Those arguments use "hypothetical BUT CONCEIVABLE" arguments. A machine that can discern "good" people from "bad" people is *inconceivable*. As far as I'm concerned, it is impossible for such a machine ever to exist. Thought experiments use conceivable arguments.
If that wasn't the case, then I could use arguments like "Imagine a person who could be in two places at once..." You can't make arguments about reality based on completely (currently) impossible things.

Regarding Josh not being there on day 1, it's not like Dave doesn't talk to Josh, I would imagine, and maybe he warned Josh about you. Maybe he even misrepresented you. Maybe Josh hasn't gotten laid in a while, who knows. You don't know the whole story.


This is in fact a much more interesting question, but I see no evidence of you actually asking it anywhere.
Also, the fact that you're posting the link to this video of yours every. fucking. place. i look. really speaks to the fact that you are more about promoting yourself and making proper businesspeople out to be douches. Everyone has a bad day sometimes and reacts negatively to people who come at them the wrong way. If you weren't such a nerd, you would have backed off before Josh got actually pissed off because you would have sensed him getting pissed at you and broke off the conversation before it went there, like any non-autistic human being.
If you really want to be such a BTC community member, you can start by not trolling. And avoiding people who are getting frustrated with your approach, instead of videoing it and going nyaah nyaah like an immature child.

There's nothing about a brainwallet that implies its funds have to be spent all at once.
A brainwallet is just a way to encode a private key.
It's up to the *bitcoin client* to decide what to do with the [change]( In Bitcoin-Qt it typically goes to another internal wallet address that is pre-generated or generated on the fly; in clients like Blockchain.info/wallet you can have the change go back to the original address with a custom send, although this is not considered very secure/anonymous.

False. Bitcoin has intrinsic value as a *secure, private, decentralized, global, sovereign-state-boundary-ignoring, and highly cost-efficient medium/transmitter of value*.
Gold cannot compete with that. Dollars, even transmitted electronically, cannot compete with that.
If I wanted to send value (in the form of US dollars) to a random guy in Saudi Arabia, I'd have no idea how to do that easily. But if he gave me a public address, boom, he's got value! Literally in 1 second. Bank wire takes a full day and costs fees and may run into stupid government regulations.
I don't even mind if it is designed to constantly increase in value. I consider that an anti-conspicuous-consumption force, an encouragement to save and not spend unless necessary.

I thought about this. The problem with science-based proof-of-work is that it has a lack of predictability of difficulty estimation. Let's take protein folding for example. Say you award a block whenever a solution is found to fold a protein into a certain configuration. You can find that on the first try or the millionth try, but there is no way to say "finding the folding of this protein should take *around 100,000 tries*.
With the BTC proof of work algorithm, you can. If you tell it to find a hash that starts with 6 zeroes, you can definitively say "this should take around 15 minutes" (for example). It's really hard to do that with science-based work AND make it cryptographically secure. It would vary by protein, for example, so you'd have to limit it to a set of proteins, and then you can't do work with new proteins unless you figure out how to ballpark-estimate the work required, and there's a huge incentive to cheat on that estimation, etc.
You'd basically need an unbiased committee that queued up work with an as-accurate-as-possible estimation of the work it would require to get to a solution, and ideally it would increase in orders of magnitude based on some other variable that you could scale (which is how difficulty works). There's very few real-world problems that are that flexible.

Does it make them more sue-able? I don't think so... I think a better question would be "Are they a registered U.S. company entity?" Unless they are magicians who are good at conjuring working shit out of thin air, they have been shipping a lot of physical hardware from *somewhere,* that's all I care about. I do know that they are very close to Josh's hosting operation but I'd have to go through my email history to see where that is.

Nope, you forgot the part where they sold FPGA units for quite a while, I own 2 rigs, and they have paid for themselves by putting out a more or less constant 50GH/s for *months* now, and are now putting out gravy, they stopped selling them because it is no longer justifiable to sell a technology when the next imminent technology is going to be 10x-40x faster at the same cost, they are a startup so perhaps their offices are in transition because they are likely growing fast so they stick to a PO box (I've worked at startups, that is not atypical during a growth phase as you don't want to have to keep re-informing people of your new mailing address), as a person who also programs in the engineering space I am well-familiar with unexpected delays in finalizing a product, I have no idea how the fact that Sprint carries their numbers makes any fucking difference whatsoever (who even uses a land-line anymore? Nobody at any of the last 3 tech companies I've worked at even *has* a land line in the office! Granted, they are all startups, just like BFL is), and for an ex-con, the CEO seems to be doing damn well right now... *legally*.

@_date: 2013-04-09 02:03:10
That's a very good question.
The assumption I will make is that there is an ethereal "value" underlying all of these "carriers of value" (currency, gold, bitcoin, whatever) and that the hypothetical quantity of this "value" (which we can only measure numerically via something like a currency and then only approximately) is not actually created or destroyed (or it is, but only in small part).
So what actually happens in the situation where one measure rises up against another, is that "value" has fled from one measure to the next (by exchanging more of one for less of the other) and the forces of supply and demand do the rest. I think that in Bitcoin's case, many people in a short period of time decided that it was better to hold value in a deflationary medium that cannot be tampered with than in an inflationary one which can.
Now you might argue that if 1 bitcoin is going for 180 dollars and I possess 100 BTC, then I have 18K dollars worth of value... but this is of course only an approximation, because as I hypothetically exchange those 100BTC for dollars I will slightly decrease the value of each bitcoin and slightly increase the value of each dollar, and from this we can see that I will only get nearly the stated value if no other agents act. As soon as too many [jump on the floor at once]( Collapse!
But what is actually happening in the case of a "collapse" or "sell-off"? Remember that no value is actually created or destroyed (for the most part). It has just moved out of bitcoin and back to dollars... where it is only as safe as the trust in the dollar is. And there is another horde of people who have more faith in the BTC than in the dollar (or whatever local currency they fled to) and have been waiting for a price drop to buy, and they fill it back up to its "natural, market" value... whatever that is. Fear (in the form of panic) is the mindkiller.
So it seems to me that ultimately, the question will eventually boil down to, where will most people consider their irreducible "value" held safest? In a counterfeitable, confiscatable, theft-prone, analog by design, constantly-devaluing-via-inflation, heavy, expensive-to-transmit, requires DAYS to transmit (see: bank transfers or bank wires), requires-expensive-banks-to-hold medium? Or in an impossible to counterfeit, impossible to confiscate, nearly impossible to steal (if the correct precautions are taken), digital by design, deflationary-by-design, weightless, nearly free to transmit, nearly instant to transmit anywhere in the world where the Internet reaches, requires-no-bank-intermediaries medium?
Which do you think the 3rd world, which currently enjoys more cellphones than banks or credit cards, will embrace?
Which do you think the citizens of corrupt totalitarian or dictatorship leaders who attempt to exercise too much control over their own national currency, will embrace?
Which do you think people who for whatever reason do not yet have a credit rating or cannot or will not use credit cards (children are a simple example) but who still want to make online purchases, will embrace?
Which do you think a cash-free society will embrace?
Which will work with any cellphone with a camera (not requiring bluetooth, or NFC, or any other more advanced technology)?
I think THAT is the ultimate question.

[Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme](
A way to "shard" a key or password into pieces whereby you only need M of N total pieces to reconstruct the original key (you get to pick what values M and N are).
Some pretty slick math behind that. Has to do with each shard being a coordinate in a multidimensional space and if you have enough coordinates you can determine the exact point in that space which is your original key (since all information is just numbers).

4) Think of this as a high stakes poker game and you're the player who won't shut up about how down you are in the chip department. It would be better for everyone concerned, since you clearly have no risk tolerance, to step away from the table, ask for a refund and STFU.

I would like to know if there is a legal reason for this. Beware of [FUD](
Apple doesn't want things like private keys to money or money-like entities stored inside the app on the device. *This is a sensible rule,* even if you don't like it personally. Imagine the lawsuit if some guy only stored his private keys on the iPhone and a software corruption issue eliminated them.
The Coinbase app SEEMED like it was just an embedded web browser to mobile web content on their site... But perhaps they were storing important information locally, which might violate Apple's rules.
For the record, the Blockchain app does still appear to be available on the App Store, and the copy I have on my device lets me send and receive Bitcoins just fine. *And always has.*

You know what the crazy thing is? If "Mr. 10%" suddenly starts spending a lot of bitcoins, he'd actually affect the value of all of them including his own due to reduced scarcity. Think of what would happen if DeBeers started selling off all their stored diamonds, it would crash the value. So people who own too much of a certain good that can act as a currency or be exchanged for other things, actually have an incentive not to spend too much... Not only that, he'd piss off the other 90% royally because it would devalue their currency too...
And regarding tax, all the gov't would need to do to track your BTC income is have you report your public keys. In fact, filing taxes could easily be almost completely automated at that point (minus deductions) if you were an all-BTC business.

First of all, the Blockchain.info app on iPhone (which is mostly, admittedly, just an embedded browser with a camera driver attached) is perfectly suitable as a wallet. I've sent and received with it without difficulty.
Second, [you might want to reconsider your stance on Android as a secure native wallet platform]( due to the fact that Android is responsible for 79% of phone malware. And lest you forget the [Android random number "bug"]( (which some suspect was an intentional plant) rendering hundreds of Android bitcoin wallets insecure.
I'm not a huge fan of Apple's "walled garden," but it's pretty clear that their "gated community" sure does a good job of keeping out maligned intentions. Apple employs hundreds (maybe even thousands) of people to review app code submitted to the App Store; this can't have no effect, and (from what I can tell) is not being matched by anything Google/Android is doing.

You're not a very good Ripple spokesperson. First of all, you're defensive as fuck, and that just looks bad, period. But...
After reading all this crap, I still don't even know if "1 Ripple" has value. To me it struck me as kind of an "IOU." If it is supposed to have value, then
1) How do you actually distribute it fairly?
2) How do you bootstrap the value of 1 Ripple from $0 to \&lt;market price&gt;?
Bitcoins seem to at least have solved these problems semi-elegantly. And, as if I need to remind people, in a decentralized fashion. What happens to my Ripples when the DOJ kicks the Ripple HQ door down, hmmm?

I have no idea how you can still browse with scripting disabled. The functionality of 95% of sites out there (and 100% of new sites) depends on scripting to be enabled. I'm a startup web developer; this isn't going to go away unfortunately.
No idea why disabling trackers would disable the site. Those advertisers who only know you by a random identifier are really going to be hurt by losing your ad revenue and not giving you ads that are more relevant to you.
What the heck is httpsEverywhere? The important things are encrypted. Maybe assets, like images, aren't. There is *no need to encrypt assets*. It slows down the site at the cost of, what?

You're talking about having a password or phrase with a low [Kolmogorov complexity]( The problem with that is, someone is going to come up with all of these one day, sooner than they will come up with a completely random 32 character password or what have you. For instance, if there was a password hash bruteforcer designed around Kolmogorov complexity, it would try every combination of "special" numbers early on such as e, pi, sqrt(2) etc. because those all have low "descriptive complexity".

What is the evidence that societies that forbid prostitution are somehow "better off," anyway? We certainly have enough that do and enough that don't now to form some kind of conclusion based on some data, I would think.
Because a superficial observer would either conclude that forbidding prostitution allows wives to "let themselves go" since men are devoid of easily obtainable competing sexually-satisfying interests, or that married men cannot control themselves. Neither of these things is good. (I have no idea why a single man paying for sex would somehow be bad, in fact there is evidence that this makes them less likely to rape.)

Think of the source code as the cookie recipe and the EXE as the cookie.
(This is an apt analogy because all source code is, is a list of instructions, for the computer.)
If I gave you a cookie straight up, there's no way for you to know if it has a foul ingredient. Not easily anyway.
But if I released the recipe as open source, anyone can examine it, see that it has no funky ingredients, and then they could prove that it doesn't need any funky ingredients by making their own cookies.

Make sure your client encrypts the wallet, if you use the official wallet app. I forgot whether it's encrypted by default or not, but it's in the menus. For a time (like over a year ago) it wasn't even encrypted and people were scammed by malware/phishing sites which just searched your hard drive for wallet.dat files and forwarded them on.
When it comes to Bitcoin, your wallet's private keys are the holiest of holies. Treat them extremely carefully. Back them up (in encrypted form), print them out as a QR code and stick it in a safe deposit box somewhere (encrypted, ideally), and if you do encrypt it, make sure you NEVER FORGET YOUR PASSWORD. Unlike a bank, there is NO RECOURSE if you forget your password.
I heard of one guy who engraved his private keys on a metal rod and then locked that up. That would survive pretty much anything :) But even if you do that, you have to do the engraving yourself- if you pay a service to do it, then they get your private key (or at least, they will wonder what all those funny numbers are and get curious).

I'm upvoting you because you are entitled to your opinion and disagreement is not a reason to downvote, offtopic is, per the Reddiquette guidelines.
If I'm reading what you're saying correctly, you're complaining that people who have already accrued an amount of value (as expressed in fiat) are able to exchange it for another amount of value (in bitcoin) and that this is somehow a problem. Translated, you are basically complaining that people aren't getting something "for free".
The forces you are complaining about are far from new. Gold, oil, you name it. Wealthy people have always been able to affect markets. You can bitch about it, accept it, or try to get wealthy yourself. My parents, German immigrants, not college educated, started with nothing, bought almost NO pleasures (no movies, no dinners out, no fucking luxury whatsoever) for years, worked hard for years, instead they bought a 20 family apartment house in the 70's... and were able to send their 2 kids to good schools, meaning I was never saddled with college debt, enabling me to also save more money, enabling me to throw money at Bitcoin. That is unfortunately what it takes.


This was FAR from guaranteed. You see, as soon as the consensus is that something is pretty much guaranteed to make money, the risk is long gone and so is the profit. This story could have just as well been "3 world governments ban bitcoin; price plummets; winklevoss twins say they lost 3 million dollars."
And these two guys, like it or not, *helped start fucking Facebook*. (Note: I'm biased, I work for startups. I have worked for shit pay on great ideas because I was tired of working on shit ideas for mediocre pay, and let's just say that I am *finally* fairly successful right now after *years of fucking working my ass off*. Even right now, I am on call 24/7 if my shit breaks.) Anyway... Call them "guys in the right place at the right time" (aka "lucky"), or call them "really smart fuckers who know a good thing when they see it," or just call them "the sons of wealthy parents who actually have enough money to make money." I do not think any of these things merits calling them "douchebags". And, like it or not, *you must first have money in order to make more money*. That is just how it all works. The great thing is you can start small and grow it.
You know who is allowed to invest in startups? Someone who has been deemed an [Accredited Investor]( You know what the criteria for that is? *You have a million fucking dollars in liquidity.* If you want to be pissed off about something, **be pissed off about that**, because I'll join you (partly because I'm not one yet, lol.)
Do you know who can invest in the Bitcoin idea? *Fucking anyone.*
So what, it took a dip. The idea is still sound, and it is still going to take off. How do I know this? Because *millions of dollars in established VC money has been thrown at startups based on Bitcoin just this year.* VC's do not just fucking [give you 500 thousand fucking dollars]( unless they have done the equivalent of proctology on you, your entire team, everyone's finances, the technology, background checks, credit checks, criminal checks, they know what you had for breakfast... you fucking name it. And that is no joke.
But... You are entitled to your opinion. Because it could all still crash and burn. Upvote.

Is it wrong if I think they might actually mostly be interested in protecting consumers/participants? (Which is in fact what the wording said)
If you have an issue with taxation (which is fine), it doesn't really apply as any "legitimate" business needs to figure out how to pay taxes on profit or capital gains anyway, regardless of personal opinion on taxes.
For everything else there will always be "secret wallet keys" aka "cash."
Remember that the SEC exists and permits what is essentially "high stakes legalized gambling" aka stock trading. If BTC were to become a securitized asset in any form (which is what I believe the Winklevii are gunning for, love em or hate em), then the SEC's involvement is just around the corner.
Like it or not, increased (sane) regulation will boost the value of coins as more risk-averse entrants enter the Bitcoin market.
For the record, storing (not exchanging) BTC with intent to accrue value is currently still EXTREMELY risky.

No. I used his person to attack his arguments as a hypothetical.
My argument is essentially that the entire concept of "intrinsic value" is flawed because it has no merit when applied to a person or for that matter anything with a value, because almost all values are subjective.
The other part of my argument comes from the fact that some value comes from the frequency that a thing is traded and that this applies to both Bitcoins, as well as the meme of a person's ideas.

Your chosen passphrase has to have a high [Kolmogorov complexity]( which basically means, "how easy is it to describe the passphrase?"
The theory is that people will attempt to crack all "simple" conceivable low-kolmogorov-complexity passphrases such as mixed case dictionary words, common names, proper nouns, simple numeric letter substitutions, lists of common passwords etc.
The way around this is to add just a bit of randomness to it. So for example take your favorite phrase, give it some random (but memorable) capitalization, a number here and there, maybe a punctuation character, and as long as you can remember that, you have something with a fairly high Kolmogorov complexity.
I would still not use a brainwallet for any significant amount of BTC.

I dunno. I feel like I earned it. I cashed out two 401k's, with a penalty, *while unemployed*, to preorder 2 FPGA minirigs from a company nobody had heard of at the time named Butterfly Labs.
To say I was sweating during that decision would be an understatement, but the more I researched Bitcoin the more excited I got and felt I had to act NOW. There were MANY email exchanges between myself, Sonny (CEO) and the guy who is now the CTO, before I wired them that hunk of change. OH! And THEN when the news that Sonny was an ex-con came out...

Lost credibility at comparing fledgling BTC community presentation with Magic: The Gathering, which is a unified, traditionally capitalist business.
Bitcoin is open source. That means it is not only distributed but that they literally *don't have the money* to pay expensive and overly qualified marketers and UI designers.
If you want to see the sign of things to come in the BTC world, look at Coinlab's website. But they are a *500 million dollar venture-backed startup*. If they don't have a fucking fancy UI, they are doing it wrong.
The core Bitcoin dev team probably have day jobs which are not Bitcoin-related.
And I gotta say, as a web dev myself... Good web dev and scaling websites is harder than you think. To say you need to understand *a lot* at this point is an understatement. That is why I am paid $120k/yr without a doctorate (well, that plus the fact that the U.S. school system is fucking up at discovering and training good new developers).
If you want to end up in a good place, become a craftsman at something. Anything. It doesn't have to be tech. It just has to involve creativity and technical skill.

Let's just say I went in big at $4 when almost nobody had heard of this thing (I was pretty much one of the first few BFL minirig preorders and even while wiring them my money I thought I was a little insane... but I know that without risk there is no reward because most people are too risk-averse and hold their money too tightly... also I had some cash to spend and putting it into a money market seemed like just about the most boring idea ever compared to a *virtual miner for a global decentralized uncounterfeitable motherfucking cryptocurrency that was only used on the edgiest of internet sites*)

The scarcity of dollars affects dollar value. This is something nobody realizes.
Something else nobody seems to realize is that there is no gold backing the dollar anymore. There are no more "pounds sterling" backing the British pound anymore. Their values are based on pure belief and scarcity... just like BTC.
If it wasn't for that, dollars would just be fancy pieces of paper and BTC would just be a string of 50 digits.

Well, wrong in practice. At some point of complexity, it becomes more profitable to just run mining software than to use that CPU to bruteforce keys.
That is in fact the whole point of mining software. Miners make money by running the same hash algorithms that you would have to run to bruteforce the network. And thus the network stays more secure as a result.

This is seriously news to you? That most people are not actually interested in the jarring truths of the world, and are really just interested in feeling good and comfortable?

You need to grow a thick skin if you love shiny things like I do. The things that eventually succeed are almost ALWAYS hated at the beginning.

And the computer uses a random number generator. Which means you lose. Because too many random number generators lately have been shown to be extremely suspicious or to have actual flaws. You have to understand that computer-generated random numbers are not technically *truly random*. They only look and act random, they might statistically analyze as being unbiased (and therefore look random), but they are ultimately generated by a set of rules (an algorithm) and therefore there can be a flaw... or a backdoor.

There is no kicking in the balls going on, and save for something like an economically catastrophic unleashing of the 3 trillion US dollars that China has in reserve onto the market (sinking the dollar rather suddenly), all transitions will be gradual enough to give everyone a chance to adjust. Fiat isn't going anywhere anytime soon as many people still sit outside regular Internet or cell connection so we will need the paper for a long time to come. But I don't see how an increasing BTC marketshare is any kind of "fuck you" to the non-Internet-savvy any more than an increasing "Internet household" marketshare is. All it might do is lead to an *imperceptibly* increased USD inflation rate which might *imperceptibly* affect savings denominated in USD...

How is the IRS going to possibly make estimates based on a completely new technology/idea? How is that even enforceable, unless they audit my machine and force me to reveal the password to decrypt the private keys holding these funds? Are they going to ask me the hashrate of my miners and investigate the historical difficulty and project based on that? I'm pretty sure they are still years away from that. (If they aren't, then I would be extremely impressed.)
So, similar to when I am an all-cash business, I have to be honest in my reporting and they have to depend on that.
The best they could do is demand to know the public wallet id's that my transactions passed through, and from that they already have all the records themselves (I guess that's the beauty of Bitcoin, it's only anonymous until someone connects a wallet ID to you, and then it's startlingly public). In fact, I would guess that this is eventually what is going to happen. Blockchain.info would tell them all the rest of what they wanted to know.
Also, it was me that proposed that they are barterable items instead of taxable currency, not you.
The jury is still out on how bitcoin possession and trade is going to be treated by the law. Heck, the jury is still out on what a bitcoin *is*, other than "something that seems to hold value".

BTC is essentially digital gold. It is mined, there is a fixed amount of it in the world, it is discovered at a decreasing rate, it can be used as a medium of value exchange, and if I give you some, I don't get to keep a copy for myself (due to cryptographic security and the global blockchain, in BTC's case).
It is also growing in use daily. And yet its current penetration into the world e-commerce market is just a drop in a bathtub. All startup ideas start out this way. Which reminds me, not a day seems to go by when a new Bitcoin-related startup isn't announced. That's what happens when something's about to *really* take off.
Now look in your history books as to what became of gold.
If anything I think BTC is arguably more valuable than gold in the long term due to its intangible, decentralized, anonymous, Internet-ready properties.
People will argue that "well, gold has an *intrinsic value*- it is shiny, it conducts electricity well, it does not corrode." Well, BTC has an intrinsic value too, in that I can send you some right now, anywhere in the world, without an intermediary, at extremely low cost, without credit of any kind, without a bank account, without being able to double-spend it, and confirmed within seconds (if that). There is *fucking nothing else* out there like that right now which has the critical mass factor/network effect that BTC already has.
So, pray for it to dip, but don't be surprised if it recovers in seconds, because it's "all eyez on me" time for BTC.

Note that the [2-4% year-over-year drop in value that the US dollar loses to inflation]( acts directly against any bank interest rate, so if they're not offering more than 4%, you are literally bleeding value over time (relative to other currencies, which is all that matters).

@_date: 2013-02-27 17:19:32
The "Wallet" is 2 parts, the public part (which you can pretty much instantly derive from the private part, mathematically) and the private part (which you cannot, at least without thousands of years of computing power, derive from the public part).
Each of these is just a longish string of alphanumeric numbers that is ridiculously hard to guess.
You just give them the public part. It's the private part which allows you to spend money sent to the public part.

There are 8+ startups in the Bitcoin space that have all been funded hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The difference in speed between how quickly a government moves and how quickly a startup moves is about the same as the difference between the speed of sound and the speed of light.
(Disclaimer: I have been a developer working at startups for 8+ years, and quit corporate jobs, for this very reason. You would have to shoot me to take a government job... security is worthless to me unless the work is interesting!)
I really don't think we have anything whatsoever to worry about.
The reason why tech startups are hot again is that, perhaps due to having gone through TWO busts in the past 15 years and having to figure out how to run "lean," they have gotten extremely productive at turning ideas into real-world engineering, of late. There are developments going on in this space right now, which are *not* just applicable to application development but to engineering in general, that will fall out into other disciplines for years to come. These folks are practically working in the future, compared to the machinations of government. As a simple example look at [wikispeed]( which is "open source as applied to car design". The source-control tools Git and Github alone have been almost a nuclear-bomb as far as collaborative teamwork is concerned, I have seen nothing else like this level of productivity in my life in any other discipline, period. And the habit of writing fast-as-possible unit tests for everything actually proves your work was successful, ensures nothing crucial gets broken (at least across the realm of ways you can think of breaking things) and nothing once broken will ever break again (since it is covered by a test).
Open-source alone is a paradigm shift which has not taken enough root. [The entire Bitcoin machine is open and available for all to see]( Anyone willing and able can go and try to look for a security flaw. Let's see a government open-source a competing idea... those guys don't know the advantage of "open" if it uppercut them in the face.
All I can say is "good luck, government".

Dude, there is a great difference between *pricing things in Bitcoins* and *offering a price in Bitcoin*. Pretty sure they simply meant the former, not the latter.

Hey, me again. :)
I don't know if it will "fix healthcare" but maybe, eh... What about educational programs? Is it possible to figure out how to help some of these folks help themselves? I'm all for teaching a man to fish instead of continuing to give them fishes forever (if the former option is available). Maybe social workers to get them any mental health assistance as that seems to often underlie these situations?
Regardless, thanks for doing what you do for our fellow humans in the world and maybe you can fit a few toothbrushes and toothpaste in with the doctor visits (dental problems start early in life if you're "off the grid" and don't see dentists or take care of your teeth, and unfortunately seem to distinguish oneself as more clearly economically-disadvantaged than other visible things...

If they gave you a coin with a public key and a sealed private key... they could have kept a copy somewhere of the private key. Theoretically. Just saying. Since they are the ones who came up with the keypair.

No. I will never claim to know anything for certain. If anything, I am included in the people who do not fully understand money. For example, there seems to be some quantity of "value" which the number of the units of money represent, but there is no absolute measure of "value". It is like rating a woman's beauty from 1-10 and then conflating the actual beauty with the numerical representation of the level of beauty.
For example, if a currency loses value, where does that value flee to? Well, it probably flees to other stores of value (other currencies, Bitcoin etc.). It doesn't just "disappear"... or does it? Can value be created and destroyed en masse, where monetary loss is merely a byproduct?

Did you really go through these nightmare scenarios without at all considering that all the government would have to do to collect taxes is **ask you to surrender the public keys that you are getting paid through?** In fact, filing taxes at that point would be trivial since everyone already knows what you made and what you owe (via the blockchain).
The anonymity is voluntary, and if you elect to give it up, your finances are *completely transparent*.
This is no different than how all-cash businesses are handled, except that it gives government an *even better* way to keep tabs on you. And all they have to do to ensure you are actually giving them most of your public keys is show up anonymously at your place of business, log the pay-to address, and make sure you're reporting it. That would amount to an "audit."
So quit it with the fear-mongering.
Now, nobody says you have to surrender *all* your public keys... Just those with a plausible amount of BTC going through them and which you are taking business money through.
And regarding anonymous child auctions, if the pay-to address is reported in the news, voluntary opt-in parties (for example, *all parents everywhere in the world*) could announce if someone tries to send them money from that wallet. Which, again, is information available *right in the blockchain*.

Citations please. Most of the ones I've investigated are bullshitted up.


I looked up old reviews for Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. They ranged around 5/10. Battery life and heat were factors. And they continue to be, on all Intel-based hardware.
The key technology that made the iPad (and iPhone!) possible is Apple's investment in [LLVM]( which made it possible to recompile a stripped-down version of OS X for low power ARM CPU's (without rebuilding an entirely new compiler from scratch, they just made GCC compile down to LLVM and let LLVM take it from there for the processor-specific bits) while keeping it fast, enabling FAR less power demand per unit of computing power. Allowing an incredibly long battery life, low heat output, and reasonable performance. The other side of the picture is Apple's "Core Graphics" tech and adoption of OpenGL ES.
I really don't think people realize how much of an old anchor the Intel i386/64 chipset is. It's a power hog for what it does at this point, because it has to support all legacy software. And it often didn't make the correct engineering decisions along the way.
Apple's engineering marvels are severely underrated. It is NOT all just "marketing".

@_date: 2013-05-19 01:20:19
OK, couple of things.
Do you know what the [Tragedy of the Commons]( is? It basically means that if there is a shared resource that many parties need to take up shared responsibility for in order to maintain it, nobody will end up actually doing it. As applied to petroleum combustion and its effect on the environment via greenhouse gas emissions, it means that without ZEV credit there is much less incentive to work towards this direction because the energy density of petroleum is still really high compared to electrical energy storage and it will remain more profitable to maintain the status quo instead of making a concerted effort into creating a transportation energy solution that messes with the environment less.
If all forces were left to natural capitalistic self-interest, what would happen is that oil would keep getting burned because it is always going to be cheaper to burn oil due to the gigantic infrastructure already invested in obtaining oil combined with the high energy density of oil. At some future date when oil finally becomes prohibitively expensive (assuming you believe in "peak oil", which I hope you do), we would *finally* turn to alternative energies such as stored electrical etc. but it would be long after the environment (the "commons") is adversely affected. As a simple example of the problems this is *already* creating, many believe that the [greenhouse gas emissions created by a China burgeoning with new industry were a major contributor to forces that resulted in Hurricane Sandy]( (I live in an area that was adversely affected by that storm- I lost power for 3 weeks.)


By building out a larger market for electrical energy storage (further stimulated by things such as ZEV credits), this problem will be solved by capitalism. It is already getting solved... have you heard of [supercapacitors]( Without some sort of stimulus, this will take far too long to happen "naturally".
I took a while to respond to you because you did get me thinking, to your credit, and I wanted to give you a fair response, and I do agree partly with your argument. Also because I think it is kind of badass that you built race cars professionally. ;)
If you like race cars, surely you have seen the 0-60mph times of electric (but still out of most price ranges) vehicles like the [Tesla Roadster]( :)
I actually drive a Volt (disclaimer?), love the car, it's still priced a bit high, but it's fantastic to be able to get to work and back (half hour commute each way) using only electricity.

I already have a paid-off mortgage. My car loan (Chevy Volt) is a 0% loan and the only reason I keep it is for the credit rating boost in the event I one day need additional leverage. I really hate debt, I was in the military (USAF) in the mid 90's and had to climb out of debt and swore it off (at least CC debt). Bought a modest condo and picked an aggressive payoff schedule, then sold that in the middle of the real estate boom and paid it off and had a bunch left over, turned that around to a new place and paid that off too.
I am fortunate to have no student loans because my parents paid, although when my grades flagged they made me pay (wiping out my entire high school savings, once, which at the time was over 20 grand).
I really don't need much to be happy: 1) a room 2) an Internet connection 3) a recent computer 4) an interesting job 5) a GF 6) 1-2 vacations a year 7) biking 8) friends and some partying. :)
My parents are extremely money conscious (materialist, actually) and pushed some of that onto me... Except that I have a much higher risk tolerance and sense of fun... Hence my forays into BTC. :) (I also game rather heavily... also just turned 41, fuck age, apparently... lol)
I've also been fortunate to be a developer since the year 2000, it's been rocky but largely successful riding out these booms. Love my job and can't complain much right now, other than being a commitmentphobe (talking to a psych about that).

Well, it's only a start, but [Buyer's Best Friend Direct]( which is a WHOLESALER, not even a retailer (possibly an even bigger deal than a retailer accepting it), is now [accepting BTC as payment directly](
This will continue to spread, fad or not, due to the fact that transferring money via Visa or MasterCard gives those companies a 3% cut and transferring money via BTC is 0% (nominally). Economic incentives are pretty powerful motivators.

I was using USD as an example for point 3. It has no intrinsic value. Which is why Bitcoin is fiat (even if it is not commonly called that). If USD is also fiat because fiat is SOMETIMES defined as "declared by a government to be legal tender," then we are reduced to arguing semantics, which is moot.

I was thinking that someone (perhaps me) needs to start a service called DollarValidation which is a repository of serial numbers of Andrew Jacksons and Ben Franklins that were used (by whose determination it is arbitrary) for nefarious purposes.
Law enforcement is free to share "known bad" public addresses with each other (such as all the DPR addresses) for their own purposes, we don't need to centralize this information and make it available to everyone.
In any event, law enforcement is *disincentivized* to taint their bitcoins as that would mean nobody would want them (since the knowledge about their source is public, according to this scheme), and then suddenly the value of some bitcoins would differ from the value of other bitcoins, destroying fungibility. Game over bitcoin.
Let's envision a future where bitcoins are used for child sex slavery (worst case scenario). Here's how I see law enforcement going down:
1) Raid a number of clients paying sex slavers. Collect their public keys.
2) Do a cluster analysis of where the money in those keys tends to go to. Find the common addresses. (This assumes that some significant percentage of these folks aren't using coin laundries 100% of the time. Which may or may not be the case.)
3) Raid the sex slaver. Collect public keys. See that some of them are the same ones found in (2) via cluster analysis. Evidence goes to court. BOOM, law is served.
It's basically *already easier* to enforce the law with bitcoin than it is now with fiat and good ol' bank accounts!
And since anyone who *actually* intends to do wrong with them can simply send them to a coin laundry (which also conveniently eliminates any tainting), it defeats the point of the whole endeavour.
Basically, law enforcement wouldn't change much. If anything it could get easier. Where warrants might have been required before, now we have an entire unencrypted global ledger that allows us to trace where the money goes. I mean, that's basically *law enforcement porn*. Let's not make this any easier than it already will be!

First of all, it cannot possibly go to $0, ever, unless the encryption is *completely* broken all at once, which is next to impossible, although I cannot explain it to you without going into excruciating technical detail. The worst that can happen is that the value (at least as measured in other currency) drops... temporarily. What happens then? People who accept Bitcoin price their things in... *more Bitcoins.*
In any event, you're actually arguing against Bitcoin as a *value store*, but that argument falls flat against Bitcoin as a *value transfer*. And it is an *extremely good* mechanism to do that. There is currently no faster way to send any amount of value, anywhere in the world, for nearly free, and in 10 minutes or less. All those institutions set up as expensive and time-consuming roadblocks between countries when you're just trying to move money around? Those are already *nuked*, they just don't realize it yet. It is only a matter of time. If the Internet gets to a country, then Bitcoin will be available in that country. Period. The clock is ticking, right now. Like a bomb. A good bomb... (hello, NSA! PS, I'm a USAF Vet! sigh.)
Those US dollars you have sitting in the bank at 1% interest are losing 4% of their value a year to inflation... Even though, numerically, the value is increasing.

Bitcoin is in a very Wild West-ish state right now. Those points of a new technology require quite a bit more personal responsibility. You can always just host your wallet with someone else and trust then. Coinbase keeps 90% of their bitcoins in cold storage for example.
I'm not a security guy, just a programmer, but did you read the article I posted here about the &gt;$5000 bitcoin heist which was due to a compromised random number generator? For my day to day bitcoin use I'll accept risk but for cold storage I am taking no chances.

EDIT: BONUS: [Some super simple Bash commandline functions to encrypt or decrypt a file using gpg.]( For OS X or Linux. Windows, you can probably make it work with some unix-on-windows hackery.

I think Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Not easily categorizable, because nothing like it has existed before. It's closest to gold, if gold were completely electronic, frictionless, weightless, and immaterial. Gold has been used as a currency in the past. Materiality is not a requirement of a currency, witness 95% of USD balances only exist as a database row in a computer somewhere.
If a small country's currency was both new and growing, people would be speculating on it, too. Otherwise [things like this would have never existed.](
Unfortunately, countries don't tend to grow (except in GDP, very slowly) once set up. Fortunately, things are free to grow on the Internet, which is everywhere and nowhere at the same time.
I've bought many things with Bitcoin, or should I say, I've traded many objects and services for Bitcoin. Does that make Bitcoin a currency at least in part? I'd say so.
Bitcoin (at least as a technology) is open-source, decentralized, secure, programmable, completely electronic, and resilient. These are supremely desirable characteristics on the Internet, where it was born and where it is designed to live. P2P protocols don't tend to go away. And its value (at least as measured in fiat) can't go to zero anyway unless 100% of the trade in it ceases.
The value people place on a Bitcoin, at least as measured in other neanderthal forge-able confiscatable poorly-centrally-managed currencies, is completely irrelevant, because the cat is already out of the bag. Pandora's Box has been opened, and no one can shut it anymore.

I predict it will pop but then surge to $500 before next April after some other country gets a hold of the utility of the idea (currently it's China). Might be India and remittances, could be Europe and frustration with their currencies, could be Brazil or Argentina or an abused African currency. All it will take is a few people allowing you to send bitcoins via text messages from any phone and boom, watch it grow.

If the dividends stayed at that level it would make sense. If they keep their percent of the total hashing power intact (by buying up more and more hardware), then they will continue to pay the same dividends at least until the next block halving.

Honestly, that would be catastrophic, and although that would have a very good effect on my bottom line, I think that is a long way off.
What we might see, after it becomes easy to exchange them via text messaging, is it taking over one of these vastly overinflated currencies from some smaller "3rd world" countries which have a fairly good cellphone penetration. Remember that there are many people in the world who have cellphones but no computer.
You can actually already do this today, it's just that the knowledge that this is possible has not been distributed enough yet:
When people realize they have this option instead of keeping their money in a currency with an abusive inflation rate (greater than 10%/year, for example), I think the choice will become pretty clear.
Want to help me by googling how many currencies have an inflation above 10%/yr? I know Argentina and Zimbabwe off the top of my head.

There's a few areas of knowledge in the BTC world and you don't have to master all of them, fyi:
1) How bitcoins come into existence (aka "mining")
2) Where they get their value from
3) How to spend BTC
4) What a "wallet" is (ultimately it's just a pair of long numbers which only connect to each other in 1 direction, and you must therefore keep 1 of the numbers secret, it's the "private key")
I'd start with 4 and work your way up to 1.

There is no rocket science here (for actual use). Scan a QR code, pay, done.
If you want to be completely impervious to hacking, back up your "savings" private key to paper (hopefully behind a password you won't forget) and store it in a safe deposit box and delete the copy on any computer or system. Send most of your money there. Then, only give any other agency the corresponding public key (such as a "Watch Only" wallet at blockchain.info). When you want to move funds out of it, retrieve the private key, import the key into a wallet, spend it, delete the private key from the wallet.
Or split up the key into pieces using [SSSS]( You can set it up so that you only need, say, 3 out of 4 keys to reconstruct the original private key. Give the pieces to trusted folks. Then, if you die, they can combine their bits to get at your money.
Or invent an un-guessable but not-easy-for-you-to-forget [brainwallet]( Then there is no way for anyone to even know you have the key to untold worth in your head.
This stuff is fundamentally no different than password-protecting your online bank account. If someone knows your login there, they can spend your money there too.
Granted, it's new so it's rough around the edges, and will get easier. The tools I listed above are pretty nerdy-looking (read: a UI designer has not had their say yet... but that's coming). Yet they are based on fundamentally sound concepts.

On April 1 I bought 90 BTC at MtGox and sent them to a new Blockchain wallet I created just for that transaction, using the Chrome browser plugin. (Did you use that too?)
A few days later I thought my balance looked a little low and realized that that one wallet was just GONE!
I panicked at first but then on a whim I went to their cloud-hosted wallet backups (even if you don't have them email you your wallet backup, they still host it!) and I imported the last wallet backup from April 1 AND THAT WALLET APPEARED AGAIN. THANK GOD.

I don't think it's fair to compare apples and oranges.
Apple is EXTREMELY dear to my heart. Apple got me excited about computers in 1984, when I thought I wanted to be a doctor when I was 12. Now I am a rock-star programmer. I really don't think you're even able to appreciate what Apple has done for the world, frankly. You are probably young and missed out on so much. There would be no Windows without Apple leading the way in ease-of-use and accessibility, for example. Nor much of what is considered common now in the computer world such as "plug and play" (or as windows was for a long time, "plug and pray") and a million other little details you take for granted.
And programming is what got me into Bitcoin. A year ago, before it was cool.
And yes, BTC is a weapon against oppressive governments who use currency control to keep their people controlled, and that is a much larger market of people than "people who can afford to appreciate Apple devices", I will give you that.
Just please do not scapegoat Apple to illustrate a Bitcoin point. It is not fair to either.

It's a histogram of orders by price. The left side is buy orders. The right side is sell orders. Where they meet in the middle is the current market price.
As you can see, there are a lot more people willing to buy if the price drops (keeping the price from dropping too far) than are willing to sell if the price rises (keeping the price rising).
This configuration normally indicates that the price will continue to rise.

I think solutions like [TrustedCoin]( could help with this. They use a 2 of 3 scheme (probably Shamir's), they keep one, and you keep one and store a third way the hell offsite somewhere that is difficult to get to (in case trustedcoin goes down or is compromised). You can require a delay before your private key is released.
They could easily add a stealth feature where if you reveal a different key shard than the one you normally would, it secretly triggers law enforcement action.

It seems that you are subject to the same imperviousness, since you have already formed your opinion and declared your inability to change it?
And I'm a HUGE open source fan. I'd link my Github profile but it would reveal my identity (it is very busy). And I use Macs because they stay out of my way and every single person at every startup I've been at in the past 5 years uses them to develop on because they are perfect web development machines.
I consider Apple's "walled garden" a necessary evil for security reasons. Jobs originally wasn't even going to *allow* apps for this very reason.


iOS apps? Dude there are a million ways to make an app on OS X that are not "iOS apps" and are far more perfect avenues to learn programming if you're a kid. PHP, Ruby, and Python are included free with every copy of OS X, for example. The OS X dev tools are *free*.
If you're an adult and can't cough up $200 for something you care about... then maybe your grand idea isn't all it's cracked up to be.


Seeing as I got into Apples LOOOOONNNNNNGGG before it was remotely "cool" (I'm 41 and have seen it all... Do you even fucking *fathom* how *uncool, anything* related to computers was in the 80's?), this argument is bullshit.

I was that kid. I had ideas and they all got nixed by my parents. I saw things happening, big future things, and they all got nixed by my parents. I had to fight to be in a computer class before the internet existed because it was so new that they had to have the class overlap with more "traditional" classes and that meant I would miss those, and my parents protested. I had to fight to spend time indoors programming for fun during the summer because my parents thought it was healthier to be outside swimming and biking (ok, honestly, they had a point there, but they pressed it *really hard*. I still love swimming and biking, but being self-motivated to program as a teenager is pretty fucking priceless these days).
In the 80's when I was a teen, if you were into computers, you were a tool, period. There was no cool aura whatsoever. I didn't realize until much later, how many balls it took to simply not give a shit what people thought or what was cool. I listened to uncool 1990-era techno on my fat-ass Walkman and went to uncool computer classes (literally, I was 1 of just 2 people in this one class... and the other person was a girl... who is now a doctor lol) and wore uncool clothes and drove a 1979 Oldsmobile Delta 88 they nicknamed "Das Boot" (a nod to me being German).
Now I'm almost 41, listen to dubstep (yeah, I know... but I liked it before it was cool and then hated)/ambient/trance/alternative, i'm a web developer, I go to concerts, [I was on Reddit years before it became popular]( (that's a link to my original account and its badges), I'm finally successful...

Life seems to have rewarded me *extremely* for ignoring pay as a primary motivation. BTC looked "interesting and completely new" to me 1.5 years ago, so I tossed 30 grand at it or so (cashing out 2 401k's, in fact, AND while I was unemployed, although I had just received a job offer... I'm crazy like that).

**3) money without intrinsic value.**

Well, first of all, I can send and receive BTC just fine with the Blockchain app- the way it is done is that the actual sending and receiving is done with an embedded Webkit browser- and apple can't exactly block that as the same can be done via the website.
Now, yes, Apple has [some sort of project going on]( where they might find BTC a conflict of interest, but again, I am able to send and receive BTC just fine [with the app]( (They added some sort of sneaky functionality in that unlocks the ability after you download it and log in, I think?)

Maybe you should exact some karmic revenge and invest in some? :)
Investing in freedom was never a mistake...
I am in favor of "evidence-based legislation" which basically means, look at the actual facts and statistics untainted by a common idea of "morals" or what have you and make laws based on that. If they had done that to begin with then marijuana would have never been made illegal. We're also missing out on a bunch of tax income from it. Let anyone marry whomever they want and buy whatever they want as long as nobody is getting hurt, etc. A libertarian-esque worldview I guess.

Tesla just announced they will be paying off ALL their government loans. So that's a start.


I'd beware of putting "scientific study" in quotes. The scientists I know don't make a lot of money and do it because they love it. They do it because to discover a truth that nobody on the planet has known before is the most rewarding thing in the world for them, far greater than mere pay increases. Unfortunately, when one's worldview is driven by money, it is difficult to see how someone else's might not be. Some people have actual interests in things, and principles and whatnot. Some people want to see the world end up in a better place long-term, than in a worse place if as a side effect they get richer.


Possibly, but it is difficult to prove this which leads to speculation.


Of course there would be, that's not true. Crime is a problem, resolving political conflicts is a problem, education is a problem, pollution is a problem, overfishing the oceans is a problem, North Korea is a problem, the increasing disparity between the so-called "classes" is a problem. These are not going away anytime soon, and they require government. Not to mention shared services like the police, FD, traffic system, power system, etc. etc.


This has to go. The evidence *already exists* that this is a failure and that management and taxation is better than prosecution. It worked in Portugal. The evidence just needs to sink in. It may take a generation...


The most dangerous thing here is that the definition of [terrorism]( is so blurry: *The word "terrorism" is politically and emotionally charged,[5] and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of “terrorism”. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as "terror" by opponents of the state).*


Is a real problem. Food is cheap because corners are cut and health problems result. Also [fructose is apparently partly to blame](


[Is also real, and 99% of scientists say it's real, but people are welcome to stick their heads in the sand, to the detriment of all of us.](


Actually, time and again I've seen predictions fail. I've seen people scoff at the personal computer, the Internet, the iPod, the Web, email, and more, all when these were still new. There's a pattern here, and that there's a raw *un*predictability going on. Revolutionary change does occur.


Are you a climate scientist? If not, can you please cite *objective* links to sources. Hint: National Review is not objective.


This is actually interesting. But this was an attempt to find a business/capitalist solution to this problem instead of a forceful one.


Most of the mess was due to poor risk assessment. Risks were taken on risks which were taken on risks and the dominoes finally fell at some point. Which is why banks are so risk-averse now, which is why business is stagnant.


Why do you keep using quotes as if these things are fake? Are you so jaded that you won't believe that some people *do* want to change things for the better? (I am one of those people.)


Steve Jobs was famous for this... "So here's my new iMac design..." "We can't fit a logic board in there. The shape is impossible to work with." "Yes you can. I know you can. Do the impossible." (They ended up pulling it off.)
This is more a problem with engineers being confident in themselves :)

Hey man. I'm just as vehement at fighting ignorance as you are. Except that you're all angry at, well, everyone (as proxy to OP I guess) when you should just get (not angry, but logical) at OP. When you don't react neutrally and factually to ignorance, you change the conversation from one of determining the truth to one of "who is more emotional".
For example, straight from the Ripple site "For Developers" section:

You shall have yours one day. Always take EDUCATED/INFORMED risks.

Since those were erected to prevent grossly (or at least "arguably") "unfair" business practices in that industry such as insider trading, I'd argue they're still necessary there. ::dodges libertarians::
We *don't yet know* what's necessary in the Bitcoin space. That's the beauty, the horror and the drama of the Wild West or "greenfield project" as us IT guys call it. This is also where most of the opportunity (and risk) lies.
It's currently a game with few rules. Some will win and some will lose, and more rules may get added eventually. Play smart, play safe. Don't ever assume too little risk and know that there might be MANY types of players at this game... such as guys who have been staring at price charts like this their entire lives who *longed* to exercise their hard-earned knowledge on a completely unregulated security.
Consider this: Say I had a Bitcoin position, and found a serious flaw. Where is my incentive to report it? To whom would I report it to? Would I sell my BTC, report it to the news, and then buy up the newly-underpriced BTC stock out there? Or would I report it to the Bitcoin Foundation? Or someone else? Or say nothing and wait for the right opportunity? Would I collude with others who have found other flaws and we unleash all our knowledge at once to take advantage of the price dip?

Just today on there was a tech guy who advises the German government on technology matters and they asked him to present on Bitcoin. They were *hostile* towards it, but I tried to remind him that a government concerned about tax collection (as much as some here loathe the idea) could simply require businesses that accept payment in BTC that wanted to stay legit to report the public keys they received BTC via, since that was all public information and impossible to forge.
Where Germany goes, the EU follows, and then the US.

Where individuals fail, the community can succeed. And you and I and that guy (for better or for worse) represent this technology, to some degree, to others and to ourselves, as early adopters. Especially while the community is still quite small. So if someone gets drop-kicked by someone else who... chose poorly, you step up, for the good of the community as well as perception. People don't realize that the only thing making BTC tick are the people that care about it and that is a precious thing at this stage.

If I owned a store which traded your used clothing for food stamps (in either direction) except that if you wanted food stamps for clothing, you'd have to wait 6 months to get the food stamps, then people would be more likely to use my store to trade food stamps for used clothing instead of the other way around, thereby inflating the price of the used clothing in food stamps, due to supply and demand (more used clothing gets bought than gets sold which raises the price).

At least he's honest.)
The thing is, the nerds always win in the end. The jocks are loud and threatening and big and brash and win early on, but the nerds are subversive and thoughtful and calculating and subtle and play the long game by design, without even realizing it. Long after the jock earns his beer gut and bald spot and consumer BMW trophies and Stepford wife, the nerd is lifehacking and fittit'ing and juggling offers from both jobs and the opposite sex and making cool shit and not giving a shit about material things except when they might change the world like Bitcoin.

"According to data from the Federal Reserve, we now have $2.1 trillion more floating around than we did four years ago. **If one is concerned about the value of the dollar, this is an important figure.** It isn’t the $15 trillion Paul mentioned, and it has just about nothing to do with the GAO report, but it is a real issue for anyone who cares about diluting the power of the dollar."
I'm going to edit my original links and stated facts to reflect this. Thanks for the correction. I wish you had begun with that instead of starting in with the name-calling. Because, believe it or not, I HATE spreading misinformation. :/ Like, I'm seething now. But I'm cool with that. I'd rather be (and am OK with being) temporarily wrong than permanently wrong.

Decentralized digital value-holding asset which is easy to exchange, incurs no fees, and shares properties with both cash and gold, but is completely electronic and encrypted, and requires no credit. The security of the asset is based on the secrecy of its corresponding private key(s), which is a long string of alphanumeric digits, and its value is not backed by any authority or "gold standard", but is instead curiously free-floating and traded on exchanges for fiat currency. Its value and use has been rising.

You have to be real careful with brainwallets. The brainwallet is *all that is necessary to get your money*. No other passwords matter. The existence of blockchain.info does not matter. The hash of your brainwallet phrase IS the private key *for your wallet on the bitcoin network itself*, basically. This is why your brainwallet sucked, frankly. AT MINIMUM you should NEVER use a grammatically-correct sentence much less one which is a song name. If you REALLY wanted to use that song name, you could at least have replaced some letters with numbers or changed capitalization or repeated letters or whatever you feel you could have remembered (thus adding more "entropy" or randomness), but even that is weak.
Brainwallets are a dangerous drop in entropy (randomness; i.e., it makes them WAY easier to predict/precompute) unless you know what the heck you are doing. Btcrobinhood did you a HUGE favor.
Assume there are people out there "mining" brainwallets. This is actually why "mining" exists, by the way- it ensures that it is almost always more profitable to mine "by the rules" than by trying to hack wallets by doing things like predicting brainwallets (easy) or guessing completely random private keys (very hard).

I don't know why this is still necessary to say. My Blockchain.info iOS wallet app works fine, and has always worked fine, and I have been continuing to upgrade it. And by "works fine" I mean I can send and receive BTC with it, scan QR codes etc.
I have tried to Google why this is so, to no avail. Curiously, my app review on the iTunes Store (which said the send/receive worked) never actually posted publicly, but I know it's still in the system because when I try to review it again, it pulls up the existing review...
I believe [the Blockchain.info iOS app website]( is either out-of-date, or they have indeed "snuck in" the send/receive payments functionality somehow.
(That would be not very hard to implement; 1) check to see how old the associated Blockchain.info account is, 2) if it's older than ban date, enable the send/receive functionality via embedded web app. Apple can't exactly get away with banning web apps or URL's, so the only real functionality of the app that needs to be written in Objective C is the QR code scanning bit (and then that information can simply be passed to the web app).)
If this is in fact a real situation and it continues, I might take it upon myself to try to contact someone at Apple. I would agree that there should be no (overt or latent) hostility there, though, even if Apple has some sort of payments project in their skunkworks. [And they most certainly do.](

I guess I meant, where's your unit test suite in general? In Ruby, if I write a one-off class to do something, I write an inline test underneath it (which only runs when the file itself is run and not when the file is included by another file, hence the "if \_\_FILE\_\_==$PROGRAM_NAME" syntax in the following code). Here's some of my recent gists as an example, I'm sure that in python it wouldn't be hard to do something similar:
[A Hash that will raise if you try to reassign the same key](
[Teaching Ruby how to understand Roman numerals](
[Teach String to return nil unless there's a valid number](

I do not understand this point of view. This was an extremely risky investment and hindsight is 20/20. It is easy to look back and go "sure, *of course* this whole thing was in the bag from the get-go" but the fact is that the way markets work is directly related to the perceived risk... which means that if you are able to see less risk than others do (by understanding it better, perhaps), there is potentially a profit making opportunity. Arguably deserved, because the risk was real *at the time*. Risk is only nil *in hindsight* (it's a known cognitive bias), and you need early adopters/"true believers" to push *anything* into a valuable reality for "the masses."
"Earning" wealth the "old fashioned" way, by working for The Man, only makes 1 person rich- The Man. Every time The Man pays you a dollar, he's actually earned $2 off of you... but since he is assuming risk, it's considered a fair game. The only legit way for any person anywhere to get wealthy is 1) real estate, and 2) risky but brand new ideas, but more generally 3) take more calculated risks and *throw your weight behind them.*
Google "Paul Graham". That guy (aside from being smart) threw his entire self into the startup industry, first at his own (where he worked *fucking hard*) and then at an incubator. He's now worth about $500 million or so.
Here's another example- Helium is about to become super rare and expensive, and people are *not* stockpiling helium. Instead, people are still filling birthday balloons with this artificially-cheap yet actually super expensive gas that is extremely useful to the technology industry. Go ahead and Google it, and see how quickly you will realize that most people are dumb blind sheep who do not fathom things happening right around them nor the future implications of their actions. They care more about the next episode of their favorite show or who Miley Cyrus is fucking, than the inflation rate of their own currency or the implications of climate change or the rapidly dwindling middle class.
You know what's unfair? The fact that you have to be an Accredited Investor to invest in startup stock. You know what the requirement of that is? You have to have a net worth of a million fucking dollars. You know what the requirement is for you to invest in Bitcoins? *Nothing,* that's what. Do you know who controls Bitcoins, who is the Fed of bitcoins? *Nobody,* that's who. Do you know who can reduce the value of your "stock" by issuing more (which happens ALL THE TIME in startups)? *Nobody,* that's who.
Now explain to me again how any wealth Bitcoin is generating for some folks is unfair.

You are correct. That doesn't mean you will have a good experience, because you won't. XP blows.

Since I have a Windows 7 gaming machine at home as well as some Linux virtual machines, I consider myself having enough information to form this conclusion from. I was actually COMPLETELY excited about switching most of my computer use to [elementaryOS]( which is a Linux distro lately...

"My computer was obviously hacked as I did not send those coins."
That is what "plausible deniability" means, literally. You are denying it, and it's plausible.
Leave some false attack vector traces in your Apache logs or whatever. Basically, to make this work you'd need to "stupidly" put your computer in the DMZ of your router, leaving it out like a honeypot and plausibly hackable. Maybe you'd leave it in a brainwallet with a semi-easily-guessable phrase or a poor password on your encrypted wallet.dat. I guess that exposes you to the real risk of it actually getting stolen though. It's a fine line you tread as a plausible denier. I guess you could always say you changed the password to a more secure one after the coins were "stolen".

I'm a miner and I've actually made more money on the currency itself than on mining. (When I started, it was at $4.)
2) Perhaps early adopters have or will stand to gain. There is no other "organic" way to grow a new exchange medium, and most certainly many less-fair ways. It has to start somewhere and mining is fairly egalitarian. Flooz.com failed partly because nobody cared to adopt it (also because it was centralized and resulted in credit-card scams, aspects that Bitcoin is immune to). Taking advantage of natural self-interest turns out to be a great way to turn every user of something into a marketer, growing it organically.
3) This is not a mutually-exclusive success. Someone in Africa can create something, sell it anywhere in the world without having to have a bank account, without having to have credit, and without having to go through borders. And without paying fees. All they need is a phone, and perhaps an account at a secure website. I think that would be very valuable, to anyone trying to sell something to a greater audience.
4) I don't think it will replace all fiats. It may complement them nicely, however, as a kind of "global internet fiat".

What is missing from this quite plausible explanation is that it is possible, via a strange force called "will," to break out of the closed dopamine-reward cycle. The lack of consideration of will seems to indicate that there are only permanently-entrapping reward systems. Now of course, repeated stimulation can lead to saturation/boredom in which case it is easier to break out of the cycle but this then assumes that there is no one who, once hooked, can immediately and willfully break out of the cycle into a behavior that is back in line with what an outside observer would call "more optimal". Yet this does in fact happen.

The coup de grace would be the day Amazon accepts it as a form of payment. At that point, in all likelihood there will be new exchanges, there will be automated arbitrage systems between exchanges, there will be more guidance from regulatory bodies, and the price of each bitcoin will be (probably) at least $500. I'm betting in around 5 years or so. Possibly sooner, technology moves quickly.
People fear Bitcoin because its value is "based on nothing", but [based on this analysis by an economist that has a lot of math]( the lowest price a bitcoin can possibly sell for is about $50, and that is due to the fact that it is already carrying a trade volume. And as that volume rises, that bottom will also rise.

That's why you turn on 2-factor authentication and don't let them hold your money for long.
@_date: 2013-02-27 22:13:03


What in the world are you talking about? Have you ever even used the blockchain address explorer and understand what's going on there? Given any public address that has been part of a transaction, you can trace the entire history of where its current (or past!) balance of BTC came from just by clicking backwards. A computer can calculate this in an instant and if any of those source addresses are "tainted" it can figure out what percent of the source address's BTC history has "tainted" addresses which contributed to it. If you "swap coins", and your friend had the tainted coins, all you've done is take his tainted coins and made them yours, by adding 1 additional transaction on top of the history. Any computer could still determine in an instant that you're holding onto "dirty money", and you can do this to vet his coins before you even accept them.
All you would need to make this work is either a centralized or some agreed-upon scheme to taint addresses that have taken part in a crime.
This is actually far easier to implement than it would be for cold hard cash, which has serial numbers but which nobody bothers to look up or input anywhere.
Simple example:
Address A receives 25 BTC from the network for mining and is clean.
It spends 10BTC to Address B and 15 to C.
The guy holding B is held up at gunpoint and his BTC are stolen from him, to address D. He reports address D to some authority or database of "tainted addresses".
The criminal buys drugs with the 10BTC from D and 10BTC (which is untainted) from another address and sends it to E. E now has 50% tainted BTC, but the guy holding E didn't bother or care to check.
Guy holding E now tries to buy a TV on a Bitcoin e-commerce site with 20BTC. The ecommerce site checks his source address using a service, which traces the money back in an instant, figures out it's 50% tainted, and refuses the transaction by sending the money back to the guy holding E. Guy holding E says WTF, I need to check the taintedness of the BTC I get in the future!

What charges per transaction? You mean the miner fee for sending bitcoins? You can set that to whatever you want, although to ensure it gets included into a block anytime soon, the small fee paid should be reasonable. I'm not sure what the tipbot does here, but I assume it's reasonable.

I was a huge Apple fan for many many years. I thought they built the coolest computers and devices ever and I could not shut up about it. I stuck it out through the good and the bad, and then Apple, finally, "won." I probably singlehandedly, just by talking about Apple and helping folks with Apples, helped them sell many thousands of dollars worth of devices over the course of 29 years. And I did it willingly, for free, and would do it again. Also, Macworld Expos (RIP) are still the greatest tech expos I've ever been to.
The point is, your best marketers are your fans, the people who love your product. As a company, you *literally cannot buy* that kind of loyalty.
Without a single firm backing Bitcoin and paying for marketing, they'll need all the promotion help they can get. And the idea is legit (I read the source code and the paper; I'm a programmer).

Look, here's the deal.
's heart is in the right place. NOBODY wants some child slaver in Thailand to make his business go a hell of a lot easier by switching his accounting to Bitcoins. That guy in Russia who's currently encrypting hundreds of Windows users' data to be held hostage unless they pay in Bitcoin, NOBODY wants his day to go easier. That we all (or almost all, darn you, hardcore libertarians) can agree on.
But *given enough thought*, creating a tainted coin database *is a flawed idea*. It's not the solution to the above problems. The solution to the above problems is good old fashioned law enforcement *combined with an already global and publicly traceable transaction database*. As I said in another comment, how much more "*law enforcement porn*" can you get? The only caveat is coin laundries, I think that might need to be considered separately.

It's a digital simulation of gold. It's based on cryptography, it's decentralized, it costs almost nothing to send it, it sends in seconds (worldwide), and if someone gets your private key (a long string of characters that would be impossible to guess in many lifetimes) they can spend your bitcoins, so you are responsible for keeping it a secret/secure.
Nobody can shut it down anymore without shutting down the Internet- the cat is basically out of the bag. The only way to hurt it would be to control more than 51% of the network, and that is possible but ridiculously improbable (and expensive) at this point.
It's super nerdy right now, but like most things in technology, it eventually gets way easier and safer to use, but if you wanted to treat it like a financial instrument instead of an easy way to pay for things internationally or while out and about, best to probably get in now.
Ways to buy into it include coinbase.com, Bitstamp and MtGox ...although the latter (the original way to buy some) is being outdone by the new guys on the block, and has run into difficulty with US regulators and banks.
You can also "mine" it to get some, but [that's really a whole 'nother topic]( and may or may not be profitable depending on what the "difficulty" is and how much you paid for your mining setup. (See? It's another topic.)

Hallo, was ist los? :)
Let's see how to sell this idea to the government of Germany so that they will feel less like trying to ban it (which will only increase its price in fiat, by the way).
1) They can require that a business have all its bitcoin income go through a certain public address (or at least, a group of addresses which are all reported to the government). It is possible to calculate how many bitcoins have gone through these addresses right at Blockchain.info (even if they end up elsewhere), and therefore, *they cannot cheat the government out of tax money* (well, unless they take bitcoin via another channel, but this is the same as cash and not reporting cash income is already illegal). In my opinion this is a HUGE sell for government, and would also promote Bitcoin. Was denkst Du? For example, [here is the Wikileaks bitcoin address and the amount that has gone through it is plainly visible.]( Incidentally, this also permits automated tax computation/billing... saving MUCH labor.
2) Until legislation specifically mentions Bitcoin or other decentralized cryptocurrencies, managing it can fall under bartered-goods tax law. For example [here is the US Government version of this law, how to report bartered income](
3) It is extremely difficult if not impossible to outlaw it at this point. I highly recommend a tactic such as (1).
4) Why did you not come to us first before you presented? This is a potentially crucial decision in the future of this system!! I am already sorry that I only saw this *six whole hours* after you posted!
5) Germany has been a technology leader for many years. Please emphasize that Bitcoin can be worked with and that they should take a leadership role.
6) It is possible that Bitcoin threatens national currencies, to some degree. It is also possible that national currencies need to be threatened... But when something better comes along, banning it never works. Figuring out how to work with it is always a much better idea.
Sincerely,

Literally, the ENTIRE rule is what I stated. It's an abbreviation for "it is", and that's it. There are no exceptions. If you're abbreviating "it is", then use "it's", otherwise use "its".

It can process 7 transactions a second. As far as I've most recently read (which I believe was yesterday), it's up to 1TPS, i.e., there were 86,400 transactions yesterday.
The 7TPS limit is an artificially imposed limit. They can raise it or remove it. How would a DDoS attack be done on a decentralized network? Pump a single node with more than 7 TPS? It would get quite expensive as those transactions wouldn't even be able to get into a block (by miners) unless a reasonable transaction fee is attached. Otherwise, I feel like this would have been attempted already LONG ago...

It's encrypted and decrypted client-side, via Javascript. As I said, there's only 2 means of entry at that point:
1) Server side compromise plus compromise of said javascript, which would likely be an extremely small window;
2) XSS attacks, which if you are using a modern browser and keep it updated are also very unlikely.
If you use 2FA then basically the malicious JS would have to wait until you enter that information in and then do its dirty deeds.
You can always use encrypted paper wallets (as you indicated) for most of your BTC and then just set those addresses to "watch only" on sites like Blockchain.

What if there were multiple Bitcoin networks? The code has the capability to add other named networks, just like Testnet. Adding 9 networks would tenfold increase the total possible TPS. They could all be traded for each other on the open market or could resolve transactions with each other in some fashion. Or the networks could be hidden in the protocol layer and to a user they would not be seen as separate. There would just be 10 separate blockchains and rings which would resolve with each other somehow
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:14:44


What the heck do you mean by "a fraction of the price"? The price you pay for it is its apparent worth, so "a fraction" doesn't mean anything in that context. If you want $100 in bitcoins, you get a half a bitcoin (approximately). You also haven't named "some other digital coin". BTC has a large margin ahead of everything else in addition to massive institutional VC investment in a number of startups. Anyone is welcome to throw some money at Litecoin, though... Not sure how they'd actually spend it however. (I imagine tools will eventually come along to take any combination of cryptocurrencies, but we're nowhere near that yet.)
You do realize that if BTC takes just 5% of the global exchange in value, each BTC will HAVE TO be worth well over a grand, just to perform this function, and that assumes ALL BTC were in circulation?

All a legit business would have to do is report all their public keys that they received BTC through. Everything else is already in the blockchain, and you treat it like a cash business.
If anything, this would theoretically make it *easier* to collect taxes. For everyone concerned. The only requirement is that you have to reveal your public keys. (Up to you whether to reveal *all* of them, of course, but that's basically the same risk you take as if an all-cash business.)

[Not sure if you knew this but the Zerocoin dev(s) announced a few days ago that it would be released as a completely new altcoin and not as something "over and above" bitcoin.](
Therefore, nothing of this would be recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain. At all. It will be an entirely separate entity. Which means that tracking entry to and exit from it requires an exchange complying with AML. "On the street" ≠ "exchange", so I predict everyone will one day have a few darkcoins like Zerocoin, "for whatever."
And of course there will be AML-complying exchanges that will allow you to trade in darkcoins as speculation, but God forbid they see you buying a lot of darkcoins and "holding" for too long a time.
Zerocoin is going to be the coin that WILL incite actual government ire. Zerocoin is probably going to end up *the* most literal form of Pandora's Box in history.

This is a ridiculous line of reasoning. There is something called "the law" and it has been in operation in many civilized societies for thousands of years. Its purpose is to get to the bottom of exactly what you describe. An example of how The Law™ might work here is:
1) Person claims to have BTC stolen
2) At some point, someone's computer or device is confiscated which has a public key that happens to be the address where people claim to have had BTC stolen to
3) Game, set, match
You're basically claiming it's impossible to get to the bottom of it, i.e. figure out the truth, and that is fucking ridiculous. It's difficult, but not impossible.

When a Bitcoin transaction is broadcast, only the nearest nodes can even determine its IP address. They will pass it along to other nodes and those *won't* know the originating IP address. The rest of the information is already available in the blockchain.
The NSA is not God, and is not omniscient. They can't see where all transactions are coming from unless they literally bug *all internet routers everywhere* which is completely impractical.
They'd have to know your public keys (most or all of them) to determine anything else of any substance. Good luck with that.

If you don't have a highly paid security consultant or employee on staff AND don't have *extensive* unit testing/functional testing/integration testing of your site code and ALL its possible inputs AND have your code audited on a regular basis for potential red flags... You WILL go down, hard.
Hackers are clever motherfuckers. The first time I read about things like [gzip timing attacks]( (and I'm supposedly a pretty sharp guy), I realized "wow... shit just got real." It's not a joke.
Just warning you. I work for (a startup owned by a very large corporate company you've heard of) and we have internal code audits all the time, we run auditing tools that flag potential security holes all the time, we have an excellent programming team and we STILL constantly find holes. Programming these days seems to be as hard as making Swiss cheese without the holes.
All of this is, of course, very expensive.
FYI I'm in a Rails dev shop and we run [SimpleCov, reek, cane, flog]( and other tools all the time.
Also, as an adult American male, I can't see your domain name without thinking "rimjob". I'm very sorry. Google these things, next time, before you commit to them... I'm guessing you're not American.

I feel like the "no intrinsic value" argument is just a restated "insecurity" argument... In other words, the idea with a currency based on gold is that if everything (i.e. the government) goes to shit, SOMEone SOMEwhere will still accept it for its gold content. So you feel "more secure" in it (even though gold value is largely subjective, as evidenced by its wild swings).
Well here's the thing. If Bitcoin ended up being THE *global* currency and not just a *local* one, and a *local* government goes to shit... Wouldn't Bitcoin be completely unaffected, assuming most of the world at that point was pricing things in bitcoins and therefore still took them? Even if the whole world went to shit, people would still be able to use them as long as there was electricity and the Internet.
If the Internet went down, though, I think we'd have bigger problems...
I think this could end up complementing local currencies AND gold, and like Matonis says, is potentially part of any future healthy portfolio.

I see the problem. I believe you are correct. The blockchain currently can't store negative balances (but perhaps that is a functionality that can be enabled?)
Or perhaps the entire idea of fractional reserve banking is flawed... It depends on the idea that not everyone will ask for their money at once... So if there is sudden loss of faith in the dollar... Who is left holding the bag? That can't possibly happen with BTC.
But you could still owe someone BTC, in a secure accounting system that is off the blockchain.
This will probably happen eventually anyway, as not everyone is savvy enough yet to maintain a secure, backed up set of private keys. And yes, this implies trust.

From what I understand it will be a P2P network of IOU's based on the trust networks that are already out there between people.
So you can sort of use it to pay for things, too. So I still can't even fathom if it is a competitor to BTC or an adjunct... I imagine that since BTC is "trust-free" and Ripple is "trust-based" that there might just end up being an interesting synergy there... like if someone is too far out of your "trust network", you can still pay them in BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-06 22:27:12
I'm not buying the argument. The argument is basically that because a slippery slope is present, no line (law) should be drawn. I really hate lines (you have no idea, I have a longstanding "problem with authority" chip on my shoulder), but creating some sort of "sliding scale of offense" is impractical (unfortunately). This is exactly the same problem as statutory rape... clearly (ok, very debatably), a 13 year old consenting teen having relations with a 24 year old consenting adult is less than desirable, but without drawing a line somewhere you basically have to come up with some crazy equation that would probably end up looking a lot like the (half your age + 7) rule and would be very hard to enforce.
(I have a *major* pet peeve with victimless crimes. I know I'm probably karma-whoring by saying that *here,* but I just thought I'd mention.)
Along the same lines, a person driving completely shitfaced drunk is very liable to kill someone, so just because a person who just had 1 beer at the bar and is driving home is OK doesn't automatically mean that a person who had 20 beers and then drove home should therefore be OK.
Or look at speed limits. A person who is 25 years old and has better than 20/20 vision and has been raised on action video games *probably* can handle driving much faster pretty safely... and should theoretically be OK... but this becomes problematic to enforce. You pull people over, they show you their "civilian racer qualification" card which qualifies them (based on age and annual testing) to safely travel at 84MPH instead of the 79MPH he got pulled over for in a "65MPH" speed zone, and he'd have to be let go.
The problem is that life is a series of gray areas, but enforcement works best with clear lines. And without any enforcement, you'd have anarchy.

Keylogger while you type your master LastPass password- Owned.
I do see that LastPass does have a 2 factor auth YubiKey option available (possibly for pay). That would be quite a bit more secure, but if you lose the key you're back to square 1 again. Then you have to reset all your passwords, and they all email you "click here to reset your password" links, and the keylogger from earlier has already gotten your email account password... Etc.


Well, they're quite popular, and a simple filesystem search (remember that your computer got compromised above?) would tell them that you have LastPass...

It's so fucking buy time now. Mark my words.
You buy when there's "blood in the streets," not at the peak of mania.
The fundamentals of this tech are solid and it just got fairly positively received in 2 separate hearings. All it takes now is a single big player (Starbucks etc.) to accept it and it's rollercoaster time again.
I'd buy 50 but Coinbase JUST changed their policy to only buy at the FUTURE value in 4 days AND are already at their limit for the day. Lame. (EDIT: they changed it back. That didn't last long!)
If you bought at the *peak* in April you'd still have double your money now. In 7 months.
DISCLAIMER: I do own quite a few Bitcoins, but I'm a true believer in it. (sigh, it's hard for me to be a true believer in pretty much anything, but I'm a programmer and I feel BTC is legit and COULD answer a worldwide need for a completely fluid non-state-controlled currency)

Agreed with all of that except for the testing bit.
Which is great, because all that means is that _why is not a god, just a beautiful human. :)
Tests have allowed me to basically run with scissors when it comes to refactoring my own code (which is inevitable). Well written tests will test all the standard use cases at minimum and perhaps a handful of corner cases. I've found that even a handful of assertions on some code leads to huge wins in terms of "wow, that failure would have been shitty to debug if it wasn't covered." Lastly, it allows me to go home at the end of the day knowing that I won't be called at 2am because I broke some critical piece I forgot to check manually via "F5 debugging".

And I solved a serious [medical problem that had unknowingly been robbing me of much of my ability to think]( just a year and a half ago or so, which I had probably suffered from for 20+ years (it was classified as "severe" and I was always a heavy snorer), possibly my entire life. (You can't imagine what a mindfuck that is, btw.) And I feel like my IQ jumped up about 30+ points after that (and my weight dropped 35 lbs and rising, but I digress).
My girlfriend is acting extremely intimidated to the point that we may break up (basically, she is looking for more and more reassurances that we are not in jeopardy, which is turning me off, and which is kind of like when you're roller-skating and fall because you keep looking at the ground or realizing "holy shit I'm not falling!", or when you play poker and lose because you keep looking at your cards and people read that as weakness, etc.). That is the only downside. Oh and also, people at work are intimidated, I can tell. But the funny thing is that when work is intimidated, they give you raises...
So basically, look the fuck out, here I come. Sort of like a real-life "Limitless." :)

There is a thread on now from some guy who is apparently advising the German government on how to treat BTC and apparently the current opinion is somewhat hostile towards it. I am trying to promote the idea of legitimate use of BTC by businesses by reminding people that all the government has to do is require BTC income to be sent through publicly-reported public addresses and the BTC income through them is always easily computable and verifiable. This is actually a win-win all around.

Been running 2 FPGA minirigs from them since last July. I was one of the first preorders when nobody had heard of them back in Feb of last year. They finally did ship in July and they have been putting out a combined hashrate of 49 gigahash for months now. They're generating around 4BTC/day and have paid for themselves twice over.
So they actually did ship something already, it's just that you had to be there and you had to see it and you had to have the money ready (I cashed out TWO 401k's to pay for em, huge risk, just paid the penalty for that actually) and it was long before the other angry chumps heard of it. Then they stopped shipping FPGA tech because ASIC was around the corner (haha, so we all thought) and I guess, engineering is hard.

Consider moving your bitcoins to a blockchain.info/wallet wallet.

Banks are not stopping business with these people because they don't like Bitcoin, by the way. Banks have risk compliance policies (especially after the recent problems) and if a relatively new customer starts moving a buttload of cash around, it will run afoul of these policies regardless of any actual guilt. They are literally just trying to cover their asses.
It might be possible to stave off some of this by 1) working with multiple banks instead of just one 2) slowly scaling up your business until you are more trusted 3) coming up with a clever way to swap BTC and fiat without relying on banks :O

I did make a large investment, and I will be in the first ASIC rig miner batch as I preordered upgrades immediately on announcement based on their successful delivery of their FPGA units (which I had also preordered early and which I admit was very risky at the time but which has been financially successful), exactly because of the reason you cited (early entrants get first dibs on lower difficulties).
I don't think ASIC will be superseded by anything else for some time, so I do think that ASIC will be profitable for most eventually, just after a much longer timeframe. My two FPGA miner rigs are still making about $100 a day in BTC and they've paid for themselves as I got in at the preorder price. That is even with someone else hosting the rigs and paying for that. (Taxes sure will be fun to figure out, though. Pretty sure I can deduct the investment as a computer service expense)
I agree it's all a grand experiment with some interesting variables that may not benefit everyone equally, though.
With the ouster of bASIC I wonder how that will affect BFL if at all. My bet is end of Feb delivery.

There is no real way to shut down bitcoin, just like there is no real way to shut down the Internet (in fact, the Internet was designed by DARPA specifically to be resilient to routers going down in the event of a nuclear war- Ironic, isn't it?). It doesn't have to run on the same ports, and all its traffic is encrypted. That is the whole point of "decentralized". Discrediting it has already been tried- for chrissakes its main use at this time is *still* at an underground illegal-wares trading site, if FOX News hasn't been all over this already then discrediting will take a lot of work. Forbidding its use? Everyone knows that will only make the price of it skyrocket, and I think that ANY government would benefit more by figuring out how to tax it (such as by requiring that public keys be reported to the right agency).


You're not really specific about how this "attack" would look. First of all, right now we only have ONE primary exchange, and in a year we will probably have TEN. Good luck attacking them all. Not to mention other ways of transacting such as localbitcoins.com etc.
Have you noticed that torrenting is still viable? The Pirate Bay website is still up? Gnutella or what have you is still in operation? The TOR network is alive and well? These things have existed for years now. What is the one thing in common with all of these? They are decentralized, encrypted and do not have single points of failure.

That's only worrisome if your debt is priced in the deflating currency.
I think Bitcoin is going to end up being "the currency in between, over and above, and around all other currencies" and not anyone's primary currency. No state would give up their currency control, put it that way, but the existence/future prevalence of bitcoin would force them to stay honest and not debase the currency or people will flee to bitcoin.
The crazy thing is that we do not have an absolute scale of value. We only have approximate measures which are numbered relative to all *other* measures. You say you earn $20/hr cashiering... Well, what is that "dollar" *really* worth? Well, you can in this case pin it to the amount of work that 3 minutes of cashiering would entail. I guess we could base a theoretical absolute value behind the denominational value of a currency on an underlying labor cost, though... like the bitcoin work function, for example? :)

All new technologies have too much complexity.

When the Internet was new, there were no web browsers yet and you needed to type FTP commands to get files.
When the WWW was new, you had to dial out via PPP on a modem.
When computers were new, there was no GUI- you either learned a bunch of typed commands or you were SOL.
It will get worked out eventually.
And by then it will probably be at least $500/btc.

I agree that a real-world-valuable proof-of-work would be preferable to a purely mathematical proof of work.
The other consideration around proof of work is that the current algorithm is almost identical to a brute-forcing algorithm, which means that anyone who *actually* tries to brute-force the network would get more bitcoins over time by just mining (it incentivizes mining over brute-forcing). This adds security to the network because any newly discovered attack on the cryptographic hashes used would be applicable to mining too.
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:45:52
I would like to remind people that the point of mining is to provide a counterincentive to just this sort of energy expenditure (brute forcing) but it requires that your brainwallet have some minimum level of pure randomness.

First off, welcome.
And yes, you are right. And people are working on that, as I type. Programming is hard, though. Programming around a cryptographically secure, decentralized transaction system in a hack-proof, scalable way, a little harder. But feasible. (I am a fairly accomplished web developer, and am wondering if I should quit my job and start working in this space instead.)
Anyway, I think a lot of people realize that these things will come eventually and are throwing money at it due to the potential, the fact that a bunch of startups just got real VC money put into them, etc.
There's a lot of variables all going on at once, some of which have never occurred together before, which has the property of making Bitcoin extremely interesting, at the very least. I personally think this is one of the most exciting things going on in the world right now and that history will show that, but then again I'm a tech guy who has always loved this sort of thing, those spots where cutting-edge tech meets "real life"... and what is realer than the exchange of value?
I do think the current price is inflated, though, so beware (/opinion), only because the growth in value is far outpacing the growth in bitcoin network (although it is growing steadily too). The trading systems are completely unregulated, which if I was a finance guy would be like taking a time machine back to the Wild West and wanting to fashion myself into a Rockefeller, I should think. There is also quite a bit of, hrmm how can I put this, "dumb money" in this right now, people who just want a piece of the action... An element of every bubble ever... which is fine, honestly, but the thing that will make or break this are the people who are going to ride out these cycles as this market grows.
Feel free to ask me any questions and I'll answer to the best of my ability (when I can... I work at startups... again, bitcoin has this weird startup vibe to it... ;) )

*Which, ironically, probably allowed him to give Bitcoin a shot in the first place.* This is not exactly a conventional investment...
But also, he said he had been day trading/mining BTC for over a year now and was now "fatigued" (read: burned out) by it. I could totally understand not wanting to worry about the price in USD anymore.

Since BTC has *zero* regulation (as opposed to silver in the above instance), nobody can stop someone from applying a significant amount of leverage to the market in order to manipulate the price.
I know most of us crypto/programmer types are of the google Do No Evil™ sort, but not everyone is. The Gordon Gekko of Bitcoin is out there.

If you use a brainwallet, the backup is *inside your head*. Then, even if you literally delete ALL your bitcoin files, you can get back to them later as long as you remember your brainwallet passphrase.

1) Do that, buy BTC there
2) Tell them to send your BTC to a wallet address
3) Send those funds from that address through a mixing ::cough:: laundering ::cough:: service like Blockchain.info's mixing service (costs some percentage)

So basically, it's clear they either have no test suite or a shitty test suite if they have constant regressions after each feature release. So they are effectively using users and real money as their testers.
And if someone somehow figures out your 12 words, they instantly know not just some but ALL your private keys, now and forever! Heck they could just sit on that knowledge and not act on it until 5 years from now when Bitcoin is going for $5000 a pop! That sounds totally awesome.

Note that you can easily pay taxes by reporting your public keys. Ironically this would make it *incredibly easier* to pay taxes.

We would probably be in agreement that solar and wind (and hydro and geothermal) are highly preferable to pretty much any other source of power. I'm actually talking to a few people right now about starting a renewable energy farm.
But given the choice between coal and nuclear, the clear choice is still nuclear. Did you know that a coal plant puts out more nuclear waste than a nuclear plant?
I worry about the time when we finally figure out fusion power and nobody will go with it because it's "nuclear".

Use [Shamir's Secret Sharing Service]( to split the private key into pieces, say, 5 pieces. Make it so only 4 are required to reconstruct the private key. Then lock those pieces away separately. Send to the public address at will.
You can always get the private address back as long as 4 of the 5 locations are retrievable (SSSS lets you configure this).

It doesn't matter. Is gold a currency? Some people would take gold as payment, because they know it holds value. Can I send gold over the Internet, instantly, anywhere in the world, for free? No? Then BTC wins. BTC isn't shiny, though. Gold does win at obvious physical shininess. BTC is shiny to me, but for entirely different attributes.


Bad example. A run on potato farming would completely inflate the currency. You can't create more total BTC per unit time, no matter what (assuming difficulty catches up).

You can maintain a bitcoin balance in a computer that is separate from the blockchain. This is no different than what banks currently do with regards to dollars. It won't get you *direct* access to the bitcoins, but it's an amount they would owe you if you asked for it.

It is a "thing that holds or represents value."
I can pay you in Apple stock. That doesn't mean Apple stock is a currency. It holds value, but it fluctuates all over the place, so it's not a stable hold of value. Which makes it a speculative instrument, and not a currency. I'm sure I could convince a lot of people to accept Apple stock as payment (probably way more people than would accept Bitcoin, for example), even if it's a hassle, but that still doesn't make it a currency.
And so neither is Bitcoin, and therein lies the rub. I don't know exactly what a currency *is*, but I do know that something which, in 1 unit of it, represents $260 US dollars in April and $70 in June and $90 in July is no such thing. Not yet, anyway.
Along these lines, I could argue that Argentina's 20% inflation "currency" is also no such thing, and yes I would in fact argue that. A "currency" with a 20% inflation rate is no longer a currency; it is a sinking ship that you must get off ASAP.

Blockchain.info/wallet is IMHO the safest free place right now.
Or the Bitcoin-QT wallet app. With backups. Not without.
Blockchain automatically emails you backups of your wallet (encrypted) whenever it changes. It has already saved my ass from losing 90BTC... Long story, but good feature!
And they sign all transactions locally in your browser before they're sent, so they cannot tamper with your Bitcoins.
Unless they're hacked, that is. But then, only during the window that it hasn't been discovered, and only if you don't use the Chrome plug-in.

Oh and also, you have to have a thick skin. When I started going apeshit about Bitcoin in Jan. 2012, people surely thought I was a little insane. I tried to explain it to folks. My brother in law said "I can't put money in something I don't understand"... his loss. My IT coworkers, I managed to get quite a few of them involved, but none of them got as involved as I got. It's been the talk of the office lately. My bosses have been skeptical all along and yet, in the past year... I wouldn't be surprised if I made more money than anyone in my damn company.

I'm reading  algorithm.


No, no it is not. It requires trust. *Depending on trust is bad.* Read the book "The Evolution of Cooperation" by Robert Axelrod. There is an incentive to defect and not cooperate if there is no need for future contact... 51% of validators could conspire via darknet and change the ledger to give themselves the Ripple of the 49%. Or perhaps do something a lot more subtle... Plus, how do these other validators trust each other, anyway? Just past experience that they don't "lie" (i.e., disagree with the rest of the network)? That too is unreliable. All it takes is a single, gigantic, lie, to tip the scales. How does the rest of the network know that the information it was relayed is "the truth"?
This is really suspicious.
There is a very, very good reason why "proof of work" algorithms exist.

2) Lo and behold, they in fact did finally ship FPGA miners, and they worked well AND within the specs they were pushing. This alone deserves a lot of credit and should dispel 90% of the bullshit hating going on about them right now.
3) I have spoken to Josh as well as the CEO of BFL (Sonny) on many occasions over email (back in June, before the FPGA rigs I had preordered shipped) and they seemed extremely convincing that they were committed to this. Josh has represented both BFL and Bitcoin in many interviews I've read, I really don't think he'd stand for any bullshit around not shipping.
4) Do you think it would have been better for them to have a desk with nothing on it, than at least the box that the (soon to ship) chips will fill, given that they are supposedly *this* close to actual delivery? I don't know.

Oh, wait. Official hoteling has a million fees and taxes. Thanks for aborting a possible new cottage industry, assholes.

I learned the hard way. When Jobs came back to Apple I wanted to go in big. Someone convinced me "not to invest emotionally." That guy clearly was an idiot. :) I had been an Apple fan and follower for years and knew what Jobs brought to the company and just *knew* he would not let his baby get its ass kicked by the PC hegemony.
And yet I did nothing.
Bitcoin is my second shot at an Apple.
