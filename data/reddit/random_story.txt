HE'S LYING, IT TAKES 72 HOURS TO TRANSFER 50 BITCOINS
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:08:15
I'm sure they can figure out a way to show something that isn't totally misleading lol.
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:51:55
Why do they always show these like stock photos of physical coins with the Bitcoin logo on it. THAT IS NOT WHAT BITCOINS ARE LMFAO
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:49:36
Could have said Block Unchained. HUGE missed opportunity. Also why does every newscaster have to sound exactly the fucking same. Like... whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:04:22
How long does it take once you buy BTC for it to be in your account, available to sell?
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:25:10
They look fantastic!!! Wonderful job
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:19:37
No way, everyone has always known about everything. Everybody knows that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:28:03
I don't see a way to do that, I only see order expressed in BTC
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:06:57
Ok. Well, either you agree or you don't. I'm not here to convince anybody. Just a suggestion
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:45:40
True, but that is a nice round, large figure that a lot of people will see as a selling point
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:42:38
Why did you get downvoted? This seems like a really good point

@_date: 2013-11-25 01:04:20
Best solution to being rich imo is to buy what's called an annuity. You give a financial company your huge amount of cash (say 5 million dollars) and they invest it for you and then give you a yearly salary, like a job. So you might set it up for them to give you $7500/mo over 60 years or something. That way you are set for life, don't have to "work", but also don't have to worry about spending too much or alienating yourself from all your friends, or worrying about people asking you for money, etc. 
Buy an annuity!
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:04:47
Wow thanks :))
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:35:44
No it's not a loan, you give them the money basically to keep away from you so you don't spend it. They invest the portion that they aren't paying you monthly so that you end up with more money than you started with. After 60 years you would not have any money left.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:16:55
Yeah, me too. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:21:15
How hard is mining? I know I know, I should just look it up. But how hard is it if you have no programming experience but are good at math?
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:27:51
Has coinbase ever really just absorbed peoples' money?
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:20:38
Well maybe we should allow pornography, too. That's free speech right?

What's more troubling is why he isn't passing the ball at all
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:10:36
I'm getting the same message. This is my first time trying to buy bitcoins :(
How can this happen? Are their servers just not set up to handle this much traffic? I don't understand. Is there a better website for buying/selling I should know about? This sucks
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:35:58
And that the silkroad guy is in jail, they caught him. All the guy could say to that was, "took long enough".

It says the app isn't available in the U.S. store :/ great
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:11:56
Well finally someone who can at least sympathize with my apparently radical point of view
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:55:48
There are lots of subs that ban memes, so your point doesn't mean anything. Reddit is a collection of subs, which can change their rules at any time. You don't agree? Fine, but an official sub for a serious new currency shouldn't have memes in it. I take this seriously. Bank monopolization is a huge huge huge problem, we're all aware. This is a great way to take our power back. Please consider what I'm saying, and don't just react to the criticism. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:01:59
I don't have enough money to buy anymore. Probably best I didn't gamble my rent money anyway :P
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:34:29
This is something I've worried about. People are used to there being one of something at a pretty low price, currency-wise. So if one bitcoin costs 10,000 dollars people are going to be really confused. We have to start coming up with some names for .1 bitcoins and .01 bitcoins, other than using just strict numerical values.
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:08:39
What I want doesn't require you to be against big banks. I think this sub would get more subscriptions if there were no memes. I say this because as a new subscriber I'm put off by them. That's all.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:20:24
Well, 'first 5 free' doesn't really mean anything to me, since they will go by very quickly and then I'll have to start paying for them.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:02:21
Nobody really knows for sure, it could go either way in the short term and really it depends on what your investment strategy is. Do you want long term growth, like years, or are you looking to cash out quickly? 
If you want a long term investment that will pay off, I personally think bitcoin is a good place to put your money. It's only just now becoming popular, having been mentioned in the congress, and it's being used in developing countries more and more, and China, so there will be a huge amount of money coming in in the next several years.
If you want to get in and out quickly though, well it's anyone's guess what it will do in the next week. There's a lot of speculation that it will hit over 1000 or more and then the bubble will burst, and it will crash to a much lower figure. Or it could climb higher and burst at 2000. Or it could keep climbing with only minimal drops along the way, past 2000 and up to 10,000 in a month.
There are no rules in this -- it all depends on who decides to buy and who decides to sell, and when they all decide to do it. 
So the golden rule seems to be: don't put in more than you're willing to completely lose.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:13:31
All this speculation. I don't know who to believe
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:15:24
I want to buy right now but coinbase won't let me. They want to sell me a bitcoin at whatever value it has on Friday. What??
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:22:48
I know, that's my point. Using 'p' is a colloquialism because it's also short for pounds, and yet it's used as describing pence. And no I've never written 'c' to denote cents
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:49:56
Do they? I'm sure every country has at least some kind of slang for their currency.
I just think it sounds labored to say, "This costs .2 bitcoins". Rather than just saying "it costs twenty cents". We need a cent equivalent for .01 bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:23:50
Do Italians wear axe body spray, too?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:53:30
Ah, thanks
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:02:39
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:55:51
I think we should call .01 bitcoins a micro-bit, or a micro for short. "This costs twenty micros"
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:29:14
Fine, let's all make jokes and the /r/ can stay below 100k
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:46:09
And  yet, quick look at yields:


@_date: 2013-11-25 01:06:06
What?? lol. Why would someone want to skype you
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:06:04
Haha okay okay. But what do we call .01??
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:36:38
Doesn't what
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:29:31
No, it will stay at the price I ordered it at, I just mean, who knows what the market prices will do in the next week.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:20:00
I'm also starting to look at this as a multi year investment. Otherwise it's just too crazy!
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:26:03
Because people are using bitcoin to make short term investments rather than to buy things. It's a volatile market. It's not a sure thing that it will hit 1,000 and then crash or the bubble will burst, but it's not entirely baseless, either.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:24:01
I know, I remember that but I don't remember the actual figure. I want to know how close he came
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:57:19
No, I didn't miss that part. They had to decide to use 'p' for pence and not for pounds. I'm saying maybe we should do something similar with bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:10:58
I'm getting it on my laptop...weird!
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:15:15
These articles are both about variable interest rate annuities, obviously those are going to be bad. I'm talking about fixed rate annuities, and of course you want to have good terms before you sign up for one, but to me the main benefit is that you are given a monthly "salary" rather than having a lump sum to worry about all the time. I'm not all that knowledgeable about financial instruments though, perhaps there's a better way to achieve this than with an annuity?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:41:05
Ugh, I went through the whole signup process with bitcoinreminder, verified my email address and my mobile, only to find out they charge you to send reminders. Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:56:46
I think it's just that they want to have intelligent discussions about anarchism without a bunch of BS mixed in, because they take the anarchy movement seriously.
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:00:05
Seriously. Reddit is a collection of sub-reddits, and there are many subs that don't allow memes. I simply want to offer that this sub might want to consider that path. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:58:34
He did seem just a little too smug. And pretending to not know how to pronounce 'Gallippi', I think is a classic attempt to marginalize somebody. Oh *how* do you pronounce your crazy ass name, new guy?
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:24:17
Woah. And why I wonder can't you just buy things with QR codes regularly? Pay your restaurant bill, etc, with Bitcoin of course (or otherwise).
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:54:09
I just bought half a bitcoin (my first purchase ever) from  They have to verify your bank account and phone number but once you do that you can start buying and selling. I don't get my BTC in my account until Monday, though, and who knows what the price will do between now and then.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:12:00
I tried to sign up and use campbx, got this message:


In the meantime, please use money orders or checks to fund your account. We apologize for the inconvenience. 
Seems like they're having similar problems as coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:26:26
Haha. Decaying urban sprawl, check. Political Wild West, check. Computers everywhere/in everything, check. Decentralized, digital currency, check. Virtual reality escapism, check. Replicants...? Still missing

Si-bitcoin? what
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:24:29
Me too :) 
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:05:54
So if we remove memes, you're saying Bitcoin will devolve into an institution similar to Chase and the NSA? I know you don't actually believe that
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:05:59


This is from Coinbase. Wth!! Who would put in a buy order, not knowing what the price will be then??

"Hundred millis please" 
I like that :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:06:52
Way too confusing for the population. I think we need colloquialisms, and fast!
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:00:31
I watch a lot of British shows, don't they say "p" to indicate fractions of a pound (or quid)? So something might cost "50 p".

You run that site, don't you
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:36:51
Now is a great time to invest in bitcoin, it would seem
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:35:08
That's a great philosophy, I think I might take that approach as well. Do you keep your wallet just as a file on your computer? Aren't you worried about it getting hacked and stolen, though?
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:57:58
Most of all annuities sold are rip offs? I'm curious to know where you're getting your data.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:13:32
I don't trust these kinds of posts. I imagine a group of like 50 people coordinated to all upvote the same speculative post...
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:12:29


This isn't even a little true
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:40:55
So a cent? But that's too confusing which you're talking about. I guess bitcent? As someone else mentioned
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:25:25
That's great. Why does coinbase take a week?
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:44:41
It just seems like when it hits $1000 everyone will sell and then it will fall really fast, and unless you act right when it hits $1000 you'll get screwed. But, I guess it's better to think of it as more of a long term investment...
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:43:09
Because he clearly has a full head of hair

@_date: 2013-11-09 00:27:37
Alright, but you're taking my tiny change -- text-only, and unfairly exaggerating it to include modes of dress, attitude shifts, fear of the unknown, etc etc.
I totally understand where you're coming from, but I also think you're making an unfair exaggeration.

@_date: 2013-11-19 20:37:34
I don't have a credit card, I just have the debit card associated with my bank account. Does that work?
edit: nevermind, just tried. debit cards aren't supported 
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:20:54
This is hilarious!
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:07:36
Yes, you absolutely need to say more
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:14:00
Of course I'm US centric, I live in the United States. I've lived here my whole life.
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:01:45
Also, while this sub isn't an official representative of Bitcoin, it nevertheless could be a giant hub for people to find out about Bitcoin and spread the word about it. Again, memes have no place here. I don't think anyone comes here for the comedy, I really doubt they'd be missed.
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:05:07
for one, which has over 4  million subscribers. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:01:43
But what does .01 BTC get called? you've already started at the thousandth place
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:00:43
That looks like good pizza, mang
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:51:11
Wait, is that an actual physical bitcoin? What??
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:35:13
True, although it's also short for pounds.
And in the U.S. we don't say 'c' 
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:10:02
I mean to be helpful. It's an honest suggestion from someone who wants to see this sub at over a million people. I don't think it will get there with memes. This is not meant to insult anyone.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:56:04
Nah that's no good!
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:02:53
It doesn't seem to matter what people's intentions are. If you buy bitcoins you are taking power away from large banks.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:37:28
He was great but c'mon man, spiked, gelled hair? This aint middle school
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:48:04
You're right this is idiotic, people who didn't watch the hearing are going to get the wrong impression...shit
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:17:08
Exactly, memes seem to be against the rules. But this opinion seems to be in the minority. Let's hope the mods agree with us
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:36:20
Well that's gonna suck
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:56:39
That's too obscure. How about .01 BTC = 1 "micro"
How much is a cup of coffee? Two micros, please
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:15:56
I had no idea people felt so strongly about this 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:02:50
Yeah, I like that idea. Although at the current market price, $1 would be equal to ~180,000 Satoshis.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:48:58
Good job idiot, you're taking this tiny offhand remark and eroding faith in a burgeoning currency
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:03:47
See, this image is actually a great ad, and it's what led me here. But it's not a meme, it's just artwork for an advertisement. I personally see a big difference.

Seems like a historic high is not the best time to buy.

@_date: 2013-11-09 02:13:09

@_date: 2013-11-19 22:54:32
Sweet so in the future youll be like, "how much for this cream soda?" and the guy will say "twenty micros"
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:01:51
Shhhhh
