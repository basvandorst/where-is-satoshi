You can totally recover the coins if you can retrieve the privatekey. If using bitcoin-cli you have an option called dumpprivkey which tou might want to use.

well, one opening and one closing can have 10 (or if we are really optimist 1M) transactions in between
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:25:05
With LN the only transactions that will be seen on-chain are the establishment and liquidation of channel. Therefore, even if the majority of txn will happen over LN, we won't be able to tell

". But I've seen no evidence suggesting that Tethers aren't backed by real dollars."
...nor evidence suggesting otherwise
"Why would the price move away from 1 USD? "
it does - i've seen USDT sold for 0.98 as well as 1.05 - it's a matter of demand and supply at a specific moment (if the btc is dropping like a rock you'd pay 1.01-1.02-1.03 to 'lock in' the price, no? you'd mark 1-2-3% loss on the USDT trade, but keep the USD value)

You start with the assumption that you have your money spread over many inputs, but what if it's the opposite? You have a single big output which you diminish on each transaction

Indeed and itbit offers such a service

Because they are NOT paying the fees (for a while now) , they are subtracted from the users. Check your withdrawals.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:38:59
My 1BTC withdrawal took 1.00065873 BTC out of my account, and there's an entry that says Fees 0.00065873. So I guess you're privileged, not having to pay fees

No, but they will invite sometimes in the not so distant future, Dimon, Stieglitz and other doom prophets
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:22:05
they have different fees for SEPA vs Wires. SEPA is quite cheap (e.g. less than 1Eur for non trivial withdrawals), wires are in the high tens, low hundreds of Eur

It does, but only CLI - addwitnessaddress 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:46:52
I believe that, combined, they're more like one order of magnitude more (so more like 10-20k)
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:51:10
well, duh, ..an official source
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:43:44
then what 'addwitnessaddress' (cli, probably similar if you use UI) does? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:19:06
+1 for Bitstamp. Not only customer support, but their service actually works
@_date: 2018-09-03 22:12:51
From code point of view, you'll find a couple options, one being lightning charge 
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:54:10
As of today, from what I know, no implementation allows topup (I guess the term would be splice-in), close and reopen or rebalance (through an out of band/on-chain transaction)

I think it's one of the earliest recorded facepalms (thus not entirely similar with what we have now). And could be a facepalm regarding BU and/or a potential fork.

Yes, but did I tell you how I don't regret it? At all. Not even a bit. Nada.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:47:53
 seems to work
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:04:45
I find it somehow ironic that, except for the first block (which anyway took like 4 hours to be mined), all the blocks are really minuscule (well below 100k). It's true, that there might not be too much to put into blocks (as there are almost no transactions), but still...
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:16:21
 although seems to be stuck on block

Before commenting, did anyone took the time to look over the PR ? It clearly says (also the comments point to the same thing)
if (GetTime() &lt; 1533096000) {
Which means that it was only in place before 1st of Aug (the exact date is  1 August 2018 07:00:00 GMT)

Yes, until something like Atomic Multi Path becomes a reality, the sending ends along the route have to have the balance required for the whole payment

Is exempt of Value Added Tax (VAT, equiv of sales tax in US), that's true. But it's not exempt of capital gains, property or whatever is classified as in each country.

That tends to happen to me as well when using eclair. But this only means that the (mobile) clients are one step behind. There are only two (eclair by the same acinq and another one) and I could not test the desktop clients (Zap), but lately using c-lightning's cli most of my payments go through (the viable ones, i.e. where there is a route from my node to the destination)

@_date: 2018-02-25 08:51:16
I can't understand why acinq's explorer  only shows about 1800 nodes. Granted each node has a different view of the network, but the difference is too big in my view
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:10:57
if you have no idea what I was trying to say (I guess you don't really understand how LN works) it's ok to not post any coments, instead of making unfounded accusations - how can I be spreading FUD talking abut TESTNET?
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:44:51
That's spot on. At least one of the ends of the channel has to put in money. If you're mostly receiving, it should be easier for you to get others to fund channels to you. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:51:16
It's not about the transactions in the block (90% of them are empty), but the number of blocks (like 1/s). If you close a non-cooperative channel and you have to wait 144 blocks, at this speed will only take you 2 mins 
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:34:20
I think that's what are called submarine swaps \(heard it from Alex Bosworth\). Or, at least, it's the same concept, see e.g. [

Besides the discussion on futility of market caps (for BCC, that is), the whole scramble by everyone to get their coins out from exchanges led, in my view of it, to the sudden increase in price - 15% in the last day or so.
As for the BCC,  its price will converge towards 0 as it gets closer to Aug 1.

More like 1900. Still 2.2k would've yielded 25% in 3-4 days
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:45:05
same here, although not so much money. However between the time I submitted the ticked and now, I lost 50% of the account value because of this shitty exchange's inability to handle requests (and because I was unable to trade as most of my funds are hanging out in some glitches) . I am wondering why this kind of shithole (it's not a company) still continues to take people's money. They are prime candidates for a successor to MtGox
