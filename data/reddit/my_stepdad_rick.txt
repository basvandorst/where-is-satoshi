The developers working on Bitcoin Core are working on implementing a floating transaction fee. This would find the lowest transaction fee possible while still including your transaction in the next block. This allows the cost of a transaction to automatically float with the exchange rate.

Except with $50 coins, it would be next to impossible to move significant amounts of money through bitcoin. If someone wanted to move $10 million, they would need 200,000 coins, which would be almost 1.6% of all coins currently in circulation. The total market cap would only be $632 million, which would be prohibitively small for any sort of large scale money transmission.
These calculations also assume that all of the bitcoins that have been mined are circulating, eg not in cold storage, sitting on exchanges, or otherwise being held long term.
Essentially, $50/BTC means bitcoin has failed.

The incentives just aren't there to pay with bitcoin. It's not worth the effort of exchanging dollars to BTC to pay for stuff. You pay fees going $ to BTC and most retailers don't give discounts for paying in BTC. You give up all sorts of personal information to the exchanges or to Coinbase or Circle, so that eliminates the privacy benefits of using bitcoin. And you don't want to hold on to them for too long because you never know where the price is going.
Bitcoin still isn't easy to understand or use and it still doesn't offer the average person anything that Paypal, Visa, and the USD don't.

Yeah and no other money in the world is bitcoin. We are designing a currency from the ground up, why not do it right?
If people can remember BTC, mBTC, uBTC, and satoshi they will be fine. Bitcoin, millibit, microbit, satoshi. It's really not that hard. Explaining this will be easier than explaining proof of work, confirmation times, public/private keys, etc.  In the US, we remember pennies, nickles, dimes, and quarters. Those aren't intuitive, but you don't see anyone having a hard time with them.

Bitcoin is many things to different people. China, for example, treats bitcoin primarily as an investment. There are very few actual places to spend BTC in China, but they make up a sizable portion of the market. In the US, you can use BTC at TigerDirect and Overstock and other large retailers. Bitcoin is use agnostic. Some people use it as a store of value, others use it as a payment processor, and people in the future will likely use it in ways we can't even dream of.

Because they are talking about the Dark web, where those things are fueled by bitcoin. We can try to whitewash bitcoin's history as much as we'd like but without the Silk Road, bitcoin would be nowhere near where it is now. For a long time the Silk Road was the only legitimate use of bitcoin outside of speculation and alpaca socks. The Silk Road existed since bitcoin reached dollar parity. It's hard to tell who simply wasn't around at that time and who is trying to revise history.

I'm not trying to be insensitive, but it's not like the "better and safer way to hold our coins" hasn't been figured out yet.

Gox has been generally incompetent for years, and particularly incompetent for months.

If you were trading/doing commerce with most of the 35 BTC you're right. But a cold wallet for the majority of the funds and a hot wallet for spending/trading is generally considered best practice and not too inconvenient.

It is already common practice to use 'k' to mean thousand, as in $50k. Additionally, commas are standard to easily differentiate between orders of magnitude. That doesn't happen with zeroes after the decimal point. If 0.000,000,001 was proper I would agree with you. It's hard to tell the difference at first glance between 0.0000001 and 0.00000001. There are readability issues at stake and it's better to go with widely understood scientific convention instead of making up stupid names like 'bits' that already have far more widespread uses outside of cryptocurrency.
And, for the record, if we were redesigning dollar naming conventions from the ground up like we are with bitcoin, I would be an advocate of kilodollars etc.

That's where assurance contracts come in. They can be regionally "kickstarter-ed", so nobody owns them and nobody profits except the cars themselves.

The cost of double spending or reversing a transaction is very high. Each confirmation is essentially another 'layer' of difficulty in changing that transaction.

Yes, he is being extremely optimistic. I am of the opinion he is just trying to assuage everyone's fears. Somebody so outspokenly anti-centralization and security conscious surely knows better than to just sweep this under the rug.
His argument seems to be that anyone with 51% of the hashing power has no economic incentive to double spend and destroy faith in bitcoin. Bitcoin was designed to be trustless and that includes not having to trust GHash.io. 
Even if we can trust 100% that they wouldn't intentionally do any harm to the bitcoin ecosystem, we still have to trust that they haven't been raided by the CIA and slapped with gag orders or been compromised in some other way.
If the future of the network is in the hands of some anonymous mining pool, what makes bitcoin any better than fiat?
Oh, and if you weren't already worried, there's no guarantee (that I know of. I'd love to be corrected on this.) that GHash doesn't own some of the 19% of unknown hashing power.
I say this as a balls-to-the-wall bitcoin evangelist permabull: Mining centralization is currently the biggest threat to bitcoin. And spamming every two months isn't going to solve the issue. Until miners are financially incentivized to switch, they won't.

You're right, I definitely oversimplified. But SHA-256 is definitely the most common algorithm used for brainwallets, and for somebody who has to ask how to enter a brainwallet, the chances they used SHA-256 are extremely high. And it is absolutely best practice to reveal as little information about your passwords as possible. If OP reveals how many words are in his passphrase, that significantly narrows down the bruteforce parameters of a would-be attacker.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:22:04

Good choice! Many people believe bitcoin has a binary outcome. It will either be worth $0 or a fortune. There's not a whole lot of room for middle ground.

They might not be the ones moving the scene forward, but they are plentiful and vocal enough to turn this community into a joke. Outsiders see a bunch of nerds trying to get rich and don't take the time to learn about the protocol and how revolutionary it could be. That's their first impression and now instead of being receptive to bitcoin, they just want to distance themselves from the community full of libertarian neckbeards playing out weird fantasies where they are rich beyond their wildest dreams because they had the foresight to invest in the Glorious Bitcoin. It makes the whole thing smell like a Ponzi. I know it's not, but that's what these kinds of posts read like.

I have to say that I am not a fan of the palm scanner. I was excited for the ATMs to hit, but I can't see myself using one that involves biometrics in any way. But there will be many that have no problem with it, and hopefully this will make it easier for them to get involved.

Yeah, but will pretending that it isn't an ideal black market currency make it any less so? Are we going to push the protocol in a direction that will lower is usefulness as a black market currency?
On a slightly unrelated note, I wonder if or how hard the US government will try to get a mole on the core dev team.

When a new address is created, how can one be sure that it hasn't been generated before by someone else's client? I know there is a huge number of possible addresses, but if (for argument's sake) 7 billion people are creating dozens of addresses each, aren't there bound to be some repeats? And this doesn't include businesses who create a new address for each of their hundreds or thousands of transactions.

I built a brand new gaming computer from parts on bitcoinstore.com back when coins were $70 a piece. Those 13.5 coins are now worth over $3,000. No regrets though because I mined those coins back in 2010 and I wanted to take some profits just in case. Now I'm in it for the long haul.

This is definitely not the first place I've heard of $100,000 coins. There are many people who are certain that bitcoin is going to $1000 or $10000 or $1 million. They post logarithmic charts assuring that everyone on this sub will be millionaires by April of next year. I'm not convinced that is going to happen.

Bitcoin is still young. It's still in beta. The biggest thing holding bitcoin back is the barrier to entry. Bitcoin will explode once people don't need to give gox or bitstamp or w/e a birth certificate, a fingerprint, and a bj just to buy BTC. These things take time.

Don't buy 10 grand USD worth of bitcoins on the advice of a throwaway account posting on Reddit. If you truly believe in the fundamentals of bitcoin and think it will succeed, go for it. But taking financial advice from someone with literally ZERO accountability is never, ever, ever a good idea.
At the very least, wait until he actually makes this wager before believing him. Even then, be cautiously optimistic at most.

If you are going to be devastated if this whole crazy project fails, stay far away. Because that is what bitcoin truly is. It is a crazy idea with the potential to change the world. Nobody knows where this technology will be in 1, 5, 10, or 20 years. It could be dead or it could revolutionize the world of finance.
People lose their minds trying to day trade bitcoin. The market is small enough to be manipulated and nobody knows the true value of a bitcoin. If you buy coins, buy them because you believe in the fundamental ideas behind the project and believe it will be successful.

They have been accepting bitcoin for a while. I bought some food here last time I was in Vegas and it was phenomenal. The woman running the place didn't really know much about the payment process though. She said her son handles the bitcoin payments most of the time, but he wasn't in. She gave me a piece of paper with a qr code on it, I calculated the price in bitcoins, paid, and I was on my way. 10/10 would eat there again.

This is a pretty awesome development. This could be really important. From that thread:


You open multibit and plug the BitSafe into your computer. One of your greyed-out wallets becomes highlighted.
You navigate to bitmit.com, and purchase something for 1.815 BTC. Multibit handles the Bitcoin URI and gives you a payment prompt.
After approving multibit's payment prompt, a light flashes on the BitSafe and "Send 1.815 BTC to  appears on the OLED display.
You press the "approve" button on the BitSafe and the relevant Bitcoin transaction propagates to the rest of the Bitcoin network.

It seems to me the bubbles/crashes are a symptom of the distribution of what is intended to be a borderless currency. If it is successful, the price will necessarily be higher than it is now. This is price discovery in action. I believe once the hype is over and bitcoin has settled into its role (whatever that may be), it will exhibit much different behavior.
