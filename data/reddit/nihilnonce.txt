You came up with the same numbers as me, I'm planning on 65k a year for 46 years or until I die

 Congrats man.  I've been holding since 2011 when I was mining with gpus... I'm now retired at 39. Now working on my own coin projects in my free time.  ��

OP I understand you are trying to be sensitive to people losing money. But really there are 2 options here.
1. It's not as bad as you are saying and they don't care about some low level vulnerability that is impossible to exploit. Without details nobody knows.
2. I'm not sure if you are a security researcher or not. But most people that find bugs for a living, will give the company a limited amount of time before they go public with it. This helps to force companies to fix things. You give them a heads up, stating this bug will be publicly released on this date in the future. The day before send them another email saying it again. Then release it. If they  haven't fixed it by then, suddenly it will be fixed rather quickly if it's really that bad.

I like this, but it's just a matter of time before you get banned from play store. There have been a number of games that have done this, that have gotten banned.


The problem is that Google wants to ban any games of skill, which this is, that offers prizes of value. Obviously Bitcoin has value. Sorry, but it's just a matter of time.

Try Sherlocks in Addison. I've talked to the day bar manager Robert a few times about BTC. He is knowledgable about it, so it might be a easier sell than just somebody that doesn't know about it. Plus drunk people buying BTC seems fun. Although no idea if they would buy it without motivation.

I hope you wont. But reading their terms, games of skill with prizes equate to being violation of their gambling provision, even if it's not gambling. 
This game was banned doing the same thing with no gambling:

Honest questions.
Maybe I am misunderstanding, but how you are getting around gambling laws? It seems like you are suggesting for cash games you are required to put up a fee.
How are you guys securing this? It is extremely hard to secure a client from hacks, if not impossible. So even if you are doing something like running all games on the server with just input from the client, if money is involved it would be just a matter of time that somebody writes a emulator to play a "perfect" game.

Gotcha... thanks for the answers.
I'll pull for you guys as I like the idea.

I was there and saw the demo. While it's correct and a tool was released, I was disappoint that the speakers kept saying how millions were stolen from Mt Gox this way. From what I know about the situation only a few transactions against Mt Gox actually had this issue occur. But who knows if we will ever know the truth.

OP... Good find and just the talk of disclosure worked to get the publicity needed to fix it. :)

My 2 bits.
I'm not sure how this is any different than a typical public/private key setup that is used in technologies such as SSH/PGP/etc. This has been around a long while. How including blockchain tech with this idea is going to get rid of passwords? Hmmm no...
The problem has always been what happens when the users lose their keys? If the data is encrypted with their keys, the user just lost all their data. If it's not then all that data is lost when the server gets hacked.
The hardware wallet isn't a option either. What happens when that hardware is stolen/lost/destroyed?
Passwords have been declared dead many times. I've yet to see a tech that will actually allow it and allow for ease of access and recovery to an account that your average consumer is going to require.

Well it's nice another person is backing bitcoin, but personally I'm not a big fan of hers. IMHO she seems like a confused college student looking for acceptance any where she can get it.
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:18:34
No the biggest problem is how are you going to secure the score? It gets hacked in 5 minutes, and now you are going to owe cheaters.
@_date: 2014-10-17 21:32:15
I believe that's correct, however when you can join anybodies topic it doesn't really matter at that point. Never used it, but just have read about it, so maybe there are "private" channels that I don't know about.

Why is that trustee still even alive?

As somebody that had my btc wallet on my phone, (with all my btc on it, stupid) and traveling internationally at the beginning of the year. I simply marked no I'm not carrying more than 10k, and border control wouldn't even look at me besides to say welcome home.

Yes the could block US IP addresses, but they will not. Just because you come from a US IP doesn't mean you are a US citizen. 
All the bigger ICOs already put that disclaimer up.
