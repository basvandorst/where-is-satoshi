Dollar cost average. Buy with half your desired investment now, and spent the rest in 5 days/ a week. That way If a dip happens, you won't be left out, and worse case scenario, you end up paying a bit more in the second purchase.

I've known about it since 2012 or 2013, and didn't buy until like a 3.5 weeks ago when it dipped. I feel a little regretful, but then I think about the people who bought in way early, only to sell for meager profits or the people who lost their private keys, and think about how much worse that would be.
I'm up almost 3x my initial investment in a very short period of time, so I can't be too bitter about the whole situation.

I second this. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:34:13
Not if, but when it hits 20k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:06:09
It's bouncing back nicely tho. It should be back to 480ish shortly.

College Student here. I invested  most of my savings when bitcoin dipped to $5800 a couple weeks ago. I'm quite pleased with my decision atm. Just leave yourself enough to get by.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:24:04
$5 away. Wow.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:54:29
Hmm weird. I'm logged back in, but I went to the buy screen just out of curiosity and it wouldn't let me do anything.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:35:19
Try to sell and see what happens lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:22:52
No, it'll be worth $100.

vaporwave artist? Get off my lawn!

A)You've unfairly phrased the question.
B) If you want to live somewhere where there's no state collecting taxes, move to the Congo or something, and see how you like it.
Of course, many of the things our taxes go towards paying are ridiculous and unnecessary, but taxes are a necessary evil if you want to live in a civil prosperous society.

Idk, but If it gets under 8.5k, I'm  gonna buy a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:33:02
Idk. Feels bearish still. Although, it's probably a good buy at 9,500. Otherwise, set an alert/buy order at a desired price point and buy if it hits that point. That's what I'm doing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:10:04
Hopefully to at least 8k, optimally 6k. I want to sell at 10 and buy back in to accrue more BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:51:31
It logged me out too. Just log back in. It'll send you an SMS code, and then you'll have to confirm your email. After that it said it wasn't working, but I just hit cancel and it logged me back in.

When will BTC stabilize? No idea.
Does it have to stabilize before it replaces fiat? Absolutely. Imagine taking a loan of 50 BTC 3 years ago. You'd be completely fucked because you'd have been lent way less value then you would owe. Currency has to be relatively stable to be used.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:23:34
I'd say wait until at least a 10% dip.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:07:33
Chinese usually buy now, ask questions later.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:07
As far as the first two questions go, I have no idea, but regarding an average joe making an exchange, I find that improbable. I'm certain you have to have strong financial backing, along with being quite tech savvy to start one.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:33:29
I bought a good amount at the last big dip two Sundays ago, but I want to buy more..
If you're really eager to buy, then you don't have to wait. In all likelihood, you'll make money long term at the current price, but buying the dip is always so much more gratifying.

Name a civil, prosperous society that didn't/doesn't  tax its citizens.
By you making the claim that taxation is theft, the implication is that it should be illegal, which is absurd. I have no idea who you are, or where you're from, but I can say with complete confidence that you have in many ways benefitted from others' tax dollars, whether it be from infrastructure, public education, healthcare etc. If you benefit from the system, it's only right that you pay into it.
And no, society couldn't run off of charity because as we all know, most people are quite greedy. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:17:00
I hope you're right. I bought the last dip at 5800, but I want to buy more. If it gets to 7k or under, I'll buy for sure, but I'll really consider buying if it's under 7.5k.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:35:58
I might sell a portion of my BTC, buy some alts, let them grow while I wait for the 10k dip to hopefully set in, then buy back in.

A lot of people who probably wanted to sell couldn't, so they may do it now that coinbase is back up. We may see another dip.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:14:42
Lmao, they were using those old school mailroom tubes to process transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:19:28
Go open a bank account somewhere and have at it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:44:40
On the coinbase app, on the bottom bar there is an alerts tab. Once you hit that button, there's an ad button at the top right to add alerts. I don't know about other exchanges

I think most would welcome a 20% drop. Btfd
