Is your name a reference to Payday the Heist/ Payday 2?

Does the changetip bot count as a receipt? I don't want to fund international terrorism.

This infuriates me as a similar situation happened to my friend's younger brother. Instead of Bitcoin, he wrote about an issue within the Chinese industry, I'm not sure of the exact translation, but certain restaurants use cooking oil over and over again causing carcinogens to accumulate. The teacher not only called him a liar but gave him detention for "not taking the class seriously". Unfortunately, his mother did not speak English very well so I had to be there instead. Don't go on a witch-hunt like some people here demand. Do not even think about getting the teacher fired. This is what I did: I printed multiple sources on the topic and basically force fed them to the teacher.Don't do what I did, because this caused the teacher to find faults with him again, and required me to waste more time on someone who was so thick skulled, a 50 caliber round to the head would seem like a tiny dink. Ask the teacher to define a ponzi scheme. Then ask the teacher to cite their sources, don't take any bullshit, but acknowledge any valid points they make. Ask them if they know how Bitcoins work, they will most likely make a stupid story up. Ask them to study the subject and to schedule a future meeting where you can both discuss the topic on equal grounds and request for a reevaluation afterwards. If he continues the bullshit, forget it. Escalate to someone who can have a proper discussion

How much is that?

Equations for this?

And this contributes how? By bringing Western Union, you're instigating the topic more

Well said! Silly comics probably peak the interest of the average Joe Shmoe more than a number

I guess you'll just have to, wait a BIT! *I'll leave*

Bitcoin is not a service, it is not a publicly nor privately owned entity. It is a currency. Are you promoting a currency against a service?

Wrong subreddit. You're looking for dogecoin

Alright, I'll refrain from such. (Not sarcasm, tone is hard to convey through text)

Bitcoin isn't a privately owned corporation. You can't sue Bitcoin. Cellular providers trash each other all the time

So you're telling me that the creative usage part of law isn't real?

The bot rounds the numbers, so 2.49 appears as 2, but 4.98 appears as 5, therefore 2+2=5

That's only 10,000 dollars more than flipping burgers annually, sounds like a lot but in reality it's pretty pathetic. Someone of his caliber is typically paid 120,000 yearly

You have a point, but there is a fatal error in your judgement (coding joke intended). You program, yes? Maybe you maybe a very good program that small companies may want to buy, and you sell it to them, yes? Too bad this guy programmed something that is INTERNATIONAL and is something that should receive updates, FOREVER. You're probably a very good person, but your programs don't match up to his calibre
