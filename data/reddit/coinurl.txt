PLEASE! 
Peercoin is one of the largest cryptos and has a huge following, not to mention massive contributions to cryptocurrency in general!  
You would be a hero for implementing it!!

If people care, they will upvote, if they don't, they will keep scrolling or downvote.  That's how the system on Reddit works, you new here?


Right.  Payment providers have nothing to do with Bitcoin.  Because this is not a network involving finance.


I can not summoning users to do my bidding for me.  I stand in no way to benefit from this.  I'm just pointing it out, what exactly is your problem?

There's a warrant for his arrest.  I don't think it's the last we hear of Danny boy.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:22:28
What about [Peercoin](
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:36:51
This isn't a solution.  They could be at 45% on their big pool and have 12% somewhere else and it's no better than having 57% at GHASH.

So we can have reward halving parties! 
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:21:46
huh?  why?  it's not my website.....?  I run [CoinURL.com]( we have no business with these people.  I just found this list of payment providers and figured you guys needed to bombard them with Bitcoin-related invites.  Like usual?

LOTS of 3000?  Is that how it's going down?  I was hoping for the whales to have to outbid each other on the huge pile.

I don't fully understand the "nothing at stake" problem so I can't comment too much on it, but I will be looking into it.  
However, proof of work has problems.  So does proof of stake.  I'm saying it's a pretty good solution which seems to have fewer side effects and it doesn't require a limitless army of computers to achieve it.  Both systems are genius, but which is the one which can last 1000+ years?  
Also, Sunny King has said a few days ago that for Peercoin 0.5 he is considering [removing the checkpointing system forever](

They claim to be moving (a portion of) their hashrate somewhere else.  It's an illusion of security now.

^ You can't expect millions of people to use solar or wind energy for their farms.  These people use coal- or nuclear-based electricity and it has a negative impact on the planet, which will keep growing at an exponential rate.  The devices are going to get more energy efficient (I was going to refer to an article but it is saying the devices take 650w per GH, nowadays they take under 1w per GH so clearly it is becoming much more efficient which makes me happy however the people are still going to basically max out their power panels around the globe.  
Have you considered the impact of all these devices being printed?  Don't get me wrong, I'm a Bitcoin die-hard and I've devoted my life to this but the fact remains that people are practically throwing away their 130nm gear now.  It costs more to run than it's worth, and it's basically junk.  Millions of devices being printed and all destined for trash heaps, a chunk of which is on it's way there now.  It's not even really helping to secure the network if the big players are still in control of things, ghash.io still maintaining near 45% of the network and having to hold back hashrate... If they actually tried to attack the network it wouldn't be too difficult.  However Peercoin, that attack is not possible in that way.
This is why I refer to Peercoin as the savior, it's not perfect but at least it takes the environment into consideration in a few ways.  PoW for fair distribution, PoS for security, sustainability, and efficiency.  
And I will read the article, I feel like an ass commenting on something I haven't read.

Greetings! [CoinURL]( here.  We recommend trying the service out for yourself!  We have users who make upwards of 0.5 BTC per day, it is very profitable, but they also have very popular websites.  
If you get only a couple of clicks, well, no service is going to pay you a fortune for that.  Our rates are set by the public's bidding, the big ad campaigns come through and the amout paid per click will be higher but if the campaigns start to dry up the amount will go down, we are not in control of the rates.  If you have any further questions be sure to email info

Which, Satoshi's whitepaper?

@_date: 2014-06-10 22:29:37
Looks like about the same except I'm pretty sure the ASICMINER will be far cheaper to buy.

Where are your donation addresses?  Also can we pre-order a steam key if it gets released?  I don't really want to pay via the kickstarter, I'd rather pay in crypto.  
@_date: 2014-06-23 22:23:12
Why don't we just use Satoshi's already?
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:49:28
wow Way to downvote a completely legitimate submission!
What a thoughtful community we have here!
I bet a Dogecoin documentary would have made it to the first page with your logic.
@_date: 2014-06-16 17:39:13
Thank you for growing to the size you have attained!  If a solution is developed, you did the Bitcoin network a huge favor!
@_date: 2014-06-23 22:53:42
That logic came in handy for me lately, actually.  1 bit = 1 uBTC, right?  Because I was working on a website to convert the USD format into Bitcoin and the code was totally borked so I had to represent $0.01 = 1 satoshi, was much easier than rewriting everything.  $1 = 100 satoshi.  Worked great.  
You guys can call them bits, I'll call them uBTCs.

aluminum I could scrap for like 75 cents a pound, at the highest.. thing is probably less than  a pound.  the copper is worth about $3 per pound, maybe like 0.1 of a LB in copper (assuming 100% cleaned up).. not going to get $5 for it.

oh.  The actual article of this reddit thread.  Started to read it.. it says Bitcoin mining energy consumption is decreasing?  Right.

I don't think they would receive such a low figure with this movie.  I'll improve upon my idea, then:
Release it for free online, with a donation address, 480p resolution.  Will probably receive much more than a paper, but not a fortune.
Offer a 720p digital download for $5 (worth of BTC).
Offer a 1080p digital download for $10 (worth of BTC).
Offer a hardcopy for $20 (worth of BTC) mailed to your door, includes digital copies too.
Offer a deluxe hardcopy for $30 (worth of BTC) mailed to your door, containing an extra disc, bonus footage, etc.
Offer a limited, numbered, special edition hardcopy for $50 (worth of BTC) mailed to your door, containing a very special case, autographed, shiny cover, poster, whatever else you need to make it special.
Because honest people will pay, if the price is right.  With a movie, it's obvious that it will be on torrent an hour after the first copy is released.
I think a tiered system like this would do excellent.
Idea for price tiers:

Ask the 'coined' people!  I am just sharing it..

So far in the list Square is accepting Bitcoin, but not sure of the others.  
Bitcoin / Bitpay / Coinbase, these would be nice to have in that list as separate entities.
Also, maybe contact ALL of these payment processors too!
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:14:59
Anyone have a picture of the entire cover?

No, but [Peercoin]( is! :)

$10-15 maybe

I don't imagine Starbucks coffee costs much to make, so they're probably still in the green over it...  But if legit, it's a damn well affordable way to drink there!  I wish I could get $100 bills for $18 though.

Maybe next year, but probably in the next 10 years.

But.. I'm not saying a transaction fee will be $1M in the future, I'm saying (extremely ridiculous figure), 0.015 BTC will cost billions..  When 21,000,000 BTC = $2,100,000,000,000,000,000, then this email will (looking back) have cost a lot of money. 
I wasn't trying to be scientific.
@_date: 2013-08-12 20:15:47
I was saying probably worth a zillion.. is that even a real number though?  I was saying probably in the next 10 years Bitcoin will be worth a lot, in response to *"Bitcoin will be worth a zillion dollars by next year! Period. "*
I don't anticipate Bitcoin will get ridiculously high this year.  ~~Maybe~~ *Probably* this decade.
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:14:48
one day this email will have cost billions of dollars..

hey, CoinURL here.  We have a lot of ads running and it looks like 1 ad had malware on it so Google flagged our entire domain.  I removed that ad and resubmitted the review of our site and it should be finished in a couple hours.  
Hang in there!
I'll do a promotion to make up for this.  This is a disaster scenario but we have a plan on how to prevent this in the future.
