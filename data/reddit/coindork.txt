I think that you are on to something. Though there is very little infrastructure at this time, it seems to be the logical direction to go. We tend to forget that there is a whole class of people that are just outright banned from this system of credit. I can see bitcoin radically empowering those that are part of System D and allow for them to simply monetarily abscond away from enforced judgments. 
I feel that microcredit is along the same lines and it also needs to be radically reformed. Currently, the [average loan in the global south charges an usurious 37% interest]( It is my hope that someone will use digital currencies to develop a fair lending system that can extend capital to the farther reaches of the planet where no bank has gone before, regardless of what nationality someone is under.

First and foremost, I hope you understand that the word force implies violence and subjugation. 'Enforcement' is impossible unless it is done of the guise of the law and their truncheons. 
Second, creating instruments of debt, and then enforcing that that debt will both create centralization and governance, something bitcoin seems to be avoiding.
Third, how can you create bitcoin loans and not have substantial real debt gains? The deflationary properties that bitcoin exudes makes it a pretty terrible commodity for debt.

I've been paid exclusively in bitcoin for more than a year, and it's fine.
Because pretty much everyone is paid in nominal values (i.e. dollars) with bitcoin. So on payday, you cash out what you need for monthly expenses, and the rest goes into savings.
My bitcoin is my savings. This is my retirement plan, as the current racket of 401Ks will gouge away everything that you have worked for. [See this PBS Frontline for more details](
 
Keep in mind that as time goes on, the block reward will keep decreasing, more people will join the network, and more products and services will find their way into the market--all of which I believe will have bitcoin be successful over time, as in several years, not months. 
Sure it's a risk, but its better than waiting for the banks to shark away your money IMO.

Dig deeper, it gets way more screwed up. For example the Bank of International Settlements which was setup for war reparations from Germany to France after WWI. This bank was later taken over by the Nazis and used to launder massive sums of gold into Switzerland. 
In 1944 at the BW conference, Norway demanded that the bank be shutdown because the money came almost exclusively from the Gestapo, and so FDR agreed. However, due to the personal lobbying of John Maynard Keynes he had the british government convince Truman rolled this back, and the bank continued its operations.
Today the BIS is the central bank of central banks. That right, a Nazi bank pretty much runs the world...

Bitcoin's Fans Prefer to Keep Cash
Reeds Jewelers encouraged customers to pay for holiday gifts with bitcoin this year, but the family-owned business isn’t hanging onto the virtual currency for long.
Like many of the growing number of merchants that accept bitcoin, the regional jewelry store immediately converts the payments into real-world dollars. The strategy is aimed at protecting Reeds from big price swings that have plagued the virtual currency for much of the year—and underscores how many business owners remain skittish about the long-term prospects for bitcoin.
“We thought about [holding on to the bitcoin] but we’re just not willing to do it,” said Mitch Caan, marketing director for the Wilmington, N.C.-based jeweler which has roughly 60 stores, mostly in the Southeast.
The price of a bitcoin has tumbled since hitting a record $1,100 in November 2013 due to nagging concerns about potential regulation, the collapse of a large bitcoin exchange in Japan and the stigma that it is often used for illicit activity. One bitcoin was worth $318.10 Thursday on the CoinDesk price index.
Launched in 2009, bitcoin is an electronic currency that is created on computers and traded between people who store it in digital wallets. Although it has a core base of devotees among the young and tech-savvy, bitcoin has yet to gain a foothold in the broader economy, largely because of its perceived instability.
Many merchants during the holiday shopping season said they were willing to accept bitcoin as payment—because it costs them little to do so and could even help them save on the fees they pay for credit-card transactions—but expressed wariness about the risk involved in keeping the virtual currency for any length of time.
Many mainstream businesses have begun accepting bitcoin as payment for goods and services; Recent additions include software giant Microsoft Corp. , computer maker Dell Inc. and travel-booking company Expedia Inc. Those firms, like most businesses, convert their bitcoin sales into dollars immediately.
The matter of bitcoin’s price volatility “is the first question we get” from merchants that are interested in accepting bitcoin, says Adam White, director of business development for Coinbase, a San Francisco-based company that processes transactions for merchants who accept bitcoin.
Coinbase is one of several companies that takes merchant bitcoin payments and immediately converts them to dollars, and then sells the bitcoin. It has 37,000 merchant customers and charges 1% for transactions after a client’s first $1 million of bitcoin sales.
Financial institutions, by contrast, typically charge between 2% and 3% for credit-card transactions.
Overstock.com is one of the few large companies that retains some of its bitcoin. The online retailer, which began accepting bitcoin in January, keeps 10% of its revenue from bitcoin sales in the virtual currency even though those sales figures are falling short of projections.
The company, which originally predicted as much as $15 million in bitcoin sales revenue this year, now expects to generate just $3 million. It blames the shortfall on international sales that didn’t materialize.
“Volatility in bitcoin prices doesn’t say anything about the value of the underlying technology, which is a game-changer,” said Patrick Byrne, chief executive officer, in an interview.
Adam Penn didn’t want to worry about bitcoin’s wild price swings when he started accepting the virtual currency at his vegetarian diner last year, so he arranged to immediately convert all bitcoin payments to dollars.
The strategy means that he missed out on potential big profits when prices spiked last fall, but he has also been shielded from the recent rout.
“I don’t want to subject myself to that kind of stress,” said Mr. Penn, who owns Veggie Galaxy in Cambridge, Mass.
United Way Worldwide began accepting donations in bitcoin this fall, but “there is no way that we would take the financial risk” of holding on to the virtual currency, says Evan Hochberg, chief strategy officer at the nonprofit.
“There are people who are looking to make donations based on their passions for bitcoin and we wanted to engage that audience,” said Mr. Hochberg, explaining the charity’s reason for accepting bitcoin.
Mr. White says that Coinbase’s list of merchants is continuing to grow at a rate of 10% each month despite bitcoin’s recent price drop. The “vast majority” of them convert their bitcoin into dollars, he says.
Despite merchant reluctance to keep the bitcoin, accepting the digital currency “gets them involved in the bitcoin ecosystem and starts the ball rolling,” says Stephanie Wargo, vice president of marketing for BitPay Inc., an Atlanta firm that processes bitcoin transactions for merchants. She says the vast majority of BitPay’s U.S. customers choose to convert into dollars.
Jeffrey Egan, a 27-year-old digital marketing manager at a vineyard on New York’s Long Island, says he gravitates toward merchants that accept bitcoin for payment but finds it “perfectly understandable” that many of them don’t keep his bitcoin.
Mr. Egan says he has tried to convince his employer to accept the virtual currency by describing how the currency risk can be avoided, but so far hasn’t been successful.
The decision to accept bitcoin has been good for Reeds Jewelers, which is donating 5% of its holiday bitcoin sales to a charity that fights hunger. Since the jeweler started accepting bitcoin in June, Mr. Caan says bitcoin customers have been spending triple the amount being paid by customers who use old-fashioned cash or plastic.
At Mr. Penn’s Veggie Galaxy, the pace of bitcoin transactions has slowed by half in recent months to about one a week. But the owner, who usually hedges the currency’s risk, decided to keep about $10 worth of bitcoin he received from a business associate.
“It’s kind of fun just to have it, but I’m not expecting anything from it,” he said. “It’s not enough to worry about.”

“Why would anyone outside of a lunatic asylum want to hold money? What an insane use to put it! *For it is a recognized characteristic of money as a store of wealth that it is barren*; whereas *practically every other form of storing wealth* yields some interest or profit. “
–John Maynard Keynes
I love this quote because it animates how the founder of mainstream modern economic theory knew and understood fiat to be only AND exclusively a mode of exchange, NOT a storage of wealth. 
And there is also this one:
"Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become “profiteers,” who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery."

It's not halal microfinance, but islamic banking which is [massive, growing]( and hugely under represented segment of the digital banking sector. 
Islamic banking is actually the same kind of bank that the Nobel-prize winning Grameen Bank is, and frankly is one of the most power weapons against [petro-islam](
Bitcoin can create financial products that are essentially full-reserve which means there can exist an entirely new form of Islamic finance based on bitcoin.

Yes, but what is even more ridiculous is that people continue to believe that these idiots in government have our best interest at heart. Again, and again, no mater how many times throughout history we see people have their wealth robbed from them by their own governments, people still believe in these institutions. 
I hope bitcoin and digital currencies will remove the power of the purse from these sociopaths.

This sounds more or less like a shill for Prof. Yermack 2 day executive course on bitcoin
From the abstract of Prof. Yermack's April 2014 paper national bureau of economic research, found [here](
"A bona fide currency functions as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account, but bitcoin largely fails to satisfy these criteria. Bitcoin has achieved only scant consumer transaction volume, with an average well below one daily transaction for the few merchants who accept it. Its volatility is greatly higher than the volatilities of widely used currencies, imposing large short-term risk upon users. Bitcoin's daily exchange rates exhibit virtually zero correlation with widely used currencies and with gold, making bitcoin useless for risk management and exceedingly difficult for its owners to hedge. Bitcoin prices of consumer goods require many decimal places with leading zeros, which is disconcerting to retail market participants. Bitcoin faces daily hacking and theft risks, lacks access to a banking system with deposit insurance, and it is not used to denominate consumer credit or loan contracts. Bitcoin appears to behave more like a speculative investment than a currency."
Yeah, I'll pass.

I got to the the cover with Blythe Masters and the headline, "It's all about the blockchain" and then I puked in my mouth. Curious with the taste of bile in my mouth I powered on.
It was not worth it and I puked in my mouth twice more. Read at your own risk.

As someone who use to seize bank accounts as part of my job, I cannot tell you how laughable this is. 
The money that your VC friend has in the bank is not his; it's the banks. This is why I never needed any sort of a warrant to freeze bank accounts--just a few keys strokes and a friendly request from the local sheriffs department, and after that, not a dime of 'your' money can leave that bank account.
Sure you might 'know' it's there, but accessing it is a whole different story.

Oh shit, the price went up $6
This must be mainstream--I guess when states adopt bitcoin as their single currency we should see +$240, maybe even +$250!

Fun fact: The Bank of International Settlements was once a Nazi bank. It was used to launder gold from the Nazi conquest of Czechoslovakia, among other places. It was suppose to be liquidated, per the demands of the delegates at the brentton woods conference, and FDR approved its liquidation. However, Truman allowed for Keynes to convince him not to do it, and to use the resources to create the Bank of International Settlements. Because of that today the largest bank in the world, the central bank of the central banks is Nazi bank.
