A pretty average nuclear plant produces around 2,500 MW 
* 2,500MW = 2,500,000,000 Watts
The Antminer S9 is advertised as mining at a mere 0.01W/GH/s
* 2,500,000,000 / 0.01 = 250,000,000,000 GH/s
Which is 250,000,000 TH/s
So if you somehow had enough ASICs to max out the plants capacity you would be mining roughly 1,750 BTC per day at current difficulty.
With a cost of only 2.1 cents per KWh to run a nuclear power plant, you would be earning a profit of roughly $6.8m a day at current prices.
Yearly you'd be mining about 640,000 BTC and making a profit of $2.26B
You would also be contributing about 242,000,000 TH/s more than the entire rest of the bitcoin network, and have complete free reign to use the 51% attack. 
Lamborghini's all round.

Congratulations you've arrived at the dilemma being faced on whether to fork etc

It's astronomically cheap considering the features.
Go spend a few days reading about how the monetary system works and it will make sense.
Far too complex to explain in reddit comments.

No, these people are too stupid to understand that a woman who used the patent system and then sold her game for profit is not anti-capitalist. Do you really expect them to be even remotely able to comprehend things like the nuances of taxation.

That makes no sense, could you elaborate a bit? Why would it send your coins somewhere you haven't even asked it to?

It's very unlikely, but it would be possible in a situation where for example; traders &amp; institutions all pulled their funds to ride out the storm elsewhere, then BTC encountered problems on Aug 1st. It's far more likely it will go to $1k though, even that is a 'maybe', in truth no one can really predict the markets.

The entire point of bitcoin is that you don't need a bank anymore.
Storing bitcoin in a bank is called putting a Trezor in a safe deposit box.

How would one go about doing so?

Coinbase is cancer. They treat their users like shit, their service drops constantly  at every good buying opportunity and they make it as difficult as possible for users to withdraw funds.

A cashless economy just means an economy where the government can tax you for literally every thing you do.
Want to save money? There's now a tax for that.
Want to spend money? There's now a tax for that.
Want to invest? There's now a tax for that.
Want to cash out of an investment? Definitely a tax for 
Step out of line and we'll cut off your currency supply so you lose your house, can't feed yourself and your kids end up on the street. Better do what we say goyim!

Your beloved europe is currently being invaded by 3rd world rapists who murder your children, abuse your women and shit on your heritage, and you are paying for it with your wonderful socialist taxes.
PAHAHAHA, tell me more about how great it's going you fucking nerd.

Paypal held over $50,000 from a friend of mines business, during the middle of operations, and almost bankrupted him because he was unable to pay bills for his office rental etc.
They are renowned for doing this and it happens more frequently than most people realize. One of the worst companies on the internet.

I guess he was somewhat correct.

If anything this is good for you because it means there is now a void which you could fill, and get rich doing so, it's called entrepreneurship.

Just generate a paper wallet.
If BTC forks, your coins will exist and be accessible on both chains with the same set of keys.

This is the only right answer

Socialism is implemented in the name of the poor or the 'workers', but the result of socialism (or even wealth redistribution) is always an excuse to seize wealth from the goyim.

Our legal system is a cancer upon society.
Taking our best and brightest young minds, at the forefront of technological advancement, and locking them in a cage.
Absolute degeneracy.

This could be cool, if BTC plummets back to 2 or even 3 figure prices there could be a whole new round of cryptomillionaires when a healthy price is restored. I think we could see a drop to $500 by Aug 1st.
