No, we can have both.
When Lightning and Liquid are ready, the underlying protocol will act as a settlement layer, while users can have quick and cheap transactions on top of that - so Bitcoin behaves like a currency.

Just tested it, seems great! Keep up the good work!

I agree, good work from Core here.

That was 8 years ago. Things change, get over it. We cannot scale on-chain, that's a fact.

Seems like some Classic shills trying to force a panic sale. Guess someone having a huge short atm.

We don't really need VCs pumping even more money into it, there are enough companies working on Bitcoin already.
I say: Let them work.

I agree. As long as I am not affected, I consider this FUD.

Of course it will be practical for small micropayments - once Lightning and Liquid are ready.
Bitcoin can't scale on-chain, that's why Satoshi also implemented the 1MB limit. You are just quoting him out of context.

Still, it's easier and more efficient with Lightning and Liquid.

Will take some time, but meanwhile we will get SegWit for the short-term increase.

No, Bitcoin is still a currency.
But there is technical proof that the underlying protocol does not scale, so it will have to act as a settlement layer. Does not have anything to do with Bitcoin being a currency or not though.

Where did you buy the coins?
Seems like you got scammed.

I don't think the proposal is that bad. It surely has it's purpose.
@_date: 2016-03-14 18:05:51
FUD and should be removed.
@_date: 2016-03-03 18:12:20
Anyone still taking this guy seriously?
I think we should let Core handle this, there proposals make much more sense. After Segwit gets deployed, we can talk (if there is still a need for a further increase and Lightning is not ready yet).

Thanks dude!
