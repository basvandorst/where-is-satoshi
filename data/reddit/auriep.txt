That data is from bitcoinity. I presume if the other exchanges weren't negligible, they'd probably be on there.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:25:19
Wow, just looked through it and coinsquare is actually making up ground. That's not a negligible share anymore by the looks of it. Good call.

Personally, I don't think funding it would be that big of a challenge.
Putting a competent team together that can execute the business and handle the technical and security concerns is probably the hard part.

I'll check them out again. Looked like they needed some work last I checked. Doesn't look like they're doing much volume still.
The industry is in its infancy but has still been around for almost a decade. QCX is far from an infant. 
Not the biggest fan of American companies like Amazon or Coinbase/GDAX dominating CAD books. We want Canadian companies to create Canadian jobs, pay Canadian corporate taxes, and give us Canadian banking benefits.
I do hope QCX does improve, but I still think the market is too centralized around them and that is not healthy for the system as a whole, imo.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:22:20
I hear you. Personally, I don't see a lot of value with the current ICO model, which is to make it anything but a security imo. 
I think blockchain securities would be awesome, and we probably get there eventually. The legal implications of that today, however, might make it unfeasible. I don't know enough about it.

Usually, I find crowdfunding to be more effort than its worth, but maybe something like this could garner some broader interest without shilling the hell out of it.
Doing something on a Canadian version of  might be worth considering. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:21:10
Yeah but no intelligent investor will fund a business without a core founding team that can competently execute the business plan.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:08:57
I'm not suggesting Canada will have a big exchange on the global scale. We can improve the market share we currently have though imo.
Further, though I don't doubt an American company could dominate the exchange space one day, I think it's unhealthy for one exchange to dominate the Canadian market, as it does today. 
Though foreign exchanges will certainly compete well for any Canadian BTC business, the competitiveness of the exchange market in Canada is non-existent and we all suffer because of it.  
If you don't want to do BTCCAD business at QCX, what option do you have? You're better to move to USD and do BTCUSD business imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:11:20
Where are you based? 
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:31:53
7404 looking like the big level for OKC BTCCNY spot.  Think it's the 2013 1D ATH close. Range opens up above and have never held it for 72 hours. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:43:09
I'm just quoting spot levels at OKC, which is still a big destination. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:39:43
The 2013 1D ATH close does not matter?
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:20:04
Tell me about it. Banjos to bitcoin. The Alberta Trailer Company. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:00:52
Sweet. 
Did anyone hear anything about ATCO in Canada announcing a BTC mining facility partnership? They're a big utility and power transmission company in Alberta. 
Must be doing something similar minus the farm. Would be awesome if anyone has a link or more info. Just heard through the grapevine the other day. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:12:09
Alberta is pretty progressive with alt energy these days. Wouldn't surprise me at all, we have tons of excess. 
Heard it from a senior manager in the power transmission division. He don't even know what blockchain is so I know he didn't dream it up. 
Not seeing anything official yet though...

How aggressive are you? If you have the risk tolerance and horizon to hold, why not start averaging? 
Market timing is one of the most difficult things to do. On the broadest horizon, probably just splitting hairs on current prices if you think there's a lot upside in the tank.
OTOH, if you're concerned about downside, you could watch a weekly chart for a retest and support of local lows. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:38:13
Awesome! Was one of the longer posts I've wrote. Glad to hear you made it through :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:43:12
Haha Steve gets all the upvotes. Striking similarities to his life story and Bitcoin investors �� �� �� 
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:40:42
Absolutely. Can't forget institutions either which continue to file in.
Still have to catch up but glad to see the government take a definitive stance. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, I guess?
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:02:13
I don't think this analysis hinges on the fact of 6k being the bottom. I just grabbed that because it was the low when I published. 
That said, we must be getting close. That was a fast and sharp rout that should have cleared plenty of overleveraged money. Still lots of Oct buyers chasing highs that have gone unscathed. 
With the 100B market cap institutional floor at 6K though, not sure we'll make it back down there.
Keep an eye out for my next piece for more TA related commentary on current ranges.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:07:21
Haha hey, we all know TA does not work. Can we not just appreciate the visual beauty from 1 year of patterns jammed into one chart? That was something.
I did break down each drawing and indicator in a post linked in the thread for anyone dying to know.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:57:08
Perfect. Maybe just semantics but thought those were ways of scaling the network.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:30:55
Thanks for the kind words. I'll have to take a look.

I understand I can dump (hopefully) most of these coins for Bitcoin, but outside of that...
I do see Clashic though! If there was one I was going to hodl...

It's hard to suss this out with all the different exchanges and the shoddy ways to count volume but I have a theory about this that I talked about over a year ago  
I think it has to do with a huge supply of bitcoins being accumulated for under $100. These people have been distributing for profit since the ATH and are still at it. They dump whenever they can into strong bids but supply still exceeds demand. It explains the long, 'orderly' decline and extended periods of consolidation. Clearly they're trying to maintain the best average prices. 
This trend will predictably continue until you see 'exhaustion'. That happens when you see *extreme* volume on the daily+ ranges on *extremely* tight spreads. It's a pattern that illustrates demand overtaking supply. 
This is all really a demonstration in market making imo. Watch for massive selling met by support and you'll find retail confidence flood back in. That's what drives the booms.
**Edit:** spelling
@_date: 2015-04-30 17:01:03
I don't think it's fair to say people don't think it's a valuable investment. 
Average people just aren't willing to pay 250 for one bitcoin. It's supposed to be a currency but what currency have you seen that acts even remotely close to this? Look at BTC in it's early days when the order book was stacked with penny spreads. Get back to that and you'll find the retail buyers. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:04:09
Agreed, but what about micropayments? 
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:59:24
A better way to think of this is to look at the order book depth at any given time. You can see how much money it would take to move the price at any time and how far. Relative to volume in the period you're looking at, you can determine if the book is thin or thick and how much volatility to expect. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:38:04
Big news seeing the predictors of the world take a shot on BTC. 
The only thing wrong with bitcoin is that it's too expensive for the average joe. The volume is indication of solid market participation it's just all on the sell side. 
We'll find the buyers eventually. Last time I looked they were last seen somewhere between 50-100. With all the adoption and investment, could find them a bit higher this time around. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 12:20:50
Wow. DAO bank anyone?

Volume looked bullish from here on the 4h plus. Solid effort on huge range.
