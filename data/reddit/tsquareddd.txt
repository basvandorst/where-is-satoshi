Thanks for the reply! No risk = no reward! 
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:05:33
Most asked question Hahah
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:42:22
Thanks! Seems like 2 diffrent story's But i checked and Indeed its nothing like BTC. I think Litecoin is more like Bitcoin. Always good to stack some Ripple and just hodl it for a couple of years. Im a long term hodler
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:41:55
People come here and think They get rich over night. One big dip comes and everyone panics. Oh boy, If getting rich was this easy then everyone would be rich.
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:21:36
Man, it seems when browsing Reddit that a lot of people are involved already but we are still in the early fase. So many people still Dont know what BtC is let alone the people actually investing. You are still party of the early adopters so take your chances and be part of this group! In 3-5 years it would be a shame If the price of BTC went up 10x and that you missed the boat. Hope this gave you Some motivation!
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:16:45
Why Not If I may ask? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:51:29
I was like, take the LTC! But then you shot it:( Good game bro! I like it
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:31:16
People losing milions, then we got this guy.
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:17:21
This question is like going into a bar and asking If You should get a drink
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:21:22
What a time to be alive
@_date: 2017-07-07 06:43:54
Yo bro! Koop wat Litecoin in :)
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:32:33
We are still in the early fase of adoption. Maybe in the future when BTC will get bigger and adopted by banks that there will be a better system. For now, keep your investments private. That why everyone says that you should not reveal how much you invested like a lot of people do here on Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:41:45
All hop on the rollercoaster! Were going up up up!
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:54:21
This is not the fault of Bitcoin is it?
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:51:44
Why Ripple tho? Can you explain? Thankyou!
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:52:16
If it falls, hodl and buy more, summer sale!
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:46:02
Same thing happend on litebit.eu during the day.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:23:08
Thanks Doc.
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:12:49
Im not sure but I think you have to start forgetting about them... They in Limbo now.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:04:59
I wouldnt tbh. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:43:18
Never heard of his investment after that short video, maybe he didnt hodl
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:31:01
People or companys with a lot of money manipulating the market he means. Like 1Mil+
@_date: 2017-07-15 05:00:14
If youre in for the long term, yes. Long term hodlers dont really mind the couple of € up or down. They see the big picture. If your in for the short therm then also yes. Dont try to predict the market, you'll fail. This is a good 'dip' now to start buying. Goodluck!
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:33:54
Team VTC! (Unfortunatly pretty undervalued
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:36:06
Yeh this topic will prob get lost in limbo. Too bad! Noobs
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:29:59
Thanks for the explenation! I never really focused on ripple because i thought it was already mature and That it wouldnt grow anymore. Thankyou for this tip ill look into it and prob Invest some! Spread the chances right. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:32:16
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:04:18
Thats true man! Its your game so make it however You like. Keep us up to date! Goodluck
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:04:40
Buy now. Dont wait for a good moment because no one can predict what is going to happen. Take your chances and you will be rewarded!
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:50:28
$3050 next week
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:39:28
Dont understand that part either. Seems like if people cant come up with anything to 'attack' you, they start talking about your Reddit age. Kinda childish tbh.
@_date: 2017-07-11 17:56:16
Trezor masterrace!
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:56:29

I think you are still able to buy Bitcoins on litebit.eu, i know that BTCDirect and Bitonic will not sell any BTC during those days. Greeting from your neighbour Holland!
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:24:48
Ill get the popcorn! Game on my friend and lets enjoy the ride!
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:18:40
We believe in something that could be the future and therfore we take the risk and Invest our money in it. We know we can lose it all within a day but without Any risk, there will be no gains.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:07:36
Maybe litebit.eu? Not Sure If They accept Paypal But I Always use them
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:16:47
Sorry for your loss. Hopefully you learned from your mistake haha
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:55:19
Yes ofc people. Robots and dogs are not into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:11:54
Nu heb je je drop! 42-43
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:06:11
Honestly man, i see some good information on here but its also important to say that it depens on how much are you willing to risk (and lose). Yes you can try to risk it for the biscuit and succeed, but maybe the third time you will lose and you will have to start over again. If you have a good daily job and this is your side business and dont mind losing 1000+, then you can atleast try. Then atleast you can tell yourself you tried. But personally i would just buy, Hodl and buy the dips. In the end you will gain (like you said maybe 1 BTC will go to 10k within 2-3 years) and you will not risk anything. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:44:56
Will it go down that much?
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:13:23
In welke winkel staat ie in Amsterdam? Even kijkje nemen.

Hallo mede Nederlander! (Was Btw een bug van Litebit, de prijs is niet echt zoveel gedaald in een paar minuten tijd).
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:01:05
I think the prise will rise because there are less coins for sell and more people that wanna buy before they miss the boat (not sure, just what I think)
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:16:56
You can also try to use the search bar. Its been explained a lot the last couple of weeks what is going on...
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:24:03
Hahah Maybe make a mode for LTC fans, mode for ETH fans etc.  
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:18:42
Any idea what time things will get fun for Europe?
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:38:18
Supply and demand. If there is no supply but huge demand... 
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:32:39
I have to agree with you but Im Not sure we will see a uptrend for the rest of the year. Heard that in November there will be Again Some chaos?
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:49:00
Ofc Not multi. I Dont support BCC. I was Just curious cuz im also new to Reddit as you can see. Just trying to learn here.
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:15:56

@_date: 2017-07-25 08:42:17
In Holland the police also seized 1000 Bitcoins of a criminal and they said in the news that the police Will keep them. So they were not planning on selling them. Maybe they will use it for undercover ops. Not sure.
