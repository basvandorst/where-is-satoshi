I'm kinda disappointed that very few people are actually contributing :( I've sent mine 1 hour ago and there are only 3 new donations since then...

I'm sorry but what about the rest? I mean the stuff people were sending just before or during the match to both addresses (17jSa... / 1MirY...)? Please don't get me wrong - I'm just curious as the account says there are still 2.934994 BTC in there...

For me the whole "save esports" thing is kinda silly. Quake 1 has been "saved" by John Carmack by making the game open source. Community improved clients and servers just like they wanted, making it extremely "esport friendly".
Just imagine what would happen if Blizzard did the same with StarCraft 1. Today you can't even have widescreen support and the game looks terribly bad because the code is closed and Blizzard is not interested in SC1 anymore.
