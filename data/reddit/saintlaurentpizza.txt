Buy low, buy high. Buy now, buy later. If you know it'll rise, grab your balls and ride the rollercoaster !!!

I loved the detailed explanation of AI &amp; Robots. But you didn’t dig deeper into Kambria &amp; left me on a cliff hanger!

Agreed. But certainly nothing is forever. The future is crazy and anything can happen!

Is the dollar going to live forever?
No one knows these questions. Only time will tell.

very fool proof
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:29:05
That's the spirit
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:03:56
Please! Been wondering since I saw it hit below 4K.
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:37:07
LOL

I simply see it as some people just can handle more of a gamble. Some like to sleep sound asleep night knowing it can crash tomorrow &amp; be *fine.* But like OP said, with high risks come high rewards and nothing but respect for those who use the system against it self to make themselves money.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:37:23
Hey if it hit from 3 to 20 in 2017 ya never know man
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:23:48

Imagine how long this guy had to wait to make the payment and only to realize it was the wrong address!
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:24:34
Imagine what if it went to the wrong address ��
@_date: 2017-10-08 03:28:02
I had $50 invested at the time of the drop but didn't sell any, wishing I purchased and now I know for the future!
