You described people paying over the odds with credit cards. There are no fees associated with NFC terminals. Whatever the merchant charges is all that is paid. So Plutus' reward system is actually a rebate. And it can be spent anywhere as opposed to just on certain items in a scheme. It's cheaper to use than cash.

There's no such thing as censorship resistance. It's just a question of choosing who you'd rather be censored by. If you use Paypal it can censor you whether it be of its own accord or under dictat by governments. If you use Bitcoin, you're hoping you're not censored by a mining cartel or a community DAO-style chain re-org. Pick your poison.

Decent shout. 
My hope is - I'm actually setting up a NGO to advocate for such a thing - that this ledger would be so general purpose that the idea that governments would harass the guardians of the ledger to shut it down because of criminal use, would be akin to preventing ISPs from allowing users acess the internet or digging up the wires that people use to connect to each other - nonsensical.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, et al, are what people call them. You call ETH a new altcoin because of your ideology, others call it the original ETH. There's no men with guns to settle this dispute, ergo public blockchains aren't fit for any serious purpose. They are destined to be an eternal political mess.

There is the possibility of independent oracles that earn tokens for auditing code. If it's in their interests to audit it correctly, they'll audit it correctly. Just like miners in Bitcoin. 
I think you need to understand that anything is possible with Ethereum. Literally any type of contract can be programmed. Any potential trust problem you think of can be resolved by creating a DAO to police it.

@_date: 2016-03-02 18:05:13
You're right and have touched on the essence of my point. Attack Bitcoin or Ethereum and you possibly destroy the value of the token. Attack Bitcoin to attack Rootstock and you could possibly steal assets of far greater value than bitcoin. And these assets may continue to maintain value after the attack. The situation is very different. 
The same risk applies to attacking Ethereum to steal other assets secured on its chain such as tokens that are redeemable for gold let's say. I did see an interesting piece by the guys behind Maker Dao recently though saying that they are planning to implement their own validation security that means even in the even of a successful attack on the base protocol, one cannot steal their meta-assets.

It is very real. Most Bitcoiners are right that you want your base protocol decentralised, hence the no to XT. But what you also want is your base protocol to have smart contracting abilities to ensure true trustless interoperability between any other chains (such as side chains) that may want to interact with the base layer. 
You don't want a situation where the sidechain you want to secure (Rootstock) is more useful than the base layer (Bitcoin). Security nightmare.

I'm with u/haroldtimmings. Accountable, regulated, trusted third parties beat the shit out of game theory. Since the system scales there'd be little in the way to disagree on bar monetary policy and even then they wouldn't fork and destroy the good thing they've got going - just like miners don't selfish mine even though they can.
One could say govs would shut them down but the cat's out of the bag. They know a POW/POS solution will pop up if they take it down. If privacy is baked in you'd get a very high level of censorship resistance in any event. You can't censor a TX you know nothing about.

@_date: 2017-02-20 11:25:30
Just thinking about this some more, the way to reduce the likelihood of government censorship would be to ensure the ledger administrators don't have any involvement with currency at all. They would merely be guardians of the ledger. And this ledger may have many non-financial use cases too. It wouldn't be merely a money services business in the eyes of the law. 
Anyone would be able to issue currency on this ledger, - including fiat - according to whatever monetary policy, or governance system they wish, and the admins would merely keep copies of a ledger.
I read Mintettes again. He really called Bitcoin's/blockchain's failings early on. Fascinating discussion on his blog here too.  Very prescient comments relating to impossibility of network upgrades and unsustainability of POW in terms of cost/security ratio. 
The big question here is how one would choose admins. Organisations like the EFF and P2P Foundation stand out for starters.

In agreement with your first two points but bitcoin is still a cryptocurrency. It's not suited to day-to-day use but is an excellent currency for settlement (security, immutability). So it's still very much a crypto-currency/asset. If it's not, what on earth is it?

I never mentioned LN but to take up your point, it absolutely does apply to LN. That's why only crypto issued by central banks on the blockchain or crypto pegged to the value of the local Fiat currency will likely be the only viable option until governments cop on and change their approach. Since governments want to control money however, this is more a hope than an expectation. 
There are two DAOs on the "Other Protocol" called String Finance and Maker DAO that are attempting to overcome (or more aptly circumvent) the regulatory problem.

Not true. It's subject to VAT and CGT in most jurisdictions. It's an accounting nightmare to use it as cash. This coupled with the fact one has to incur costs in obtaining it, pass KYC protocols in obtaining it and be subject to volatility. All that's fine if you're using it for settlement. For day-to-day use, it's not viable.

In fairness to him, he says bitcoin, the currency, will not succeed because of government interference. It's nothing to do with the technology. He's changed his tune from a few years ago when he rubbished it. Now he's using regulatory reasons. And this time he has a point. Governments allow the use of cash within their borders but allowing enormous sums of it travel across borders is not something they're going to allow. We're in dream land if we think otherwise.

That's the biggest pile of nonsense I've read in a while :) 
You say the history of the Ethereum ledger was changed and then go on to say Blockchains are immutable. I know already your response will be that Ethereum Classic remained immutable but that's also nonsense as an unchanged database doesn't matter if there's another different version of it out there that more people subscribe to. 
Game theory in anarchy guarantees absolutely nothing but the various interest groups the game theory creates squabbling online. Ergo Bitcoin will never amount to anything beyond being a vehicle for people to buy drugs or extort people online as they're the only people who would accept the risk this political instability ensures.

Yes so the largest interest group decides as per. What do you think of auto-updates that can only be pushed with a multsig security ceremony in order to prevent different versions existing?

@_date: 2016-11-25 11:46:54
I should have made clear that my point is rooted in the belief that the assumption that there wouldn't be a long-tail of implementation adoption amongst competing implementations, is a poor one. Better to have a long-tail where all eyes are on one family of implementations as opposed to several families. Critical failures are far less likely. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 10:39:03

@_date: 2016-02-25 12:26:18
I really like sidechains tech but because of the security model, I think it's far better suited to private and consortium blockchains as opposed to public smart contracting. If I want privacy and control, I use a sidechain (or Eris or hyperledger). If I want interoperable trustless smart contracts, I use Ethereum.
If you look at Blockstream's and Eris' partners versus the pletora of dApps by unknown developers that are being built on Ethereum, it's clear the space is developing this way as well. There'll be competing systems. The current financial system will become much more efficient. Some people like delegating control. They like having somebody to answer to them, even if it costs them financially. And that's fine. On Ethereum a system is being built for self-sovereignty. For people who wish to have complete control. If things go wrong they'll have little recourse and taking care of their finances will involve much more personal involvement, but they'll have absolute sovereignty over their future. This is the trade-off. You choose what works best for you.

Don't take it totally literally as the theory was conceived outside of an anarchical setting but I believe it to be analogous as governance disputes in Bitcoin lead to a situation where technological progress is halted - the resource is underused. 
If Bitcoin is unduly focused on a clarity of rights, it may be the obsession with absolute consensus. Such a focus makes things impossible to get things done in large disparate groups.

Don't use a fractional reserve bank then. It's a free world. Your money won't appreciate if people aren't spending it by the way because then nobody would be demanding it. For someone to acquire it to save, it requires somebody else to spend it.

Your post shows the common misconception of why banks exist. Exerpt from a blog post I'm currently writing: 
"In the field of finance, compliance costs, for good reason, are the foremost concern to most businesses. Even in this case however, the blockchain doesn’t assist in arbitraging the vast majority of these costs because our financial system is founded on trust and promises that will always exist external to the blockchain. Borrowing and lending are indisputably the most efficient ways to reconcile inefficient resource allocation in an economy resulting from some people’s desire to save and other people’s desire to spend. The division of labour and economies of scale mean that centralising these transactions in a heavily regulated fractional reserve bank is in turn the most efficient way to do this. Private banks facilitating this activity expose themselves to risk, even when heavily regulated, and in the event this risk is miscalculated a lender of last resort is required for when market conditions create systemic risk. History has shown us that a lender of last resort is more effective at its job if it is the creator of the money it is lending so long as it acts responsibly. A similar system of promises, regulatory oversight and rights exist in the area of commercial fundraising through stock issuance. The myriad of other financial contracts that exist are all built atop these systems of rights and promises and are thus beholden to its guarantees. There is nothing the blockchain can do to prevent people from borrowing, lending, fundraising or issuing equity – nor should it – or assist in any way in the case of systemic risk. Only the nation state can enforce these contracts and safeguard the system."

Have you seen Corda? Here's what they say about Ethereum:
" However, the term “contract” in Ethereum refers to an instantiation of a program that is replicated and maintained by every participating node. This instantiation is very much like an object in an Object Oriented program: it can receive and send messages, update local storage and so on.  In contrast, our implementation of the smart contract in code refers to a set of functions, only one of which is a part of keeping the system synchronised (the verify function). That function is pure and stateless (i.e., it may not interact with any other part of the system whilst executing). As contracts do not have any kind of mutable storage, there is no notion of a “message”. "
It basically claims most of the contract logic doesn't need to be on-chain at all - sharded or not sharded. If I understand it correctly.

Hi mate, you're not alone in thinking this. Ian Grigg makes similar noises. What I can't figure out however is how you can implement trustless p2p contracts without a blockchain. Corda works when ID and trust is established in a consortium. You talk about anchoring proofs in the blockchain analogous to how only proofs are synced in a consortium using Corda. But can you enlighten me how, for example, Augur would work trustlessly by simply anchoring proofs in the blockchain. Does it not still need a sidechain or does it merely require a p2p database of contracts that are anchored to the blockchain?

It's a hack. Bitcoin wasn't designed for something like that. As a result it's slow, insecure and impossible to have a light client.

It only forces them to buy things that are better stores of value which they use for savings. They don't have to go out and buy a new BMW. You want money to be both attractive to spend and most importantly be a good unit of account. The store of value element of money is only important in that its decline in value is predictable.

Since Colu did it for Bitcoin, I'm guessing it's possible (non-coder here). Corda is only built with financial applications in mind though so maybe there are use cases that require all the logic to be executed on a blockchain. What are they though? In regards to coloured coins, physical goods don't suffer from the double spend problem so why blockchain?

Once ZCash is up and running I think we'll see most other protocols start to implement privacy. I know Ethereum is already on the case with ring signatures and HAWK implementation in the pipeline.

What Ethereum has proven is that a 51% attack can occur on a blockchain. The issue was known before the hard fork and is a general one to all blockchains secured by Nakamoto consensus. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 22:33:48
Nonsense. We're not talking about a fractional reserve bank. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 07:12:51
All sentiments in this article equally apply to all blockchains secured by Nakamoto consensus. Bitcoin included. A majority rule reversion can occur at any time. We knew this before the hard fork. It's not news. Great piece and I fully agree with the analysis. 
So if Nakamoto conensus alone isn't enough to prevent a 51% attack, which blockchain communities are innovating to prevent such attacks? 
ZCash, Monero, Ethereum are a couple that spring to mind. Greg Maxwell has done some work on confidential transactions but that's only intended for a sidechain I believe. That's not enough to prevent one on the main chain and this makes me pessimistic for Bitcoin. Culture has never been enough to ensure the survival of an institution. Unbreakable rules are what's required.
