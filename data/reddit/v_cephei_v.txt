I got into Bitcoin because of Reddit. I remember seeing a post on the frontpage "New alltime high 6000 $", a couple day later "New alltime high 6500 $".
And i started thinking "hmm maybe you can still make money with Bitcoin". Now im sitting here dreaming of buying a appartment/house, something that would have been absolutely impossible before i discovered Bitcoin.

How exactly does a paper wallet work? 
Is it just a piece of paper that has an adress/amount/private key on it? If so, how is it safe, because the company who prints it could know all the information. And how would i get access to Bitcoin stored on a paper wallet?

Id love something like this with the rollercoaster bitcoin guy, angeling itself depending on how big the green/red numbers are, that would be cool. No numbers just angle.

If there where only 3 things a avarage person must know about Bitcoin so he can claim he understands Bitcoin, what would those 3 things be?

Found in the comment section on [traidingview.com]( from a trader called mc\_pewee:
This is what my tinfoil hat says about this situation, in steps. 
Cause Tether FUD, and pump Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin pump and Tether falling causes people to panic buy Bitcoin. 
People panic buying Bitcoin allows the whales to slowly dump extremely expensive BTC for extremely cheap tether. 
People panic buying high price Bitcoin with cheap tether means they bought high and sold low. 
Whales slowly dumping BTC at the top for cheap Tether means they get extra 15% BTC when they buy back in. 
On Bitmex at least, we just got rejected on a reattempt to break meme triangle. 
CBOE futures close on Wed. Queue price dump "b/c meme triangle was denied." 
CBOE futures close low as hell, around $6,100, $6,200 or so. (Look what happened on the last CBOE expiration) 
People panic sell their FALLING Bitcoin back into tether thus inflating Tether's price back to normal or higher than before. (Or other stablecoins) 
We go slowly sideways but down for the next 2 days after CBOE, queue all the bears posting we break $6k. 
On Friday October 19th, 2018, the golden bullrun we've all been waiting for starts. 
After 1 fake down, 1 fake up, 1 fake down, whales manage to acquire a SHITLOAD of pumped stablecoins (Especially tether because rumor has it deposits are being reopened on Finex in the next few days.) 
Friday, October 19th, 2018: 
COBINHOOD offers zero trading fees margin trading with 3x leverage for the following pairs: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, COB/ETH. 
Get ready to get your longs in for BTC around $5,900 or $6k or so. 
Herding techniques, guys ;)

This is what a lot of people think. And because of that, i think the opposite will happen. Bear-Whales gonna shit on peoples expectations again.

Is it possible, that this rise is a artificially generated bubble in between bull-markets?
Big players creating a bubble that pops, so they get another chance to buy cheap once regulation are finally in place (ETF and shit)

Since Microsoft announced they´re planning a idendity verification thing utilizing the bitcoin blockchain. Do you guys think, that all the "special purpose cryptos" will die out?
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:30:35
i meant if Microsoft can build something for idendity verification, you can build many other things for different purposes to.

Probably because Roger Wright is buying his own shitcoin.

I thought someone once said he created a fork called "Bitcoin Core" just to fuck with Ver an his puppets?
@_date: 2019-01-25 11:49:15
BCH is a Hard fork from BTC. But the BCH people tell everyone it is THE Bitcoin, not a fork. So they´re dellusional liars who can´t accept that BTC is Bitcoin and BCH is Bitcoin Cash. A lot of lies, alot of fraud around BCH, thats why no one likes them.

I know we dont want/need an ETF, but will the government shutdown delay the SEC decision?

I dont feel so good Mr. Mc Affee...

Yeah, so embarrassing to see the xrpeasants spam every crypto related tweet.

BSV is a bcash fork. You need to look at BCH not BTC to claim your garbage.
