really? No body just sits on the bitcoins on the website?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:40:30
mtgox problem?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:33:15
short answer: YES!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:10:05
doesn't matter, whenever you hit the button to buy nothing happens anymore. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:24:37
I don't smoke illegal things, or legal ones!
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:21:59
uhh it's still plummeting

   OPERATION APRIL FOOLSCOIN
Targets: MtGox, BTCE, Bitcoin24, Bitstamp
Mission statement:
The recent sell-off was only partially successful for several reasons:
- Fresh blood looking to buy
- Overly bullish market
- Only one exchange targeted
April 1st occurs at the end of a bank holiday, fiat will be running low on the exchanges and it is the perfect time for a secondary strike. A triple bluff will be used to trick the market into collapse.
- Stage 1: Slowly buy BTC, use accounts to spread bullish propaganda on all major channels; bitcointalk, reddit, twitter, etc.
- Stage 2:  Dump 10k on Gox, and 1K on all other exchanges.
- Stage 3: Put buy orders in below the final sale price to profit from the panic sellers.
- Stage 4: When price rebounds to within 5% of the original price dump all remaining coins.
- Stage 5: DDoS all exchanges and spread negative propaganda on forums.
- Stage 6: Send the pre-made press releases to selected news outlets.
We got it this time.
Meet on IRC at the designated time and be prepared for a late night.

I was just trying to get something to work as mining, it's the only one i've been able to get to work and have 'coins' appear in my wallet! I wish i could be mining ppcoins right now or something. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:39:46
yep, it did, so now how do i say.. trasnfer the few btc's the bitcoinbot gave me for my karma to my actual wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:26:01
you wait till it reaches the bottom good sir!
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:37:43
all the way down!
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:21:15
think i'm just going to buy a shit ton of marijuana penny stocks. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:05:53
Has anyone ever done that bitinstant to get money on mtgox fast? i'm about to head down to a CVS to try and buy my first bitcoins lol 
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:12:08
i have been following ddd for weeks, just opened up my first account with scottrade and was thinking about putting the albeit small amount of money i have in it and sony(sne). 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:30:35
yes and yes i installed it, still synchronizing with network
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:19:21
same boat! 1.3btc hope they are worth something someday!  i want to buy in more when it's low but i spent that near 300 dollars as my throwaway money, spending anything more feels to much like a gamble with funds i could do something with. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:20:05
you can though,  bitinstint &gt; cvs &gt; drive to cvs, use debit card. money is in your account before you make the drive back home. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:45:59
so i need to try and buy at the impending low point!
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:22:53
it would be nice to be able to sell it and buy back more when it really drops, or just hold on to it till one day it's worth something, i don't think bitcoin is going anywhere, i just wish i had more than 1 for when it does sometime, however it's too much of an incredible hassle to purchase them at the moment. I don't think i'll sell for a loss though. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:33:31
Cause I'm just kind of an all or nothing kind of guy, good idea though
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:00:54
i just hope they tip up to 190 where i bought in the first time. my coins will be auto sold and i can then buy back in when it dips again. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:39:02
lol this website is ridiculously bad
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:07:02
so i should buy 1 bitcoin now?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:07:17
pop! and 20 minute lag means you can't even get out quickly!!
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:40:43
I haven't ordered one yet, i've been mining freicoins cause that's the only thing i've figured out how to actually get to work with cgminer, at like 250mh/s i get about 10 every couple hours
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:42:18
how do you buy bitcoins?? is bitfloor safe?  i downloaded the bitcoin wallet off of primary bitcoin site, but where is my wallet now? it let's me add address and what not..
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:19:29
which means you can't even get out if you want to and who knows how far down it will be in 20 minutes!!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:37:08
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:45:23
i hope it does, i'm waiting to buy my first bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:44:17
i'm having no problems using mtgox right now?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:45:41
idk, i bought in, got my 1.3 bitcoins, think i'll just sit on them till it ever gets up to like 300+ or the thousands, or just let them rot in hell, w/e
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:58:00
over 1000 now
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:47:19
i want to tip them all! dangit. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:08:53
lol you spelled it wrong and there is already a subreddit for it!
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:56:05
yep, they down! KAboom!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:46:43
how are you suppose to buy when it takes 4 hours?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:26:26
what website is this?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:35:28
i was able to get that bot to send me funds to that wallet and then send those funds to another place, like .20 cents but hey i think i got it figured out, but i guess i don't need that at all since i have money on mtgox right now and can buy and sell all there till i'm filthy rich then transfer it all to my bank account gg!
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:53:36
I think the if part was all inferred by my starting the sentence off with, 'i just hope'
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:39:25
considering you have about 30 minutes of sell orders backed up right now, i'd wait atleast an hour and see where it's at. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:33:17
it's nearly impossible to get them and harder to get your money back without all sorts of fee's. Everywhere i look to buy bitcoins they want me to use another site like dwolla to transfer with another site to that site then use another site to transfer back to then transfer to my bank account, are you all really going through all that???
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:51:49
too late, 35 minutes of selling is about to occur at the very very least.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:00:32
how are all these people making coins with satoshi dice? the website is just blank?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:24:22
man it's like playing counter-strike back in 1998!
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:50:04
well i just waited an hour and saved 45 bucks, so i can continue to watch and see if it starts to generally swing up
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:12:50
So it's just like they say, walk up to the service desk and fill that stuff out/they'll know what to do? shows up within an hour?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:11:22
me too man! i'm sitting waiting for this day to end and clean up some cheap ones. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:40:56
uhh.. isn't this like.. good for you man? you're going to be able to make that bitcoin investment wayyyy cheaper than you were planning on 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:30:27
hehe silly that's what credit cards are for. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:17:45
but i have monies i don't know what to do with!
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:42:26
Ouch indeed, i'm trying to buy my first bitcoin right now and i can't find anywhere to do it at the moment. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:05:37
POP and 20 minutes till you can get out, dun dun
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:05:05
what happens in 10 hours?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:22:22
mhm ! =D i'll buy like 4 freaking bit coins!
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:05:49

@_date: 2013-04-17 21:33:57
