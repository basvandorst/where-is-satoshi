Not when it was just considered a "purchase". No fees to buy things on a credit card, especially if the balance is paid in full each month. 
Edit: Wait, did you mean a "Coinbase fee"?  I don't use CB - sorry, if so.

Picture this...merchants give a 1% discount to people paying with BTC instead of credit cards...even with the .2% fee (or whatever it is, as long as it's less than 1%), the buyer pays less, the merchant doesn't pay the 3% credit card processing fee, AND the purchase is irreversible.

He's not exactly saying "I was wrong". He's saying he "regrets" it because they likely saw lots of account closures and social media backlash. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:33:11
A lower stock price should never actually "help" an ETF, especially this GBTC Trust (which is most definitely NOT "basically an ETF for Bitcoin"). If the lower price does push the demand higher, it will do nothing more than INCREASE the premium that is already troubling. I do understand where you are coming from though, there was just a lot of misleading information in your comments. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:56:24

You don't have to be considered an "investor" to be "entitled" to it. After all, SS and other programs like Welfare and Medicaid are called "entitlements". I would argue that SS was not designed to be based on current taxation to pay the current receipents as well. I'm sure they originally wanted enough funds to actually pay the future bills without the program collapsing. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:36:35
I understand his point about consumers not "paying" at the point of sale to use a credit card but I disagree with the fact that a small fee can't be overcome with a little ingenuity by merchants.

I like discussing this here, for what it's worth. Thanks for posting.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:13:38
What do you mean by "aren't entitled to any returns for what you put into it"?  I do think SS could be viewed as a Ponzi because the paid out money is coming from the people putting into it today, not from the growth of the contributions made by the people receiving it. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:34:51
Is it because you're trying to send BTC purchased with cash you sent to Coinbase within the last few days?

"Inherited value is not taxed at the federal level"?  Isn't that what the "inheritance tax" is?
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:40:38
I don't know when it was announced that they would accept it but it was probably viewed at the time as confirmation that BTC could be used as a currency in the exact definition of the term. Things have changed...But, the good news is that, things will change again!  BTC will again be viewed that way in my opinion and companies will start accepting it as payment (again). 
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:39:04
Assuming you mean if BTC were lower than it is today, it probably wouldn't be a certain price that I would sell, it would be if something fundamentally changed with how BTC works. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:28:49
Is it really that big?  Did anyone really spend BTC on their website?  It could be that they had little usage and decided the option wasn't worth the support. Or, it could be the transaction fees right now. Or, it could be the price fluctuation was more than they anticipated. Or, THEY could have an agenda. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:53:12

Let's think about this though. If you were a bank, would you want your customer buying BTC on credit?  Let's play the "what if game" - BTC crashes or goes to zero...who's likely left holding the bag?

Receipts, pictures, the threat of going to jail for filing a police report. None of the traditional things like that could be used for a Bitcoin "theft". 
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:23:06
I hate when I do that
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:29:00
I'd rather just buy BTC and short GBTC. Since futures have an expiration, I personally wouldn't bet on the premium disappearing within a certain time. But, I think we agree, one day the premium in the GBTC won't be there. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:25:27
Never heard of being able to do that. How would you?  The thief could easily move the coins around before trying to redeposit them.

Doesn't mean it'll end with the same results for OP

Not all ETFs. ETNs and leveraged ETFs are the ones at risk of "decay". 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:23:15
Very easy to sell the BTC - and then the cash sits on the exchange until you're able to get it all out. You're overthinking this. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:52:24
How would you have said it?  Just curious. I initially read it as it was meant. A total of 21k over 57 people. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:36:39
I don't know which work and don't work but if you're in the market for a card, try the Citi Double Cash. I love mine.

He's asking about investing options that use leverage, not just buying BTC
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:00:47
I'm not quite sure what you're upset about. A "stop loss" is just that, to stop losing more. If it had gone down from $10k to $5k, you would have been SOOOO happy. The unfortunate part is that you didn't buy back at $9,200. But I wouldn't be upset, it did what you intended. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:04:34
Is it true though to say the fees are increasing "because the price of Bitcoin is increasing". Isn't it more accurate to say "because their are more transactions"?
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:57:55
Some banks you probably do. Some of the larger ones (or tech-focused ones), you may be able to do it through their website. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:30:10
Correct, there would be a fee. It wouldn't always be in the $20 range though. May be a good bit higher, may be a good bit lower. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:07:06
I use Gemini but have only used the $500 daily "bank transfer". I see the wire transfer as an option and, if I ever do use it, I would expect my cash to show up that day (or the next at the latest) and be able to trade with the full amount. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:54:16
It's definitely not MORE concerning but I agree that there should be more diversification among addresses. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:49:46

Agreed, be very careful with these if they become available. They are NOT meant for long term hodling. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:34:53
He is accurate. The premium may stay for awhile and you may make a good profit. But the GBTC shouldn't be used as long term investment in my opinion. One day (and it could be VERY soon), when actual ETFs come out, the GBTC will tank even if BTC price is rising. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:22:20
You're an idiot. The banks don't owe you shit!

"Lots" is a relative term. I don't mean "thousands" but I think it's possible enough people made comments when closing checking and credit card accounts that they took notice.

More demand for the Tether token as people exit other coins. They are looking for "stability".

A quarter on a $100 purchase - that's too much?
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:48:31
I second the use of Gemini
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:56:10
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:47:26
I agree, if Gemini is available there, try them. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:56:23
No, there's a difference between the fee exchanges charge to purchase BTC and the "transfer" fee exchanges/wallets charge to move BTC around. Typically, exchanges charge a percentage for purchase - for example, Gemini charges .25% so, the more you buy, the higher the fee. For transfers, the fee isn't determined by the amount you are moving. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:29:36
Bitcoin's percentage of market cap is a terrible metric when literally anyone can create a coin, arbitrarily determine how much will be pre-mined, and sell it to a few friends. Yes, other big-name coins are increasing in price faster than Bitcoin right now but don't underestimate the other, smaller BS coins and the combined "market cap" they have (temporarily). 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:20:34

You think those raggity ass fools with Occupy had bank accounts?
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:28:42
Well, probably like the casino, you may only be able to claim losses against any gains. Even if it is treated like "stock", you would only be able to claim $3k a year. And, good luck explaining it to an IRS agent - and getting them to believe it. I mean, how could you PROVE they were stolen and not just moved to another address you own?
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:12:45
If BTC is already an equal amount as your 401k and house, why the need to do more?  My advice is to not do it. I'm not saying BTC won't go higher and at a faster rate than the stock market or home equity, but is the reward worth the risk?
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:26:05
"The past fee months"?  Was that a Freudian slip?  lol
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:41:52

This is not a centralized exchange like stocks. Each exchange has its own buyers and sellers. If an investor thinks they can profit from the price diffences than they can fhrough arbitrage.

Your Bitcoin is still Bitcoin when it gets to the wallet. So yes, as BTC price moves, so to does the value you have in the wallet.

Does the Captain in the picture mean Bitcoin the best BOOTY of all time?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:27:37
Ahh, ok - gotcha
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:58:37
I think he was saying the opposite of that. What the value was when you were paid is now considered your cost basis and the growth is taxable upon you selling. I'm not saying he's right, but that's what I think he's saying. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:59:44
Doesn't that include exchange wallets too?  As in a Coinbase wallet...and a Gemini wallet, etc. That would skew the numbers - a lot!

What if it's classified as a currency?  If I exchange USD for Euro and then spend the Euro on an item sometime in the future (or even if I convert it back to USD), do I pay capital gains on any "gain" of the Euro currency during the time I held it?  Does that make sense??  lol

@_date: 2017-12-24 04:12:15
My advice is to not look at the actual "price" you set your buys or sells at but rather the percentage change from a recent high or low. Some price points make since l if you feel like, phycologically, it will be a ceiling or a floor on the short term movement of the BTC price.

You won't be unhappy with Bread 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:55:31
"Obligated" is the key word. Unlike a stock sale or interest on a bank account, exchanges are not YET sending 1099 tax forms in the U.S.  So, although many would claim it's your civic duty to pay taxes or investment gains, without anyone notifying the IRS of the sale, you are under the honor system to do so. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:59:15
I want to know this too. I've never logged into my BTC stuff through anything other than my iPhone. I trust their security more. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:20:48
This was not a requirement when I first started trading with Gemini in March. I have only deposited through ACH...interesting though if they have gone to this requirement.

Coinbase knows what they're doing. This was coordinated with Bcash to publicize their shit.

Gemini is already their competitor - and a much better exchange!
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:26:08
Sometimes it's not about making as much as you can as it's about risk management. I do think most people shouldn't trade, especially relatively small-balance accounts, but it can be the right thing to do for some people. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:05:56
Neither cash nor check. I'm almost positive it's an ACH transaction. Definitely not cash though - not subject to the $10k+ CTR requirement.

Butt?  Each cheek?

I agree with that. It's not for everyone. My strategy is simple...hodl one full coin forever, in a wallet, and trade with enough funds equivalent to another full coin. Sometimes I only own 1, other times I own 2. Incrementally buying on the way down, vice versa on the way up. I'm not comfortable enough permanently holding two full coins all the time (at the present time) but I know the risk.

No chance 1% can explain how it works, in my opinion. STILL so early. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:53:04
I would believe you would NOT owe taxes simply because you're buying and transferring to your wallet. One clarification though - the dollar amount I mentioned, again, is only for cash transactions. If you sent (wire transfer) more than $9,999 it would not necessarily be a transaction that the bank has to report. So, don't worry about the dollar amount unless you are bringing cash from under your mattress that you got from dealing drugs.   lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:39:32
Not scary at all. THIS is the reason not to be fully invested unless BTC is at a point you think it CAN'T go any lower.

Since 2012, the monetary portion of the Prize in Economics has totaled 8 million Swedish kronor. This is equivalent to the amount given for the original Nobel Prizes.[12][13][14] Since 2006, Sveriges Riksbank has given the Nobel Foundation an annual grant of 6.5 million Swedish kronor (in January 2008, approx. US$1 million; 0.7 million Euro) for its administrative expenses associated with the prize as well as 1 million Swedish kronor (until the end of 2008) to include information about the prize in the Nobel Foundation's internet webpage.[15]
Relation to the Nobel Prizes	Edit
The Prize in Economics is not one of the original Nobel Prizes created by Alfred Nobel's will.[3][16][17] However, the nomination process, selection criteria, and awards presentation of the Prize in Economic Sciences are performed in a manner similar to that of the Nobel Prizes.[8][13][18]

US based exchanges (namely Coinbase and Gemini) don't really support a lot of coins. If you want more than BTC, ETH, and LTC, you're going to have to also use other exchanges/wallets like HitBTC or the Jaxx iOS wallet.

Not true, cash may be FDIC insured should Coinbase go under BUT that's very different than "insuring" your BTC or cash if you, or they, get hacked.

It all depends on how much money a person has. If I was a millionaire, I'd have no problem putting the $100k in BTC. If I only had $100k-$300k, I'd probably go with Wal-Mart. I'm super confident about BTC but 10 years is a long time without access to make changes to my decision. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:40:44

I think iOS wallets are safe. I think the riskiest aspect is the potential for user-error. I use Bread wallet for BTC. And it is very easy to transfer from the exchanges to the wallet and back again. 
I recently purchased a Nano S hardware wallet but haven't set it up yet. People on here had said an actual USB device is hackable.  I don't think it would be worth it for someone to purchase a hardware wallet if they have less than $500 of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:29:05
Ok, I stand corrected about if THEY are hacked but, still, if you get hacked don't expect coverage. And, if CB were to get hacked, I'm pretty sure FDIC isn't covering that. I wonder what insurance company is willing to take that policy on...

It may be wrong advice but how are you absolutely certain you are right (to the extent you are saying he is wrong)?  I mean, has the IRS officially said crypto should be treated like stock?  Like collectibles?  Like commodities?  Or anything else we could compare it to...
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:27:10
But you're assuming the IRS considers BTC and ETH or any other exchange within crypto to be "like-kind". That's a big assumption. Look, I'm not saying I'm right, just playing devil's advocate. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:46:47
With ETFs undoubtedly on the way, paying a premium with this investment doesn't seem wise. Even if BTC increases in value, the GBTC could see a decline in price. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:00:50
Same here
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:57:21
Honestly, it depends on how important $400 is to you AND if you can continue to invest more after the $400 if it goes down during the next 1-6 months. If $400 isn't a lot of money to you, roll the dice and do it all now. If it goes down 20-50%, invest another $200-$400 if you still feel confident in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:54:28
I strongly believe in BTC and that the returns will be better than traditional investments over the next few years or decade but it's not fair to say that retirement accounts got "wiped out" in 2008. Bitcoin has seen bigger percentage drops in its short life and stocks are now at all-time highs. Diversification is very important with investing. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:05:55
Nope. At times I've seen $300-$800 differences even between Gemini and Conbase. Even more between other exchanges.

Could be that they already regret getting out and want to buy back in at as cheap a price as they can get
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:10:12
I never buy-all or sell-all. It's incremental trades (buys as the price drops, sells as it rises) and I really don't like getting to the point when I'm all in or all out. However, I'm all in right now and adding the $500 daily limit Gemini allows as soon as I get the email saying my daily limit has been reset!
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:39:41
We are not arguing the same points. I am saying that an advisor might actually advise a client to put their money into a S&amp;P ETF. To blanketly say that a person won't make as much with an advisor is NOT fact.

GE is the perfect example!  Earning, profits, dividend...all in DECLINE!  When a company (or Bitcoin) reach its true value, weakness ensues.

@_date: 2018-09-07 14:04:54
I’m not sure you understand that you don’t need to transact in whole bitcoins. How would price change the fact that bitcoin can do what it does?  And offer the benefits it does?
And I still disagree about “dominance”, whatever you and I think it means. I mean it to be the percent of overall dollars in crypto (“market cap”). How could a bitcoin believer NOT be happy about bitcoin’s increasing weighting in the overall industry?  Do you think it would be a terrible thing if bitcoin got back to 100% and all other coins went to zero?  Especially if all crypto money was then invested in BTC?  Btw, I don’t think that will happen, just exaggerating for effect.

No, it’s not clear. I understand clearly that when BTC is worth more, you can buy more things, duh. But, that’s not what we’re talking about. You are acting as if BTC, as a mechanism, can do more when it’s worth more. 
And your “analysis” doesn’t mean shit to me or anyone else. Just because you think it, doesn’t mean it’s true. You aren’t using real argumentative data, just words. I’m not saying BTC, if all alone, would go back to “less than a million”. I’m saying, what if BTC, all alone, had a market cap of ONE TRILLION.

You're right, I did!  Thank you for reminding me
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:41:03
A quick example would be to have set a "buy" at $19k (5% drop), $18k (10% drop), $16k (20% drop) and $14k (30% drop) from the recent $20k all-time high. Although BTC can (and has!) drop more than 30% from that $20k price, you hopefully get the idea. And then, as we hopefully push back toward $20k, I'll be scaling back at certain percentage change gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:39:50
Just read an article today on CNBC that said the opposite. That the IRS considers BTC "property" and, like stock, it's considered a taxable event when selling, even if it's a swap from one crypto to another. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:03:08
The GBTC is a Trust so "premium" can be, and is, built into the "share price" right now. You are basically paying 50%+ to the actual amount of BTC the Trust holds. When an ETF is available, the ETF share price should very closely track the price movement of the underlying asset (BTC).

Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple do have "value" if you understand that you are the .00000000001% owner in their balance sheet but what happens when their stock prices are trading at 20x+ what they earn?  Is the value still there then?  And don't say "yes" because they are still growing companies. At some point, growth will peak. Your perception of the Bitcoin "bubble" can't be compared to anything else. Bitcoin is trying to find its true value and it may not stabilize until it finds a price you and I will be shocked at!
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:24:57
That's absolutely not correct my friend. You are making general statements about what you think happened to people "60 years of age". Most were not aggressively invested (or shouldn't have been) and were not largely part of that $2 Trillion in losses. My point, though, is that "wiped out" inferes "lost", "gone", "down to zero". No matter a person's age, exposure to stock, etc., if they didn't overreact, they have more money today by far than they did before they drop started in '07.

If you have no other means of investing in Bitcoin and you look at this as an additional way to diversify your investment dollars then, yes, I would do it. The interest you pay on your 401k loan goes to yourself and as long as BTC doesnt go to zero, I think it's worth the gamble. If it does go to zero, increase your contributions to make up for the loss.  My guess is that by the time your payoff the loan, your BTC profits will be greater than the interest you paid anyway.

Well, although the media would make you think the banks are REQUIRED to report "large deposits", that is NOT the case. ONLY cash deposits exceeding $9,999 are required in the form of a CTR. It most definitely is not the case on electronic transactions. Sooo, I think it would be a near-miracle for the IRS to get their shit together for relatively small transactions too quickly.

Here’s some math - for a ROTH IRA, say you contribute $5,000 and it grows to $20,000. You avoid paying taxes on $15,000 - so you save approximately $3,000. Get it so far or is that too hard?
For a Traditional IRA, say you contribute $5,000 pre-tax and avoid paying 30% taxes. And you take it out 10 years later at 15% taxes - saving $750. Got it?

There is, BUT, the GBTC is not “pegged” to the price of BTC. When, and IF, an ETF is ever approved, GBTC should lose the “premium” that’s built into the price. Sooo, you could see a world where BTC jumps in price if the ETF is approved and GBTC sees substantial losses.

I personally would give a local business a lot of my business for just 3% off if paying with Bitcoin. As a business owner, you would save the 3% credit card processing fee so not much of a loss on your end. You may have to offer a little more of a discount though to cover the transfer fee the customer would incur.

It's because Gemini (or any other exchange) doesn't actually know if you have the funds. It may have come out of your account BUT if it's reported to Gemini as NSF, they better still have your BTC to sell and get their money back.

As unknown as the rest of the world still. No comments by the company at all to "stay away from" or "don't speak of". Most colleagues are interested in learning more when I casually bring it up.

@_date: 2017-11-19 04:04:07
At this point, it's really not about how many "Bitcoins" you can buy. Think of it as any other investment - if you invest $500 and BTC goes from $8k a coin to $16k a coin, then you've doubled your money.

What do you mean by "can't use my BTC till a week"?  If you are referring to the inability to move the purchased BTC to a wallet, well of course that's going to happen. Why would Gemini give you access to THEIR money until they feel certain the funds would come back as NSF from your bank.

@_date: 2017-11-17 13:03:45
Respectfully, I don't think I misunderstood. We understand the risks and (most of us) can tolerate the volatility. We believe BTC is still in the infancy of something big - an asset/investment that is still trying to find its true value, similar to gold back then. Obviously, after a century or two, gold has found its value, thus, most of the time, a pretty stable, non-volatile, asset. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:37:20

My response would be, "based on what"?  An asset, unlike we've ever seen before, is trying to find its true worth. How can anyone, on this Sub or anywhere else, truly know what price it will finally reach when it becomes "stable" as compared to traditional investments/assets. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:04:13
I feel you're not already confirmed through an exchange, you likely won't be buying any coins today unless you use localbitcoins.com. 
My advice is to use Gemini for an exchange though (USA). Easy, low fees, and at least some semblance of a customer service department.

@_date: 2018-02-01 12:39:20
Gemini too, I got one from them yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:42:28
true BIG if
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:08:48
Mine shows 272 transactions and a large "gross" from sales. But, I only transferred around $13k from my bank during the calendar year. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:41:11
I’m confused...if you sell, where does the price go?
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:48:03
Are you sure you’re actually in a 401k and not another type like a SIMPLE IRA?  And are you older than 59 1/2?  If it’s a 401k and you’re younger than 59 1/2, he’s right, your plan is VERY rare. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:35:56
So, in your expert opinion, at what price CAN speculative interest keep the price at?
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:44:33
I did a small amount of BTC to ETH and vise versa. Not sure if those are included in the number on the 1099. I will disagree a bit though about your comment that "any trade from crypto to fiat is taxable". I mean, it COULD be taxable if there was a gain. And it probably is true that even LOSING trades are included in the number on the 1099, we just have to declare what our "cost basis" was on our tax return. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:48:23
Huh?  So no 1099 email today?
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:27:37
C'mon man, you're not serious right?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:16:13
Yes, now we're in agreement. In your first sentence, you say "taxable event". I'm just being picky, didn't want other people to think the word "taxable" by itself implied that the "gross proceeds" number on the 1099 was the amount they would owe taxes on. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:26:05
Why?  What do they have in common?
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:49:19
Also said by someone about $10,000 when it was at $50
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:39:50
Yes. 272 transactions and WELL over $20k in "gross proceeds". 
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:21:47
See the "sell" button?
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:51:34
Good sign people!  The bottom is very close now.   lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:38:56
Not true, Gemini too
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:23:26
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:56:50
It's legit for sure. The 1099 has my full name, address, and month-by-month gross proceeds of trades shown on it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:44:34
Yes, I think that's what it is - the gross "sales" of all transactions to fiat. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:09:26
$500 at 8,501
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:02:24
Right - not the NUMBER of buyers vs sellers, it's the amount of money one side has put up for trades vs the other. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:48:19
Exactly, "cost basis" has to be reported by the person as well. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:44:49
In 2-5 years the Kardashians won’t be cool anymore
@_date: 2018-07-19 04:35:58
Love it
@_date: 2018-07-16 03:21:57
Buy more now
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:40:32
Yes, I got one from Gemini - looked exactly the same. It's legit. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:39:34
@_date: 2018-07-24 01:04:52
Or, it could go down 50% in the coming 12 months.  But, you have a good point. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:34:29
I'm claiming gains on the return I'm going to submit later today but ONLY providing the gross proceeds of sales that the 1099 from Gemini shows and then my calculated "cost basis" to offset most of that large number. I'm not showing trades, addresses, dates, etc. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:56:03
As a financial advisor myself, they cannot very often
@_date: 2018-04-29 06:06:15
Bitcoin is no more “valued in fiat” than the US Dollar is valued in Yen. It’s just the exchange rate. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:45:33
I have Chase and have had no problems for over a year now, buying $500 at a time through Gemini...probably a total of 35 times over 13 months. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:10:27
Your “to” is too short
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:24:20
How is it any different?  1% is 1%
