The Arstechnica article doesn't even mention bitcoin, let alone bitcoin theft.

I'm not finding any good sources either. Nothing on the LastPass blog. No official statement from them that I can dig up, just vague references. 1Password does says a little more about it on their blog.  
Here a [LastPass forum admin briefly describes]( how direct fill works with their app in 5.0.
Here's a [twitter conversation]( from  stating only that the issue has been "addressed" in Android 5.0. 
[From 1Password:]( "we used the latest security and accessibility features in Android 5 (Lollipop) to allow 1Password to fill into other apps without making use of the clipboard."
Per [this discussion,]( it doesn't seem to be implemented in Keepass2Android yet.

Does 2FA via email or yubikey help against this vulnerability?

I think the reason for a new change wallet is that once you have spent from the previous wallet that public key can be observed by others and I think that makes your bitcoins at that address very slightly less secure.

TLDR - Lastpass (and another) password manager uses Androids clipboard to fill data to other apps. Problem being information in the clipboard can be accessed by any other app. This issue is fixed by upgrading to Android 5.0 Lollipop. 
But why would Lastpass even operate this way? 1Password waited to offer the auto-fill feature until the release of Lollipop because the developers were aware of the vulnerability.

I still have the original thread open in another tab. Any way I can share that? Any need?
edit: The original thread still loads, just can't be commented on.  Here it is again:

Circle and Coinbase are not only online wallets, but exchanges where bitcoins can be bought with credit or fiat.

Coinbase requires linking a bank account as far as I can tell.

check out Yubikey for excellent 2FA
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:29:53
WTF. Who closed the original thread? What does it mean about r/bitcoin?
edit: Thanks for the answers.
@_date: 2014-12-17 08:12:47
Yeah no bank account needed but still a lot of private information including the last 4 digits of your SSN.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:51:08
Could you explain this at more length?
@_date: 2014-12-18 10:09:29
Not sure how to give credit to you OP. I kinda reposted this [here]( in as a text post with some brief explanation. Trying to get the word to interested parties.

Hopefully the senator's actions add value to bitcoins  :)

Jimmy said something like, "If you can't keep your bitcoins on a Slovenian exchange, where can you?"

So sad and so relatable. Wish you the best.
