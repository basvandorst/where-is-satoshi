Right, so what advantages does converting your money into bitcoin have, from a banking perspective?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:24:33
It’s actually very simple.  Generating electricity consumes resources and produces a carbon footprint.  Bitcoin mining consumes over 1% of the worlds energy while providing zero utility.  
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:43:11
“They don’t need to have an audit,” fucking lol.  The whole premise is that they have billions in liquid USD, the easiest fucking audit ever, but they will never do it and this shit will just blow up in front of your eyes.

@_date: 2018-01-31 02:40:09
Your question is does it make any sense for bitfinex to be in on the wholesale ripoff of several hundred million dollars in real money?  Answer: yes.  
The thing that makes zero sense is why Tether would be resistant to an actual audit when it would just be a matter of showing a balance sheet and proof of funds that matches the amount of tether issued.  
The other thing that makes zero sense is them claiming that wires were suspended and that the amount of tether wasn’t going to significantly increase in April 2017... since then, the amount of Tether has increased by 250%.  So supposedly they have over $2 billion USD, ACTUAL CASH, sitting in a bank account in Poland?  Completely unaudited?  
Arguing with you people is ridiculous... just like every other exchange meltdown or exit scam.  “Do you realize how ridiculous you sound saying that Mt Gox / Bitconnect / Coincheck is a scam / insolvent?  These ‘businesses’ are very profitable!”

Hundreds of millions in what, exactly... crypto?  Unless they can liquidate all that into real currency (and they can’t) they don’t have it.  You take EVERYTHING these people say at face value.  If they really have it, why no audit?  If they really are making hundreds of millions per month they would be one of the biggest businesses in the world... instead they are some unaudited podunk that no one knows a fucking thing about.  They have a website and maybe a couple of guys on reddit who occasionally reply to things.  
No one questions shit, it’s all just written off as FUD.  
Lol and from that link you sent:


Yet the supply of tether has increased by 250% since then.  Any questions as to why?  Do you even know what bank they have their funds in?  Has that restriction on wires been lifted?
Mt Gox another classic case, disappearance of over $6 BILLION in BTC by today’s prices... and do we even know if they were hacked?  By who?  Will the funds ever be recovered?  Why are you sure it won’t happen again to pretty much every exchange?
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:25:40
Or they could have lost 100% of their money on Mt Gox, when 650k coins were stolen forever (plus another 200k coins lost and recovered, but still in limbo with the trustee!).  Or they could have lost their coins in a number of other huge exchange exit scams and losses.
Or they simply could be unable to get their money off of the exchange once they sell.  This happens ALL THE TIME.
Or they could have had their keys stolen through some other means.
Or they could have simply lost their keys at some point. 
Or they could have died and no one has the keys and the coins are lost forever.
Lol fucking Satoshi himself had seemingly not made a PENNY off of bitcoin - he holds a MILLION coins and none of them have been sold.  He could be dead, he could have lost his coins.  So basically, someone who has never traded a bitcoin has made more money than Satoshi.  Satoshi had to pay to mine and never realized a penny!  
OR Satoshi DOES hold the coins and is waiting for the perfect moment to drop a nuclear bomb sized sell order on the market.
Which possibility is worse?

Lol this sub is in denial of the most fundamental economic facts.
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:12:31
But there is, and there does.  A coffee shop isn’t holding bitcoin on their books.  They pay the middleman to accept the bitcoin and give them the spot price in fiat.  This cafe isn’t receiving crypto, they are receiving Yen.
It’s actually the bitcoin which is completely irrelevant here.  The consumer didn’t buy the bitcoin with the intent to use it in transactions, he bought it for the purpose of speculation.  By “spending it” he is effectively shorting the currency and saying “I think this will be worth less tomorrow so I will spend it instead of fiat.”

Bitcoin has lost insane amounts to fraud and theft.  When Mt Gox got hacked, 850,000 bitcoins were stolen.  That was over 6% of all bitcoins in existence at that time, and an even bigger portion of all liquid bitcoins.  
Actually bitcoin is a constant source of fraud and money laundering, part of the reason banks had to put a blanket ban on credit and debit purchases of crypto is because people were buying crypto with stolen identities.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:17:31
That’s why it makes 100,000 more sense to hold USD or some foreign currency.  It makes no fucking sense to hold crypto.  Holders can sell off and you will lose 15% or the value of your holdings in a day... or lose 70% of the value in two weeks... holding crypto as money you need to survive is INSANE.

@_date: 2018-03-30 21:37:23
Yep, no one.  Coin pumping stories from coin journalists don’t mean much.  I guarantee that there is 1000x as much ACTUAL transaction activity in USD in Venezuela.
Btw that story is from the time of ATH, before Bitcoin cratered by 70%+.  Wonder how they’re feeling about that “stable currency” now, lol.  Any employee paid in bitcoin got ripped off by 70% at that time unless they cashed out into USD.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:36:41
So what if I live in a modern civilized society where the economy hasn’t completely collapsed?  
Also, who is going to accept my bitcoins if the economy has completely collapsed?  Wouldn’t people rather trade with things that have intrinsic and stable value at that point, rather than a wildly fluctuating token traded purely for speculative purposes?
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:38:45
But isn’t bitcoin always priced and valued against fiat currency anyway?  And doesn’t it have more extreme fluctuations on a daily basis than any currency on earth?  Didn’t it just drop by 15% or something yesterday, and hasn’t it experienced even bigger drops and spikes in the past?  How can that conceivably be useful as a currency?
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:48:41

@_date: 2018-03-22 21:15:04
Bitcointalk, a forum for bitcoiners, pointed out this fact years ago, literally back in 2013.  Look back at the archives
Are you implying that the researchers are lying?  Just inventing this out of whole cloth?  And that bitcoiners from back then, who have a vested financial stake in pumping the price, invented a lie about there being CP embedded in the blockchain?
No one here is going to tell you exactly where it is (hopefully) because that could be a felony.  I’m sure if you want to go digging for the exact location, you could find it and see it for yourself.  
Seriously the delusion and head in the sand behavior on here is staggering.  Absolutely staggering.  You KNOW it’s true but you don’t want to admit it.
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:29:37
Lol no one here is grappling with the claims, because the claims are true and undeniable fact.  Now you’re acting like it’s just some appeal to authority with no fact?
Fact: someone intentionally embedded CP in bitcoin
It doesn’t matter that a billion monkeys typing at a billion typewriters would eventually write hamlet or that an infinitely long number would eventually contain CP.  
The fact is that someone INTENTIONALLY EMBEDDED CP INTO BITCOIN AND SUCCEEDED.

Without benefit of hindsight, for all the trustee knew, he was getting the best prices he could get.  It’s like how this sub was spamming “buy the dip buy the dip buy the dip” at 13... at 12... 11, 10, 9, 8, etc.  People buying “the dip” were getting cooked unless they actually bought at the bottom.  
There could be some big holders who are slowly trickling out over time through multiple wallets, but when big sells start coming, even if it is spread out over a longer period of time, it could trigger other big sells and snowball into apocalypse.  
Smart sellers sometimes need to just completely dump stock without waiting, it happens all the time. If you’re a smart seller at the cusp of the financial crisis, you hit the “dump everything” button, you don’t sit on your ass watching it meltdown.
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:04:39

Market is definitely paper thin.  Just don’t know if I think he made any mistakes without the benefit of hindsight.  What if he just sells 2000 coins in a day and comes back the next day to a much lower market?  There really are no guarantees with the price.  And he still has an absolute shitload of coins on hand, and there’s a very good chance he will dump them as well.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:55:23
The reason is that any significant sell pressure absolutely tanks the market... why do you think people spam HODL memes constantly?  It’s because they know if there is any sell pressure, prices collapse.  ONE whale converting something like 20k coins to fiat crashes the price by 65%+, what does that tell you?

@_date: 2018-03-22 23:24:13

@_date: 2018-03-23 06:23:12
Yes, we get it, pi is an infinitely long number. 
1) people actually DID find the CP in the blockchain.  They didn’t just theoretically find it, they ACTUALLY found it.  You could search 100 years and you will not find CP in pi.  You could search for a couple of minutes with this guys info and find the CP he embedded in the blockchain.
2) someone actually did put it in there, intentionally
3) the person who intentionally inserted it could announce the location of it and effectively transmit CP.  Good luck finding CP in Pi and then telling people exactly where to find it.
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:18:40

Ok, say I’m buying a house.  I need $600k.  You offer to lend me that amount in bitcoin based on the average price for the month in which the loan begins.  I want a 30 year mortgage, meaning I will pay you back principal plus interest over that 30 year period.   We agree that I will pay you back in bitcoin, the same amount I borrowed + interest (also in bitcoin).
What interest rate do you propose to charge me for borrowing $600k worth of bitcoin for 30 years?  Remember to price in the risk that I may not pay you back, that I may go bankrupt and discharge the loan in bankruptcy.  You will be able to foreclose on the house as collateral for the loan, but it will be very costly and you’ll eat a big loss if you have to do that.

Ah yes, the good ol Luddite accusations from bitcoiners.  Your analogy really doesn’t even fit here.  Cars replaced horses because they were a superior means of transportation.  Bitcoin isn’t superior means of payment processing or transferring funds.  In any case, I’m not comparing one currency to another, I’m comparing equities in companies to a digital token.
Also for that matter, bitcoin consumes a fuckton of electricity while not even handling 0.00000001% of financial transactions whereas our current payment and currency systems are significantly more efficient... so if anything bitcoin is the shitting horse in this situation.

@_date: 2018-03-30 21:16:26
My point is that 99.99999% of all transaction activity with bitcoin has been solely for the purpose of speculation.  No one spends a deflationary currency for one thing, and they definitely don’t spend something this absurdly inconvenient.  It’s the reason why this sub and others spam HODL at each other all the time, it’s because no one intends to spend it, they just want the price to go up so they can imagine being rich.

That just does not matter.  People are not suited to “be their own bank” and these are flaws of the bitcoin system.

No fraud protection, no way to reverse fraudulent transactions, no way to recover your key if it has been lost, it’s fucking insane.  
If I told someone “ok don’t lose your password to your online bank account or the bank keeps all the money” or “if I take your password to your online bank account I keep all the money and there’s nothing you can do” they would think I was absolutely fucking insane.

In any case what I do for a living isn’t really relevant.  What is relevant is:
1) no one uses bitcoin as currency 
2) bitcoin is absurdly volatile and will always be absurdly volatile
3) anyone advising that bitcoin isn’t absurdly risky is a fraud

Who is going to accept that?  The amount of retailers who accept crypto directly (ie, not through a third party like bitpay) is trivial.  And what happens when you’ve spent your bitcoin?  You’re going to go back to an exchange and get more?
Also why do you get to handwave all exchanges closing?  It happens frequently.  My Gox closed and lost 850,000 bitcoins in the process.  And if you’re handwaving the third party problems of bitcoin then why even worry about “third party problems” at all?
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:03:04
By what metric is it increasingly used as a currency?  I see more businesses saying they won’t accept it anymore.  And the ones that did “accept it” actually just accepted it through middlemen like bitpay nearly every time, which basically means they didn’t accept it.

Edit: oh wait MS dumped it in January and has brought it back (for now).  Guarantee they will dump it again in the future.  Fees are only low now because (big surprise) no one is using it.

If so-called “silent money” is just forming over cash for equity of a real business with zero mechanisms to protect them on corporate governance outside of Delaware law they better hope they got a really fucking good price and that their returns are going to greatly beat the market because their transactional costs and risks are much higher than just stuffing money into their vanguard account.
“In your experience”?  Pray tell, what experience do you have in venture capital or running a start-up?  And no, I’m not talking about some ICO you’re doing or opening a weed dispensary, I’m talking about guiding an actual business from seed funding to series funding to a potential IPO.

They all do it with middlemen converting them into fiat and receive it as USD or Euros, etc.  A large additional fee is charged to the consumer per transaction.  Btw I don’t think steam does it anymore.  They dumped it because the fees were too high.  
In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.
LOL $20 a transaction.  Who needs credit cards!

You can buy all the the registered securities you want, you can invest in funds, you can invest in commodities, you can invest in property... the list of things you can’t invest in is relatively small and is mostly just cases where they don’t want your piddling sums of money anyway, they are selling to major institutional investors for reasons that have little to do with legal restrictions and more to do with you lacking the experience and sophistication needed to actually engage.  If a company is issuing $80 million in convertible notes in a 144A offering they’re not going to sell $25k of them to fucking joe six pack when they have a few institutional investors lined up to buy $25+ million each, you aren’t worth the fucking time.  And guess what, it would be stupid for you to buy them because you don’t even know what they fucking are!

That is absolutely and undeniably false and you can’t say that.  Crypto swings by 10% or more on a daily basis and has lost more than 65% of its value within about a week as recently as last month!  It could absolutely go down by another 50% or much more.  The only thing preventing it from going down is enough people holding and refusing to sell.
Any kind of significant sell pressure can massively tank the price.  The Gox trustee tanked the price by 60%+ by selling off a mere 30k or so coins, and he still has 165k or so coins on hand.  There are other huge whales and the majority of the supply is controlled by less than 500 or so whale wallets.  If they decide to sell the market will get nuked and you will lose all of your purchasing power.
Your employees accepting crypto sounds ridiculous.  One week you could be overpaying them by 20%, the next week they could be underpaid by 20%.  They aren’t able to spend what you’re giving them on anything until they pay additional conversion fees on an exchange to turn it into a usable form of currency.

Or take the opposite example - if the price of bitcoin crashes then suddenly the borrower got a free house since they’re paying back the loan with dirt cheap coins. 
And this is just the simplest fucking example.  THERE IS NO CREDIT IN BITCOINVILLE.  No one would have a fucking clue how to set interest rates because it’s an unpredictable speculative token.

No, stocks represent OWNERSHIP of the company.  The COMPANY produces value.  Of course the stock certificate doesn’t produce anything, it’s a piece of paper.  Stocks themselves were devised as a means to raise capital for business ventures, which they do very well.
If you own a bitcoin you just own a bitcoin.  You’re not a part owner of anything.  There is no “bitcoin incorporated” that makes widgets.

If you look back at the housing bubble it was insane at the consumer level, credit was so widely available and just given out like candy with ZERO accountability whatsoever and people loved the freedom of a world where everyone could be a homeowner and property values just spiraled upwards into infinity... right up until the point where everyone defaulted because the banks shouldn’t have been giving mortgages to everyone and then the whole house of cards came crashing to the ground.  Obviously the banks and the lenders and the rating agencies were all to blame but if we treat everyone as equally sophisticated then so were the consumers.  There were countless consumers who falsified income information or provided no info or took on multiple mortgages knowing that if property values fell they would default on everything.
Then people demanded more regulation and enforcement against some of these abuses and bad incentives (and of course some of the regulations that WERE in place may have contributed to the problem) and blamed ONLY the banks and mortgage brokers.  If we just scrapped securities regulations and average joes start getting ripped off or if there’s a bear market and they get cleaned out, who gets blamed?  The average joe for not being savvy and sophisticated and taking stupid risks?  NO - people will blame the bankers and the brokers and the companies, even if they act reasonably.

But the fees for bitcoin are so much higher from everyone’s point of view.  Fees to retailers overall are tiny, like sub 1%.  And that’s just with credit/debit... and some of those fees are passed back to consumers with rewards.  And it’s a system that gives everyone access to credit at a whim.  
For Bitcoin, the fees only go low when no one uses the system for transactions - like now.  
It is not viable as a currency, ever, even on just a technical level. 
Again, bitcoin is not about people wanting to improve transaction systems.  It is about people wanting to speculate on increases in value and sell for more fiat than they put in the system.
Again, ONE bitcoin transaction uses like 1.5x as much electricity as 100,000 visa transactions.  Miners get paid for that.  This isn’t even counting the massive inefficiencies and costs when people convert their money to and from coin on exchanges.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:37:10
Lol you think people will actually use this as a currency.  Hate to break it to you but people only buy it because they think someone else will give them fiat for it.

But you ARE trying to justify people permanently converting their wealth into crypto.  Otherwise, you absolutely must factor in the cost of converting crypto into fiat and fiat into crypto into every transaction that is ever done, because otherwise everyone using crypto just have their money in a practically unspendable form for the vast majority of the time.
Once you factor in the costs of converting to and from fiat the inefficiency becomes even more insane, not to mention the fact that you constantly have to go through centralized conversion sources like exchanges means you lose the decentralization that people here claim is so important. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:07:45
Easy, if someone wants to pay with bitcoin you just have them use a middleman to convert the BTC to dollars and then they receive the dollars.  The person paying with BTC pays whatever the applicable conversion fee.  Long story short, they aren’t actually accepting bitcoin.

You don’t understand banking, period.  The whole idea of banking is letting people borrow money in exchange for interest or equity.  This doesn’t work with deflationary crypto.  No one will ever lend with bitcoin.  If you don’t understand why there just is no arguing with you, this isn’t a “they’ll adapt!” situation at all.

Sorry man but you are insane.  Saying that pawnshops give loans?  They are loan sharks that charge exorbitant interest for trivial amounts of money.  Pawn shops can’t even loan you money for a new car much less a house.  That’s like saying banks could be replaced by payday loan shops.
Banks set up multi-million and multi-billion dollar credit facilities.  They underwrite major offerings of securities.  They act as advisors for major M&amp;A transactions.
You seriously do not have a clue what you’re talking about and you’re embarrassing everyone here.

Terrific, how about you go do the research since you are convinced that it isn’t true.  You have the resources at the ready and you should be able to pull up the block with a tiny bit of research, I don’t need to show it to you.
I mean if the place where people claim it is is actually clean, you can come back and say “I saw it myself and it’s a lie!” and you can write your own peer reviewed paper calling the researchers liars.
Unless of course, you’re being disingenuous and using semantics to get out of admitting to yourself that the blockchain contains CP.  In that case, you’ll just stick your head in the sand and say see no evil hear no evil it can’t exist.

Whether what he did was a good idea, offered new opportunities or was even legally enforceable is an entirely separate discussion.  We’re talking about lending and finance and what you linked is insanely irrelevant.

1) those “technologies” are empty and going nowhere.  Just marketing tools to try and keep the price alive and squeeze more money out of lay investors.  Again - no one will ever use bitcoin as currency.  99.99% of bitcoin activity is solely for the purpose of speculation - it has always been that way and it will always be that way.
2) it will always remain volatile up until governments around the world end up banning exchanges and mining
3) the volatility isn’t the reason you don’t want bitcoin in your portfolio, it’s the fact that it is inherently empty and worthless.  It’s like including a stack of lottery tickets in your portfolio, but worse, because bitcoin requires timing.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:13:50
“Bitcoin always crashes”

Current system allows for a ton of investing freedom.  You have more investment options now than at any other time in history.  Our current securities regulation regime respects a balance between investor protection and market efficiency/freedom and usually just focuses on disclosure rather than banning instruments.  Not saying it’s perfect but the OP post is a very inaccurate description of the situation.

Yes, that is the difference between ordinary income tax and capital gains tax.  
Crypto is still relatively young in terms of tax law (this may be the first year the IRS starts auditing people and we start seeing some serious legal challenges on this front) so I don’t think things are set in stone.

Sure, good luck trading with all exchanges banned.  There’s a reason they all require KYC/AML, it’s because governments can shut them down in an instant if they aren’t toeing the line.
