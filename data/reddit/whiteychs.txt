I think that depends greatly on the overhead with shipping. You could do the majority of refinement on Earth provided that it's fairly simple to simply launch the material on a trajectory to land on Earth.

Why would you need to process the materials in space?

This is a great idea. Banks are public and have their own security.

Speaking out and expressing a different view is perfectly fine.
Doing it in a way that insults and demonizes someone is not.
You're being counter-productive.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:05:38
Keep being true to your opinions. Arguing for a position honestly and without personal attacks should never be demeaned.

I don't even... what?! That's like saying toast doesn't work. This isn't a matter of works or not.


Nowhere did I ever say that. Jesus Christ. I don't know where it will go, I've said this multiple times. That's why you have a plan for it going either direction (or staying the same).


Because at a certain mark it makes sense to sell. Where that mark is depends on the person.
If I have $50k in credit card debt and my btc assets are now worth $60k I would sell even if *everyone* was speculating that it would rise to $80k.  Why? Because it's too much risk. The risk vs. reward pendulum has swung.
I'm not saying that it will not increase past 1200 (in my case). I'm saying that at 1200 my investment is worth cashing out half *in my particular case*. 
The college student with nothing to his name has a much different risk to reward matrix than does a wealthy retiree.  Finding where you fit in that matrix is key to determining your limits.

Where did I say you would always win or that it was completely safe? Please, show me if you're going to accuse me of things I never said.
What I *said* is that setting realistic limits and sticking to it is going to be a -safer- than trying to "ride the wave" and to attempt selling and buying at the very peak and the very low.
I also believe in diversifying in investments outside of bitcoin... have a problem with that too?

Just the US and only that period? No. Most cultures and all periods. Men have always been at the forefront of technological advancements. Things developed that way due to predispositions.
People nowadays like to stick their fingers in their ears and shout "bigot" whenever someone mentions innate differences between the sexes, but that's self-delusion.
I've worked with smart, motivated women in IT and they're very much an asset. But they're also in the minority when compared to most.
I know that's not PC or the "correct" thing to say around here, but it's simply true from the way I have experienced it.
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:22:09
You're taking that risk if you *ever* sell. That's not a reason to hold on to it forever.
If you're looking at from an investment point of view, the investment needs to actualize. If you bought in at $200 usd and sell at $1000 usd, that's a very good investment.  Even if it reaches $2000, you couldn't have known and made the decision based on your current needs.
Turning $20,000 into $100,000 isn't something the cry about simply because you could have made $200,000. This is especially true if you're in the financial position where waiting really isn't an option and you need to funds.  It's best to cash out early while you have that bird in hand.
If you go into it with that frame of mind then you'll never sell and you'll never benefit from that investment.
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:37:05
That or simply set a limit for yourself and stick to it.
Sell at 1100 and buy a 900. You'll probably lose out on some (say if it rises to 1300 after you sold) - but it's safer than trying to ride the wave and end up missing your opportunity for at least some profit.
I guess it depends on how risk averse the person is, really.
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:24:00
That's a loaded question.
How much do you have invested?
How much are you willing to lose?
How much are you willing to spend when it's in a lull?
Do you want to hold on to some or go all out?
And countless other questions.
I'm, personally, selling half at the 1200 mark and buying at the 600 mark.
I have enough btc where buying more isn't attractive unless it's very low and selling half at 1200 is enough to pay for my hassle and then some. That still leaves me some to just see where it goes.
@_date: 2017-01-07 20:18:36


No, it can't.
The statement only means that you will lose out on opportunities that may occur if you hold waiting for an absolute peak (such as the market skyrocketing to $2000usd/1btc) but you may also avoid crashes as opposed to waiting for a higher peak.
Nobody said anything about 50%.  It could crash immediately tomorrow or hit 2000 usd overnight. 


Dear Lord, no.  If I say, "the market is now at 800. If it hits 1100 I will sell. If it hits 600 I will buy. Otherwise I will hold."  That's not prediction - that's a plan. At no point am I making a prediction about the market.  One of the three *will* happen - it will either go up, down, or stay the same.
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:35:29
The fact that you have to make that point, kind of makes his when you think about it.
He didn't say that women didn't contribute. He said that men contributed vastly more - which is true.
People always come up with Hopper and Lovelace. Yeah, there's two. There probably a few others. How many men were there that contributed just as much or more as those two women in what we would consider IT? Hundreds? Thousands? Tens of thousands? Most don't get recognition because they're men.
Ever heard of William Shockley? John Fleming? Dennis Ritchie? Ken Thompson? Tim Berners-Lee?
Did you have to look any of those guys up? Because they contributed just as much if not *more* in some cases to modern computing. And that's a short list of what could be thousands. Seriously. How many men did IBM employ developing this stuff and making break-through after break-through? How many men did MIT have in their labs? How many men working for the military doing this research? A fucking lot.
It's not even close. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:09:27
I never said anything about probability - only that it's safer than trying to on-the-fly predict the market. No idea where you're getting this "half the time" stuff.

ACH transfer tells you it will take 5-7 days. Did you think it wouldn't crash within a week?
You kind of accepted that risk when you agreed to wait up to 7 days...

Well, maybe *you* can't.

Probably due to the increased spotlight. The more bitcoin is in the media, the more people are curious about it, the more people buy and the higher the speculation.

No, $4000 dollars will get you a mid 2000's civic in decent condition - which is what someone trying to cut costs SHOULD buy.
A $500 car payment will get you a new Audi (assuming you don't have shitty credit) - something someone trying to extend the dollar absolutely should NOT buy.
Example:  (that was on the first page of my first search of a random city)
There are a ton of good cars below $4k.
Even people who are rich own little shitty cars because they're nice A-to-B beaters that you can drive into the ground while preserving the porche or BMW in the garage for sunny weekend drives.


Intelligent people invest money in things that appreciate in value (such as property). If you're going to be spending money on something that's "nice" at least put it into an asset that's worth it in the long run.


I'm not angry, I was just completely floored by your numbers.
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:05:40
Wtf, mediocre car for 500 a month? Are you high? You can flat out buy an old civic for ~4,000.
Also 3k for rent? Wtf are you smoking? Why would someone on a fixed income live in downtown New York City?
Nice suburb places in nice cities can be had for 1.5k easy.
