That software picks a chain to validate. It's reasonable to refer to the chain it picks as Bitcoin Core, especially now that there are multiple Bitcoin chains.

Only on ~~Coinbase~~Ticketmaster, the convenience is nice but you have other options
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:52:16
Is a $5 processing fee on Ticketmaster a problem for USD?
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:37:09
It's not bitcoins fault that you're using services that don't allow you to specify fees

Gemini fucked up with their 2x support but I still think it's the best exchange for BTC/USD. Hopefully they learn something from this, it makes them look amateur.

They've all mysteriously transformed into BCH trolls

It's a conservative position but ultimately they just gave 2x more legitimacy.

LOL okay if you say so. I'm going to bet on real anonymity though.

A more competent shitcoin then BTG which was still able to totally fuck up the entire crypto market

Limit buy for the most you want to spend, it will purchase at the lowest available price up to the limit
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:32:59
No, it isn't. It also doesn't exist yet. BTC isn't ever going to be anonymous.

It was on Bitfinex. One person filled the order, the price crashed for a few minutes then stabilized. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:07:32
BTG is a random shitcoin. B2X is the fork that matters.
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:39:39
High, or maybe low
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:19:04
Monero isn't BTC, adding those kinds of protections to bitcoin would constitute a hard fork

Several exchanges are providing corporate services, I know Gemini and Kraken do
