It's an attack against Bitcoin! /s
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:23:58
You are not really missing anything. Bitcoin fees are above $20 average, everyone prays hodl, people who have no idea what Bitcoin is are buying it. It's not a payment system anymore, people call it a store of value. But it's a huge bubble currently and will eventually pop and hopefully fix its issues someday.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:36:12
This is nothing. We were at $8k just 1 month ago lol. Wouldn't be surprised if we get back there within a few days.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:31:27
Upvoted for an actual answer to the question
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:08:08
Probably worth mentioning that it might be way too early to buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:04:27
An unhealthy drop? Not a bubble? Okay, let's see... over 200k unconfirmed transactions, average transaction fee over $20, Segwit adoption is very low after months, Lightning adoption is still years away, dozens of altcoins with superior transaction capacity, people who have no idea what a blockchain is are buying in masses out of FOMO.
Good luck with your healthy drop buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:58:24
most likely 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:03:05
Guys, remember that high fees are always a result of transaction spam attacks. Transaction fees can't even become high from real demand, it's impossible. Bitcoin is the future. Just hodl strong.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:31:31
Yeah, I went back to Paypal. But that was not really a voluntary decision, there is simply no better option since Bitcoin became unusable for smaller payments and the merchants I regulary use do not accept other cryptos yet. So I am upset. Won't be upset anymore once some other good cryptos become accepted by more merchants.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:06:10
Andreas clearly said that there is no "real Bitcoin" because in a decentralized system there is no authority which can determine legitimacy. He said that those forks will probably co-exist forever. He does not think this is an attack, lol. You should probably read up how forks work in open source software.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:59:23
buying back at 5k
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:14:24
Isn't this a major flaw in Bitcoin though? How do you expect the users to make decisions in a highly technical system once mass adoption is reached? 
Works well when there is only technically interested people using Bitcoin because they care and try to understand and participate. But the majority doesn't even care enough to try to inform themselves, so someone else must decide for them.
And this someone are the big players. You can already see it now and it will become worse as more and more people join the network. Miners, exchanges and big merchants decide what they offer to their users and the vast majority will accept it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:53:15
Yes it would be a hard fork. And hard forks are very dangerous, we can not allow that.

@_date: 2017-12-22 02:47:02
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:53:32
gonna buy back at 5k, what's your strategy?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:19:42
I also want BTC to scale, I mean, who doesn't! I am very excited for LN.
The problem with the approach that Bitcoin is taking is that it's all or nothing. Currently it is nothing because 1mb is not sufficient at all to satisfy the demand of the increasing user base. With LN, scaling will be solved once and forever if it works as intended.
Now here is the problem: the meantime. The majority of the huge amount of new users will search for something that is at least usable, something that works. Something without a $50 transaction fee. Other projects can provide that, some can process 2, 3, 4, or 5 times as much transactions as the Bitcoin network. Of course this is no solution. No scaling. But this will still lead to some project dethroning BTC in terms of transaction throughput, market cap and real world usage.
Bitcoin is going a very safe way in terms of software development. But no company would ever go this way because the competition would crush it. Temporary fixes need to be deployed until the final solution is found if you want to maintain your position, you can't have a broken system and stay ahead of the competiton.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:44:48
I don't have a problem with the fees, I always move multiple Bitcoins when I transact. Fees are peanuts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:42:08
Because BCH can currently process up to 4 times more transactions than BTC. That means that a 100% transaction capacity use on BTC would result in a 25% capacity use on the BCH chain.
Imagine BTC would have 4MB blocks now. Would fees be cheaper with the same transaction amount?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:27:35
I am also an analyst and on top of that I am an expert. I am seeing $5k BTC very soon.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:11:19
We will be back at $5k soon, probably lower. $40k might happen in a few years if LN works as intended.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:08:14
That's simply not true, BCH can handle the same amount of transactions as BTC currently does and fees would be much lower than the current BTC fees.
What you probably read is that big blocks won't be a sufficient scaling solution for mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:36:14
I don't see your point... you were suggesting that the merchant trusts me instead of waiting for a confirmation, which means the transaction is reversible and I can fuck over the merchant. That seems like a bad solution to overcome the fee issue and I doubt that merchants will do that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:51:44
Do merchants really do that? What if I broadcast another transaction with a higher fee which will then be confirmed sooner, effectively replacing the first transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:09:26
I think this is a bug within the user interface, I doubt it is the real trading volume.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:15:05
No idea, that's too short of a timeframe. But I think that Bitcoin will continue to correct to lower levels within the next months, I'm expecting to see $5,000.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:55:30
this is gold
edit: thank you for the gold
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:11:13
Yeah right, there is not even a problem. Blocks are not full. Fees are optional. Just use second layer right now.
Meanwhile, median transaction fee above $10 LOL
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:26:34
True that. Pretty sure we will see $5,000 soon and it will still be an insane increase from just a few months ago. Bitcoin just went way too high, way too fast. Here comes the correction, it's always been like that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:10:12
That is not how it works, difficulty is in direct relation to security. With a total reward of 0.005 BTC for finding a block, the network would be more than 3000 times less secure than it is now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:59:41
As a business it makes no sense for BitPay to invest money to help the development of a particular cryptocurrency.
They are a payment processor for cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency itself won't go anywhere, this sector will grow.
Smartest thing for them is just to offer payments for the top coins with the most demand, that's it. They just follow the market and add/remove the coins that the market wants and does not want.
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:42:40
I didn't assume that a central authority would roll back the transactions. You still can't claim immutability when you agree to rollback transactions in case a bug happens.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:15:19
I don't know but 300kb blocks is what u/luke-jr, the legendary Core developer, proposed and I fully trust his knowledge.

RemindMe! 1 week "how did that go?"
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:05:10
Yes, healthy. Bitcoin needs to be able to maintain a secure network even without a block reward in order to prepare for the time when inflation gets close to zero. Users will pay for this security in form of fees when the block reward is gone and therefore fees must be higher.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:08:23
Really shows how much room there is for a real correction
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:18:27
Which is maybe enough to cover all daily transactions in one small town.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:46:35
In the case you described you would need to trust 2 third parties. You will need to trust Coinbase with your Bitcoin. And you will need to trust that BitPay delivers your payment to the merchant. If either of them fucks you over, your payment won't reach the merchant and your money is gone.
This channel would only remove the trust between Coinbase and BitPay. The customer still needs to trust both of them though. Much innovation!
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:18:15
I second this. 1mb is already too much, look at how many spam transactions we have. I hope the community gets its shit together soon and hardforks to something like 300kb to make these attacks unattractive.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:43:06
That is what has been deducted from your wallet, basically what you have sent.
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:51:09
Just curious, what's your opinion?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:08:49
Hard forks are extremely dangerous, Bitcoin should not hard fork to 4mb. The current fee market is very healthy for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:11:36
This is true. Real Bitcoin needs to have 1mb forever. Or 300kb, that would also be okay.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:04:41
BTC increased more than 1,000% since January this year. Meanwhile, transaction fees are higher than ever, confirmations take hours and Bitcoin adoption is decreasing (e.g Steam removing Bitcoin as payment option).
I think it will correct much more, the recent bull run was mostly irrational.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:25:15
It will work with faith.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:49:43
sounds like a ponzi
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:22:07
This seems like a very bad solution though, one of Bitcoins critical features is that you can not reverse transactions. Taking that away seems a bad idea, especially for merchants.

Pick one.
Legitimacy can only be determined by authority. There is no such thing in Bitcoin.
There is no "real Bitcoin", there is just different networks and different people with different preferences and opinions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:05:23
I am not concerned, lol. And there is not really a problem, it's just weird to me that people are so convinced of the success of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an idea in the first place and there are now dozens of competing implementations of this idea. One will most likely make it but it is unlikely that it is BTC and that is nothing bad. It is only important that the idea survives.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:15:49
Price crashes less fast. People want to deposit BTC to an exchange to sell it but they can't because their transaction takes hours or even days.
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:03:09
BTC is way too volatile to be a store of value. If my country would have a crises, I would also buy USD and not BTC. That's because BTC is too small, new, unregulated and therefore risky.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:17:41
I plan to sell at 5k
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:38:27
That is your transaction fee. The fee is very low, you will probably need to wait a week or so until this transaction goes through.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:20:03
Implementations by the big players are still years away, it won't be implemented immediately when it's ready. Look at Segwit, it's out since months, adoption is very low.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:00:40
Bitcoin is not "zero" and never will be, I am just saying that at this point it is unlikely that it will maintain its position. And I am already well diversified into other projects.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:05:33
Only a few people can sell or buy during heavy price swings, it's been like this for months. Exchanges can't handle the current amount of users. You can place your orders when the price is stable.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:55:24
Bitcoin won't hold its first position until LN is adopted though. At this point it is pretty certain that a different project will take over in terms of market cap and daily transaction volume.

Adoption did not increase since last year, transactiom volume is about the same. But on the other side there are much more bagholders than last year, people who bought high and are now waiting to break even after their get-rich-quick plan didn't work out so well. They will loose hope as the time goes on without another bull market. Also, Bitcoin can now be shorted by institutional investors. This gives more balance and prevents growing bubbles like the last one because big players can make a killing by betting against it. I think we will go much lower.

Look at your quote. You found a good argument why Bitcoin should not be called bcore. Then I told you that the exact same thing is true for Bitcoin Cash. Once you learned that, you are just ignoring it, looking for other arguments and still calling it bcash. You know how this is called? Hypocrite.

So Bitcoin will never be able to change any consensus rules and therefore never be able to upgrade to more than 1mb blocks? I'm confused now... why did the community even have this huge blocksize debate for years then if it isn't possible for Bitcoin to make any blocksize increase anyway?
And isn't it a huge disadvantage to have a protocol that can never be upgraded? I mean... that sounds terrible. Technology always advances and there will come up better solutions than we have now but they can never be implemented as long as they require to change consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:50:51
Okay, I think I understand a little better now... so users actually decide which chain is the "true" Bitcoin and therefore labeled as Bitcoin (BTC) on exchanges and wallets by just **using** the chain they prefer? Would that mean that "Bitcoin" will be whatever chain is being used the most after the fork?
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:19:40
Nodes define consensus? That sounds pretty unsecure, everyone can deploy thousands of nodes with relatively low cost and therefore corrupt the consensus. I thought Bitcoin was using proof of work as consensus mechanism to avoid such easy attacks?
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:21:00
This. In order to use Bitcoin you don't need to know how it works, at all. Just like with our current monetary system. You just need to know how to send a transaction through a GUI wallet which is pretty easy, probably easier than online banking and it will just become easier and easier as more merchants adopt crypto. Scanning a QR code, press "Send". Done.
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:29:47
Did you actually look at the charts? The statement is true but it is very misleading. See for yourself:
[BTC Hashrate](
[BCH Hashrate](
The BCH ATH was caused by a spike from 0.5E to 20E in a few days. This was due to the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment which BCH used to survive, this lead many BTC miners to switch back and forth between the BTC and BCH chain to maximize their profits.
Not accounting for that ATH, the BCH hashrate was rather between 0.5E and 1E during that time and has been slowly increasing since then. Now it's at around 5E. The hashrate growth of BCH in percentage since then is very similar to BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-02 10:38:30
How so?
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:23:06
And that's why you need to downvote everyone who is in favor of BCH, even though when this person is presenting valid arguments in a discussion? Because that's what my comment refers to.
You can be against BCH but in my opinion it should not be necessary that someone needs to start his comment with "I am for BTC and small blocks" in order to present an argument that goes against the agenda of this sub.
@_date: 2018-06-05 09:44:33
Funny that you need to mention that you support BTC and small blocks before you start to speak the truth. It really shouldn't matter if you support BTC or BCH when you are simply adding some valuable information to the discussion.
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:43:46

@_date: 2018-06-07 09:49:17


I was only talking about the percentage increase since then (see what you quoted), which is pretty similar:
BCH went from 1E to 5E, that's a 5x increase.
BTC went from 6E to 36E, that's a 6x increase.
Of course, the BTC miners could 51% attack BCH, not gonna argue that. But that wasn't my point, I just wanted to show that this Twitter post is intentionally misleading. People should not blindly believe such statements just because it fits their agenda, that doesn't do them any good.

But since the external valuation is not static, it's the only thing that matters when looking at fees. You can't tell if a sat/byte fee is low or high if you don't know the external valuation of a sat.

No, but I think speculators have no right to complain about anything with a *muh money* argument. They don't contribute anything. They are just abusing a system that was not made for speculation. So if it doesn't work out, the only one to blame is themselves.

@_date: 2018-06-05 22:12:38
Speculators alone can't provide long term value because they are waiting to sell their coins to the next sucker for a profit. This only works if the underlying asset has some use case outside of speculation, else it's just a ponzi. Transaction volume is the right metric to look at for adoption.
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:56:13


Not sure what you mean by "it pretends". Bitcoin Cash is a protocol, just like Bitcoin. A protocol can't pretend anything. Some advocates can pretend something but it is ridiculous to judge a decentralized network by some prominent figures.
Besides that, BCH has a very different plan for scaling. The BCH community prefers on-chain scaling and BTC community prefers off-chain scaling. That sets it apart from BTC because scaling is a big and important topic.
I am glad that both exist because this way there is a bigger chance that at least one of the two scaling solutions succeeds. Would be worse if people would only try one solution.
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:44:25
So you do believe that BCH would just vanish if Bitmain and Roger Ver disappear?
If you truly believe that, then I understand your argument.But I don't see how that would work. 
If Bitmain stops mining BCH, other miners will happily fill their place. Most miners threat this like a business, they mine for profit and not because they believe in something. And that's how POW has been designed to work.
If Roger Ver stops to be involved in BCH, then what? BCH will have less advertisement, less exposure. But that won't make it go away. There are many regular people who really like and use BCH.
BCH has multiple development teams, different wallets and it is supported by many exchanges and payment processors.
I know that many people in this sub very much dislike BCH. But that is no excuse to dismiss the reality and say that it would just fade away without Bitmain and people like Roger Ver.
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:33:08

Okay, I get your point of view now. That's pretty idealistic but also a little dreamy. What you describe is a revolution, a fight of the people against the government and fiat.
I don't see that happening anytime soon in the western world, people are too comfortable and your mind-set isn't the general mind-set of Bitcoiners. Over 90% of the people who currently buy Bitcoin do it to eventually increase their fiat holdings.
How can I tell? Watch this sub, there is price talk everywhere. It's not about the technology and government disruption, it's about how much USD one Bitcoin is worth. People are even welcoming regulation as they hope this will drive the price up. People who think like you are a tiny minority of the people who made Bitcoin so popular and expensive.

Please don't just blindly believe what people tell you. The average opinion here about this topic is not objective but very extreme.

Why would that mean that crypto can't work? To me it seems that it would only mean that Bitcoin didn't work. Better consensus and governance models can be developed.

You need to have BTC if you want to receive B2X, so if you sell your BTC now, you are also selling your potential B2X that you would receive. I am not sure I understand your argument... BTC is worth around $7000 now and everyone knows it splits in two weeks into B1X and B2X, and people see that B2X could be worth $2000. If the $2000 are not included in the $7000 price, you can now pay $7000 and receive $9000 in 2 weeks. Doesn't make much sense to me, this is at least not the expected outcome. The B2X price is included in the BTC price for sure, the question is just how things will develop after the fork.
But I am interested where BTC futures trade for $6700 - $7200 because then I could sell by BTC futures + B2X futures for around $9k, re-buy BTC for $7k and repeat that until I am filthy rich. Did I miss something?

That's also something very different, due to many reasons.
Governments can prevent all merchants to accept Bitcoin. They can shut down all exchanges. Then what do you do with your Bitcoin?
You can trade them in person with other people who agree to take the risk of being caught, just like with drugs.
Now, the thing is that Bitcoin is supposed to be money. When the government decides to fight it, they prevent you to buy any products with it. They also prevent it to be traded through the banking system. 
Then it's only some kind of illegal underground gold which you can trade for cash and "store of value" is its only utility.
Thinking that governments have no power to reduce the usage of Bitcoin to very few and tech-savy people is just naive.

Weird what people here consider a store of value. It's not that hard, the meaning is literally in the name. *Store* of *value*. Please tell the people who bought BTC within the last 3 months that BTC is a store of value, they might ask you why they lost 80% of the value they tried to store.
It's just speculation, Bitcoin isn't a store of value because it increases 1,000% in a year and falls 80% afterwards.
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:22:43
What you describe just isn't a store of value. Stability and low risk are the most important properties of a store a value, Bitcoin meets none of them. Something with a lot of volatility can not be a store of value. A speculative investment can not be a store of value. A store of value does not increase 1,000% in a year. A store of value does not lose 80% of its value in a year. You can't just take a term and change its properties so that it fits Bitcoin.

All Bitcoin rules are defined by code. Every part of the code can theoretically be changed by people. You have to trust the participants of the network to never agree on changing the maximum supply.
Bitcoin revolutionizes trust because you do not have to trust a single entity anymore, may it be a government, an organization or a company. But therefore you put your trust into the network as a whole which is defined by all its participants. Changing rules in Bitcoin is very difficult because you need the support of the vast majority of the network.
Increasing the maximun supply does not benefit participants of the network because it decreases the value per coin. You trust in human selfishness here.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:58:47
So how did that go?
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:27:43
Noo, I know what you think. But think again.
You have two chains with equal difficulties. What other miners do does not affect your chance to find a block at all. 99% of miners can mine the B2X chain and you can mine the B1X chain and it will still be more profitable if the price of B1X is higher than the price of B2X price. The only metric that will affect profitability right after the fork will be the price of each coin; until the difficulty adjusts.
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:21:18
They were pretty specific when they said they will follow the chain with the "most accumulated difficulty". This just means they will follow the chain which took the most hashpower to be created.
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:41:54

It is true that the average person will use what the state offers but govermment issued cryptos won't compete with Bitcoin at all, no one from Bitcoin will change to CryptoRuble and no one who uses CryptoRuble won't use Bitcoin because of that.
Bitcoin is currently mainly used as a speculative asset. People buy it because they hope it will rise in value in the future. Government issued currencies won't be increasing in value, they will be stable like fiat.
The second use case is coming from people who like the decentralized aspect. Nobody controls it or can seize it. Government issued cryptos are centralized and can be seized.
There is really 0 competition there. Completely different use cases. Government issued currencies are just a digital fiat.

Do you mind to explain why their validation matters though?
Let's assume that 95% of all economic nodes (miners, exchanges, wallets, merchants, payment processors etc.) switch to new consensus rules and the majority of users just does not care and continues to use their services. The big majority of transactions will then be done on the chain with new consensus rules. It will have more hashpower, more merchants, more exchanges and more users.
Still, the majority of full nodes will be running the old client and validate blocks from the old chain. But except having more full nodes, they will have less of everything else (hashpower, merchants, exchanges, users...). Obviously the market cap of the old chain will then also be much lower than the market cap of the new chain.
I can't see how people who are running full nodes at home get to decide anything because the majority of all transactions is broadcasted by economic nodes. Users decide by choosing what exchanges they use, what wallets they use, where they purchase things with their bitcoins. But if 95% of all exchanges, wallets and merchants agree on new consensus rules and the majority of users don't boycott them, I can't see how some tiny minority of people who run a foll node at home gets to say anything.
Please explain to me how the tiny minority of Bitcoin users who run a non-economic full node matters if almost all miners, merchants and exchanges turn against them and the users who don't run a full node just don't care and continue to use all those services. Because I just can't see it.

There is no way that miners will mine the B2X chain for 2 or 3 months at a loss. If they stick together and have enough discipline, they could all mine the B2X chain at a loss for some days, maybe even 1 or 2 weeks but not months. Eventually, the market will sort this out, miners don't really have a choice. They can fight the market for only a very limited amount of time because they don't have unlimited money to burn.

Well, that depends where you look. In r/Bitcoin you will hardly be able to miss the hatred against S2X. But people who only read here about Bitcoin are like children growing up among ISIS members. Small chance they are going to be christians.
I am not a fan of either side, for different reasons. I would tend to the legacy chain if it wasn't this community. Everyone is crying and hating, screaming for lawsuits and fighting about what other people call their chain. It's so pathetic.
But back to the consensus... Well, I agree with you that hashrate does not define consensus on its own. The users also indirectly vote with their money. But I think that there is a big problem with that which will become bigger as Bitcoin gets more users. Businesses like Coinbase or Bitpay can decide for their users and the users can only decide against that by leaving the service. Well and now guess what... the bigger Bitcoin gets, the smaller will the percentage of users be who will have the political and technical interest to follow any debates in Bitcoin. So, in the end, the big businesses will be able to make the decisions because the big crowd doesn't care enough to boycott them.

Make it illegal by law. This will force exchanges to shut down and merchants to drop it as a payment option. This will kill a lot of the current speculation and have a negative price impact, short term and long term.

There isn't really any explanation in there which makes sense to me. If you hold 1 BTC on Coinbase now, you will have 1 B1X and 1 B2X after the fork. How is it unsafe? You will have both coins. It doesn't matter what they name those coins, the name does not change what they are.

It is definetely a good idea to try forcing S2X. Because then we will know if businesses and miners have enough influence to decide about protocol changes without consensus among the users.
If so, Bitcoin was determined to fail right from the start and the sooner we know, the better. Other projects with better consensus mechanisms will be developed and have their chance. Eventually, something will be found that can survive.
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:47:52

And what is this weird *proof of work* consensus algorithm that they talk about?
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:07:35
Oh god, this is wrong on so many levels.
This isn't meant bad and I'm not pro S2X but you don't understand what Proof of Work is. You were citing this from the whitepaper:


*Node* in this context is any node in the network, including what you call *miners*. And *voting with CPU power* has nothing to do with transaction verification and propagation of blocks between nodes, it means mining, Proof of Work. Consensus on the protocol level is defined by hashpower. On the protocol level, users like you and me can only vote with our CPU power when we are mining. This is a pretty low voice compared to big mining pools.
What people refer to when they say *Bitcoin is not ruled by miners* is that users can indirectly vote with their buying power, the users are the market. Miners can decide to mine a new chain and the old chain may suffer due to slow block times and a less secure network but eventually the users will decide with their money. Miners can only ignore the market a short time because they don't have infinite money to burn.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:43:42
The price is currently driven by speculation, not by utility. If all countries would ban it, it would not go up anymore. Oh boy and how it would go down!
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:51:07
That's cool and works for every individual but then you can't ask everyone else (other users, other miners, exchanges, wallets, merchants) that they also call Bitcoin what you call Bitcoin. What Bitcoin is to you might then not be the same as what Bitcoin is to 99% of the world.
Many Bitcoin Cash users for example do exactly what you described. They say it's the real Bitcoin to them, when they say "Bitcoin" they refer to what the majority of the world calls "Bitcoin Cash". And it works just fine for them I guess, why wouldn't it? Like you said, every person with a group of similar thinking persons can decide what Bitcoin is for themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:08:40
Yes but they work on one client which implements the Bitcoin protocol. It's not a good idea that everyone runs the same software; if a critical bug occurs, the whole network will be affected. Also a very limited amount of people have commit access to the repository and could abuse their power. It would be way better if the community used different clients, minimizing the risk of a total failure.

@_date: 2017-10-08 16:33:23
Obviously you need to verify transactions but you also need to trust that the network will operate as intended. If the network would have a critical bug which for example causes blocks not to be propagated anymore, then there is nothing for you to verify anymore because you don't receive any new blocks.
So you don't trust the network? Doesn't really matter how it performs?

Well that would be $6000 for 12 months. That is not so unlikely anymore but still just a gamble. Bitcoin is not guaranteed to go up from here, the price could be lower in 1 year than it is now.
The first rule is to not invest more than you are willing to lose. If those $15k are important to you and you need them in a year, it is not a good idea to rely on Bitcoin. Especially with a fixed timeframe because nobody knows when it goes up or down; a true Bitcoin believer also won't tell you that the price will be higher in 1 year. He believes that eventually the price will go up, for example it will be higher in 20 years than it is now. But 1 year is too short of a timeframe for anyone to tell.
In the end, *don't invest more than you can afford to lose* is important in Bitcoin because the whole project could also completely fail and leave the price at 0.
Do not rely on money that you put into Bitcoin. It is highly speculative.

Both coins combined will most likely have a lower price than the BTC price will be pre-fork.
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:09:23
Yeah, you are probably right. Obviously Bitcoin wouldn't die, people carry on. But excluding the US economy means excluding lots of money, it would still have a bad short term (FUD, panic sellers) and a bad long term (businesses in the US can't interact with Bitcoin anymore) effect on the price.

* If you make a small mistake then your entire savings are gone (forgot to do proper backups, sent to the wrong address, got hacked)
* Crypto is barely accepted anywhere
* Crypto is too volatile to be used as money
* Crypto UX is pretty bad
Some of the reasons why the world still uses fiat. Most of these issues can be improved over the following years but the first point can never be solved because it's phisically impossible. That's because even in the best case (multiple backups, offline wallet, good knowledge of the network) someone can come to your house, hold a gun to your face and demand your seed and passphrase. It's basically like having all your money under your mattress. You will need a middlemen service with an insurance (like uhm... a bank?) to solve this problem.

Okay, now I understand what you mean. But you missunderstood what Coinbase stated. They will give you **both** coins, they made that very clear. It does not make any difference for you how they name each chain. To correct your example:
Say you have 50 BTC on Coinbase before the fork. After the fork, they decide that B2X is the "real" Bitcoin and list it as "BTC". You will still have your B1X tokens aswell though. Let's say they name them "Bitcoin 1MB" and list it as "B1X". You will have 50 of those coins too!
It does not matter how they name them. You can withdraw them to your Bitcoin Core wallet and there you go, it's "Bitcoin" again. But it always was Bitcoin anyways, doesn't matter how Coinbase calls it. Do you understand where you got it wrong?
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:02:26


How is it not safe to use? You will have both coins. Do you feel unsafe when they give your favorite coin a name that you don't like?

Not an answer to your question but an alternative to your plan: use [Shamir's Sharing Secret](

You can also google for a different implementation.

@_date: 2017-10-17 22:40:06
Oh yeah, ad hominem is the way to go.
I am talking about bugs which break the functionality of the network. Imagine a bug causes clients to stop propagating blocks. If it is the only client that is being used, the whole network will stop working. If you have 4-5 different protocol implementations on the other side, only 20% - 25% of the network would have a fallout and it would still be operating fine.
I mean come on, you seriously wanna argue for a single software implementation in a distributed system? That is beyond ridiculous.

Robbed of buying power? The USD is a currency, inflation is necessary for a growing economy. You don't want to incentivice people to hoard money, they should be incentiviced to spend it. It's not an investment after all. You can go to the stock market for that. Nobody is robbing you, a currency is just not meant to be hoarded over decades.

He probably meant to do it after the hardfork. 
Anything else does not make much sense because even if you are 100% confident about BU, you don't know if the community will ever find consensus, the BU hardfork is no sure thing.
It is two seperate things to believe in BU as a technology and to believe that it will ever find consensus.

That strongly depends on what your goals are. Do you want to use cryptos, support an idea or just profit?
I guess you are talking about profit and the answer to that is probably that it may be better to diversify into other cryptos aswell. Especially because different cryptos have the intention to solve different problems.
Bitcoin wants to be a digital currency.
Ethereum wants to be the world computer, a decentralized virtual machine that offers the ability to have programmable money.
Ripple wants to be a service for banks.
Monero wants to be a digital currency with focus on anonymous transactions which attracts darknet users.
Sia wants to be a decentralized cloud storage network.
And so on... There won't be "the one crypto" that fits all needs. There will be many succesful cryptos for many different use cases. Bitcoin will maybe be the leading digital currency for some time but other cryptos will be leaders in other aspects.
Do some research and you will find your favorite cryptos.

Pretty good video... the video is from 3 years ago and he already saw the future impact of smart contracts, completely private transactions, decentralized storage and prediction markets.

You are ignoring future potential. Obviously BCC will be mined at a loss until the difficulty adjustment. But those who do so will do it under the assumption that being in control of this chain after eating the loss will be worth it.

You truly believe that humanity reached its perfect currency with Bitcoin?
Even if it would be possible someday to scale Bitcoin for mass adoption, I think Bitcoin is by far not the end product of what Blockchain technology enables us to do. There is much more to discover and I am sure Bitcoin is just one phase of what will come.
There will be more decentralized, more scalable, more secure and reliable networks with better governance in the future. Humanity has proven that again and again. Technology doesn't stop here.

If there would be a fiat bubble popping, goods and services would be increasing heavily in price.
@_date: 2017-06-16 23:18:19
That is just politics, BitPay will eventually follow the chain that will have the most hashpower and thus be labeled "BTC" on the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:36:58
Depends on what you define as "adoption". There is for sure many new people who educate themselves about Bitcoin and agree about the fundamentals, know the votality and still want to use it to escape fiat and corruption, be their own bank and use it as a longterm store of value. That is healthy.
But there is also many new people who don't educate themselves about Bitcoin, don't care about any fundamentals, people who don't even know what a blockchain is, neither they care. They use it as a get-rich-quick scheme because they read about the recent surge somewhere and that is not healthy at all. Those poeple are the reason the bubble will pop because they will be the ones selling in a huge panic when the growth is not sustainable anymore and shit starts to drop heavily.
@_date: 2017-06-10 00:04:31
That was indeed an interesting read, thank you for that!
Though I am still unsure whether that means that Bitcoin itself has any intrinsic value. To me, it seems more like Blockchain technology may have intrinsic value because it enables us to develope and use peer-to-peer electronic cash systems.
But that doesn't give any specific network like Bitcoin intrinsic value. People only might choose one network over the other, thus giving it value.
The ability for everyone to easily copy and reproduce the whole code destroys the intrinsic value, doesn't it? That is why the value comes from the people who decide to use and believe in a certain network.
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:09:09
Because Bitcoin on the other hand has intrinsic value above zero?
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:03:29
Yes, I totally agree with you.
I just sometimes see people who claim that full nodes decide what Bitcoin is. Well, that might sound nice but to me it seems nothing more than a naive dream. For that to be true, the vast majority of Bitcoin users would need to run their own full nodes and use them as their wallets but exactly the opposite is true, it is a tiny minority.
The way I understand it so far is that miners follow money. They will mine whatever chain is more profitable and the users will give the chain value. So, the users do decide. But not by running full nodes because most users just don't do that. Users decide by choosing which exchanges they use, which wallets they use and where they use their Bitcoin to buy goods and services. Because by using third party services, the users indirectly support whatever consensus rules those third parties implement.
I am not specifically speaking about 2x, I don't know how that will play out. This is more about the general theory of who decides and how they decide.
And I am afraid that the more users the Bitcoin network will have, the easier it will be for the major players (miners, exchanges, wallets, payment processors) to do closed-door meetings and agree on consensus rules on their own. That's simply because a very big crowd of users consists of average Joes who do not care. Take Facebook as an example. Major privacy concerns? Who the fuck cares, users want their convinience.
The same will apply to Bitcoin more than ever when the general public starts to use it more and more. Do you think that the average Joe will boycott Coinbase or whatever service that they are used to just because it implements some technical consensus rules that Joe does not understand anyways?
