Wouldn’t that crush the value/tech of all other coins?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:10:01
I would like to but they want to take a damn century to verify my account(over a week) when I watched NEO go from $35 to $80 in a week. Killing me. Don’t have any other way to get into the game. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:01:56
I’ve been waiting to get verified for over a week on Gemini. It’s killing me. Send support emails. Nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:02:30
Mines been over a week. You?
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:10:47
Can't make everybody laugh with crypto satire! If you'd like to help me write for these hit me up!
@_date: 2019-03-06 13:58:28
It’s my template for a comic. That wasn’t my intention at all. These damn things take around three hours and I’ve done 77 now. The least I could do is have a space for a tip to just MAYBE let this be sustainable. At least I’m actively trying to spread awareness for next to nothing but my time. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 16:46:41
Yeah he actually picked it up a year ago. I'm just taking the picture. : )
@_date: 2019-03-06 14:00:18
Paying homage. I do crypto comics and thought I’d imply bitcoin as being the firestarter. Don’t think too much into it. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 15:53:42
Heck yeah. Boobs rule.
@_date: 2019-03-01 16:43:36
Wait a second. How do you know this?
@_date: 2019-03-02 05:09:08
Lol whatever. If you don’t comprehend any of that you don’t have a good feel for what’s going on then. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 17:47:39
Dear God no... This girl is why people make fun of cryptocurrency. Who ever thinks she's the "coolest" should never be able to judge what's cool.
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:34:33
Crypto hasn't even touched adoption yet which is inevitable and will result in unfathomable gains. It's naive or predatory to not warn your friends to hedge their bets against hyper inflation or the countless ways government issued fiat can fail.
@_date: 2019-03-01 02:13:39
It's not at all. Old traditional guys will just look for excuses to not understand it. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 21:12:28
Yeah the hype is dead, but crypto going to smack that shit up in the next ten years.
@_date: 2019-03-06 13:57:58

Thanks brother!
@_date: 2019-03-01 22:08:55
It’s pretty close Crypto is inevitable. Look at the supply chain. Anything that cuts a link out in the supply chain is cheaper and nearly always becomes standard. Crypto does just that. Cuts out the intermediate between the transaction. Ask any business owner if they would like to avoid paying AMEX fees every month. Quantum computing or a massive EMP are the only threat to crypto, and MAYBE a stablecoin but that’s a segregated organization against the internet. 
Those who buy now around 100 billion market cap when the market cap will reach multi trillions(excluding potential from tokenized securities) after adoption you’d be foolish to think unfathomable gains aren’t going to happen to a lot of people. 
It makes perfect sense. If you’re going to finger point and name call I could take the same path by saying you’re just  a bit too dense. Look at Venezuela. It’s a warzone and citizens can’t get any wealth out of the country due to hyper inflation. However, They would be able to had their full wealth not been allocated in Bollivars locked up in a banking system that doesn’t have any of their money to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 02:27:43
Ahh yeah. That was the first one I did in the piece. I started getting more detailed on their representations further in. Charlie Lee was a bit tough to draw from the profile. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:45:27
Nailed the first three. Tim Draper is actually the 4th. From left side is Charlie Lee, Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, Noriel Roubini, Brian Armstrong, Blythe Masters, Satoshi, Nick Szabo, Vitalik Buterin, Tim Draper, Nathan Rothschild, Warren Buffet, and JP Morgan. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:25:05
Yeah nice catch as Judas. I thought about it, but since mostly all of my engagement is in the Twitter community, Nouriel Roubini pretty much set Twitter on fire the past few weeks so I decided to go that route... He blocked me, and pretty much anybody with an association to crypto.
@_date: 2018-10-25 18:52:17
Sincerely appreciate it. I honestly don't post much of my stuff on my website anymore because I hope to add them as digital collectibles one day if I can get some good press for the mural. Leave up a few of them so people like yourself can see if they want. It's been really hard sometimes doing this amount of work but I just keep my head down hoping it'll be worth it in the future.
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:13:30
I've done one with him. I've got an insanely massive mural I've been working on all year which I'm hoping to finish at the end of the year. I mostly post stuff to my Twitter account  Try to release 3 comics a week. Thanks for the comment!
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:15:55
Thanks a lot. Spent a lot of time on this. I'm putting together a massive crypto mural I've been working on for almost half of the year, and not sure about how to get it out there. That is the 62nd comic I've done this year so just got to figure out how to get them out a bit better. I post most of my stuff on my Twitter account  Thanks for commenting. Very much appreciated.
@_date: 2018-10-23 17:29:32
@_date: 2018-10-23 14:36:10
Bonus points if you can name everybody in the picture. They are all real Bankers/Ex-bankers/Crypto visionaries.
@_date: 2018-10-24 02:48:01
Thanks a lot man. Wasn’t taking it that way just trying to get an absurd amount of crypto people on this mural in the grand scheme of things. Kind of hard to explain. Should finish it towards end of year though. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:42:01
You mean... Your private seed?
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:57:29
Gee... Wow. Thanks for your thoughts!
@_date: 2019-02-27 21:35:25
Did it with a combination of Adobe Animate for drawing, and effects through Adobe Illustrator. Thanks man!
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:36:03
Thanks a lot man. Spent absurd hours on this. Now just got to figure out how and what to do with it ha.
@_date: 2018-06-03 17:32:22
I apologize... I deleted the other posts.
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:56:34
It's great actually. Your smugness isn't. This sort of content is needed for adoption.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:43:57
That’s awesome. Would love for him to acknowledge this. Actually like three characters he did on here. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:42:40
Yeah mate. The bankers water boarded me and took a few fingers off cause they didn’t want me to make this. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 13:24:30
Every single person on here had a part in the events of 2018. You tuber reviewers/Ian Ballina Evernote joke/Kraken exchange... literally the list is endless. Could comment on every inch of the painting. People need to do things like this to appeal to mass audience. Media has told the world crypto is terrible I spent all year trying to make it interesting. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:54:17
He's next to the caged John C Reilly on the left side or Man Bear Whale is laughing on the right side putting his finger under the nose of the guy behind the blackboard.
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:00:21
Probably went splat on that Tesla car Elon musk launched out into orbit. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 23:05:12
I would like to speak to girlsgonebitcoin!
@_date: 2019-02-01 02:21:42
He's right in the front talking to Santa Clause. Don't think I nailed him to be honest. You can see his nametag behind the Lambo front windshield.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:25:11
Haha thanks so much. Feels really good to finish this project.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:19:09
Doge wins always.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:13:24
Thanks man. Wanted to do something kind of dark with funny characters. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 23:04:02
So you like Monero. That’s fair. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:32:06
Would love to accept doge! I am only accepting bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:41:30
Yeah man, I understand. I was just happy to have accomplished this and wanted to get in the picture. I do have some more pictures here. Not the full high res one for obvious reasons but close up pictures and a png. [
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:40:04
The piece is so massive, and such high gloss reflective surface I was afraid it wouldn't fit in the frame to the point where you could see enough detail in the picture and have the dog on the floor to make it in the frame. Not like I wanted to hold him but wanted to make sure he'd comfortably get in the frame so you could see the doge.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:56:22
If you guys would like to see how it evolved, check out this progress video I made through out it. [ Thanks again. Gianni  (Twitter)
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:36:26
I'll take it!
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:59:17
Yeah I'm not in love with the name. I did it mostly for SEO purposes. The pun is supposed to be intended towards theft is what everyone is scared about in crypto however these are the people actually moving it forward.
@_date: 2019-02-01 02:22:08
Yeah man. Trying to offer different options of this. The super high quality one is so crazy expensive to produce so I had to make other affordable options. Can see them all here. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 21:47:54
Thank you! I've done pretty decent on Twitter in the crypto community with this. My issue is we're such a niche, I'm trying to get this in front of virgin crypto eyes somehow. That being a high foot traffic area or something. It's really just trying to make crypto worth investigating to newbies.
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:51:58
It sure is!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:09:05
There are plenty females in there. Not everything is a male female debate on equality. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:54:03
No I’d consider. What’s a chain mail tour??
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:25:35
Yep! He's in the bottom right. Nailed it.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:06:17
Elon posting on twitter about Ethereum and that was a joke about him heading to the moon. If you look closely he’s thrown out the driver in the Tesla that’s flying around space. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:32:33
That’s ok. Might have to see it up close. Every character has a comic I made of him so I’d like to put those as collectibles on the blockchain but still need to figure everything out. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:23:52
Yeah man. Completely understand. Was just really excited to finish it and was a big accomplishment for me. I got some better pictures here. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:34:56
Nah man. He's 6 years old, and swear it's almost destiny haha. Didn't know about doge before, just wanted to get a shiba inu. Then got into crypto afterwards when the meme blew up. Just eerie.
@_date: 2019-02-03 19:36:21
Got me. Was flustered at how much of a obnoxious ignorant dickhead you sounded, I used the wrong word. You can still go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2019-02-02 04:04:56
This is what I needed. Thank you very much. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:36:47
Thanks so much. Took a lot of time to make this.
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:48:40
Sent a DM!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:12:36
Thanks so much. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:03:04
Well I'd use bitcoin to see boobs eventually.
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:16:13
Thanks for clarifying. Glad I learned something new today. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:10:34
I can assure you he's a wild animal.
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:30:48
Thanks so much man. Comments like this makes the year I lost making it worthwhile. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:02:10
Thanks man. They are a compilation of 64 crypto comics I made through out the year, and some animations I did on my YouTube channel.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:41:57
Yeah man thank you very much. I plan to do one every year. Already working on 2019. I post crypto comics which I use in the mural quite often on my twitter account 
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:14:45
It's a play on everything we're scared about it intentionally. The one panel comics (this mural is an accumulation of the 64 one panel comics I did to raise awareness on Twitter) are very adult satire so it's kind of just a middle finger to all the chaos to be frank.
@_date: 2019-02-02 13:18:02
Thanks for commenting man. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:55:07
I tried all that to no success. Nobody wants to support it that way. Figured I'd make a massive piece and hope somebody would buy it. No luck so far.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:19:02
Good Doge Boy
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:33:23
Haha definitely not that. It’s a hand sleeve and a stylus I used to draw it all. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:47:49
Thanks man! Just got to figure out how to raise awareness for this somehow. Would love to put it in a high traffic location.
@_date: 2019-02-01 17:13:08
Hell yeah. That’s kind of the style I’m going for. Dark cartoon with a bit of dark humor. Thanks for the great compliment 
@_date: 2019-02-01 02:21:52
Thanks a lot mate.
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:00:34
Thanks man!
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:51:37
Thanks man!
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:31:48
If you're going to try and be funny, at least be good at it. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:30:01
It’s not destroying it just trying to capture a part of history. There is no denying 2018 was one of the worst downturns in a market cycle, and that’s what that represents. The whole goal is to try and appeal to an audience outside of crypto and there are many mentions of bright future ahead in the piece. Look at the blackboard in the front. Shows a chart breaking off the top of the blackboard as “tomorrow”. Degrade centralized projects and bitcoin is portrayed in a positive light all over the place. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:51:32
THanks so much!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:36:47
No. So many people was hard to get guys in. Had to try and build a following at the same time. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:58:18
Ahh really cool idea!
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:06:46
Thanks. Glad you like the piece. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:47:11
Absolutely in there. He's on the phone behind the bull at the fireplace in the middle.
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:36:05
Thanks man. I really am hoping to just get myself out there with this at the moment. I’m kind of a nobody struggling ‘artist’ don’t like to call myself that haha. Just wish I knew how to get my name out there. And yes. That looks awesome. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:19:00
Yeah man. I don't know what to do with it at the moment. Hard to figure out getting this exposure. It's really not my forte. Just spent so much time on it I'm a little exhausted. Hoping I get a breath of fresh air soon.
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:01:02
Ya man. I've tried to every exhaustion. Nobody gives a shit haha. People are so difficult to get in touch with nowadays.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:24:43
Thank you so much.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:21:56
Yeah it's expensive, and I know that. However, I spent literally my entire year last year making this over 400 hours, and to produce this is crazy expensive. I found a new technique that prints RGB instead of CMYK on aluminum metal which results in almost a mirror like gloss and vivid colors. It costs me around $2,000 to get it to the customer.
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:54:51
It's a decentralized global exchange of value without a third party involved with their grubby hands. I don't want them to come back to take profits from them idiot. It's a hedge against fiat currency falling to one of the multiple problems to it's core. It's irresponsible to not own crypto currency as a financial hedge against hyper inflation actually.
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:29:06
That's the point mate. Got to see up close.
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:14:21
Satoshi, and the last supper is most recognizable. Every character on here was one of 64 crypto comics I made through posts on twitter. Took all the characters and put it on here. Christopher Walken, Notorious BIG, John C Reilly, Zack Morris, Al Capone, Elon Musk, Kanye West to name some famous people as well. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:50:27
Yeah I'm really not sure how the hell to play this. I've got a massive expensive style that is almost incomparable quality that I wanted to stick by but it's so damn expensive to produce. I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:21:47
He ABSOLUTELY is doing just that by the bar on the way right. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:26:15
Hahaha well shit? That got dark fast.
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:39:21
Shut up.
@_date: 2019-02-27 21:49:32
Doge got me to be honest. I'm his slave.
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:15:54
CZ is right under the Club Coinbase sign. Mcafee is eating his own dick at the bar on the right called RektAnus Tavern. Laura Shin was gunna put her at last supper but put Blythe Roades instead. Not sure why but just did. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:18:04
Yeah man! Become kind of friends with him through Twitter.
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:02:35
Is there a place in particular you can place it with big foot traffic? I would definitely consider it.
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:01:46
Ya that’s probably fair. However it’s literally foolish to not own at least a little crypto to hedge your bets on the future. This is a 10-15 year thing. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:03:05
Not expecting them to understand it, but I hope to capture their interest enough to investigate the satire.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:35:43
It is a Marvel movie premiere. : )
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:38:14
Thanks man. Spent nauseating hours on this, appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:15:14
Haha brother he's right in the front!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:38:18
Much doge
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:25:25
Ahhhh. Thank you! That was a really great role. I enjoyed my time on the set there.
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:00:17
It's cool man. No biggie.
@_date: 2019-02-02 13:19:40
Ya man I do sell this at my store  and the dog is a doge! Shiba inu! Named Samus! Thanks brotha appreciate the comment. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:35:37
Smack in the right middle of the piece. First few front people there.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:18:36
McAfee is on the right side eating his own dick at the bar haha.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:02:29
Yeah I didn’t know if I could get him in the frame and the picture look decent. It’s literally a mirror with the printing style and it’s so big it’s hard to get the whole thing in the frame in my apartment. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:26:12
Ya they are about awareness to start so I know where you're coming from. Those are collaborations with other Twitter accounts. As I got deeper and a bigger following it's more about making fun of what's relevant. I do know where you're coming from. I only posted a very few on my website. There are around 75 now that have been getting far better traction then the ones on my site.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:42:24
He's there! Standing up on the edge of the last supper scene with Satoshi. He's on the way left with a litecoin logo on his chair. You can see some more detail upclose here. [
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:48:08
Oh yes. He's at the bar to the way right about to munch on his pecker.
@_date: 2019-02-02 13:18:36
Of course! Thanks for the interest. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 13:27:23
Trying to make it appealing to people outside crypto. Media has told everyone crypto is evil. Trying to give them a reason to research it if you really want to know why I am doing this. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:10:02
He's holding me up actually. He's got super doggo powers.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:19:30
Of course! Extra tummy rubs for Samus.
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:27:35
It's not a lottery more of a foresight to an incredible technology.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:32:52
Well that’s a good doge then. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:52:59
When people don't listen... Is it worth saying something?
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:07:49
Haha I hope not! I’m usually laughing and making jokes. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:16:23
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:16:56
Honestly... I spent so much time collaborating and trying to connect with people through my Twitter account I'm kind of burned out, and just don't know what to do with it at the moment.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:40:26
Yeah it’s all vector. My computer would have exploded if I did this in photoshop. However the final piece I measured in inches. It was crashing my computer on Adobe illustrator consistently. Over 3000 layers. Don’t even want to guess how many paths. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:40:18
Yeah mate. I need to put more attention to my Instagram. I'm mostly on Twitter everyday and found a great supporting crypto crowd there. Definitely difficult to make this sustainable, and that's really tough for me at the moment.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:06:41
Ya thanks man. Exactly what he said. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:25:46
doggo is attak as i type this.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:30:53
Why not? Nobody else is doing this. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:29:23
I live in Dallas. I'll shoot you a DM.
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:31:50
Yeah budday!!!
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:12:51
Bitch don't put it on that level. It's just the current state of awkwardness relating to bringing it up with people that don't care. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:09:35
Ya I know it's not that big of a deal, just something most of us relate with if the topic ever comes up.
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:53:09
I agree there on the censorship, however a decentralized alternative will replace Twitter, and his influence will only help make it happen faster so it doesn't bother me.
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:09:35
Thanks mate. Took a really really long time, and just not sure how to raise awareness for it. Appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-02-02 20:04:00
LOL! You have absolutely no idea what everything means. Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:19:50
He's on the front bottom right!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:44:23
Thanks! He’s a good boi. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:55:13
That Chandler is such a slut!
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:30:16
Cool man! Will do!

Thanks a lot man. Appreciate it. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:37:29
We'll see about that in 10 years : )
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:21:07
Nailed it!
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:08:27
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:09:55
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:22:05
One doge = one doge. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:44:23
Ya man. You can find a pretty good picture on my slideshow of my website. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 05:01:19
Thanks dude. Honestly wish I could just have people see it in person. This technique basically turned it into an 80 inch tv. I’m so happy with the result. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:26:31
That’s funny you say that. If you look right in the middle of the piece, there is a guy with his arms in the air. I got Jazza to commission that nearly five years ago and he has a tutorial on it. I let him do one on the character. It’s one about mouth sync, and another about motion or something. “Tee shirt time” is the name of the tutorial. I literally learned so much from him. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:17:27
In a perfect world, but no idea what to do with this at the moment. Just a bit tired, and hopefully I'll get a breath of fresh air soon.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:31:05
Good doge. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:13:57
Yeah I agree there.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:10:28
Absolutely. That guys a stud, I’ll take it!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:42:55
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:51:57


Just checked it out. Looks like a cool subreddit!
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:12:07
It's so not though.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:24:30
He’s right behind Charle Lee(standing up)by the left side of the last supper. He’s kind of hidden but has a huge smile. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:33:44
Yes sir. I absolutely do. You can find different variations of the piece on my website. Www.krypticrooks.com the first slideshow link or the wall art collection link on home page. This one is absurdly expensive to make so that’s why the price is the way it is. I do offer more affordable pieces there and a promo poster. Check the pinned tweet on my twitter account  for a deep discount. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:24:01
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:30:38
Thanks man. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 13:20:26
Thanks man! Took forever to make. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:26:52
Gianni Secchi, and I'm mostly active on Twitter 
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:59:40
Well I just fed him green tea ice cream and some chicken pad thai for a once in a blue moon tonight!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:15:29
Ya I spent over 400 hours on this, and it’s insane expensive to produce using a new printing method called dye sublimation on aluminum metal. It’s almost a mirror high gloss. I understand it’s probably too pricey but don’t want to devalue it. I’ve got affordable versions printed on a cheaper material but the one for $5000 costs me $2000 to even get it to you. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:50:09
There’s a bull offering a peace pipe to a bear right in the middle and the bear is laughing in his face if that counts? Around the fire haha. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:28:38
I have not mate. Would love to have one up in London. 
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:05:10
Yes I did! There’s tons of moments in there from 2019. This is a compilation of 84 one panel comics I did on Twitter.
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:03:49
Ya it’s just a strange place. Now is such a great time to buy but nobody wants to listen. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:20:19
Thanks homie. 2018 sucked haha.
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:55:33
Not a bad approach!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:01:16
He’s there at the last supper on the way left of the table. There’s a litecoin logo on his chair.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:26:31
Wow such dog!
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:48:35
I’m based in Dallas but get these produced in California. It’s Freight shipping so that would be expensive for sure. Let’s link up in DMs and discuss more via email. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:42:34
Yes. Every character on there is an original comic from one of the 64 I did to raise awareness on my Twitter account  You can find a lot of the information out on my Instagram or Twitter if you care to look at it alongside the mural. I was planning on trying to sell them as digital collectibles if I could raise some awareness for this mural but I haven't been extremely successful there yet. Just getting some cashflow to figure out where to place this thing for awareness. It's just pretty tricky. Got to ask the world and see if I can get lucky somewhere.
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:08:32
Would be ideal. If you have a way to get it up there then I'm all for it.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:05:12
Crypto Twitter traders who post charts use monikers as avatars. I collaborated with all of them and made original comics for every character in here. Kanye West and Kim Kardashian using black bitcoin in Vegas last year. Everyone is associated with crypto but got to understand finding content every day to build a following alongside it during a terrible year was difficult. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:31:39
Haha that's actually a sleeve to use on your drawing tablet so your hand doesn't sweat on the monitor. Dogecoin is my dog. Name is Samus, and he's 6. Swear it's destiny I got him around the same time before doge blew up. Didn't know about doge when I got him.
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:48:39
He's on the phone right under the club coinbase sign to the way left in a Binance Hoodie.
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:41:37
lol. F off.
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:20:06
Haha in a perfect world. Just trying to figure out the right way to get this a bit of exposure right now, and I just don't know. Got to think about it some more.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:44:30
It’s kind of a portal into the other painting. Goes into the pitch I’m putting together. These pieces are connected!
@_date: 2019-02-01 02:22:17
Very Very accurate!
@_date: 2019-02-01 00:36:04
Thanks a lot man. Embarrassed to admit the hours put into there haha. Regardless, trying to build a name for myself in the bear market anyways.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:09:42
Haha yeah man. Just wanted to do some overboard to represent how tough the year was. 
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:50:03
Thanks man.
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:39:19
Yeah I need to!
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:49:13
No. I sacrificed two years of my life when I could have pursued other options to pay me and make me live a decent life to make these.
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:18:42
Haha thanks man.
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:39:46
Lol JP Morgan haha. Ya I’m finding some good options but trying to exhaust resources. Really tough raising awareness for this. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:29:07
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:23:19
Thanks man. Appreciate it. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:19:42
Ya I spent over 400 hours on this, and it’s insane expensive to produce using a new printing method called dye sublimation on aluminum metal. It’s almost a mirror high gloss printed in RGB. Typical printing is CMYK so that’s why the colors are so vivid. RGB is what our monitors use. I understand it’s probably too pricey but don’t want to devalue it. I’ve got affordable versions printed on a cheaper material but the one for $5000 costs me $2000 to even get it to you. I do wish I could provide it at a better cost but this literally consumed my entire year last year and thought I should only have limited editions of the colored version. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:47:57
Ya it’s too late. I am already making the 2019 mural which will be bigger and better. You can find all my comics I do  on Twitter. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:24:15
Doge is good.
@_date: 2019-12-16 16:26:14
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:06:28
Reckless abandon. Lol. This is just the size I chose to print. It’s vector. I can bring it down to whatever size.
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:13:13
Thanks mate. Means a lot. Spent a long time on these!
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:41:08
Thanks homie. Trying my hardest to justify the insane hours. 
I do sell these for a reasonable price. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 17:22:33
Ahhh man that would be a dream of mine. There’s a lot of action in this so I could totally see that happening. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:54:36
Thanks mate. Been depressing trying to get exposure for this. Not going to lie. Spent maybe 400 hours on it and can't figure out how the hell to get people to see it.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:27:09
Thanks man!
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:32:16
I’m ok with the troll.
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:21:43
He's the guy in the bottom right corner talking to Santa. Every character is actually a comic I post to Twitter. He's a Mall Manager.
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:45:42
Don’t look too deep into the syntax of the title. Would you rather me say nocoiner with an equally negative connotation? It’s just a way to identify those not involved. Just trying to raise awareness. 
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:16:24
Oh it’s there! Pretty easy to see in 2018 mural bottom right, and it’s crashed into the theater on the 2019 mural.
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:11:24
He is my dog afterall! Just happens to be associated with Crypto.
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:20:41
The limited edition large prints will only be 100. I have to offer affordable versions since the niche is so small. Having a hard time justifying even doing this. I don't think I can do another one next year if I don't sell any of these.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:26:21
Yeah man. Did work with him YEARS ago. Learned so much from him, and another guy David Park. Those guys are incredible. A few of Jazza's characters are on there.
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:18:38
China Fud was a little bit before 2018 if I’m not mistaken. 2017?
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:43:35
Shut up nerd. Lol.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:57:16
This is true. Thanks for the positive refreshing point of view.
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:47:40
You hate life. Your comment history says just that. Be more positive with life mate.
@_date: 2019-12-19 21:09:58
Sorry was a bit preoccupied when I was responding to you. I use mostly adobe animate and illustrator. The brushes are a pain in the ass on illustrator so use Animate and export as an SVG if you want it all in vector.
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:17:02
Thanks a lot mate. Just wish people would help support this more lol. I’m probably done with this after this mural.
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:16:07
Almost guarantee you that you’ve got more than 95% of the larpers out here on Reddit talking about crypto. Don’t shoot yourself short.
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:37:48
Wouldn't respond to my Twitter DMs haha.
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:53:44
Yes true about RE but diversification as well. I just love crypto and think it’s a once in a lifetime confident reason to own it at the moment. RE and Stocks can go up sure, but Crypto has the potential to do life altering things if adopted for not that much money now. This is what I’m getting at I guess. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:26:57
Right in the front!
@_date: 2019-12-24 13:18:13
Haha greatness. I’m in design myself so know how much work this is. Good stuff man.
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:30:06
Haha say hi to your cousin for me. Doge is a good boi when he wants to be. Super stubborn. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:29:36
Yes. I've got all different sorts of versions of it. I'm only making 100 prints of the massive mural. 
@_date: 2019-12-17 13:33:29
Thanks man. If only I could get people to care about these now lol.
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:17:23
Good eye!
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:48:06
Thanks man. These are crazy amounts of work.
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:01:37
No worries mate. I did 64 one panel comics that I post on social media to build awareness to this at the same time. This is a compilation of the 64 crypto comics made through out the year.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:12:22
Ya man. I do sell prints.  the top quality one is crazy expensive to produce with a style called dye sublimation on aluminum. It’s basically a mirror. I’ve got more affordable versions on the site, but I’ve got to brainstorm what exactly to do with this. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:08:20
Haha he’s got all the Monopoly money in front of him on the last supper scene. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 23:04:33
Bottom right homie. And a deloreon on the bottom left!
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:19:08
Thanks man. Just wish I could turn it into a worthwhile hobby!
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:49:37
Thanks brother!
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:35:51
Ya I wish I knew how to get it seen. Lol. Thanks for the encouragement.
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:29:57
I leik you : )
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:55:00
Yeah. That seems like a great way for people to understand it organically.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:25:31
Ya but if nobody is willing to pay for it, is it really worthwhile?
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:47:46
Yeah mate. I use mostly paint strokes which outline the strokes.
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:49:11
Haha thanks dude would be really cool and appreciate you supporting the work.
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:58:15
Yeah. I've definitely got the vector file, but wouldn't give that up. There are high res prints available at.
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:14:24
Thanks man! It’s a bit of an homage to us flirting in and out of $9k. Everyone keeps posting dbz stuff on Crypto Twitter when we’re around 9k
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:31:22
Would love that. About what I’ve valued the big piece at my website. Www.krypticrooks.net
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:50:45
Yeah, you can find them on my website. Offering good discounts as a bundle as well! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:01:47
Love it. I’m doing crypto art on a different approach. Animation. Www.thebitbandits.com so I appreciate the hard work this takes. Keep it up my friend. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:03:10
If you're interested, you can find it here. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:08:05
Yeah. I'm not terribly familiar with the area but if it's got foot traffic I'm down. What place exactly did you have in mind?
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:40:31
He's the toughest bastard I've ever met.  We joked about it, and he was like yeah I'll do it. The rest is history.
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:40:46
Not in this thread that's for sure!
