Do you have any statistics about that? Or do you think your sample size of a hand full of people says anthing about the whole picture?
Everyone I know, including my mum and my dad knows at least kilo, deci, centi and milli.
But if they just forgot and learned it once it would be really easy to refresh their memorys. It is a really logical and simple system that takes really no amount of effort to learn.
Bits is completely arbitrary and everyone would need to learn what 1 bit is in comparision to 1 btc and I don't think btc will go away.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:43:15
But they aren't with bits and BTC either. Or do you think BTC will go away?
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:57:07
Hmm ok sorry for not considering people who don't have the mental capacity to shift a decimal point 3 digits to the left or the right.
I think everyone who can spend money in a responsible way can educate himself about that. Maybe I am wrong and I just have extremely uncommon people around me who have I higher than average intelligence, but I don't beliefe that.
You also have to educate people about bits just the same way.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:16:37
I agree. I think people should use whatever slang term they can come up with for every amount of BTC.
But as a standard I don't think "bits" is the right way.
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:37:04
So I can own a whole Bitcoin. If you think that is too much worth. I would also be fine with using Satoshis, Gigasatoshis, Petasatoshis...
You are right there. Let's avoid a fiasco like miles, and feet and don't use bits.
Edit: But I give you a point there. If you are completely irrational and just like bits more. There is nothing I can say against that.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:56:50
But that would make Metric prefixes even more usefull. Because if that happens 100 satoshis are not 1 uBTS/bit anymore. And everyone here argues that one wants a unit which make bitcoin have 2 decimal places.
That would not be the case if you devide it up further than 8 decimal places.
Prefixes are then even more usefull because you can just go to nBTC.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:28:26
So your argument is basically we should never change anything because that is too difficult for most people to understand.
If most people think the inferior way is better we should just leave it like that.
Good that not everyone thinks like that.
I think it is just a matter of getting used to it for most people.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:22:29
Yeah it might be wiered at first. I still think it make the most sense. Of course if it is just a matter about what feels right or wrong I cannot argue with you, that is just a matter of opinion.
Many things that were nerdy once are now mainstream. Computers were very nerdy once. The Internet too. When you think about it tons of things were nerdy once.
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:07:12
So compatiblity to old cash registers?
Almost everything that can use bitcoin is a new development anyway and won't have such restriction.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:23:01
No currence so far can be really devided like BTC can be devided. You just cannot compare it with "normal" currencies.
If you compare it with other resources like metal, metric prefixes are used there.
So... you don't like it because it has something to do with science and logic?
So if I buy a kilogram of sugar in the supermarket I am nerdy?
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:47:56
I never called people stupid and would never do so.
I called the name "bits" stupid.
I can go and ask random persons on the street, or the janitor, or the mailman and they will all know what kilo, centi, milli and so on means.
And if there is really one who somehow doesn't, who somehow never bought some meat in a supermarket and wondered why it says gram or kilogram he sure as hell can learn that easily.
The only person trolling and calling people stupid is you. I just want a nice discussion because I like discussions.
@_date: 2014-10-28 10:55:17
Why switch again? 
We never switched anywhere... we just use the standard SI prefixes. They are used everywhere in the world for pretty much everything. You use them if you say Megabyte or Gigabyte propably every day.
You know these ones:
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:49:01
I don't see the reason why it has to print it in the base unit. Is that some kind of law or something in the US?
It could just print it with the prefix that's most convenient or has as little zeros in front as possible.
Also I don't see a reason why you couldn't print it in the base unit apart from it looking kinda wiered.
I am also for doing the right thing. I am just not convinced that "bits" is the right thing. Especially because we have no idea how the value of Bitcoin develops in the future.
@_date: 2014-06-26 08:50:31
Almost the whole world uses the SI system for pretty much every unit of measurement. It makes al lot of sense to use it for currency too.
Bit is already a widely used term and discribes something completely different ( we could just as well use flops, volt, gram - it is stupid to use the same name for different things).
So I disagree if you really want to have huge numbers - and I don't see why you would want that - use µBTC or nBTC or something even smaller.
SI system makes sense - BIT makes no sense.
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:22:11
Well and when buying stuff in every supermarket of course or in general everywhere all the time when buying almost anything.
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:33:16
I answered that already in a few other comments.
Show me a country where you can even devide a cuccency like you can with Bitcoin, then I show you a country where they use it like that.
There just wasn't any currency like this before so you cannot compare it to currencies which can only be devided up to 2 decimal places.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:34:12
Yeah maybe in the USA. But not so in almost every other country. We use it every day.
And you too, just think of Megabyte and Gigabyte.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:31:59
Well we just use uBTC then. That is the beauty of using prefixes, they are very flexible.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:59:19
You are right. That is why I argue with people here (also it is fun).
Sure, if everyone decides that "bits" is the better way it will happen whether the other side wants it or not.
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:14:10
Yes, I completely agree.
The metric system is an international standart used in every country of the world but the US, Myanmar(formerly Burma) and Liberia.
So it makes sense for a currency which is used worldwide to use that already established and proven system of measurement.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:40:47
But that is my point. People are already familiar with the metric system. They use it when they buy meat or vegetable or whatever (again apart from the US, Myanmar and Liberia).
They know about bitcoins. But they don't know about some arbitrary term like "bits"
@_date: 2014-10-28 10:52:35
Everyone learns SI prefixes in school in every first world country... propably every country which has schools and uses the metric system. So pretty much everywhere that matters.
And those that don't know what giga, mega, kilo, milli, micro etc. means are better of learning that anyway.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:50:23
I will just leave that here:
It is basically just the USA
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:20:32
Well, thanks for answering and not just downvoting.
You are right of course, there are a ton of words which have multiple meanings. So it might not be a good argument against "bits".
All theses things you can still do with metric-prefixes. It is not an Argument against them. Espescially since bits is just another name for uBTC.
What emotional value does "bits" have that makes it better? 
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:38:43
I really should read everything trice before answering here on reddit.
So where are we getting?
I said there cannot be an established name for 0.25cents because it isn't used anywhere.
For now I just see bits as another term for uBTC. I just don't see what makes bits easier to use that uBTC. I am even fine if people use bits as slang, but as default and on invoices etc. it should say uBTC.
And should the value of bitcoin fall further we have 10000bits for a coffee some day and then it is just the same problem over again.
@_date: 2014-10-28 10:44:35
I will never ever understand why anyone could possibly like "bits" more than "MBTC, kBTC, BTC, mBTC, uBTC, nBTC". I thought SI prefixes were the best thing ever and one of the things I really liked about Bitcoins.
It just makes sense, is logical and fits the current measurement system of almost every country in the world.
Why would anyone want to change that into something, stupid and as illogical as "bits"?
I mean sure people who use stuff like °F, miles and inches might want to do so, but it really makes no sense at all.
Edit: And for the people downvoting me. Sorry for insulting your holy imperial system. But look at a map of the places it is still used. We want Bitcoin to be something that's used everywhere in the world and not just the USA. And Metric prefixes are far more aproachable than an arbitrary system.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:10:14
I agree. You need to think a minute or so about that.
But tell me one everyday case that might happen if bitcoin is used everywhere where someone would need to do that in his head.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:03:33
You think 0.25$ = 25 millidollars? Are you serious?
I also really don't know why you need to swear in a normal discussion.
I abbreviate k€ when I write. Apart from that just because we don't do it now does not make wrong.
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:25:42
No, since 2009 the IEEE, EU, ISO and NIST have agreed upon that it is exactly 1000 kilobytes and 1000 megabytes.
As defined in 1998 by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:53:38
Imho user interface design is a part of computer science.
Yeah lets just call it uBTC. If people really want to they can use "bits" as slang.
But if that's really too confusing for people you are right that mBTC would be bad for mainstream adoption. I just don't think it is.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:19:05
Oh sorry, my bad. I really over looked that. 0.25 cents never comes up for normal people.
Maybe in financial computer systems or something and than it wouldn't matter anyway how you call it.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:19:32
But by using prefixes you effectively move the decimal point.
Or what do you mean by moving the decimal point? So you would declare that from now on 1 BTC = 1mBTC... but then you could just call ist mBTC from that point on and everything would stay the same.
Also no matter how you call it, moving the decimal point would be confusing with every naming scheme.
We already have main unit, it is called BTC (or XBT). If the value falls we will use kBTC, if it rises we use uBTC.
Metric- prefixes address everyone of you arguments too and are far far more flexible and less confusing.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:30:10
Well you may feels so now. But that's just because you are not used to it.
And I am sorry to break it to you but right now using bitcoin is nerdy.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:37:19
I can do so when I am home from work. But she will propably be quite ok with it. I don't live in the USA. We have the metric system here... like in 95% of the world.
Edit: Called my mum for fun and giggles. She said one needs propably time to get used to it but she would not be confused or anything and she wouldn't have a problem with it. In this case with milli€

QR codes are awesome in terms of error correction. Someone tried in this blog post what you can do to one before it becomes unreadable.
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:10:10
Yeah I understood. I just wanted to make another argument. After all I hope I convince at least someone that metric is better.
Maybe somebody reads that :)
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:27:01
So can somebody explain to me why "bits" is better than Metric prefixes?
Apart from "I like how it sounds" or "There is no microDollar".
Bitcoins is completely different from other currcencies so you cannot compare it to dollar or euro.
There just is no 1.23442234$. 
We have the possibilty to do something better than other currencies.
So why "bits"?
There are a few good arguments for the Metric-prefixes e.g. they are already used everywhere in the world and the majority of people know them already.
We don't have to switch around if the value of BTC rises or falls, we just use a different prefix.
There are also a few arguments agains "bits". "Bits" is already used to define something else. "Bits" is the smallest possible amount in computer science and thus confusing because it is used differently here.
I have yet to read a good argument for "bits" apart from "it sounds better".
Or is that really all there is to it? How it sounds?
