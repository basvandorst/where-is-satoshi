you have no idea how bitcoin works, do you? you don't need to download the blockchain to have a wallet. please learn about paper wallets (for example) or any other form of wallets where YOU control the private key and not some !centralized! company.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:34:44
exactly my point
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:30:01
please don't view me as a troll but use your brains for 5 seconds. why is everybody trusting online wallets and exchanges to store your assets in? did everyone forget what bitcoin strength is? DECENTRALIZATION... so why are you guys putting your btc in centralized institutions? I'm not a pro by a long shot, but i don't hold large amounts with any exchange. did none of you learn anything from MtGox?
this is exactly why i posted this thank you. because so many people always make the same mistake, even when you yourself can prevent this from happening. Again. i'm not a pro and i certainly don't have all the answers. just use your brains a bit. that's all i'm saying

My fav moment is when a second BTC ATM was installed in my city closer to my home (Ghent, Belgium)
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:54:34
i just wanna see proof of the hack
@_date: 2015-06-25 01:19:10
well. i'm starting to lose my faith now. earlier they said they found "and i quote: We have found the entry point and we're ready to move on". What where they ready to move on for, to sell us some more BS? If they said they found the "entry point", did they leave it wide open and added some flashy neon lights above it or what? I wonder what the next excuse is going to be. Look. I'm giving him till the 30th as he claims here. even if i nly had 30 cents words of hashing power running there, i'm sure other people got screwed over for a lot more. I hope it doesn't have to come to people tracking the guy down and bring him to justice... i really hope not.

ok, been prompted to change my pin, username and password. Lets see what happens next...
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:01:00
they updated there message when logging in:
Update: Aside from the stolen coins, there's no other damage done. We have found the entry point and we're ready to move on. We're in the progress of installing a new server and should be back in business within a week.
There's a lot of speculation regarding KHS/BTC balances, all balances will be rolled back to the last backup before the lock down.
You will be forced to change your emails, password and PIN upon your first login. (These are hashed but it's good practice to reset after a breach like this).
It was a big blow, but we'll come out stronger then ever. We appreciate the patience and all of the kind words we have received. I'll update as we make progress.
@_date: 2015-06-28 03:57:43
yeah, looks like they are back.... got my KHS back, so yay? we'll see i guess
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:33:33
OK, let think for a sec here. They got hacked they claim... Can happen, but i wonder why all KHS is set to zero as well. they (cleverly) explain that the hacker also did that... of course he did -.- So then, they say that they still have backups, so that means they know how much KHS every single user has. well then i expect them to put that back.
But i'd like to see some proof of the so called hack tho. it the BTW got stolen then i'd like to see that on the blockchain. so scrypt.cc people, post that if you will.
@_date: 2015-06-23 01:48:34
I agree that it is too soon to label them as "non-paying". I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. We'll see in a week. They said they will be back online and users would get there balances back. So yeah, hold down on blacklisting them just yet i'd say.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:16:33
looks like this guy likes to yell. he has more video's where he blames sites of being scams. As i said earlier, i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. I want to see what happens next week. AND i'm still waiting on proof they actually got hacked.

I thought IE was a tool to install Chrome or Firefox, etc.. You're telling me its an actual browser!? My mind has been blown!
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:37:37
Then what should we do eh?
@_date: 2014-07-05 06:16:28
I think allot of people feel this way. I heard about bitcoin about a year ago, not really knowing what it was and therefore mostly ignoring it. Then for some reason i got reading about it and was absolutely amazed, shocked, happy and kinda depressed all in the same time. i was amazed at the idea after reading Satoshi Nakamoto's paper and seeing the result and then really sad that i ignored it for so long. I am now running my small mining operation and invest in bitcoin. I made money so far and truly believe bitcoin is here to stay and will be a part of our daily lives just like the internet and the smartphone became to be.
@_date: 2014-07-05 06:44:49
I'm mining at CEX.IO for some time now and i'm looking for alternatives. I may give this one a shot. Thanks for this info
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:10:01
with a pair of giant binoculars perhaps?
@_date: 2014-07-05 06:56:42
They should know whats going on in my opinion, but i can see your point.
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:34:03
Wow, i don't live in US and didn't really see these kind of fee's. that's theft...

@_date: 2017-11-01 23:59:25
Rebooted one of my (7) full nodes (all on different addresses) just to see what one of them does in a day. I rebooted it 6 hours ago and it's now at 6GB.
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:14:27
Step 5: look at the bigger picture
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:47:29
ok, they are back.... kinda... so far no mining, only trading and no word of the admins so far. the site goes offline every now and then (server busy message)
sadly the chatbox is full of trolls so no good info there.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:00:45
Well, that was just an hour long advert for bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:34:33
i kinda have to agree with you on that
@_date: 2015-07-02 12:19:07
So, the mining is still not up after 24 hours after they said it should. you can't get a hold of any admin or mod. all you can do is watch a chatbox full of trolls but when i try to post in it it doesn't post my message. After looking around a bit it looks like many people can't post in that chatbox.
Also looking into the history of scrypt.cc its becoming clear the admin is doing yet an other disappearing trick on us. luckily i'm only into them for about 20 cents.
So i'd say leave scrypt.cc alone. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:31:51
yes, this is what i found out as well. As but i'm still very skeptical. I'm not going to deposit just yet. i'll just let my 247 KHS i have there run and see what happens.
@_date: 2015-08-08 19:31:58
@_date: 2015-07-18 22:13:23
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:36:58
For what it's worth, i'm running 7 full nodes for a couple of years now and keeping them as up to date as possible.
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:02:26
Yeah, it does indeed feel good.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:34:41
Not if they are on different locations. I should have clarified that, sorry.
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:11:03
as expected....
@_date: 2016-05-28 04:34:48
yay :) 
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:55:22
where did you get that from? this is a sketch from a Belgian TV show called 'In de Gloria". The sketch itself is called 'Boomerang' and here is the true original: 
This TV show aired in 2007. read here:  And use Google Translate, because its Dutch.
where do you get your facts from dude? how can you say he actually got fired when its completely staged? The TV show 'In de Gloria' was nothing but sketches like these... Geez dude...
