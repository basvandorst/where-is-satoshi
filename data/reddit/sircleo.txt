So you just want to put a bunch of existing BTC ATMs in a room?

This is for the mobile version which I see you've integrated. On the home page clicking on the link "More Categories" takes you to a page with all the items available in the store. There is a design flaw here. One item picture takes up an entire screen on my iPhone 6. It's certainly inefficient in that there's too much scrolling involved. Needs less spacing and resizing. And perhaps more items per row. I don't know if you consider the mobile version a top priority but here you go. I'll let you know if I find some more.

Am I too late to the party?

I think you have to specify the currency. 1.9085 dollars, bitcoins, or bits, whichever it is.

not always, but most of the time. In gambling, the only way to win is be lucky and cash out quick. Or develop an advantage play somehow.

Second feedback: During registration, should include a function to check the First name and Last name strings to be only letters. It is currently allowing non-alphabet characters such as punctuations. 
Adding on to that, ask for user to type password twice as it is standard. Also add a function to check that the two are equal.
And as always, the confirmation email should contain a link that verifies the email as truly the users, before allowing user to log-in. It's standard and benefits both parties.

I totally skipped right over that sentence.

That's fucking insane that this guys going to prison over Bitcoin. Kudos to him for keeping his head up. Although I think MAK would simply not work because of corruption within and the discrepancies created by inmates fixing the books. Everyone's notebooks would all start looking different.
