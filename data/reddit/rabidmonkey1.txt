Actually, the launch of Doge was exceptional, and the software landscape is growing each day. For instance, there's a dogecoin multibit wallet called multidoge. No other alt, as far as I know, has their own multibit wallet. Add that to things like Facebook and Youtube tipping, and this thing is spreading fast.
And unlimited/inflationary is missing the point. If you review the numbers, it is a very, very, very small number of coins added to the network over some ridiculous time frame like a century and a half or so. Its one solution for dealing with things like lost coins and such, and not a constant 5% inflation rate like some (Ars technica) misunderstood. See:

I understand the sentiment. However, in my mind, resorting to government is an admission that society can't freely organize itself in a way that's beneficial for all, and that we must introduce coercion at some level to modify individual behavior. And that's ultimately circular reasoning: we can't trust people, so let's have a government made up of people.

It's not voluntary collective "pooling." It's a group of armed individuals threatening the masses with audits/raids/jail time if they don't pay up. It's the very definition of violent and coercive.
The method of collection itself is immoral because it utilizes coercion/violence!
The voluntary pooling of resources is and has always been allowed. You can walk down to your state capital right now and hand them a check. Literally everyone can do the same.
But you don't. Instead, you advocate for a violent monopoly coming to raid everyone's coffers for the "collective good" - a phrase so deliberately vague that it could really justify anything!
Hiding behind notions of democracy is pathetic. Democracy is just an organized mob; the tyranny of the majority.
And really, you can't logically demonstrate why the state owning 100% of a person's labor (slavery) is somehow morally better than the state owning 30% of a person's labor. 
I mean, really, taxes are higher than 30% anyway when you total them all up. For many, it's 50%.
So, when you look at it that way, literally HALF of all the work you do belongs to the state. How do you justify this 50% slavery?

Volume is tapering off right now as prices remain high. I don't expect it to go much higher in the next 24 hours. You'll probably see a cap around 130.
We were at 94 yesterday, and 30 point gains are the stuff bubbles are made of, but I wouldn't call this a bubble yet. If you plot this on a long-term chart, you'd be justified in seeing it as a return to normal right now. However, if it continues to climb at this rate, then yeah... we're headed for bubble territory again.
I think it's reasonable to see a $400-$800 coin at the end of the year. However... That needs to happen slowly over the next eight months, as the economy and infrastructure and demand grows.

There might be a few, high profile guys they might be able to nab, and in return get a few hefty payouts from them, but if bitcoins goes widespread, it's going to take a lot of effort for chump change.
In other words, because they can't automate it, and because there are only so many large targets in the world, and because the amount of effort and resources required to tie someone to a wallet doesn't change, it simply won't be worth it to nab everyone (if anyone at all).

Alt coins seem to catch a lot of flack on this sub, but I don't understand why. A competitive marketplace is a fundamentally good thing, and open-source software naturally leads to more innovation. To think that someone wouldn't build on Bitcoin's software is idiocy, as is the idea that there should only be one, monolithic currency.
In the immediate future: 
1. LTC is most likely going to be added to MtGox very soon, and 
2. BitPay is integrating it into their payment system. 
3. LTC has recently jumped from around 10-20 cents, to around $4.00 today. 
4. They also recently passed the million dollar market cap, and there is a LTC Silk Road known as Atlantis.
It also has a few advantages over Bitcoin. 
1. There will be more coins. 84 million to be precise. This might make it a more commonly used currency, but this is speculation on my part.
2. The encryption in LTC theoretically eliminates the advantages ASICS bring to those privileged enough to be able to afford one. 
3. The network is a bit faster than BTC, with confirms coming in fairly quickly. 
Now, these might not be the biggest advantages in the world, but they exist and are worth noting. We shouldn't pretend that BTC doesn't have issues; it does. Innovation can and will still occur in the cryptocoin world.
**But this next point is the one that I think is the most important...**
LTC doesn't have to do the heavy lifting BTC did, because BTC was the trailblazer. Think about all the infrastructure that exists because of BTC. Exchanges, forums, heck, even the concept of Cryptocurrencies in general... BTC had to (and to an extent still has to) overcome all these. All that basically took three years.
Now, because all that is out of the way, LTC has a serious advantage over BTC. Why wouldn't a retailer simply add LTC to their stores? Why wouldn't exchanges want the extra business? It just makes sense for everyone to accommodate it, and it's so easy to implement if you're already accepting BTC.
Personally, I think you'll see a $10 LTC very soon, but the proper value should be somewhere around $30-50 in the long-term. 
Third place will probably be PPCoin, but it's got a way to go.
There is room in the market for all these and more. The more choice, the better.

What utter, unfounded assertions.
The crux of this guy's argument is that u/Bitcoinbillionaire is a sock puppet for elite bankers in order to dump currency onto the market as part 1(!) in their devious scheme to test the resiliency of the currency.
Look, I don't doubt that central bankers would ultimately loathe the idea of a limited-supply cryptocurrency and will at some point attack it. But I seriously doubt that a reddit user giving out little more than 10K USD is the spear point for some nefarious digital attack plan. I don't think it's rational to make the leap this guy is making here. It just creates more FUD.
Look, we know what happened in the crash:
1) MtGox experienced a huge amount of volume and their servers couldn't take it. This lead to:
2) an incredible amount of lag which caused people to:
3) panic and sell, sell, sell. At which point, a:
4) DDOS of Bitcoin related sites didn't help matters, in conjunction with:
5) Market manipulation wherein spammers repeatedly put in orders for lower and lower prices in incredibly small units, driving the price down further and creating a feedback loop of panic and fear.
6) It didn't help that MtGox didn't communicate during this time.
Truth be told, these are really stupid reasons for a crash to happen. Nothing changed in the currency. Bitcoin is still a revolutionary technology. Right now, it seems to be rising again in value because there is serious demand for them. The weak hands panicked and lost, and now the market will consolidate. Expect this trend to continue for the next 3-5 years. There will continue to be major ups and downs until worldwide adoption occurs and things ultimately stabilize, but we are still in (believe it or not) the early adoption phase of the currency.

It's a case of diminishing returns with something like that, though. Think of all the effort, manpower, and money needed to set up some kind of operation like that, as well as the legal challenges that would come up in the face of it - such as positively ID'ing someone and tying them to a wallet address.
No, they're better off just setting up some kind of consumption tax and calling it a day, and they will figure that out. Besides, at BTC's current market cap, it's just a blip on their radar. They have trillions upon trillions in fiat to worry about.

You accept it only when tickets are available, and that's only ever explained, of all places, in the trollbox on your site.
On top of that, there's no way to actually tell if tickets are available unless you're visiting the site every day, multiple times a day, specifically to check if the tickets are there.
If your solution is to go from Dwolla-&gt;MtGox-&gt;BTC-E, I'm sorry... that's really bad. You're asking people to sign up for three different sites, await verification at all of them, and basically wait a week each time they want to transfer money, by which time who knows where they market will be.

Because BTC was built explicitly so that no central authority could control it in any way. It's a cryptocurrency, built by a crypto-anarchist, and the anarchist part can't be understated. Anarchists believe that the state is illegitimate because it is fundamentally immoral; that is, all actions it takes are predicated on the use of force/coercion/violence. Under this view, taxation is theft; otherwise, any group of robbers could declare themselves a government and establish a tax. There's a good reason Bastiat called taxation "legal plunder."
But then we get people like you in here who come in and say, "Hurr durr, tax good cause tax build road and buy battleship." You haven't actually sat down and said, "Gee, is there any way that in a free society, people can voluntarily come together and build roads without having to resort to force and violence?" Instead, you take the lazy path and simply lie down and praise these ancient, violent, inefficient bureaucracies like they're a good thing. 
No, we don't want to be systematically robbed just because you and people like you think it's a good thing. In fact, I'd rather you not use the currency at all, if you're going to advocate plundering everyone else's wallets. Keep your fiat. Keep suckling from the teet of the state, like a good, dependent farm animal. 
Thank God the men whole built the BTC network are smarter than the fools who would try to control it. Pass all the legislation you want. You won't be able to control it, tax it, or regulate it.

Basically, your argument is: People are **so** bad and **so** immoral that they wouldn't help me in the ways I want, when I want it, so naturally, I need to use the apparatus of the state (force) to rob them of their money and use it as I deem fit.
Don't you see the circularity of this argument? People are inherently bad; therefore we need a government of people.
Also, what gives you the right to determine how these funds are spent? Why not, oh, I don't know, corporate fat-cats with ties to the military industrial complex? They can shout just as loud as you, you know (and it also helps that they have a lot more lobbying money).
Truthfully, I wouldn't have trapped you in a system that required you to pay exorbitant fees for surgery, or education to begin with. The government has drastically distorted the marketplace in both Education and Medicine and continues to do so, which has the effect of keeping the poor, poor, and thus, bound to the state for fear of life. Which is fine for the politician's re-election.


So basically, it's wonderful when someone wants to give you a free and open system, but equally wonderful when you advocate centralizing and controlling it? And you want equal respect when you advocate this system of robbery?

Not if you consider the challenge of identifying the owners of each and every wallet.
If BTC ever gets big enough that the state starts taking an interest in it, you'll see people doing business is uBTC and smaller decimals. You're talking about tracking trillions of bits. 
Now, that may be "easy" enough with regulating exchanges, but clean coins - those that are mined - are another matter entirely. There may come a day when clean coins are more valuable than regular coins.
Anyway, I imagine this would go a lot like copyright infringement cases, where an IP address isn't enough to link a user to their funds, so now you've wasted IRS manpower, but also judicial hours in trying to convict people of... what, exactly? Being wealthy?
