I'll take two bitcoins!

But one day all the world will use bitcoin! You just have to invest now and believe!

Ehh... eventually humanity will reach a state of pure energy. Just like Bitcoin reaching its own goal both will take many years to happen, if they happen.

This is the correct response.

Banks also allow for safe deposit boxes and loans for various investments like homes and businesses.

Unless you can spend over $6k USD to buy some insane hardware you will not be having any chance of mining a coin. The difficulty is insane and going higher each month. Even investing a large amount does not guarantee returns as other will outspend you more often if you do not have a stable monthly income of a few thousand to buy more equipment.
Pick a new hobby or trade bitcoins but do not mine them.

And here I am watching bitcoins fall with the Ruble...

Removal of Bitcoin donation link in 2 months. Has happened to many donating sites which have a burst in the first few days to none after a month of service. It's sad that some of us can't be generous like Dogecoiners.
Gave 0.05 bits.

Why haven't you mined?

Remember the days when it was over $1k? I'm still waiting for it to bounce back up to its high.

I would be even better if the merchants who accepted it did not sell it right as they got paid...

Yep. They hit 48% at one point. It seems that by dropping their block size to less than half a MB they are able to process their "found" bitcoin faster than the rest of the pools. Unless other pools drop their block sizes this is going to be a clusterfuck.

Or taking the log rate of inflation per GDP.

Creepy if done without their permission.

Please do not do this unless you are sure you will not be fired for "being an idiot".
It has happened before.

It is worse today. All those Ghashes running non stop at various levels of efficiency due to various miners puts it at a ridiculous level of using electricity.
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:20:40
So it does not take the actual coin but only our business through bitpay.

Because the new car will be used by everyone in a decade and people who invest now will have it worth a thousand fold more by then!

Your sadness makes me hard.

I have a cheap phone used with the most basic plan to talk with family or do business. SMS cost is 0.25 per send or receive while talking is 0.5 per minute. I do not need much more as I will meet up with people face to face for longer conversations and using bitcoin would ruin my phone budget.

Thanks. Very informative!

You guys were never hacked. This is just you trying to save face after the FUD you were spreading about Paycoin blew up in your face.
