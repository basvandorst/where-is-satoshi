Because of Bitcoins radical disruption capabilities, it's powerful enemies should be expected to use every possible avenue in orchestra including all of the above and more.
Bitcoin is built to be resilient against such attacks; it will be tested heavily.

I think these are the tactics of  scared bankers, not revolutionary cryptofanatics. The Ethereum spam is another part of the multifaceted R3 attack
Edit: or, to be fair, a byproduct of it.

Ding ding ding, we have a winner, folks!
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:29:17
Spot on

And most of them agree on how to scale bitcoin. Yet the outliers dominate the conversation. We should all be critical of this situation.
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:30:42
Yes indeed.

Yes as bitcoin core is the organically grown open source client responsible for bootstrapping and creating the bitcoin network. Bitcoin unlimited is an amateur closed source hack job of core code. It's almost like the huge team of bitcoin contributors agree that the network is worth defending from hostile parties like they have been for almost 10 years!

Hell no we don't! It warms my heart to see bitcoin able to resist the political attacks levied at it so far. We will continue as normal

He's technically correct. Majority support of BU could just as likely reduce the block size thanks to the magic of "emergent consensus"
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:00:56
So are you saying that sinister motives can never provide a benefit for the actor?
@_date: 2016-01-09 09:23:27
that's very insightful...great comment killerstorm

Truly one of bitcoins greatest minds. RIP Hal thank you for everything you did for us.
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:38:31
Except he's right? What are you on about?
 Segwit definitively raises the size of blocks from the technical consensus at 1mb, BU removes completely the network's technical consensus (ie, miners set custom individual consensus parameters [which is an oxymoron])
I'm thinking you're the one uninformed?
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:44:43
No matter how many times you repeat blocksize increasing hard fork it will not come true. There are a great many of us who oppose a hard fork at all. Why is your crowd so twisted up about hard forks again? Or is that a secret? (;

I've been struggling to understand mining centralization recently. I don't agree that 8 entities control half the network. If those 'entities' work together towards an attack with 51% hashing power, individual miners from each pool will make changes to correct the imbalance.

The opposition have stepped their game up. They will continue to win sympathy from those they manage to mislead. To those of us who know why we are here...

BEAUTIFUL! Way to lay it down like it is, I'm really happy about this post! You guys at bitfury just earned my resepect!
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:58:12
This is why I believe this attack is being levied right now ahead of that wall. They realize that time is ticking and that bitcoin decentralization is going to explode after we see affordable consumer 14nm chips

Nicely put greg,  I enjoy your analyses when you take the time to write here!
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:07:24
