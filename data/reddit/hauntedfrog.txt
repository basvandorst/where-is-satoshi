As a Canadian, I didn't notice how weird that was until I travelled for the first time and couldn't figure out what to call other countries' coins.

Thought this post was on r/wow for a second.

The problem there is that you're conflating dressing a certain way with being an easier target. The clothes you wear don't make you any easier or harder to assault. It also doesn't make you a more *valuable* target, like announcing that you have thousands of dollars in your wallet.
No, the issue is that people have decided that certain clothes mean that she probably wants it. Or if she doesn't, well, she shouldn't have dressed like that because that's the message she was sending. That's bullshit. It assumes that men are feral and see something pretty and lose their minds. And it assumes that a person's clothing choice is about communicating with *you*, when it has nothing to do with you at all. 
You summed it up right here:




That's where you've conflated being in a risky situation with dressing a certain way as both making you an easier target. Being alone in a sketchy neighbourhood is not wise because it *does* make you an easier target, whether you're a man or woman. But dressing a certain way doesn't have any bearing on that unless your assaulter decides that because you're dressing that way, you deserve to be a target. And *that's* the problem that needs to be fixed.

Have you ever stepped outside the USA? Because your Democrats are so far from communism that the comparison is laughable.
Seriously. The rest of the developed world has way more social programs than you do and even we're not close to socialism.

Yes. If I wear a sports jersey for the "wrong" team in a city and get beaten up at a bar for it, I have every right to complain that I was assaulted for wanting to dress that way.
If a woman wears clothes that she likes and that make her feel attractive, she still has every right to complain if someone assumes that gives them the right to verbally of physically abuse her.
Your statement suggests that you think that women who dress "as sluts" deserve to be treated badly and taught a lesson so they don't dress that way. Why? What's _wrong_ with dressing that way? Why should that give people the idea that they are _allowed_ to mistreat someone dressed in less conservative clothing?

I never knew how much I needed the word "cryptomuggle" in my vocabulary.

Again, that's not the same. Broadcasting your wealth makes you a more valuable target. Given the choice between someone with expensive jewelry and someone without, the person with expensive jewelry is the better robbery target because they payoff is greater for the same amount of effort.
Clothing doesn't "increase the value" nor "decrease the effort". It's entirely perception-based, because other people think that somehow your clothing makes you the more _deserving_ target.

You don't think Bitcoins are pretty?
Mmmm, text strings...
