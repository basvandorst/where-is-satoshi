Some one thought it was tldr and instead jumped to conclusions and proceeded to comment.

They may or may not be manipulating "everything". But im damn sure many people think they are. Hence self fulfilling prophecy.

Hmmm you got me thinking. I have been thinking to same thing for some time now. I think whatever coin "they" push for wide scale adoption will have a few main differences to bitcoin.
1) It will NOT be immutable (they will be able to reverse "lost" transactions. For an example if a payment is sent to wrong address it can be reversed and this will be the pre-text to be allow some payments to be censored on the network.
2) It will be inflationary (no hard cap on maximum produce-able coins) and they will be able to set the level of inflation as they do now with fiat. This will encourage spending rather than hoarding/hodling.
3) Mining will be more energy efficient.

Here is my take on the "to hodl or to spend" dilemma... 
1) Deposit earnings/wage to Bitcoin.. 
2) Spend some to live.. 
3) Hodl and save some for the MOON.
This way you learn to save and you "un-become" a soulless impulsive consumer.

Last time i checked the USD was not a payment system/network. You still have to use banks to send USDs and banks are closed on weekends (and they also close by 5pm on the days they are actually open).

Im sure your bank charges you (for international wires, expedited payments, etc) like EVERY other retail bank charges their customer. Heres the key word -&gt; "retail".
Which means they are in it to make money. But noooo, your bank is different, it's a charitable organization that handles EVERY single transaction for free and gives it's customers smiley faced stickers everytime they make a deposit. LOL

You do know you can send someone Bitcoin directly right? You DON'T need an exchange or any third party to send someone Bitcoin. Hence the "Peer 2 Peer" part.
And btw in no shape or form am I bashing the dollar or any other fiat currency. I'm just saying Bitcoin is rather appealing in our fast paced,  internet enabled society. The dollar is great, Bitcoin is different. That's all.

So how do you pay someone who lives on the other side of the planet with "the dollars you have in your pocket"?
I know! Use a bank or an exchange or a third party who is open at specific hours on specific days. Or you can always go on horse back and physically pay the person, in person. Just like the good ol' days :)

2017 is definetly Bitcoins year.

Hmmm, and in your alternate universe, the banks don't charge processing fee's. Am i right?
PS: I did not say Bitcoin was offering a free lunch on every level. You have to pay to play. But im sure everyone would agree the fees are negligible in comparison to the immutable, censorship resistant service the Bitcoin network provides for its users.
