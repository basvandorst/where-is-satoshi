Crazy mofo. I'll take 500k or so worth of BTC and spend it on expensive things.

UPDATED** (via reply, not edit so you can see i've been reading)
* OK, so reading the ToS, i see you have a limit for exchanges, very nice. won't trigger holds. still 20+ small or large deposits will trigger an audit if made within a short period of time. 
Some negatives:
* Site page for sellers was not nice. the text entry boxes gave me the impression there were text in place and i had to erase (which obviously nothing happened). I tried a few browsers on OSX, I'll give my Windows browser a go to get the feel for it. **edit** page looks the same on Windows too. 
* I may not be all the way in the site so I may be missing it, but i'd like to add multiple banks to open up my customer options. Who has just 1 bank anymore? :)
* I see you support Altcoins, please add DarkCoin 
(*edit for format and screen shot for site)

site is pretty self explanatory, find a bank near you, find someone on that site selling coins using that bank, select how much you want, deposit cash to the bank in the account and ~3 hours later you've got your coins.  Then use gyft to buy something useful. 
Sadly you might lose a bit on the fees here and there, but for a quick how-to, it's great.
Here's $1 to get you on your way. @_date: 2015-03-13 21:53:27

Same thing here, then they replied that my account is closed due to bank freezes. which I never understood because they withdrew $1.47 but never made a deposit.  
I'm back to coinbase anyway and I'm trying the one listed in the thread below that has no transaction fees for beta testers, forever.

1. Never heard of you, sorry :/ nice idea though
2. In person isn't required and thats what stopped me from doing Localcoins.   
3. Bank tracking, so large deposits will be flagged and that means taxes...
I'm willing to give it a go, i'm reading over the site now.
