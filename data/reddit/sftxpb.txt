* Limited supply? No, some one can produce it on demand
* Truly decentralised? Yes, present in infinite amount for everyone
* Volatile? Yes, especially in presence of crush or friends, value can skyrocket
* Liquid? Yes, you can share this special power with anyone!
Please invest in it! Infinite, stable, timeless, volatile but riskless.
Note: US marketcap already skyrocketing

Hello Bill, is there a coin associated with it? I'm buying the altcoins with my stock to constitute a people's choice charity fund.

Although I appreciate the content of your comment, I think its formulation is rude.
Anyhow, I think the CEO's of these bank
A) have a certain level of acquaintace (sharing board positions for example).
B) Could definitely coordinate a short.
Have a great day!

Ladies and gentlemen, the way a gentlemen shorts bitcoins (Bitcoin is a fraud), then pumps it (Morgan Stanley position on exchange). The dump is coming soon

Anyhow, this is the dip you were looking for! Thanks Grandson!
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:59:55
Although I agree it does not look good. But this is the dip you were looking for!

Just split your investment and breathe. Half Bitcoin, half whatever pleases you and look at the value of your investment in bitcoin increase. When bitcoin's value drops, a lot of other coin delay their drop and even do better. Which means that if you monitor well enough, you can double your amount of bitcoins in that kind of situation.
Keep calm and HODL

I bet steam regrets not taking bitcoins anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:32
Yup, done too. Just dropped all my coins elsewhere. God this is an annoying platform...
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:52:06
Prepare to buy the next dip. No panic, just chip in next time it dips.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:25:00
Just bought the dip AND bought the hike on BCH. Wish me luck.
The main idea is to bet on cryptos, not on one crypto. Call me naive?!?

Time to go back to the mothership ladies
ie: That was the dip you were looking for
