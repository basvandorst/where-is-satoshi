Thank deity(), at least maybe now the media will stop taking interviews from the misinformed "CEO of Bitcoin".

Not counting funds received until confirmed should be a given. However, things could get awkward if it was an in-person transaction.
However, address reuse is a practice employed by many (most? all?) bitcoin mining pools, and at least one very active exchange:   Only difference I'm seeing there is the exchange is consistently paying ~250 sat/B in fees. Are you saying that with address reuse, higher fees would be necessary to ensure transaction confirmation?
Use of RBF and "proper" fee estimation is all great and wonderful. However, in making this human-approachable: is bitcoin core not doing proper fee estimation automatically? If not, what cross-platform wallet software would be appropriate?

That's exactly what we do: BTC payments are discounted by 10%, as credit/eCheck/paypal processing fees + associated chargeback fraud sharply increases costs of the traditional options.

Really? "I would tip more if you..." umm, danced nude, accepted euro (in the USA), accepted monopoly money, were christian... Really?
How about instead of such statements, we get an actual card out there that teaches, and doesn't antagonize, merchants.

Our bank (a credit union) recently switched to flat cards; no raised print anymore. Guess we know why others still haven't jumped onto that bandwagon.

Are they not even trying? We're a far smaller business (VPS hosting), and have been accepting BTC since around this time last year. Ever since we further automated our BTC checkout option, sales have shot through the roof; around 40 new build orders in the past month alone.
