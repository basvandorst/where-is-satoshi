Pretty sure if the government takes your love ones and start water boarding them until you give up your private key you will do it.

Bitcoin is propped up by tether, which is a fractional reserve.

You also get inflation with mining for bitcoin. Every day 1,800 bitcoins are added to the system. 
Also that the space question does not matter. As if we are going into space regularly to mine resources, then money is going to be irrelevant like in Star Trek.

You can get arrested if you find cash on the floor and not hand it into the police. You will get charged with theft.

You haven't lost until you sold.

Thats the thing people aren't fearful at all.  You think this is the bottom as if not, you would dumped your coins now and would be buying a bunch at the lower price i.e. if you brought in last December you could have 1 coin, if you brought now you could have 6 coins. Just a month ago people thought Bakkt would come out in November and we would rally to 11K.  Just a few weeks a big CNBC crypto expert claim we would value to 15K in December.
Nobody is fearful. Again why buy now when in a few months, Bitcoin could be less than 1K. Certainly people are going to start selling just to claim a taxable loss, it would be insane to buy now when its probably going to be cheaper in two weeks.

Your just gambling your money away. My brother works hard all week, but then just loses it gambling. Your just doing the same. If you was buying the dip all the past month, you would be down on money.
You say you don't try to time the market, but then you believe the market will go up in the next three years and your gambling everything on it. Warren Buffet would be horrified with your actions.
Its absurd to think you cannot time the market in the past few months, but you can time the market for what it going to be like in three years. Makes no sense at all.
