If I'm not mistaken, channels in the lightning network is what makes things tick. I've also heard that people essentially become payment gateways as transactions make their way across the network. The criticism I read was that this could potentially become a KYC/AML issue in the future.

I doubt you've met someone with his intensity though. I remember partying with him a few years back, and I kid you not. He would talk to everyone about Bitcoin.
E.g. See some attractive girls with Roger and one would think his goal in talking to them would be to score a number, flirt a little etc. Wrong. "have you heard about Bitcoin?" and he'd set them up with a wallet and give them a Bitcoin. This was in 2012. His passion is other worldly.

I'm sure he likes the fruits that socialism bares more than the fact that there is a government that redistributes the wealth.

The main difference being is that gambling has been around since antiquity, and it is legal in some parts of the world. I believe if even 1 country (likely the US) bans the use of bitcoin, others will follow suit quickly. I guess we'll see, but just for the sake of bringing it up, I think it's much more constructive for bitcoiners to tote the fact that there is intrinsic value in bitcoins utility, not the fact that you can evade tax (or think you can evade tax)

"Cryptographic-based monetary transmission systems and/or cryptographic-based monetary instruments". I'm not saying this would be done responsibly. The only thing that needs to be there is the fear of persecution for people to stop using it. It doesn't even matter so much that it cannot be practically stopped, or that they would ban it generally. Just my $0.02, but I hope you're right and it is much more difficult that my take.

My 2 Satoshis,
Bitcoin isn't a success. It's expensive, the technology is sound, there's indeed a lot more happening around it but... As I myself have run through what you've outlined, bitcoin is here in the way it is based mostly on its traded value. It's traded value is increasing because people have learned that... Because it's deflationary, it's likely to continue to increase in value. The same thing would happen if another thing called mittcoin was invented first and had the deflationary principle backing it. 
I think it's likely to entrench itself more on this fact alone, even though it is superior to traditional money in almost every use case. Other, perhaps better technologies (protocols) are already here. What to watch is the potential use cases for these coins, and how entrenched they get in their own segments. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:59:12

Bitcoin is very traceable. One might say it is the most traceable form of asset that exists, especially once it is cashed out to FIAT.
You raise a good point for the anonymous coins though (Monero, zcash). I think that the prevailing opinion you'll find here is that corruption has been institutionalized, and so long as you're part of that clique, it doesn't really matter.

yeah.. I've tried to explain that the bitcoin mining is essentially just the computing of complex math (which I don't think is accurate, but I thought it made it more digestible), which takes time, and therefor the product (a bitcoin) is inherently rare. the traits of the currency are what makes the demand, which gives it value.

How much does your bank charge to do a currency conversion? Mt.Gox does currency conversion, so it is subject to the longstanding practices of banks. If they were just converting bitcoin to some other digital cash, yes there would maybe be a reason to complain. However, they have to convert to USD somehow (through a bank), so I don't think this is unreasonable.

@_date: 2013-09-14 00:30:18
+90% of the money supply are entries in a database/ledger. The money we hold are physical tokens, no different than private keys out in the wild (qr codes/physical bitcoins). In this sense, it is almost identical, and the only real difference is that the value of the currency is based on its utility, scarcity and of couse the speculation that goes on in the market, as opposed to the self-interest of Governments. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:53:56
I don't understand what you mean? I have loaned money and paid it back to friends family. Charging interest does not make it a loan, it makes it a loan with interest. Also, making interest off of a loan doesn't guarantee you'll get paid back (won't get screwed). If I don't trust someone to pay me back, I won't loan money to them, regardless of whether or not I will make some interest. I understand it's a pretty unorthodox view point I hold, but my points above should address what your point is. The main question is, why would anyone loan WITHOUT interest? ;)

@_date: 2013-04-25 10:37:30
I understand the point you are trying to make, but I have to disagree (at least on your calling it "charity", and your previous point that money won't be paid back. Charity is a gift to those who need it. It isn't supposed to be paid back in kind. I think myself and others would be offended if I took out a loan (without interest) from a family member, paid it back, and they called it "charity" to me.  I mean, I put my own effort in to pay them back, after all.
The people/institutions who give out loans have the money (or the instruments to make the money) the money, or they wouldn't be able to lend in the first place, right? The fact that they apply interest does not change the money they have in their bank account (either they have it to give, or they don't). It's a bit besides the point, but there are indeed loans that are given to business that are given without interest. The Grameen family of companies are a good example. 
There is a set amount of money in the economy, whether or not there is interest doesn't change the amount of money available. It only affects the "owner" classes capital, not money outright. 
I argument is that interest doesn't "need" to be applied, it is just an instrument of capitalism that keeps the owners endowed, while actually contributing very little. 
I'll apologize in advance, I didn't watch the videos yet, but I will and let you know if I reconcile my point.

Even that. Strange that the prevailing culture thinks that people who make no active contributions to an investment are entitled to a bonus. Either you trust someone to pay you back, or what they are doing to pay you back, or you don't. interest is just... Greed :/
