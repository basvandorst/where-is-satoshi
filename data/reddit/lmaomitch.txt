I have a job and earn my own. Thanks for the useless comment though.

OP is making a very valid point and everyone in the comments is defending themselves, so I don’t think I’m the one who’s butt hurt.
It’s a very new technology that has an interesting infrastructure but unregulated currency will never become successful. Governments will need to regulate it or bitcoin will never succeed in the long term.
Just because you put $10 into bitcoin a few years ago doesn’t make you a stock market genius.

This sub is full of morons who have very little knowledge in genuine investing but rather got lucky on Bitcoin.
