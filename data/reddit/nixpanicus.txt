So instead, he has a plan that only people with an unnecessarily slow dipping mechanism and a pool full of sharks can participate in. And he doesn't even watch it, he just hodls and hopes it all works out. And then of course Austin Powers escapes and foils his scheme because the whole shark plan was incredibly dumb. Again, a perfect comparison to bitcoin.

Acceptable, because sea bass actually exist and are useful, while laser sharks are fake, dangerous, poorly thought out and incredibly inefficient. Finally we agree.

Its especially apt because the scene is Dr. Evil explaining an overly complicated scheme that inevitably fails to an incredulous Scott who doesn't understand why he doesn't just use smarter and more direct methods that will actually work.
This is basically the perfect Bitcoin post.

Again, we're talking intrinsic value. So if you were on the moon with no radio connection how would you send it? What value would it have without the internet? At least I can make a fancy hat out of gold

And then it was 77% in 1918

Im curious. What value do you think bitcoin intrinsically has? If you were on the dark side of the moon and had a bitcoin but no radio connection to Earth, what could you do with it?

Apparently you dont know what intrinsic means, which I guess makes bitcoin perfect for you

Not to the farside of the moon. Look, youre missing what the word intrinsic means here. Bitcoin has no value without a network. You cant eat it, drink it, wear it, or do anything useful with it except trade it for something else that is useful. It has an intrinsic value of zero. Its only useful as a store of value and nothing else, and if the complex global infrastructure of the internet goes offline it can't even do that

Thats not strictly true. Precious metal prospecting and mining have fluctuated in response to price changes. Turns out there is a *lot* of gold and silver in the ground if you've got the tools to go dig it up. But because bitscoins are BACKED BY MATH it is impossible to change elasticity.
Incidentally, sudden new sources of metals flooding into markets (like Spain stealing gold out of the New World) caused havoc with the European economy. Its going to be great when some of those primordial coin stashes start moving in the FULLY BITSCOINED FUTURE and tank a global economy unable to adapt. The bitscoin future is gonna flounder because some dude found a coin stash on a USB drive.
