Good point. If I know how to use it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:54:59
Right. That was the first thing I thought of is not many peeps buy stuff with alt-coins good point. They are used mostly for speculation.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:39:31
You really going to be that person? God.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:21:30
I mentioned my site once and you have a hissy fit. Give it a break dude.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:40:26
Haha probably true. I hear your point totally I just figured this might a useful and hopefully somewhat profitable adventure ;)
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:43:09
this is a general question ...could have been even for Bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:43:03
Amazing hello senator!  Thanks for coming on r/Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:05:14
It was more of a quick conversion for people. Not so much a merchant type service i.e., BitPay but similar.  Just if people wanted to quickly exchange into their coin of choice without having to go through an exchange.

I figured by your name this must be what you do ;-) . I'll hit up if I need it!
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:27:51
We are talking about that right now :
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:22:05
Haha leechcoins very descriptive.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:01:17
Thanks PotatoBadger! 
At the moment I don't think IRC but we'll see. The only help that will be needed will be anyone to help answer questions at some point. I'll circle back around and let you know what pops up as something eventually will.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:24:28
Ya, I hear you. I have a lot of ideas but never have anyone to go in on them with me.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:41:17
I'm liking what you are coming up with. In fact, I really like it.  ~~PM Me.~~
PM sent.

@_date: 2013-12-02 05:54:19
I can't find the r/thread for it haha but yes there is an alt-tip bot :)
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:21:53


I can have it where people can log into webcam streaming in the chat itself? And even do 1 on 1 chat via it.


I agree it can be fairly tiring this is true. Your fingers so fall off eventually.


Awesome feedback!  Would you ever be a person who would help field questions?
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:27:01
Cool k. I'll PM you.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:02:27
Ah thanks!  Just looked it over . I think its for "general chat" I'm going to focus on really *helping* people.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:12:05
Take care and good luck! I'm almost at the same point.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:49:49
They have an alt-coin tipper bot already ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:45:12
Set up each senator's profile on [BitcoinStarter]( so people can give them a Bitcoin each LOL
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:46:10
Point is this is about Bitcoin as much as it is about MegaCoin ? Swap out the words MegaCoin with Bitcoin its the same thing. I can edit it to say Bitcoin would that help? Talking about a service not what the crypto currencies are.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:57:32
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:40:21
They just bought a million dollars of Bitcoin that is why.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:36:17
you missed it about half hour ago .
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:42:17
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:07:18
Right. Trying to be a little quicker then an exchange but I get your point.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:40:16
Cool. I'll check it out.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:45:03
Yes, I figured it would get some heat mentioning the "others" but in reality we are all one big family.  OoooO I do like cryptxpay.com! :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:30:45
Not spamming!  this is for helping people with questions.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:09:18
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:42:40
Mine is still saying you have to wait 4 days ( friday, Nov. 22nd ) so not sure if people can get it right away still.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:01:16
I saw it on some tweet with the buy it had to be someone big like CoinBase.
