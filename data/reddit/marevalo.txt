Not anti state enough, I want also the state out of the human relationship business.

Can the FED be sold freely by its owners to somebody with lots of money?... Then it's not private

A sincere question: How can any currency compete with a state issued one?  When the bubble goes up you have"free" dollars/euros, when the bust comes the state will bailout the dollar/euro with taxes you will be forced to pay (like now). Until we separate the state from currency Bitcoin is a hard sell.

How can the bitcoin compete with governments' money if the governments have, on top of central banks, the option to rescue their currencies with forced taxes?

Even if that it's true (that is not) then a normal life would be dying in your infancy. Why are you entitled to have more chances...

These sentences are full of vague and weasel words like "normal", living 30 years and starving each and every day of your life was a normal and good life for centuries, I don't know why are you entitled for something better...

As there won't be any fractional reserve banking on Bitcoin you should compare with M2 and not M1.

You couldn't find a worst game to teach economics, be it with Bitcoin or any other currency.
