Did drivechain ever work? I heard a lot of noise, and then nothing.

Yes, I totally disagree with Erik's assessment, though I respect it. He is equating BFX to Mt. Gox, and I don't believe the two cases are comparable at all, for the reasons I mentioned.


Oops, sorry, I was referring to the frappacino-loving Mt. Gox insider. He has been charged but not convicted, so all I can say is that the insider's name might rhyme with Karp Marpeles.

Bankruptcy proceedings typically rack up fees in the 1% range. Even Mt. Gox seems to be no exception.
I'd have expected Mt. Gox to be far more complex though. It was likely a frappacino-loving insider, who took years to set up and operate the hollowing out. It will most definitely take years to sort out the mess, and if our attacker is any good (and people who know him say that he's good), we may never get anything out. 
A good question to ask is "why are the legal processes associated with bankruptcy so efficient?" Remember that people and corporations go bankrupt literally all the time. The process is quick, efficient, and, most importantly, equitable. 
So I don't believe BFX is at all comparable to Mt. Gox.

I think he is planning to send them over a 56k modem.

Fake news.

What is it with people who wish ill on others just so their portfolio appreciates a tiny bit?
Bitcoin should rise on its own merits, regardless of other bubbles.

Isn't this an altcoin? Or a fork?

Yet it's not "hilariously ironic" that Peter Todd doesn't understand irony. We've come to expect of him that he'll talk about concepts he does not understand.

Do those work? Last I checked, they required trust.

It's anything but.

Agreed. It shouldn't be, but is treated as such.

What would Lysander Spooner say about Bitfinex socializing their losses by taking everyone's money?

This looks like a simple troll attack, trying to resurrect some irrelevant news from 4 years ago. Many traders sell on bad news and reenter the market.
Selfish mining was a significant discovery, and it meant bad news. It's part of the reasoning behind small blocks. Adam Back was referring to it on a mailing list just yesterday. 
Emin has done much for Bitcoin, and these kinds of attacks, based on an out of context tweet from 4 years ago, look pathetic.

Where did he say it was "dead"?
He did say it was broken, and then showed that a belief everyone took for granted was indeed broken. We thought the protocol was safe as long as no miner reached 51%, and he showed an attack that succeeds at 34%. This attack is cited constantly by both sides in the block size debate, because it is fundamental.
This kind of attempt at attacking someone based on an ancient quote, out of context, looks pathetic.
