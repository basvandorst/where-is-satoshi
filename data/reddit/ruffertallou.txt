Same way you get scammed buying things on craigslist. Someone takes your money and leaves.

wtf $2k/mo?
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:24:40
That's like $12.50/hr... before tax. I have friends in retail that make more than that.

Yes. So fewer businesses with low profit margins will exist. Profit margins will increase. An equilibrium will be found that is different from today's. That's not necessarily a bad thing.

Here's some public[1] numbers from a school with a co-op program: 
Your salary is below the average hourly rate offered to first year students of every major.
[1] albeit highly massaged to be lower than reality. Areas with high costs of living are oddly missing from these counts. They tend not to count interns from the bay area and nyc.

No one is going to sell you a put on the BTC/Foocoin exchange rate.

No one is going to sell you a put on the BTC/USD exchange rate either. That doesn't mean it can't grow big.
I do agree with most of your points, but this one doesn't seem especially practical.

The "hp backdoor" was a support root account on their products with a username of goph3r5.

I'm with you on that, but unfortunately writing bitcoin options is just astronomically risky.
An option trade is essentially a bet on a security's volatility, and absolutely no one wants to bet against bitcoin being volatile. It's just too vulnerable to black swans.

No it's not.
I did not pay for reddit. The advertisers did. I am not stealing.

Every financial transaction has counterparty risk. Yes, this sucks. However, the risk of this should have been assessed before you put critical assets into a magic the gathering online exchange. As everyone in this community says: don't gamble with money you can't afford to lose.

It is a superior money to what we have today. There is no benefit of fiat currency over bitcoin, except for the size of its community.


If something better comes along, the protocol is critically flawed beyond repair, or a significant part of the network is controlled by a single party, making me vulnerable to excessive counterparty risk.


If something better comes along. I'm in this purely for myself, not for some idealist attachment to this paticular idea.

Litcoin does not add value that is not added by bitcoin. Its existence is redundant, and therefore it is worthless.

Sorry, I should have been more specific: I was referring more to the put option than the call, which I assume interests you more for the purposes of hedging. No one in their right mind would write a put option in BTC.
...that I know of. Maybe you're aware of a strategy that would work that I'm not?
