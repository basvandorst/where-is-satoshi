Bitcoin can be seized. There's nothing that can be block from gouvernement...  They have all the rights. They can take your land, proprety anything they want. They can also take your life, children and kill you. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 15:43:25
It's funny how all bitcoiner think it's the future, everything will be crypto when there's still people afraid of debit card and don't want to use them because it's evil or whatabout false reason. People a lot, still pay with money and still to do their payment with letter, etc.  
@_date: 2018-08-17 07:16:44
Not by the government. The bank itself can't do anything with these data. They have not right to sell these info. Only on crime, investigation they can access these data. Also bitcoin don't make it less traceable.

Not it's not. Black market convert dollars in bolivars. It's not the banks that are guilty.

In peer-to-peer model it's wrong. More users mean more power consume... 
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:47:07
Have you any metric to provide? Please elaborate. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:45:10
This is wrong. Inflation was not a result of creating money. The main reason are corruption not because banks creating money. 
Also need to take in count that creating money cost real money. Currencies are protected and cost to be made. Printing material etc. There's no free energy.

There's no half hashrate missing. Do your really understand or just throw keywords ? I have more power and therefore undo your fork. Nothing can prevent that and you will notice it when it's too late. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:36:32
The cost is true. That come from hacker, not crypto slave. BTW you know cloud? You don't need hardware... 
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:40:12
First I don't want do that, but there's a plenty motivated specially if the money rise. More value mean also more people motivated..  And this is only one of attack that can be possible.
@_date: 2018-06-12 09:22:20
You don't understand how the attack work. If you have better calculation then, share your finding with them and let see how much you will be mocked. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:18:04
Total bullshit. Another proof that bitcoin people are not nerd and don't know math. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:10:17
Where's the guide about not buying bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:56:38
Today it's my birthday and I would also let you know how badly the community of bitcoin are. Full of comic, no tech guy, like flat earth believer: You Are wrong. Have a good day. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:57:53
Lol, caps lock your argument make it better... 
@_date: 2018-06-21 21:13:23
Everybody was amazed about going from less that 1 mhz to 3ghz, dual, triple, Octo...  What's big now, will be nothing later, like bitcoin "math" evolution. Same with crypto from ceaser cipher, md5, sha1, sha256, etc. Until it collapse like all. 
Ps, nice comment about other type of problems of the whole system. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:03:59
They would notice when it's too late. What the goal? You need to stop before.  latest exploit was using by nsa year and nobody noticed. Openssl ? NO ONE NOTICED 
@_date: 2018-06-16 11:01:06
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:46:52
You don't need to own the miner but can have a pool of botnet, using the graphic card of people browsing your site, etc. You only think about one way of doing it. This is not hacking. The attack can be really fast before the community see anything. The cost is only a virtual cost, also as you mine, you still get money and thus reduce the amount required. You can imagine a bot that start to grow and more he have money, the more he start stealing money when able, then goes back in idle mode.
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:59:07
Like a really need to be connected on your poor mining pool...or can't hide between pool. Come on grow and do something of your life. Or at least imagine how informatics work and how it's not secure. Mr fanboy.

Meltdown almost survived 23 years before some find it. yeah, computer are "secure"
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:16:58
Almost all the coiner have different view about what he represents. For you he mean the future, etc. for other it's only a way of making money. 
Also, generally p2p, is decentralized. You don't need to double your argument. Because p2p meant to be decentralized... 
Also deflationary is not always negative and can be a benefit. The argument about deflation or inflation is truly above your understanding.

Bitcoin and Christians are well together because both believe in something that don't exist. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:18:54
Finally all the crypto and specialy the bitcoin is dying. I'm happy that this is a new start. A new start for all these evangelist of new technology that doesn't understand a word about it, they can find another things to preach. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:03:27
If you can't exchange there's no value.
Even currency now worth nothing, like old German fiat, esducdos, etc. There's a lot of them. It's not because some collectors will buy them that they really worth something.
Value is what you give to them,  if you want buy sand for 10000$ the once it's just up to you... Same apply with crypto if people think they worth something it's up to them.
The crash will be hard.

And you still are idiot. Go focus on your drinking problem.  
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:11:15
Or 0$ like you want. Nobody will want to buy bitcoin.  Only retard do this 
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:54:56
If Banks can collapse, then why not bitcoin? If the network stop, there's no more value, no more exchange. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:39:32
BTC = Bit in culito 
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:20:58
Yes, scammers was abusing the cancellation after transfer. Where's your bullet proof technology ? You are the only idiot here. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:34:10
Dotcom bubble and crypto have the same base users that want buy things that they don't understand. 
Yeah I'm looking at you guys that have watched YouTube video and think that your understand how crypto works ( but still don't know how repair your computer). 
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:03:57
People believe what they want. They don't need owning it in order to do so. I don't believe in any future in crypto,  all this shit will collapse but I own some shittycoin, mined and know how technology works. Not like all the crypto fans that pretend to know something.
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:38:18
Too good to be true

Thinking that things can be unique on Internet is not knowing the technology and how Internet works. So dumb naïve.

Nothing to do with bank or bitcoin and this is normal. Don't pay,  let's be seized.  Lesson of life. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 09:48:49
You are totally wrong. This kiddos thing that we still in school. How old are you 12? Come on. The comment is for comment you can even put the old joke of Osama Ben laden and nothing will happen. In a case of a bank doing so, you are free to change to another bank. Personal fake story don't create proof.
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:15:23
Hey but arguing because there's some niche people that like to collect are not relevant to a whole population. They will not buy it. Like your shell example. It's not because they collect them that they worth something.  Only for them, when they will die because everything die at a time then all the shell will be destroyed,  trow away. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:03:15
I watch the bitcoin drop and I like that. Stop spreading bullshit.  Buy, buy the dip and then when it will be over don't forgot what I say. Enough bitcoin will change the world and make little African having something to eat.

No. I'm not from the U.S. and I don't support things that can be used as scam.

@_date: 2018-07-01 19:36:38
I don't have any advantage of moving from fiat. I can understand and don't trust central banks too, but I don't see the future of bitcoin. Only people that want to make money of it. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:14:42
The bank don't want having any risk with your poor investment. It's normal that they don't want suffer from it.

US controlling the world currency I loled, Europe is not egal to only greece. Too many bs argument. BTW you don't understand how Europe is working. Focused on US is better than everything. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:50:25
Not by Chinese, 3000bc. If fiat don't survive 200 years, do you think that fast moving technology will last 200 years? So funny.

Why the fuck you publish people in this picture? You are not allowed to take pics like this and publish it. Just capture your crap machine is enough.

You need to pay taxes regardless if you make money from bitcoin or cutting grass... It's not relevant and we clearly see your lake of knowledge.

Because we want to warn you about the damn hype over blockchain when there's no hype at all.  and your are facing a wall and will crash against. 
All non tech people think that blockchain is the future etc. This is bullshit.

You need to see negative things in order to see what need to be changed.  
If you see only positive things nothing will change.

It's hate that bring war but not criticism.
