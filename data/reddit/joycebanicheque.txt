I'm bullish on bitcoin for the near future, a year or 2, but I'm sure that someone will create an improved cryptocurrency within that time.
And since knowledge of bitcoin will continue to expand, it will be easier for current and new users of cryptocurrency to join that improved cryptocurrency.
edit: Huh, I guess it's my cake day

It's on my computer, and my internet can be wonky sometimes, so I shutdown some background processes while gaming on skype with friends.
Does getting back up to date every other day have more of a negative than not running a full node?

I started running a full node on my computer a month ago, when I'm not playing games.  I recently learned that having too few connections is can actually hamper the network.
I usually have between 10 and 30, is that enough so that I'm actually helping?

I just use bitcoin core on my computer and usually have ~30 connections while streaming video and playing computer games (no idea if that has any effect on it).
Is more than 30 high?  I think the highest I've seen is 33 connections.
Should a dedicated hardware node do better than the one I run on my computer?  Or does it not work like that?

Also I can never find myself on [Bitnodes](
Any idea why?

I allow incoming connections and it's usually about 30 active connections.  It's just that the closest dot I see on Bitnodes is over 30 miles away from where I am.
