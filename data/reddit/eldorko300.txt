But probably the best way to *invest* in crypto.
Lots of people dont give a fuck about actually possessing the bitcoins

It's not wholesome, it's a circle jerk
@_date: 2019-10-15 05:19:12
Because hes shitposting and spamming advertisements for his book
I'd super double downvote him if I could.

This is actually probably the worst sub I'm for some reason subscribed to.
It's either really really fucking stupid or aggressive kool-aid like shilling

These days, Guy Fawkes mask is more indicative of an immature neckbeard type that thinks anarchy is cool but has no real values on a functional society or economy

This sub is terrible.
I dont know why I'm subscribed, every time I see a post on my front page, it is so fucking dumb
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:09:27
So, this entire subreddit basically?

Also I'm not sure why, but is seems like everyone here has had wayyyy too much kool-aid to drink, if you know what i mean. 
I'm not sure if it's just a desperate effort to dissuade people from selling so they retain more value, but it's just so fuckin transparent.
Just a bunch of shills,delusion, and low effort memes
@_date: 2019-09-12 04:29:02
Why is this sub so shitty?
Is there a better crypto/btc sub that is not just 90% of posts retarded memes desperately shilling bitcoin?
