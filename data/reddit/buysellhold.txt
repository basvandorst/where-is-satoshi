@_date: 2014-01-28 00:23:16
the price was dropping and making my coins worth less and less. if i sold them later i would lose more. planning ahead

You have got to stop making these. They're not funny at all. Everyone is encouraging you for trying. Like parents who want their kids to try new things, but holy shit these are not funny.

You can see in the charts. Look at the crash before. it hit the bottom and then didnt go any lower. going to wait until it gets to the bottom and i'll get a few more
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:18:33
