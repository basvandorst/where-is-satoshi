I guess I shouldn't get my hopes up. I have 0.26 BTC on there that I forgot about and need their help resetting my 2FA. Haven't heard back in 3 days, but if they haven't responded to you in that long, I'm thinking I may not have a chance.

Hey all, I recently built [CoinCab.io]( a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker/calculator that supports multiple crypto/fiat pairs. More pairs and features will be added as well. If it's missing a fiat option you'd like to use, let me know! It's a PWA so you have the option of saving it to your mobile home screen and running it like a native mobile app.
Data is aggregated and comes from CryptoCompare.
I also made browser extensions for the app.

Would love to hear your input. Hope you enjoy!

Hey all, I recently built [CoinCab.io]( a live price ticker and holdings calculator that supports multiple crypto/fiat pairs. More pairs and features will be added as well. If it's missing a fiat option you'd like to use, let me know! It's a PWA so you have the option of saving it to your mobile homescreen and running it like a native mobile app. I'm also working on a portfolio dashboard feature, so you'll be able to add multiple options onto one dashboard. Also the code won't be plagiarized.
