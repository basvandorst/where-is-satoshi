I use Bittrex and have had no issues. But if you leave your crypto on their exchange then your at the mercy of their security. It's deff safe to use to exchange/buy tokens but just make sure to transfer them to your wallet when done.

It's not really that hard.

Oh ok, sorry about that. I had the app but I found it to be worthless. I just go right to the site on my iPhone instead. As far as the app being safe, I have no idea. Sorry for wasting your time.

Sure, buy alt coins the night before the fork and watch them all go green the next day. By the time you get your 2x coins from coinbase and they allow you to use your bitcoin and 2x again, because I’m sure they will have a hold on it for security reason. IMO, bitcoin will pry be down around 5k and 2x will probably be worthless. Obviously this is my opinion and I’m sure someone else can handle this question a bit better.

Whatever you do, do t watch this... I can’t believe he just... holy fuck..

Yes they will match whatever is in your wallet. But I’d expect them to hold/freeze both your coins for some time for “safety” reasons... by the time they allow you to move your funds bitcoin could b worth a lot less and 2x could be dead already. Nobody really knows.

Did this to me as well, if I remember correctly I had to finish my setup, taking pictures of my ID. Just check to make sure all your info is in and you have 2 form verification enabled.

Yep, not at all what I was expecting
