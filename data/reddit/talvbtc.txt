Went to The D earlier and it was a little bit of a disappointment. 
Their marquee says "Bitcoin accepted here" but the staff is mainly confused and points you to the Bitcoin ATM. That  required all kinds of personal data and my social security number (not from the US so I don't have one).
One of their Kiosks accepted BTC but I didn't have data, they don't provide fee Wifi, so I couldn't use it.

No, and it's not my job to do that. The flight tickets that I paid with the same CC should have been a hint, but I guess their COBOL needs another patch.


Yeah, why not waste my precious time and roaming charges begging for access to my money. I wrote them an email and their response was "we're looking into it"


They gave zero indication that anything is wrong and did not move a finger to provide me access to my own money.

Your knowledge about banking systems is pretty amazing, but not quite complete. Unfortunately it's only the card cancellation number that is free of charge, not the service number I was supposed to call. 


Not much. I got a free burger out of it!

I googled for "Bitcoin ATM" and landed at

It was a European number. 
You're completely right, I could have pulled out the Terms Of Services, figured out if, and under which circumstances, the bank will carry the cost of the potentially very expensive phone call. On the other hand, the fact that they did not lift a figure to contact *me* is a clear indication that they don't give a rat's ass about their customers in this situation.
So why bother when I have a better alternative?
