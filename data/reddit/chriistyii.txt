Sure - Coinbase is pretty secure and a hardware wallet is the BEST option, but just Google "exchange hacked" and there is certainly plenty to read on a lot of people losing a lot of money. All of this is a great topic to be discussed!

I don't know if I would use the word "bad." But there is definitely risk in storing your coins online. If you plan to keep those coins long term, I would store in a desktop wallet or even better - a cold external wallet.

If you have a better, actionable recommendation for keeping your coins safe (especially for those who have invested a large amount of $) I am sure the community would love to hear :)

Well, you're right...and as stated in the guide, for the average investor, most of the time the exchanges are just fine to store cryptos in. If you're investing a large amount though (or whatever amount you would be heartbroken losing through a hack), I would really not recommend keeping it in an exchange. Part of getting the mainstream aware, educated, and getting past the learning curve is just knowing that these desktop wallets exist and the benefits of using one! :)

If you transfer your coins from Coinbase to GDAX, you don't pay a transfer fee.
