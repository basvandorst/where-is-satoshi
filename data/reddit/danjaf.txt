Here's my 'tinfoil hat' version of a secure paper wallet. Take the paperwallet.com sourcecode using the browser of a 'clean' os. Preferably new install of a hardened operating system (see CentOS etc..). 
Then move that code using a clean USB or other removable media. 
Load paperwallet.com code on a freshly installed OS on a computer that is completely offline. Preferably on a computer that will never go online. 
Create paperwallet. 
Print paper wallet over USB cable. 
Remove/format/destroy printer's RAM. 
Put tinfoil hat in the wash.

I would suggest that if you do repeat the process again, do a whole bunch paper wallets and store those away for the future. And buy a fireproof box.

Agreed. There must be a way to create a wallet using HTLM5 and offline data storage. If I was to guess, Blockchain.info might be working on such a webapp. 
With that said, it's hard to trust Apple after that grievous 'error' in their SSL framework. But I would be fine with a webapp that held my private keys for a very small amount of funds.

3rd this. One of the brightest people to spit about crypto. He's definitely my kind of nerd.

Actually setting up a few coinpunk servers right now. My real job has stalled the project, but so far, so good :)

Setup a coinpunk server. VPN to server. iOS restrictions bypassed.

Your parents appear to have some kind of personality disorder. I can't imagine a parent that wouldn't be proud of their child taking a risk and having it pay off. And even if your risk with Bitcoin didn't pay off, they should still be proud of you trying something new and taking a risk. Parents are suppose to be attachment figures who help their children through the best and worst of times. As a parent, I am trying to show my kids that its better to fail than succeed. Failure begets learning. 
In my opinion, you should create firm boundaries with your parents. Just because 'they raised you' does not mean you owe them anything more than respect. 
I would suggest you pick up a DSM IV (4) (psychological diagnostic manual) and get an idea of what kind of personality disorder your mother and father have. It wouldn't be a proper diagnosis (that would require proper psychological testing), but it might give you an idea about what kinds of people you're dealing with (i.e., borderline, narcissistic, etc.)
P.S. Don't give them a fucking cent unless that what YOU want to do, not what others tell you to do.
