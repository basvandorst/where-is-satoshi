How did it work?? They just have an address you send it to or something? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:31:49
That's pretty nifty. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:55:21
Thank you for that! I feel like one of the cool kids now. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:01:14
Thank you very much for this. I'll give it a shot for my next time. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:43:34
Either way, you're still asking a very very stupid question. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:37:58
Then how do they end up on the wallet? Do they just hang out until the next time it's connected to something?
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:26:35
Want some open bobs too?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:17:07
Alright. What's hodl and fodl. I keep seeing these, but I'm too afraid to ask. I HAVE THE COURAGE NOW

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:01:46
I am, learn me harder.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:34:36
I'll shoot myself later for the shit cropping, I apologize.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:16:33
I'm not sure I fully understand what that is, even after reading your link.. Could anyone put it in stupid people words for me? I'm still learning all this as best I can
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:43:58
I see. So, if they're still stored on the chain doesn't that defeat the purpose of an offline hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:34:55
So if it drops. Is that a good time to buy and start saving them?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:19:23
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:44:23
Okay thanks! Any other super simplified graphics you might have a link to? 
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:00:15
Yes, you need external hardware to do it which isn't cheap. And it'll earn you like. 8 cents. So have fun
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:18:47
Well done. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:47:41
More than likely you're gonna hurt your work computer's feelings by trying to mine btc with it. And they'll know 
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:17:15
I'll be saving this to show people. Thanks friendo
@_date: 2018-05-10 18:20:02
Like. A Brazilian bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-08-04 19:34:08
Fuck that, I'll do meaningless replies instead
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:57:50
Wtf..? 
@_date: 2019-03-07 19:51:19
If every person disappeared right now, would the bots keep going on with each other?
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:34:51
Tried starting with step 2 this time.
Now own .0001mbtc more than I did before. This isn't working the way I expected
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:11:26
Can we get a how to for step 1?
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:34:26
Wellp. Your username holds up! I appreciate you
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:03:58
What the fuck
@_date: 2018-11-13 04:39:01
The real red flag
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:21:51
Awesome! I appreciate the info
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:16:30
What does it take to mine those smaller, less profitable altcoins?
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:10:13
How does that reward thing work? And what determines who gets it/how much it is?
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:14:43
Thanks, I'll pull up that FAQ to read more.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:35:31


It went back up to that from like 8k. Now it's going down. Then it'll go back up. Then guess what? It'll probably go down again. You sound impatient, friendo.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:53:48
I *only* fap in front of the camera
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:53:32
I'll save that so I can look it up when I get off work today. I appreciate you giving me all this info
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:06:20
So what's the difference of a public address? What other one do I have to use?
And are you talking about not giving it out to people I know, or to anyone online in general?
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:56:21
Okay neat. I don't really know any way to be "extra safe" when I use my wallet address, and that's why I was asking. Thought maybe I was missing something or made a mistake at some point.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:22:23
That was a really helpful eli5 of that, and I understood. Thanks so much!
