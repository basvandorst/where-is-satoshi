Ok I've done this ~~and it seemed to work~~, ty!  However, I'm not seeing any btc in the new electrum wallet yet...how long should I expect this to take? Should I expect a significant delay in the seed phrase restoring my wallet into the new software or does this mean there's a problem...

It was a file with a random string of letters making up the first portion followed by two extensions:
example.wallet.aes

Embarrassed to say I'm not sure how to get my private key...I definitely don't see an option to display my private key 
I do see something called my "Wallet Directory" on the wallet dashboard screen...don't suppose that's it?

Hey guys, thanks to all of you for the advice! And your patience for helping a noob out.  I'll look into all of it.  I'm taking it slow right now in order not to rush into anything and make things worse, I think I'll start by attempting the idea suggested and reporting back afterwards. I'll start with what I'm most familiar with and go down the list accordingly, if I didn't answer anyone's question it's because I wasn't quite sure of the answer yet!
As for what asked I don't remember the exact file extension and so I'll go and check that and post it when I know. Given the timezone I'm in and the fact I can't always access the PC in question I may not always be able to reply right away, so my apologies.

If I keep trying to restore my wallet using a seed/modifying it and it still doesn't work could that corrupt my existing wallet even further..?
Or can I try it as many times as I like and if it doesn't work then no harm no foul?
Also, I'll check the exact version my MultiBit HD wallet is, I'm not even 100% certain it's BIP39. I mean it should be right? I was under the impression Multibit HD was all BIP39..
