Unglaublich soviel Einsicht in der deutschen Politik. Leider nur weil dem Staat zu viel Geld dadurch flöten geht. Hier sind mir die Bewegung gründe aber egal das Ergebnis ist deutlich wichtiger

What gives the usd the value. NOTHING except buyers and sellers. There are people who sell there stuff but want maximum profit and then there are buyers who want pay as less as needed. In the middle of these both is the price born. There is no need of fiat for this system. Value is just a thought you give something.
