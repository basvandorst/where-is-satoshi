thanks but how do I convert that to btc?
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:42:51
If it weren't for mtgox's incompetency It would be over $200 
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:05:50
Buy now before it blasts through $160
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:02:49
Hahah alright thanks then, is there a site with the current rate?
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:33:32
Almost had me until I read "By the way, I am currently 14"
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:33:38
My blocks are updating right now, excited to see how much you sent me. Thanks so much :)
EDIT: hahahahaha  This guy checks out.

I was part of the (stupid) people that thought that back at $2 so imagine how I must feel. I bought a bunch a few weeks ago to sort of make up for it though.

Any porn site.

It's fake dude.

One day it will be "Bitcoin (and paypal) payment options"
@_date: 2013-04-07 10:39:02
There is a huge wait for mtgox verification and all the banks are open on the weekdays so people will be getting verified, transferring money and buying all week.

Fuck I need 4 hours logged in on the forum, will this still be running by then?
@_date: 2013-04-07 10:28:55
Think it's people preparing for the storm that's about to hit.
@_date: 2013-04-17 09:04:03
Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:27:34
Looking at $260+ now
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:18:27
The issue right now is mtgox, with new exchanges popping up we will hopefully get some proper trading happening. Mtgox's lag is really just helping create panic sells atm.

Bought in at $20 and felt like I was late, holy shit.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:37:06
I witnessed that as well, really made me feel more secure about holding onto my bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:03:07
I don't see it going to much further down, but maybe I'm being to optimistic. It just feels like it's got way to much momentum right now to just suddenly crash and burn. Especially with the ASICS coming out soon, I think it will slowly go up to $200 and stabilize there for a bit.

No it wouldn't. I doubt bitcoin could come bad from a crash like that now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:26:49
Come on $300
