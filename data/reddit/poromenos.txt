Yeah, I just bought a $2 game with Bitcoin, without preloading. This is huge, I don't know how everyone isn't shitting their pants at this.

Ah, I thought it wouldn't let me log in on a rooted phone either. I'll try again, thanks.

Jeez, the KeepKey is $240. Why not get a Ledger, it's dirt cheap.

Yeeeah, let's talk about more things we know nothing about.
@_date: 2015-06-15 01:22:35
Ouch, thanks for doing the work. By the way, I just upgraded my HW1 to the latest firmware (without the Ledger keycard seed) and electrum works about 5% of the time with it. In my experience, HW1 integration with Electrum is *super* finicky, which is too bad, because the two are my favorite software and hardware wallets.

Where *will* they take your bitcoin? You guys are talking as if Greece is some backwater country, compared to the rest of the world, which apparently uses Bitcoin as its main currency. I doubt there's that much of a per capita difference in Bitcoin awareness in Greece versus the rest of the world.

Sure, but a much larger amount of thinking.

Android penetration is about 60%, the rest is iOS. I think some grandmothers still use feature phones, though.

Possibly. Classic chicken and egg, but stripe makes it trivial to accept Bitcoin nowadays.
@_date: 2015-12-25 20:08:30
I went with HW1, which is pretty much the "guts" of Ledger, and I like it a lot. I got two because they were something like $15 for both, and it's very convenient. I'm not sure what Ledger offers more than the HW1, but the HW1 is just a hardware token, it works with Electrum and Mycelium and that's all I need. I do think they offer an online wallet component.
Everyone's transactions are getting tracked with a ledger, it's called the blockchain.

Err, non-Greek bank accounts have no limit. You can withdraw as much as you want (up to your debit card limit, I guess?) if you have a bank account that's from a non-Greek bank.
So, you know, LocalBitcoins and plain old ATM withdrawal are your only two options.

Why are you using PBKDF2 after the much weaker "100 rounds of SHA-512"? Someone who wants to discover the passphrase will just grab the filename and brute-force that much faster than the PBKDF2.

Not only this, but the 60 EUR/day limit is more than enough for the people of Greece, 50% of whom are lucky if they make 30 EUR/day. The ones who are absolutely devastated by this are companies, who can't import the products they need, and Bitcoin is useless to them if their distributors don't accept it.
This is a complete non-issue, and I wish bitcoiners would stop being so animated about it.

Hah, I love how people here all go "credit cards? They're the devil, who wants the government tracking them? Use cash or Bitcoin", and, in the same breath, "you can't even buy anything with a credit card".
Newsflash, you can buy almost anything with credit cards, but cash is more convenient, so it's used for the overwhelming majority of transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:31:00
No Greek banks have withdrawal charges. You pay a euro or so if you use a different bank's ATM to withdraw, which also goes for using a foreign bank card in an ATM. The rest of the comment is accurate, and you can still make limitless withdrawals from non-Greek banks.

Thanks for the info! Hopefully they push an update for the keyboard issue, the Raspberry Pi is really the easiest solution for an airgapped computer.
Thanks for the `btchipPersoWizard.py` recommendation as well, it should be pretty easy to adapt it to my needs!
EDIT: It turns out that you can't get a mnemonic from the seed, it's one-way. My current plan is actually something much easier, use an airgapped Raspberry Pi to create a mnemonic and "restore" the mnemonic on the HW1. I can even use my own dice rolls for this, so it's the most secure method I can come up with.

Paper wallets are less safe than a Trezor. It's not like the paper wallet gets used by you doing the calculations in your head. Paper wallets are only as secure as the app that uses the private key to sign.
My true "paranoia mode" is an airgapped Raspberry Pi with Electrum in signing-only mode. Then I can transfer the specific signature for the specific transaction over to another computer by typing it out, or by a QR code, which is pretty much what the Trezor does. It would be interesting to think about a Trezor with a camera and a display, which could then communicate via QR codes, rather than USB. Potential exploits would probably be visible to the eye, in that case.

You don't really need to hash random bits, but it doesn't hurt, so it's fine. AES only tells you to run PBKDF2 to derive a key for AES from a low-entropy passphrase, but you have a high-entropy key already, so running PBKDF isn't necessary. You can just hash the key once and use that, or use the key directly (but then you have 4 unused bits of entropy at the end).
Nice project, by the way! I'll definitely use it.
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:46:50
Could the remote code execution exploit result in compromised keys?

I have a hardware wallet that's a smartcard and signs transactions. I don't see why we can't have that, the terminal asks you to insert your card and the card signs the transaction. Of course, you aren't protected against merchants just siphoning off all your money. The alternative is "connect your Trezor/phone usb to pay", which I'm sure will happen eventually.

Yeah, you shouldn't be storing lots of coins on anything other than an airgapped computer or a hardware wallet, and for a few coins, most things are fine.
I think you may be able to use GreenAddress+Mycelium. I *think* the seeds are compatible.

I have a wallet from that company, what mine does is you connect it to another computer and it types out (as if it's a keyboard): "To send X BTC to Y, enter PIN ABCD". You enter the pin on the device you're sending from, and you're done.
Then again, I'm wondering what this whole thing protects against, since, if you have malware that will swap addresses to theirs, they can probably swap them on the screen as well.

I can see both sides of the argument here. is talking about US citizens in particular, which makes sense in context, but is a bit sensitive to the phrase "American citizen" from the many times it's used in a "vs everyone else" context.
Note particularly the not-uncommon US sentiment of "they hate us for our freedoms" etc (not in the GP's comment, but in general), when most developed countries are rather more free than the US (especially in Europe), and consider how it sounds to a European.

The tutorial just tells you how to initialize the HW1, the first link is the actual program, but it's only a prototype, as you mention. I was hoping I could do it like Electrum, where I just plug the HW1 in and Electrum discovers its public key, enabling me to keep it as watch-only when they HW1 is not plugged in.
I was hoping that GreenAddress would act like this, effectively allowing me to "log in" from any old computer just by plugging the HW1 in, but they use multisig, so it can't work like this.
@_date: 2014-08-14 19:12:09




That is utter nonsense. Do you have an actual technical reason, rather than invoking Gödel's incompleteness theorem and pretend like that proves anything about an algorithm?

That's actually a pretty good idea, signing and showing the QR code so they can get the transaction.

Also, I can't get to step 6, they still haven't sent me my verification email...
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:42:28
Right, thanks. So this isn't really persistent cold storage any more than a paper wallet is, it's more of a "cold storage until you actually use the thing once".
It's pretty good for storing funds long-term, but something like a Trezor should be much safer.
@_date: 2014-11-27 13:17:03
That's a nice guide, but your private key is still compromised when scanning. I would use Electrum to sign the transaction on the airgapped computer and transfer the signed transaction over to the other computer to transmit.
@_date: 2014-05-18 00:27:44
The service runs on AppEngine, so Google handles that.

@_date: 2014-12-08 00:19:05
For the truly paranoid, you *need* a hardware wallet. I have a HW1, it's very handy, but the initial seed storage is a bit of a hassle, since you have to have an airgapped computer you'll trash afterwards. For convenience, go with a Trezor.
I *did* say truly paranoid.
@_date: 2014-08-18 11:27:55
The guys who made Electrum (correction: Mycelium) are making a small flash disk thing that you stick into your USB-supporting printer and it shows up as a PDF of a paper wallet. That way, your normal printer prints paper wallets.
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:43:29
Thanks for that, even better.
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:53:57
Oh, cool. Can you tell me why it's only recognized by the programs 10% of the time? :( I'm trying to create a new wallet in Electrum and it keeps saying it can't find the dongle at random stages in the process.
Also, how can I convert the seed to a Mycelium-compatible wordlist? It would make backups *way* easier.
@_date: 2014-05-25 08:47:21
Seriously, why not do this? Mycelium's paper wallet is great, Electrum's deterministic wallet is also great. Store a few of those in a safe, and you're done. SD cards are unreliable as hell.

If I had to design a system like this, I would make it multisig, like you described, with multiple paper wallet backups in vaults somewhere (for safekeeping), and an airgapped (no access to the network at all), physically secured (no access to the room by anyone) computer that would sign the transactions and would communicate the signatures back and forth with QR codes.
However, dumping all this risk on a third party sounds fantastic.

Really? Which app supports it on a phone? I use it with Electrum, it works well enough but I won't consider it secure enough for storing all my funds until I back up the seed offline.
You *can* back up the seed in an airgapped Raspberry Pi or similar and then write it down, I've just been too lazy to write it down. The other problem is that it doesn't give you a list of words, it gives you a long hex string, which makes backing it up harder.
A Trezor is still a bit more convenient, with its screen that shows you the words, but you can buy 10 btchips for the price. What I also like about BTChip is that I can store my Mycelium wallet on it and access it from the computer, which Electrum doesn't natively do because of the different way the seeds are generated.
EDIT: What I would like is a single Python script that can work offline (so I can copy it to a raspi) and convert between the various seed formats. So, I would feed it (say) the BTChip seed and it would give me a Mycelium list of words, or vice versa with various compatible wallet software. I haven't been able to convert the BTChip to the Mycelium list of words anywhere.

@_date: 2017-03-06 18:45:21
Hmm, how does that work? You mean it's like a Linux distribution and boots into a seed generation UI for the computer? That's still kind of "risky" unless the computer is airgapped and unless you're going to destroy it later. If I'm going to trust Ledger, I'll just let their wallet generate the seed.

What you say does not follow. You say that someone could, potentially, in the future, using quantum computers, derive a private key from a public key, but that has nothing to do with address reuse. If they can do that, then your single-use address is equally boned.


That's far from "horrible", it's just "eeeeh, it's 99.999999999% fine, but why not be 0.000000001% safer".

@_date: 2015-08-10 10:11:14
You seem to be confused. There's nothing in reusing addresses that makes them easier to crack with quantum computers, you can crack reused and non-reused addresses equally easily. Also, quantum computers don't magically crack everything.
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:18:39
The issue is using a different address per transaction vs using the same address for many transactions.

That's the killer app, I agree. I wish I could buy a raspberry pi as easily as I can buy a bag of weed, but people seem to be more interested in how to get their btc to appreciate in value rather than how to get more retailers supporting it.

2. This still affects any address you spend from. If people can derive the private key from the public key at some point, Bitcoin is  completely and totally boned, and this is the least of your worries.
3. Again, this is an implementation problem. If you have bad entropy, it can bite you anywhere, it just happened to be in address reuse. If you implement a thing badly, it's not the thing that's the problem, it's that you implemented it badly.
I'm not arguing whether one should reuse addresses or not (personally, I don't reuse addresses, Mycelium works that way by default). Someone above said that reusing is "horrible", and I was asking for details on why it's horrible, which don't seem to exist. At most, it's "it may be slightly less secure at some theoretical point in the future when everything will be completely screwed, maybe".

To pick nits, there are no capital controls on outside funds coming in, it's the other way around. Also which restaurant accepts Bitcoin here?
@_date: 2015-07-01 12:54:13
It's 1800 Euros a month, which is more than the majority of Greeks makes. It's certainly a hassle, but delaying rent for a few days is nothing new these days. Companies, shops, etc, on the other hand, are facing a much larger problem, and are having to just shut down.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:42:24
Because Coinbase allows merchants to easily accept it... God, why do I even visit this subreddit?...
@_date: 2015-08-06 11:29:05
Yeah, store of value in a thing nobody particularly wants is the killer app!
@_date: 2015-08-09 09:20:02
Yeah, that doesn't mean you can't send as much as you want, it just means the site won't accept over $85.
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:46:21
Ah, thanks, then I'm not familiar with the meme.
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:32:55
Ouch, thanks. What's a better alternative?

And which of the two countries have you lived in?

Is that legit? I've seen allegations of money laundering, I don't want my account to get banned or get prosecuted or something.
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:56:47
I have an HW1, and as great as it is, that's pretty much what I do too. I always think of getting a Trezor, because it's shiny, but then I remember Mycelium is a great hot wallet, the HW1 is a great secure device, and there's nowhere I can spend Bitcoins anyway.
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:32:18
Is that legit? I've seen allegations of money laundering, I don't want my account to get banned or get prosecuted or something.
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:32:17
Too bad they're phasing it out :( The store has already stopped supporting it.
@_date: 2015-07-26 15:49:47
And it's definitely not because someone burned one million dollars for them.

Why not Xapo?

What does a photographic memory have to do with anything? You think someone is going to go paint a QR code from memory? If you're going for memorization, give them a wordlist backup of the private key, at least.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:45:25
It's much easier than that. All you have to do is call the person and have them read the fingerprint of their key back to you, and you can do the same.
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:24:41
Isn't the main selling point of Bitcoin that there can be no fraud?
@_date: 2015-07-13 09:50:23
Oh goddamn, can you guys get back to reality a bit, before I decide to finally unsubscribe? Seriously, what the hell?
This is how a conversation about Bitcoin with the typical person goes:
- Hey, have you tried Bitcoin? It's a new electronic currency that can't be taken away from you, it's great!  
- Hmm, that does sound great, what can I buy with it?  
- Uhh, nothing, currently. Or maybe Euros, if you find someone willing to sell. But you can trade them with other users, but nobody really accepts them.  
- Yeeeah, where do I sign up...
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:16:56
Where's your mailing list? I would also definitely like to become an alpha tester.
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:11:24
I wonder if it'll work in Greece. NFC (touchless) terminals are everywhere here.
@_date: 2015-07-25 22:50:47
Hmm, this suggests around 0.4 mBTC per KB as the cheapest and fastest, but Mycelium's "priority" setting is just 0.2. The "economic" setting is 0.01, even, which makes 0.4 mBTC sound pretty damn expensive for a transaction...
@_date: 2015-07-05 02:28:06
There is not a single instance where holding bitcoins is better than holding Euro notes. Hell, it'd be easier to mail 1,000 EUR in Euro notes than try to convert the equivalent from BTC. You guys seem to think that Bitcoin is better than cold, hard cash in a crisis, and I want some of whatever you're smoking.
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:53:55
What? You said "no man in the middle", which is demonstrably false, because you're trusting a site with it. What does checking out the code have to do with what you said?
@_date: 2015-07-24 21:59:06
I see, thanks for the reply. Is it for the US Amazon only, by the way?
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:31:18
Sure, but the pebble is still useless. I must be missing some salient piece of information.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:12:42
Ugh, seriously... Is there any place I can visit to get updates on more sites supporting Bitcoin without this ridiculous circlejerk all day?
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:47:54
If you think you can protect against the NSA targeting you specifically, I've got news for you: They've already been to your house, and your car, and your computers, and your phones, and everything you own. You're not going to beat them with Tor.
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:03:11
Again, you make two unrelated points. I'll break them down for you:
1) **Quantum computers can derive private keys from public keys.**. Yes, they can, they can do it faster than traditional computers, but still not instantly. Also, quantum computers don't exist yet, at least none that can do anything useful.
2) **Address reuse makes private keys easier to crack using quantum computers**: You haven't shown anything that indicates that this is true. You just said "if you reuse addresses, quantum computers can find your private key, if you don't, they can't", which is wrong in both its claims.
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:01:54
Except it's nothing like pegging at all. There's no central authority where you can exchange the pebble back in return for the money.
Unless you meant pegging in the "penetrated with a dildo" sense. That analogy makes more sense.
@_date: 2015-08-06 21:23:40
Like when a pizza cost 50,000 BTC? Yeah, you know what, you're right.
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:38:05
The GP back there said:


So he's claiming the burning lets you set the price for the pebble at $1000 now.
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:27:40
Do you guys seriously not see what you're doing? There's nothing here that says people *will* start paying that much. The act of you burning the money does *nothing* to convince people to pay the money you just burnt. If they pay it, they'll do it regardless of whether you burnt yours or not.
@_date: 2015-07-24 23:25:38
Which site was it?
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:04:41
How fast is Litecoin?
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:49:38
Burning money doesn't make the pebble work something, you're making a faulty assumption there. It's still a useless pebble.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:37:07
Right, I already subscribed to that one, I'm not sure if he means a dev mailing list or something, though. Probably just means that one.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:46:00
What do you mean "No man in the middle"? This is the definition of man in the middle (that's the website).
@_date: 2015-07-19 21:48:18
This article is outdated and based on a rumour. Banks will open normally tomorrow and access to safe deposit boxes are unrestricted. Not only that, but bank staff will prioritize serving safe deposit box holders as they expect high numbers of them.

Hmm, maybe...
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:26:46
Hmm, that's weird, I've definitely bought humble bundles with Bitcoin the past weeks. Odd.

Ah, thanks. I had a feeling it'd be in Athens, I'll keep an eye out for it next time I'm there.
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:52:03
You don't really know what you're talking about. What makes you so sure that the site is serving you the same code they're promising, that they haven't installed any backdoors, or that they just plain aren't retrieving the key they generated?
@_date: 2015-07-29 12:49:24
Not only that, but he had to use his credit card to buy bitcoins to buy a gift card to buy pizza. Could have just bought pizza with the credit card much more easily.

Oh, thank you, I use Electrum with the HW1.

Oh, that sounds like great news! Were they using the recent SHA256 vulnerability to find collisions? This sounds like a fantastic idea, thank you for the explanation.

Oh, I see, thanks for the explanation.

How, when you can't buy anything from any store when using your anonymous address?
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:45:52
I'm not talking about right vs wrong. Your original comment said that tracking Bitcoin transactions is impossible, and I'm saying it's quite possible.

Yes, I made a Poromenoscoin by drawing a 1 PMC bill and gave it to a friend. That's 100% of my currency moving every day.
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:56:12
Yes, of course, because anyone pointing out glaring flaws in your viewpoint must be a troll. God forbid anyone having a different opinion.
@_date: 2017-04-11 11:55:59
Can someone summarize the current happenings for us casuals? Things move so fast and are so polarized that it's hard to keep track.
Bonus points for a "this week in bitcoin" sticky.

Fantastic, I was *just now* looking for something like that! Thanks!

Yeah, darknet markets are going to be super useful for buying toiletries... Are you people seriously not understanding this simple chain of reasoning?
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:16:21
What? I'm saying all they need to do is pass a new law mandating that retailers will have to report their transactions.

Android devices *do* have standard USB ports, they're called USB-OTG. It's a cable that plugs into your micro-USB and gives you a female USB port. You can just plug mouses, keyboards, flash disks, Ledgers, etc in it. It's a standard USB port.

So what? This pebble is worth $1000 to me, and I'll prove it by burning the money. Now what?
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:01:49
The problem is that claiming that burning money will give things value is plainly false.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:49:50
I have an HW1, is it (nowadays, latest firmware) effectively a Ledger? Whenever you say "Ledger", can I mentally substitute for "HW1", or will there always be differences between the two?
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:03:22
Didn't know they accepted Bitcoin, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:11:27
Is it? If you send any bitcoins to or receive any from an address that is not in the database, you get a fine, unless you report it right away. Retailers and other stores must report the details of anyone paying from an untracked address.
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:10:41
Unfortunately, I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain this to you. I suggest you re-read the thread from the top, maybe you'll get the point.
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:02:43
Is this because of the block size increase? No Segwit functionality has been implemented yet, right?
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:36:40
It took around half an hour for me, IIRC, but the first few confirmations came in after a minute.
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:12:05
I see, thank you. Maybe Mycelium supports it, and that's why.
@_date: 2015-04-06 08:55:26
No, but I see a fallacious generalization.
@_date: 2015-04-24 20:47:26
I got a HW1 (the grandfather of Ledger) and restored my Mycelium seed on it, so I now use that with Electrum. The only problem is that you will need to archive and unarchive the address on Mycelium from time to time, so the latter can see all the transactions you've made with the former.
@_date: 2015-04-21 05:43:21
It is, you have to travel to the other country to open an account. After that, it's easy, though.
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:31:31
So if you were allowed to carry your gun, you'd draw against the law-breaking bargoer to protect me? I kinda doubt that, so fewer guns is better, as far as I'm concerned.

If I remember correctly, the author made this at a MasterCard hackathon, and was endorsed by MasterCard, so it's not like they don't know about it.

Try Mycelium's local trader, depending on where you live you may just be able to meet up with a guy, give them $20 and get the BTC sent to your phone on the spot.

Huh, wow. That's fantastic.
@_date: 2015-02-20 00:52:58
Nope, the hosted checkout requires 2-3 lines of server-side code as well, which they omit. Still only takes two minutes, it's just not the one-line change they make it seem on the landing page.

Oh, thanks, that's pretty clever.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:08:38
Off-chain transactions with SegWit can be reversed/canceled/altered until they're on the blockchain, right? They're basically intra-exchange transactions until they've been published, or did I get this wrong?
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:46:38
Ah :/ At least it works great with my Ledger, and my funds are very secure too, since the Ledger has the keys.
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:20:16
How do you enter a PIN? I don't have a TREZOR, but I see that it only has two buttons. What's up with that?
