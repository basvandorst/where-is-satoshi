I wish I could try Breez, but my phone doesn't support it :(
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:51:52
Very nice of you to help people try out LN easily! Have an award :)
For OP: Withdraw your tip to a lightning wallet such as Breez, Wallet of satoshi or Bottlepay. It seems (from what I've read) Breez seems like the best option if it's what people say, non-custodian, while also open up channel to you? Then you can start spending on the lightning network. You can have a look at  [ to find different stores accepting lightning.
I wish there was more content creators comparing different lightning wallets for their pro's and con's. I haven't been able to find a single one for Breez or Bitcoin lightning wallet on Youtube etc.
Edit: Should of replied further down lol

They both offer 25th. I like Ledgers approach better because I only have to enter a pin that is set to that password. With Trezor I have to type it in everytime I want to access it. With Trezor one I also have to type it on my computer, meaning if someone key logs computer before they steal your seed, you're sol. The Ledger is more cumbersome if you plan on having multiple passphrases though, yet still possible.
@_date: 2019-11-03 20:09:35


Yes I know, you still have to type it everytime which is time consuming if you'd like a decently secure passphrase and for the model one you'll have to type it on your computer every time.


I think Trezor would be easier to extract data from and then your only security is a very good passphrase which can't be bruteforced easily. It's different risks for both devices imo. I'd like to see Trezor model one having ability to enter passphrase same way as one enters pin or advanced mnemonic seed check verifier or what ever it's called. With Ledger it should in theory be much harder to extract data. I like them both :)

Need btc for bisq security deposit which I guess OP doesn't have. LocalBitcoins as someone mentioned require KYC.
a) I would also suggest looking into Hodlhodl, Bisq when already having btc for security deposit.
b) Mining alts then convert
c) Play games and sell in-game item for btc
d) Selling products for btc
e) Meetups
f) Friends / family
g) /bitmarket for Paypal. Problem is you have to find someone trustworthy.
@_date: 2019-11-03 17:49:47
Ledger is easier for one passphrase and Trezor is easier for multiple.
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:05:00
I'll share my list for possible ways to acquire bitcoins since many newcomers always ask this.
a) Buying and selling bitcoin through Hodlhodl or Bisq (NO KYC/AML). You need btc for security deposit to be able to do trading and I believe this only applies to Bisq. Both Bisq and Hodlhodl are P2P.
b) Mining altcoins then converting
c) Playing games and selling in-game items &gt; btc
d) Selling products &gt; btc
e) Finding someone at a local bitcoin meetup and ask if you could buy some for cash
f) Friends / family
g) /bitmarket for Paypal etc. Problem is you have to find someone trustworthy.

No there is plenty of those. I want to know if anyone has found a good game where you can earn satoshis for playing either on mobile or computer and what their experience was like.

Lookup cost and if you can use any of these also:
Bitfinex - Should be cheap, maybe harder to verify KYC?
Hodlhodl - P2P exchange, sometimes free trades. No KYC/AML.
Bisq - P2P exchange with low fees and no KYC/AML (require already having some btc for security deposits). Little bit harder to get started with compared to centralised exchange.
Bitstamp - Available for US citizens?

I'll use my patience and wait for a good competitor that doesn't promote shitcoins. I'll rather use dirty fiat than Openbazaar tbh.

Idc what that site says. The mempool size is less than 2 MB with a total amount of tx in mempool below 4k. If you wanna pay 160 Sat/B that is your loss! The recommended fee isn't anywhere close to 160...
If you didn't know this thread is several days old and the mempool changes constantly. When this thread was made the fee wasn't anywhere close to that number and neither is it now. As OP predicted he was wrong and so are you.
@_date: 2019-04-06 02:16:30
The current fee is down to 1-2 Sat/B as of right now. Pretty fucking far from 160 don't you think?
@_date: 2019-04-05 23:32:14
Trustless lightning powered or even on-chain P2P decentralised marketplace or Ebay clone would be very interesting. I don't know how we could possibly make it more trustless than with escrow though.

This is only for cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:38:15
The fee is based on the mempool, the mempool changes constantly. Right now the fee is below 100 Sat/B.

If I want my transaction to go through in a timely fashion I know exactly where I want to set my fee.

Fee is below 20 Sat/B retard.

You could if you're in possesion of virtual goods such as csgo skins sell it for Bitcoin. Maybe there is some good Bitcoin faucet you could try to get a small amount to your wallet. Selling physical goods for Bitcoin. Easiest would be to just buy a small amount and try it out, learn about how it works, how to secure your funds etc.
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:24:29
I only know of one place as of now. It's called Openbazaar, it's a program you can download and use to sell stuff for Bitcoin. It works basically like Ebay but decentralised. 
Edit: Found one more

When you use Segwit addresses (starting with 3 or bc1) compared to legacy adresses (starting with 1) your transactions use less space and you therefore don't have to pay as much in fees. Lightning is off-chain transactions on second layer.
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:18:04
Do the seed verification test on the Ledger to ensure the seed you've written down is correct. Then wipe the device to generate a new wallet. After writing down the second newly created seed, you go and copy a new recieve adress + write it down as well, as an extra precaution. 
Back to wiping the device to enter in your first seed and be able to send to the new copied recieve adress that you've written down also. One last wiping and you can enter in your newly generated seed.
If you only have a smaller amount of funds and you're willing to take the risk of losing it, then you could import your first seed into Electrum while generating a new on the hardware. It's up to you if you're willing to risk it or not.
Edit: If you only want to check if the first generated seed is correct, and you haven't used the seed on computer, then it's enough to do one seed verification on the device.
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:30:08
Are you not using 1 Sat/B, RBF and Segwit, or did you have alot of inputs?  
My last tx had 1 input and 3 outputs from Segwit(p2sh) to Segwit bech32 and paid around $0.007 :D
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:54:53
Bitcoin is already cash and store of value (gold 2.0) so there's no need for bcash. Bcash minions want Bitcoin to not be cash so their useless shitcoin can have a use. No thanks!

According to Ledger themselves their new device is safe. It works on the condition that the bluetooth is compromised. You'll always have to confirm the transaction from the secure chip with a physical button, just like you would if it was connected to a computer through usb. This makes sense to me. 
If your computer isn't safe and you can plug a hardware wallet through usb without compromising on securing funds then why wouldn't bluetooth? They've stated that if the bluetooth is compromised an attacker could get certain kind of information, I think it was XPUB or basic transaction info such as where you send to. Also you can just turn bluetooth off, you don't have to use it if you don't want to.
This is my personal understanding of the situation. I also don't agree with either Trezor or Ledger being true "cold storage", yet as close to it you can get while still having a really good security with ease of use.

You never buy or sell Bitcoin? You don't have to daytrade to be able to use it.
@_date: 2019-01-06 12:43:11
No problems!
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:57:44
I suggest waiting for 1 confirm unless we speak redicously huge amounts. The likelyhood of someone trying to 51% attack the whole Bitcoin network just for your money isn't feasible. You can't be expecting someone to wait for 6 confirms (1 hour) for you to buy what I assume is an amount of less than $10k. 
When it has 1 confirm you know the other party isn't trying to scam you. If he/she was trying to, then wouldn't wait for it to be confirmed. The only way to scam you then would be if the block would get orphaned and that happens very rarely. More than two confirms is overkill unless you're an exchange.
If you plan on buying $10k or more in one single swoop you'll have 99% higher chance of getting robbed with a gun in my honest opinion.

FTFY :D
@_date: 2019-01-05 21:53:27
Don't do that! Generate a new wallet on hardware wallet and move funds into it ASAP. Why expose your hardware keys that's not supposed to ever leave the device? The seed isn't supposed to be stored on computer, internet, mobile. Only on your hardware wallet, on paper or stamped into metal. Otherwise there wasn't really a point in buying a hardware wallet.
If your hw-wallet was to get stolen and you're in fear of it being compromised then maybe do it, unless you have another hw-wallet that you could use.
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:52:26


It can still be a simple tool. All the wallet has to do is tell the user what the difference is between the old and new address format.


They'll probably never care to support it if the majority of users can't use it. If the business doesn't want to adapt they can leave their market share to new better actors.

If you're only trying to send ETH you should be able to do it from Ledger Live? I suspect you're trying to send erc-20 though. Make a post in r/ledgerwallet for better help.

Just send it to me and tell that crazy bitch to get fucking lost. I might just give some of it back once the time is right. If you give it all to me you can give her nothing, since you have nothing. If you don't give her money how is she gonna take your son away to another country? She probably doesn't even wanna pay for your kid anyway and since she writes her kid off like that for money, I don't think the court wants her to have custody of the kid either way.
Take everything from her and give her nothing.

Just tell me what amount you want to bet. If I show proof of ownership over $23k, what will you offer me in return? I'm not stupid enough to upload my balance of any possesion without having anything to gain from it.

Cmon then tell me how much you want to bet and we'll escrow it, the escrow (3rd party) can take 5% of winnings. I'm not showing balance of anything unless I've got something to gain.
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:25:31
7-8% fee, pretty shitty if you want my opinion. Buying on exchange for 0.25% fee is much smarter.
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:30:22
Would be stupid to quote yourself not to daytrade and call every top and bottom to make more money rather than calling the top once 
while making a small amount and after you've done so being smug enough to call everyone else who didn't sell stupid.
I've got no urge to share my buy-in or when I've sold. I don't really care for how much money you or anyone else think I've made. Bitcoin isn't only about how much fiat you've made. For me it's alot bigger than that. I don't call people stupid because they didn't buy in at the price when I did. I don't feel a need to call people stupid for not selling at the prices I do. 
I do however have a feeling you've never even been invested in the first place and decided to open your big mouth, just to get your e-penis a just a tad bigger. Big mouth should have a meeting with big dick.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:15:25
And if I show proof of more than $23k what will you offer me? I'm not showing anything until we have a bet on escrow where I gain your money :)
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:47:52
You're account is 3 months old... You think I can't move over to a new account? I've never claimed it's not possible to gain more Bitcoin by buying and selling. Why are you not doing it daily, you stoopid! 
The fact that you have a 3 month account with the need of telling everyone else you've made the right decision tells the internet more about you than about me. Since you're running out of salt you should go refuel right about now.
And since I don't have time for poor lowlife scumbags with big boy pants on, I'm leaving this conversation :)  
Have fun, I know I will.

Did you sell and buy back more of any asset? If not, then who are you to speak? You probably didn't even invest in the first place, yet you want to talk about when to sell? Hypocritical coming from someone that neither gained or lost, still considers themself to be pro trader. 
Are you selling Bitcoin now? Are you shorting Bitcoin now? Are you putting any kind of value behind your big mouth?

You'll suffer an immediate loss when you sell your Bitcoins for $. You don't realise that loss into BTC until you have to buy the same amount of Bitcoins back. $ is 99.9% certain to lose purshasing power over time while Bitcoin is very likely to gain. 
Which stock are you invested in? We can compare Bitcoin vs whatever you're invested in in two years. Lets count how many Bitcoins you've lost by not buying now vs if you had to buy in two years.
Remind me will ya?
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:10:44
Sure made alot more than you've done. 100% certain of it. Doesn't mean I have to tell other people they're stupid for not trading exactly the same as I do. 
Are you daytrading? If not, then why not? You could've sold and made so much more money if you trade everyday calling the tops and bottoms, than if you only sold and called the top once you silly cunt. Oh well guess you're stupid as fuck. Merry cuntmuch to you too you!

Well Ledger has been supporting bc32 in Electrum also for quite a while AFAIK? Trezor has not implemented bc32 in their own wallet though, which most people use. Ledger is now finally implementing it in their own wallet, Trezor should do the same ASAP.

This guy claims to be able to setup a decentralised permissionless payment system that isn't controlled by any single individual, is censorship resistant, backed by gold. My question then is, why haven't you done it?
Bitcoin is the original, it's not a fake copy, there will only ever exist one real Bitcoin. Mane fakes out there exist already, and they're dying slowly as smarter and smarter money enters the space.

You really smug for a poor boy. It's definetly not impossible to daytrade and make alot of money. That is not the same as saying, if you don't sell Bitcoin you're stupid. Which is exactly what you wrote you fucking loser. Here is your quote: "Not selling is stupid". It's pretty fucking stupid to sell low, and if you invest based on fundamentals and long term not trading then you're not stupid.
Good luck with the autistic audience. You'll attract them just as good as a pile of shit attracts flies. Nobody cares if you made $100 on selling Bitcoins. 95% of everyone else here has made alot more than you, you silly cunt.
