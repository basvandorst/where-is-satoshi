You compare Bitcoin with facebook which is stupid (Facebook is the most user friendly thing that ever existed). You should compare Bitcoin to the internet (a protocol that needs to be build upon). Now wait 24 years and see where bitcoin is.

If you look at market capacity, and potential of Bitcoin, it's still early days. Even if Bitcoin never becomes more than a niche payment method the market cap can easily expand 10 times.

My family heard of it and they all believe it is a ponzi scheme. They are those kinds of people who buy stocks at the top of a bubble because 'the stock market is doing great'. My friends and fellow students on the other hand seem to grasp the 'brilliance' of bitcoin more and more. They mostly use it to buy food at takeaway.com

But by far not as much as early adopters. That is also a property of bitcoin: rewarding early adopters so that they want to adopt early.

A few things to consider:
*A payment method can only be successful if it's used by many people. If bitcoin is used by many people, it will increase in value by design. 
* Bitcoin is still grey area. If governments make it 100% legal, it will likely increase in value. But if governments ban it, it will be around zero. This is pure speculation with potential high profit/ high loss.
* If a leak in the Bitcoin protocol is found, Bitcoin will go to zero. This isn't likely after so any years, but still a possibility.
* Bitcoin will never replace fiat. But it may challenge it. What you see as Bitcoin 'just' becoming a common currency on the internet is actually what many people see as the ultimate goal. In this scenario one bitcoin will be worth thousands of dollars.

You're wrong. Totally wrong. Deflation reduces nothing, it's simply the result of more production in relation to the total money supply. If the money supply grows faster than the production of goods/ services, money decreases in value. Central bankers (and their friends) directly influence the money supply (creating money). The only reason deflation is bad is that if you're money is worth more tomorrow you might not spend it today which makes the economy as a whole slow down. Inflation, however, is bad for people who own money and good for people who have debt (the government).

But sadly the ship has been sinking for quite a long time now. I hope you're right though.

The blockchain can be used to make something like this (freely distributable stocks?) but the power of bitcoin lies in the fact that it is backed by nothing, censored by nothing, regulated by nothing and accepted by many.

I have read news articles here in the Netherlands that businesses here are accepting Bitcoin more and more, but there are very few customers buying using Bitcoin. I think that will change once the price rises again, but it's still an issue. As long as Businesses dont calculate a part of their reduced cost into the price there is no real incentive to use Bitcoin for customers.

People with much money get even richer. That has always been true indeed. Only this time it isn't Goldman Sachs and Bill Gates who are in the 1%.

The funny part is: It doesn't matter if the user base knows nothing about economics. Most people believe 2 dollar is worth a sandwich and don't seem to understand that a dollar can become worth less and that bank-transfers cost money. What matters is that Bitcoin is growing and becomes an efficient and cheap alternative to mastercard and other payment methods.

I see a trend though, this picture looks exactly like the November '13. He just didn't see the right trend yet. The trend is a bubble followed by a long period of decline. The trend is not the period of decline itself.

I would like to point out that interest rates have never been this low in europe. This is new and risky territory. It shows the crisis isn't over yet, on the contrary. They're taking more and more extreme measures to keep the interest rates low so that deeply in debt countries can stay on board. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:30:47
I think if this slow recovery (slowly inflating, slow repayment of debt etc.) can go on for 10 years you're right. The eu wont fall apart in that case, just suffer under a load of debt for many years. But what happens if, for example, Britain leaves the EU under citizen pressure. Or Syriza becomes Greece's main party and Greece refuses to pay off any more debt? One country fucking up can disrupt the whole EU pretty much at this point.

I did that on purpose, because I think the logarithmic scale best represents Bitcoins growth trend up untill now. Im sorry if I hurt your feelings though.

In our country, many people love to complain. We will keep complaining until the weather is perfect, and when that happens we will complain the sun shines too often (literally!). Because of our negative attitude, many people now distrust the banking sector although our sector is relatively progressive, efficient and ethical. Still, we want it to be better. It's culture, I guess.

The worst scenario now is that the US will forbid Bitcoin trading too.

They completely ignore the BTC infrastructure ... In a casino your expected value is about 70%, since the casino takes about 30% of your investment. (This means that people lose 30% on average!) In BTC, the exchange takes 2% and the rest of your chance lies in improving infrastructure. Coinmap grows... Comparing BTC to gambling doesnt make sense.

I don't see how bitcoin is anyway different from fiat in the sense of: Not producing anything. As been pointed out many times, the true value of bitcoin is it's payment system, which doesn't require intermediaries to 'deliver' your money. No transaction fees, no borders, no inflation. Of course these advantages could become useless if our financial system is going to show some competence, but I personally don't see that happening anytime soon.

We went 100%up in a few weeks and 50% down in a few days, and it this moment we are again up 12% or something. Bitcoin is volatile, everyone investing should know that. That means that you can have temporary loss, but it 'might' recover in just a few weeks time. The people I really dont understand are the people buying at $1000 and then selling at $450. I just don't get that...

I researched Wikipedia and discovered that there are theories exactly believing that: "Austrian economists argue that the Great Depression was the inevitable outcome of the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve during the 1920s. In their opinion, the central bank's policy was an "easy credit policy" which led to an unsustainable credit-driven boom. In the Austrian view, the inflation of the money supply during this period led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and capital goods. By the time the Federal Reserve belatedly tightened monetary policy in 1928, it was too late to avoid a significant economic contraction.[13] Austrians argue that government intervention after the crash of 1929 delayed the market’s adjustment and made the road to complete recovery more difficult.[14]"

It's going too fast for them. They think: why can a bitcoin become worth 100 times what it was? This is a bubble! We think: Wtf a house costs 300k! giant bubble. So the difference: their bubbles grow slower and are not dividable behind the comma.

This encouragement was mostly focused on the long term. A drop of 50% percent, after such bad news, isn't strange at all. You can't blame everyone for not having foreseen China banning bitcoin, and the long-term opportunities still hold.

A tullip worth 2 bars of gold seems ridiculous. A bitcoin worth 2 bars of gold though... Why not? No one can grow a bitcoin in their garden for a few penies. Also, bitcoins don't have a lifespan of one week.

It depends, but they surely are able to crash the market. Many of these very rich people were early adopters and technically very talented people. Since the success of bitcoin is in their own interest (being in the Bill Gates rich league or being in the millions rich league), I believe this could be seen as crowdfunding the bitcoin protocol.
