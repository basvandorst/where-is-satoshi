So you transferred to your bank and your bank is freezing your money?
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:08:01
Lol, and what is that?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:29:20
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:21:38
except that's how you buy crypto, soooo..
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:07:56
This stupid mentality is what's going to bring down BTC. I hate BCH, and I don't want them to take over, but I did sell all of my BTC for other alts. The BTC programmers need to do something now or BTC will go down FAST. There's nothing that BTC does that other alts can do better, faster, cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:41:17
I believe bitcoin is doomed without LN, and it better happen FAST
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:04:56
Umm, no.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:15:12
Make sure you don't miss the litecoin wave either ;)
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:03:23
Mine arrived today and while it's weird not seeing my money on gdax and not being able to move it as I please, now I know it's actually secure.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:18:08
No, January 1st 2018

Damn, this got done faster than me switching tabs in my web browser!
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:50:53
Not if you're using limits. That's free.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:32:48
My yalls worked perfectly.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:07:23
not really
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:56:15
7889.00 right about now
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:30:34
It's actually 7600 now
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:54:05
What about LiteCoin?
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:09:36
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:40:25
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:31:28
Well, isn't it good? price went down, we can buy now, and it will go up again.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:56:28
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:04:25
Great advice right here
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:42:28
Falling? litecoin is going up like crazy, even more than BTC
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:15:27
Until it crashes. Rule  don't buy what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:28:42
Thanks guys, one more question. Do I need to have my BTC with a provider that actually supports it? Like coinbase for example. Currently I have it on an exodus wallet, but I'm unsure if they will support the new fork. Therefore, how will I know how to retrieve or where it is.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:25:22
Don't you think it will go down on the 30th?
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:36:27
Go for it then. You might even be able to pay the loan off with your bitcoin gains.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:35:58
Sucks that it is 4840 now :(
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:10:38
4780 It's going down hard.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:30:04
It took me a while to learn this. Every day is a good day to buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:55:44
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:56:34
Wow, we're hitting 4700 in about 5 minutes. Edit: nevermind, we just hit 4700
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:11:08
So is bitcoin value expected to drop? why is everyone talking about moving altcoins to bitcoin for 'free money'?
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:26:12
Ahh, that makes sense, thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:19:13
It locks in at the time you buy
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:34:40
Can you explain this a bit, let's say I have 1 Bitcoin, what should I do when the forks come? buy the new coins with that?
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:21:47
ahhahahahaha
