Fee increase only applies to Name Your Discount (avg discount ~20%). `newFee = oldFee + 0.9%`. So if the fee was 1% before, it's 1.9% now.
Buy Now (Instant &amp; Merchant) fees for Shoppers is still 0%. Merchant seller fees have not changed.

Thank you for sharing your experience. It helps us prioritize our efforts. Escrow protects users from financial loss, but annoying experiences like the one you described are too common. Based on your experience and the comments below, we're prioritizing 2 problems that are solvable.
* new Earners (or purchasers) who cancel after accepting
* support response time
Screening new users is challenging because we want users to be able to use Purse without jumping through too many verification hoops. There's way too much on-boarding friction with many Bitcoin services today, and we think it's hindering adoption. Earners who purchase then cancel are routinely reviewed, but as our support team mentioned, they're not always scammers. The solution involves better tracking of orders (last week, we integrated tracking to log the status of every shipment), analytics, and fine-tuning limits on new users.
We've recently doubled our support staff, and we have plans to increase our team even more to support our growing user base. Once our new team members up to speed, our response time should decrease dramatically.
Lastly, NYD (Name Your Discount) is one of 2 products we offer. As you mentioned, there's a tradeoff between higher discounts and friction. Buy Now, which includes Instant (5% off anything on Amazon), is a much more streamlined process.

Bank transfers only works in the US. The overwhelming majority of Turkers aren't in the US (60% in India alone), so it wouldn't work even if they're banked (unlikely). Same applies to Amazon Associates (affiliate revenue), and the dozens of services that uses AMZN gift card issuance API (eBates, Junowallet, Swagbucks, etc.).

I’m sorry you had difficulties receiving your refund from Amazon.  If you were unable to receive a refund, Purse would have covered the price of your TV with our $10,000 guarantee. 
We are very concerned about the attempt that was made to steal your identity.  When you use Purse, your address and information is not shared with the Earner.  The package is delivered to your house through the Amazon wishlist system, so your information is never shared.

Hi there.  Our average discount rate is around 25%.  Purse is a marketplace, so the discount rates go up and down...  
But I do agree with you.  Personally I was able to get 30-35% orders a few months ago, but I've definitely had to drop my discount rates lately.  I still do great, but it is more of a 20-25% discount for me.  If I don't need the item right away, I might try a higher discount for a few days, but 15-25% is usually the sweet spot.

We should have sent a notice about the change. DM us your username, and we can remove the limit for you.
Why we limit spender discounts: new users would join expecting 50% discounts because they heard it worked for someone else. The order would sit on the order book for weeks, and the user would conclude Purse doesn't work. Up to 70% of new users made this conclusion.
So we started a tiered discount system starting at 8% for Level 1, 15% for Level 2, etc. It worked well but many complained, so we got rid of it. 
As soon as removed limits, we started observing the same behavior again. We tried adding indicators that would turn red, and all sorts of other things.
Now, spenders are limited to 15% on their first Name Your Discount order. After the first purchase, there are no more limits.
We're open to suggestions on making this better. Made this information clearer on our [support page.](

So the incident blew up on Reddit 6 months ago caused by a transaction that occurred 12 months ago. Back then, Purse was a project that Kent and Andrew were working on out of an incubator.
Since then, we introduced buyer limits based on multiple levels, social authentication, fraud detection systems, improved order tracking, among countless other measures. We've also been promoting and marketing outside r/bitcoin to gift card holders like Mechanical Turks to ensure a quality buyer population. We also partnered with Unocoin and other international exchanges, and created accelerated verification systems specifically for the remittance use case, because that's where Purse really solves a problem.
We've done everything we can to make sure such an incident didn't happen again, including shutting off Germany altogether. We transacted over 30,000+ orders to date, and nothing like that has happened since. We introduced a $10,000 guarantee, and if anyone has lost BTC using Purse, we'd urge them to come forward, because to our knowledge it hasn't happened. And we're going to continue to improve to make sure the next 1,000,000 transactions are secure.
And finally, the whole ordeal turned out to be one local German police jurisdiction making a big deal because they got excited about Bitcoin. We've been told they returned everything back to the user including the Apple TV in question. has been made whole, but that statement will be better coming from him.

@_date: 2015-06-30 02:57:08
That's correct. If you're buying $100 item on Amazon for $80 in BTC, $78 in BTC gets transferred to another user when your goods arrive.
$2 goes to us, $78 goes to a user in India, Philippines, Indonesia, etc. who gets to exchange proprietary value for BTC. Some may choose to sell their BTC, and some may not. That's up to them.
If you spend $100 at most bitcoin accepting merchants, the processor sells $100 in BTC immediately to pay the merchant.
20% discount on Amazon is the historical market rate on Purse. It's no coincidence that it matches sell rates found on [gift card exchanges.]( These exchanges are less liquid and less efficient because they rely on traditional payment rails (combination of mailing checks, transferring unverified codes, PayPal). Plus, they don't work with balances stuck on Amazon accounts, which happens to be the way Mechanical Turks and other independent contractors are paid.

They vary a bit depending on the shipping speed. Most orders take about 2-3 working days since Amazon provides 2 day shipping. Occasionally, some orders take a long time to ship (up to 2 weeks.)

It's the main reasons we chose Amazon. They are fantastic at taking care of returns. As a gift recipient, you can return or exchange items just like you would any order on Amazon.

So we were attributing a surge of traffic today to a [new feature]( that we launched yesterday. This explains much better. Joining late to the party...
There are many reasons we chose to integrate with Amazon, and one of them is the fact that they have a state-of-the-art fraud detection system and a strong anti-chargeback process. 
The fraud/scam vector that's described by speculators in this thread is not new to Amazon. For example, fraudsters with stolen credit cards could purchase [gold bars]( and skip Bitcoin altogether. Amazon is the best in the world at countering this stuff.
Our job is to guarantee the safety of our users. If you spend BTC, you have to release BTC from escrow by confirming delivery of your items. If you buy BTC, our system detects status of your order from purchase, shipment, to delivery. And yes, we do collect information and ban BTC Buyers who consistently have their orders canceled on Amazon (indication of fraud). Regardless, Spenders' BTC are not at risk on our marketplace.
On Purse, the discount for the BTC Spender translates to a premium for the BTC Buyer. Historically, this rate hovered around 13-15%. It is a market rate determined by the BTC Spender through a [reverse auction]( From a US/Europe centric perspective, it's hard to explain why anyone would pay such a premium. But consider that (a) Purse users come from 90+ countries including places without an exchange (b) Purse provides a way to liquidate Amazon credit and gift cards for BTC. [Mechanical turks]( are paid in Amazon credit, but most "turks" live in countries without a Amazon site.
Having said that, we think the discount/premium should be lower. Somewhere around 7-10% seems more reasonable. To encourage BTC Spenders to input a lower discount, we announced a Guarantee Program. If Spenders input a discount &lt;10%, we will match the order with vetted Buyers. Purse guarantees that the order will be taken in 24 hours, or we'll take ourselves (only for US site). 
"BTC Spender" or "Spender" = user with BTC spending on Amazon. "BTC Buyer" "Buyer" = user with Amazon credit or credit card purchasing on behalf of the Spender.

Customer service is a top priority here at PurseIO, so no one gets ignored.

Agreed, I intentionally added the "Incentive matters" but guess it wasn't clear enough. 
Our mission here at PurseIO is to provide a REAL economic incentive to spend bitcoins. 
The side benefit is that the BTC goes to someone who really want's it, and have no other good way of buying BTC. Many buyers are from countries without easy access to exchanges. Most B2C merchants to accept BTC simply creates a sell order on the market to existing bitcoin users or large private investors.

The Purse discount is market determined through a reverse auction where BTC Spenders set discount rates and BTC Buyers are given the option to fulfill them. Many factors determine the discount including your location, price of the item, time of day, etc. Historically, the average discount for successful transactions has hovered between 10-25%. For more on the discount, check out this [blog article]( 
BTC Buyers pay a premium for the convenience and the ability to liquidate Amazon gift cards. There are 3x more Amazon gift cards and balances in value than Bitcoin, even though they are much less liquid. For more on this issue, check out this [article](

No. The primary use case for wish lists is wedding registries. Would you get in trouble if you received a wedding gift from someone who used a stolen credit card? The fraudster is the person who used the stolen credit card to purchase the item on Amazon, NOT the gift recipient. Also, Amazon is good at detecting fraud and rejecting transactions.

We are different in the following ways:
1. We leverage Amazon wishlists to protect personal information/address of our users.
2. Our system is automated, and do not rely on users honestly submitting correct prices. 
3. BTC Buyers do not have to be verified before purchasing.
4. We offer a free market where BTC spenders set their own discounts, while Brawker has a static 8% savings.

The only party that knows the shipping address besides the Spender (you) is Amazon. Purse and the BTC Buyers do not have that information. We're more private than eBay.
The name is pseudonymous (you can change the name on your Amazon account at will).
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:13:08
The BTC buyer premium is determined by the market (of BTC spenders). Currently, it's on the high side, but time will tell what it ends up being. As a BTC buying platform, we do not compete with coinbase. It's a very different demographic that uses PurseIO.

Depends on many factors including: size of order, type of order, country of purchase, country of delivery, etc. Amazon history of the BTC Buyer (the one paying Amazon) also plays into the equation. For more info, please email us.

Starting with an apology to the OP for the nightmare he’s going through. We have been in touch since he started receiving inquiries from the German authorities a month ago. Upon confirming details of the investigation, we assisted OP in providing data about the counterparties for his transactions. Additionally, we offered to get in touch with the authorities directly to assist in determining what happened.
From this post, we learned of the escalations taken by the German police to investigate a gift recipient (OP), and not the user who paid Amazon. We emailed the OP and offered help and reimbursement for legal expenses.
In response to comments in this thread about the credit card fraud vector, I’d like to share some data points about this case as well as the whole picture.
* In the OP’s case, we have reason to believe the counterparty’s activity came from a hacked computer of another German victim (we have their name, IP, email, device ID, etc.). The hacker had complete control of the victim’s computer including email, credit card details, and Amazon account. The larger investigation is likely about the entire damage to this victim’s identity and compromised financial accounts. The ~$50 transaction for an AppleTV on Purse was likely the least of this victim's damages or this hacker’s gains.
* Every payment system and commerce platform is subject to abuse by fraudulent users. That goes for Amazon, eBay, Visa, wires, PayPal, Bitcoin, Rakuten, Coinbase, and Purse. People have and will continue to abuse these systems, and it’s our collective responsibility to detect, prevent, and investigate fraudulent activity.
* When investigating fraudulent activity, we think it’s best to look at the data to determine what happened to identify the criminals. We provided quite a bit of evidence that should point authorities in the right direction and conclude that the OP is innocent. 
* At a glance, it’s easy to conclude no one would be crazy enough to pay 5-35% premiums to purchase bitcoin. It’s not an easy concept for Westerners to grasp. But consider the following: (1) The Amazon virtual currency ecosystem is 3-4x larger than Bitcoin. (2) Of the $15B in Amazon gift cards and gift card balances outstanding, a huge chunk of it exist in developing countries. (3) 70% of Mechanical Turk workers live in India, Indonesia, Philippines, and other developing countries. They have two options to get paid: USD check in the mail that takes 2 months to deliver or instant Amazon US gift card balance. (4) Programs like Amazon affiliate and other 3rd party programs accentuate this.
* Over 75% of Purse's buying volume come from users who liquidate Amazon gift card balances. Gift card balances, unlike bitcoins, are non-transferrable and only works in one country. If you live in India, that means you pool together your friends to purchase stuff on Amazon and pay $70 shipping to get to liquidity.

Right now, we have more BTC Buyers then Spenders, so it's definitely a spender's market. BTC availability varies between places, and some of our customers come from the middle east, where PurseIO may be the only option. 
As a BTC spender on PurseIO, not only do you receive a discount, but you know your BTC goes to the hands of someone who's really going to appreciate it.

Deeply moved by Purse users coming to our defense. We are working on  improving customer service. Here's what's going on.
Over the past 5 months, activity on our site grew roughly 100x. One of the interesting patterns we noticed was buyers attempting to purchase orders then canceling on a consistent basis. While we don't explicitly prohibit this type of behavior, we suspect it could be a sign of fraudulent activity. At the very least, it creates a negative experience for Spenders and raises the risk profile for that user.
In order to provide a safe and secure environment, we implemented various fraud detection methods and continuously working on improving them further. (Bitcoiners interested in working on machine learning algorithms or building distributed systems should contact us.)
This OP's activity was flagged for various reasons. First, the OP canceled orders 2 orders on Purse. So we locked his account for 1 day. After receiving his explanation, we reinstated the account. For the next 7 days, he complained about being locked out. Turns out, he was using a different email address and couldn't login to that one (confirmed through a screenshot he sent us). The other login was also locked out of was also flagged for cancellations. 
Lastly, this user creates a Reddit account solely for the purpose of trolling Purse. If this isn't suspicious behavior, I don't know what is.

Thanks for asking! 
If Amazon ships your item, you can easily refund through Amazon's gift return service by using the Amazon OrderID. You will receive Amazon gift card credit in return. Purse nor the Buyer needs to be involved.
If a 3rd party supplier ships your item, it depends on the supplier's refund policies although Amazon is streamlining all marketplace suppliers refund policies and processes. For issues related warranties and defective items, we suggest contacting the original manufacturer. As always, our support team is ready to help you.

Just updated our [home page]( When you log in, you'll notice a "Sell" button to list items for sale.
Before today, Purse had 250 Million SKUs available for purchase with Bitcoin at a better price than with fiat. With the launch of Merchants, we carry more SKUs than any other marketplace in the world including amazing products like [Windcatcher](
It's hard to argue Bitcoin isn't a useful payment mechanism when virtually every product is now available at a better value than any fiat marketplace. Sell your products today on the world's largest marketplace!

I think you're right on.  Around $100-$200 with a 20-25% discount goes pretty fast.  Agreed on the &gt;$35 for free shipping as many purchasers don't have Prime shipping yet.... though after Prime day there's probably many more out there... :) 
@_date: 2015-08-07 22:05:04

This isn't intentional. Sales tax is one of the most difficult things to assess for ecommerce platforms. No joke, there are [10,000]( different sales jurisdictions in the US. Our job is harder because we're trying to guess Amazon's policy, which varies depending on whether a 3rd party seller has a distribution center in the state where you're shipping to. Anyway, the combinations are ridiculously high.
For Instant, if there's a discrepancy for sales tax, simply make leave a message in the order, and we'll issue a refund before you even get the item delivered. Tricking users with sales tax is not part of our business model. Hope this helps.

Yes, but it depends on how quickly deals expire. Our suggestion is to use Name Your Discount at a 10% discount rate. Save 10% in addition to Prime Day sales by spending cryptocurrencies.

Thanks for trying! We limit because we had users shoot for 40%+ on their 1st order, complain when nobody takes the order, and conclude Purse doesn't work.
So we limit first time Shoppers to 15%, but you can increase to 20% instantly by linking your Coinbase account. The limit goes away after the first order.

In the original decentralized model, where "buyers" purchase items for "spenders", the vast majority (~80%) of the orders are fulfilled through gift cards.
With "Purse Instant", the company is sourcing gift cards and fulfilling orders themselves thereby guaranteeing absence of credit cards from the transaction.
We aren't sure if 5-8% discounts are enticing enough when our users are used to 25% discounts, but we'll see. It is in beta and not all users have access.

Issue has now been resolved. This was an error on the Amazon side that affected wishlists created between March 31st - April 6th. 
To fix, cancel/delete wishlist. Create new wishlist and import into Purse.
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:29:43
I don't mean to derail the conversation, but the concept of a fixed discount is slightly misleading. Historically, the average discount is 20%, but there are orders between 1-35% discounts that get filled daily. 1% discounts implies the best deal on the market. You could buy a gift card from Gyft at 3% off and arbitrage. Not only that, you'd get bitcoins in 1-2 days if you have Prime. That's unbeatable. 
Further, cash to BTC is ridiculously expensive on local bitcoin. You can buy gift cards with cash at Walgreens and convert to bitcoins at Purse. Bitcoin for the unbanked.
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:32:44
**Basic Instructions:**
1. Tell us what you want from Amazon (as specific as possible, preferably a URL to the item). 
1. Your name and shipping address, along with preferred shipping speed.
1. We’ll give you the total to confirm, with a bitcoin address.
1. Pay the amount (-5%), and you order will be on its way!

Purse.io is a marketplace that matches Amazon shoppers with unused gift card inventory. 
The platform provides the only means to liquidate Amazon gift card balances. Each gift card liquidation is matched with someone who wants to save on Amazon.
If you shop on Amazon, have access to Coinbase/Circle, and want to save, it's a good fit for you.

@_date: 2015-04-07 14:12:30
Thanks for using Purse! Intuitively, $100 in bitcoin ≠ $100 Amazon GC ≠ $100 GC balance on an Amazon account. We allow users to set any discount, and the market determines whether it gets filled. 
Amazon and a dozen other companies issue gift card balances as payment, especially overseas. MTurk, swagbucks, ebates, junowallet, coinstar - just a handful of examples that issue Amazon gift cards instead of real currency. For more, check out our latest [blog]( 
For us, it's harder to imagine why anyone would pay face value for a gift card when the market value is far less.

Instant orders are free because we're taking the spread between cost of gift card and discount offered to users. We charge a fee to spenders (the user receiving a discount). For 20% discounts on the marketplace, the fee is 1.9%. All in all, it's a great deal for both sides of the marketplace.
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:34:55

So we looked through our records and found the only recent $11 Amazon Basics keyboard purchase (assuming that's you). There wasn't any mistake with the order. What likely happened was that you didn't realize that the escrow was refunded to you when it was canceled, and credited towards your next purchase.

Boom. +10% to your net worth. $20 @_date: 2015-04-08 01:44:28
Even in our wildest imaginations, we did not see this as a possibility. We responded with a $10,000 guarantee, covered all costs, and made numerous changes (Purse Instant pilot included).
Purse is arguably the largest legal Bitcoin marketplace. We sell more products on a monthly basis than Overstock sells in bitcoin. It's not because we are the best marketers, it's because we have the best prices, provide access to the largest inventory of products, and most importantly, provide the only way to liquidate Amazon gift card balances using Bitcoin.
As such, we hope this community views this incident as a small hiccup in a long journey to drive mainstream Bitcoin adoption.

Thanks! To be perfectly honest, we're not sure if (a) people will use it and (b) if we can handle volume at 8% discounts. 
But given size of Amazon gift card market, there will be a discount rate X where users are willing to part with bitcoins AND gift card holders/issuers will be willing to sell. As a marketplace, our job is help coordinate a price where it makes sense, in addition to providing a seamless, secure experience.
This is a beta feature and subject to fine-tuning.

Generally, price discrepancies occur due to vendor selection or sales tax. 
* Name Your Discount: Amazon's algorithm selects the vendor from the wishlist, and it's not always based on lowest price. Other factors include vendor rating, quantity available, and shipping. Note: used items aren't supported.
* Instant (add to cart): If we overestimate sales tax, we'll automatically refund the difference to you upon purchase.

When we first noticed packages being sent to shipping forwarders, we assumed privacy conscious shoppers. After talking to our top customers, we learned that the vast majority of these orders were being shipped internationally to countries including Venezuela, Singapore, Canada, and the Philippines.
Consider that a box of Minecraft Legos that sells for $13.29 on [Purse Buy Now]( goes for $40 (55 SGD) on [Lazada]( in Singapore. American goods are very popular overseas, and they sell for insane premiums.
We estimate over 10% of our volume on Amazon.com actually ends up getting shipped internationally. After evaluating all the shipping forwarders, we found USendHome to be a clear winner and convinced them to accept Bitcoin. We built a seamless integration - shoppers can generate a US address with 1 click. They will notified of delivery and receive a picture of the delivery so they can release escrow. USendHome consolidate packages to minimize shipping costs and take care of customs. 
At Purse, we're committed to flattening the world with Bitcoin.

Just to set terminology, our marketplace consists of Shoppers, Earners, and Merchants. Shoppers (like OP) spend bitcoins in exchange for products, Earners exchange gift cards for bitcoins (OP is calling them sellers), and Merchants sell goods for bitcoins.
We DM'ed OP for more info, but from what we can tell so far, an Earner left a message saying his/her Amazon account was locked out. Reasons may vary why an Earner's Amazon account gets locked out, and we're usually not privy to that information.
With Instant, we are the largest Earner on the marketplace, and our accounts don't get locked out. If it's happening to others, it's likely because Amazon is more suspicious of non-US IPs, activity that looks like drop shipping, or accounts that lack credit card / address verification.
We're keeping an eye on this, but this issue is not systemic, and it does NOT affect Shoppers or Merchants.
