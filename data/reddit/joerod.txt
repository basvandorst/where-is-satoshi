I wish they had a bitcoin ATM there or an exchange would make that place a lot more desirable to go to.

its happening!!!

I've had good experience with Coinbase, but I do wish there was some competition.  The only way for bitcoin to really take off is if its easy to get coins, IE my parents can get coins.

what is their fee and how long does it take to get the $?

I'd be all for this, I play fantasy football and my league we play for money and have weekly payouts.  Its sometimes difficult for the person holding the money to pay out.  Bitcoin could help with this.  Only issue is most friends I play with are not very technical, don't know how to get bitcoin ect.  I still thing this would be a really cool project.

I encrypt my wallet and put it in the cloud. Should I not be doing this?
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:48:12
does this mean there will be a spike in BTC value?
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:33:28
I'm sure there will be institutions lending bitcoin for interest. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:45:37
I don't think so.  If the rules ever change you can publish to the Apple app store.
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:40:55
Coinbase should have this feature built in.

but tigerdirect GPU minning is better for litecoins not bitcoin

put your app on Cydia, iOS7 is now jailbroken so you should be able to make some money
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:05:55
I'd use bitcoins more if more places accepted it. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:32:27
Bottom line is Apple cannot make any money from bitcoin and with paypal they can get a kick back.  Once bitcoin becomes to hard to avoid Apple will implement it.

Great thank you!

I'm currently using deepbit, I think I'll give some others a try.

If it takes 8 min or so to verify a transaction how will bitcoin work if mom and pop shops start accepting bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:36:37
why are you hating and not embracing, is the current system that much better?
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:44:36
Wouldn't bitcoin take away from eBay's other company Paypal?
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:14:40
I had the same problem, if you recently moved use your old address.  I did that and was finally verified. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:10:24
How does this work for a merchant?  They're not going to expect a person to wait 8+ minutes before they can buy something?
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:43:52
I love the idea and I love that your from my home town but "BTCPROMO" did not work for me and you don't accept bitcoin as payment :-(
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:41:03
thanks for the sarcasm, zero confirmations means you can potentially get ripped off?

Do I need an invite for ghash.io ?

I think if it easier to purchase (exchange) bitcoins people would be more inclined to use them.  I'd love to start using them but I have to wait a week to exchange.  localbitcoin is cool but take a lot of effort to go to a bank and make a deposit.
