I think that's exactly what it was supposed to be. There is a thing called standarddeviation which isn't shown on the graph. It's just to show the rough area in which bitcoin will be moving in. Expecting anything else would mean you also believe in fortune tellers.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:41:43
Buy high, sell low, you're doing everything right.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:05:32
Because you wouldn't have bought back then. The thing is, bitcoin can raise up to a million in the next 10-20 years. You won't believe me now and therefor you won't put money into it. Back then was the exact same thing, no one who didn't really understand what Bitcoin is would believe that it'll reach 15k one day and surely not within a year, so everyone said that the price is to high already and wouldn't buy. That same thing is repeating right now and in 10 years people will complain how they didn't buy when btc was at 15k. You just think that you would have bought because now you already know it would have reached 17k. You just have to accept that you would have done back then the same that you are doing now. Have you put anything into bitcoin now? No? Then don't be mad, you wouldn't have invested back then either. If you have now then congrats, you might reap a fortune in 10-20 years if you have the patience and mindset not to sell when the price doubles.

Sorry, i don't do such analyses, i was just trying to state the obvious. Maybe he even uses self made ones, but there are dozen's of similar graphics, so there must be libraries that you just use on the extracted blockchain data. Google for "d3.js tree diagram" for example, that seems to be a common one that you could use. You need some programming skills of course.

Thanks for this comment, i just realized that as time goes buy, more and more bitcoins will be lost because of people dying or just losing them. This is good for Bitcoin.

Told them already, but they're just thinking i'm making jokes because they can't imagine that someone who found out about them that early would have already sold them when they hit 1k. I hope they'll sooner or later notice that someone with that much money wouldn't keep working here.

You should say you'll average them up then.

You can use tools to watch coin movements on addresses and also use a tool to do the analysis. If it's a hobby of him, that's not really much work for him. New account is for security/anonymity reasons, so nothing really shady here imo.

There is still the slight chance of the database beeing deleted/destroyed or whatever, in that case you'd lose all your coins or would you be able to still get access to your coins with key 2 and key 3? And if so, how would you do it? Since it seems to be an integrated part in the bitcoin-protocoll i guess you wouldn't need bitgo at all in that case?

That's what i expect, too. In the long run it will be like with brands today, most will stick to bitcoin, but others will choose some altcoin that also has a big network because they can relate to it more. It's the same as witch cars, clothes etc. There is not a single part of humanity where someone has a monopoly on sth.

How are the devs beeing paid if there are no fees involved? Wouldn't it be better to have low fees that go into some kind of pool and get distributed by the work the devs put into the code? There surely will have to be some constant updates to the software and the devs could vote who gets how much based by the quality of their work.
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:59:07
Do you also know the reason for that? I'd think that he would be the one who knew best where bitcoin could end if it got accepted, and therefor would be mining as much as he could.

I've often read that about less volatility once adopted, but i don't really get why that will be. Sure, whales who don't hold any, won't make big dents with their 1-3m$ when trying to move the market, but what about those who are holding 10.000 and more btc? It doesn't matter how evolved btc is, using that many coins will always shatter the market because they would then move billions and trillions of dollars.

I think thats only the number of hydrogen atoms aka atoms in stars. With the atoms of the planets combined it seems to tend to be between 10^85 and 10^88 or ~2^290.
Should we ever find out that dark matter is made out of atoms, too, this would increase greatly and i also wonder how black holes should be counted into that.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:11:16
Number of atoms in the earth seems to be close to 2^160 which is the number of public addresses, not private

You should know that whoever Satoshi Nakamoto is, he hasn't spent a single bitcoin so far and most of the really early adopters probably sold most of their coins when they reached 1$ or lost them since they didn't care much after mining some at the beginning. Of course there are many that did and still do hold their stash and became millionnaires by now, but for the very first 15.000 blocks or so, not a single coin has been spent, which you can prove by checking the blockchain.

There are enough rich people who would buy enough bitcoins back for such a low price which would drive it back up. If there are no bad news coupled with such a sell off, i don't see how the price would touch 200$, let alone stay at that level.
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:42:53
I guess you're right, especially on the internet where you can't even be sure of someone being native or not.

I might not be an early early adopter, but somehow i managed to buy at the right times. Heard of them around june 2013 and bought some while the price was falling at ~120$-90$. Tried to arbitrage between mt.gox and bitstamp and was wondering why nobody else was doing it until i found out when i tried to get the money out of gox. Panic-sold many when the silkroad-crash happened and had to rebuy at a higher price. Since i thought i had learned enough about it and was confident that the price would quadruple when the winklevoss-etf comes out, i took a big loan from the bank on 17. Oct 2013, right when the rally started. Payed back the loan on Nov. 22. with a big smile on the face when i went to the bank because they knew what i had taken the loan for. 
I kept the rest of the coins, lost some with gambling and altcoin-investments but still had enough to be comfortable with. Then i decided to take another smaller loan because i expect another bubble when wallstreet joins in on july. I got the money on May 20., again right before the rally started.
So even if i'm not really an early adopter (although i think we all still are), i managed to buy in on the best possible moments, which feels pretty good. :)
My main motivation was that i would handle a loss way better than knowing that if bitcoin really hits the moon, that i had the chance to act but was not brave enough to do so.
Oh and ofc i'm not just sitting on them but trying to spend them whenever i have the chance to.

Please send your belongings to this account and await for further instructions.

There is no effect in double spending then. Sooner or later only one of the transactions will be seen as legitimate, so the usual goal of a double spend is to receive sth. for a transaction that will be counted as false, so that you receive sth. but don't lose the spent coins. For the other transaction you would receive sth. different or send them to yourself. 
So sending both transactions to yourself would make no sense at all because you don't get money or some service that you would keep and have the spent coins for that beeing reverted.

Yes, because you now decide how and how well you want to protect your keys.

Exactly, it surely is safer to make a new email-adress for every site, but that's what maybe 0.002% of the people are doing whilst he acts as if that is what everyone is supposed to do. You can use different account names for different sites and of course different passwords, but creating a new email-address?

Although using different bitcoin addresses would be recommended, it really only makes sense if you want to disguise your trails.

Not exactly, you are estimating that every possible combination is a valid key, which isn't right. This site here:  has all private keys with 9,046x10^74 sites and 128 keys per site, which is 1,1578x10^77 possible keys. Still makes it pretty much impossible to generate a key twice.

You don't need the app for that, but imagine you're participating as a secret santa and want to surprise your donee who is living aboard and is into hiking or cryptocurrencies. That would be a great way to do it.

I could imagine you would follow some drivers in your area and the insurance would be the "upvotes" (if that's possible in there) or number of followers that driver has. More of them means the driver is doing his job well, which would help new ones to choose the right driver. But all in all that type of offers can't really compete with an coordinated service i think.
@_date: 2016-01-22 22:00:18
Of course not, but why make it easier for spoofers to exploit his system by telling them how he does it? It's a first step and i'm sure he would appreciate hints on how to improve that if you have some for him. I'm playing Ingress, which belonged to google, and even they don't have a solution to stop all spoofers, so i won't expect a single guy to be able to find a perfect method.

You forget one important thing though, without the internet all the knowledge of how to operate certain important things is gone. You lose the community-effect that bitcoin depends on and everyone would only trade locally, not globally. Try it for yourself: grab a radio and try to transmit some bitcoins without looking up anything online about how to modify the radio to transmit information instead of receiving it etc. and don't forget to grab your printed copy of the bitcoin-protocol. 
If all the knowledge is gone, you basicaly start from scratch and that means it'll take some centuries to get back to todays technology, depending on how big the doomsday event was.

How do you get to 10k? Previous bubbles mostly got to 4-6x of its starting value and this run started at around 800, so i'd say 5k might be the top.

Gold mining difficulty is increasing, too though, because you have to dig deeper and deeper to find some, which leads to higher costs. It just increases at an slower pace than bitcoin. The difference is, that gold miners don't get any transaction fees, so once it's getting to a point, where it's impossible to go deeper or extract it from water, gold mining would have to stop or maybe move to asteroid mining.

I told a guy from work that i found out about bitcoin when they were at 300. He immediately grabbed his head and said: "Whaaat, you own 300 bitcoins??" i just went with it and now everyone here thinks i'm a multimillionaire and is beeing nice and all that.

I'm more worried about how to move all those millions of fiat once the fees get to that level.

Better sell at Kraken for 13.567bill.

Maybe a few thousand coins which you would have sold for a few hundred bucks once btc reached 10 cents.
@_date: 2015-04-18 10:46:07
You can also simply convert the binary to its decimal number, open a text editor and then press alt + the number (on the keypad) and you'll get the apropriate letter.
01000010 = 66
alt + 66 = B

Well, we could use her at the same time, i don't mind that. You guys don't seem to grasp the concept of intellectual property though, it's time that people invested which they need to be paid for. If everyone would be pirating, no one would make films anymore and thus you are destroying future bits and bytes. We can argue about the price of course, some of them are getting to much, but that is part of the risc factor. You can either work for a fixed hourly price and be fine with it or doing something risky where you could loose money or having luck and get more out of it.
I'm blaming the film and music industry for this situation though, they have the option to come up with a good system where you could pay a reasonable amount for streaming per film, but all the services i know want you to pay a subscription which many aren't keen to. I hope this will change with bitcoin where you could pay per minute of watching a film, so you could stop after 10 minutes when you realize that it's garbage.
@_date: 2015-09-06 19:56:32
It's not like they just magically make $1000+ out of my $100. If the RRR is at 10% they can theoretically even only make $899.99 from them, which is highly unlikely because they'd have to loan it out consecutively 71 times. 
Anyway, i don't get why you seem so angry. It's not like fractional reserve banking is the root of all evil. It gives you the option to work with the money instead of having it just laying there uselessly. It just has to be monitored and controlled which isn't happening atm but would be possible by anyone if we'd use a blockchain.
@_date: 2015-09-05 17:13:06
You still don't seem to get it. Imagine you are the bank and i give you my $100. As you wished, fractional reserve lending is forbidden, which means you have to keep all 100$ ready all the time for me so i can withdraw them when i need them. What are you doing now to make a living? You can't do anything, you are just holding my money for me, doing the processing, having it insured for me without any benefit for you. And remember, i want some interest from you or else i'll put my money elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-09-05 21:53:05
I checked the [wiki article on 100% reserve banking]( to see if i missed something, but nope: *Full-reserve banking, also known as 100% reserve banking, refers to an alternative to fractional reserve banking in which banks are required to keep the full amount of each depositor's funds in cash, ready for immediate withdrawal on demand.*
The way it worked in the past though is because they differentiated between demand deposit accounts (such as checking accounts) which could not be loaned out and time deposit accounts where you get an interest over a period of time but where you don't have access to the funds in that time period. The money in latter accounts could be lent out. 
In that way it makes perfect sense, that's right.
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:09:09
That makes no sense. 100% reserve means that everyone can come in at once and receive their complete deposit. This is not possible anymore if you lend someone even $1.
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:27:53
Agreeing on the control thing, but shouldn't the required reserve ratio also be way higher than those 1-10% most countries have? But i guess those in power just like to take the most out of it.

Those transactions that don't fit into a block, will be put into the next one. If that one is full, too, they will try to fit into the next one and so on. With many transactions all blocks will be full and some transactions will have to wait forever.

We don't pay VAT on bitcoin.de though because we're buying directly from other people there, right? I can't really find an example where this would be applicable. I mean if i buy clothes for cash, i have to pay the 19% VAT and i guess if i would buy them with bitcoin, i'd still have to pay it, so do you know where this actually makes a difference now?

Not really, if he would have bought that same amount on the free market at once, he would have paid much more. Those that aim for holding, will bid a premium on such auctions and outbid those that want to sell them right away.

Someone mentioned that sidechains can't solve the 7 TPS-problem because you still need to make a transaction to the sidechain and another one back to the main blockchain, which in fact would make it even worse. I don't understand the side-chain principle that well, has that been addressed, or does it work differently so that it's not a problem at all?

I like the comment of StewartJ in there: "I am in the same boat. Try to follow the smarties in here for their recommendations, but the bottom line is I think **I secretly wish for $1 btc, then I will go in big and long.**"
The same guy 3 years later: "UPDATE!
Arranged some BTC, now need only 10 Bitcoins to reach the 30 BTC milestone."
I guess he should have taken them at those 2$ back then.

None seem as trustworthy as jd though. The only thing that bugs me is, that clam aren't used anywhere else, so in case doog decides to shut it down again, there will be a massive bank run and mostly everyone will take a big loss.

That would be a centibitcoin. We already have bits, so a centibit would be 1 Satoshi.

A genius like satoshi might have written this in advance to cover his identity, but he wouldn't come years later and try to tell everyone that he is satoshi. On the other hand... maybe that's part of his plan, too. Act like an idiot so people won't believe it's you.
