Yes you need to get verified to get coins off gox which takes weeks / months.

You'll buy a bitcoin and then claim you never got anything and do a chargeback. Then the person that gave you the bitcoin just got screwed out of $66. Best stick to depositing cash at a bank on Monday.

Bitcoin is a strange thing. It goes up to $260 and then down to $55 and now at $100. It has been in the news a lot and I'm sure more people want to check it out. I'm guessing more money will be coming in next week so it may go up. I say hang on to it. If it starts going down buy something with it. If it goes up a lot buy something with it. 
@_date: 2013-02-27 08:07:16
Buy some now. Sucks if you wait and in a couple weeks it is at $40. Think of all the money you could have made.

@_date: 2013-04-19 04:21:55
A market you can buy and sell bitcoins instantly. With coinbase you get locked into a price say right now you buy 20 bitcoins at $115. Because it will take so long for the bank to send the money to coinbase they won't deliver your bitcoins till Wednesday. If you order on a Sunday / Monday you will wait the fewest days for your bitcoin. If you sell it on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday you'll get your bitcoins in your bank account in 2 days.
Coinbase is good for buying bitcoins and moving them to mtgox and then buy and sell if you want. Otherwise if you just hold / use them move them to your favorite wallet.

Someone moved thousands of bitcoins from 1 address to another so this web site shows the transaction in the form of a bubble.
@_date: 2013-03-12 00:37:17
It is high but if you wait and it goes up more then you can't buy as many. Then in the future you will be saying, "If I bought earlier I could have $50,000 more."
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:14:28
I'm sure the government wants 40% of the money. Taxing us like we're the 1%
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:09:02
I would. If you want to invest that means there are thousands others that want to. There are only so many bitcoins to go around so if you want a bigger slice of the bitcoins you better buy in now. If you put in $7500 into bitcoins right now then every dollar increase = $100. If 1 bitcoin = $100 then you are up $2500. There is no telling how high this can go.
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:19:44
Yeah. People always like to divide things by 21 million of 11 million. Really it is a lot lower.

You may or may not be buying at the high of the curve. There are thousands of people looking to buy bitcoins (MtGox verify line, coinbase not having enough bitcoins) and more new people finding out about bitcoins everyday.

i cant believe it. you cant do much with litecoins and i'm waiting for some noob to try and cash out $100k and crash litecoins.
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:41:03
It is really tough. We just watched it go from $50 to $150. Now the question is will there be another couple million put into bitcoin to get us close to $170? 
Or will people stop investing, people get tried of waiting for the price to go up and cash out their 5,000-10,000 bitcoins and take their money and run. Then the price goes down to $140, $130, $120. Then do we start going back up. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:30:31
localbitcoins.com I saw someone in my area like 30 cents over the current rate. Factor in gas money though. Most places are around 5% though.

@_date: 2013-03-21 17:46:43
Yes you should have waited. If a couple people bought thousands to jack the price up there will be more people that will want to buy thousands.

@_date: 2013-04-16 04:24:46
Over draft. You could call your bank and tell them to block all ACH withdrawals from your account. Then when coinbase tries to take the money it'll be rejected. Not sure what happens then. Maybe they give up and keep the bitcoins and that's that. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:01:54








@_date: 2013-03-12 00:31:28
Then the coins are lost forever (unless they put instructions in the will). Just means the remaining coins will be worth more. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:51:18
1 person is bringing the price up and down and just collecting bitcoins. I'm sure they have almost 100,000 bitcoins and a ton of money just messing with us. They will end up bringing the price back up and being the richest bitcoin person ever.
@_date: 2013-03-16 23:51:48
You feel pretty shitty doing that and losing 9 times in a row. All my money is gone :(
Good thing it was play money though. I'll keep telling myself to save my bitcoins.

I heard people are getting verified quickly too. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:15:29
Someone dumped a lot of coins and brought the price down from $75 to $65 (I sold) and then down to $53. It bounced back to $75 today. If I never sold I would have $400 more today. Basically you buy and hold because it seems to always recover now. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:01:33
They are legit. I've sold 150+ bitcoins and get my money in 2 days. I've bought 150+ bitcoins and gotten them all @ a locked in price. You probably shouldn't use coinbase as a market. Buy bitcoins and move them to mt.gox if you feel like selling during a dump. I've had to wait anywhere from 3-6 days to get my bitcoins but usually the price has gone up so it's like I'm already ahead. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:20:36
8 days later it happened. $49 earlier today and then fell to $33ish.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:23:05

It takes awhile for them to take the money from your bank account.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:37:46
Yeah, we are hoping the price will go up into the thousands as adoption grows. How quickly that will happen we don't know. For all we know someone could sell thousands of their bitcoins and the price could be $50 by the end of the day and $10 by the end of the week. On the flip side someone right now could be wiring millions over and the price will shoot up $50. I would hold off for now and see where the price is in a week.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:58:16
right now there are 11 million bitcoins or so. probably thousands lost. millions being saved. together we can jack the price up and buy things using bitspend. dont cash out people.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:39:08
People need to buy and save. If you want to sell because you need to buy something then use the bitcoins to buy Amazon gift cards and buy what you need off Amazon. If it isn't on Amazon then find another site that will order what you need and you buy in bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:27:38
People should put money into bitcoin and hold. Then buy stuff with bitcoin. Not put millions in and then take millions out and bring the market down with you.
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:44:33
People are getting smarter. If you don't do a market sell the price goes up!
@_date: 2013-03-20 08:39:12

Right now the bitcoin hype is huge. If you search trends and look at charts everything is spiking up. MtGox has over 2,000 people waiting to be verified so they can buy. Coinbase is so popular sometimes they run out of coins. 
Saturday and Sunday seem to be the slow days and best time to buy. I'm thinking Monday = $35 and by Friday = $37. 
Good time to buy right now? Assuming everyone who bought low saves all their bitcoins we'll keep watching the price go up. If we watch the price go down by dollars I'm betting more people cash out and new buyers will not buy due to not wanting to lose money. 
I just saw a post saying you can buy almost anything with bitcoins online. More reasons to use bitcoins = good. 
If it drops below $30 I'll be cashing out and I'm guessing a lot of others too. Then when it bottoms out we'll all buy again and jack the price up. 
Good time to buy right now? Yes. Just watch the charts and trends to see if the interest level in bitcoin is high. If it starts going down get ready to sell?
@_date: 2013-03-12 06:47:25
Keep some money in bitcoins for _years_. 
@_date: 2013-03-17 07:09:28
30 days. You can try asking coinbase to white list you and then you can buy 100 coins at a time. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:32:20
To win bitcoins. There is a 50/50 address where you can send 1 bitcoin and maybe get 2 back. Feeling lucky you can bet 10 bitcoins and might receive 20 back. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:10:29
Be careful falling for that hype. It was from 7 cents to 70 cents to 43 cents in 3 weeks.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:20:04
Well, you can put in $500 now. If the price keeps going up then put in $500 more. If it goes down then put in $1,000. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:26:07
Look at the bottom chart where it shows the red and green lines. Red = how many bitcoins needed to bring it to that price.

Someone probably just bought enough bitcoins to bring the price close to each other.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:19:48
When I have enough to retire. At that point though it'll be hard getting it all into cash or my bank account. So I'm hoping the price keeps going up and when I don't have a job I'll sell my bitcoins for enough cash to get by till I die.

Every merchant should be able to accept bitcoins and use a 3rd party that takes the bitcoins, turns it into USD (or whatever they use) and deposits the money into their account.

@_date: 2013-04-30 03:34:29
I would. Support is strong and there hasn't been a crash since it went $160 to $120 recently. I don't think it'll go much lower.

I bought a computer mouse too. Here is the bitcoinstore bitcoin address if you wanted to see how much they have made. 
The guy is smart and keeps everything in bitcoins so when he does cash out he has a lot of money.

Maybe you can hold the bitcoins in an escrow system and pull them out when you want if the pre order product is taking longer then expected.

What if the price shoots up. Then it will be worth it.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:15:48
Depends how many rich people want to buy million dollars worth of bitcoins. I mean, if it goes up $20-$30 you make so much.

The drop could be big. $10-$60 lower before it goes back up. It just depends how many people want to cash out their bitcoins. I think today there were 2-3 big sell offs and the price ended up near the high. So who knows what will happen in the coming days. Try to catch it at a low point and buy or use an exchange and set a buy order at a price you want to buy in at and hope the price falls that low.
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:47:00
I wouldn't buy in at all. This ain't stopping till it goes back to $10.

Well the longer you wait the more money it takes to get whole bitcoins. Ideally 100 bitcoins would be nice so every $1 increase you make $100. Note: I have gambled thousands and thousands away. This is a world wide thing and I'm sure people may put part of their money in bitcoins so incase something happens they have that to fall back onto. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 19:31:31
Now we wait.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:31:10
I've bought and sold over 100 bitcoins with coinbase. They have delivered on their end every time. I am currently waiting on more bitcoins from them in a locked in price and I have no doubts in my mind that I will get what coinbase and I agreed to.
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:08:33
I'm sure most see visitors the first 1-2 days and then they get desperate and start spamming before giving up.

@_date: 2013-05-30 04:41:53
As the people will 1,000+ bitcoins sell and spread them out the price will hopefully go up. I would like to see a tally kept on how many addresses have 1,000+ bitcoins and whether that number goes up or down.

Take the $1,000 in cash. Go to  and find someone selling bitcoins. Meet in person (at a bank) and do the transaction. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 03:21:44
Yeah, I would. Then when the price goes up trade them for bitcoins and you may end up with 6 bitcoins. 
There are a bunch of addresses with 100,000+ litecoins. Who knows what the price will do and who will take litecoins. I'm sure some people would love to unload their litecoins for bitcoins / fiat. It may have more ups and downs. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:25:50

If you believe people are creating ways to more easily buy and use bitcoins then you believe the price will go up. Think of a family member that needs money. You can transfer bitcoins to them and they can spend them or cash them out. Cheap and quick. Hopefully they get some bitcoin ATMs in stores. Then you can deposit cash you make into bitcoins and buy stuff from sites that let you use bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:52:29

Probably because there are 5 new gambling web sites posted over and over here everyday. There isn''t going to be enough people that want to gamble away bitcoins that go up in value everyday. Come up with a different way for people to use their bitcoins. Think outside the box. Be creative.

It scares me a bit. People will see, "I can put $500,000 in and in a week have $1,000,000 and cash out." Then they think, "If I put $5,000,000 in and wait for the price to double I'll cash out and have $10,000,000"
I don't know how a high price will work out. We saw $266 and it came back down to $50. Now almost back to $150 and from there maybe someone will pump us up to $200. Will the people looking to make some quck money cash out millions and bring us down.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:04:41
Because if you don't spend them you'll watch the price hit $260 and then drop to $100 and wish you spent some before you watch your bitcoin wallet drop thousands in value.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:50:51
It would take many many thousands of bitcoins to drop the price a lot. If these people that brought the price up so high cash out then it will drop. I don't see that happening as they would lose money after buying thousands of bitcoins. I see more deep pockets buying bitcoins sending the price up. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 05:20:35

They have had bitcoins available a lot today. Could be many people selling at the high price so they have some available. Maybe the businesses they have partnered up with are providing them with bitcoins to sell. Things are looking up for coinbase.

Is this considered going nuts? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:22:15
It could. Earlier today someone sold 6,000 (one million) and the price went down $10 and then bought back up $10. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:32:07

Yes. You can wait till tomorrow night or the night after to see if the price is still going up. No one knows when the right time is but if you plan on holding onto the bitcoins for months or years then anytime is a good time.

@_date: 2013-04-19 04:49:31
I sold at $105. I bought back in @ a locked in price with coinbase 50 bitcoins for $6300. The day before I get my bitcoins it was like 50 bitcoins = $3,000. I get my bitcoins and the price is 50 bitcoins = $4300. I sold and cut my loss. Then today 50 = $6,000 so if I only held for 1 more day I would have been pretty much even. Goes to show holding is the best way. Well, it would still suck to buy above $120 and still waiting to break even.

Bitcoin ATMs are in the works. Not sure how wide spread they will be though. Otherwise you can visit a web site that tells you to go to a bank and deposit cash into their business account. Then the person sends bitcoins to you minutes later. bitcopia.com is one of those.

The ones that used bitpay are OK. The ones that are not using it are probably backed by some big company or rich person so it won't matter.
@_date: 2013-04-24 02:50:03
Someone may see it as a way to buy a lot of bitcoins without the price going way up. We also could see a lot of large sells as people will buy back cheaper.

Where are all those millionaires at. Buy more bitcoins!!!
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:11:37
Hard to say. Unless something better comes out that people adopt then I would say bitcoin will be the most popular. If rich people want to feel powerful with bitcoin then they will want to buy thousands. The more people that buy thousands the higher the price. Think if you bought 5,000 bitcoins for $600,000. Then a bunch of other people do the same thing. Then the price goes up $20 and now you have $700,000 in bitcoin. More people buy in and soon people have millions in their bitcoin wallet. If they are a business they can send employees overseas and transfer money using bitcoin. They can give out employee bonuses in bitcoin with the option of converting it directly to cash if they choose. Most would want bitcoins if the price keeps going up. Businesses can buy anything with bitcoin. If it keeps going up in price why wouldn't everyone want to adopt it and figuring out how to buy things with bitcoin. 
Then you have people that will watch their $500,000 turn into $2,000,000 and take it all out and the price goes down $20 and causes panic and other people sell. So it will be interesting to see if people come together and just buy in and don't take out.

@_date: 2013-02-27 07:52:33
Monday I got my first 4 bitcoins from coinbase. Since then I put in 2 more orders at 10 bitcoins each order. I'm just hoping the gambling (online poker) industry moves towards using bitcoins and thousands of people follow buying up bitcoins sending the price skyhigh. If not I still hope to make a little money and if not oh well and I'll spend them or lose money if the bitcoin price crashes. The more I read the more I wonder if I'll turn my 20 bitcoins at $600 into 20 bitcoins at $10,000. If only I bought some a couple months ago at $10.

You won't get your coins quickly via coinbase but when you do get them you'll most likely see them worth more then you paid for. No need to get them quickly either (unless you want to spend right away).

I always wonder how much attention bitcoin is getting. For most of us we are looking for bitcoin news so we hear and see more of it giving us the sense it is really taking off. If you ask people on the street about bitcoin and if they are going to buy any most will say, "what?". 
Will we be able to stay steady at 1 price point for a week. Will people cash out thousands. Will there be more people that want to buy hundreds and thousands of bitcoins.

Good advice.
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:50:31
Super rich dishing out bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:27:50
If most people have a few thousand saved up then $10,000 will need to be like .5 bitcoin. So 1 bitcoin = $20,000. It'll probably need to be higher since people all over the world will want some. Better buy some whole bitcoins before they get out of your price range.
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:32:33
Someone was trying to bring the market all the way down but ran out of bitcoins to sell at $50.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:27:57
When I bet 50% and win I always think "what if that was 10BTC I would have won...should I try it..." but I never do.
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:21:14
500 would be awesome. Every dollar increase is another $500 in your wallet. Sometimes it jumps $10 a day. That's $5,000 more then you had the day before. Seriously jealous you can do that. I wish I was rich.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:42:09
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:35:49
Or sell them locally on localbitcoin.com
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:20:55
Hope you bought when it went from $49 to $33 today!
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:25:22
Roger that. Selling instead of buying.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:33:25
I will never panic buy or panic sell.

I saw on the coinbase twitter account they were having some issues. They say all should be good now.
@_date: 2013-09-15 05:55:54
Yeah they could be ramping up production.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:28:18
Can't really predict. Couple days ago nothing really happened. The 2 weeks before that were crazy. I don't think we experienced anything like today. So who knows what is coming up next.

My most recent one was pending for 10 hours. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:14:00
Not sure if anyone does. You would have to be hella rich. What if people bought a shit load of stuff at $250 / bitcoin and then it goes down to $70. Hope you have money to pay for everything since your bitcoin wallet value dropped thousands.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:35:38
Try emailing the bitcopia guy and maybe he'll let you transfer money over. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:05:42
So I can pay without giving out all my info every time. Easier to tip people, pay for manual labor work. I'll pay my lawn mower in bitcoins.

$2.99 a month. It's not that popular. I just checked and **YAHOO is still available. It would suck if people randomly called different ones and then you get a bunch of prank calls.
@_date: 2013-11-05 11:20:01
I think of it this way. There are people putting up sell walls and then they end up with fiat. I'm assuming most people don't want to leave bitcoin and go back to USD / whatever their currency is. So the people putting up sell walls end up buying back in at a higher price or put up buy walls waiting for someone to dump their bitcoins. 
So assuming that most people are not cashing out and moving money to their bank account then how many people will transfer money into an exchange and buy. Right now it seems $1,000,000 USD (or so) moves the price up $10. 
So $10,000,000 brings the price up $100 and lets say that for easy sake.
There are a couple hundred billionaires and a ton of millionaires. Do they want to put part of their savings into bitcoin? Will the price around $1,000 make more people cash out and bring the price down a few hundred? 
It just depends how many rich people get into bitcoin. Eventually most bitcoins will be mined in a few years. If it sticks to the general $10,000,000 USD = $100 price increase then yeah it could go pretty high but I think some people will cash out and transfer money to bank account and retire. So who knows.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:20:58
Looks like the bleeding stopped when someone bought 40,000 bitcoins. Probably the person who was selling all day yesterday.
@_date: 2013-03-24 01:26:19
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:32:08
I hope you know how to hack or scam people. Try convincing some person that they can send 1 bitcoin to you and you'll work your magic and they get 2 bitcoins back. In reality you just keep the bitcoin. Do that 3 times and you end up with 3 bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:02:02
I was trying to troll and was shut down. I'll try again later.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:26:26
People who believe new money is coming in this week and will raise the price. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 07:12:39
After jumping $10 in 2 days one would think the price would go down but it hasn't yet. If it keeps going up you will want to buy in soon. If you are thinking of buying a couple bitcoins then it is less risky as if the price drops after you buy you may lose $50-$100 (a days wage?). Odds are if you hang onto them long term you'll make a small amount of money. What some people are trying to do is buy hundreds of bitcoins. That way if the price goes up in the hundreds they make thousands. If bitcoins really take off then people may make hundred of thousands and even some people will hit million+. By then there will be ways to buy anything with bitcoins so you won't need to cash out into USD. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:32:47
Says the guy wearing an eye patch.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:46:02
That's the scam. You would just keep the bitcoin and they are left wondering what just happened.
@_date: 2013-03-12 01:17:43
The price dropped to $46.21. I'll keep an eye on the price and buy low.
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:55:53
Market is 24/7. Honestly you can wait and hope for a large sell off that may or may not come. Friday night - Sunday night may be the lowest price of the week. I bought some at $76 and one day later it is $81 and it may not come back down. So I would just buy at least some ASAP. It could be $85 tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:23:15
I just noticed someone buying 400 bitcoins a minute ago. Hurry up and buy before the price goes up more. Another guy is thinking about buying 500. I'm sure there are more people out there ready to buy.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:09:48
Right now it would take 20 million to get to $300. I assume more people will sell and it'll probably take more like 50 million to get to $300. That's only 50 people putting in a million. It could happen quickly. Who knows if there is still enough interest in bitcoin for people to put millions into it. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:49:34
people are only putting a couple thousand bitcoins up for sale and rich people will risk some money in bitcoin. need more of them
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:44:54
I use bitcoins in the most simple way. Not sure how to get bitcoins where you are but the go to site would be  and see if there is anyone in your area. Then  to store your bitcoins. Then you can use them when you want. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 07:16:57
Right now. I always say if you want to wait for the price to go up and get less bitcoins you can. Don't say I didn't warn you though.
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:53:42
We hold for years. Every $1 increase I make $1,000. Hoping in a couple years I can live without working for awhile.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:00:41
Or transfer money back to your bank account and into mt.gox
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:25:01
Depends when you sell. Could be as short as a 4 day wait.
@_date: 2013-03-19 05:16:22
Give me all your bitcoins or else I'll blackmail you. muhahahah
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:37:35
Yeah, I feel bad too. Once the price is in the thousands though I won't feel as bad spending a small part of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:20:38
I wanted to chat with my friends in the chatbox too right now.
@_date: 2013-03-27 06:21:27
Business as usual. As more people find out the demand grows. So the price has to go up otherwise there isn't enough bitcoins for everyone. I just wish I had more money to buy more. At this rate in a couple years bitcoins will be worth so much.
@_date: 2013-02-02 09:38:07
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:39:13
Thanks for doing this.
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:32:24
$85.99 right now. But yeah. The longer you wait as you can tell the higher the price.
@_date: 2013-02-26 05:05:40
When it was $10 I wasn't thinking about investing. Then it went up and up. Now I'm thinking there are only 11 million right now and 21 million total and it will take years to hit 21 million. The more people that find out about bitcoin the more people that will want some (assuming it is easy to get and they have a reason to spend bitcoins). If the price stays at or around $30 eventually people will buy a couple bitcoins and there won't be any left. So of course the price will go up so most people would only need 1-2 bitcoins instead of 10+. Will the price go up to $100? $200? $500? If bitcoins catch on and people start buying like crazy I think it will go high. I am buying a bunch now at $30. I don't see it going back down to $10 as more people would buy and there might not be enough bitcoins. It's a gamble but if you have no debt then what's a couple thousand to gamble in hopes that it might turn into $30,000 in a couple years.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:51:51
I'm just gonna wait and see if it will actually go up still before I buy in. 
Couple days later.
Fuck it went up $100
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:08:53
I think large investors will buy more or others will buy and the price will keep increasing. 
I don't think ASICs will have any effect on the market at this time.

Just too cool.
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:56:48
When it dropped from $266 I think MtGox was hit too hard and caused a lot of lag so people sold and by the time the lag cleared up the price was $105 and then a bunch of people bought the price up to $180 and people saw it as their second chance to cash out and the price came back down. Then trading stopped on MtGox. When it came back it dropped again. Then people started buying up the price and then it dropped again this time to $50. Now the price is back up to $143. It seems a lot of people are just holding onto their bitcoins. I say once the price hits $150 we will be back up to $200 soon. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:25:41
Short term I believe it will go up as new money coming in. Then it'll come down a bit.

@_date: 2013-03-14 03:48:02
Really is no tips or tricks. Just buy as many as you want and hold on to them for as long as you can. If you want you can spend some and then buy more bitcoins to replace the ones you spent. Then in a few years they might be worth more. Probably not enough to retire though. Maybe enough for a nice vacation or a new car depending on how many bitcoins you buy now. At least that's what people on will say. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 23:29:17
The guy who bought a million USD worth of bitcoins cashed out Friday afternoon and the price dropped. Bunch of other people panic sold. Then a bunch of smart people bought cheap bitcoins and the price shot back up to $65. Now we wait till Monday and people will buy more coins and the price will be back over $70.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:15:40
Take a look yourself. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:51:01
$90 price increase in 7 days. Due for a correction soon but the price may shoot up next couple days and then correct itself / come down to $200. So right now may be the cheapest time to enter.
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:46:07
Just means less bitcoins to go around which means a higher price.
@_date: 2013-05-09 06:59:43

What gave it away!
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:44:30
We'll never know the amount lost but it has to be up there. Think of the thousands of people that randomly mined and realized it is worth a $1 and just deleted it all. It'll be interesting to see how much higher it goes as it gets more and more expensive to buy 1 bitcoin which may turn people off (or turn people on and they put in thousands).
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:44:44
I don't use them any more. I use coinbase now. Before there was coinbase bitcopia was my go to.

There might be a dip on Saturday or Sunday. Of course by Friday bitcoin price could be at $45 so the dip could be down to $44. 
Right now the goal should be to acquire as many bitcoins as possible and hope over the years people adopt bitcoins and it goes into the thousands. Since you know there won't be many bitcoins left. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 01:51:35
It's usual buying stuff if say you spend 1-2 bitcoins a week and put 1-2 bitcoins back into your wallet a week. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:13:52
Not worth it. Buy some bitcoins and the price will go up and you'll see better gains then in mining.
