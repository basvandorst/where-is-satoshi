and what if the government uses its power to coerce Node operators into rejecting txs from certain addresses or wallets? or what if they mandate KYC laws for node operators. what if the network gets so big, that the only way to be a useful node is to upload hundreds of millions of dollars onto lightening network so that thousands of people can continuously push txs through your node. sounds like youre a bank at that point. If fees on-chain are so high it is unusable, government could use its authority to prevent you from transacting on LN rendering your btc useless. does that sound like an un-censorable ledger to you?

you think we're so stupid, you can rearrange the network in the form of a circle, and nobody will notice there are clearly 6 hubs on the bottom of the circle connecting the majority of users? this is borderline LYING. you have no integrity at all, and are only shilling for your personal portfolio benefit. you dont seem care about decentralization at all.     
I dont have an allegiance to any coin, but it is obviously concerning that you guys are trying to sell Lightning network as the second coming of jesus, when it will be so easy for governments to regulate Lightning hubs as it is NOT anonymous, and will cost large amounts of staked btc in the future as we see the "natural" growth of LN and everyone just connecting to the same nodes. if the goal was to cripple btc and deliver it to the feet of government and regulators, then you are doing your job. LN is obviously at risk of large government intervention, and if you try to claim otherwise, you are being disingenuous or misinformed. all im saying is this is NOT the BEST solution moving forward

bitcoin nodes are free to run, and return no profit. they are worldwide and it doesnt matter which one you use. LN nodes are NOT free to set up, and they also pay out fees over time. making it a business that government will be *very* interested in. there will always be nodes out there that accept txs, but there might not always be LN out there that accept all transaction. so ability to transact on chain is a must.

also it sounds like you dont understand BCH. the average block in bch for the last week has been WELL below even .5mb. however there is an extra 7.5MB of block that is literally just not being used.  
  
 it does less transactions, yes, but that is not because of lack of capacity. it is still lack of use. BCH has about 4 times the capacity of BTC IFFFF btc was 100% segwit adopted, which it is not, it is well below 20% adopted..

to set up a "hub" that many people could use I would need to stake many millions of dollars in bitcoin so that i could have enough liquidity to clear all the transactions. thats why only banks will be able to set up LN hubs.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:43:40
Understand :)  
and as for if all BTC txs moved to BCH right now, thats a really interesting question. Because BTC is a "store of value" now, there are *very* few people trying to conduct daily business on it. If we raised the block size that drastically overnight, we would see a jump in txs as people resume daily transactions that are suddenly affordable.   
if we do a thought experiment here, with 100MB blocks which would allow for a LOT of transactions, but still nowhere near visa numbers. heres what the math looks like.  
  
(100mb x 6) to get total number of MB/hour added to the chain.  
(((100 x 6)24)365) we can see we are now added like 5000GB to the chain every year. which would be stressful on some nodes depending on owners investment, but at that rate we are doing a metric shit-ton of transactions every day as well.

P2P means there is no middle man. I understand how the system works, and im not discounting its utility but its just factually not directly sending money from party A to party B  
  
  
edit:Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. **Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application**. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes

bitcoin isnt P2P despite me sending a transaction directly to the recipient? minus the NETWORK fee which is not a 3rd person like in LN configurations where 3 people interact over a transaction originally between two people. youre paving the way for banks and financial institutions to control btc if you fully support LN as the primary scaling solution. These will be govt controlled LN nodes that will not do txs for you if you owe taxes or have outstanding debt any other thing the govt doesnt like about you and such.

youre comparing a network to a middle man, so theres no point in continuing to debate this if we can agree on what a middleman is. none of those node in the bitcoin network EVER has your money and NEVER handles it. but on LN a third party WILL HANDLE YOUR MONEY. how is that peer to peer?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:08:04

so when i go to the pizzeria and send them money on LN ill send it directly to them? in order to make LN P2P i am required to charge the LN connection before I send money across it, then ill just have $50 locked up in an open LN channel with my pizzeria, and then when I go to the gas station its simple, I just open a LN connection with the gas station, pay the fee to open the channel, charge it with $50, then pay ANOTHER $50 for the transaction, then a fee to close the channel, then another fee to push the transaction onto the blockchain.   
  
  
Lightening as P2P does not work. everyone will create a LN checking account with their "bank" and all stores will need a LN checking account with the same bank and the bank will take fees as a middle man to send the money around.

it is difficult to speak for all libertarians, but I would venture to say most libertarians are not in favor of government action with regards to insider trading. seeing as how it does not violate the non-aggression principle, and participation in all markets are voluntary.  
however many libertarians will tell you it is morally wrong, yet it doesnt necessarily mean governments must pass laws to put people in cages for trading when they know more than other traders. besides, its not even like these laws even prevent government officials of all stripes trading insider knowledge anyways. which they do.. often.....

The difference between LN and natural bitcoin mining is that you need bitcoin to first become a LN node. Literally anyone anywhere with an internet connection can spin up a BTC mining node. unless the government took out every major mining network in one night, then more pools would pop up, new people will fill the void and the algorithm would eventually adjust. Mining is resilient and will continue to prove to be resilient especially with how geographically dispersed it is at this point.   
Money movers dont know the source or destination, but they know the link before them in the chain and the link after them. This is enough to cause major issues as I see it. It makes regulation much less of a monumental task when you can just ask JP Morgan Chase "who" sent them those bitcoins, and they can give a reasonable answer.    
Yes I am sure average Joes who have 10 bucks to spare will leave it in a LN hotwallet that they have to monitor 24/7 so they can give $10 of liquidity to the network "for the greater good"   
LN ending with massive hubs is a major failure and total compromise from the original mission statement of BTC. "Normies" for lack of a better term will be the death of BTC with their tolerance for tyranny and compromise with authoritarian governments and irresponsible banks.   
ahhh yes... the Segwit was a blocksize increase argument. except it took a year for 30% of people to even use it, currently hovering at about 40%. a manipulative but dishonest argument at best there.   
Charlie Lee himself has said that users will likely need watchtower organizations hired to monitor any LN wallets if the system were to catch on in widespread use. For me personally LN is the antithesis to everything that made me interested in BTC in the first place. Sure it is an interesting side project with "cute" applications, but it is not the second coming of satoshi. Blockstream may have talented programmers, I don't know, thats not my field of knowledge, but when you start letting blockstream or "developers" turn code into economic theories and systems, you will find they are out of their depth, just like I don't comment on the base code of LN or bitcoin. I try to keep my opinions limited to policy and economic theory as I believe it is something I can comprehend much better than the minutia of the technology (which is obv still important). 
 
@_date: 2019-01-06 09:43:26
again, I think our difference of opinion comes down to economical and political philosophy and not specific technical details of LN. I dont disagree that the largest and most plausible threat to bitcoin is a massive operation to destroy all major asic farms in one fell swoop, but again, the algorithm should have a better tuned difficulty adjustment so that if that happened, the difficulty could be adjusted fast enough to keep blocks coming and then GPU mining would be feasible again.(assuming you actually got all the asic farms)  
in our current model of governance there are no mom and pop banks because regulation has seen to it that there never will be. this is by design and not by some coincidence of circumstance. free markets lead to monopolies or at the very least economies of scale which tells us the person with the most resources will have the greatest advantage.   
the fact that 40% of txs are segwit is solely Cores fault. They introduced a shitty patch to fix a broken dam and nobody is using it. then they blame the people who dont use their poor fix for not using the poor fix? One block is capped at 1mb right now which is smaller than the capacity of a freaking flippy disk. there is no argument that this is necessary. this is completely artificial so blockstream can sell layer 2 solutions. seriously, smaller than a floppy disk per block. its laughable for a 60 billion dollar network. and imo it is malicious by intent.   
your willingness to accept the idea that we will need to find trusted 3rd parties to monitor our funds is antithetical to bitcoin "the trustless" network. which is why I say we are really discussing a difference in philosophy as opposed to an opposition of technical solutions.  
  
but to r/bitcoin credit, there has been no censorship in our long conversation here and I have never been personally affected by it for my "anti" LN bias. more like aversion to LN as primary method of transacting.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:58:23

@_date: 2017-10-21 08:39:43
thats a lie and you know it. the color change represents SEGwit being imposed on the system, which was the REAL fork. BCH is factually more similar to whitepaper bitcoin. thats just a fact. whether you think that is relevant or not, is up for debate, but segwit was not mentioned in the whitepaper. Core fundamentally changed how bitcoin operates, and some people said they would prefer another route. both chains "forked" both chains changed from the system before. but planning to enable segwit forced them to fork BCH before segwit was enabled. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:09:36
exactly what they said about poloniex before it gave out bch and the price jumped like double. The true issue that BTCers dont seem to want to talk about is that 2nd layer solutions offer very convenient points for government to regulate the manner in which BTC functions. with Lightning network being very centralized and allowing government a convenient opportunity to seize any lightning network nodes and regulate who can send what thru Lightning network effectively turning bitcoin into FEDcoin where we can again deny people access to the blockchain or any other use of the blockchain that requires Lightning or such second layer solutions. this also becomes important as government struggles with HOW TO TAX bitcoin because obviously that is the ONLY thing governments give a shit about. thats one of the larger concerns of BCH hodlers, again of which I am not one. there are some libertarian reddits that are able to have civil discussions about these issues, and it might be better to ask there, since they at least try to maintain integrity and reason in political discussions. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:32:13
doesnt change the fact that the hard fork inevitably was caused by the segwit soft fork. If you didnt want your bitcoin to have segwit for whatever reason, then you had no choice but to fork. If calling one a bastard makes you feel better, then help yourself tho.

And when Pizza Hut and Wal-Mart and Starbucks only route through "verified" LN payment processors (you know LN hubs are money movers and as such face strong regulation to ensure the money is legit, not laundered), your $30 raspberry pi won't matter because the only way to get a transaction routed to anyone of significance is through Chase Morgan &amp; Friends neighborhood LN hub. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:18:19
The Idea is, with LN there is a payments layer and a settlement layer, and this is a perfect place for banks to insert themselves. With banks inserted, governments will make rules about how to use LN "legally" and hold people accountable for transactions they received on LN since you have to actively accept transfers. BTC main chain was different and txs were pushed through without recipients consent. The idea was BTC would be so superior that people would use it and governments would be forced to concede the use of btc and nothing could be done about pablo escobar sending money to anyone he wants including walmart. LN completely voids this. LN can put the onus on money movers to confirm that the money is legit and not black market before they accept it. whereas you could not do this with base layer BTC.   
the second part is exactly my point, that nobody will let others route through their channels. which means people who do let users route through their channels will be rare and those nodes must be loaded with cash to facilitate 24/7 use. this will end in a hub and spoke system that LN proponents swear wont happen. the writing is already on the wall that LN is hub and spoke through the nature of its design. I am ideologically opposed to this view and it means LN cannot be distributed, it is nearly impossible for LN to be decentralized, and highly likely that LN will end with massive hubs with all the cash providing transfers for everyday people. A mirror of today's system.   
lastly, I do not ever believe blockstream will increase the blocksize, and they have torpedoed multiple ideas for multiple years with the most blatant and obvious being 2X which lead to backing out of an agreement between miners and devs that was dishonorable, to say the least. Blockstream would have to admit it was wrong the whole time when it increases block sizes because it has been making all manner of arguments as to why even 2MB would be "too big". They have painted themselves into a corner. This is the same company that popped bottles of champagne when fees hit $50 only a year ago. This entire design is going exactly to plan. This is what they want, the course they have chosen for how BTC will function. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 09:27:12
crypto will be used, and LN may even be used mainstream, but it will not be what was originally intended when BTC was made to be permissionless and trustless. I can't say if LN will catch on, but I can say that it resembles the current banking structure quite nicely.   
Yes, we know we can't count on our routing channel being available day to day, but that has not been the marketing ploy used by blockstream. Most people here shilling for LN don't even realize that if someone routes through them that they can't actually use the money they just charged onto the LN with the channel they intended to. It's a massive inherent flaw that will lead to nobody openly routing transactions for friends. It also benefits banks who can easily afford to throw millions into wallets and LN nodes every day.   
Again, I am not saying the whole of LN is garbage, I am just saying it is not the most ideal payments network, and much too closely resembles the one we already have today. Im sure for just me and my buddy Joe, LN would be fine to share money back and forth for pizza and beers, but when tx fees on the main chain hit $50 again, people are gonna be sitting around realizing LN will not save them like they thought it would. and tx fees 100% WILL hit $50 again, that I can guarantee.
@_date: 2018-12-25 07:50:59
The design of the system funnels all of the transactions directly at the *regulated* banks we just tried to escape from. LN has serious regulatory issues in its near future. We wouldn't want Pablo Escobar funneling his drug money through our Deutchebank LN node to make a purchase with Delta Airlines, now would we. Government is coming, like it always does, to clamp down on the movement of money (especially with how easy LN makes it for one to reject a transaction). 
@_date: 2018-12-24 05:44:56

My point is trusted vendors such as McDonalds^^TM or Walmart^^TM will ONLY do business through JP Morgan Bank Trusted LN Node^^TM. And JP Morgan Trusted LN Node^^TM will only allow connections with trusted money movers because you step in loads of regulatory dog shit when you start moving money for people. Basically, the LN is a money launderer's wet dream, and that is why it will never happen as a payments layer. Liquidity is a whole nother issue that is obviously going to favor large central banks because if JP Morgan Trusted LN Node^^TM has  a connection with Walmart and everyone is trying to spend money at Walmart, then JP Morgan Trusted LN Node^^TM will have to constantly add more and more money to its connection with Walmart, which average folks cannot be fucked doing. For example, if I connect directly with Walmart, and leave my node with them public, the next time I come to Walmart, I may find that my money is not on that channel anymore, because my friend Bob used our connection to transfer his money to Walmart. I now have credit from Bob on my channel with him and no money on my channel with Walmart. It's basically a clusterfuck of IOUs that you either deal with or never help anyone transfer money. which is exactly how it was designed and intended to work.   
To expound upon my last point, Walmart will never open an LN channel with me because if Pablo Escobar uses my LN channel with Walmart to transfer any sum of money, Walmart is now culpable in the FBI investigation around money laundering and it's a massive ballache and regulatory shitstorm. So if you want to use LN at Walmart, you will *have* to use JP Morgan Trusted LN Node^^TM  
These are all examples but point to general rules of operation counter to what Bitcoin originally functioned as. LN has utility, but not as a payment layer. And choking the block size to force people to use LN as a payment layer is a massive red flag for me.
