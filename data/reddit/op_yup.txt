They are brilliant at fucking you over. They are con artists. 


like seriously. Do i even need to break this down?


it's the first secure and the most immutable database ever created in history of man kind. Yes, you can't lick it, but it has value. You can't put Facebook in your pocket either but that network has immense value. their excuses are stupid. 
Then you have that stupid graphs that shows "bitcoin is following a classic bubble pattern"   STFU!!!  So, you are good at spotting pattern   how about this pattern 
it's called a jumping S curve. 
if you take Morgan stanley's opinion on bitcoin seriously, then you should also take Hollywood advice on sexual harassment seriously as well. 
is that better for you?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:41:24
hi, i'm a dumb twat. i have questions about this thing that I'm sure no one has asked in the last decade. It's not like there is a half a trillion dollar bounty on breaking it. My questions are so unique and im sure no one has asked them before! i'm so smart!
