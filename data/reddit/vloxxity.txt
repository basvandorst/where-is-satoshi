Not that crazy, but i was in my developer apprenticeship between 2011-2012 i looked into bitcoin because i din't have anything to do at work, then i started to develop some sort of minimalistic online casino for BTC so i got a few from faucets to test it but everything just for fun not really thinking about investing in it (don't really know where those ended up). Then as the price rose and i thought about investing almost all my savings in it but didn't really have a clue where to get them (because i was underage and my mom laughed about me when i talked to her about bitcoins) and found someone at [ebay-kleinanzeigen.de]( the german version of craigslist who wanted to sell a some BTC that i wanted to buy but he already sold it to sb then i lost focus on the task and came back when the prices were way higher and thats why im not retired yet! But now my whole family is onto bitcoin, we did made a 'bit' of money but we all could have already retired if s.B. would have taken underage me serious!  
I still got some emails saved where i missed the deal of my life and i guess i still got the sourcecode somewhere!

@_date: 2016-12-08 18:28:32
could you comment the line located right over "Block size over time" here pls?
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:29:47
I just wanted to say that the last headline was wrong!
See edits in comment.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:02:57
you (are confused...
How big is the [Blockchain](
it is almost 93,114 MB!
The picture says it is 1mb forever!
ive already statet that [here]( but people seem to be too stupid to read right?!
@_date: 2016-12-08 23:18:16
i know and i didn't write that anywhere, so why are you telling me this?
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:23:07
Wrong text in picture: Bitcoin **blockchain** doesn't grow. 1mb forever
Corrected text: Bitcoin **block-size limit** doesn't grow. 1mb forever
See the blockchain growth [here](
EDIT bcs some ppl dont seem to get it?!:
The headline over the last picture says:
"Bitcoin **blockchain** doesn't grow. 1mb forever" (although its 93,114 already)!!
And the Picture shows a chart of the constant **blocksize** (1mb wich is correct)!!
Edit 2: 
That wrong was aimed at the headline over the last picture not the title of this Post!
I didnt inted to express an opinion or that i (don't) support a new/flex/bigger block size!
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:12:41
dip? what are you talking about? im still up almost 100%!
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:38:35

The upper two and the right bottom silver one are the coins you can buy at ebay for 1€ each and alibaba even just for a few cents. But the bottom left one might have some collector worth or there may be still bitcoins on it...  
[I dont know the producer of that coin but i found a picture of a similar online that has a qr code on the back like yours?!](
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:26:18
i already tried to tell you 10h ago that there are services like that xD
@_date: 2019-01-18 21:10:06
The last time i checked (few years ago) there were reputable trustworty services that had pools so you just needet to trust them not a third party...  
I dint really got that deep into that because i dont have anything to hide \^\^
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:54:59
Yeah its the right way but it needs some time... and most beggars are at places where ppl dont have that time!
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:51:18
yeah all those page have distinct classes for the tickers so its toally possible!
Adblock Plus rules:
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:24:05
You can tumble/mix/wash those coins so you can't really track them back!
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:37:37
Im sure that you can specify special rules in adblock plus and hide those tickers!  
What sites are you talking about exactly?  
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:05:37


So you are recommending [Structuring](

you mean the lowest bidder with a unique offer?
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:26:28
German here!  
If you buy and sell for profit, the profit is taxable if its over 600€ but when you hold 1 year before selling its taxfree!  
But im not sure what happens if you pay something with BTC i guess the one getting the bitcoins will have to income tax etc...
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:57:43
buy stuff directly with bitcoins?
