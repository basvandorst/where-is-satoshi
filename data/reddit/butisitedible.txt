I wouldn't be opposed to running a full node - storage is relatively cheap, after all - but for various annoying reasons I can't open the port necessary for my node to be helpful to others on the network, so the work spent verifying transactions would be wasted if I understand things correctly.
GreenAddress appears to be an online wallet; I'm trying to avoid this as much as possible. I'd like to use a local wallet, if possible! I was using MultiBit, but of course that hasn't been maintained for a while and I think I need to migrate to something else. (Talking of which: If I send Bitcoin to another address from MultiBit - which doesn't understand SegWit - will the funds be usable in a SegWit-capable wallet, or would I have to regain control of my wallet from a SegWit-capable wallet before sending the funds?)

I have what might be considered a noobish question, but I'm finding it difficult to find the answer to this in an FAQ.
As I understand it, the blockchain is basically a ledger of all transactions ever made with Bitcoin - sending address, receiving address, and Bitcoin amount. Full nodes validate the entire blockchain; lightweight SPV clients do not, and have to ask a third-party server.
I also note that it's recommended to generate a new address for each transaction, for privacy purposes, so people can't learn which addresses belong to you.
My question is, how can a full node validate the blockchain if new addresses are routinely generated? In other words, if there's a transaction from address A to address B, and then a brand new address C appears sending bitcoin to address D, how can it be validated that address C actually got that bitcoin from address B as opposed to making it up?
Do bitcoins themselves have an ID of sorts? And if so, wouldn't this give away the fact that addresses B and C belong to the same person?
I'm so sorry for this question but it seems surprisingly difficult to find an answer in an FAQ.

So Core can run as a pruned node by itself, then? I actually wasn't aware of this - I thought it required the full blockchain.
I do have one question - is there a way to find out what policies the majority of Bitcoin nodes are running? Gentoo appears to default to including patches for the replace-by-fee policy, but I notice that this is somewhat controversial. I'd be interested to know what most nodes are doing.
Also, do I need to use Bitcoin-Qt to use Core as a wallet? If not, is bitcoin-qt a good idea anyway?
Thanks for the info, it's very helpful!

Thank you for your response! So if I'm parsing that correctly, B and C are actually the same address and can't be different like I thought?
If that's the case then I guess addresses will be used for two transactions, not just one like I've heard is recommended?

What are the best open-source Bitcoin clients for Linux which aren't Electrum?
(I unfortunately cannot use Electrum on my distro - Gentoo - because it uses dnspython, which in turn uses **pycrypto**. This conflicts with the newer, better-maintained **pycryptodome**, which Gentoo is migrating towards. This makes it impossible for me to install Electrum without using a virtualenv, and I'd rather use the Gentoo ebuild system of compiling from source rather than relying on binaries.)
