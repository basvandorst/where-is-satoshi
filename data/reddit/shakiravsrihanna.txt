I sold at 11500, didnt buy on dip at 5900. I am waiting for new dip. I think it isnt smart to buy right now after this PUMP, i will wait few days, i am pretty sure another dip will come.

I missed the dip at 16k, another dip at 14k, another dip at 12k, another dip at 10k, another dip at 8k, another dip at 6k... Damn it! I didint buy a lottery ticket today, i missed the win numbers.

Are you on drugs or what? Where do you see 21 big peak? Small peak doesnt count.

Amateur... I didnt pick a random spot. Do you know what is a PEAK?

Its really hard to say in which point selloff will begin.

Nobody knows where is the top before next crash. It can reach 11k. Also, it can crash to 6k. Bitcoin raising up for a whole week, maybe more... Maybe its time to new DIP?

I see you cant understand. How old are you?
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:03:07
