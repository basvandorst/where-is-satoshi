Litecoin will be used for everyday purchases such as coffee. For cars and houses, that's where Bitcoin comes in.

60% of the time, it works all the time.

Peter Schiff was right about the economy, but he's wrong about Bitcoin. Really wrong.

I don't know, that's a little quick. That would need 100k+ subs every month.

It will. Give it a year.

We don't, but I was using the assumption that it would keep going up.

Pepperidge farm remembers.

It's still something. Growth on reddit means more exposure and more users.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:46:02
It's just as valid, just not as accurate. I made good from assuming it will keep going up, which it has.

What about when quantum computers become cheaper and more widespread and can have enough power to threaten the blockchain in 20 years?

Well, if you dollar cost average an asset that is constantly moving up, you're going to miss out compared to someone who bought everything at a lower price.

I noticed that too, but... What does 90% deceleration mean?

I honestly wouldn't worry about it. People are flooding into Bitcoin and will continue to do so. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

I don't know about that, man. The debt bubble can inflate for a much longer time than most would think.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:41:30
No idea. If you find out, let me know please.

I noticed this as well. At this rate, we should be hitting 400k in 3 weeks or less.

There are only 33 million millionaires in a world full of 7 billion plus people. That's a small percentage, so no, "lots" of people aren't millionaires. Even less are MULTImillionaires.

Mathematically, this is impossible. Unless you're a multimillionaire.
