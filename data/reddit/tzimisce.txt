Making the transaction is entirely the customers burden. People who want a good customer experience should use a payment method that aims to be customer friendly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:52:40
It's the customers responsibility to send a transaction that gets confirmed in a reasonable time so it will still be roughly the same value.
I'll admit the price fluctuations have been pretty big lately though.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:57:10
It's not unusable. Those that want to use it just need to set a low fee and wait. And Steam's customer service needs to realize users contacting them about 20$ fees or partial txs are either trolls or idiots and they need to stop enabling both.
If I were their customer service my reply would just be: "Using Bitcoin requires a certain degree of knowhow. We are sorry you lack it but we cannot help you at this time."

A country plagued by misguided policies and corruption breaking down, its situation worsening week by week.

In place of a meal the bankers will have a loan offer with staggeringly high interest rate and as collateral every natural resource in the country that is worth anything.
The government and people decide to hold out until the last moment possible and just as the last shred of hope begins to flicker out an international community offers the most crazy and stupid idea imaginable-
Ehh, just gonna stop here for now at least. If someone takes this can I have a small credit for inspiration?

They had $20B in 2015 and the $10B figure is from this year. So there is time and besides, segwit code and LN are tested and ready for deployment. It's just a matter of certain people getting over their stubbornness or whatever.
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:17:03
1. The loan can be paid in installments, each installment would be delivered once a specific part of implementation would be complete.
2. They can make their own coinbase-clone and use it as a bank thus enabling their precious corruption to continue.

I've heard this "blocks are full" nonsense for years now. I have long since ran out of fucks to give about the false alarms about blocksize change.
Segwit is coded, tested and ready to go AND it will give more block space to last until LNs can take burden off from the blockchain.

@_date: 2017-03-02 16:05:58
Should this be started, can you imagine the attention and subsequent effect on price of bitcoin this would bring? I mean by the time this offer made and considered, paying it back would be the least of anyones concern.
To make profit on this, I would recommend that nobody used over 1/10 of their total btc to fund the loan.
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:42:12
Bitcoin has survived and continues to survive with ALL transactions on current limited chain space. Any solution that can cut anything, mustard or otherwise, must deal with exponential growth and no block size change can deal with it. Majority of transactions do not belong on-chain (buying coffee etc.) so we must have off-chain solutions and the most credible step forward to deal with it is to enable segwit so we can start developing LN for production use.
Blocksize change is needed eventually, but to divert attention to it before segwit activation is from this point of view not a very positive thing for Bitcoin.
Lastly, the debate to change blocksize is never really about blocksize but who gets to decide when to change blocksize. Any attempt to change blocksize is a form of power grab and I respect Core for staying mostly neutral about it.
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:51:16
They would certainly try if we let them. In another comment I mentioned paying the loan in installments, each installment would only be paid once a specific part of implementation of btc to be a national currency would be complete.
Anyway, for this to get to a point where anyone would even _acknowledge_ the possibility that this might happen would make it a wild success.

Wow, so if the assert thing goes unnoticed in BU because of no code review there could also easily be things that leak your private key in BU code. Would be very easy and profitable to do for one of the BU devs.
Or not private key directly, but some variables that could lead into possible private key discovery.
Could this explain why miners don't run BU but a Core client that signals it's BU?

Star Wars used to be golden vision-backed, enforced by Lucas. This was changed after the francise was aquired by Disney. They silently changed it to fiat-type backing. 
People were hopeful going in the first movie but there was no golden vision-backing, instead introducing several different plots that "could go somewhere in the future". TLJ then took this new kind of market, abused its power and inflated everything to zero, leaving people disillusioned. 
ROS will make even the last defenders of fiat-backed Star Wars turn around so finally everyone will demand and be ready to adopt a blockchain-backed Star Wars.

We should absolutely NEVER expect or start taking for granted that the community is somehow immune to being tricked. If we do, the fight for Bitcoin is lost.

As for Bitcoin, 2x succeeding would probably divide the community and be a huge setback in a lot of ways. But as some say, Bitcoin should never be too big to fail.

Using blanket confirmation requirements for all transactions is just plain wrong.
I understand requiring 1 or more confimations from deposits by new accounts, but regular accounts should be allowed to have convenience as long as they don't try to double spend.
E.g. account with 10 purchases could have 0-conf on payments less than $20 and an account with 50 purchases could have 0-conf on payments less than $50.
Alternatively what you could do is have zero-conf on all payments less than say, 50$ UNLESS a double-spend attempt has been detected in the last 24 hours.

Umm, doing the hacking is the easy part.. Finding suitable partners and doing idea exhanges is much more difficult. I would have liked an open discussion forum with small presentations much more.

Naturally the donations would go to an escrow account owned by a well-trusted third party. No, there isn't one yet.
If we would get a significant amount, say 200+ BTC there, then UWE would be notified that if they start accepting BTC in their store in 30 days (or more?), they would receive the funds in that account. Otherwise the funds would be returned to the addresses they were sent from.
