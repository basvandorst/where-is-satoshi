Any thoughts on when the next bch pump is coming? The timing of those things is usually predictable, right?

Major props if you haven’t sold, but keep your seatbelt fastened, this might not be over yet. Korea and Japan like to provide overnight surprises. They see fake news just like us...but then there’ll be a big bounce-back.

Lots of exchanges have it, but it’s easy to set up an account on cryptopia if you don’t have one. Coinmarketcap shows where it is

I got in at 6K, a couple weeks before the last BCH coup d’etat attempt. Keep in mind, that one had a couple aftershocks following the first drop. If that drop is any guide, then Korea and Japan are receiving their round of fake news right about....

Circulating supply is 100 billion, max supply doesn’t seem to exist.  Aaaand, I just bought 40k...What else should we pump? Holy crap, Monacoin’s got a kitty on it!

Does anyone know how to get the mods involved in this? I tried to make it a post as well, and it didn’t work for me either.

Coinbase just added a new currency. The drama exists because they chose to add the currency that has this...leader, who’s been engaging in an ongoing coup d’etat attempt over what is the real bitcoin for several months now. This may be a turbulent next couple days, but in the end, I suspect BTC, (bitcoin), will see 30K by...let’s say January 5.

It’s hard to know what will happen with BCH over the next several days. A similar event occurred several weeks ago. One morning, CNBC was suddenly running stories that raised the question of what is the real bitcoin (BTC or BCH). BTC’s price then dropped from 7.8k to 5k. Simultaneously, BCH went from well under 1K all the way to around 2k, but then even more quickly, it dropped back all the way to around 1k again, and BTC was at 18k within a few weeks.
Frankly, it is difficult and maddening to try and time the market. If you want to sleep well at night, diversify - put a little in each of the top 5 or 10 coins - open up accounts on other exchanges and go even broader than that. The whole market cap is going up, and I bet that continues. 
Personally, I reallocated a bit more into BTC last night, because I do think it will shoot up nicely over the next few weeks as the smoke clears, but I could be wrong. 
Also, just for general background to keep in mind, I’ve put only a very small percentage of my investable assets in crypto, beginning about 2 months ago. I’m a risk averse person, and diving in even to the small extent I have makes me nervous. So far it’s worked out well, and I’m staying in for the foreseeable future, but this whole space is risky, and it’s always tempting to put more and more in.

Has this tidbit been shared on the coinbase sub?

May the doge pump begin...

Pretty much. And the US also doesn’t give its athletes as much financial support as most major countries. There was an hbo real sports episode about that recently. 
Come to think of it, if a bunch of people were to organize and airdrop a bunch of low income Olympic athletes some bitcoin, that just might be pretty pretty pretty good publicity...
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:54:05
Hmmm, not sure about that, but tax or not, the bitcoin’s probably worth more if we’re keeping out the sentimental factor.

Somebody may have called him that, but if it has a messiah, it’s obviously satoshi.  If it has a real human as messiah, just as easily as Andreas, it could be nick szabo, Ned finney, Gavin Andreson, wlad van der laan, Elizabeth stark, the winklevii, Dorian nakamoto...there’s too many choices, so there’s really none.

Okay, in some ways crypto isn’t comparable to the stock market, but in some ways it absolutely is. I’m not sure if Eugene Fama has actually commented on this, but I see no reason why efficient markets theory wouldn’t apply to crypto in pretty much the same way as it applies to the stock market.  So, I’m skeptical about the utility of obsessing over charts as you describe. 
Another way of describing my skepticism is this: If you always sell soon after you buy as long as you’re up a decent amount, then I guess you get lots of 10% returns. But if you always abandon the upside like that, you never get a 5000% return. Lots of coins have done 5000% in the past year despite this recent dip, and the holders you make fun of have benefited.  Now, I’m not saying bitcoin will go up that much this year, but I suspect more than a few icos will.

This tether conspiracy theory stuff has really gone wild. When did the anti-bitcoin people become crazier than the bitcoin people?

Whatever the medal is worth, I hope there aren’t too many medalists selling them. The idea of an Olympic medalist selling his medal because he needs the money is a pretty sad and undignified thought.
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:42:31
That’s what I always assumed too, and I bet a lot of Olympic prospects think that, but Bryant Gumbel convinced me otherwise. Seriously, that Real Sports episode is pretty good. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:36:27
US Olympic athletes would probably rather get a bitcoin than a medal.  I keep hearing they’re all broke!
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:39:39
Oh, lol, maybe that’s what the guy in the photo is already there doing. But I wonder how much of the ‘team’ sponsorship actually gets to athletes’ pockets. My thought was more like airdropping some bitcoin directly to the addresses of athletes.

Dude, the whole market cap has been going down. Virtually no coin has risen in the past few weeks. It’s not just bitcoin.  If you’re in this space, you’ve been losing money. In the past few weeks, there are almost no exceptions. But, whatever, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Maybe you’re somehow not lying. So, what has been in your portfolio that has made money recently?
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:49:31
No, I don’t think they have all that tether backed in $, but why would they? Most people who use tether don’t actually exchange it directly for $. They’re more likely to exchange tether with cryptos. When they get out of crypto altogether, they exchange btc or eth for $. It seems to me that the only reason they would need to have all that tether backed by $ is if everyone who held tether tried to exchange all their tether for $ virtually at once. Not gonna happen. So I respectfully disagree that this is a legitimate issue.
