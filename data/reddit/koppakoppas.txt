Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying. Mark Karpeles walked out of the office, his shaky arms overflowing with bitcoins, and handed them to a masked man.
If you aren't going to try to engage, perhaps bitcoin isn't the best thing for you to be playing around with.

MtGox literally gave them bitcoins. Not "funds", and not "stolen".

I'm not part of a cult, I'm just a hell of a lot smarter than most of you. Watch. This was horrible, a tragedy, how could one man stoop so low/be so incompetent, whatever.
The real world result is that we now have an extremely solid base of support and 6% of coins (which is way WAY more than 6% of owned and liquid coins) in VERY strong hands that are almost guaranteed not to dump them on the market in any noticeable volume.

Bitcoin does a good enough job discrediting itself, no government intervention required.

It's actually far more likely they were just incompetent at programming and gave the bitcoins away to people who knew the exploit.

Let me help you then. The developers fucked up. The developers of both the protocol and some exchanges are to blame.

I was thinking, what would be needed to reach such extremely high value? PayPal has around 120 million active users. Would that do the trick for bitcoin to reach $100,000 (average per user would be 0,1BTC)? When do you think bitcoin will reach this value?
$1,000 (0,01BTC) for the person to guess the exact date (and I don't accept 'never' for an answer)! ;)

They need more people to deposit before they allow withdrawals because they don't have everyone's Bitcoins.

Blame the protocol, price goes down, buy BTC back and then say "hey everyone, we are back, you can now withdrawl, thanks."

I'd like to take a stab at explaining Bitcoin malleability so I wrote this script to be used for a short video and blog post.
I know this explanation takes a few shortcuts and isn't entirely accurate for example in the sense that Bitcoin tracks inputs and outputs, but to give someone a brief overview, these shortcuts are in my opinion necessary.
I'd love feedback on the script, and if it's reasonable, I'll create the video and post shortly.
Script start
So, you heard about the malleability issue of Bitcoin. Let me explain how it works and what it really means for you.
Let's say you hire Jane Plumber to fix your sink for $100. After Jane completes her work, you write a check for $100, sign it, and send to Jane, thinking nothing of it.
[image of original check]
Upon receiving the check, Jane annotates the check in some insignificant manner, for example by stamping it or writing a note that it has been received. She then sends the check to the bank to get the $100 deposited.
[image of annotated check]
In Bitcoin, the check is analogous to a transaction. It is a signed statement from you that you want to transfer an amount to someone else. To declare that you intend to do so, you publish a cryptographically unique signature, or in this analogy a unique image so that anyone can see that you intend to pay Jane $100.
All of these images or transactions are store in the Bitcoin blockchain which is a public ledger of all transactions made by anyone. In this analogy each transaction is a picture of a check, a check signed by you, but that can be published to the public ledger by anyone who has that check.
[image of grid of checks illustrating a transaction block]
As such, when Jane annotates the check, she can also publish the annotated image of the check. The annotated check does exactly the same thing; it withdraws $100 from your account and transfers to Jane. However, because of the annotations, the image that Jane publishes is different from the one you publish.
Although there are two check images published, only one of the images will be accepted by the bank or in this case the Bitcoin network. The details of how this happens is beyond the scope of this explanation, but involves a transaction history which ensures that you cannot give away the same dollar twice.
However, a malicious attacker can exploit this if you are a bit naive. If Jane's image is the one accepted, Jane can call you and say that she never received the check. When you then go into the public ledger and search for your original image, it is nowhere to be found because it was Jane's image that got accepted.
If you are naive, you may then write Jane a new check, and she can withdraw your $100 twice, once for each check you sent her.
If this happened outside of Bitcoin, it would be very simple to check whether Jane was telling the truth. You can simply check your bank statement and see whether the charge for the personal check has been posted to your account. If so, Jane is lying and you can simply ignore her request.
[image of bank statement]
The malleability component of Bitcoin is the protocol's ability to interpret the intent of the check, so to speak, even if it has been annotated with certain pieces of information or decoration. It is still the same check designed to do the same thing, but it looks a bit different than when you originally signed it.
Please also note that although you can make simple changes to a check or Bitcoin transaction, any change that is of importance, such as the sum you want to pay or to whom you send the money, can not be changed. If you attempt this, Bitcoin requires a new signature from you, and it's not as easy as just copying the signature from a paper check.

Script end
Keep in mind, this is intended as a simplified explanation and not necessarily a technically accurate description, neither of checks nor the malleability issue.
Jesus man, I'm dying here. I'm actually dying.

You risked an asset you believed to have value on a private exchange.
You lost.


The verifiability of your transaction is irrelevant. You willingly gave your money to a private corporation.  Your money is gone.

They were stolen with relative ease because Bitcoin is a highly flawed protocol.

That's a 20%+ return in 23 hours.
Watch, the price will go up from 590. Check tomorrow, it will break 600. It may then go parabolic, too soon to tell
Yes - bitcoin is hilariously volatile. It speaks volumes about you that you consider a 20% change in 23 hours to be *a good thing*.
ps the price is now 555, hth.
