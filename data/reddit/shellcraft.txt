Coinbase because they will understand when you send them a link to a block explorer site showing that the transaction occurred and was confirmed. Humblebundle's people might not understand.

Pool owners need to be trusted to pay out to individual miners what they owe them. This an example where their honesty is tested publicly. Not returning the money could have consequences.

This particular faucet is using adsense. I imagine the rest are doing the same because Google's ad network is head and shoulders above the rest. The ones that don't use it can't survive.
Why is that relevant? I think Google does a much better job of screening ads than the other networks.

Yes you can give them access to your wallet in your will so they can spend your bitcoins. There are more complicated solutions to this as well. Dead man's switch type setups, smart contracts, multisig and what not.

Core flushes the key pool the first time you set a password i.e. the first time the wallet is encrypted. This [I know for sure]( But does it flush the key pool when you *change* the password?

This doesn't sound secure. If both the shop and perfect money have the key then in a situation like this we can never tell who is responsible for leaking the key. It could be either PM or you. 
Instead of a shared key they should use public key crypto and have their own key pair and only share the public key with everyone. The private key that is used to generate signatures should remain private and in the possession of PM only. The public key can be used by anyone to verify the signatures without needing access to the private key.

I can understand an API. This will allow you to download extensions/addons/plugins to add new features to your mycelium wallet sort of how you can with wordpress/firefox/chrome. But it should still remain a bitcoin wallet. 
I don't like the other ideas. This whole talk of full financial management doesn't look good to me because it will make it a complicated app. I think you need a big screen desktop app for this sort of thing.
Also selling shares like this could get you into trouble with regulators in the future. Have you thought of this? The US SEC has very long arms. Residing in Europe won't save you guys.

If someone asks for the money back how can the OP determine whether that person is the original owner of the bitcoins or not?

Unspent outputs are the inputs of a transaction. Those outputs can belong to any number of addresses controlled by any number of entities. There is no rule saying that only one person's bitcoins can be spent in a transaction.

They are distancing themselves from bitcoin even as they start accepting it. I've never seen a company say these things when they start taking bitcoin. They all accept it via payment processors but none of them states it publicly like this as if bitcoin is a small pox blanket or something.

so he picked a sig from the blockchain. big deal. you know this is no way to prove anything and nowhere does he claim that this is a sig proving anything. why put up a sig with no corresponding message? it makes no sense.

TBH I don't think it's a conspiracy. I would like to dispute this bit:


Gavin knows proof when he sees it:
He could be lying but he can't claim to be have been fooled.

The authenticity of the source is verified when you connect to it. Both the website and the download are over HTTPS. Yes I'm aware that if the server is compromised then checksums are no good. I've said as much above:

Oooooh important things! This is more joke/sarcasm than important announcement.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:37:48


Yes let's see what happens. I'd like to see public proof too.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:10:46
with no message we don't what the signature is for. A signature is supposed to verify the authenticity of a message but there is no message. It's just a sig with no context meaning it's just an example.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:32:24
I've linked to that very same post above so I've seen it. If you read [gavin's blog post]( he says he met the guy and saw cryptographic proof that hasn't been made public. He's convinced it's him.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:01:34
False devils too?
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:40:50
You need the message, the sig and the address in question for us lay people to verify the whole thing. Bitcoin ninjas may be able to do it with just the first two things (coz they can get the address from the signature). I only see the sig in that blog post. What is the message he is signing? 
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:07:21
**No sigs** have been made public yet so it's definitely the case that Gavin saw proof that hasn't been made public. The sig Wright has published on his site is just an example. You need the message, the sig and the address to verify this shit and all he's put up there is some sig with no context. It seems to be just an example. I hope you understand now.
@_date: 2016-05-05 09:57:08
He certainly looks like a Satoshi.

he isn't doing so publicly. he's only done it privately for gavin, jon and some media outlets. he should post proof publicly.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:00:38
I've already [asked above]( what the message and address for that signature was so we could verify it. I don't think that signature was for anything important. It was just included as an example in the blog post as meni rosenfield says:
Anyway we can go back and forth all day over this. I'm just going to wait and see what the other experts have to say about this (yes I know luke jr. has already shared his opinion). I mean the other core devs. Let's see what nullc has to say.

You should give it back.

So the laptop was supplied by Wright? With the system where the sigs are verified compromised it doesn't matter what additional precautions were taken.

A white man calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto would be interesting indeed. Over the net is one thing. But in person? Introducing himself by a Japanese name? Doing public speaking? People would remember something like that.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:17:20
No it's not. The sig is just something he picked up from the blockchain to show as an example:
I thought you had already seen the above. Sorry.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:09:05
But no message and no address. God you are dense:
and here:
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:13:51
He is not claiming the sig in the blog post is proof of anything. A bare sig with no message doesn't mean anything anyway. It's just an example:
@_date: 2016-05-06 10:44:43
Wow I'd love to see that. Yes please!
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:50:55
Are you saying Gavin doesn't know definite cryptographic proof when he sees it? The man was the lead developer of bitcoin core. He knows what he's talking about.
Also it's not the same as the blog post on Wright's site. He met the guy in person:

In his [blog post]( under "Signing" he says he has signed arbitrary text messages that people have given him. So why refuse the economist?
Also on his blog page there is javascript code that detects when you press alt, shift or ctrl and displays a message "the key is not available". WTF?

SSL cert checks are automatic. If the cert is not valid for the domain name in question your browser will not load the website at all. This also applies to command line tools like curl and wget. They will refuse to connect to the server.
You don't just need to MITM the connection. You also need to compromise the user's system. Install a fake root certificate there that will verify the fake electrum cert that the browser sees. It's possible to do this if you supplied the laptop the user used.
The other way to do this is if you got control over the domain name electrum.org and/or managed to social engineer a recognized certificate authority and got them issue you a cert for electrum.org and download.electrum.org. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:23:16
I take Gavin seriously. If he's saying something then it's worth listening to him.

This is the page:

They could just have verified the md5sum/sha256sum of the binary tarball instead of the GPG sig.
Another possibility is that the dates got messed up. You know timezones have to be taken into account.
Finally "UK IP" means you are relying on the accuracy of geoip mapping databases and those can sometimes be inaccurate or out of date for some IP addresses. These days IP address blocks are changing hands a lot because of the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and those IPs maybe associated with other countries in those geoip mapping DBs.

Ooh it says satoshi nakamoto in the pic :

The web page and the download are both over HTTPS. 
I'm not saying it's impossible to do this. We saw with what happened with Linux Mint recently that it *is* possible. 
I'm just pointing that "no access from UK IP" does not necessarily mean there was no download from CW and Gavin on that day. I've outlined a number of ways this could have played out above. IMO it is not proof positive of no download.
