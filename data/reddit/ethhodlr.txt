Still, the risk is there. The Chinese advantage is cheap electricity, which is state-run. The Chinese government has the ability to imperil the network simply by cutting electricity to miners. This is why internet companies shouldn't do business in China. It's a regime built on authoritarianism.

BF's standard price is $1,395. But you can negotiate that down by $200.
The service they provide is setting up the LLC, filing the paperwork with the feds, and connecting you with their custodian. In theory, you could do this yourself and save money, if you knew a lawyer and found an IRA custodian who agreed to work with you.

I'm in the process of setting up with Broad Financial. There is a set-up fee of $1,395. Plus a one-time custodian set-up fee of $100. Annual custodian fees are about $200 per year.
What they do is help you set up an LLC for your IRA. Funds go from your existing IRA to your new LLC IRA. You'll get a check in the name of that LLC, which you take to a bank to open a checking account.
From there, you need to open up a Coinbase and exchange account in the name of the LLC. It's important that any funds only touch accounts that are set-up for the LLC. 
This approach has several advantages. 1. You retain complete control over your assets, including the keys. 2. The fees are flat ie not based on the volume of your account 3. There is a wider variety of assets you can invest in, not just Bitcoin

Weakening how? You mean due to inflation, or against other currencies?
Against other currencies, the USD has lost about 8% this year:
With regard to inflation, the consumer price index has climbed about 2% this year.
There are plenty of investments that beat 2%.

So why not just buy gold?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:10:14
Instead of asking whether BTC is in a bubble, try asking this: what is the most appropriate way to place a value on BTC?
There are several ways you can go about this.
One is to place a value on the network. This approach compares BTC to payment processors such as Visa and MasterCard, and would look at measures such as transaction volume, transaction times and dollar through-put.
Another approach is to look at mining costs (capital costs, electricity inputs) vs mining rewards (new BTC, transaction fees) and compare that against the present value of BTC. You could also forecast these costs out into the future to get an idea of what BTC would need to be worth in order to continue securing the network.

I'm not sure you're using 'inherent value' in the same way as Op.
Gold has a certain amount of intrinsic or inherent value related to its utility in the manufacture of electronics and jewelry. One feature of this value is that it's not abstract. Op is saying you can't use Bitcoin to make anything ie it's not a commodity like gold. 
You're saying Bitcoin has 'inherent value' due to its hash power? I'm not sure how I, as an owner of Bitcoin, can do anything with this hash power. Bitcoin's value is abstract and can only be unlocked by selling it.

Okay, so we've established the US doesn't have a strong dollar policy. It hasn't had one since Clinton.
But then you say: "Without the petrodollar the US can't print dollars and hyperinflation sets in."
And that's really confusing. Because you seem to argue that the US needs to be able to print dollars to avoid hyperinflation. Which is it? Does gold guard against hyperinflation or is it the Fed printing dollars?
Another thing that is confusing about your argument is that all economies are fiat now. No one runs a gold standard. 
America possessing petrodollar status doesn't seem to give it special license to print currency. A lot of central banks around the world do it and they don't have petrodollar status. Japan, for example, has been doing it for decades.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:00:18
I'm not sure. 
But I would say this: Bitcoin has run-up a 1,000% this year, but the number of transactions processed over the network have not grown by that much.
Also, mining costs have not gone up by that degree either. So I would say BTC as it's priced today has LIKELY gotten ahead of itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:32:36
Bitcoin = AOL is an analogy. It's saying one thing is like another.
If Bitcoin = the internet, then there are multiple internets at the moment eg ETH, LTC, BCH, DASH etc. 
This is why some people say blockchain = the internet.
Op's original point is that there are many coins competing in this space, just like there were many ISPs competing in the early days of the internet. And the first mover is not necessarily the winner. 
You write, "Bitcoin has far too great of a first-mover advantage to be replaced." I'm not sure why this is true. Networks die all the time (eg Myspace, Friendster). But I would be interested in hearing why you believe BTC could never be usurped.
Also, since the nodes (ie the users) on the Bitcoin network can't actually connect at the moment without enduring high transaction fees or long wait times, its meteoric rise this year would seem decoupled from the actual utility of the network. This creates an opportunity for competing networks with superior transaction times and fees.

I'm not sure there is a need for further regulation. 
The point of regulation takes place when crypto is converted to Fiat, as Fiat is the domain of government. If you sell for Fiat, the government wants to know because it wants to levy a capital gains tax.
Paper notes came into existence because they were convenient. Still, paper was backed by gold until the US went off the gold standard and Nixon finally killed Bretton Woods.
Blockchain as a technology has many advantages (eg speed, lower transaction fees). But it's not reinventing economics and doesn't hold any inherent advantage over Fiat.

Blockchain is a new technology, and as Fred Wilson likes to say, no new technology was ever built without irrational exuberance. 
There have been bubbles in the US going back to the railroads. Wild speculation helped railroads get financed and built. It's the same with blockchain. 
A lot of the investment in blockchain will be wasted. But from that excess a mature industry will emerge.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:47:50
Bitcoin is no different. All coins are the same: there are devs and miners who work via consensus and who are responsible for taking the blockchain forward.
However, among the coins, there are variations in governance structures ie the decision-making process for developing each coin.
DASH, for example, has set itself up as a decentralized autonomous organization. There is a core group that does dev work, and in theory this core group could be replaced with other devs should the Masternodes vote them out. In practice, however, DASH is criticized because there was an 'accidental' pre-mine and there is speculation the founding group controls the bulk of the Masternodes.
When choosing a coin, a question an investor should ask is: are the interests of devs, miners and coin-holders properly aligned? Or are there conflicts of interest that favor one group over another, or which can impede development?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:49:43
It is not a dumb question. Let's see: If Bitcoin were worth $1 million each, then that means all Bitcoin would be worth $21 trillion, or more than what the US economy is worth today.
Sure, it's totally possible that Bitcoin could exceed the entirety of the US economy in value.

@_date: 2017-12-10 17:07:31
Saying BTC is going to replace Fiat is one of the dumbest arguments to make.
There is a high degree of overlap between BTC backers and gold supporters who want to return to a deflationary monetary system. If such as system were worthy, we'd be back on the gold standard.
There will always be a demand for Fiat. Bitcoin and other altcoins can exist alongside Fiat, but Fiat will always be with us for one simple reason.
The government is the sole issuer of Fiat. And the government can create demand for Fiat by levying taxes and spending.
At the moment, the US economy is worth $19.7 trillion. Of that, government spending alone accounts for 36%. And because businesses and individuals must pay taxes in Fiat, they will continue to demand to be paid in Fiat.
The only places where Bitcoin can replace Fiat are failed states.

I am not sure what your point is. That the USD is somehow weak and unstable relative to other currencies?
The US didn't ask to for the petrodollar mantle. OPEC decided to use USD because USD is stable and it mitigates their risks. Oil and other commodities will continue to be settled in US dollars for one simple reason: the US is a large buyer of oil and other commodities. 
China buys a lot. But (a) RMB doesn't leave China thanks to its large surplus of USD and (b) the RMB is not fully convertible and (c) Pricing oil in RMB will just create demand for RMB and make its exports more expensive.
Which is exactly why Europe doesn't want oil priced in euros. A strong euro makes its exports less competitive.
Also, China might be buying gold but is definitely not going to base the RMB on gold ... more than 70% of its economy is still state controlled. Its banks have massive loans to state-run enterprises that don't have a hope of ever being repaid.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:22:05
I want to point out that transactions times were faster and fees lower in 2014 when I first bought BTC. Also, at the time, we were told that we had to actually spend our BTC to foster adoption. If everyone held onto their Bitcoin, the network would never grow.
As we can see, the network has grown worse. Transaction times are slow, fees are higher and you can no longer use it for small amounts. I can't think of a technology service that grows worse over time, not better. 
In my opinion, this is why a second- or third-mover will eventually win in blockchain. It's great that Bitcoin has sucked nearly $250 billion into the space, but this money will eventually find it's way into better managed blockchains.

and RMB is just another form of Fiat.

Please explain why Nixon demanded this, and what other options did oil producing nations have at the time for settling oil trade?
Not even Iran ... IRAN!!! ... can get away from using USD, even though it badly wants to settle in euros. It must be settle in USD, otherwise it exposes it's entire economy to exchange rate fluctuations.
Try this: look up the countries that have pegged their currency to the USD. Notice anything about them? I'll wait.

Nice fully articulated and well-reasoned reply. Pray tell: why do you think blockchain currencies can one day replace Fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:24:48
No. The only thing shorting does is allow you to make money on the downward movement of an asset. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:47:56
The reason why oil was settled in USD in the 70s should be obvious: it was the only global currency at the time. The euro didn't exist and Japan wasn't yet an economic powerhouse. 
All those countries in the Middle East peg their currency to USD not because the US wants them to do so ... they do it because they have to do so, because their primary source of income is in USD. 
The US doesn't care whether Iran sells oil in USD or not. But Iran can't escape the economics of it, which is why it hasn't been able to switch to euros. 
The petrodollar regime doesn't benefit the US economically. In fact, getting rid of it would help by lessening demand for dollars making US exports more competitive. 
All this is to say that the USD isn't going anywhere. There are many good reasons to invest in blockchain. Ending the Fed or replacing Fiat is not one of them.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:22:39
All my points come from how markets work.
And you're not making any sense. Let's start with something simple. Does the US currently run a strong dollar policy or not?
Also, you use phrases like, "If the US loses petrodollar status, it's dead in the water," without spelling out what you think the implications might be. What exactly would the effect on the dollar be if oil were settled in other currencies such as euros?

No. If you go through them one by one, you would see Bitcoin doesn't address the risk factors listed in the report.
How is Bitcoin meant to address North Korea ( or the Mueller investigation ( or mid-terms ( 19-25 are also political factors. 
How is Bitcoin meant to address higher commodity prices ( which are cyclical?
How is Bitcoin meant to address housing bubbles (27-29)?
