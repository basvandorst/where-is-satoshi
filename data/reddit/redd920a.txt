If you have sold and packed your bags than please leave :-)
The way you are lurking around this forum still means that you are still greedy and want to make money.

No man, trust me I also did the same thing at that same time and I am happy because my bitcoin value is still the same.
My friends also purchased bitcoin at that time and their BTC became quite low, they were making small gains and than they lost a lot. I believe whales makes people happy by giving some small amouts and then they take it back with interest :/
So I will say that we are still good till the price is more than 5k$.

My suggestion is if you have more funds than wait for sometime and buy if the market goes down. Else be satisfied with what you have :)

From HOLDER perspective, even my mobile and devices that show prices are also hurting.
