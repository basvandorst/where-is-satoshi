147 companies own 40% of all the shares of 43,060 largest global companies ... they own the press. Reuters will send out a sound bite on scandal all will give it some mention and forget it the next hour. GE and Westinghouse (the military industrial complex) each own around 25 of the major news outlets i.e.; NBC, ABC, CNBC, CNN etc. Why are people just figuring this out obviously they don't care about their children or grand parents because that is who is going to be paying for this ponzi scheme.

My belief is an inside job lead by Mark. Many warned him including me to improve security and he did not. I told him he was aiding and abetting but he ignored. I believe he has many of the coins and we will be able to strip him of all his un-hidden assets via law suits from his other holdings. I also have been told by lawyers they have insider information (whistle blower) coming with latest settlement via Jed McCaleb. My coins got hacked in May 2013 from Taiwan and we know Mark has connections there as well. Mark will end up making a deal by offering some more coins to reduce heat on him. This is serious and his life is most likely on the line as well as big jail time.

No I don't think it will negatively inpact it.  In fact all news is good news at this early stage of bitcoin when so much learning needs to be done including how to protect your bitcoins.

Bitcoin is not a coin it is software/protocol just like operating software people pay money for it because they can use it. I call it a contract software program that is open source, in other words the community have to agree in order to make programming changes.
So right now the algorithm is set to section off the software into 21 million pieces mined over the next 125 years which people have coined a coin or bitcoin. Those pieces or software codes (coins) are transferred to each other like a stock certificate (digital) and can even have actual contract documents attached and this section/piece or encrypted coin is confirmed on the blockchain or in accounting language a ledger. Currently, this ledger is confirmed by 100,000+ computers every 10 minutes of who owns what piece/section or coin and adding computers daily as people join. To build a current similar system it would cost you 100,000 computers (say $100 million dollars). That in itself puts value on those sections/coins but also the electricity it took to date to build should also be counted as value/effort. That is just to point out the physical cost of the system what really gives it its value is the uses.
Currently the best use is digital payments via like Paypal. Since Paypal is ripping people off (in my opinion) charging 1-3% at each end while bitcoin is almost free. That and extremely large online retailers like Overstock.com and Tigerdirect.com has created big demand.
Lets talk the bank scandals like libor and foreign exchange; traders are being investigated for skimming or floating the $5 Trillion (with a T) dollars per day in FX. Either to skim some or delaying its movement to leverage it by 10 times. To digress people are currently using bitcoin to do their foreign exchange and again for almost free!
Those are valuable uses. Yes bitcoin is getting a lot of coverage because of its almost anonymous structure allowing shady folks to use it like the announcement that the largest porn site in the world now accepts bitcoin. Remember when we used 14400 baud modems on the internet well back then 50% of all internet traffic was porn, I am just bringing it up as people seem to want to pay anonymously for those types of things and it is huge demand. Let alone people just don't want their money telling people what they spent on (like credit cards do).
There are so many other uses besides coins like property management i.e.; land titles could be stored on the ledger and confirmed by the 100,000+ people.
The Chicago Times is experimenting with micro payments which cannot happen with credit cards as they charge a minimum and bitcoin allows for .25 cents per news clip or tipping. Wait until Netflix figures out they can add another 100 countries to their 40+ with pay per view to those that cannot afford $8 month but can afford .25 cents per movie (once a month) paying with their phones and not even having bank account.
My favorite bitcoin info google+:
Intrinsic (belonging naturally) value is a very wrong term. Nothing has value in itself, value is subjective, humans value things and from the sum of all evaluations come market price of this good.
Lets say i'll offer you one gallon of water or one pound of gold, which one will you chose? I think all of us will chose gold. But what what will you chose if you are in the middle of the desert?

I believe him and his friends in Taiwan had other bitcoin info sites and they looked for matching user names and passwords to rip off extra cash to float the million dollar lifestyle.  Intrigue, fantasy and fun just like the card game they played and traded.  He became a real life character and probably thinks he will still live happily ever after.  It was 100 bitcoins.

Lots of folks don't pay the fines.  Personally I would never get a business licence until my business was established as I don't call it a business until it is working as such.  The gov't has ways of dealing with those who don't pay fines like not renewing your drivers licence or you can't get car insurance etc. when you owe to the gov't.  They can even put liens on your car or home.

I just find our economy has been taken over by big business.  I am a businessman that has done my own books for 30 years and would call myself an expert bookkeeper.  When I heard Jeff Skilling got the US Treasurer to change accounting practices to reflect Mark to Market I almost fell out of my chair (Jeff is serving a prison sentence and yet that law is still on the books).  Also, when I heard of short selling same thing - made my guts sick.  Now they are able to gamble with derivatives ($100 Trillion worth) mostly futures contracts (i.e.; betting on the future with pensioners money).

Bitcoin currently is extremely deflationary as 25 new coins created every 10 minutes.  Announcements such as Microsoft are fighting that deflation and other such announcements will continue to throughout 2015.  In my opinion, it will be 2016 when only 12.5 coins are created every 10 minutes and combined with more mainstream use is when we will see very rapid price appreciation.

No nothing to worry about. Zero interest rates started the loss of free market price discovery. $6-7 trillion printed 2008-2014 – Fed partial audit says it was $16T given to banks. Printed money moved to buying mortgage back securities losing free market price discovery. Banks fined billions and billions in the last year for market rigging in LIBOR, FX, Metals, and HFT front running trades. Stock market took 85 years to get to 8,500 and in 6 years during zero interest and printing money moved an additional 8,500 points losing again free market price discovery. No true free market price discovery in Interest, Housing, Stock Market, Metals and Bond Market.

Lets pretend banks are allowed not to have insurance (like bitcoin now) and they don't protect your money from fraud (i.e.; only lock front door and not use vault) they would be found liable in court for not doing their due diligence the customer putting money in that bank would not be found liable for using their service.

I believe we are going to see one of the big companies probably a bank take a run at aquiring as many bitcoins as it can to dominate the new transferring of wealth mechanisms.  Facebook just bought Whatapps for $12B almost double of all bitcoins worth today.  Why not apple spending some of their $100Billion on it to dominate the payment platform or US Postal Service having 43000 locations with current bank licences woud be another perfect corporation to take a run at owning most bitcoins.  Mark my words!

ATM's are $12K to $20K and the Vancouver one paid that back within 45 days.  Main regulation is to 'know the customer' and even though Canada does not insist on that for current bitcoin ATM's the Vancouver ATM is doing it anyway so very doable for WU if their regs call for it.

I believe China's banks do business a lot different than Western banks.  In other words, they would be inclinded to introduce new services (i.e.; trading Bitcoin) and wait for authorities to tell them not to, as what happened.  In the west the banks here don't introduce new services without knowing they are allowed by regulators.  So I doubt the government would tell our banks not to trade Bitcoins when they are not doing it and until Bitcoin gets large enough probably have no desire to.  The only way I think we would see a big drop is if government said businesses were not allowed to use Bitcoin in the name of National Security.  Bitcoin is not near large enough for that and once it is large it would probably not be politically correct to do it as too many voters would hold Bitcoins.

This withdrawal delay will stop some Yuan from fleeing into Seattle real-estate. But it now gives the Chinese (reminds, educates) permission for them to move their money into BTC and hold long. The Chinese are moving record amounts of money into overseas properties to avoid devaluation of the Yuan (Gov't pretends it's money laundering for control).

I think creditors are a different group than the customers.  They are like operating expense suppliers (i.e.; rent, wages, etc.).  The courts will determine who gets first claim of assets.  So the customers could get screwed again if the court deems creditors are to be paid first - hopefully the other way around because technically M T Gox was holding those assets in trust but unfortunatly on the cash side he had a common bank account I believe.  The coins therefore might be safe and go directly to customers pro rated.

I am Canadian and used MtGox as they were the low cost provider .5% and the Canadian exchange Virtex was 3%.  Now Virtex is 1.5% and say their volume has allowed lower fees but are not the low cost provider because they want to ensure fast customer service for deposit and withdrawals.  I am impressed with their direct withdrawal system to get them funds.  I will most likely use them in the next few weeks. I was also impressed with Canadian firm Vault of Satoshi as they have mandatory dual authentication.  I got ripped off two times at MtGox so they for the masses (non geeks) mandatory dual auth is coming via regulations so exchanges should be ahead of that.  I love bitcoin and will be buying soon.  I was part of the $400 million missing and it has taken awhile to regroup, move stocks around, get taxes back and open new accounts.  Bitcoin is a low cost financial provider and this world needs that big time.  All low cost providers win market share!  Bitcoin will impress and shock people on its future success so so what if there are asshole operators like MtGox Mark Karpeles.  There will always be good operators and most Canadian businesses follow rule of law and I give two big thumbs up to Virtex for being extremely professional.  Good luck!

This is so true.  I have been on this mind set for a long time now.  I think it may be happening in a way right now as China's (PBOC) is all over the exchanges right now.  I have read they are getting some of the exchanges to re license into banks. Since the Chinese gov't owns a share in all big business in China I think they are moving in and will be partners in these new exchange banks.  I see China declaring a currency war against the USA if Trump does anything to piss them off.  China has announced they want to be very digital within 2.5 years.  China could back their currency the Yuan with gold and encourage all companies within China to use BTC as a payment platform.  This would Trump the USA and crash the US dollar and their citizens would ride the wave up in BTC.

The biggest players are going to join bitcoin because the elite don't care about the banks even though they are big shareholders they have more assets outside of banking and they can't wait to make the banks blow up so they can short the other side and make more money then their shares are worth.  Bitcoin is here to stay!﻿  The new tag line "here to stay" read it and weep.

This is exactly my thoughts for a long time now as price always goes back up.  Some big player/s is moving in whenever the dip shows up.  Wait until other countries or banks think the same...big money is coming to BTC (I am long and doing great)  as no one can trust anyone!

I have transferred money many times and believe it within myself I needed the banks permission even if it was just to use their transfer system in fact they grossly overcharged (ripped me off blindly) $30 from me to do it.  IMO the banks have wasted at least 10% of GDP globally for the last 100 years - that could have saved a lot of starving people.

IMO, whoever has the most processing power and is decentralized will win.  Bitcoin is light years ahead today.

People sure get confused.  FACT:
Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering Laws have nothing to do with war on drugs or terrorism.  It is so the governments and banks can control where the money is and inflate it away as a tax.  
This withdrawal delay will stop some Yuan from fleeing into Seattle real-estate. But it now gives the Chinese (reminds, educates) permission for them to move their money into BTC and hold long.  The Chinese are moving record amounts of money into overseas properties to avoid devaluation of the Yuan (Gov't pretends it's money laundering for control).  Chinese can move to BTC legally IN ANY AMOUNT (no 50K limit) and hold, then move back after Yuan devaluations.  These sudden and stupid moves from the PBOC are excellent eduction and publicity for BTC on the long term.  The PBOC looks like they will become partners with the exchanges as they re-register as banks not exchanges, this is in order that the gov't does not lose out on all the upside going to be coming in BTC through heated currency wars and global economic turmoil.  You are going to see BTC double or triple in value soon.  The big money will see the moves and not want to miss out. No one trusts each other - hence that is why BTC exists.

So many people don't have a clue like this author.  Firstly, yes IMO it is very unlikely that bitcoin will ever be any major countries currency as they will want more control than it offers.  Simply what it is is TRUST.  That is it the trust of a ledger (journal - set of books) via computational verification.  That is it!  And since we do not trust PEOPLE, GOV"T or COUNTRIES we need this BIG TIME.  All bitcoin is is an AUDIT trail that is near impossible to break ($6.5 billion dollars solid today).  The earth needs this type of AUDIT a computational audit via processing power and it is here to stay with or without you liking it. So should you want to protect your wealth over the long haul you should put your money into the token that is keeping this most incredible technology strong.  Once again, I repeat from before the bitcoin blockchain is validating one ledger with more processing power then has ever been put together for one single purpose in the HISTORY OF MAN. Get over it.

Most won't let you use debit or prepaid visa card because buying bitcoin is not like buying from a retailer whereas charge backs and fraud can be off set by third parties or by higher prices for the goods in the future.  Buying bitcoin is like buying money.  Try buying USD, CAD or any other currency online not too easy either.  I along with most people in the world use  and the many options available there to buy bitcoin without too much set up delays.

I was paid $23,000 for BTC to my ATB (Alberta Treasury Branch) with hacked e-transferred funds and the bank said I was liable as I had they said signed an agreement that said any 'fraud funds' into my account were my liability. Lucky I had already withdrawn the money but they insisted I pay up, I said show me that agreement as I am sure my lawyer will want to review.  They never billed me or showed me the agreement but they did immediately close my $20K line of credit and closed my personal account.  Been almost 2 yrs so I assume they ate that one as it was their bank e-transfer that was not secure.  ATB said they did not want to deal with bitcoin accounts too risky.  I asked CIBC if I could do a bitcoin business with them they said no.  I was trading in my personal TD account and the manager called on a Sunday evening and said stop and took my $5K line of credit away.  
I also got hacked at MtGox for 100BTC and lost 7.2BTC when they closed.  Suit pending.  I continue to trade bitcoin and pretty much have all my loses back and have been frauded a few other times like $400, $1400, $660.  I have buckled down the hatches (dual authentication) and don't blame the technology at all.  It is here to stay: I am fascinated by algorithmic protocol that uses cryptographic hashes &amp; public key cryptography to reward participants with another protocol that retains value called bitcoin for validating a ledger called the blockchain on a peer to peer decentralized transparent public network you don't have to trust.﻿ 
The banks need to engage in this technology and learn it by working with subject matter experts like BTC traders as it will be a great big win win for the world and if they don't they will be eaten alive like cell phones wiping out land lines.

I think a lot of people will choose to stay in bitcoin all those who don't trust gov't and know about rigging and inflating the money away to pay for aircraft carriers - so I would say the price would stay solid and most likely go up.  Coins like Ether may be used for the gov't to put a side chain coin like Fedcoin and have more control on the sidechain coin and even have big influence with the Ether foundation as men can be bought.

Could be a pump and dump as I suspect.  In other words, an exchange wants to trigger the buy and sell orders for commissions so they buy tons and create a wave of excitement and news with new comers as well.

I think people don't get why this is important as they keep pointing to general purpose computing etc.  The processing is all about security and only security.  So it is a big deal that this amount of processing makes the most secure processing in the HISTORY OF MAN!  It is all about trust and or auditing a ledger.  Bitcoin is not a currency it is a token given as a reward for securing the most valuable ledger ever invented.  This will become as important to business as the computer has been.

@_date: 2016-06-29 18:54:47
If bitcoin goto overstock.com and spend away immediately.  If ETH go onto Krakan and exchange for BTC and then do same.  You can also buy prepaid master-cards with BTC so you can spend everywhere.  Then you can sell some for cash on Krakan and transfer to your bank and go from there for bigger purchases.
@_date: 2017-01-19 22:39:32
You are correct if you are caring about the electricity usage.  I only care about the security of the ledger.  I don't care if it uses more or less power than 500 super computers.  I know it uses less power than our legacy banking system and that is fine with me on power usage concerns.  I am more into the debate on processing power for security and on that note it has 50000x more security than 500 super computers.

I agree ZeroHedge has lots of learning to do when it comes to BTC.  In fact, I think they maybe playing us because they are so highly skilled with economics that I suspect something.  They say in many articles that China could make exchanges not allow customers to send BTC out of country.  That is also BS as BTC once purchased is automatically global and not FIAT anymore.

A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.

I could take a job and work 40 hrs a week to pay for a place to sleep but I have done that enough and I also get mad having to pay to sleep hence the van and besides some gas to move it it is essentially almost free to sleep.  I have studied finance and bitcoin in detail and a family of 6 in my opinion will do real good in the long term by diversifying any assets to include bitcoin held long term.  Thx, by learning about community money (bitcoin) you too have joined the revolution!

Not to mention micorpayments in pay per movie or songs...hang on for the ride.  It will also take out around 50% of the cost of all finance globally  - currently a true waste that could feed people.

Thanks for comment.  I am sure alt coins and blockchains will provide a service but what will appeal to the masses is who can offer 'trust'.  For 30 days in Sept 2008 central banks (mostly private) did not trust each other and shut down the over night lending.  They had a chat and decided to wipe out Lehman and Bear Stearn's. Since then they printed a bunch of currency (hidden tax) to save the other banks.  Those banks own 40% of IBM and have been fined over 300 billion for fraud in the last 2-3 years.  147 companies own 60% voting power on behalf of 43,000 transnational corporations. Such a structure can align the interests of the group members and make them behave as a single economic “super-entity”, with implications for market competition and financial systemic risk.
In my opinion it all boils down to 'trust' and I believe that german Deutsche bank is currently insolvent and will be many times bigger of a problem then 2008.  So the owners above will be building big printing presses (not to mention Japan and EU printing a trillion per year right now) when this happens people will lose 'trust' in fiat currencies and the best alt will be peer to peer trust-less blockchain tech.  Please understand the word "trust" and decentralization ensures that!
I am fascinated by an open source, algorithmic protocol that uses cryptographic hashes &amp; public key cryptography, to reward participants with another protocol, that retains value (bitcoin/token/satoshi/microbit), for validating a ledger called the blockchain, on a peer to peer decentralized transparent network.﻿

The use of the word 'trust' by me is this: Yes AI gets rid of the need of trust as what I am saying is banks do not trust each other, countries do not trust each other, businesses do not trust each other and people do not trust each other so a new unneeded trust has been invented with decentralized peer to peer blockchain technology.
@_date: 2015-09-30 01:26:08
...but kinda a matter of semantics:
The bitcoin mining network is powered by ASICs that have one purpose - hashing. You are saying that because the chips only do one thing (hashing), that it doesn't count as a measure of computing power (because it isn't general purpose).
This isn't really the case, because computing is "any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating algorithmic processes", which includes the algorithmic process of hashing.
For example, one can say that this difference engine has some measure of computing power, even though it can only find the solutions of polynomial equations. If a trillion trillion of these were all networked together in some way, the network they form would have more computing power that has ever been put together for one purpose in the history of man.

One would measure the Bitcoin mining network in FLOPS to make it easy to compare its computing power to the computing power of other networks, which is very commonly measured in FLOPS. The measure is an estimate converted from the network's hash rate. Bitcoinwatch.com's derivation is outlined in this thread on the topic: 
At the time the thread was made, most mining was done with GPUs which actually can do floating point operations. This, along with other measures, helped people compare cards used for mining.
Google's _general purpose_ compute capacity trumps the Bitcoin network's, and the Bitcoin network's hash digest compute capacity trumps Google's. But the Bitcoin network's computing capacity completely destroys Google's, and all other supercomputers'.

Yes that is the problem you have to trust people to apply properly and they will not.  Once again, in Sept 2008 central banks did not lend overnight to each other for 30 days as they did not trust each other.  Central Banks are privately owned companies so we know it is fact companies don't trust each other, countries don't trust each other (QE) and people don't trust each other and should not have to with "real" accounting and the new blockchain.  Thanks for your comments and don't take my passion for this personal.  You are very up to speed.

Start with Wikipedia it is an excellent read.  Make sure you understand 2 factor authentication (like the person below says).   I was hacked and lost 100 bitcoins.  The exchange Bitstamp automatically gives you 2 factor authentication while the exchange MtGox does not.  I also like the localcoins.com for small amounts and if you do that make sure you buy the coins in a public place.
