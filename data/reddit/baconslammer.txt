well, ok - since you *demanded...*  let's just pull the plug, boys!
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:45:20
Thanks. We only put in what we were capable of losing, anything from here on out will have to be mined. Even if it doesn't bring any real income, I really believe in bitcoin and still want to contribute to the network. Proud to be a part of it. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:20:32
Precisely my point. She's over it, now. 
What was once a revolution has been reduced to tossing dice in the alley with the boys, in her eyes. All she sees is crypto-currency and a colossal hole in her savings account, put there by me and my inability to heed warnings. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:36:27
You know, I didn't expect so much criticism -- but what really surprised me was the level of support that I received.  It does help to talk about it.  The anonymity of Reddit makes it easy to share my business without having to actually share my business -- thanks for not judging me.
Have a good one.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:18:43
I must have left something out of what I said, originally -- 
Marriage is fine, all decisions were made as a team -- any new coins will come from mining, at work, where electricity is free and employer is fully aware of said mining rig -- and that it also performs legitimate work for...work.
But thanks for taking the time to write.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:58:25
All the joy of mugging people for physical cash without any of the messy legal stuff.  Love this.
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:44:53
White noise machine, will help you sleep at night.
...unless you'd previously converted your wife's life savings to bitcoins and were trading them on MtGox.  Kiss sleep goodbye.  
But hey, at least she doesn't understand how it all works or what is going on, right?  As long as she doesn't need the money for anything anytime soon...like an upcoming trip.
TL;DR - sell for plane tickets to visit family in NY for Easter.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:43:42
Ah, I suppose I left out a critical detail -- it is my wife's money. I am the sole breadwinner but she had this money left over from when she was a kid (gift from grandparents - $8,500 remaining/down the drain). 
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:03:19
Amen to that. I don't count on getting the coins back, though. :/
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:50:36
100% my fault, I won't argue with you there.  Haven't lied at all - I let her know as soon as Gox stopped withdrawals and kept her updated every step of the way. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:40:14
True. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:47:40
Thanks, stranger -- the thought alone is enough, and appreciated!  Thanks for stopping by.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:45:33
Yeah, it's a good site for MtGox.  doesn't show you anything else (at least not in such detail -- he did put a little ticker up top that shows other exchanges.)

"President error of failure"
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:33:50
Ouch. Yeah - same situation here. She was fine with the losses -- but a total loss, despite it being something we were prepared to lose, was a big turn-off for her. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:17:34
Right ;)

Nailed it. The claim image is key. Logged in on my phone just to deliver upvote. Bravo. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:06:27
We'll be fine in that regard, but our savings took a pretty big hit. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:32:29
Don't think I won't!  :) I'm more upset by the fact that my cheerleading will fall on deaf ears. I used to talk about all the stuff that was happening with bitcoin at dinner - legislation, new businesses accepting it, etc - and now she just gets upset. She'll move past it eventually, but I was really enjoying being a part of this. Here. Now. 
History.  you know?
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:18:01
it's a trap!
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:44:37
Well, I wouldn't say that "I" invested it so much as "we" invested it.  
And honey, there's nothing unproven about Bitcoin -- it's solid, it isn't going anywhere.  
My ability to heed warnings, not so much.  Definitely needs work.  0/10.
It's not about making her whole -- we wouldn't have invested it if we weren't ready to lose it all.  
We make all decisions together -- there is no going behind her back, because you're right -- that's a one way ticket to die-alone-ville.  
Sorry, I don't mean to be so insensitive about that.  In any case, thanks for taking the time to write!
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:11:05
It sucks.  It does.  Pay no attention to the trolls.  You have your family - your legacy.  You have each other.  
This too shall pass.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:22:29
who said she didn't want to invest?  this is a decision we made together.  the money was just sitting in an investment account, losing value.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:38:11
if you want to say it respectfully then don't say anything, troll.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:50:57
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:30:54
Thanks.  And you are right -- this is 100% on me.  Bitcoin has a bright future - huge fan, always will be.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:50:55
Right - thank you.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:59:36
hahaha -- man, you are right.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:34:37
my income is the only income we have, and we have it budgeted out for bills + saving.  This was extra money that was just sitting there (and, again, losing money in poorly managed set-and-forget investments from years ago) and we decided to take a chance with it based on other success I'd had with selling (and later buying back) coins mined from ASICs.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:03:23
Well said. Thanks, stranger. :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:22:52
Nothing was done behind her back -- sorry if I gave that impression.  I wrote a lot of these replies late last night.  
We have since talked about it and have agreed that we put in only as much as we were willing to lose, and unfortunate though it may be (while 100% of my own doing, unrelated to the viability of bitcoin), we lost it all.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:06:26


well, that lead to an interesting read:
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:11:27
That's sweet.  I appreciate all the attention you've given to my comment.  Your time is valuable!
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:10:45
...fully...disclosed?  Read my comment again, poindexter.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:45:36
I make all the money, but this money happened to be hers. $8,500 saved from when she was a kid -- down the drain. 100% my fault for leaving it in Gox, though. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:28:15
It was the sound of the fans on my mining rig starting back up.  
Nothing is done behind her back, because you're right -- it's a great way to have some high heels come in hot for a landing in your groin.
I appreciate the sentiment, though - thanks for writing!
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:12:47
It wouldn't be reddit without a few trolls, would it?  Thanks for the entertainment - have a nice day.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:21:28
Big risk, big reward -- and apart from this, I truly believe in bitcoin -- in the long term, it will only increase in value.  We were (and still are) prepared to lose it all -- didn't put in a cent over what we were willing to kiss goodbye.  This doesn't mean we'll be happy with it (especially my wife) -- we just aren't surprised.  I kick myself for leaving it in Gox, because bitcoin will still be fine in the end.  I should have pulled it out.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:51:15
interesting point re: helping the network.  I will look into that.  thanks!!

@_date: 2014-02-25 10:02:34
Indeed - lesson painfully learned!
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:10:19
The fault is 100% my own. I knew better. And I do truly believe in it. 
You're right - thanks. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:51:25
If I'm an idiot for endlessly coming back to bitcoin, then fine.  It's the future - a game changer.  I've never been more proud to be a moron -- I'm in such great company!
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:08:20
You know, she really did.  Well, since you mentioned it...
I hand-made her Valentine's day card again this year - and brought her flowers the night before V-day so she'd get the best of what the florist had on-hand...not just whatever they had left on my way home from work.  Two dozen, white and red.
While not something I do every weekend, I cleaned the house this past weekend while she was out shopping -- actually moved all the furniture so I could get under couches and end-tables -- and then took our young (toddler) daughter to a movie so she could have some time to herself with a cup of tea and a book in her perfectly clean, clutter-free house.
She doesn't have to work, I make a pretty comfortable living, we have great medical insurance and I've been employed by the same company for over a decade.
I don't drink or smoke.  I still jog ahead to open the car door when we're going out.  I tell her how beautiful she is at least once a week and tell her I love her every night as I'm coming to bed.
I'm not terribly religious, but I give thanks for these blessings daily, right before bed -- without fail -- because not everyone is so lucky.  I know this.  I'm humbled by it.  
I'm an extraordinarily lucky guy to have someone like her.  If you haven't already, I hope you find this kind of happiness someday -- there's nothing like it. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:05:07
I'm here to keep up with what's going on in the bitcoin community -- to see who has most recently adopted it as a payment method, to hear about ways people are using it and to stay abreast of anything I might need to know re: the protocol.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:20:17
Yes, I'm the asshole.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:23:19
If only it were that easy. Every penny is budgeted. Still, you're right - I'll find a way, somehow.

Happy Cakeday!  Have some bacon!
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:25:27
Yeah.  She knew we might lose it -- wouldn't have agreed to put it there otherwise.  Still pretty rough.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:06:16
And a daughter, too. :) 
Point taken. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:11:21
It's true!
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:39:40
Yeah, I might.  Thanks. :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:47:11
Back at ya. And I said the same things. Fingers crossed. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:04:09
Completely agree.  Thanks for writing.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:15:41
I don't know where everyone is getting this behind-her-back thing...I've left a lot of comments on this issue, and if I've lead anyone to believe that I'm sneaking around behind my wife's back, I'm sorry -- because I'm not.  but regardless, this (mining) isn't really something that you sneak around with.   
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:58:46
All solid points.  And this is 100% my fault for leaving it there in the first place. 
I was pretty clear about past volatility - it doesn't change this from being a rough experience or the fact that it will generate bad publicity among the general non-technical populace, who won't understand that this is limited to a specific exchange -- all they'll see is "massive sum of money lost, bitcoin must be bad."  had it been the stock market, she'd probably want to stay away from that, too. 
The money ($8,500) was all hers, saved from when she was a kid. She trusted me with it. Bitcoin didn't fail her, Gox didn't fail her - I failed her by leaving it there when I knew I should have kept it in cold storage. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:01:55
Thank you, sir. :) Hey, if they turn trading back on, I'm all for it - I made a couple of coins today selling right as the news broke and buying back in near the bottom. Fingers crossed. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:31:41
Yes, yes I did.  This one is squarely on me.  I own it.  I fucked up.  Period.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:01:16
Edit 3:  Wow, that's a lot of negativity.  I'd try explaining again, but trolls are going to be trolls.
There have been a handful of people who have been supportive, and I am grateful for that.
At the end of the day, our marriage is fine, my wife and I are happy, we're fine with this happening because we would never invest more than we were willing to lose, and life goes on.  It wasn't our only investment, it was our only investment in bitcoin.  And yeah, I fucked up.  The original post was written just as we found out that Gox had pulled the plug.  I didn't come here to complain or try to get my money back -- the OP asked how much people had lost and I shared my story.
But, really -- I'm thrilled that so many of you decided to put so much energy into judging a complete stranger.  I'm touched.  
And again, to those of you who offered something positive -- I thank you, sincerely.  It's nice to see that people will take the time to say something positive when clearly, it is all too easy to spew hatred under the protection of anonymity.  
Original post:
About 14 coins. And it happens to be the last 14 coins my wife will ever let me invest in bitcoin. She wants nothing to do with it now. Not for investing, not for spending -- nothing. And it's a damned shame. 
I love how all the other bitcoin companies got together to say that their money was safe. Did they think that would help people like me?  Do they think my wife cares?  
I love this community - I've been an evangelist since the early days - but no amount of guarantees or proof of solvency is ever going to win her trust back. And it kills me - because I know I'm not the only one who will be affected in this way. 
Edit: spacing 
Edit 2: let me reiterate that this is my fault, not MtGox's. 
And let me add that this was her money, from her savings acct. $8,500 gone. 
And finally: I'm pretty surprised/humbled by the response from + Redditors in general. This sucks, no one in my offline life really understands, and I appreciate the comments. You guys are alright. :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:25:02
No, she knows I have a rig and that I plan to use it to mine. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:25:29
The .com bubble was a wild ride indeed -- 10/10, would do again.  
(Would spend $30M+ in VC a little differently, however!  You know, maybe not run so many full page ads in the WSJ...and skip the billboard over by JFK.)
You live and you learn!
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:19:40
It's a little clunky (doesn't work at all on Winkdex, for example), but you can go to the Data tab and hit that second button from the left, "From Web".  Enter the website, hit "Go", pick the table you want and you are all set.  Then just point to the cell that ends up containing the number you want (in the case where you have to grab a giant table that contains more than just the number you want).  It doesn't work correctly with bitcoinaverage.com (shows the wrong price for some reason) but I didn't spend much time on it, may have done something wrong.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:25:57
The families of the people impacted by this will not care about your words of encouragement. I appreciate them - I sincerely do -- but what little we had as a family (and it wasn't much, &lt; 15 BTC) was lost. My wife will never trust it again. It kills me. And ultimately, it's my fault for leaving the coins there. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:12:05
ha.  hey, I only run USB block erupters.  2.5w apiece x 18 sticks, plus 3 USB hubs @ 15w each = 90 watts total.  it isn't nothing, but it isn't spinning the meter off the building, either.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:11:39
Ouch. I feel your pain. The only person I haven't told is my father-in-law, who was quick to tell me this was all a Ponzi scheme when I first told him about it years ago. 
Oh, the irony...self inflicted though it may be..
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:33:55
I don't think the OP wanted to debate the long-term viability of bitcoin or its worth as an investment vehicle.  No one is forcing you to get on this bus...but rest assured, it will get to where it is going.
I am happy.  And I'm grateful for that.  Not everyone can be happy.
Thanks for writing.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:27:21
That's sweet of you to say. Thanks - I think I'll sleep a little better tonight. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:18:33
buddy, if I could get my coins out of there, I would...but I can't...so I'm just rolling with it, trying to pick up some cheap coins as others panic.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:44:41
Coinbase is probably the easiest way to turn dollars into bitcoins, imo.  Exchanges require KYC (so does Coinbase, but not quite as much, and only if you want to buy more than the default limit, I think).

@_date: 2014-02-25 18:30:37
Sweetheart - I sincerely appreciate your concern.  Honestly.  Putting that kind of effort into a complete stranger like me -- it's worth something.  The occasional steaming pile of hatred can really make you appreciate what you have + how you try to live your life.  So, thank you.
...but I said "fully disclosed."  And I should add, it isn't just here mining all day.  It serves legitimate work functions as well.  But I've made no bones about the fact that I am making a direct profit from their electricity.  Can't afford to mess around at work -- jobs aren't too easy to come by these days.  They know, they don't care - and I even kick back a few mBTC/Doge now and again.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:27:56
My own damned fault, ultimately. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:20:22

Thanks, Bob!  Very nice of you. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:38:37
It was meant to be funny - glad you laughed.  The amount I kick back works out to a round of Starbucks for our team every other month at best.  A gesture, relatively worthless though it may be.  I'm just glad they allow it.

ah, see - that's what happens when you multitask :) -- sorry for the mis-read.
In my limited understanding of the retail side, refunds are processed at whatever the going market price is at a given point in time.  Some retailers (like Overstock) choose to give refunds in the form of store credit.

Anyway -- I'm going to go step out in front of a bus now, be back in a few!  Thanks again!
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:22:35
yeah, man -- enough with the fear mongering.  Shouldn't you be thumping a bible somewhere?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:19:28
Clearly, I have failed at explaining the situation.  The OP asked how much I lost, I was upset at the time and may not have been as coherent as I should have been in my conveyance of said losses.  I've gone back and tried to clarify things with follow-up comments elsewhere in this thread.  
In any case, I do appreciate your time and effort - thanks for commenting.
@_date: 2013-09-18 11:21:42
yeah.  "mining the miners" is a phrase I keep seeing...
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:50:44
According to my numbers, if you got your new ASIC this Friday, 10/25/13, when the difficulty is expected (by BTCMon, anyway) to be 379,366,105 - and the avg period between difficulty changes was 12 days, went up no more than 25%, and BTC was priced at $195, you could spend up to $14.88/GH and potentially break even in 180 days.  Seems like everything on eBay is priced at 2x this.
My numbers say:
ASICMINER Block erupter (0.335 GH) - $4.98 max
BFL Jalepeno 5 GH Miner - $74.39 max
BFL Jalepeno 6 GH Miner - $89.27 max
BFL Jalepeno 7 GH Miner - $104.15 max
BFL Jalepeno 8 GH Miner - $119.02 max
BFL Little Single 25 GH Miner - $371.95 max
BFL Little Single 30 GH Miner - $446.34 max
BFL Single 50 GH Miner - $743.90 max
BFL Single 60 GH Miner - $892.67 max
These numbers are ultra-super generous - probably still too high given the unpredictable future of the network hashrate.  (Friday's increase will be over 40% from current, for example)..
EDIT:  this assumes electricity is free...
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:24:52

Yeah, I agree -- it isn't worth letting the money sit.  BFL fooled me once...I guess it'll be on me if it happens again!
