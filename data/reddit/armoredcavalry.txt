Not sure if you are just joking... but Akamai is one of, if not the, largest CDN on the internet. They serve about 30% of the internet traffic out there (according to Wikipedia).
So... it really means nothing that MtGOX and some government agencies both use it. You'll notice even on the customer list you posted, there are a huge amount of big corporations that use it.

Yeah this is why I decided to post it here. I really don't understand why people would actively NOT want an additional payment method.
How can more options be a bad thing? Are people going to be confused from adding one more payment method at checkout?

Yeah, but in that case why not just -

Then your password has literally just become the hashed password... (gone full circle). You're really not adding any extra security with the method you describe.

I just checked this out and it says the Amazon 'vouchers' expire after 12 months. I thought Amazon gift cards never expire?

They told me the exact same thing when I emailed them. Back before I stopped using it months ago, haha.

Seriously, they still haven't fixed that yet? I stopped using the service over 6 months ago due to that problem. Was literally impossible to get an order fulfilled for me.
I don't understand why they don't give you an option to manually block buyers that don't have positive feedback...

Can you explain how this is possible please?
