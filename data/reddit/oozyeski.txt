I'm British but have a Spanish level of at least a 6 or 7/10 haha. I have property in each mentioned country and as such,  spend 6 months in England and 6 in Spain, yearly. 
Main point, it sounds alien to me. Are you from America? Talking (mexican) Spanish?

That's brilliant. Shitcoin Club owns the machine?!

Unfortunately no. I have seen these before in other countries though. Very surprised to find it in somewhere like Murcia.

Spanish, not Portuguese, uncle.

To even have a machine like that here in Spain and especially Malaga is pretty impressive. 
I keep telling the cannabis association/clubs here to get a machine in and also accept payment in Crypto.

You have no idea on his personal financial situation nor his location. Huge factors. Imagine he hails from Albania. Life will made in a few years, no mortgage on a new hut!!

Straight away? Why do you have a delay? Are you unverified on coinbase?

Start an ISA. Buy some BTC and hodl for now. Learn to trade and understand the realm of markets more. It's incredible at 16 you have the desire to invest and even ask such a question. Start compounding regular markets and hodl now and you are way ahead of the game!

New money initially enters BTC and while they learn about the mistake to make next (ie watching youtube idiots) the initial entry as above is BTC thus growing. So any new money from today,  bumps BTC first and foremost. 
Hopefully in the face of fatf guidelines, this potentially could be the shtcoin culling.

How long have you had it up and how many tips so far? Just curious to see usage rate. Good idea tbh.

These newbie questions excite me. Zero sum n all.

You will take this lesson like a man due to the values lost (it's a harder lesson). But you will never make it again. All the positives.

Where is the property?
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:43:11
Degenerate time frame.

All in is the most stupid concept known to man. It's about staying sustainable and viable. One of investors biggest mistakes tends to be investing more than they can afford and not having a plan on a stock/trade.
