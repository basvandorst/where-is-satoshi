I truly believe privacy is much more than illegality. Countless studies proved that people behave differently when they know they might be watched. Sure, it means they will think twice before committing heinous acts, but it also means they will think twice before acting freely.
**Privacy is not about drug. It's about freedom.**

This is because the CryptoNote code calls for an entirely new coding. CryptoNote is like Bitcoin in 2010. We are busy working on this for Monero, but it takes time. You're welcome to help (coding or prospecting reliable coders).

Working more toward adoption. One is never as motivated as when one notices an immediate threat. So far, the closest thing to a threat is "wow, price is tanking". That's not enough.

I don't expect archaic nationalism to disappear. Rather I expect it to reconfigure, as several low-key national currencies will disappear and at the the same time large global companies ("megacorporations" for SF lovers) will issue their own money.
Nationalism has been around for litterally millenia. I strongly believe in test of time and diversity. One Single Money is just the opposite of it.
Unless, maybe, if people at large start to move around a lot (which is projected to happen) and frequently (which is not sure). But even then, I'm dubious about One True Money. It would require Money to be protocol and I believe it is a symbol.

The nature of disruptive innovation is that at the beginning, in performs worse than an existing solution. This is where Monero is at now: because it is disruptive (whole new codebase), it cannot take advantage of existing Bitcoin clones solution. But once this necessary first step is achieved, then the road is wide open and this is where the "no hardcoded limit" in Cryptonote (as opposed to Bitcoin base) really shines. To be honest, I do not know if ShadowCash implemented enough of Cryptonote to benefit from the "no hardcoded limit", but I believe it did not.

Is it possible to add CounterParty on top of another altcoin? DogeParty is created with proof-of-burn over Dogecoin, right? So this means that one has to handle two cryptos, effectively diluting the volume (at least for a time) and the attention (tracking two coins).
Or is there a way to implement CounterParty on the very same coin?

You sentence refers to mixin 0 for full transparency. Mixin 0 is being phased out for the reasons above, leaving viewkey to achieve the same purpose.

We organise retreat there too. Last one was in September (we decided not to be organise any during winter).
BTW, I will be in Tallin the 10th and 11th of January. I would like to take advantage of the opportunity to meet cryptocurrency enthusiasts in the location of your choice. We'll talk about Bitcoin in Estonia (including Rakvere) and, since I also am core dev for Monero, I'll be delighted to introduce you to this fully private crypto and to answer any question.
You can leave me a message on Bitcointalk (account is David Latapie) to arrange anything you'd prefer not to make public.

Full transparency is being phased out because it would be "contagious" to people who don't want their own transaction to be transparent [MRL-0004](
If you want transparency, the correct way is to use a **viewkey**:
* [Monero, the next step, regulatory conformance](
* [Introduction to Monero, viewkey – 1/2](
* [Introduction to Monero, viewkey – 2/2](
* [Moneroeconomy.com FAQ - both private and transparent](

Privacy is much more than illicit activity. Some examples of what privacy prevents:
* targeted advertisement and profiling
* who shall I rob today?
* Gossip on how you spend (or don't spend) your money
* Look, boss, I'm part of a trade union!
* Unwittingly tainted money
* Contracts, salaries, margins, suppliers...
* Miners can become censors (they know where the money go, they can be "encouraged" to slow down your competitor's transaction considerably, for instance, or refuse transactions without a future "innovative feature")
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:58:19
Plus their multisig is only for mixin 0. In other words, it is either multisig or privacy, but not both. Better use Bitcoin (for multisig, although private multisig is planned on Monero) or Monero (for privacy).
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:54:47
Per-transaction viewkey will take care of this. They are not developed yet, though.

Great writeup OP, it definitely help me and I will credit you in a forthcoming article.
I still have a question: how would watching-only wallet take care of the matter of ordering an item? Receiving money is only one part of the act. The rest is about identifying the user and approving the purchase and I don't see how a watch-only wallet can deal with this. I never used Bitpay before, so maybe Bitpay doesn't handle this either?
@_date: 2015-03-20 13:05:24


I beg to disagree, there is more than just ring (I purposefully exclude everything about generation of token, like smooth reward or CryptoNight):
*   [Code for wallet is separated from code for node]( which is more secure
*   Stealth address
*   Tail emission to protect against the [lack of ultimate incentives to secure the network](
*   IP protection with i2p C++ router (granted, not done yet)
