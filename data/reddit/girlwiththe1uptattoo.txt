No, i honestly have no idea what titanium backup is. but i have gone through every channel i could think of and got nothing. and i did contact the developers, and they pretty much told me i was SOL. lol

after looking into it for days, it seems like the first app i used didnt give me a passkey or anything a long those lines, i emailed the developer and they pretty much told me that there was nothing i could do unless i backed up my wallet (Which at no point it asked me to do, or allowed me to do. I went back and re downloaded the app, just to make sure). 
I figured it was lost, but it never hurts to ask, right?

The first one i had was just called bitcoin wallet by bitcoin wallet developers. After i couldnt find a way to get what i had, i downloaded the one by coinbase, inc. Is that a decent one?

Where can i find the private key? Im looking through this app and nada. maybe im just over looking it?

its not the end of the world, i just figured i would throw it out to the reddit world to see if it was possible.

Oh snap... i need to find the private key for this new one then. So if i dont have the private key is there nothing i can do? Thank you for being so patient with me!

Wow greenaddress is so much more professional looking. Appreciate the help. I guess i will just have to sadly come to terms i may never see my little baby piece of bitcoin again.
