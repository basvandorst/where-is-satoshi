Things can be created without "mining". It's just being created. I don't think the term instamined or premined should be used on things that don't use miners or can't be mined in any way or form.
It's more accurate to call something pre-mined when a certain amount is mined before any public miner can get in. (Didn't the "developer" of bitcoin gold limit who could mine it for a while?)
Instamined should be something like when a certain amount is premade before miners start creating (for example Auroracoin if I remember correctly) either from a single block reward or from the start.
Otherwise it should just be a set amount, without anything related to mining. But maybe I'm way off, it's just confusing when everything is called premined.

Well, in some ways perhaps in others it feels very similar. Fees did go up back then too. I don't worry too much, every time I've done so in the past and tried to cut "losses" I've ended up regretting it after a short amount of time.

I'm curious, since some of these exchanges are seeing more than a million dollars per *day* in profits from fees on their platform, could Bitfinex not be funding (at least in some part) tethers with their own profits? 
I'm also curious, if there are other "investors" behind tether, how are they profiting from putting their money in tethers, whats the tether business plan?  Do they get part of fees collected from tether trading?

It doesn't take a lot of research to know otc would probably mean less slippage than dumping on a random exchange. They also reached out for tips to at least one big exchange which told them that as well.

I'm generally curious, why do people here hate taxes so much? They like living in modern societies (most of us at least) but don't like paying for the upkeep? 
Do people expect others to keep everything running while they themselves reap all the benefits of modern societies for free?
Sure, I'd agree if Gambia or some other random country I've never been to would try to tax me..  or if your government is taking 60-80%+ of your earnings.. but how common is that? I think it's only fair to pay something to the society I do live in
I guess technically you could always move into a forest somewhere and live off the grid where no one will tax you? It's a lot of work though, I'd rather pay tax.

I wouldn't be surprised though if it would bottom out at around 2500 (+/- 10%) especially with the drama coming up in a couple of months.  
What I find harder to guess is when we'll see a new top (if ever, there are of course no guarantees in this game and the past does not predict the future)
I do agree though that a 1% range would be pretty accurate. I do think that the "accurate" range is a bit narrower than the "close" range, but maybe thats just because English isn't my first language.
Not that I'd shed a tear if bitcoin went way above the previous top in a couple of weeks. That'd be great :) I'm not holding my breath for that though.

Surely the 60-80% bracket is only above a certain amount and only for the income that exceeds the amount?
Here in Iceland its:
37% for $3150 usd and below. 
38% for $3150 - $7800
46% for anything above $7800
If you're making $8000,  you'd only pay 46% of around  $200 for example.

I've been very interested in the situation in Venezuela but haven't had enough time to research it properly. 
I'm not arguing any points you (or anyone else) has made, I'm just generally curious if many purchased bitcoin during the peak in dec/jan over there, how did the crypto crash compare to their fiat crash since that time? I keep seeing people here say "lol, you shouldn't have bought during all time highs" to those unfortunate enough to do so, but what if you live in a country like Venezuela, you're kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place right?


Isn't that generally only the case where the infrastructure exists already.  Getting some random farmer far in the country side in india or africa or some other remote place might be a bit more costly I assume. (to be fair I have no idea but I'd think the infrastructure in Venezuela would be a bit better than many other places)
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:21:26
Have you heard of unrealized loss?
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:48:13
That's quite obvious in theory, not so much in reality though. As far as I know, most places don't deal out cheaper prices when you pay with bitcoin (aside from a handful of niche stores perhaps) (**edit:**please correct me if wrong, it's been a while since I purchased something with Bitcoin), but rather the price is quite similar so the vendor is just taking the difference instead of a card company or whatever. 
Is that much better for the consumer? 
I'd say your point was valid if the bitcoin price was in fact cheaper on average. Until then, it isn't.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:37:36
To be fair, a lot of people are not very good with computers. 
Until storing bitcoins safely becomes a LOT easier/simpler for a average human, a bank is much safer. That's just a simple fact any way you look at it.
I doubt most average humans have enough experience with computers to go through all the correct steps of securing their crypto. Some people simply don't have time to learn all this stuff. In that case, a bank is safer. Can you imagine your average grandparents or the average person who doesn't interact with computers daily storing their multisig wallets in secure places without any risk of messing something up and losing their funds forever?
Don't get me wrong, I dislike banks but I also think we're pretty fucking far away from bitcoin replacing it for the average person. The overall user experience is quite terrible and messy in crypto and banks offer a lot of other services that crypto doesn't (yet?). 
Apologies for shitty English, it's not my first or second language.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:46:56


How can't you see the difference? I guess you have a point if you ship a wad of paper bills everytime you purchase stuff? I don't think most people in western society do that anymore though. When I transfer something through my banks website or with a creditcard, (or if someone gains access to my bank or steals my creditcard) I *can* revert it.

I think most people don't care much about the vendors side. Vendors are probably a minority of users as well.
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:08:56
Well, English isn't my first language so probably I misunderstood. On average, aren't the majority of payments done through cards or transferred online through your banking website?
I'm curious also, in countries with shitty governments and no bank services, do they usually have solid mobile networks/internet connections?

But if I have my coins on Electrum or Breadwallet and don't plan on dumping BCC immediately and just hold both for a while, would I be safe by doing nothing for a few weeks?
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:39:08


Who says they aren't?

Are there any wallets I can use that I can download straight through the iphone, not having to connect it to a pc to install? (I assume I'll have to do that with the .dmg Electrum file since I could not seem to do anything with it alone in my phone ) 
Phone seems somewhat broken and doesn't connect to pcs any more :(

I wouldn't be surprised if Poloniex did something similar to what happened with the Stellar giveaway last week. The Stellar blog claimed (since march this year) that Poloniex was one of the exchanges that had contacted them to take part in the giveaway so users wouldn't need to withdraw their bitcoins from the exchange.
Then after the blockchain snapshot had been taken last week Poloniex tweeted [this]( Ofcourse the snapshot had been taken so now it was too late for anyone to move their coins to take part of the giveaway.

I'm very confused. Is it okay to store coins on a Android electrum wallet if you don't plan on dumping, or moving any coins for a few weeks, can you hold both coins that way? 
Do I still have to worry about some servers and being on the correct one even if I don't plan on moving anything for a while?  (I'm just using whatever server or setting is default in the android wallet )
You do get access to your private key in Electrum, right? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:09:57
Is Breadwallet better? Aside from their fees I guess... what other wallets are there?
Hm, although you do control your private keys in Electrum right? Wouldn't you be able to use that in a BCC wallet eventually?
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:07:25
I wonder if this is outdated? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:30:08
Is there any way to control your fees in Breadwallet? It always asks me for so high fees when I move something out of it.
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:33:05
Any luck finding it?

Which wallets can be "swept  on the BTC chain with an additional output (for 0 coins)"? and is that something you would do AFTER the 1.august date?
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:39:18
 I remember a few whales losing hundreds/thousands of bitcoins on the Pocket Rockets Casino dice game.
Pretty sure Mechs was one of those as well,  after just-dice closed.
It was insane sometimes.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:24:43
Whats their subreddit? r/poloniex seems to be locked.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:50:15
Cool, thank you. Appreciate the help :)
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:20:59
If I use Electrum that is?.. can the private key from Electrum not be used in a BCC supporting wallet as well?
I'm very confused :(
Would Breadwallet be better for this? (Although I dislike their fees) or perhaps a different wallet? Any that you recommend? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:12:28
Thanks for the reply. 
These wallets all let you keep coin on both chains in case of a split? 
Do GreenAddress and Copay let you decide your tx fees yourself? I've tried Breadwallet in the past but the fees were quite high.
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:58:14
Are there any wallets I can use that I can download straight off the apple store? 
I can't install dmg files through itunes like Electrum requires me to do I think since my iphone isn't stopped being able to connect to my pc few weeks ago for some reason.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:02:56
I'm not sure what those numbers are based on. Current lending rate is around 1% - 1.5% per day on Poloniex.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:49:51
IOS won't have to worry about this at all?
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:26:02
Wouldn't Electrum be better than Mycelium since Electrum if you want to control the fees you pay?
I had to pay quite a high fee with Breadwallet if anyone is wondering about other wallets. It's the only wallet I have any experience with but Electrum sounds decent from what I've heard? Are there any big cons? 
I do love that Breadwallet lists the value in my local currency.

There was a AMA with the devs a few days ago and they cleared some things up. There's a updated whitepaper planed for release soon. Apparently most of the "risks" that people have brought up aren't really an issue.  
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:27:50
Would breadwallet let you control coins on both chains in case of a split?
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:35:11
Would storing your funds on Electrum let you have access to "both" chains if a split occurs on Aug1?

Thanks. I should have put a little more than 20$ since that became only worth about 0,016 btc while the minimum I can buy is 0,020. 
I'm wondering if I should add simply another 20$ or just the 5$ I'd need for the 0,004 btc I'm missing.

On virwox, do you need to purchase SLL first, and then exchange that to Btc?

My country is rather small. I tried searching on localbitcoins.com but I don't notice any local names. Is scamming common there?
Many of the names seem foreign, even referring other countries such as Russia etc.

I like the gravity well concept which [you can read about on this subreddit] ( 
It seems to be on the rise as well, a lot of growth in the last 30 days and it's not too expensive yet. Still mineable etc. But they have not opened for any fiat exchanges yet so everything has to go through bitcoin or litecoin first.  
I have pretty much no idea what litecoin is or if it would be smarter to buy those instead of btc to make the megacoin purchase. I'm not sure if it's worth it though, a few dollars +/- don't worry me too much.
I just thought it would be interesting to make a small purchase of a hundred or so megacoins, see how it goes over the next few months.
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:15:37
Yep, thinking about doing so later today. Thanks!
Since you said 100$ was around 0.092btc, I'm assuming a 50$ would be around 0.046btc?
Doesn't seem too bad. I'm seeing 0,1 btc for 111$ on ebay for example.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:36:41
Thanks again. 
What exactly do you mean by cashing out, is it either: 
If I want to turn LLS into dollars for example? 
Or do you mean if I want to take my BTC to another service after purchasing them?
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:20:43
Ah, then I guess I'll do it asap then. Taking that first step is always a bit hard. ;)
Thanks yet again. I appreciate the help.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:28:54
I'm always a bit worried about exchanging one currency to another. How fast does this happen? Is there some delay of hours or days between purchasing the SLL until I can purchase BTC?  
What I mean is, would 100$ worth of SLL become around 0.100 bitcoin at current $-&gt;Btc rates? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:46:21
I began by putting 20$ into my account through paypal. It turned into 19.02.
I'm about to purchase some SLL now, but if I'm reading [this image]( correctly, a huge spike upwards just occured? Is it better to hold off for now, or maybe it doesn't matter that much if I just buy the sll right now and then btc immediately?
