Coming from the person who was arguing about hyperinflation being a threat to a country currently fighting a deflationary spiral, hahaha.
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:28:23


The price has not bounced back for over a year now. Matter of fact the price has slowly falling and not bounced since then now. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 09:00:32
If the price would bounce back every time it would not be falling constantly for the last 16 months. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 05:30:53
And how do you access them? If its declared illegal in your country, you wont be able to wire money or pay with your cc.
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:39:05
Maybe you should stop insulting other people if your knowledge about the situation is very thin. I was saying that the largest junk of Japans debt is held by its own citizen not that it was private debts. Thats why Japan has zero problems paying back its own debt atm.

Most savings account offer higher interest than inflation.

Ups the government just declared Bitcoin illegal and you can not spend it anywhere anymore or exchange your fiat for it. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:37:04
No. Context matters. That's why Japans 175% is not that much of a problem.
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:19:55
Alcohol has value by itself; its fun to drink. Bitcoin is useless if you can't spend it. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 05:43:37
Really depends on where you are from. Point is, you probably could do it, but by this point the vast majority of people won't, and it would really not be worth the effort. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:29:45
That's why I said to exchange it against $.
@_date: 2015-08-18 08:33:57
Why? It would just show that one better technology replaces the other if neccessary.
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:46:24
So, what are you trying to say? 
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:56:59
Maybe, but until this is true, the trend is still declining and the price hasn't bounced back.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:59:43
Hahaha. Now you retreating to attack my use of the English language? This is getting better and better. You are joke about arguing on the internet coming to live. 
1: Engage in a discussion about a topic you know nothing about.
2: Insult the discussing party if called out on it, accusing him of knot knowing what he's talking about.
3: Ignore provided sources at any cost, insist on your previous line of argumentation, even when presented with contradicting facts.
 
3: Become a grammar Nazi when you have dug your hole so deep, there are no arguments left to defend your own stupidity.

Japanese prisons are not a joke.
@_date: 2015-08-24 18:02:05
Except its not going up.
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:38:14
That's why I said; nobody is going to buy **legal** goods over darknetmarkets. I also will never be ever be able to buy raw milk over the internet because of the whole cooled transportation problem.
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:49:22
If you want to be a really good friend, tell him to convert the bitcoins into $ or at least use those bitcoin freeze companies, that looking up the price. It would be really sad if they would lose 10 % of their fortune over night when bitcoin should fall in price again. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:52:48
Correct. Apart from drugs you could not spend your Bitcoin on anything. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 21:56:48
This is blatantly untrue and historical incorrect for most times. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:46:36
Were you not here for the constant price decline from $1100 the months before that? There have been short periods of build ups but the overall trend of declining has not been broken yet. The price is going down a lot more than its going up.
@_date: 2015-08-19 12:30:32
I think you are the person who is clueless. The reason why the debt is not a problem because most of the debt Japan has is by its own citizen not because it can print the debt away.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:24:34
Its always cute when people on the internet who have no knowledge about a given trying to discuss it. Especially if said people use caps lock and insults to compensate for their lack of knowledge. It must feel good to have a strong opinion about a topic something without any prior education of it. 
For anybody else reading this; no it is in fact no worse for a country to own debt to its own citizen because in doubt you can just tax it away or pay it back via QE. Something Japan even easier can do because it already is in a deflationary spiral anyway so hyperinflation is not really a problem.  The economists goes more into the topic here: 
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:16:22
No, its not.
@_date: 2015-08-03 05:54:35
In reality though those black markets are used to sell illegal goods i.e. drugs. Nobody is going to buy or sell their milk over the darknetmarket. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:17:10
I said Japan can print away some of its debt, not its financial problems, although I would not expect someone like you to understand the finer differences of such a statement.
You probably should read the provided the article before you're making an even bigger idiot of yourself if you haven't done it by now.

Does not really seem that big with only 150 player online. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:26:26
So you kept bothering them to get an App to give them bitcoin and when they didn't (because they obviously didn't care) you went ahead and made a paper wallet as their birthday present? Talking about forcing a "gift" on someone. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:50:08
Haha. True. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:39:36


You are not even pretending to know anything any more, do you?

The USSDR would have loved it.

Does it? Which large Bitcoin gambling sites exist?
@_date: 2015-09-24 07:51:15
Bitcoin soon six years old. When does it stop being an experiment?

@_date: 2015-09-29 16:03:55
discussed this already and came to the conclusion its bullshit. If it was true why are the transaction he is speaking about not on the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-09-20 12:14:24
Why more confidence than ever before?
@_date: 2015-10-07 13:20:10
This is currently not possible simply because of the volatilty. People sending money home need the security of not losing 5 - 10 % of the value overnight.
