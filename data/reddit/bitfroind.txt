"Die Niedrigzinsen der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) belasten deutsche Banken schwer. Sie müssen sogar Strafzinsen zahlen, wenn sie Geld bei der Notenbank parken. Dass einzelne Institute die Negativzinsen direkt an Privatkunden weitergeben, hält der Bankenverband zwar für unwahrscheinlich." 
My (probably bad) translation:
Low interest rates from the EZB put heavy weight on German banks. They even have to pay a penality if they store their money on the central bank. Nevertheless, the central banking committee thinks THAT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES ARE PASSED THROUGH TO PRIVATE CUSTOMERS.

As a German myself I can confirm. I recently moved my emergency fund to BTC. 
More conservative approaches seem in the light of negative interest rates and an excessive welfare state sensless. 
Edit/Addendum: IF I lost my job and required social welfare the first thing the state does is checking my accounts and forcing me to spend my savings. I don't think they spent much thought on incentive structures.

By taxing cooperations you drive up the cost of the products people need. So corporate tax = individual tax. There is no free lunch. 
The only way of raising living standards is to have a more efficient resource allocation. But beware what counts as efficient is subjective in terms of the preferred good from the customers. Capitalism serves that end well.

I think this is a misunderstanding. As you self say:


The backing is the willingness of people to buy it. The same goes for gold but also for tulips. 


Absolutely correct. Even if owning bitcoin just so make you sleep well qualifies as utility in the best sense. The deniers of utility are looking for something objective but forget that even food has not objective value for someone on hunger strike.

You certainly could find an upper limit for the information that can be stored in the bag. Assuming the spin of electrons is used to store one bit you would just have to calculate the number of electrons that the densest possible matter that could be carried by the bag hodler bare. Considering the ease with which he is carrying his bag, it cannot be more than 10 kg. 
Unfortunately this number physically determined number is way larger than the amount of information needed to store 17 Million bitcoins which is roughly the amount of coins we have today.
To answer you initial question: The bitcoin capacity of the bag is 21 million but it has max. 17 Million in it. Probably less.

You ground intrinsic value in utility but utility it self depends on the ends of individuals, i. e. what they want. This again is purely subjective. So your "intrinsic" value is in reality extrinsic because it depends on the subjective attitudes of (economic) agents.

Yeah, there is an inner tension that can't be resolved. I really think the subjective theory of value and fundamental analysis on basis of intrinsic value are inconsistent. 
We have good explanations of how objective prices emerge from subjective valuations, but putting a price tag that denominates it's "intrinsic" value seems paradoxical in the light of the generation of prices in the first place.
@_date: 2019-07-04 03:32:44
The wonder of the free market is to find objective prices that emerge out of subjective valuations without coercion. 
It is analog to contracts that manifest the subjective and ephemere wanting of individuals into objective and reliable facts.
They are the best and only way to resolve peacefully the tension between differing individual valuations.

We own a little BTC. My wife got drawn in by me in 2016 now she panics, she wants to sell. All she saw was one long moon trip and she thought she could handle the dips. She knew nothing. She made retirement plans and what not. The worst part is that we ave an argument about it while I always reminded her that we are in for the long game and that 50% drop don't matter. I told her to sell her part if she doesn't believe me. But i fear a rebound would endanger our marriage. I'm sad.

Keep in mind that prices are often expressed in coffee or cigarettes or canned fish. There is nothing magical in expressing it in terms of money. The exchange is symmetrical: A 20 cigarettes cost $5 and $1 costs 4 cigarettes. It's really just a habit because money has some convenient characteristics: durability, mobility, its divisible and often stable in its valuation relative to other goods.

Mises showed how money emerges from barter in a natural way. The thought is not too complicated, it's a chicken-or-egg problem. Do we value money because we can exchange it for goods, or can we exchange it because we value it? 
Menger (Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre 1871) gave only a partial explanation but did not solve this circularity. Mises proposed that every monetary unit must first have been valued independently of its function as money (but not in an objective sens - no "intrinsical" value involved) before the use shifts progressively (it's a *regression* theorem only when you start from money) towards the monetary function. (Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel 1912)
You need that to close the gap between IOU and the believe in future value.

I think the "when did value start"-question is rather easily answered: when someone trade pizza for bitcoin. *Why* did he so? Maybe it was a joke at first. Just fun. Like children who exchange sand for chestnuts. That combined with the other properties of bitcoin (book keeping system, limited supply, transferability) was enough to kick start value ascription. 
"It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy." Satoshi
"As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: - boring grey in colour - not a good conductor of electricity - not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either - not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property: - can be transported over a communications channel If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it. Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it. I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something. (I'm using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply)" Satoshi

I mean as long as there is no enforced monopoly (lets say by the the state) every monopolist has to keep his prices at a level that does not encourage his competitors in spe to enter the market. The mere fear of competition is enough to avoid the allegedly bad consequences. There are many historical examples, that show that monopolies are a teeth-less dog. Some good literature is "The myth of antitrust" by Dominick T. Armentano. 
Which historical evidence do you refer to?

Intrinsic value does not exist. All value depends on what you want. What you want is an attitude - it does not get more subjective than that.
If a lot of people want to burn oil, its value is still not intrinsic. It is all to easy to imagine a world where we do not want to use oil. In such a world all value would have gone. The same think applies to bitcoin.

Is it possible to align the incentives that way? Everyone who buys mining hardware hopes to make more out of it then selling. And everyone who sells mining hardware hopes to make more out of it then by buying it. This seems inherently contradictory.
The best one can hope is that it is unclear weather buying (keeping it) or selling is the best option so that some trade emerges. But I doubt that it is possible to have good mining hardware where the producer is not strongly tempted to just mine by himself.

You described what one can do with bitcoin but you faild to explain why this is intrinsically valuable. The so called intrinsic value would cease to exist the moment we find a more favoured way to achive what you said.
Ask your self: Would bitcoin or the internet have any value if it was given to Robinson Cruseo (persuming he was the only man on earth)?
If the answer is no, we can see that the value depends on the circumstances (i.e. the attitudes of agents) which is quite the opposite of intrinsic value. Intrinsic value should be independed of the circumstances. 
Something is valuable because people value it and not the other way around.

They never get tired of preaching DCA but one simple thought experiment shows that it is financially inferior. 
If you assign for every time that the asset in question will rise on average (even knowing it might drop some time) you should invest as much early as possible since you don't know if it will drop or rise but you believe the probability of rising is higher. That way you maximize you gains (or losses if you were wrong). 
DCA does smooth out your gains and losses but it is for sure not a maximizing strategy. You don't even need empirical data. If you want a smooth experience do DCA, if you want to maximize don't.

There is a limit for time preferences. Sooner or later people consume. You can see the whole hardware market as deflationary. With every day gone you get more CPU power for your money. Why buy today if you can get more tomorrow? And people still buy. Today.
It's the same for all goods in a deflationary money system. Sure there will be a transition where time preferences have to align and find new equilibria. This could lead to a temporary reduction in consumption. I don't like to quote Keynes but he's right: In the long run we are all dead, so we have to consume sometime. After the period transition the new monetary system should just work as the hardware market does -- without robbing savers.

The smaller the group the more likely it is that he is a man. It's just statistics. Mathematical and technical abilities are very unevenly distributed especially in the extrem ends of the distribution. Furthermore, the group -- if any! -- can't have been very big (let's say more than three) because the danger of leaking information rises exponentially and there where no leaks.
If assuming a male name belongs to a male person without knowing anything more is wrong we have to say good bye to any heuristics. If not I see no reason to play the agnostic by phrasing agnostic -- this is just willingly pretending we had less information than we actually have. And in violation of the maxim to convey as much information as possible.

That is absolutely correct. There are many cases where women were forced to work undercover. Sophie Germain comes to mind, who studied under a male pseudonym. 
The point I'm trying to make is that language should track reality as informative as possible (not as true as possible -- that would be easy: just add "or not." to the end of every sentence). 
As long as the heuristic holds I'm against modifying language because we would lose non trivial knowledge. That social categories and language are interwoven does certainly not help. To try to solve the problem by a top-down approach does more harm than good, I think.

To be honest I did not understand. It seems to me what money is and what money is not depends on a form of collective intentionality. Without asking difficult questions about the minimal size of such a collective, let's imagin the following:
I give you 1 BTC and you agree to give me a cow. Further more you and I believe that some other people are willing to give you things in exchange für the BTC. And we believe that other people believe the same thing. Last but not least we are also willing to conduct these exchanges.

One seldom mentioned aspect is the fact that every individual miner has incentives not to mine 2x even IF all would agree in words to mine it.

The Book (same title) is worth a read. Although he does not mention cryptos it is very clear that he has the right idea. 
Money is just information and the legacy banking system is the best form of guaranteeing that the conveyed is valid we had. Thus centralization of trust was a necessary evil which is not an atavism. 
Fetching his theory a bit farther we can conclude that the *physicality* of money is an antagonism as well. In fact it will become the burden that will bitcoin allow to succeed because bitcoin is trusted information without contingent drawbacks.

blockchain.info is a company named after the fundamental innovation that assures bitcoins immutabillity the chain of blocks that contain the transactions (--&gt; the blockchain). While the company could be gone tomorrow, the bitcoin-blockchain is not stored by a single entity and cannot be erased.

Did not want to have them at home. Spread them to my parents and my sister/brother in law. I kept only one hardware wallet.
EDIT: I thought if ever something happened to 1 of 3 locations or even 2 of 3 if the hardware wallet is safe, I'm fine. Did not seem like a bad backup practice.

Thank you for the first serious answer. I use greenaddress.it. The chrome extension usually shows "log in via hardware wallet" after you plug in the HW1. This message does not occur anymore. My spouses Nano S still works with greenaddress, so I'm pretty sure it's a hardware issue.

I stored the HW1 under best conditions.

I read an police statement some months ago where they say
a) do not ever pay those criminals. You encourage crime.
b) do not pay - it is unlikely you will recive the code to unlock
c) instead go to the police and report the case.
I guess they followed at least c).

Leaking 16/24 will probably lose your money. The remaining combinations are 2048^8 which should be bruteforcable. (Anyone feel free to correct my math.)

I know, but unfortunately this it not the problem. I had it working for years and now it's failing cross platform. :-( 
I'm very confused because I thought smart cards such as the hw1 were extremely durable.

Markets produce prices, not values. Prices are objective, values aren't. It's well possible to not value something expensive and vice versa. You need to make a clear distinction between both. 
contracts : attitudes :: price : value
One is objective, the other is not.

First of all: Sorry for the "Oops, ..."-part. That was not the tone I should have chosen. But in the subject matter I'm serious. 
I think you are still conflating objective and subjective value as your questions imply. 


The values are not brought in to the world by the thing it self, e. g. water, diamonds or bitcoins, but depend on the propositional attitudes the market participants hold. 
A subjective attitude is something like "*x* wants, that *p*" where *x* is an subject, wanting the specific attitude and *p* the proposition in question. "Bob wants that his account holds one bitcoin." - notice how the truth values of "his account holds one bitcoin" and "Bob wants that his account holds one bitcoin." differ. Within these attitudes lies the key to understand values. 
The market values on the other hand are things that exist independent of Bob's believes and wants. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for market prices that individuals have a subjective valuation and cooperate. What ever emerges as the focal point of trading maybe our price but is still not a value in it self.
One very bitcoin-specific property is, that it is valued highly and aspires to build a Schelling-point of crypto currencies. But if it is *valued* as such is an other question.
Please notice how far away we are from any "labor theory of value". Locke looked at value from the wrong side, empowerd faulty marxian thinking, led to objectivity in values where none was und ultimately to the death of 120 million people. 
I could write more about that but English is not my mother tongue and a book would more appropriate to lighten up all the intricacies of value, action and cooperation.
I hope I could express myself clear enough.

@_date: 2019-05-22 16:24:38
Oops, you did it again. Values in "subjective values" are not the same as market values. 
Prices are the expression of the market value, which is objective.
 
While "subjective value" and "market value" have both the word "value" in them, in one case the predicate is determining in the other case modifying. 
The difference is the same between a "small fish" and a "painted fish". The latter is no fish.

The correct answer is phone apps by default, i. e. no jailbreak etc., they run their apps in protected environments. 
The worst is probably an unprotected windows system, because there is more malware that targets windows than linux systems.

Yes, they only find their way to the blockchain when the channels are closed. BUT it does not mean that you are at risk of double spending or reversing transactions even if you would never decide to close your channels.

I think it is a reoccurring motive in mythology and it is hard to determine if it is by accident or influence. 
I personally think these are archetypical ideas that develop independent in different cultures through the ages.
