Number of email accounts in the 90s. Number of new nodes on BTC's Lightning network. Ebola. Bubonic plague. Anything that spreads person to person by (word of) mouth. It's a very sensible growth rate on a logarithmic scale.
BTC maintained only an exponential growth rate throughout Q4 2017. It didn't even go parabolic (as it did before two previous crashes). When it goes parabolic, I start to get worried. This correction back to November's prices has returned my confidence to BTC's longterm exponential growth rate.

I have mad respect for Amir. It shows he's earned that respect when he retweets counter-arguments made against him. I'm going to leave his helping Rojava out of the debate because I don't think we'd have a productive discussion on r/bitcoin about whether or not cypherpunks should join anarcho-socalist states ;)

A lot of people don't understand even the basics of bitcoin. That would create the false impression that the ability to buy bitcoin is running out. I suggest just make a currency conversion ticker, but show the value of the USD dollar as measured in BTC and include the little red down arrow and percentage movement.

Yes, in some unknown period of time, BTC will be a decrepit grandfather in a very different cryptocurrency innovation space. But that decade is not the 2010s. [Observe the growing number of new nodes testing out the fully functional (early) release of LN.](

lol. Have you ever lived in a country with a second tier currency? Bitcoin is literally the cheapest and safest way to move any more than \~$1,000 US out of these countries. It also allows you to keep  control of your funds rather than trust sending it to a relative or friend in another country through services like Western Union. Venezuela's case shows that being in a low-income country is no barrier to affording bitcoin in small amounts. BTC is on the rise in all such countries proportionate to their internet access and the general perspective of fear for their own currencies. Of course not every Turkish or Brazilian person knows what this magical Internet Money is, but there's already a higher percentage of BTC users in Caracas, Venezuela than in New York, US.  
I can't predict whether this transnationalization of bitcoin will play out rapidly in 12 months or on the medium term in in 48 months, but barring any massive and surprise failure in BTC tech (possible, but unlikely), the fate of bitcoin is world wide adoption starting not in the United States but in the former Eastern Bloc and Soviet countries: the so called "2nd World".

Sending BTC to a wallet right now costs 0.001 BTC on other exchanges. What is GDAX's rate?

Canadian here. Coinbase is the best for purchases under $75-$125.
Quadriga is the next best with only a 1.5% fee for Interac purchases, but you have to pay a minimum fee of $5, so it doesn't beat Coinbase's 4% fee for small purchases. (I believe Coinbase also has a $3 minimum fee, so purchase under $75 end up paying more than 4% also...)
A lot of other things require a wire transfer, which cost me $30 (so that's a high percentage on a low amount of money).
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:40:39
But then there are transfer fees on each GDAX withdrawl...
Edit: Neat! Thanks. I use Kraken and Bitfinex and I did not know that GDAX could withdrawl to GDAX wallets at 0 fee.

If you live or work in more than one country, bitcoin is incredibly valuable. It's a transnational currency that you can send to your online work partners in other countries, and they can buy or spend it in Thailand as easily as you can buy or spend it in USA. As adoption increases, it only becomes more valuable. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:14:37
I agree that current market valuation is a speculation on future rather than current value. But that's true of every investment/stock price. A large number of people are purchasing bitcoin now not to do business internationally, but because they think many other people will eventually purchase it do business internationally.  
If you don't think it will have more value in the future, don't invest in it. But I think you'll be missing out.

Let me guess. You're American? Many people in the world can't access a credit card as easily as Americans can (let alone a bank account), and their national currency is not as liquid as USD. But those people can access the internet, and that's enough to use cryptocurrencies. Visit any world capital with a second tier currency (ie, not GBP, USD, EUR), and you will see signs for bitcoin on every major shopping street.
Most people currently pay 2.5%+ and possibly other fees for changing between national currencies. The more can be done in one currency, the more money they can save. Americans don't realize the value crypto has for the new middle class living in the former Soviet countries and East Asia. Bitcoin is becoming that one currency for many people that live internationally, like freelancers that work online for a company or clients in other countries.


This doesn't go away with cyrpto. There will still be a secondary market for off-chain middlemen that provide such services. But with crypto, you have the option of using them or on-chain transactions. You like using cash for some transactions, so why not digital cash for other transactions?
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:33:43
I think we'll find support at the price point where the side-lined institutional investors are planning to enter the market. The fundamentals are still rock solid and even better than last year thanks to Lightning Network and Liquid. Speculative demand might be lower in 2018 than in 2017, but legitimate demand is higher after more and more people have begun to understand the value of bitcoin as a secure/independent/transnational digital currency. Not to mention all of the utility that comes out of layer 2 tech.

I have been waiting 3+ weeks for my QCX verification. They have a backlog now.
Their 1.5% interac fee is slightly better than using an international exchange though. I once did a $30 wire transfer of CAD to Kraken (European exchange) and I got hit with a 2.5% currency conversion fee twice in order to bounce the money into and then back out of an intermediary currency (JPY).  (If you go with an overseas exchange, make sure you're crediting your account with the same currency as the country as the bank you're transferring to. I would have only paid one currency conversion fee if I wired money to their German bank to credit my account with euros.)

Utility of Bitcoin:
* Reduced banking fees and business fees on many types of accounts and transfers
* One-to-one international transfers/purchases
* Conducting business internationally, especially if you live in a country with a second tier currency
* Hedge against catastrophic inflation caused by geopolitics as in Turkey, Venezuela, and even the UK
* Hedge against everyday inflation as with all national currencies
* Avoiding American banking sanctions if you are an Iranian or Russian oligarch (for example)
* Access to digital banking for individuals shut out of the banking industry due to the nature of their country's relationship with the US
And many many other use cases that come out of being able to side-step the status quo power of governments over national currencies and of the banking corporations over financial transactions.
Edit: And all that is just on the base layer of bitcoin. So much more unimaginable utility is going to be developed on layer two technology, like the Lightning Network and Liquid. Lightning will allow secure value to stream across the internet as effortlessly and regularly as data. Liquid will allow other assets (like deeds of physical ownership, legal papers, copyright, etc.) to be pegged to bitcoin's secure network.

I actually found localbitcoins.com to have about the same or better cost as Coinbase when you factored in the 4% that coinbase charges you.
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:38:05
This is important because miners are the number one sellers. They are not HODLers. They got bills to pay on the regular. If they start receiving half as much bitcoin, then they can only sell half as much bitcoin, and the downward pressure on the price from miners offloading their newly-minted coins will thus also be cut in half.

I was subscribed for a few months in order to make sure I was also exposed to criticisms of bitcoin. The segwit vs 2x and bigger blocks debate was interesting. But after 2x lost that debate, the majority of their pro-BCH points are nonsense. The more I read of "both sides" the more I realized BCH is doomed to fail because there is only room for one bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:30:56
My theory for the BTC sideways movement of the last two weeks:
Obviously a lot of people (traders, recent buyers, and old hodlers), think the BTC price is going lower and want to sell. They have pushed it downward after every recent climb (on Apr 3 and Apr 9).
However, the greater force is the new whales that have been eying BTC since it's newsworthy growth last year. It is common sense to say that anyone looking to start investing in BTC for the first time and who has done their risk/reward research has picked a price point at which to buy in. This includes all the new crypto hedge funds. What is unknown is how much new money is coming in and at what price they are looking to buy BTC.
I had previously thought that 1/4 of the ATH price at 5k USD would be the largest support line of new money coming in. But, it's looking like 1/3 of the ATH is more likely, at 6.5k USD. 
To me, these previous two weeks of support at 6.5K USD suggests that 1/3 of the ATH is the magic support number at which many new whales want to buy in. Consider the quick bounce back during the Feb 5 dip. So why 1/3 of ATH? It is similar to previous BTC major corrections, but it's literally just a mental number that stands out in investors' minds: "BTC will probably fall to one third of its ATH price during this correction," is easy to say, so that's where they plan to buy in.
I don't believe in predicting the future, but as a BTC (longterm) trader, I believe in betting on the future. My bet is that there is potential for a BTC 2018 ATL of 5k USD, but I think this recent bouncing off the 6.5K USD line over the last two weeks is the bottom of the 2018 price correction. A slow and steady bull market could follow.
This is not financial advice. DYOR. Posting here only to timestamp my estimate.
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:44:22
Agreed. Also a singular newsworthy financial event could disrupt any such price predictions. I am personally acting on my prediction, but that action is definitely a form of gambling.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:14:15
Yup. Right now miners are raking in 1500 coins per day. They have bills to pay. And if they think the price is going to drop, they're selling 1500 coins per day.
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:49:10
Nice. Sell only $30k/year. Set for life.
