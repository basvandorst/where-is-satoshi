Wow, Bitcoin has reached 'tech jargon' status in TV crime drama.

I expect any fees that PayPal charges won't be felt from the consumer side and will be visible only to the merchant, similar to they way credit card fees are handled already.
Sure other payment services have been associated with Bitcoin longer, but many merchants have a long history with PayPal, and are more likely to trust them as a middleman for a currency they might not entirely trust yet.

Not saying it's a bad thing at all! It really just signals that it's a common household word already.

I'm not sure in what way you think Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. Feel free to elaborate.

So, can I mine with my GTS 450 again?

I think most merchants who end up accepting bitcoin with PayPal will be using PayPal to convert coins into dollars or some other fiat currency, which inherently requires a middleman.
The advantage of Bitcoin remains the same. There is no central authority telling you how much money there is, or will be. Corruption within PayPal doesn't affect the stability of Bitcoin as a currency.

While I understand the fact that you have concerns about the long-term stability of an inherently deflationary currency, it simply isn't the same thing as a pyramid scheme. Calling it such is a false equivalence at best.

It enables businesses already accepting payments through PayPal to easily accept Bitcoin as payment.
Paypal is already trusted in the business of online payment, and their acceptance of Bitcoin might get more people to accept its use as a legitimate currency. If I understand correctly, any businesses that accept PayPal payments can now accept Bitcoin as easily as ticking a check box.

I hope you aren't sending coins straight from Coinbase to btc-e. I'd feel uncomfortable if I didn't send it through a wallet I control first, just so I have complete control of the transactions.

Just like bitcoins.
