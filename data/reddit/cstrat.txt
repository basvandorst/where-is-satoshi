Have you used blockchain.info as a wallet?
Is it possible to add a fee after the fact? Can I cancel this transaction and make a new one?
From what I have seen none of this is possible
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:23:33
Need to add Australian alerts. Not sure how you could send SMS for free here - I am pretty sure all the SMS gateways cost money.
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:27:27
You mean the straight word.
It will still expect to see a guess of the wavy word.
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:26:47
yeah, not those copper ones.
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:12:40
thats fkn awesome. i wish i had me some of those in real life =D
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:33:37
ohh cool! thanks!
looks like almost 100,000 coins have been lost...
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:08:08
all the people who remembered last weekends drop and want to get on board to buy in at lower prices have put sell orders in the system.
trading lag has held them up, so they will end up selling out at the bottom and having to buy in during the recovery and make a loss.
not worth the effort..
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:11:40
damn, very quick round that one. i lost.
i like the concept though!
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:55:18
20 BTC lost in one transaction
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:51:48
Can someone explain why *some* transactions have quite a long delay...
99% of my transactions are fine, however a batch of the ones I submitted this morning are all stuck.
See below:
Poor network propagation. Over 6 hours and no confirmations.
I would love to know how it works.
Has my transaction been submitted to a dodgy node? e.g. That node isn't doing so well mining for blocks, and as such my transactions haven't been included anywhere?
@_date: 2013-04-02 08:16:12
I don't think there is any point jumping into mining now unless you've got custom built gear.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:51:59
You're going to have to find that wallet.dat file and load it up to check.
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:37:53
Ohhh what I meant was - we know the total possible coins available at any given time... however we don't know how many coins have been lost in wallets.
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:40:55
 is a good place to start!
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:23:29
Standard behaviour. I had to bite the bullet and buy in at $40 after watching it go from $20 -&gt; $40 waiting for my MtGot account to get verified.
I could have just as easily thought I missed the boat. I actually invested a lot less because of that, but I still bought in and am happy to have got on board now...
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:59:00
correction: couple of hours.
@_date: 2013-03-26 10:44:30
poor implementation if this is the case... has it been tested?
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:48:14
@_date: 2013-06-07 01:14:52
FYI - the funds still haven't hit my MtGox account. It has only been 3 and a bit days, but I am used to much quicker turn around.
@_date: 2013-03-19 04:34:43
you can check transactions here: 
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:34:27
yeah that does look weird.  
what wallet are you using?
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:11:18
Thanks - yeah I am aware of the basics with transaction fees. I have made thousands of transactions. This is the first time I have had to wait 6 hours, and if you look at the screenshot. It says that the network propagation is **very poor**.
Do you know what that means?
I have other unconfirmed transactions with **good** network propagation... (see: 
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:37:51
I have had a bunch of issues lately too. To be honest, they all come good after a long time. Today I had to wait about 10hrs, yesterday I had a couple get stuck for a long time too.
I think I was just unlucky with which node my transaction went to. They weren't seeming to propagate through the network at all.
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:35:36
hahaha yeah good one.  
i am guessing you're making fun of all the litecoin people trolling this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:55:56
jmeds33 - try it out :)
@_date: 2013-03-24 02:10:57
So what happens if you both guess wrong, and the two guesses aren't the same... is that house win?
(edit: after testing it out, yes house win)
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:25:26
When I get to my pc I will write something up for you.
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:37:29
what is the URL? i tried bitcoinrunner.com - fail
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:30:56
What wallet software are you using?  
I am guessing this is your wallet: 1ywLprS23hCvjWrUuEzEkWsD2gqReoFdq
Your money ended up here: 16uixX3pXt7vADZFV8swUqgEbLki3BDch9
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:17:08
I love this, wanted to make something similar myself.
@_date: 2013-06-12 04:23:30
Money arrived.
@_date: 2013-03-23 05:45:35
awww I didn't know these easter eggs happened.
need to keep an eye on the charts :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:15:39
I am in a similar situation. I did get out slightly ahead, but still lost a lot.
Satoshidice gambling killed me. I started with about 2BTC, worked up to well over 120BTC. Sold out a bunch, and ended up losing a lot.
I have quit now after a string of massive losses, like 10BTC three times in a row. Lucky number I got for all three was something like 59000. No chance.
All I did was chase my losses.
I have quit now, only have coins in a paper wallet now. Not touching them until I need to spend them.
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:58:30
Such a load of rubbish.
So you think it is fair for a CEO or executives to sell out their stock options before the company announces a massive profit warning... or the other way around, its fair for someone within a waining business to buy up shares before the company announces a new product.
Both examples are people taking advantage of their position to cheat out other investors.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:28:02
yeah doesn't seem hopeful for you :(  
how much did you lose if you dont mind me asking.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:17:00
you're a massive hater aren't you. i get the name, but do you just troll this subreddit all day?
@_date: 2013-03-27 05:55:38
yeah i had the same thing happen.
from time to time that client gets really slow - and needs to be restarted.
once i restarted and lost the wallet. lucky that I had already exported the key...
@_date: 2013-03-29 05:36:14
First attempt at bit coin tipping...
+bitcointip rbitcoin-bot $1 verify
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:42:26
I think the Bitcoin address they give you does change periodically.
I have deposited into my old wallet address a couple of times without issues.
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:59:00
No worries, glad it worked out for you!  
Just out of curiosity, did you use a over the counter method, or did you just do it online with PayPal/direct deposit?
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:17:36
ohh does everyone throw money into a pool.
and the winners share the losers money...
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:57:28
I like how quickly I can buy on MtGox, no hassles.
Edit: Keen to one day try localbitcoins though!
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:18:47
he def gets the troll award
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:43:14
So to setup a MtGox account - 
You need lots of details: scanned licence and a scanned telephone bill and I cant remember but I think maybe even a bank statement.
Like MrOrange81 said - verification will take a LONG time.
It took me about 3 weeks, this was back when BTC was about $30USD... by the time I bought in they were already just over $40USD.
Once you have your MtGox account you transfer money into an account they give you:
























This is all documented on this page: 
An easier avenue is if you goto  - find someone to buy off.
The website will act as an escrow to make sure you pay - this will guarantee (i guess) that you get your BTC.
I've not personally used it, but I know people who have and it has been fine for them.
If you want to cash out back into AUD, you would either need to use MtGox or Localbitcoins - or just make a couple purchases and buy some stuff...
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:45:32
I actually think it is cheaper to send SMS to Australia from another country than it is to buy local SMS credit from a gateway here.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:06:39
I can't see it properly in the graphs because bitcointy summarises the data. Last weekend it dropped from the high $70s down to the $50s. Recovered over a couple days to hit new highs... and again drop.
@_date: 2013-06-08 23:48:38
I just got an email from MtGox support saying that Technocash is no longer a payment method... my money is still in limbo unaccounted for.
@_date: 2013-06-03 21:14:25
ohhh I just deposited some cash into there yesterday. Had no idea this happened.
Just logged into MtGox and got the details from the deposit tab.
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:51:05
i got liza minnelli singing money.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:33:54
have you watched this: 
@_date: 2013-03-24 02:05:23
I just clicked the link at the top of this page.
After I deposited the money I had a click around and saw that there were previous withdrawal addresses and there was a name set.
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:40:33
wow! that is awesome.
I have been playing SD for about 3 weeks now hoping to pull that move off... I am sure you've put a big dent in the SD finances for the next couple months.
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:48:44
Platforms like MtGox allow you to store bitcoins with them. That is NOT the same as having your own wallet. I did learn this the hard way trying to play Satoshidice from my MtGox account.
MtGox has one big wallet (over simplification I am sure) - and they keep a ledger of who owns what coins. Essentially acting as a bank holding your coins. You can withdrawn to an external wallet whenever you need to.
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:31:51
A massive buy order at $71 would pump the price up gobbling all open orders from $71 up until however high the buy order can afford...
However when that buy order is complete, no one else will have open orders around that same value and as such the price will begin to drop. Couple this with the massive sell order that the buyer is about to execute - this will drive the price down even further... probably well below the $71 mark...
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:45:01
Can't you create multiple receiving addresses for the same wallet.  
So you could receive payment into a clean skin address - however then spend it using another address?  
I am not sure, but using Multibit is almost looks like that is how it works.  
This could facilitate anonymity... (i could be wrong)
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:50:21
yeah think back to the early days of the internet before the .com boom. speculative buyers snagging domain names. doesn't seem like a waste of money now.
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:09:28
thanks OP!
Just placed the bet, had to play 0.009 didn't have enought for the tx fees for a 0.01 bet.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:17:45
hahaha. im an aussie who didn't sell.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:27:48
It is weird, none of my transactions are confirmed - over 6 hours in the network.
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:18:06
yeah i know.
i did actually go and validate it all with the hashes. so it came out legit... but i couldnt help but think the site was getting me back for my win streak the week before...
i think i was winning about 30BTC a day for a solid few days.
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:06:15
Would probably make them targets for hacking &amp; begging...
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:56:59
Technocash is just too easy to use!
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:59:28
awesome site, thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-26 10:43:47
ohhh can you?!
thats good to know, i just got my USB key and was wondering what happened if i lost it
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:11:55
That last point is probably still not a killer.
Bitcoin can be used in poorer regions. Especially countries where their local currency is almost worthless.
In many developing nations people quite often have access to mobile phones before they have access to electricity in their home. BitCoin can find its place there.
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:38:24
Yeah transferring BTC into and out of MtGox usually takes a while.
I normally just sleep on it and the next day the transfer is done.
@_date: 2013-03-24 02:06:15
why ruin all the fun!? :)
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:27:15
You are going to have to provide some more information.
Did someone steal from your wallet? Or did you buy from someone and they haven't transferred the coin?
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:23:44
voted x 6!
@_date: 2013-03-24 01:42:16
hey i just transferred some coin into it. before realising i was viewing someone else's page. (there were awards that had been won, and there was an alias set).  
i had to wait for my 2 confirmations to get my coin back out again...  
how do i get my own page, i don't want to risk someone else getting my page and withdrawing points...  
i am using suntsu's page.
@_date: 2013-03-29 05:55:28
Yeah I guess I will just wait. thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:36:34
yeah I have had this a couple of times when transferring in and out of my mtGox account especially.
I usually don't add the fee because I am not in a hurry to get the coin out.
right now i am waiting on my satoshidice transactions to complete... been waiting ages. probably for the best though!
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:21:07
I actually just want to login to move some coin into my wallet for some friends.
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:57:57
Have there been any stories of people losing large wallets you've seen?  
It would be interesting someone tried to keep a tally and track the lost coins.  
I am sure that SatoshiDice has lead to hundreds of coins being lost due to the small change passed around. I have abandoned wallets with &lt; 0.00X... 3,000,000 transactions...
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:35:14
I'm in Australia and it is Friday.  
4 day weekend with Good Friday and Easter Monday.
@_date: 2013-03-25 02:19:36
LOL. yeah lets sell our BTC and buy litecoins. that seems like the best thing to do...
@_date: 2013-03-29 05:33:17
The problem I am having is a couple of those transactions have only been seen by 1 Node. I am guessing that node doesn't want to include the transactions or even forward them on due to filters on SD...
Should I just load my wallet in another client and double spend so void the transaction that is going to take for ever...?
@_date: 2013-03-26 04:56:54
wooot, thanks! awesome.
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:48:52
hahaha. i should have just kept my mouth shut... ;)
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:16:58
I've only got 30BTC :(
@_date: 2013-03-24 01:43:23
plus i lost the transaction fees...
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:24:48
I have posted a question on SE: 
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:52:07
I will keep playing and losing as long as the 0.01's are flowing... =P
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:46:51
who is this maxwellhill person?
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:21:33
wooop whooooop!
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:47:31
whichever option you choose, make sure you back it up somehow...
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:47:23
You will need a wallet to store your bitcoins.
Blockchain provide a pretty neat service - I am using them for 90% of my transactions, however most of my coin is currently deposited in a wallet which is offline (paper wallet). Plenty has been said about paper wallets o reddit already - just search.
If you are only going to buy a few for fun.
Blockchain is probably fine!
I have also used Multibit on my PC.
Whatever you do - as soon as you create your wallet. Make sure you export and backup your private key. This key is *very* important.
If you lose that key, or if someone steals that key, your coins are as good as gone.
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:44:16
Yeah the whole system is down.
I have about 8 BTC worth of bets sitting in the ether.
Very keen to see what happened to them...
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:56:12
fear. looks like someone sold off a bunch of coin. dropped the market and it basically triggered a run to the bank.
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:33:08
that sucks!
I did a quick search on Reddit and there are a lot of threads from people who have lost wallets. I can imagine there are a LOTTT of lost coins.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:56:42
I think while the alternative exists (cash in local currency) - there is no point risking to spend BTC if there is a chance it will go up in value, which it has proven to do time and time again...
@_date: 2013-03-25 06:05:38
i think that they would have a hard time enforcing that rule.
if they wanted to charge a tax - it would need to happen at the point you convert back out to your national currency.
however you could just use your credit card to buy BTC from someone overseas and not pay tax...
the point of BitCoins is they can be used internationally without being linked to a country or person...
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:25:13
is that an actual mtgox fact?
(edit: checked your account and doubt you're affiliated with mtgox...)
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:39:50
It is true that they will 99% of the time convert straight back to USD.
However with the number of people trying to get into the market - there need to be more BitCoins circulating.
I don't think the impact of a couple stores would have a big effect on the exchange rate.
The more distributed the currency, the better off everyone is. If more stores accept it as a payment method, more people will want to get on board... especially if they offer discounts for using BTC.
Also worth noting, that those businesses can hold onto the BTC for a few days/weeks and with the growth at the moment, they will basically increase their profit margin on what they are selling.
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:35:54
yeah i bought a boat!
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:59:53
LOL and now its at $88.
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:01:25
I actually thought that localbitcoins.com acted as escrow for the transaction anyway. Guaranteeing that the bitcoins were going to be transferred?
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:22:41
all gone :( hahaha
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:44:05
There should be a website where we can list the dumbest bitcoin gambling websites. Could have a winner here.
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:06:35
bitcoin high rollers
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:36:02
and a helicopter
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:51:52
This seems to happen every weekend. It recovers within a couple days.
There is still a massive demand for BTC which is driving the purchasing up and down.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:39:33
standard weekend activity...
i am beginning to think some high roller with a couple hundred thousand, dumps 10-20K of their coin to fund lavish weekend trips.
@_date: 2013-03-24 02:05:51
haha yeah, could have, but wasn't.  
I was worried someone was playing me - they post that link, wait for someone to put credit in - and they withdraw it on me.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:04:42
1st world problem... I had to walk an extra couple blocks to find a coffee shop open in Sydney because of Good Friday.
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:48:48
wow someone is buying up a LOT of coins.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:21:53
i would be surprised if people aren't trying to coordinate things like this.
@_date: 2013-03-22 08:20:32
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:13:17
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:34:34
Sorry to hear!
Things like this totally suck.
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:54:13
I have been using Multibit for day to day transactions on my laptop.
I use the Blockchain mobile app on my iPhone.
I've created a couple of paper wallets and deposited a bunch of coin in there that I am holding on to for the long haul... mind you it isn't much. An amount I am happy to lose.
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:14:28
Multibit doesn't require the full chain. I rate it.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:32:38
So you're one of those people who jump on every *new thing* and buy up all the domains that sound remotely related.
Great career you've got there.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:03:13
awesome how did you do that? localbitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-02 07:04:03
I lol'd
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:23:52
I use block chain for day to day. Offline wallet for storage. And leave a bunch of coin in my mtgox
@_date: 2013-03-25 02:18:44
Either: $400 USD -- or $65USD
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:26:37
The upturn in the value shouldn't have any impact on how long transactions take. I think if more people are using the platform then that might put load on the network.
Honestly I think half the reason my transactions were slow was my choice of wallet (blockchain.info).
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:18:27
yeah it is going to keep happening. until the hype has settled this will be the norm for BTC. rallys, with drop offs every couple weeks.
Just have to take emotion out of the picture. Don't try make a quick buck, because you're buying and selling on emotion seeing it drop. Trading lag will end up biting you in the ass.
In a couple months I think the price will have steadied, and it will most likely be north of $100 USD. So whatever happens now doesn't matter.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:33:09
this also saves you from satoshidice and bitmillions and the likes...
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:12:00
I used MtGox to buy mine.
Localbitcoins.com are supposed to be good too!
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:46:43
It just seems like a dumb idea.
Who says that the whole concept isn't just a front to make 1st time players lose their money...
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:16:31
that didnt pay very much...
i guess we are only a little over 1 week into April.
I wouldnt have risked BTC on that bet though.
@_date: 2013-06-04 23:56:48
Ohh good to hear.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:37:58
This is not surprising at all, I don't think it hurts the credibility of the platform/idea.
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:35:20
You don't even need to sync the 6GB of data.
use Multibit or Blockchain.info if you just want to send it somewhere...
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:01:15
I've thought about doing it - I am sure there are people out there who have written bots to do it automatically so probably not much point as those bots will slowly equalise the market.
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:48:16
weird - take off the www. and it fails.
Thanks!
