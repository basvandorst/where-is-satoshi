If there were to be a solution, I'd imagine it'd have to make some massive changes to how Bitcoin works.
It is not my job to imagine such possibilities - that is the job of the developers. But between their track record on dealing with other important issues (the favored approach appears to be 'it's not a problem', the amount of time that has passed with proposal for a solution, and Gavin or whichever prominent developer it was saying 'I can only work on one thing at a time at the moment', I have my doubts about their competency.
The only other thing, which 'Romanizer' suggested to me here on the matter, is the possibility of compressing the size of transactions. Since the calculations are based on transactions being on average 500 bytes in size (1Mb block holding 24,000 transactions - a figure I took from the Bitcoin wiki), I personally don't believe there's much room if any for improvement on that.

Well, suppose you've got ~1 million transactions vying for a block, which is what you would get if Bitcoin matched Visa in terms of transactions. 
Although I said there were only two options, there is in fact a third option - the unthinkable option, because it would probably spell the end for Bitcoin, and that is to cap the blocks at say 1MB as is now, and you end up with the network coming to a near standstill with most users waiting forever for their transactions to go through a bottleneck.
So this is why I say there are only two options: Either get rid of the cap and allow the blockchain to bloat with low transaction fees, or you allow/enforce high transaction fees so that most people won't make transactions in the first place and few are stuck waiting forever.
I argue that you can't do the former to due to the limitations of infrastructure, so the only reasonable option is the latter.

Clearly you didn't read my original post. I state that miners' fees will increase (that's part of the point), and I talk about off-chain transactions. 'Off-chain transactions' is just an obscure way of saying you'll pool your resources into one centralized entity in order to conserve the amount of transactions. Hell, using Paypal is a form of 'off-chain transaction' if you think about it, by definition!


Yes, because that worked well with shares in Neo&amp;Bee didn't it? MtGox anyone? They had an incentive! An incentive to make money off fees, there's no way they can do anything wrong!


[citation needed]
I provide my math in a comment above/below, now where's yours?
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:16:54
I'm glad you asked. I have the calculations ready, but did not want to make the post too long.
I start by using a figure found in the Bitcoin wiki which you can lookup for yourself: A 1MB block can hold 2400 transactions.
This may or may not be generous, but lets be conservative and take it as granted.
Now according to the [Visa website]( they 'handle an *average* of 150 million transactions every day'.
That equates to 1736.11 transactions per second.
A block is created every 10 minutes. So, 1736.11 x 60 seconds x 10 minutes = 1,041,666.66 transactions per block to match Visa.
Using the aforementioned 1MB = 2400 transactions figure, 1,041,666.66 divided by 2400 = 434.03MB per block.
Now for the last part, regarding Nodes uploading at least 5GB. I did a search here for posts from people running nodes. What I found is that currently they are uploading 10 times as much as they download. So I simply calculate 500MB x 10 = 5GB. I have also seen a possible example of up to ~75x as much uploaded, but I have been as conservative as possible and have used the 10x figure.

You appear to be talking about a consumer internet connection. I am talking about submarine cable bandwidth. They are two completely different things.
Not to mention that a 1.544mb/s (What Google says your American 'T1' jargon is) synchronous connection isn't even sufficient for the figures I calculate.
I am talking about the future, when/if Bitcoin rivals Visa. You are talking about the present without regards to the future.
Here, do some reading. Educate yourself:


MtGox was the largest and oldest Bitcoin exchange. They were no 'amateurs', at least not relative to others involved within Bitcoin.
The fact is that incentive does not necessarily deter irrational acts that constitute a fraudulent or even existential threat.


Please do explain further how 'Open Transactions and multisig addresses' operate in a decentralized manner whilst also doing away with the problems of blockchain bloat and transaction fees.
Not just for my benefit, but for the benefit of anyone else reading.

But that is the all-important change. You say 'you're going to have sky-high fees even prior to this floating fee patch', but that is not true because the minimum fee was fixed as you yourself say it was.


Well I'm glad you acknowledge that, but what do you make of the implications I have laid out? Do you think that Bitcoin will one day rival Visa? If so, how can the problems associated with blockchain bloat possibly be averted?
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:05:30
A lot of people here believe that Bitcoin will overtake the world and at least match Visa in possibly 2-5 years, no?
I don't believe it is likely you will be able to compress transactions into sizes less than the current 500 bytes, and internet bandwidth is both expensive and time-consuming to create infrastructure for.
International submarine cables for instance cost tens of billions of dollars to lay. This says nothing of the end-user costs a person running a node would face, and without mention of the fact that nodes are run for free without reward.

What about them?
If you mean they could be used as substitutes for microtransactions and the like, or to dilute the pool of transactions so to speak, it wouldn't work.
The second way I put there is more revealing - because it's obvious that altcoins would only suffer the same fate once they become as popular as Bitcoin (as they are designed no different, at least as of now), but also if you dilute transactions over a number of different coins, it's all still going to add up to the total amount of bandwidth that has to pass around throughout the world which is really at the crux of the matter.

You obviously did not even read the full length of the post.
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:54:53
My argument is neither that hard-coded fees are better or worse, that's quite irrelevant to my point - I merely point out that this recent move to have floating fees is a way to avoid inevitable blockchain bloat, but a move that will also mean that fees will increase over time if Bitcoin transactions grow.
In regards to blockchain pruning - that is fine for removing blockchain data *after* it is downloaded and freeing up hard drive space, but nodes still have to download/upload the blockchain in full (in real-time) and that is the killer. Internet bandwidth is a much bigger challenge than hard drive capacity in my view.
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:35:56
Care to explain how?
It's no good burying your head in the sand and hoping for the best.
I suggest you look up the bandwidth limitations of internet infrastructure, particularly submarine infrastructure. You'll find that it is not only extremely expensive, but creating new infrastructure is process that takes a number of years or even decades.

Just fyi, those edits by me were made before or at the same time as you edited your post. 
The two errors contained in the original were merely typos/had no effect on the calculations themselves, which you can verify for yourself. I point this out because I assume the reason you cited my post in yours was for these errors.
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:37:32
What do you mean 'deleted'?
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:39:29
That is why I edited my post. If you go to the Visa website you will see for yourself that the correct figure is 150 million transactions, not 150,000 transactions. It was a simple typo on my part which I quickly corrected afterwards.
EDIT: I did not realize the '24,000' error as well. This should be 2,400. But I will now double check.
EDIT2: Yes, I have confirmed it is 2,400 - so there is nothing wrong with the calculations. The reason I made some mistakes in my post is because I am merely repeating verbatim from memory some calculations I did a few days ago.
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:25:26


Would this not be in effect, regional blocking?
Throttling the bandwidth based on geography sounds alarming to me. I haven't thought it through, though I'd like to hear your thoughts on how it'd work.

Clearly you didn't learn much by yourself
At least, that's what I've garnered from your responses both today and in the past.
