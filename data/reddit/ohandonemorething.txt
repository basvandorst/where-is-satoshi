($19,500 + $10,418 + $9,155 + $9,677) / 4 = $12,187.50

The point is, if you feel like you made a mistake and don't have the stomach for the volatility, you have a much better chance at selling your 4 btc and leaving the market at a small profit or at a much smaller loss than either selling your 1 btc at a $9,500 loss or hoping the market eventually gets all the way back to $20,000
Of course this entire strategy assumes you can afford to play in the first place. If OP spent 100% of his money to buy in at the top, he should have read the disclaimer. Everybody wants to get rich and no one is taking the time to follow the rules of investing. If OP asked himself prior to buying, "Does a $19k btc have value?" and the answer was Yes, then he shouldn't have a problem using DCA because he finds the current price less than the value he assigned when he bought. If the answer was "No" he shouldnt have bought it.

We're overdue for a big ass correction, but as long as it trends up and the analysis looks healthy there's no predicting when. A 38.2 % correction would take us down to $9,612  but who's to say it doesn't raise to $25k before a 38.2% correction, which would be $17,181.09
etc etc

If it's that big a deal, you shouldn't be buying Bitcoin in the first place..that's part of his point. Investments aren't for broke people that can't afford to eat, that's just common sense. 
"Hmm, I haven't eaten today, I better put this $3.75 in my 401k"

It's a part of technical Analysis..Look up Elliott Waves and Fibonacci Retracement
They are theories of how psychology of the buyer has just as much to do with the price increases/decreases of a market (basically FOMO pushes price higher, FUD pulls price down, etc)
Basically when the price is at any low point and starts going up, you get a 5-part wave that goes Up, Down, Up, Down, Up. So it might go from $1 to $30 to $15 to $60 to $35 to $100
The idea is that by the time you get to $100, there are excited buyers in the market just trying to get in on the increase, so there's no solid basis for the price, thus it's inevitable the market correct itself from the buyers getting carried away. For some crazy reason, when the price comes back down, there is quite often a pattern where it falls exactly 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8% of the way back to where the increase started. (EX: The uptrend stopped at $100, so it retraces 38.2% and the price ends at $62.80)

Definitely. If the current price was $15,400 and you had 100 BTC set to sell with a limit order at $16,000 and the buying pressure is pushing the price right towards you, why in the hell would you cancel your order and relist it at $15,401???

thats BS..I was in the middle of selling 1 btc for like 19,600 and it went retarded..by the time the page would load its at like 15k..

It might. If you know the Fibonacci numbers, it can help you buy on a dip with confidence if the price is at 38.2%, 50% or 61.8% of the previous bull wave.
Otherwise if the price drops by more than those numbers you can analyze it as a crash instead of a dip

Here's what I want to know...Does that year reset every time the price goes up? If I have 1 BTC that I bought for $125, and 5 BTC that I bought in pieces over the last 3 years at prices ranging from $500 to $17000 per, if I sell everything at $20k..
how the f do I calculate what percentage of my earnings were from coins I held for more than a year? Especially if I made 100's of day trades in between

It depends. I think it's a risk unless you clearly are explaining things step by step to help them learn. Shit my brother is 20 and I've got him in but he's in college and my mom asked me to chill out because he was trying to invest money he needed for his bills cause of FOMO and big gains.
I didn't really pull back, but he and I talk several times a week and I explain the reasoning behind the price action, show him TA charts and explain fundamental analysis, how news affects trends, market psychology, and general investing advice that I've learned from being involved in my decade of investing.
What I stress to him and I think is really important is emphasizing to young investors is BE PATIENT. Put in what you can afford to lose, or like OP's nephew track a gifted amount and take time to learn how markets work. You are too young and you don't have the disposable income to really take advantage of this killer opportunity. Your time will come, use cryptocurrency to prepare for the next big thing. 
I was 24 when the housing crisis started and I had just started a new career that was paying $42k, had a part-time working for a new apartment complex that covered 85% of my rent, and had no student loans.  I could've made a fortune if I'd saved responsibly, studied up on housing and made a killing. Houses I looked at in shady neighborhood that I "predicted" would turn around are worth 6-10x what they cost in 2009. By the time I seriously started to realize what was happening I was priced out of the market. But I learned a lot from talking to people that knew how things worked. I started saving and waiting for the next big thing.
10 years later ... opportunity knocks again. Now it's my turn. This is why I'm teaching little brother about crypto.

Only if you sell right now. The point is that with DCA, you only need the price to reach around $12k and you can sell everything and break even.
With that one btc purchased at $19,500, you need the market to go up almost 100% to break even.
Which of those two do you think is more likely??

As long as you still have them, absolutely!

You on Mac or PC?
You can go into the actual files and find the debug.log
For example, on a Mac:
Open Finder. Go to Home -&gt; Library -&gt; Application Support -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt;debug.log
