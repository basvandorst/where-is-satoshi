Whao, I was just going for some comical relief... I wasn't intending to make you feel ridiculed.
I was serious about losing coins too though it wasn't to a Nigerian prince. I don't have any smart ideas on how to get bitcoins in America, I live in Australia and I use spendbitcoins.com to buy mine which is super easy. Also be careful with bitcoins on ebay. It's usually a bad combination.  &amp; &amp;

What part of Australia? It's a big place! Western Australia is well worth a visit and I'd be happy to give you some travel ideas and line up some accom for btc. There's quite a few Canadians living here in Perth actually:)   &amp; &amp;

It's common to buy them pre-made in the Uk too, and then store them in a bread-bin or a cupboard. I guess maybe the additional heat in Australia affects your Crumpets life span...   &amp; &amp;

Not generally. For most currencies, their value on FX markets is export driven. If you want to buy Australian iron ore you need to buy AUd, this bids the price up. Those Australians buying Chinese goods are selling AUd, the market finds the price.
bitcoin has no real exports. You could argue silk road, but they're priced in fiat, their supply chain requires fiat - they're only using bTC to transfer fiat. This is massively different. It's a buy order of bTC immediately followed by a sell order, it ought be price neutral.  &amp; &amp;

I live in Australia so im not too sure how accurate this is.. but I watched a documentary on youtube a little while ago it was about how there is nonlegal requirement of anyone living within the u.s to pay income tax. There is no actual law ?  &amp; &amp;

Guys, you'll wanna be careful here. Anonymous donations to policial parties aren't really allowed in Australia. You'll need to get disclosure of identity for any donations, and report them to the AEC over the disclosure limit.  &amp; &amp;

there were plenty of exchanges in Australia at one point then disappeared through self-goxxing. remember cryptoxchange? 
technocash is also wary of bitcoin and doesn't want anybody to use them for bTC transactions, basically gox fucked this up for all australians when they got banned by technocash. you can get around this by making up a fake game gold card called dErPGOLd with it's own website and then sell that for technocash AUd. have your exchange accept 'derpGold' as a payment method and link to your other site. win  &amp; &amp;

So as a US citizen, what potential downsides are there to signing up for an IG markets account in Australia or britain? Seems like you could lie about where you live, but that you could get hosed by that further down the road.  &amp; &amp;

;tl&amp; but the average person on has already given all of their identifying information to Mt.Gox/bit-whatever and has linked their bank account to an exchange account.
If the average person on r/bitcoin has enough savvy to get bitcoins, they might have enough savvy to anonymize them also.
but we both know...they probably don't.
