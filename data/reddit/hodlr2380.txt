if you think bitcoin is worthless then why are you here?

I think it would be used more if trade limits were raised, currently max for a trade is 0.25btc , i hope this can be lifted in the future - it would be alot more popular.

1) I want to give adequate time for all the VC investments / startups from the past 18months to bear fruit ...
2) I want the blocksize issue settled and the limit raised, im sure given some time after this is done, the price per btc will rise too as the network will  become more efficient/valuable.
3) I wanted to wait at least 1 or 2 years after the the halvening next year - 
but now i think about it, if i wait 2 years after the upcoming halvening, i might aswell buckle in and wait out the next halvening too. When i do decide to sell it will be gradually over some years .. aslong as everything goes to plan!
This is going to be a long ride , but im absolutely positive aside from a major nuclear war / technological disaster ... prices will be 1000-1500$ by my target date ... ( i even think thats low ) 
ARE YOU WITH ME BROTHERS?

electrum with extended custom seed words will be bulletproof , keep the custom words seperate from seed, or even inside ur head. this has served me well for years now. hardware wallet also good option but then theres a physical device which would make it obvious you hold crypto i prefer no device needed and electrum has always served me well. -- use with tails operating system, electrum comes pre installed. bulletproof :)
