no fees? sure.... little fees? not so much, sure a miner or 2 will refuse them, but as long as their is a miner willing to pick up the bitcents, they will be transactions, which keeps the fees low. Only if all miners refuse the trasactions, will that work, and I don't believe that is possible in reality.

That is the same as 2-step verification. Coinbase already does this without any multisig options.
Also, assuming 3-5 approval scenario, what if two non-automated individuals approved it, vetoing the auto-sig? As far as I can see, multi-sig just increases the chance of human-engineered* attacks.

I was trying to illustrate why bitcoin is still useful even if small transactions are done using Coinbase. Of course people using a payment processor would not receive many of the benefits. I'm just saying bitcoin would still thrive without the need for small transactions in the blockchain.

What I wanna know is why would someone approve sending funds? Sitting around and approving money transfers sounds boring.
Also how would this be more secure? If a hacker got into someones account and send money to another address, how would the other approvers know in time?

I don't agree with that proposal. The biggest reason is fees. Sure miners get paid by new bitcoins for now, but eventually will depend on fees. If max block size is increased, then there is no incentive to pay fees and then we won't have miners in any real sense and bitcoin's security/decentralization is at risk. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:55:20
This post is more talking to myself, but thanks mr.e for the replys.
hmm, but then how is multi-sig more secure than single-sig? Auto-sig can be vetoed away (which is necessary in case you wanna send more than your limit) by the non-auto....Which I suppose is ok if the other approvers go to such lengths as calling you or taking extra steps rather than approve willy nilly. Hmmm, I suppose a 2-3 sig can work if one company supplys the auto-approval and the other is in charge of verification. Athough that has it's own issues. Well it is an interesting problem never-the-less, and could be made to work...maybe.

Lets say there is someone who has a few bitcoin saved for whatever reason. So later he decides he needs some things from walmart. Thinking about it, it would be really easy to use some of those bitcoins to buy a giftcard from gyft, and get 3% back. With a debit card, he does not get any rewards. So why would he use debit in this situation? 
Also, no individuals mine these days, everyone buys bitcoins now. It would be like complaining that an apple is sooo hard to get, cause you have to plant a seed, wait for months, and finnally getting apples. Just buy an apple at a store. Let companys mine bitcoins, just buy them, its way easier.

I was referring to a future fee payment after we reach 1mb sized blocks, which will necessarily push fees higher and a 0.1 fee could be commonplace. It was just an arbitrary number, hence the "or whatever". I have no idea what size the fees would be in such a scenario other than that they would be moderately sized.

If 10% of the network will push though any transaction, it would take on average 10 blocks or about an hour and a halfish. Also this "handful" of people would have to agree to the minimum fee somehow and resist the temptation of scooping those tempting 0.19 transactions. .

@_date: 2014-10-08 02:14:57
It still kinda does. With the limit as it is now, you might be forced to do a fee of 0.1 btc or whatever to transfer funds. If the limit was raised, no one gets excluded from the block and as long as you sent any amount of btc, the miner is going to include you out of self-interest. 
People doing minor transactions might have to use a centralized payment processor like Coinbase, but so what?
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:13:50
The key word being "Federal Reserve". It is not responsible for regulation, but other parts of the government are able to regulate Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a "generic good" and has different rules that govern it. All that stuff you have to deal with when getting the bitcoins largly has to do with this:

It would depend on if there was a backlog....if there is, then i have no real problem with a increased block size (cause we would have fees)....but isn't the point of this 50% increase per year to get rid of it?
What I was showing was that price fixing is impossible in bitcoin. If the small miners pick up the small fees, no price fixing. 
Finally, I suppose i would not mind a bigger block size if a backlog would still exist, however, I am not sure that can be achieved with something as semi-random as a 50% increase annually. I certainly think something as risky as a hard-fork is not worth a guaranteed backlog at 1mb.

Arbitrage. It is the act of buying the lower price on one exchange and selling the larger price on a different exchange. if one coin is 10$ on one and 11$ on another, you buy the 10$ one and sell the 11$ one. 11$ - 10$ = 1$ profit. People use bots to do this automatically and is "free" money.

1. so with hash power it depends on the type of attack. Either an attack from the inside with miners that mine cryptocurrenies or an attack from the outside like some government spending billions to build a massive computer farm to attack crypto. For an attack on the inside, it does not matter how much hash power we have as long as one miner never gets 51% or higher of it. For an outside attack, the total hashpower is very important, as the more hashpower we have, the more the attacker would have to spend in order for an attack to even work. So yes, a big mining operation is good for outside attacks, not if the miner decides to attack tho.
2. the death spiral is just fud, the miners care about what to mine cause that is the literal purpose of it, to acquire as much money as possible, so they will mine the most profitable coin as long as they expect that coin to have value for some time. at least a week id guess. miners leaving or joining a coin does not change it's profitability. only mining difficulty/fees/price of coin.
3. people dont view big miners favorably, for the exact reasons you just said. but they are not going away as long as other people are not able to compete with them.
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:59:31
yep, people using that technique will cause buying pressure on the exchange with the cheaper coins causing the price to rise, and selling pressure on the more expensive exchange causing the price to fall. That ,as you say, will cause price parity.

Gold didnt become worthless just because cash did. If it takes one gold nugget to buy a house, then after the cash crash, you could still buy the house using one gold nugget. Since cash is so popular and frequently used, it is easy to use it as a measurement of value. If it crashes, we would, like you said just use another form of currency.

I am limited in my knowledge of Trezor, but I do believe it is just a portable computer that stores your addresses and private keys, and cuts out a lot of the hassle. It does it in a way that no one but you can access this info, no secret back doors. That being said, I dont know much and I recommend the Trezor website or other bitcoin users on reddit for more info. 
There are many online wallets and it is all different for each. I do believe most are as insecure as exchanges cause you have trust the software of the wallet not to mess with you. 
Personally I use  's downloadable page to make addresses. And have several bitcoin in several addresses, and then when I need to use them I just upload the private key onto on wallet, when I wanna use them and make a new address and move the remaining balance onto it when I am done. That being said, I do have some bitcoin on coinbase for most of the small stuff, so I don't need to do all this every time. I just consider that small part of bitcoin to be unsafe/potentially lose able.

and no users like 2x, miners have to mine on the most profitable coin. If it has no users, then they will stop mining 2x. So it becomes a test of wills, do miners risk millions per day mining a worthless coin or do users move to a coin that is actually making transactions? no one knows. This all assumes that the miners don't chicken out and actually make a hardfork in november.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:42:13
and in the current climate it costs a couple dollars to send any bitcoin transaction. No one is going to be able to deposit pennies until 2nd layer payments are common.

On the extanges bit, yes any bitcoin held on an exchange can be stolen from you. Which is why there are countless threads here saying not to have large amounts on them. Luckly for us, we dont need to give our bitcoins to anyone. All bitcoin is in bitcoin addresses, and as long as you have the private key, you are in COMPLETE control of them, no one can take them from you willingly. Only 1ish percent of my bitcoin is in coinbase for convience, the rest are stored safely in cold storage.
As for ownership, they would not be able to get them all, the price would rise dramatically and eventally price them out. A lot of people would not willing part there bitcoins as well, for one reason or another, not all bitcoins are for sale if people dont sell them.

You pretty much have it all spot on for the most part.

Think about this more. Imagine there are 4 people selling each selling 1 bitcoin, each one is selling at different price, 50$,100$,150$,200$ . Imagine at the same time there are 3 people buying one bitcoin each, and willing to pay 40$ 50$ and 100$. In this scenario, 2 bitcoin changes hands at prices 50$ and 100$. In this case the current price of bitcoin would be considered 75$.

@_date: 2017-08-18 00:55:36
No doubt some users will move to 2x, but only a small portion use it to buy goods, so all the ones who use it to store value stay on the main chain. 90% of people would stay.
and no the miners would not go to bch, cause of the exact same reason. Mining bch is unprofitable, and when it does, the massive increase of hashing power will rise the difficulty until it becomes unprofitable again. This would take a day or so at best cause blocks would be found realllly quickly. So miners will go back to the one that is time tested to be a money maker, bitcoin.

There is going to be a ton of growth including future softforks, have you seen the core roadmap? Things they want include is an eventual 16mb hardfork, assuming user agreement.  
also glad you just follow along with the crowd aka "theme". When I first saw bitcoin years ago, I saw those 1mb blocks (before anyone cared about it) and did not believe hard forks were ever actually gonna happen. The writing on the wall showed that paying for your coffee via bitcoin was never gonna happen. Reality does not care about your beliefs.

one public address are matched to one private key, they are different, they should not look the same. You can make infinite amount of public/private pairs.

Well do keep in mind what you are asking is a hard question. You are asking is why is anything valuable at all. Whole economic books have been written asking this very question, and not everyone agrees either.
That being said, the value in my opinion, is based on two things. Feel free to skip to the second reason if you know this one. The first is simple supply and demand. if one bitcoin is sold, and one person wants a bitcoin for 100$ then it is worth 100$. However, if someone else learns about bitcoin, and wants it as well, but instead wants it for 200$, our bitcoin seller obviously will sell it for 200$, therefor bitcoin is worth 200 because demand went up while supply was the same. Now just imagine that with more sellers and buyers and as long as the people demanding bitcoin outgrow the sellers of bitcoin, the price will go up naturally.
Now we get into the second reason and your actual question, why do people buy bitcoin at all, and why would bitcoin be valued during financial trouble. Well, unless you give me a good reason why you think bitcoin will become centralized, I don't agree with you and personally believe that it will always be decentralized. The core developers are working hard on making that be always true. Anyway, bitcoin being decentralized and deflationary are the reasons most people buy it. I buy bitcoin because no one can take it from me, and am willing to pay for the privilege. People also buy bitcoin because it is a safe haven. During a financial bust, if you wanna sell your house or car or other valuables, why would you buy the increasingly worthess cash? People would be wanting safe havens like gold and bitcoin. Heck even people with cash and stocks are trying to get rid of them as they become more useless. Some of these people are going to buy bitcoin, and thus increase the demand, and raise the price.
That there, is what the price of bitcoin would be based on.

If your talking about how long a transaction would take to be included into the next block and you choose an arbitrary time to send the transaction aka not immediately after a block has been found.
In that case, it would still be 10 minutes on average. just because a block has not been found it does not mean it sucks up some random average time limit and gets included sooner. If you flip a coin 10 times and they all come up heads, what is the odds you get a head next flip? 50%, the fact that they all came up heads does not change the odds. Even if a block has not been found recently, at that point in time it still takes 10 minutes on average to find a block and 10 minues on average for your transaction to go into it.

EDA is a flawed system, At current rates, the reward per block halfs in 250 days, EDA pushes the difficulty down by large amounts, causing this massive block mining to happen again. This goes on and on for the next few years, and then there are no/negligible amounts of BCH for mining a block, In which case (pay attention to this part, its important) the only way to get a transaction though is by paying a large fee!!! No miner is going to mine a block without some reward. So either pay a fee or else change the system to extend the block rewards.....by increasing the 21 million coin cap. ��

Bitcoin cannot be hacked, bitcoin has been around for years, and has plenty of enemies. They have all failed to hack it.


How does this cause centralization?

because 2x has no upsides, running a node becomes harder, hardforks cause massive problems and and should only be used in emergenies, segwit should solve the block size problem for the foreseeable future, so we don't need to increase the size more.

Make sure the wallet has fully downloaded the blockchain first or use a light wallet. Use the send button to send to other addresses. No coin? well....
Acquire bitcoin by buying it at coinbase.com or somewhere similar. They should have ways to send your bought bitcoin to bitcoin addresses. It can be sent to the address you just made or one that I give you if you wanna give one to me instead. You could also do it the classic way by providing a service and having that person pay/giving you bitcoin.

This is where the fallacy is i believe. Not everyone in an economic crash becomes poor, rich people still existed in times like the great depression. lets say, someone needed to sell their mansion during a economic crises. Why sell it for cash or stocks when they are becoming more worthless by the day. They would sell it for bitcoin, which would cause the price to go up.

You are not. It is called being pseudonymous. You can be anonymous if you are very careful about it, but if someone figures out what address you control, then you are not anonymous. Using exchanges and whatnot, then obviously that makes it real easy to figure out what addresses you use.

Well, it's not gonna happen till sometime in November, So I'd at least wait until October before asking this question. Assuming it even happends, they might not go though with it. That being said, probably the best thing to do is wait until the fork and at a good time sell the 2x coins to drive the price down. As long as the economic majority don't use the segwit2x, it will be fine.

I don't like spending money cause it "hurts". I always hoard dollars, to say nothing of bitcoin. However, recently cause of the price boom, I have had a quite a bit more money availible. I recently checked the price of reddit gold. .005ish??? That is so low compared to what it used to be. So I went and gave one out. Painless due to the lower cost.

Great site :) 
Some complaints however...
* The view links are below the items...but closer to the item below than above. It took me a second to figure out why I was viewing cards that I did not care about.
* prices in cash? I mean ok, sure thats good....but bitcoin prices as well would be nice
* maybe I am just unlucky, but many single cards (and I think a few pack options) are comeing up as out of stock..while business is booming is great and all... I sadly am past my mtg obsession, but this would be  very frustrating if i was planning on buying the cards.
* I don't buy many things online so maybe I am just ignorant.... but I am utterly confused as what the bots even are????
* Putting a box or grid around the items (including the price and view links) would be better looking I think.
