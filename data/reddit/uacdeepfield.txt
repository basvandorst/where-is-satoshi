If you can’t actually get IN to the wallet you can re-generate it in a new program via the private keys and then send them to your fresh uncompromised wallet. 
Basically you just dont want to be storing anything in a compromised wallet long term. So regenerate it briefly and then empty it into a fresh wallet.

A Ledger Nano S is most secure. Just make sure you buy it directly from Ledger. Theyre on backorder for now though. 
Second to that - Electrum is really good as a desktop wallet. Just make sure your computer is malware free and when you back your seed up write it down on paper and hide it. Never type it anywhere. 
Also NO - reusing your compromised keys is NOT secure. You need a fresh seed with freshly generated wallets. 
Good luck. I hope you find a fortune there. Update us with what happens!

@_date: 2018-01-27 01:38:43
Do not reuse your seed. The seed if compromised is the root of all your wallet addresses. Reusing the same seed is effectively using the same wallet. 
You need to let your new desktop wallet or hardware wallet generate fresh addresses based off a brand new seed it will create for you. Do not reuse anything. 
Create a fresh wallet and seed in Electrum - then SEND the coins from your old wallet to the new wallet through a standard transaction.

But the fact that it’s rare doesnt mean it has more intrinsic value. Thats what he was getting at. If ‘intrinsic value’ is as relevant as people claim then gold should be worth a fraction of what water is worth. 
Thats why saying an asset is worthless because it has no intrinsic value is retarded.

The fact that you think volatility = worthless asset makes it easy to dismiss what youre saying.

@_date: 2018-01-27 01:24:29
Right but the remote possibility is enough to consider it compromised. 
As a rule of thumb your private seed and private keys should never be entered anywhere on anything connected to the internet ever. Like EVER. Unless you plan to sweep the wallet and discard it right away. 
My best advice is hire somebody to attempt to fix the drive in front of you so if/when it begins working you can transfer your coins to a different secure wallet on the spot. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:09:55
Again - this is a good thing. Not a bad thing. It signals that crypto is reaching the masses beyond cyphergeeks.

You should never store assets on an exchange unless you're daytrading and are experienced and comfortable with the risk. 
If the exchange were to vanish tomorrow your coins would too. Like with what happened with Mt. Gox. Definitely worth reading about if you haven't already. 
When your coins are on an exchange you technically don't own the private keys to them. 
Not your private keys, not your Bitcoin.
A software wallet is safer but not the safest. 
A Trezor or Ledger are your best options as these will always keep the seed isolated from your computer and are never 'online'.

Its about money on the surface - but the fact that none of these men NEED to pump it to get rich is the point I was making. And that fact should cause people to look beyond the profit and see why they’re really so bitter with Core.
Look at their personalities. Theyre textbook narcissists who dont like being questioned or cornered with logic or facts and when they are they throw temper tantrums. 
If you think the only reason theyre shilling their altcoins is to make some extra money youre missing the plot. Theyre after power. None of them have to work another day in their lives. Men with that type of money dont work so hard to fight a competing project unless the power of saying they did so is at the end of the tunnel.

Its important to note that at this point - it would be a race between you and the thief. If the thief spends the coins in your wallet BEFORE you are able to recover it - youre fucked. 
Also - even if you recover it - the wallet and the entire seed and all its adresses should be considered compromised and all assests should be transfered to a fresh walled generated from a NEW SEED entirely. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. A different address within the same wallet generated from the same seed will not do. 
This is an essential part of recovery but is seldom mentioned. Recovery alone is not enough.

The whole point is that the Ledger generates the seed offline and keeps it offline forever.
If you use an old seed theres a chance that seed has already been compromised. Then at any time somebody with that same seed can generate your wallet anywhere in the world. 
The whole point of a Ledger is to let the Ledger create a fresh seed from scratch.

Its actually a lot less complicated than ppl think. Once you sell your first amount and transfer it to your bank account you see how simple it really is. 
Sometimes hearing it explained makes it sound way more daunting than it is. If you can bank online you can sell coin on an exchange. 
The only thing is most exchanges have limits - where you can only transfer $500,000 per week or something like that. 
So if youre selling $2 million worth of Bitcoin - it may take several seperate withdrawls spread out over a few weeks. But thats only when youre dealing in 6 and 7-figure amounts. At which point youre too happy that youre rich to care about being impatient :)

Or all $50,000 if you like. 
I chose that range because it leaves you with a nice little chunk of guaranteed money should everything go to shit. Bitcoin - and any crypto - is probably the most risky volatile thing youll ever invest in in your life. 
Worth putting some but not EVERYTHING you own into. Imagine it tanked to nothing tomorrow - you could say “hey at least i still have that $40k sitting there” instead of “i have nothing left” 
But there are people who have literally not only gone all in but taken out loans to go more all in. And it has paid off for many people - but that doesnt mean it always will. 
10-15% of a big chunk of money is enough to see some returns and still let you sleep at night knowing no matter what theres some guaranteed savings.

FUD means fear, uncertainty and doubt.
You have it backwards. The more people that own Bitcoin the more valuable it becomes. The supply of bitcoin is limited and although divisible - it's still deflationary as there will only ever be 21 million coins mined and we're not even there yet. 
Could you invest now? Sure. at around $7500 per coin (or parts of a coin at the respective rate)
But many people bought coins for $2000, $1000, $500, $10. And this really burns people.
Knowing you could've made in the tens - even hundreds - of millions had you just not dismissed Bitcoin is something some people have a hard time living with - so they try and dismiss it now and spread fear to sooth their wounds. 
So whenever I hear negative talk I just assume it's the latter. Maybe that's not your intention, but there's so many ignorant people out there that it's hard not to just assume that's what they're about.

But yes by law you will have to report profits earned when you cash out. 
There are ways to keep identity out of it. You could buy via Bitcoin ATMs and sell it privately and locally. The buying is easy (aside from the high fees youll pay) - but the selling gets tricky. However there is a site called localbitcoins that facilitates private Bitcoin sales I think. I have no experience with it though.

Adopting a change and forking off into an entirely different coin on a totally seperate blockchain arent even remotely the same thing. Not to be a dick but if youre being sincere - you have much to learn about the way this technology works before you make claims about what is and isnt the true Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:29:22
You bet against Bitcoin and you get steamrolled. Never forget.

Many merchants accept Bitcoin. 
Even Microsoft accepts Bitcoin. 
Nobody accepts gold. Yet is gold worthless? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:41:01


Yes. But everyone isn't cashing out are they? You see small dips here and there when large sells occur, price dips for a bit, then climbs again as more people buy. 
If Bitcoin was at risk of a mass cash out from every holder then you would've seen it happen long ago. 
It's like saying "isn't gold worthless if nobody wants it?" Yes. But people do want it. It's rare and it's limited, like Bitcoin.


Then you should really educate yourself on what it is and the technology that underlies it. Once you know what's up - then form an opinion.

I guess thats true too. Im not an expert on advanced trading so maybe its best i dont have this chance lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:54:13
Youve been able to use it as currency for years now. Many merchants accept it. Microsoft accepts it. More and more merchants accept it everyday. 
And soon CME will trade Bitcoin futures. Its being taken very seriously now. Loooooong gone are the days where people only looked at is as some magical internet money. When Wall Street is talking about it and beginning to incorporate it - its no longer a joke.

The news of the s2x cancellation signals a new wave of stability, resilience and confidence in not just Bitcoin - but the community as well. 
This will drown out the paper thin money that flowed in and out for a few free 2x bucks in due time. The next few weeks will see the price trend upwards. These ppl that were just in and out for s2x are meaningless.

It has crashed before. It will crash again. It still doesnt stop it. 
Also it isnt speculative. Its a limited supply deflationary means of exchange. Thats not a speculaion thats a fact. Its also immutable which is fact.

So yeah - it aint going away. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:39:44
Even with these 8 or 9 figure purchases its still nowhere near what would be considered a dangerously large amount for one entity to hold - but those buys are big enough to drive the price upwards.

Quadrigas trading engine is just rock solid. Its a simple easy to understand layout. Its just a great exchange for Canadian residents. 
The verification with sending ID , holding credit card in a selfie etc etc is VERY common across all types of exchanges. I know - its freaky the first time youre asked for all this stuff but I promise you its very run of the mill. Im registered with 3 different exchanges and they ALL do this. As long as the exchanges are reputable (which quadriga is) its nothing to be afraid of. Its just part of the KYC (know your customer) practices these companies have to follow. Its just legal shit to cover their ass.

There's 21 million coins that will ever exist. 
If you own 21 coins then you're part of a club that only 1 million people can possibly be part of. (21x1000000=21million)

Its real alright. 
The demand for a store of value amidst the chaos down there has basically driven the already sought after Bitcoin to new levels. Its the ONLY thing theyre hanging onto. This makes it worth even more. 
Im sure theres a more sophisticated explaination but thats the gist of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:02:37
Of course. Anything thats deflationary is by definition going to grow in value. Its what you want in an asset.

Don't let it bother you. When something is King - doses of imitation and resentment are a natural outcome.

The situation you described is exactly what always happens. 
Price dips. Or crashes. Then rockets back up. In 2014 it lost over 70% of its value. Did that stop it? Nope. Earlier this year China banned exchange operations. China is the mecca of Bitcoin. Surely that killed it right? Nope. Dipped and then slingshotted even higher.
So when people blah blah blah about it being a bubble just smile and nod. They’ve probably never touched it in their life and dont even know what a bubble really is. Same with people who call it a ‘scam’ or ‘Ponzi scheme’. They lack understanding of what both are. 
So will it correct after this massive bullrun? Yes. Almost certainly. But thats a good thing in the long run. Dips arent to be feared. Dips arent doom. If a 70% crash and Chinese ban couldnt kill Bitcoin a pullback after reaching over $11,000USD is a joke at this point.

Not sure what that has to do with anything I said....
I didn't discuss the rarity of modern Lamborghinis at all. 
Also the notion that just because a 10 year old exotic costs only $80,000 and is therefore "affordable" is laughable. Usually people who say this don't have any experience with exotics. 
A clutch job alone on an 06 Gallardo requires the cars entire rear panel to be dismantled, exhaust dismantled/removed, and then put back together once the new clutch plates are fitted. The cost? around $7,000 - $9,000 US. For a single clutch replacement. 
There is no such thing as a cheap Lamborghini. And because somebody can buy an $80,000 Toyota does NOT mean they can afford to purchase, drive and maintain a used Lamborghini just because it may have a similar sticker price at the time.
There's soooo MUCH more to being able to "afford" a car than just paying the sticker. 
Word to the wise.
edit: and it's "Countach" 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:55:31
Depends what you want. 
100% electric and untouchable 0-60 times? Tesla. 
Jaw-dropping exotic styling, Nurburgring worthy performance/handling and frightening top speeds? Lambo everytime. 
Teslas are only quick to 60mph - after that almost every exotic eats them for lunch. 
Edit: also the howl of a Lamborghini's exhaust is almost reason enough to take the Lambo. HNNNNNNG.
Tesla can have fun being all silent and electric all it likes but there's no replacement for that sound.

Is there any truth to this bullshit? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:02:04
I agree. That's why its dumb to say one is better. It all depends what you want out of the car. They're completely different machines. 
Teslas are amazing though I'd daily drive one in a heartbeat. But the common misconception people have that they're faster make me lol. Go race a Lambo in your P100d and see what happens when that Lambo hits 4th gear.

I'm just saying that suggesting how long term holders with rooted faith in the technology who have been here for 3+ years now are not going to 'jump ship' to an altcoin just because of some choppy waters is nonsense.

Right then every time they reference their altcoin it should be referred to as “Totally not Bitcoin” or “Bcash”. They try and get slippery by introducing it as Bitcoin Cash then casually dropping the “cash” in the text.

What determines what's profitable to mine? Is it just the price? FOr instance if BTC was trading higher than BCH then would that make it more profitable by default?

@_date: 2017-11-15 22:22:38
Thats absurd. 
Thats like saying any company should be able to infringe on a trademark or logo or brandname and its totally fine and fair because its healthy competition. 
Being a competitor doesnt give you a right to steal the name of your competitor or deceive your customers as to what theyre buying into. Thats not “fair fighting” in any other industry this would be illegal. 
If that Chinese altcoin was concerned about fighting fair they would call their coin something totally different unrelated to Bitcoin and try to compete on the functions of the currency alone. 
But is that whats happening ? Nope. Deception, slander, disinformation are the tactics. And you say CORE isnt fighting fair because theyre not bending over and taking it? Lmao. Just fkn lmao. 
This logic is so potato its not even funny.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:22:04
Wrong. Your logic is flawed. If i make a copy of a picasso painting that doesnt mean there are now 2 picassos. One is the real one - and the other is a copy. This isnt opinion, its fact. 
Even if you really did believe in BCH, it still wouldnt change the fact that isnt an altcoin that was forked off of the real Bitcoin.

Youre essentially being granted access to the private keys of a specific amount of bitcoin. Thats really all it is in the end. Whether the key is in a wallet, on an exchange, in your head - doesnt matter.

You need whats called a secured credit card. You put x amount in an account and you get a credit card for roughly less than that amount.

You can use Shapeshift or Changelly to swap any coin for anything else if you have to. The biggest issue is making sure youre registered and verified with a good exchange that you can use to cash out when you want or have to. 
Dont worry too much about what the exchange trades or sells. Kraken deals in more coins than Quadriga and services canadians but its a nightmare to use compared to Quadriga. So if anything just buy Bitcoin on quadriga and then use Shapeshift to swap it for another altcoin you want if thats what youre after.

No im just saying if there are alts you want that your exchange doesnt sell - you can just swap some Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever you have for whatever alt you want. 
Theres no single right way to do it. Its whatever works best for you. But when you want to cash out on Quadriga if youre holding some obscure altcoin youll have to swap it for a coin that you can sell for fiat on Quadriga. 
For instance if I want to sell ripple - i cant sell it on quadriga. Id have to swap it for a coin that quadriga handles and then move that coin to the exchange and sell it. 
Thats why its good to have your exchange registration / verification set up ahead of time.

No - because bank wires can take a few days. This is a bank problem - not a bitcoin problem. If i wanted to wire you money now you would have to wait the same amount of time. 
But the process of putting in a sell order on an exchange and selling coins is near instant. Then you have actual money in your account - and you wire it to your bank. 
Not complicated at all.

There is no real significance other than the fact that you own more bitcoin. And when you have one (or more) coins its more exciting to watch the price fluctuate because you see the gains and losses in full.

@_date: 2017-09-13 14:19:35
it's still Irrelevant.
You cannot gauge stocks under the assumption that everybody owns the same amount. It's about "what percentage of my investment did I lose or gain?"
That's all that matters. If I held $50,000 worth of BTC and take a 70% hit in 2014 - compared to you who maybe has 1 BTC in 2017 and take a 50% hit - you're saying YOUR losses sting more than mine?
Think about that and you'll see why only the percentage is important.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:39:16
....you're still not getting it man. 
I don't know how I can explain it any more clearly. 
Yes the same amount of dollars invested at different times is going to result in different dollar gains/losses - but THIS IS IRRELEVANT from an investment standpoint simply because not everybody is investing the same amount. 
If you and I both invest our life savings in BTC - at different times - I lose 70% of my life savings and you lose 50% - you may technically loose more dollars but my losses are more significant because a bigger piece of the only pie I have has just been wiped out. 
You're assuming $1 to everybody is the same $1. There are people who can burn $10k like it's nothing and to others $1000 is a huge investment. For the poor guy who put in $1000 and just lost 70% of it it's much worse. 
tl:dr; there are way too many variables to view this from a dollar standpoint. It has to be looked at from percentages and percentages only. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:24:17

It might sting, but 6 btc isnt worth killing yourself over. Dont even entertain that thought for a second. There are people in this world who have lost millions and kept going to enjoy their lives. 
6 btc is a miniscule amount compared to the pain, suffering and eternity of death. Death is permanent. Bitcoin is 1s and 0s. 
Imagine a loved one were about to die and you were given the chance to save their life for 6 btc. Would you pay it? Of course you would. Youd probably pay 60btc or 600btc. Because life is all that matters in the end. 
As bad as this hurts now youll look back at it one day as a good story to tell. Just breathe and talk to people who love you for support.

Thanks I'm trying to grasp it but this aspect is still a bit confusing for me. 
Thanks for explaining though. So if I'm not mistaken the lack of replay protection means a confirmed transaction could be nullified and coins lost forever? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:18:44
Pretty sure it's because more sources are starting to confirm that China is shutting down BTC exchanges.

Being scared probably means you've got more invested than you can safely lose. I put in what I know I could burn tomorrow and still keep living with no hiccup in my life whatsoever. That's the way to do it. 
I think in general if you're honestly SCARED of the BTC you hold dropping to $0 then you've got way too much skin in the game. 
Not you specifically but just in general. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 08:15:11
To be honest you SHOULD go into detail. As much as possible to help others avoid the same trap you fell into. I'm sorry this happened to you - but you kind of have an unwritten obligation to warn others.

Somebody did it a while back and took out a line of credit against their house to buy (in June I think) and they banked like $300,000 from it in the end. 
Sounds great right? Yeah no. Still stupid. One instance of it working out doesn't justify something so risky. 
As for your case - a couple of grand isn't a catastrophic amount of debt (assuming your shit is in order) but even so I would say you should generally avoid taking out a debt to gamble with. Even if at the moment it seems like a sure thing. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:10:23

Will there be an easy way to split? I know with the BCH thing the wallet developers had to provide specific instructions on how to split for that specific wallet etc. Will something like this take place again? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:47:51
I have no idea, but I don't even think every wallet out there allows for coins to be sent to multiple addresses within a single transaction.
This 'solution' is a mess. I think you'll see the more reputable wallets pushing updates that simplify this process. I don't think any of them are going to just throw up their hands and say "oh well the hell with it" the backlash of users losing funds and lost in confusion will be way too immense to just ignore.

I really dont care if its mass adopted or not. I actually dont believe it will ever replace fiat. The barriers to useability/security for the average person are WAYYYY too complex for it to ever even be close to replacing fiat in its current form. (Hardware wallet? Software wallet? Paper wallet? Hard fork? Segwit? 2x? Private key? Replay protection? lol. Go try explaining all that to a baby boomer and then tell them its better than their bank)

Um - that's not how a family works. Who's to say He paid for the house solely by himself?! There's so many things wrong with what you just said and I'm too tired to list them all but leaving your family with no home after you pass away because of a gamble you made isn't something a Husband/father is "entitled to"
I can't imagine any respectable man who wouldn't want his family to have everything and be as well taken care of as possible. 
Now if he had NO wife and NO kids that's a different story he can do as he pleases. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:10:08
From a percentage standpoint, yes it is.
You're speaking under the assumption that everybody has the same amount of BTC holdings which would mean the dollar/loss is more significant. But I may have held more coins @ $1000 than you do  - so my losses back then were potentially MUCH more significant from a dollar standpoint regardless that the prices were way lower. 
Thats why these things have to be looked at from a percentage standpoint - in 2014 nobody ever thought it would hit what it did this year - so it's irrelevant - my point was that seeing over 70% of BTCs value evaporate was far far scarier than this. This is nothing. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:47:23

Cute attempt at being dramatic but the fact is life is better with wealth. All those 'things' you dream of doing, places you dream of seeing - it all takes money. Want a family? Want them to live in a shack? Or in comfort? (not YOU - but the figurative YOU)
Point is I cringe when people try to make wealth into an ugly thing. As if people with money are somehow out of touch and not REALLY enjoying life the way they would be if they were broke and in debt. 
This is utter silliness and an absolute cope. 
Yeah when we die we don't take it with us - sure. But when we're dead we also aren't going to give a shit. We aren't alive to feel the pain of losing it all. So it doesn't matter. And on the upside you can leave it all to your family and ensure your children have an edge.

Type in "BTC to USD" in Google and you have a quick currency converter. That's one way to know. 
The longer answer means that '$200 worth of BTC' says he doesn't posess any 'whole' coins but a certain fraction of a coin. Basically right now about 0.05 BTC.
When/if he chooses he can sell the coin for fiat currency through an online exchange, and then transfer the money to his bank account. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:48:47

I'm sorry you bothered to type all that but I'm not concerned with your opinion of me. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:39:25
No different than any other technology in the world. 
Ask the average person about the technical details of how the internet works. Or how cellphones work. Or how computers work. 
It will always only be a small niche group that concerns themselves with the intricacies of things. The majority just want it to work and to benefit them. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:11:31
Yes. And?
You saying that because something isn't admirable that it means it can't be commonplace?
Float back down to Earth please. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:18:34


lmao says who? You? Just like it never went back up after crashing over 70% in 2014?
Plz sell it all and find a new hobby with those silly putty hands of yours. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:06:19
Thanks for the help. However these solutions are above my pay grade so to speak and i really dont trust myself or even fully understand either of the options. Im hoping something easier and more straightforward comes along. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:36:15
Sure I understand that. I just figured most people (at least the ones involved/concerned with BTC) had coins in their possession purchased a long time ago. Maybe it's less than I thought. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:32:25


Aside from not being able to 'claim' coin from a forked blockchain the way we could with BCH - why is this dangerous?
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:13:38
Bingo. Exactly my point. Even though mathematically it's the same -
 from a psychological standpoint it's extremely important. 
And it's not because people are stupid. It's just human nature. "zero point one" sounds incomplete and insignificant. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:39:57
Yeah man you're just like... so smart and convincing. It's difficult to keep up. S-sorry sir. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:53:51
I disagree.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:50:25
I think so. I think from the persons profile. Lol and thanks. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:01:55
What if? All signs point to that being exactly what it is. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:15:12
Oh nice. Sounds like some entertaining comment sections. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:29:36
$200 dip isn't even worth blinking over let alone making a thread about. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:01:47
I don't see the confusion. 
r/btc says s2x will cripple and nullify core. 
r/bitcoin says s2x will die out like bcash did
you're just misreading what I typed. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:12:25
Because uncertainty, confusion and fear have already taken root. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:03:26
Theoretically: if everybody accepted it as payment then you wouldn't need to exchange it for anything ever. 
And no - buying and selling them is not centralized at all. The most convenient online ways are subject to govt interference sure - but that doesn't mean it's centralized or even really necessary in the long run. 
Look at the bigger picture here. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:31:17
"high saturation of retards"
I see. Your opinion sounds quite professional. 
Slow down a little though I can't keep up with these technical terms. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:00:45
Sure I will. 50% is still less than the 70+% BTC lost in 2014 - so yes I'll still be laughing. These dips only make me money. Why wouldn't I laugh?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:38:06
Also it sounds like an opinion of a man that's far removed from the intricacies of his his wealth or any understanding of it. 
Mr. Billionaire says Bitcoin is bad! No supervision from bank! Its bad!
Like when is the last time this guy actually gave a moment of critical thought to the banking system? Easy to say these things when you're worth billions and are literally immune to the pitfalls of legacy banking. 
The only bubble I see here is the one closing this guy off from the real world. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:46:39
Anybody who doesnt understand a simple concept like BTC being divisible up to 8 decimal places (and forked to support more if necessary) has no business writing articles about it. 
Somebody take this guys computer away. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:44:11
Maybe because those bags have ballooned in value over a short few years making many people a lot of money? Not sure why youre so confused. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:52:26
Oh I understood your point the first time around. It's just wrong.
A capitalist society runs on greed and pride.
The foundation of our society is not "sharing success".
Your view of the world seems akin to that of a sheltered millennial who's never really experienced life outside a University lecture hall.  
Maybe that's you. Maybe it isn't. I don't really care. But for your own good you should come to grips with the reality of human nature before it blindsides you. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:36:29
Well this got dark.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:08:29
I bought in during 2014. Back then i kicked myself for not getting in 3 years earlier. Just as people in 2020 will kick themselves for not getting in during 2017. Dont worry at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:39:08
There are several ways to manually split the coins. Its a bit messy and im in no way an expert but its very possible. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:34:08
If the long haul looks to be this bleak then what are you in it for specifically?
Not trying to argue - generally asking. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:57:51
I'd opt for that personally. 
And honestly with the way this thing swings up and down it's so easy just to wait for some tasty dips (like the one we saw today) and pick up what you can afford during the dips. Before you know it you'll have accumulated a nice little portfolio without one dollar of debt.
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:29:23
How do you do a transfer on "each chain?" 
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:24:44
It definitely wont. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:19:00
Well I guess that's it boys. Sell it all.
RBC man and thatguy1888111 say it's a bubble.
Must be a bubble.
Dump it all. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:13:02
How does it work for coins stored in wallets? Will users have to wait for the wallet developers to release updates that make splitting the coins possible?
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:30:08
It's amazing not only how knowledgeable he is but how he's always able to deliver his knowledge in such a concise and easy to understand way. This is usually a sign of somebody who really truly understands what he's talking about and doesn't just regurgitate things he's heard. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:21:45
I've tried making several threads asking questions about some valid points make in other subs and they kept being wiped off the map. It's making me trust this sub less and less. Why censor posts ?

Well I'm happy for you. Perhaps we can all be elevated to Saint status someday too, Father.

What's the angle of that place?

You couldn't write scripts this good. :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:05:33
....momentarily dips so you can buy more and then goes up higher in the long run.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:48:26
This is an important point. Exchange $6000 of something for 1 of something else. OR $100 of something for 0.01 of something else. It seems counter-intuitive. 
This of course is all a matter of nomenclature. If we said $6000 buys you 100,000,000 Satoshis it would'nt seem so odd.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:34:59
It's way harder than it should be. It's nowhere near simple enough to avoid people losing money. Wallet devs are going to have to update their software to automate this process. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:45:52
Except the landing isn't as soft.

China ban barely made a dent I really couldnt care less what they do up there in Russia. If Bitcoin was gonna sink, China was the torpedo to do it. Lol @ caring what Russia does.

That's what people said at $500.
Then again at $1000.
Then again at $2000. 
See the trend?

ayyyyyy my man
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:13:16
One thing I question when he says it cant be stopped; sure, bitcoin itself cant be stopped - but prohibiting exchanges from operating is something that could be done. This is a weak point in the "it cant be stopped" argument.

Quickbt.com is amazing. You have a limit but after a few purchases they up your limit. But sorry, there are fees there too. But its very quick easy and reliable. Orders are near instant. No waiting for processing etc. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:48:09


I didn't mean that in the context you took it. I meant that discrediting things just because one day you're going to die is a childish viewpoint often used as a coping mechanism.
However aside from that your post was an interesting read. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:28:45
So I guess you fall in the camp that thinks core will be 'fired' so to speak? Not hating just curious. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:44:23
Cute cliche' - but it's not my level as I haven't insulted you once. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:07:39
It's ok. I'm more concerned with why my threads are being censored from this subreddit. 
It seems like any thread I make concerning this topic is wiped off the "new" section. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:11:01
If you can’t be bothered to learn the basics, and call people cunts when they tell you to do further reading - dont expect much in the way of assistance in understanding. Educating you isn’t my job or concern. I’ve made my money. Your ignorance is irrelevant. 
Keep calling it a pyramid scheme and calling me a cunt if that suits you. Bye. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:02:09
Cool story T-1000. However since most of us are human - the feeling of delight when doing better than somebody who's wronged you in your life - while maybe less than admirable and a bit petty - is actually a pretty normal thing to experience.
This post was just a playful poke at that. No need to logic stomp it.

You're making the mistake of thinking panic sells are logically thought out and not emotionally driven. 
To some - "ICO ban" says "Bitcoin Ban!" in their heads.

Insult after insult. 
The irony of this is gold. :)
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:57:05
Thanks for that reply I appreciate it. 
It's interesting I've been around/involved with bitcoin since 2014 and I've never considered that the fact that it gained any traction at all was the real hurdle to get over. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:06:09
Well when a man and a woman love each other....
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:57:07
Same I'm just going to lock down and kinda wait it out. I just hope there's a clear way to separate the coins regardless. I hate not knowing wtf is going to happen - what wallets will make it easy, if my exchanges that i use will support this etc etc. It's irritating. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:19:25
Not even remotely. I just like to look at the world for what it is.
Fooling yourself into thinking otherwise is what's childlike.

L M A O 
Good luck.


If the average blue collar worker had a clue about how 'money' and banks actually worked they would be equally as angry and bewildered. The system as it is relies on people being ignorant. Also, the scenarios you've listed are not indicative of a problem with BTC - but rather the typical pangs that come with the early stages of adoption.
It's like saying "imagine convincing people that they would talk to each other on computers and didn't need to send physical letters anymore" - the problem is the adoption/ignorance - not the technology. 
I'm not saying BTC will ever replace fiat currency - but if you wanna discuss a system with failure built in - examine paper money first.
