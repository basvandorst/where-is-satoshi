Adoption in the sporting world will be valuable.  I just bought the 6th man offer, 2 tickets, 2 shirts, 1 parking pass for .21665btc ($98).  This is cheap.  Whether you like basketball or not, realize sales results from this publicity stunt will have an impact on many other organziations across major league sports.

Well, at least it's progress... Anything other than "bitcoin is the end of the world" or "its a scam" from fox news might be a positive.

Don't look at it as getting behind the Kings.  Instead, see that it is getting behind the first mover/organization in the sporting world to take this step.  A lot of other teams are looking in to this now and will be impacted by the result of this. IMO, this is a much bigger deal than it seems.

If you started taking your salary or a portion of your salary in bitcoin, media coverage would be all over it. I would think that would be a good way to scale your efforts and the easiest way to bring awareness to a lot of people.  Also, if you got your organization and teammates to start accepting, more awareness would result. I think bitpay has a payroll service, and I've heard of a couple others. Great to see a fellow basketball lover in this sub. Good luck!

Right on. Perhaps whatever portion of your income you already plan to invest in btc have paid in btc. Even that small percentage might catch attention. I'd also point your organization to what the Sacramento Kings are doing. Kingsbitcoin.com

I didn't mean to indicate that it did, rather, was illustrating that $98 is not much money for (borderline) entertainment and furthering awareness to a market that could have a huge impact on mass adoption.
Edit: I'm a life long Kings fan and fully aware of how terrible they are.

Further adoption by professional sports teams will bring awareness to the athletes.  Once some of these glorified athletes take a liking to it, they will become glorified promoters.  This is a route to critical mass.  I can see it now: "x-athlete now taking salary in bitcoin" - imagine what that will do for the general public.

Do you know what the formula is for getting todays price?  Can't figure it out from the support page, and the comments below don't seem to work for me either.

How did you get it to display the price today? ""GOOGLEFINANCE("BTCUSD")" doesn't work for me, can't figure it out from the support page either.

I'm an idiot. Had put the = on prior tries but didn't include the "".  Thanks for the help.
