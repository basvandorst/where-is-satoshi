How do we get rid of these toxic players, gavin and hearn?
I don't care about what the right or wrong solution is regarding blocksize. This whole fight could have been over to change bitcoin's logo for all I care.  The way Gavin and Hearn have conducted themselves tells the whole story. They have done nothing but put a gun to the head of bitcoin, it's 3.5 billion dollar economy, millions more in VC, and whole of the community to get their way in a screaming temper tantrum. They are forever irresponsible and childish in my view for this and THEY need to be removed from the project AND the community, right now.
The adults can continue talking about how to improve things. I don't care how smart they are or how many lines of code they've written. We don't need them on the project to move on. We can solve this problem and any new ones by rational testing and logical procedure, the way we've been solving them since we started.
It's not 2011 anymore. The time when you can just update code randomly, screw up, **halt trading**.. those days are gone. Call it alpha if you want but bitcoin is prime time, like it or not, and the rules we have set up to do this properly need to be respected.
We've all been forced into a [blackmail paradox]( by Mike Hearn and Gavin Andressen. The answer to the blocksize problem can't be dealt with rationally or fairly with these two actors still at the table.

Has anyone here even read this?
An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
* Reverse transactions **that he sends** while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
* Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
**The attacker can't:**
* Reverse other people's transactions
* Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
* Change the number of coins generated per block
* Create coins out of thin air
* Send coins that never belonged to him

No. Not trustless because decentralized. Trustless because of the laws of mathematics.
Decentralization gives you redundancy. If there was one bitcoin server, it could be shut down by government and seized. Having both nodes and hash power spread out makes bitcoin unstoppable- but it does not make it trustless. 
You can trust your coins being given to you are valid because you can follow them to their inception on your copy of the blockchain. You can be sure the person sending you the coins is the true owner because of public key cryptography, the same technology that has been making passwords a valid form of identification since there has been an internet. That is why it is trustless.
No matter what hashing power you have, you can't FAKE a block, the  wallet can tell. The world could collapse and 100% of all the world's hashing power could be a single BFL unit, and you could still be sure your coins were valid. That would be a VERY LONG WAIT for the difficulty to fall, and the network would be slow as hell, but the coins will be true-- until someone cracks SHA256.
Kudos for calling me on my fallacy- My jimmies are rustled over the lack of research this community has done. People come here FIRST when they hear about bitcoins and all they see is fucking fearmongering.

You might be able to double spend a single block with %51. If you are are really, really lucky, and wait a long time for the opportunity.
To really cause an intentional fork (that is all the attack is after all, and orphaned blocks happen every day, it is not a big deal) with any kind of reliability you'd need like 80%. 
People fear what they do not understand. Reading is hard.

You get paid the same as most pools (PPLNS? haven't looked in ages) when it comes to "how much". It's just how the pool goes about crediting you your share is what's unique, most pools send from their address to yours. At Eligius you're included in the block found as part of the first transaction in the block, which is that (currently) 25BTC reward per block. These show up in wallets as being from "Generated" instead of an address.

There were several "conceived" bitcoin-like inventions that never came to pass that have been uncovered. I think this is because BTC is not a new technology but rather many existing  put together in a new way.
The NSA invented the SHA2 series of hashing that we all use, if you'd like to get the tinfoil out
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:21:42
Eligius also pays in Generated bitcoins credited to your address (Fresh, not sent to you, but newly minted). 
I think this is kind of cool, though not technically significant. Also you should know that this is the kind of payment that many exchanges/services have trouble reading, which is the reason for warnings like "do not mine to deposit address" on cryptsy and other pages.
I have my SHA256 miners pointed at eligius.

It's not in there because that's not possible via the attacker. You have 100% nailed my motivation for posting at all.
Ghash has no ability to manipulate the market. No amount of hashing power does. But what absolutely moves the market is the knee-jerk reactions of this subreddit and other media outlets. Everyone is **FREAKING OUT** over something that *really isn't that bad*. Consider that if not for 10 daily posts about Ghash, 51% attacks, and "WHAT WE NEED TO DO, NOW", the price would not have moved at all. Contrast this to Gox, where LOTS of people lost REAL, LARGE SUMS of money.
The people causing the market to react poorly are **ALL OF YOU CALLING FOR ACTION**. "51% attack" is going to join the everyday vocabulary of the layperson, who thinks the CEO of bitcoin is dead and that bitcoin went bankrupt. And I'm pretty sure more than one person in this subreddit knows exactly that that's what they're doing, and it's got my jimmies in maximum over-rustle.
A REAL 51% attack has very little teeth, but we are sharpening it's teeth every day in this subreddit. Please stop.
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:43:14
The burden of proof lies on the accuser, sir. This is not a McCarthy trial and you are not Glenn Beck. You don't get to make accusations and then force people to try and prove you wrong.  I don't have to prove ghash can't manipulate the market, you have to prove they CAN.
I accuse you of being a turtle. Prove me wrong. Is this how it works?
It's also not "A" bitcoin wiki, it's "THE" bitcoin wiki, as in, the official manual to this software we use. If we're so quick to dissmiss official documentation, why don't you put vegetable oil in your car instead of 10-W30? It's cheaper. Fuck the manual!
Peter Todd is following his trading plan and that's fine for him. That post doesn't really concern itself with WHY the 51% attack is bad, only assumes that it is (like all posts in this subreddit on the topic) and then proceeds to talk about "what we must do". I asked him to explain himself and didn't get a response.
Edit: I should clarify I don't feel the markets are currently reacting to anything. My personal opinion is the price is correcting because there was just a big jump this month. I am concerned the inflating of this 51% boogeyman will cause damage in the future. Ghash/Cex have already double-spent using a "51% attack" vs satoshidice (only 0-conf services need worry about this at all anyway) and not only didn't the market crash, but nobody went out of business. This is because the damage possible is QUITE limited. Nobody who accepts 0-conf transactions is unaware of this risk (because double spends can happen without hashrate via sybil attack), and I am more than sure anyone with previous payment processing industry experience has priced it in to their service.
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:32:09
Could potentially isolate networks from each other too, the sybil attack is listed a tier higher on the threat scale. But overall not enough to "Kill Bitcoin" either IMO, so.. yeah not all that terrible. Probably not even as bad as Gox.

@_date: 2014-06-16 00:06:42
Except that the moment they lose the hashpower, through deliberate miner action or luck of variance, everything continues as normal. What you wind up with is a blockchain that stutters. Strings of "Ghash" blockchain mixed in with strings of legit blockchain. Things slow down, but it's hardly worth 6 frontpage posts a day over. This issue is an anthill to the Mt. Goxxing. People like to be scared of shit.
Edit:  obligatory mention  &lt;- This is the manual, folks.

frud did a good job, I'll only add that the miner is free to include any (or none, empty blocks are valid as long as they have the mining reward) transactions they desire. It's assumed that miners seeking the most profit will prioritize the transactions that include the most fees first, since the miner also keeps all fees. At today's difficulties/hashrates the nonce/extranonce does indeed overflow constantly, at which point you would need some kind of data swap (transactions can be swapped but typically the timestamp is enough). When and how this happens is up to the mining software/stratum server, though i'm sure everyone has it fairly optimized by now.

The problem is not that we don't need to trust GHash. The problem is people think they are having to trust GHash, when there is no trust required. The problem is people don't understand what they are all afraid of. 
IT IS a trustless system. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:19:51
The miners do their own hashing. The pools give miners low-difficulty dummy blocks to work on and randomly the dummy block gives the correct hash to the true current block. The dummy solutions (shares) provide a way to measure effort and divvy up the reward.
But what you are describing is a "hidden block" attack. 
AFAIK the only thing stopping it is the mining software you use. This is an issue on p2pool on a small scale but could actually happen on any pool- the problem isn't rampant yet but as a miner I'm fairly concerned.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:40:34
Not exactly. This is how it works- The attacker finds a block and HIDES IT while the rest of the network goes along mining. The attacker then has to get LUCKY ENOUGH to get SEVERAL MORE BLOCKS to hide, all branching from his first hidden block, fast enough to PASS the legit blockchain. It then announces this to the network, causing a several-block-long orphaned branch. Those transactions that were orphaned will need to be reconfirmed (NOT RE-SENT) and the original block reward finders lose their reward.
This process can be repeated but with only 51% they will have a difficult time getting the luck required to keep ahead of the legit blockchain. The moment they broadcast their "bad branch" and orphan the legit blockchain, the legit miners instantly begin working from that branch and the attacker MUST START OVER. Each block he wants to extend this bad branch becomes exponentially harder to do.
Orphaned blocks happen all the time. Sometimes even multiple blocks long. Being able to extend this to 4 or maybe 5 blocks (with LUCK, not AT WILL) via an attack is not the end of the world and it is VERY POSSIBLE NOBODY WOULD NOTICE IT EVEN HAPPENED (except that someone will be right here to to make a huge fuss and crash the price)
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:30:17


You aren't trusting them. Nobody is. Bitcoin is trustless- that includes trusting miners.
But for some reason everyone seems to think they have to trust them. With what are we trusting them exactly?
Do you know what a miner is actually doing with all that computing power? What his job is in this whole crypto thing?
I've been a bitcoin miner since 2011. I am not worried in the slightest. The  bitcoin devs are not worried. Andreas is not worried. Are we all just idiots? Possible. Or, we might know something 20,000 redditors fresh in from the december bubble don't-   But nobody seems to care to listen
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:54:44
That's not what it says. Those are specifically listed in what they CAN'T do.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:18:59
I can get 100% of a block reward by finding blocks solo mining. The 51% attacker will not get any more BTC than their hashpower allows. The NODES (wallets) verify blocks. Having 51% hashpower doesn't allow you to publish invalid blocks. Also they can only PAUSE transactions from getting CONFIRMED. ALL transactions will still show as unconfirmed by the network, since this information is also relayed by NODES.
Miners mitigate blockchain spam. That's pretty much it. Your copy of the wallet software independently verifies every transaction. I can publish invalid blocks to the network ALL DAY, with 0% of the hashrate. The wallets will collectively reject every last one.
**THIS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AS IT IS THE BASIS FOR THIS WHOLE DIGITAL CURRENCY THING, ALL COINS**
DIGITAL CURRENCY IS TRUSTLESS. That means not having to trust the miners, too. Their powers are limited to advancing the blockchain, and choosing transactions to confirm. They keep things moving along. A naughty miner can do little more than slow things down. Your wallet can tell invalid transactions from valid ones using it's copy of the blockchain. You do not need a miner to tell you good from bad, or to keep you safe. A miner cannot make your wallet accept fake coins no matter how much hashpower he has, even if it was 99%.

@_date: 2014-06-17 19:51:00
There's a part of the block header called a 'nonce'. This is a junk number that the miner rolls around as fast as it can to produce hashes. It's the end result hash that must be lower than the target.
There's no way to predict what the hash of a piece of data will be prior to hashing it. There's also no relation in the hashes of similar data. Thusly the only way to find a below-target hash is to try as many as you can, as fast as you can. Increment nonce, hash block. Increment nonce, hash block. Increment nonce, hash block. That's the miner's chore.
(every miner also is working on block with different contents so it's not automatically a game of 'the fastest miner wins')
Edit: -example-
SHA256 Hash of "some data1": 77112faca9b150a5c794d2aa785a973af7e2c0cef396b682008d98d9b91787ed
SHA256 Hash of "some data2": ed0872debeef828c9fcf9296e77dd223dab785191d64174f7eb0caf4b2ecdcc8
as you can see though the entry data is very close, there's nothing close about the hashes.
Edit2: -fun game!-
Try to SHA256 at  and see if I included the quotes or not when I did those hashes. This is how computers check to make sure you've entered the right password- by matching hashes of input data
@_date: 2014-06-15 00:21:30
We're the biggest community with the most hashpower, so who is going to blast us exactly? Ghash?
Feathercoin got hit with a 93% attack (800% increase) and the attacker got 80 consecutive blocks worth of holding. That coin has a 1 minute block time, so that's almost 90 minutes of attacking. ***with 93% of the hashpower***
Nobody had any coins stolen. 
Their "ALL" timespan price chart on cryptsy looks exactly like any other altcoin. No mention of it anywhere in their subreddit now- and that is a community of hundreds- not tens of thousands.
Please explain why you think that an actual 51% attack would be worse than getting goxxed, because that is just about the worst disaster this coin has had and we're doing FINE.
@_date: 2014-06-15 00:13:31
I do get you, and you are right mathematically, but it would never work that way in real life- because the time you would need to outrace the 49% varies. On an infinite timeframe, the 51% will always win, just like "you get paid the same for your hashrate at any pool over a long enough timeframe", This is also true- but there are very much periods of feast vs famine on a smaller pool. He can hold to publish longer during a famine period, but like I said, the longer he waits the bigger the risk of leaving with nothing. 
And there's really not a lot you can get away with either. Everyone's discussing how many locks to put on a gun safe when all that's inside is a water pistol.
The other issue is measuring the hashrate. The true hashrate of GHash is unknowable, even to them. Their self reporting is also subject to variance. No pool knows the hashrate of it's mining fleet, only the shares submitted by a worker. The pie chart (and they themselves) could report 70% of the hashrate, and actually only have 40%- but just have gotten REALLY lucky today.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:56:09
Hi there, if the wallet softwares/nodes all upgrade, will the "unaccepted revisionist" miners not simply have their blocks rejected? Isn't this the actual method by which bitcoin is considered "distributed"?
If someone with 80% hash power didn't want to accept a hard fork that would put him at disadvantage, isn't this totally out of his power to do anything about?
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:58:47
No actually, it's the nodes who decide on the protocol. It's the nodes that control the network, it's the nodes that verify transactions. This is the magic of bitcoin. YOUR COPY OF THE WALLET is verifying transactions are legit. You don't need to rely or trust any outside source, not even the miners. It's not committing transactions to the blockchain, but it decides if what the miners are doing is legit or not. Just because it's in the blockchain doesn't make the transaction valid. Miners simply advance the blockchain and protect it from "junk or spam" blocks by making the power required to do so very high. Miners are free to find and publish completely empty blocks if they wish, they will not be rejected. Its your wallet software that reads the blockchain, and is able to see if address 1ABC actually had the coins to deliver to 1XYZ.
Edit: If anyone should be freaking out about controlling %51 of something, it needs to be the nodes. Mining is overglorified. A %51 attack would be fairly large scale inconvenience, some people might get scammed, but it will hardly be the end of things. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:52:39
The transactions are hashed together, then that single hash along with the header gets hashed and the nonce rolled until a block hash is found. The individual transactions are included in this way but not directly.
Edit: clarity
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:26:17


Because of variance right? Variance quickly turns a "guaranteed at will orphaning" (you seemed to also imply like it could be done for as many blocks as desired) into "able to orphan a few blocks if they get lucky". The most I've seen any pool able to get in a row regularly is about 6. The entirety of the rest of the mining power is working together. They can keep mining hidden blocks until they get lucky enough to pull ahead, but the longer that takes the less likely they are to maintain that hashpower. If they can't maintain it in time to publish, they've wasted all their efforts.
And when they publish, they start again at 0 hidden blocks.
Now, they could keep doing it, orphaning 2-3 block chains at a time, maybe almost every day-- but this already happens naturally and we all chug along.
The most damage BY FAR will come from the "dreaded announcement" that a 51% attack has occured. This is no different than "CEO of bitcoin commits suicide", or "Bitcoin Bankrupt!!". Maybe someone loses a few coins, but this will not be anywhere near the magnitude of gox- and we already survived that. I can't even find the gox drop on the 1 day chart anymore- it looks like a normal wave. That's what we're really all afraid of right? The price dropping.
It will, if we keep going about this foolishness.
It will bounce back too. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:54:43
The transactions will be included in new blocks still. The system is designed to deal with orphaned blocks, and a 51% attack is no more than a deliberate orphaning. Your transactions will go from "6 confirmations" to 0/unconfirmed. The problem with an unconfirmed transaction is that we do not make the assumption our network node has heard 100% of the data. The attacker send you some coins, and also send someone ELSE some coins.   This can actually be done by anyone with enough know-how (no mining needed), so we rely on the miners to pick and tell us which of those transactions went first. If the attacker decides "not you" (or even sends the coins back to himself) in his published blockchain, you will never get the coins. Other transactions will be included in later blocks.
What should be added is that not just the attacker, but anyone with advance knowledge that this was going to happen could potentially double-spend- but I would consider anyone knowing in advance is probably part of the attack.
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:03:56
You forgot to add: [Citation Needed]
How long have you been mining?
Feathercoin had a 93% attack and they managed to get 80 consecutive blocks (1 minute block target, so they did not manage to pull it off longer than an hour and a half.)
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:32:17


Really not close to that amount of blocks. Like half a dozen maybe.
The transactions become unconfirmed and need to be reconfirmed, yes.
However the signed transactions have already been broadcasted. The nodes will show them as 0/unconfirmed and the rest of the miners will continue to work on them. Things just slow down.
