Why can't it grow its market share of selling ASICMiners? More ASICminers in hands of other miners --&gt; Greater network security --&gt;  Greater bitcoin credibility IMHO
If you are referring to its share of the network hash rate, I agree that it will likely not expand much further.  But that is fine, even just maintaining its current percentage would be great.

I hear you and agree with the main point.  But I think you should realize that some of us are such ardent supporters not due to the financial incentive, but because bitcoin cured our apathy.  
The fight against the wealthy elite that runs the countries, big banks, huge government, etc. seemed so futile to many of us--but Bitcoin seems like a real, pragmatic tool to help fight them and give some power back to the people.

I am American so this is US-centric:
Bitcoin Poker - Seas with Clubs is the best site, feel free to PM me for more info / referral bonuses
BitInstant (CVS, Walgreens, 7/11, etc.) - bitinstant.com
Dwolla / wire transfer --&gt; CampBX if you want an exchange (takes some time)
Coinbase (takes some time)
Wire to Mt. Gox (personally I dislike Mt. Gox and want to see them lose market share, but it is an option)
localbitcoins.com or BitcoinOTC
Open air exchange in NYC if you live in NY metro area
Bitcoin ATM’s will be coming soon
Some Ex-US options:
Bitstamp.net 
and many others

One key factor:  China's first quarter growth numbers were lower than expected and they are some of the biggest buyers of gold.  As a result, due to lower, anticipated future demand, the price of gold is dropping.

Yes, because obviously the only company that has been able to produce ASIC miners en masse in a timely manner will not be able to create and produce better, more efficient miners.  Meanwhile the companies that have consistently overpromised and under delivered are sure to start shipping in quantity at any moment now…
Obviously other competitors will eventually take market share, but ASICMiner will also continue to develop and produce better miners.  It has a pole position, experience producing chips, experience running the farm, and a strong track record of actually delivering on its promises.
@_date: 2013-07-30 18:28:09
Haha yes exactly.  It is so funny to me that everyone on the forums use ROI incorrectly, but it is so widespread at this pt and not a big deal.  In most cases I believe the most appropriate term would be "payback period," as generally they are referring to a length of time.  Breakeven point also works.
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:57:38
Yes, each transaction has a fee.  Currently you can set it quite low, even at zero, and it will be included by a miner.  But a miner will first include all the highest fee tranasctions first.  As time goes on, a higher fee will be required to get your transaction accepted.

I would love to claim credit for this story because I love it and frequently use it --but it is from bitcointalk forums:
Satoshi is a time-traveler who came from a dystopian future where centrally-managed currencies have caused economic havok and chaos. Strapping himself in his machine, he pushed a button and popped up on the outskirts of a major city. Making his way to the nearest hackspace, he began his coding odyssey.
When the whitepaper was complete, along with the code for the first client running along on his personal network, he sent the results out into the greater internet for it to germinate into the vibrant movement that it is today.
Looking down at his monitor, he only had a few seconds to consider what he had accomplished, before his upstream timeline was wiped out by the tsunami of change that bitcoin will be.
A well worn coin dropped to the floor from thin air, rolling to rest in the cracks of the dingy linoleum. The world had been saved, but would never know the man that started it all.

All those people have heavily invested their time and other resources into bitcoin.  What incentive would they have to make decisions that hurt it?  
I would like them to have less power, I do agree.  But bitcoin is still very young and still needs to work out kinks.  As it ages, it will become more decentralized.
Also any changes they suggest, have to be accepted by the majority of miners to actually affect bitcoin.  Obviously miners saw the utility in solving the fork in the suggest manner, so they accepted the solution quickly.  
I am fine with a wealthy class if they are not acting in a manner that systematically represses and steals from the middle / lower class.  Also all those guys can spend their bitcoins once--they have not created a system that works to help them and their friends while treading on the rights of others.
Also I am not saying that Europe / US / China is there now, its just frightening the way things are moving.

So true.  Bitcoin has bubbled before and crashed, and it always has come back.  I am not saying it is certain--but this is certainly not unprecedented.  Last crash was actually worse in percentage terms, its just nominal terms that have people worried.

@_date: 2013-04-21 00:21:40
True, but if you have a significant amount of bitcoins, you should be storing them in cold storage and/or using a web wallet with an authenticator app (ie google authenticator).  No java exploit can touch that.  Also you should disable auto-java if you are regularly keep yourself logged in at sites with a sig amount of bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-05-09 15:22:19
I completely disagree with your analogy to a stock.  A stock’s value is not just based on “trust.”  It represents a claim to an ownership of the company’s assets and future cash flows.  Its value is based on the projected cash flows from the business.  But I do agree that it requires you to trust the system and the management / board of the company.  Bitcoin’s value is solely derived from the fact that you think in the future people will accept it as payment.  So it is completely based on trust, so I don’t understand the statement, “then we should do everything we can to keep from building systems that require trust in us.” 
Also I did not say “evil banks and governments.”  I said big banks and huge government.  I support the rule of law and regulated, well-run banks that serve industries.  I do not support banks that are “too big too fail,” take on ridiculous amount of risk, engage in fraud to grow their business (HSBC with money laundering for drug carterls, LIBOR scandal, encouraging mortgage applicants to lie on their applications, etc.), and generally do not care about their customers / society.  I also do not like governments run by the pawns of industry, crony capitalists, and war mongerers.  Nor do I like governments that refuse to punish banks for their fraud and reinforce the ever increasing moral hazard in the banking industry.
I also disagree that the only legitimate reason to store money in bitcoin is due to political views.  It is also very useful for people with highly irresponsible central banks (Argentina, Africa, Iran, Russia, etc) and people that are worried about depositor taxes (Europe) or strict capital controls (China).  If you believe that these people will start to buy bitcoins in ever increasing numbers in the future, then I think you have a legitimate reason to invest in bitcoins as well.
I do agree that it is very risky investment though and you should definitely only invest what you can lose.  But if you genuinely believe it is a good investment, I don’t think it is irresponsible to share your viewpoint.  But yes, to suggest that it can only increase in value and that there are not great risks, that is irresponsible.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:31:12
Obviously its really tough to predict for many reasons.  Personally I think the main factor is whether or not the Chinese start to buy it.  It is likely because they have strict capital controls, they are used to bubbles, and they like to gamble.
3 years from now:
30% 700+
20% $20 or less (alternate, superior cryptocurrency introduced in about 18 months)

I am not so sure about your analysis.  Many savvy, seasoned bitcoiners were buying during that time as well.  The time scale you are looking at is very short and the dip was pretty small.  Also the attacker may have initiated a large sell at the start in order to try to trigger the panic.  He would have to be able to perfectly predict the bottom to profit (he may have waited too long thinking it would drop further).
DDoS attacks on that scale are very expensive (from what I have heard).  He may not have been profitable.  I think the bitcoin community responded very well.
@_date: 2013-07-29 14:24:45

@_date: 2013-05-10 14:34:48
Absolutely!  This is very much needed if we ever want to help middle-aged to old people store their wealth in bitcoins.  Or even just less tech savvy people of all ages.
A person that is using their "Sparky1" as their password knows that it is just very unsafe for them to get involved with bitcoin at the moment.
