Oh good question.  I'm not sure the exact number but it was not cheap.  I would say probably close to about 500$ when you account for hardware,  electricity,  and time I spent learning and building my miner. It was never profitable,  but I didn't do it as an investment,  only a hobby.  
@_date: 2016-04-15 20:29:02
Well the time was not really factored in as a dollar value,  I first stated mining using my computer to learn the ropes, it was a gtx 660 but I already had it so not any real cost. Put together a mine using a raspberry pi, 2 graphics cards that I owned with a cx750 psu which I bought for about 80 bucks.  Later on I used the same psu and a second hand antminer s3 which I got on ebay for 110$ that is the miner I'm still running today.  I spend about $.70 a day on electricity for the mining but the revenue of btc in usd is about $1.30 so I figured hardware or if pocket was about 200 and electricity over the year and a half about 300. Might be a bit more or less but I would ballpark $500

 I see that wallet as empty,  no transaction history at all.  Also I suggest posting a link like that instead of your wallet address so your not violating the community guidelines,  specificity :
No wallet addresses in posts/comments. The tipbot can be used. 
Not that I'm personally bothered by it,  especially since your not asking for coins which is the intention of that guideline, but it could be a thing,  who knows.

Regulation is a good thing for large entities like corporations and banks to instill confidence in the system and legitimize the protocol.  It needs to be done very lightly though as crypto is so small and new to the world's market that too strict regulation could be a detriment.  It's a delicate balance, will be interesting to see what happens

The only one?  That one is so huge you need the entire bockchain.  I mean that's fine for now while it's only like 35 gigs but what about 3 years from now?  I don't have the resources to use that much storage on my wallet
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:17:51
I would say for 100 bucks you could get a used s3 and psu, and that would generate about .15 XBC in a month. That's based on my personal mining rig since that's what I do. The power cost increase for a single s3 is trivial enough to be unnoticed, just be a bit more energy aware in your other electricity uses. Like swap some light bulbs with low energy ones and turn your ac up (hier ttemp so it dosn't run as much) and no one will notice

I'm sorry if it came across as a pitch for a job or income opportunity, its just a free and relativity anonymous way too get a trivial amount of bits to throw around on forums like this. 
Like all week of randomly doing this in my free time I think adds up to less than 4USD
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:40:20
Pool,  I'm at slush's pool and I get about 0.01 in payouts every 2 days with one antminer s3. That payout is averaged over 3 months now (before that I was at antpool) and the hash rate has been around 430gh. I got the gear used for about 120$ because I went for a more pricy psu, it's a 750w one but you don't need that much.  The s3 only draws about 330w at the wall. 
Today's price puts me at about $36 per month so with free electricity you might see a ROI for such a hobbyist setup, but please go in considering it a hobby expense not an investment
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:13:58

In my experience those IRA accounts got me 5-10% on a good  year where bitcoin does it in a good day. of course that is not to say that this is a better move. as far as risk goes bitcoin is near the top of the list of risky investments from a traditional standpoint. no one should clean out their IRA accounts to invest if they cannot afford the risk, not to mention its inherently foolish to invest all in one place.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:45:11
Lol I just took the tax hit to take the money out of my IRA and used that to buy BTC and ETH directly. It's a little less than ideal as I had to pay a bit over 20% in taxes but the account was only growing about 4-6% per year over the last 3 years and my personal portfolio was outperforming the IRA by a factor of over 100. So far I have made back more than 3x what I put in from my IRA and will be able to swallow the withdrawal fees entirely  with profit. That and I got my BCC as well as have sole control of the bitcoins.
Those bitcoin and ethereum holdings have grown more in the last 2 month than the IRA had in the previous 3 years. Oh and I now have access to the money whenever I want, none of that wait till I'm retired and hope I'm in good enough health to enjoy my savings.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:27:42
I mean to invest in the bank roll at the casino. so you put your coin up as the bankroll so the casino can offer higher bets and make more money since their edge is a % function so the more volume they have the more they make over time.
In exchange for your coins you get your share of the winnings or loosing of the house proportional to the % of the total house bankroll your supplying.  Mathematically you should see a return as over time the odds favor the house. It seemed that the bank roll was turning over once every 2 weeks or so where i "invested" so i made my 1% or so every 2 weeks. i have since stopped though since i don;t like not being in control of my coins, and have yet to find a place to invest where i trust enough. Staking and mining and day trading is more my game now.

@_date: 2017-08-04 05:14:58
I like Gemini or Coinbase for doing limit order trading like on the stock market.
I also like Exodus or Jaxx for trading with no accounts or ID through ShapeShift. 
The first 2 the exchange holds your keys and you trust them to play fair, the second 2 you hold your keys and are the first and last party to have access to them so it comes with all that privacy but risk of user error.

Its fun, i made a bit of money and learned a good amount about cryptography. I also really like all the stupid offshoots and ICO mania, i turned my bit of money into a larger amount playing that game. 
But most of all my personal opinion of BTC is that it is accessible, to everyone, everywhere. and best of all, no matter how large my personal stack gets, i will never be able to limit anyone's access to the network. even if i have 20,999,999BTC and you have 1, we both have the same access to the network and i cannot make your 1BTC worth less than 1BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:44:12
I think they will make a user friendly way to separate out your BCH but they will not support it in the interface. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:53:02
yeah that's definitely the ideal. during the Bitcoin Cash split i kept most of my coins in my own wallet but was very happy to have left an amount on Bittrex as they were made available for trading very shortly after the split and i was able to participate in lucrative trading during a very volatile time. 
It took me a solid 2 weeks to vet a wallet i trusted enough to import my old BTC seed (after sending the associated BTC to a new wallet) so i could access the BCC and send some of it to an exchange. by the time i got that BCC to the exchange the volatility had settled and it hasn't gone over .25BTC per BCC since, not yet.

you missed the point. "It helps, but..." unless you think people like Donald Trump are examples of intellect. All i'm saying is being smart does not mean you will make money. you can point at your own story as much as you want but if your suggesting that is normal or even possible for everyone then you might need to get some more perspective. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:39:14
oh gotcha. no you don't. the paper wallet is great. That is your private key for the coins associated with that address on the network. If the network splits, that will be still be the private key for that address on the network (both networks if the address existed before the split)
your paper wallet would hold both BTC and the new chain coin, you would just have to use it with the appropriate client.
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:26:51
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:11:45
No, I am disagreeing with your notion that being smart and having money are directly related. The parent commentor may or may not be deluded but I am saying this: "if he really was so smart he could beat the market he could become a billionaire. It wouldn't even be hard with a 20 year timeline." Is not true for the average person. Opportunity is the key factor and the system is rigged to limit that opportunity.

oh, January 1st is a ways away. i suppose it matters on if you want to be in control of when and where your coins are. If you don't mind the way coin-base proposes to handle them and you trust them to play fair with your money then it seems like keeping them there is ok. If you want to be in a position where you are the first and last point of contact to your coins and you are responsible for your own security and storage, then a wallet is the option for you. 
It really depends on how involved you want to be and how much control you are comfortable giving a third party in exchange for convenience and customer service.

Its really hard to isolate the factors or decide whats the primary one.
 I think there is a good amount of disagreement in the core community of bitcoin about how best to address scalability, which creates uncertainty about a hard fork and should put downward market pressure on the price.
At the same time the ETF chatter is back up waiting for a May 15 decision creating investor speculation and upward pressure. 
on top of all that we have constant news of bitcoin adoption and regulation on the horizon which creates speculation value. 
There is also the organic growth Bitcoin is experiencing driving the demand up and by extension the price. 
Im having a hard time predicting anything at the moment so im gonna hold. I do feel that short to medium term BTC will see a bit of a price drop, that's just a guess though

Now sure 100k in taxes does not make a difference in your lifestyle if your pulling half a million a year, but 10k in taxes when you make 50k a year is a huge deal. Fuck taxes and fuck people who go straight to "young people bla bla bla" there is a real problem and young people are hit extra hard since we got fucked by student loans. (If you of the generation who payed their way through colage with a summer job let me tell you that is imposible today) Try living in NYC, LA, Seattle, or any major city and see if you can make it on 50k gross, and then see if you are content with the % tax margine your expected to pay.

@_date: 2017-09-09 23:33:43
the way I do it is I hold balances of BTC and Fiat on several exchanges and will, for example, buy BTC on a China exchange while selling some BTC in a USA exchange. I'll do this for a bit of profit then wait for an opportunity to sell on the Chinese exchange when I buy on the US one. for this strategy, you need a lot of money on several accounts, but it is instant profit with basically no counter party risk. 
This sort of arbitrage opportunity is not rare in Bitcoin and if you have yourself set up correctly, you can make some very profitable moves very quickly.

Are there no exchanges operating in Canada that will sell you the coins today?  Usually you need to link you're credit card and bank account to do instant purchases on an exchange.

Try and buy some locally would be the alternatives. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 03:50:14

What about litecoin's confirmation time,  I wouldn't say there is no benefite over bitcoin. I could see the gold and silver senario,  bitcoin being used more for larger transactions as it is more secure, slower,  and more transaction fee costly. And litecoin as silver since it's better for smaller transactions,  it's faster, cheaper,  and also secure, just not as secure since it's a smaller network

It's covenant when you have it and to use as a secure, cheap and fast international transfer mechanic,  but the on and off ramps to move from bitcoin to local currency are very pricy and relativity invasive and inconvenient, and most places don't accept it as outright curency so you do have to use those on and off ramps to spend it as money. At the moment I view it more as a stock in the network.  So an investment with the speculation that the technology will become more widely adopted and the finite trade mechanism of the technology will be thought after and consequently appreciate in value. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 18:44:38
I think it's still trying to figure out what its value is after such a large bubble and with so many new coins coming into the market through mining every day,  there needs to be a demand of close to a 1 million $ a day of new money to keep the price where it is.  I think will see a bit more upwards momentum if the technology keeps being adopted, when the mining revenue halves again, and new coins are not as avalable.

You are not understanding market voliyility. You should not buy bitcoin with the idea that it will increase in value and generate a profit in a month.  you haven't soled the coins so you haven't realized any losses and is a common practice, especially for new speculators/investors to closely monitor the price and freak out and slell at a loss after having hastily bought in.  If you bought 1 month ago you should have seen that  the market tend had been moving down for almost 6 month relativity constantly and should have anticipated a loss. I wouldn't worry so much about the day to day price fluctuation, that's only gonna stress you out.  If you  in fact bought the coins as an investment it should not be expected to mature in 30 days

@_date: 2015-04-15 22:30:55
What's the different between android wallet and desktop wallet? I have 2 different account?
Each wallet acts as a new set of keys one private and one public,  the phone wallet and the desktop wallet are in fact 2 different independent wallets. If you want to hold bitcoin in your own wallet,  grab something like multibit or another thin wallet and use the public keys from that as the destination address for where u send your purchased coins from whatever exchange you bought them at.  I suggest multibit since it's small,  easy to understand and secure enough for small amounts of coin.  You can even create the wallet offline if you like.  PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO BACKUP YOU PRIVATE KEYS SAFELY

Not bitcoin by itself,  you need to pay capitol gains on your btc if you didn't mine them,  but if they are part of your Roth ira then you can bypass the Capitol gains tax.

Yup, truth.  I was really into the idea at first but much like you I came to that same conclusion before buying in
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:23:43
My understanding is that the 24 word phrase is a key generating seed that is used to generate your private keys that are stored on the the trezor.  The phrase itself is not the key but it is used to generate all your keys because the algorithm is hyerchticly deterministic and can therfore generate a bunch of new addresses that can still be recovered using the seed they were spawned with. 
Backup is saving your private keys (or means of getting them,  like the phrase) in a second location that is not compromised should the first location be. 
Recovery is using the backup keys to re-synchronize a wallet that had preveousely been lost
@_date: 2015-04-04 23:22:49
Sure it helps,  I think people are much more willing to try something new if the infrastructure to convert back to the familiar exists and is proven.
some day we might be able to send bitcoin across boarders to be used as local and international currency,  but for now it helps to have a direct line to the status quo   
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:41:07
Well unless the price of bitcoin almost dubbles, or the amount of transactions per day significantly increase so that mining incentives remain lucrative from price or transaction fees,  won't the network shrink and consequently: 1 be less secure and more open to attack and less worthwhile as a secure transaction methods, probably not super significant. 2 won't the most profitable miners end up being a collection of a hand full of large corporations who will then essentially centralize the mining and control the new supply of bitcoin in a more central way.  3 isn't the security of bitcoins network based on a healthy decentralized network of miners and those miners are compensated for their expenses by the fees payed by the transactions on the network,  so there would have to be much more traffic to keep mining not profitable but even viable. unless the user base about dubbles and the transaction volume dubbles to keep the mining revenue constant, otherwise won't the fees need to dubble or the miners need to Scale down to reach a more reasonable equilibrium. All that or the price needs to come up

Yeah I think so to in that regard.  But for now at least I think it's appropriate. I think the average consumer is also put off by the complicated process of managing your own wallets and having no central backup incase they fuck up,  no one to blame or make loss clames to is really a new concept in regards to finance.  to be clear I know it's not that complicated and I do understand how it works but the average person who is not mining or Day trading or anything other than a user of bitcoin as a means of transacting, that user is likely to be put off by the complexity of managing a secure wallet 100% alone

Social change on such a scale does not happen fast,  the clames made in this article don't seem to factor that in.  In order for the current paradigm to shift so dramatically there would have to be some large scale event or action taken,  I'm not sure if whoever wrote this thinks that if the government were to make an unpopular decision like making cash transactions limited or illegal, that the people would just be ok with it and let it happen, look at gun law reform as a reference

 Greece is a bad example they use the euro which isn't losing its value like the dollar "take a dump" hypothetical I was entertain. They are in debt but the currency still holds its value and is still backed by the EU's central bank. (Like the usd and our debt to China)
as for the toilet paper,  notice I lead with gold.  Then said even cash as a call back to people's unfamiliarity with bitcoin, suggesting that cash might be better in this sort of highly unlikely senario since people know and trust it, meaning they might accept it more readely than bitcoin.

I was all about bitcoin for a while but there are a few things that have since gotten me to slow my holdings roll.  1)while I'm sure the technology is revolutionary, I'm not 100% sure bitcoin will be the best candidate as the definite future of crypto and bockchain tech.  2)the scalability issue still keeps me from fully beleaving this tech can become universally adopted and actually be able to support the amount of transactions that would bring,  while still being able to have the dispersed nodes maintaining the blockchains integrity. I have seem a few suggested fixes but they are not realities yet and some would take an unrealistic amount of cooperation across the entire network. In the mean time I'm still a fan though

I always loved how accessible investing in btc is. U can start with minimum amounts around 10$ at most exchanges and the transaction fee will be the same as if u buy 100, 1000 or 10000 at a time.

1. Find a local bitcoin atm and trade physical cash for bitcoins, no personal info required, but expect to pay a premium price.

It can crash the mining and cause rejected shares when your overclock is not stabile but the sweet spot is different per algorithm and you'll have to adjust you gpu maximize profitability depending on which altcoin you are mining. 
My 1080ti for example outputs much better H/W when mining ethereum when it is underclocked in power consumption to 60%
 (2.4 h/w on stock settings, 4.0 h/w underclocked)
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:19:41
so how will the fees be increased?  Is that part of the algorithm or will that have to come from users on a per transaction basis, potentially where transactions with higher fees will be minded first and faster,  potentially giving users the ability to expodite chosen transactions at will or does it not work like that and there is a different method that will help incentives the mining and continue securing the network?

Can't I just deposit say 5BTC, then withdraw 10 seeing as they matched my first deposit? 
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:43:47
Unfortunately no. i feel like they are all very high risk. the bitbay one looks very appealing. their BTC price is also very low compared to many other markets. Could be because they are so small and have uncertain issues with the government. lol Its all very risky. I keep about 90% of all my block-chain assets in offline wallets. but i did put .1 BTC in at bitbays arbitrage fund, well see if that's still a thing this time next year. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 06:52:10
You can break BTC down to 8 decimal places so the smallest amount you can buy is 0.00000001
Overstock takes bitcoins and has been around for a while selling electronics and shipping them everywhere.

It is amazing! People are genuinely trying to help you understand something you are clearly confused/misinformed about and you respond as though there is no chance you could be wrong. Just Entertain the concept that there might be something left to learn. there is no shame in not understanding a complex protocol like cryptocurrency fully.
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:20:53
Not if people all over the place run nodes or contribute to the mining, you know in a decentralized sort of way. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:26:04
I started using Gemini, its also USA based and your cash holdings are FDIC insured from what i understand. but the biggest benefit is the lower fees. 
You can also place limit orders on gemini which you cannot do on coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 00:49:58
I think if your looking to use it as an investment,  buy incrementally. Buy like 20 bucks today, theprice is good at the moment (subjective).  Then wait watch and research.  Then buy another trivial amount like 20 bucks a few weeks later if the price seems appealing.  This way you are not too invested and you can accumulate a good amount of bitcoin without putting yourself into financial strain. also it will make you invested in bitcoin and give you incentive to monitor it
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:47:13
thats true i guess but i don't think Alts are going anywhere. also if mining becomes unprofitable i can still use the GPU to play video games and to render things for the post production work i do. its much more of a useful item than a dedicated miner, and for my situation a better "investment" 
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:09:55
Right so in the future like say even only 5 years if the current growth trend of the blockchain remains consistent  a node may have to be able to support several pedabits and be growing at a rate that is, with current technology,  unsustainable

I bought for 300 and thought I blew it when it dropped to 250. Not to bad anymore
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:40:26
just buy in small increments once a day or week or so and you'll not take a hard hit when the price fluctuates. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:37:54
I love investing because it causes me to research all the blockchain projects going on and some are very objectively interesting. I feel like you would have done much better if you diversified your investment into like 10 coins whos underlying functionality or purpose you like and then trade back when you come up 10% or so. then find some more coins and repeat.  monitoring news and forum chatter and announcements is a great indication of an altcoin starting a bull run. and like you said dont go all in.
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:39:08
I see so that's what HD wallet is.  So in such a wallet your not baking up the key but the seed that spawns it?  Is it more or less or equally safe to use a wallet that only requires a fraction of the bockchain to ruin, like multibit,  or is it more advisable to use one that requires the full ledger like bitcoin core? Why is one better? Is there inerrant risk in having a large amount of coins in any given wallet? Does a light wallet like multibit have the ability to hold your coins for 10+ years even though it's not looking at the entire bockchain history?  How does it know of your transactions or balance if its not looking at a the entire bockchain,  but rather a small pice of the blockchain?  Sorry for all the questions but you seem to have a solid grasp on this

My guess,  speculators pulling out as a result of a pending   user information demand from theSwedish government to a Swedish based exchange.  The exchange is challenging the requests on legal ground but if the courts rule in favor of the government the users privacy and anonymity would be greatly reduced and it could have detrimental residual effects on other bitcoin users.
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:51:06
Is it safe?  Depends, is it on an exchaing or in your own wallet,  will you remember the password or where u keep you private keys. You can sit on it and maybe have some non-trivial amount in the future but I wouldn't hold my breath

Ok so at some point in bitcoins end game there will have to emerge an equilibrium between the miners and the fees, so that the fees will support the miners, but in such a senario the hahrate of the network would in my opinion have to continue to increase in order for competing miners to remain relevant. This sort off equilibrium would keep the value of bitcoin very stable and even support deflation as user error will inevitably lead to some coins being lost forever linked to misplaced or inaccessible private keys.
How very interesting.  Thanks for helping me understand

I wil not ever sell,  I'll use them as currency while they are worth more than I payed for them otherwise I'll sit on them.  I'm not losing money if I don't sell, not realized losses anyway. I'm cureous to see what will happen when the mining rewards are halved though

Like with any sort of equity,  my gains and losses are not realized until i sell.  That's what I mean.  Like I bought let's say 1 BTC for 290. The price now is closer to 260. I haven't actually lost anything since I still have my 1BTC and I haven't soled.  There is a perceived loss of 30 bucks but by holding I haven't had any realized losses, that price might go to 320 tomorrow and I won't have made any money ether, having not soled or spent the coin.  That's what I Was trying to say. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:30:31
well that clear up a bit of my confusion,  what is a recommended HD wallet which only needs to have the seed backed up once,  that sounds like the way to go for long term storage of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:04:25
My 2 cents, or whatever the bitcoin equivalent is,  a birthday is not the appropriate forum to try to introduce someone to bitcoin.  It's not nessesarly a bad gift but it does sound like an underhanded pitch for bitcoin. if u asked someone what they want them get them what they said,  otherwise get them whatever you think they will like Based on your Relationship.  That said I would love some bitcoin for my birthday
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:01:42
I have used coinbase for years to buy my bitcoins and ethereum and now I guess litecoin too. I don't keep my coins there but the way u go about it is I chose my cash wallet and then deposit money from my bank account. Then when the money is cleared u can buy the crypto instantly
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:45:00
Definitely a buyers market at the moment
@_date: 2017-07-03 05:16:52
the amount you see in nicehash will not move to your coinbase wallet until the balance is high enough on a Tuesday. NiceHash pays out once per week (Tuesday) if your balance is over the payout threshold. if you click the "view my progress online" link in the interface it will take you to a webpage that will tell you when your next payout schedule is, along with some analytics of your mining. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:43:57
I use coinbase and they exchaing to fiat for their standard 1% fee once you reach 15$ so that's an option, they also tend to exchange at a few points over the current trade price, also good if your going btc&gt;usd
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:22:05
If u wanna gamble in online casinos using cryptocurrency or specificity bitcoin I do this with bitcoins on the site moneypot.com and with altcoins on cryptogames.net
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:42:57
So when you have a coinbase wallet it is basically coinbase holding your funds and crediting your account with the amount. When you want to withdraw or transfer them your just click the Send/Request tab in coinbase and send the coins to another address. 
Most people will recommend you keep your coins in a wallet to which you hold the private keys (so no 3ed party can control your funds, but also no 3ed party can help you recover your password should user error occur)
But if you make an account on another exchange like Gemini you will just have to go to the deposit location and it will provide you with a bitcoin address for depositing bitcoin into the exchange hosted wallet. you then just paste that adders in the send/receive section of coinbase and send the bitcoins to your new exchange wallet. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:41:35
Lol nice,  thanks for the visual aide 
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:38:39
what you should do for a chain split is pull the coins off the exchange into a wallet  you control the private keys to, then if there is a split you will have the balance on both chains. after the split you can send the coins back to the exchange account, and be left with the offshoot chain bitcoin. 
if you don't care to do that there is no reason to sell them on the exchange and buy back after the split. you just give them control over which chain to follow so check with the exchange and then see if you agree with how they will handle the split. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:54:02

Sorry are you buying or selling? I'm unfamiliar with the [H][W] shorthand
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:33:59
sure, first off here is a link to see my mining profit over the past 2 weeks or so. 
I downloaded Nicehash miner here: 
install that and run the benchmark. then just put in a BTC address you wanna be payed out to and hit start. that's literally it. you don't have to join a pool or point your hash power in any direction since nicehash handles all that. you just specify where you wanna be payed out to and hit run.
for added efficiency i downloaded EVGA Precision XOC:  
Run this software before you mine and use it to under or over clock your gpu for the best efficiency for your gpu. I ended up throttling the power down to 60% and overclocking the GPU Clock offset by +240MHz and under clocked the MEM Clock Offset -300MHz this brought my H/W from around 2.4 upt to 4. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:49:23
It took me over 1 year to mine my first full bitcoin, straight hashing SHA256 ! lol you get there eventually. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:35:43
that would be great. right now this sort of thing is extremely risky. there is no confirmable transparency and they hold your funds. Its all trust based at the moment. I only do it with about 1 BTC at a time. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:16:56
Lol I don't think it's a choice for them. Not like you can just pick what block to mine and ignore fees, at least as far as I understand.  Please correct me if I'm wrong I want to learn

I think its a smart move to make purchasing choices with your wife's input. You 2 are a team after all. I bought back in 2013 and wanted to buy about 5x what my husband was comfortable with, so I only bought what we both felt ok with. today i might not have as much BTC as i would have had i not listened to him, but i am still happily married and at the end of each day that is more important to me than my BTC balance. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:46:45
The issue im thinking is if miners shut of because of lower revenue then the bitcoin network will be less secure and the price might drop as people lose faith in the weakening system,  snowballing the effect
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:22:09
that is shitty. wow i didn't know that, but i did always wonder how i was able to get several sequential blocks within seconds back when i used my S3 to mine with the antpool. Very interesting. it sounds like they are part of the problem when it comes to the slow confirmation times lately.

you sell,  I'm buying
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:57:42
The BTC sound like they have landed at gemini with no issue, the delay is on their end crediting your account with the BTC. i would open a ticket if the balance does not update within 2 hours or so. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:18:52
I see, it looks like it is operating in my region but it still wants me to upload some ID pics and info. I think i will keep on Buying with Gemini and then trading with no id on Poloniex and shapeshift. Good suggestion thought, i would have been stoked if my login info just let me trade on this exchange. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:37:06

i think the entire concept is peer to peer so fund managers by nature come with scam risk. the best way to not get scammed is to manage your own portfolio. that said, if you do wanna trust someone to manage your coins there are plenty of places offering intrest for investments into trading funds. i make about 10.98% compounding daiely on an arbitrag trading funds but i dont controll the bitcoins and if they screw me im out of the investment (only put in .1BTC to test it for a while) there is also funds that offer liquidity to exchange sites that will pay intrest. some of those are ok oppertunities but they all carry that scam risk
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:54:10
Oh cool, can u share with us the details? 
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:45:32
Makes sense to me,  although that would assume that the bitcoin price will have to jump significantly in 2016 to keep miners profitable.  that or the number of transactions would have to increase 100x over to generate mining revenue from transaction fees.

What?! You cannot send coins from one chain to another if there is a fork. If someone did what you discribed they would end up with the original amount less mining fees.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:26:39
you can trade a bit now and a bit later, maybe spread it out so you don't commit the full 200 all at once.

Traditional ira and 401k accounts are great for traditional jobs with tradition income structures. If your someone like me who works basicly exclusively freelance and with months of unemployment between jobs sometimes, then bitcoin makes more sense as a retirement fund (personally). I don't think someone with a company match 401k plan should opt out in favor of btc, but since I don't have that and need access to my long term savings should I not find more work, btc is awesome.

I buy my coins on Gemini. its very straight forward and accessible for most people in the United States. Giv it a try, much lower fees than coin bass and you dont have to wait for your money to clear before making purchases if you transfer in from your bank at a rate of $500 a day or less which sounds like a buying range that would work for you. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:59:44
260 I still have maybe 30% of it definitely playing with the house's money at this point. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:42:54
If you do the alt coin thing like me you can buy a GTX1080TI for about 700, it comes with a 3 year warranty, i am able to make back my 700 in about 5 month while still factoring in the cost of electric. then you have 2.5 years left on warranty, not to mention that GPU will run VR games at 120FPS and every video game i ever tried at max settings. Its a great card for post production pros as well and definitely has a healthy after market of people looking to buy used to upgrade their gaming Riggs on a budget. I am very happy with my "investment" into this GPU. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:58:12
YES!! to all of this! I would go as far as to say: do not invest anything into the sites I mentioned or anything similar, you're basically handing someone you don't know money and hoping they will do as they say. if they don't you WILL BE OUT ALL THE COINS YOU "INVEST" and will have no way to hold anyone accountable.

@_date: 2017-06-23 03:07:02
Yup thats what i tend to do... especially when the market gets volatile. when they are less volatile i scale down to like 5%
the current ask price seems to be around 0.01860007 so i would think this asking price you set should hit some time in the next few hours. Good luck and keep me posted on how it goes for you. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:53:09
you are credited with the amount immediately up to $500 per day. you can trade and do whatever you like with it, but you will not be able to withdraw until the transfer completes in 4-5 days. you should not be charged a fee for this, at least i never pay a fee for depositing money from BoA. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:19:02

yup, im holding till after Auguse 1st when i can hopefully send some lower fee transactions. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:27:27
Its impossible to know for sure but research on forums, Reddit, and slack in communities of people who trade a lot is a great indicator of price movement. For example i expect DCR to have some short term growth potential because it was recently added to Shape-shift, and will more than likely see support from some of the big multi asset lite wallets, like Exodus and JAXX. This in turn means more people will have access to acquire DCR and the demand should drive the price up nicely in the next few days. I also personally like the DCR Project and feel it is worth my while to make some trades in the hopes of reversing them for profit short term, but if i'm wrong about the profit potential i will hold the DCR more long term, having only invested an amount i am comfortable keeping tied up in a long position. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:27:40
are you sure your looking at the reoccurring transactions for the correct currency. like if your order is for ETH and your looking in BTC it will appear empty. its simple to overlook
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:57:55

@_date: 2017-06-23 04:52:25
it means that someone who held ether probably from the start soled a shit tone of it and then probably immediately bought it back for pennies on the dollar. it means that a single exchange is subject to massive price manipulation by a single whale and if traders are using stop loss and margin trading a single whale can exploit opportunity to the tune of millions. if that's what your asking. OR it means don't margin trade and don't stop loss your assets in such a volatile market. Maybe place a buy order at $0.15 and hope history repeats.
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:46:15
if it is already sent then there is no way to send it again, no harm in trying as there should be no balance to pull funds from for mining fees or the transaction. If its an error on a hosted exchange then you might get lucky and double your holdings at the exchanges expense. (at which point you should make them aware of the issue, its also very unlikely)  
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:01:27
double the money in Exodus right, just to clarify. Is Copay a wallet that uses XRP to store and transfer BTC and other coins? if so you might have just been the winner of a "bank error in your favor" Same thing happend to me at GateHub wallet, i was able to withdraw 2x my total balance and once it was in exodus it was mine to keep (was like 10 ETH too so i was stoked).

If they add it tonight at 10Pm an you buy right then (im planning on it) you will likely do well. Last time when they added GNT i bought right away at $0.10 trading for close to $0.60 like 6 weeks later.

If you bought it and don't have any limit sell orders for it open it will stay in your exchange wallet at the price you bought at. 
The way i tend to trade is: buy anything at whatever price, place a sell order for that amount at a higher price and then another buy at a lower price. with healthy market movements and with my buy/sell prices about 5-10% apart most of my trades trigger while i sleep and in the morning i reassess the price and reset the orders. Yesterday i was able to trade BTC to ETH back and forth 29x at 7% each time. what a lovely day.  
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:22:10
you can also trade on Gemini with btc eth and usd and any pair of those 3 with limit orders. and the fee for coin to coin is like .25% even for low denomination purchases and trades. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:05:38
Only other thing i can think is that both transactions were sent through different nodes and you essentially double spent your coins to yourself, if this is the case than the balance should correct itself as more blocks are confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:38:27
no, mining has 0 effect on price, it is a means of securing the network. price is a product of supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:14:23
whats the problem with ShapeShift? i use them a lot and am not aware of an issue. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:53:10
Interesting, might remain swollen for a minute while all this BTC bs is sorted then perhaps. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:16:42
shit hole? lol we have wildly different experiences of this city
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:37:33
yes you can, i recommend sending them a small amount first, confirming it was received, then sending the full amount.
This way you don't spend 2x the network fees (compared to sending it to your own wallet first)
Only do it directly from the exchange if the recipient is operating "above board" BTW, dont want your account to be banned or frozen or whatever. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:39:47
I built a kick ass pc from used parts for about $1200 and i would say it has a re-sail value of about what i payed. It mines alt coins and makes me about $9 in BTC per day or about 0.0031BTC per day for the last 2 months already. I also stake Reddcoins, Black coins, Peer coins, and other Proof of Stake coins while it mines. On top of that i can use the PC to play VR games, power my home entertainment center and eventually join the Golem network. I would say buying PCs is better in that it has way more re-sail value and general utility, but you cannot mine BTC directly. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:44:57
Its a good idea to invest long term. in the short term you might see some losses but remember they are not realized until you sell. If you are inclined to panic sell at the sight of potential loss you might be better off holding your money as it sounds like you need it. 
If however you can stomach some risk and be ok with the potential of some short term loss because you holding for at least a year or so, you'll do well. I suggest going 50/50 BTC/ETH  Both have promises and are widely available.

in the USA Gemini has the lowest fees from my experience.

he knows how to make profitable trades regardless of price direction.
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:50:29
Wow, right on! Well put. Someone with a lot of coin can still manipulate the price on an exchange though. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:25:00
Yeah it is. on second thought most of it is a shit hole. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:49:15
that's what i'm saying to, you'll have more coins but wont be able to consolidate them in one wallet. only one of those chains will be Bitcoin, you cannot double your coins by forking, and if you make your own fork you'll have one chain of BTC and one chain of worthlessness. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:54:07
I keep some of my BTC in the Exodus wallet, its been my favorite application as far as user friendly and interface goes. they do need to add some more security features before i put more value in it. 
I do love how you can hold many different coins in this wallet though and you control the private keys. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:05:10
i think people are irritated because your hypotheticals don't demonstrate understanding of the existing protocol. Its like your asking "well why male models" after David Duchovny just spelled it with a montage.
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:01:12
You sort of discribed arbitrage trading. It's a great way to make profitable low risk trades but you need high limits, lots of btc and lots of cash spread across several exchanges to make a significant amount of money doing this. And prepare to pay capitol gains on all those trades. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:04:22
In the US Bitcoins are  “intangible property” and are taxed accordingly. They are subject to capitol gains and other taxes, look up IRS Notice 2014-21 for more info. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:13:38
go Gemini, i used coinbase for over 3 years but lately they have much higher fees and constantly offline when volume is up. That said someone just filled the entire order book for ETH over there by selling something like 50,000ETH at once. Great news for people with open orders. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:27:45
yup I have been pulling around $400 per month for the last 2 month mining just with my 2 home computers. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:32:40
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:37:27
I imagine you will get your money in a not so timely manor, i never had such an issue with Gemini but i tend to put money in with a direct bank transfer at a rate of $500  per day. that way you can instantly trade with the money and only need to wait for the transactions to clear in order to withdraw from the exchange. It sucks but i am not worried that your money was stolen or misplaced, just not efficiently handled. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:56:37
use an alt coin like LTC or Doge or one of the big ones with low fees and then when you have a few shapeshift it to BTC
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:40:18
yeah their analytics tools are lacking I tend to analyze the market trends for them on 3ed party charts (like Coinigy) then make trades on there.  
the fees im seeing are 0.25% for buying and selling. the fees stay the same for all denominations until they cap at $0.01 so any amount that incurs a fee lower than 0.01 will round up to 0.01
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:05:04
at an exchange: Coinbase, Gemini, Polenex and many others, those are just the USA ones i use
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:12:42
Currently its down to like $365 per month and Im not factoring power cost into that. But hey i get cheep electric and have these nice GPUs so why not. I actually bought the 1070 after making enough mining with the 1080TI to buy it outright.
[edit to add this]
Running a gpu for a long time at high temperature will ware it out faster, but i throttle my gpus power down to 60% which doesn't seem to effect my hash-rate but it improves my efficiency (H/W) as well as keep the GPU core temp around 65C on the 1080TI and 58C on the 1070 very acceptable for 24/7 use
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:39:26
Fuck yeah you would have, gpu at mining is a blast still right now. I'm pulling like 350 per month with  only 2 GPUS
Haven't turned my asic rig on in o very a year now
@_date: 2017-06-26 04:43:02
if where they are is not a hosted wallet like an exchange

If you don't want to pay taxes on your coins, mine them or simply HODL

you might see that DCR in a few minutes it looks like. nice little dip just happened
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:09:57
i imagine its a safe bet that the person who soled off 100k also bought back a large amount of his stack at 0.10 per ETH. who would manipulate the price down so masterfully and then not take profit?
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:20:05
you must have the balance in your account to place a limit order. unless you margin trade but please don't. its really easy to loose all your money due to shit like a "Flash Crash" like yesterday on GDAX lol all those poor chumps were forced to sell all their ETH at $0.10. Better to know what your doing and trade with what you own
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:13:24
2400 seems high but i bought at $250. I have some buy orders waiting for $2000 and below but if not then im happy too lol. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:46:48
i learned from years of fucking up lol. but i do agree there is great potential in DCR. I trade it regardless in an effort to walk away with more than i bought. in your case here is my strategy. 
Buy DCR with the $30 you have in polo, im just gonna assume it buys you 1DCR for simplicity. now i would set a sell order for that 1DCR for BTC but about 5% more BTC than you bought it for (accounting for fees as well) then when that order triggers, buy back 1.1DCR for the same price you just soled the 1DCR for. It may take hours days or weeks sometimes for orders to reverse but they almost always do. 
that was a simple example but i was doing this yesterday with BTC and ETH and i started with 1.4BTC and 6ETH and at the end of the day i had 1.65BTC and 8ETH just going back and forth and back and forth lol
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:53:24
Then u might be forced to deal with the slow Customer Support to rectify this. i had an issue with some referral bonus being charged to my account and i just gave up on getting it fixed, its been about a month. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:41:23
WTF why not put the 10k into a Money market account until you figure out what you wanna invest in. making 0.001% interest is bordering on irresponsible.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:50:39
I would use an ok GPU to mine some altcoins and then trade them for BTC. you can start with like a 50$ used AMD card and build up from there. I mine close to $400 in BTC per month with just 2 GPUs (GTX 1080TI and 1070). 
You can use this calculator to get an idea of what the return from some popular GPUs could look like: 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:35:35
What's wrong with a little profit taking on a spike. I soled for 3k last night and now I bought back the same amount I sold and made around 400$ per btc, not too bad and my final btc balance is unchanged.
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:03:38
its the same 0.25% when you buy (trade) BTC for USD or USD for BTC
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:34:29
lol UTINNI  UTINNI!! Filthy creatures 
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:19:29
yup, once the money clears you can take the coins out and send them wherever you want. they also let you trade immediately with up to 500$ per day of deposit money which is awesome 
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:55:48
may i ask why are you 100% invested in BTC and not a bit diversified?
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:23:59
yeah each wallet can be re-scanned like this and 4/5 times that fixes any ambiguity you see. Also, unrelated: tonight at 10PM PST Exodus will release an update, and i'm like 80% sure they will include support for DCR, fingers crossed
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:03:58
DUDE! ETH and  zCash, shit mines on most GPUs over 2gigs or VRAM and its still very profitable. I have a 1080TI and a 1070 which i bought with 6 weeks mining profit from the 1080TI
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:41:35
Hodl on tight, its a wild ride
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:47:11
Its a low cost and accessible way to day trad with no need for 5 figure minimum account balances like on some NYSE brokerages. you can even do it anonymously if your deliberate about it. you could get into it with $5 if thats all you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:56:38
You think so? i feel like there will always be ups and downs to make profitable trades on, i'm expecting the overall volatility to drop a bit in the future, so maybe instead of pulling a nice 10% move over night i could pull a 5% move over the course of a month or so. Or do you think there will come a time when the value only moves up without correction?
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:53:03
Lol they never got back to me,  I just moved to gemini
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:39:39
i like Poloniex of low volume trades and shapeshift for large trades. I makes sense to use polo if your trading low volumes so that your not slammed with mining and network fees on each trade. but of course doing what you are most comfortable with is key. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:37:12
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:11:09
absolutely you should not get in trouble. 
If the exodus balance is still 2x what you expected in a few hours and your Copay Balance is still cleared out you would be a good Samaritan to make Copay aware of the issue so they can rectify the root of the problem on their end before other users funds are affected. they should appreciate you making them aware of a flaw rather than exploiting it in silence. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:17:17
also in Exodus when your on your BTC wallet mouse over the BTC logo and "rescan" or "refresh" the wallet. this might update your balance and fix your issue. also closing and reopening the Exodus wallet will do this
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:54:02
I think low denomination trades like that are best kept on an exchange where the fees are much lower. for 20$ worth i would not use shapeshift, youll end up paying a large portion of the trade in mining fees and on the spread.
for example if im gonna trade BTC for ETH now on Shapeshift look at this:
0.01BTC ---&gt; 0.0769ETH
0.1BTC ----&gt;  0.8342ETH
1BTC ---&gt;  8.3842ETH
See that this is all the same time but im getting almost 9% more ETH for BTC in the higher denominations. on an exchange like Poloniex that fee is always .25% no matter the amount. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:52:53
Very cool thank you,  so now when I get home I'll see it in my wallet and it will show the wallet address it came from so I cam try sending it back the same way?
also there must be some fractional fee involved with transactions to incentives miners right? well I guess I'll see tonight.  Thanks a lot, you saved me the hassle of having to put a lot of private contact info into an exchange just to get a few cents of bitcoin.   
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:08:01
I use Gemini, buy with my bank account so basically my debit card but there is no hold on funds, you can trade with up to $500 of deposited money instantly. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:50:19
oh yeah its odd, some times the price data on my exodus wiggs out an displays a value for Dogecoin which makes my wallet worth many millions of USD, but its just an error in the pricing display from cryptocompare
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:57:32
My 1080TI is under-clocked so its not too loud or hot in my hot room, but i hash Libry at .430GH/s and Equihash (ether and zCash) at around 625Sol/s all while keeping a core temp of like 64C. I stopped pool mining since i want BTC not the coins i'm mining so i started using NiceHash to sell the hash power directly for BTC, its a bit less profitable at times but i don't care because its so convenient. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:31:44
lol not really, each exchange exists more or less independent of the others. why do you think arbitrage opportunities exist for so long. That, and there is no closing price for the market so what would coinbase be manipulating.
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:20:24
sure, I bought an HP z420 used for about $425 so that came with a Intel Xeon CPU E5-1650 6core, 12 threads at 3.2GHz and 32 Gigs of RAM. I put in a 500gig SSD and a 4TB HDD for about $100 each, then i added an EVGA GTX 1080TI GPU for about $700. 
I mine with the GPU, and stake from the SSD
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:28:42
The main difference between the 2 options is that when your coins are in Exodus and you use Shapeshift, the coins are only out of your control while the transaction is taking place. also you do not need any identification to use exodus or shapeshift.
on poloniex they hold all your funds and you are trusting them to relinquish that control should you want to withdraw. because they are holding all your funds your basically buying credit of the currencies you are trading, those currencies don't actually move around on their respective blaockchains as a result of trading on polo untill your withdraw. on shapeshift they do each trade, that's why the fees are so much lower on polo. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:00:30
sounds like an error updating your balance display in Copay to me. if not try and send it to exodus again and see if it lets you double your money lol if so the network will correct the double spend within a few minutes of hours. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 01:59:16
not right, the price of BTC is not a product of the transactions taking place on the network. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:11:57
are they not the same thing ?
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:13:42
if it splits there is still a finite amount, there is just a potential for 2 chains. look at ETH and ETC that was once the same thing. If you hold BTC in your own wallet before the split you'll have the coins on both chains, and both chains will still be limited to about 21 million coins as far as i know. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:29:09
HOLY CRAP! they still make a print version of this paper?
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:42:00
Scroll down and look at the links in the column on the Right side of this Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:26:21
I actually think many people mine with their GPU through NiceHash and do in fact receive BTC for their GPU mining
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:00:59
Oh got it, because the Reddit monkey loves his bananas. is it a screen print or a digital print? its definitely weird and merits a double take.

BTC is international, do you know how far $200 goes in some places?
