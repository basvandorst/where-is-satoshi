They are until they're not.  Just recognize manipulation for what it is.

This is why I suffer cognitive dissonance when it comes to Bitcoin.  I understand that it costs more to make a Bitcoin than it does a paper dollar but what is that worth to Joe Public?  They don't really care about the technology behind it, just that they should be able to use it.  
If the value goes up due to mass adoption, is something that takes a shit ton of electricity to produce, has no recourse for mistakenly sent or stolen coins and is (currently) unregulated and suceptible to manipulation as valuable as it is?  Also, is no one else thinking about what effect using all that electricity will have on our bills?  [There are literally small countries that use less electricity than Bitcoin mining does worldwide.]( As far as I can tell, for most people getting into it, the only value it has is that it seems to miraculously increase in value because people keep buying it.  Nobody new knows or cares about hashpower.
There's going to have to be a new currency anyway, now that crypto is becoming mainstream.  JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are in?  Mainstream is not cryptic and defeats the whole zeitgeist if you ask me.  It wouldn't surprise me if in the future there would be a way to literally think currency into existence.

Inflation sucks eggs but it's a reality.  Something that appreciates in value ad infinitum isn't sustainable.  At the end of the day there needs to be a stable currency that doesn't drastically affect your net worth it you decide not to trade it for a few months.  Bitcoin, as we've seen in 2018 is not that.

The currency used to buy Bitcoin is fiat currency.  Are there any currencies backed by a silver or gold standard anymore?  If there are, they aren't the ones used to purchase Bitcoin in the first place.  That is how it is valued.  Yes, you can say it takes x amount hours and electricity to produce it, but a currency's value depends on what widespread opinion of it is.  If general concensus is that it's worthless it'll be just that, regardless of the limited supply.  Furthermore, there are faster cheaper, truly anonymous and fungible coins out there that outperform Bitcoin and won't have to say they're a "store of value" when people complain about ridiculous transer times and fees.

If you bought in any time after December 18th I'd argue that it is not a darn good store of value.  They only started calling it a store of value when the times and fees got out of hand.  I'm not saying there's no value to Bitcoin, I've used it to purchase goods and services at times but it's not the paragon in my view.  *Edit: it was the genesis of crypto so it gets respect for that but beyond that, it does have competition.*You can buy Bitcoin by trading your stamp collection with someone who wants that stamp collection if you really want to but that's not what most people are using, they use fiat currency.

What is it that you think people are using to buy Bitcoin?
