Thanks for sending...just checked it out.
The receiving end was very simple and I dont think you can make that any easier for those getting bitcoin. 
My only feedback would be to include (underneath the current email you recieve) some instructions or tips on how to set up your own wallet with a seed you can own, maybe with links to a wallet app in Android and iOS, or a link to a video with an introduction to bitcoin by Andreas to allow people to start educating themself about the bitcoin they now own.
Will check out the send side and get back with feedback on that.

Does the recipient receive the bitcoin in a custodial account/wallet, or is there a mechanism through which the recipient can generate and securely receive wallet keys, or does the recipient need to provide an bitcoin address once they get the email? (or maybe none of the above?)

Thanks for the clarification. Will give it a test run.

Your doing this all wrong. 
Satoshis.place FTW

Highly recommend getting a hardware wallet. Trezors are $100 and are so simple. Not your keys, not your coins.

For those not running their own lightning node, there are several projects/apps that already facilitate adding capacity to the lightning network. l have been using Eclair wallet (by ACINQ) to transfer bitcoin from the blockchain "mainnet" to the lightning network by opening payment channels, and using them to spedn on lighning services like satoshis.place or lightningspin.com
I don't know if this falls under "online" wallets...but I'd encourage you to throw a few satoshis in and play around. I'm not technical enough to risk a mainnet mode myself but have learned a lot and been amazed just by interacting and requesting/fulfilling payment requests.
Here's a great list of lightning spednable spots:

1) Run a full node!  ...i have no technical background and used a 5 year old computer to do this in a few hours. Critical to long term security, sustainability and reliability which surely affects the price.
2) Besides investment, use/spending of bitcoin also helps the ecosystem grow, proves many of the use cases behind its design, and helps developers continue to innovate. The stats we read about lightning network growth also will have an effect, though more marginal on a day to day basis,  when long term improvements are realized it makes the whole ecosystem more valuable
