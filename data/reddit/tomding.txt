In a DApp or DAC, the token functions with dual properties of currency AND shares, because each token represent a % of total outstanding. The profit of a DAC/Dapp could come from for example a cut of each transaction -- like BitShares X did, and rewarded back to the token holder. So as network gets more popular, the network gets more profitable for its "shareholders". Therefore the incentive to hold them is for value appreciation. The argument saying that people wouldn't hold AppCoins (or for shorter and shorter time) is like saying no VC or founder want to hold shares in a startup because USD is much more liquid.

The course will be about 3 - 5 hours on every Saturday, usually 3 hours of course and a few hours of group practice / hacking.
We'll be taking applications soon, but in general we're open to any bright developers with real world development experience and strong grasp of one or more languages and computer science fundamentals, but cryptography or cryptocurrency or fintech background is not required (though a huge plus obviously).
