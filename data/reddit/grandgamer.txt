It will take time though. I don't think Brexit will happen now. I think there will be another referendum in a year or so.

I saw those two as well but I need confirmation of legitimacy first. They may be scam websites as far as I'm concerned.

Here's the thing, I live in Greece and atm we can't use PayPal for purchases online due to capital controls. The only way to do it is by using a foreign Debit/Credit Card. So I thought, maybe there is a way to fill your PayPal Balance through bitcoin instead. BTC is great and all but the websites and services that accept it are limited.

And depending on how Vulkan goes and Valve's campaign, Windows may actually lose market share.
@_date: 2015-08-02 18:18:28
You can plug it in to a new computer as an external drive and try to recover your files, or use a Linux LiveCD to do it and just re-install fresh Windows from scratch.

Yep. Stay away from Windows 10 with wallet clients as Microsoft has access to **all** your files and folders.
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:56:24
The majority of the world is not using Windows 10 yet. It's also not BTC's fault if Microsoft is a failure as a company and makes trash OSes and it's our failure for using Windows and we should stop.

I meant something like a website where I can pay in BitCoin to fill my PayPal balance. Something other than trading with individuals. And by confirmed I mean something tested, that is not a scam.
@_date: 2015-07-25 09:02:00
There is also し actually :P
@_date: 2015-07-24 18:22:05
That's actually much better cause it also looks like a coin. But yeah it's harder to type and people will think it's a smiley.

True but also not so true. Katakana is used as a phonetic, how you pronounce things, not as a letter. It is used to show how Kanji are pronounced, so it's pretty close to Kanji as well.
You are right that it could create confusion, but Katakana is not very commonly used. It needs to be next to a foreign word to create confusion e.g. ハンバーガーシ500,0000 (hamburger 5,000,000 satoshi), which is possible. I would rather use a Kanji instead or a variation of the Bitcoin symbol.

~~Because Cyprus isn't part of the Eurozone, they have their own currency.~~
EDIT: My bad, check below.

There is no "si" in Japanese only "shi".

Let me get this straight.
1) It works like a wallet on Mobile Phones and you can use your bitcoins to make payments on NFC terminals?
2) Can you do it on any and all NFC terminals?
3) Can I use it to pay in Euro directly or is it only for BTC payments?
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:32:43
Nice! Keep up the good work OP.
@_date: 2015-07-27 07:44:09
I think this belongs in but I guess it would be too long.

What happens if you don't give him the key?
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:06:53
It's not worth it because you probably will make less than what it will cost you. It is actually anonymous but the transaction is visible to everyone, I think. I'd better let the experts explain instead.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:38:12
True, although I believe the "Share Porn" part does the trick.
@_date: 2015-07-31 13:31:28
I doubt many people will read the EULA.

There are a few dice sites that give you a few BTC through a faucet and you can use that to play instead of investing your BTC.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:48:25
There's a very nice forum called bitcointalk.org, where sites are advertised and also critisized(for scamming etc) by users. You can check it out if you want to check if a site is trustworthy.
@_date: 2015-07-31 15:47:14
Can we ban banning?

Oh yeah they switched in 2008. My bad. The thing is, Cyprus doesn't have a debt double the size their GDP. People will possibly search for alternative currency because there are rumours that Greece will be kicked out of the Eurozone.
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:34:47
One correction, it's "shi" not "si".
That's not a bad idea but people would have to install a Japanese input to type it or modify their current keyboard layout to include it.
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:44:46
It could be if you write it in a phrase with foreign words before the number, but how probable is that? Commonly, Japanese use the Kanji for yen in texts, not the currency symbol. However the Kanji goes after the number not before.
I feel like we should have some variation of the bitcoin symbol instead.

Does that mean it works in US only for the moment?
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:33:20
Italy is fine for the moment. Let me show you something: [Greek Debt]( [Italian Debt](
Here's what's happening. This is all a big politics game. EU is trying to force Greece into austerity, which will make repaying debts faster but will also doom the country to a very bad economic position in the future. More and more people will leave the country to find something better. What can be done? debt haircut. At the moment we are effectively paying Interest without repaying the debt. Are they doing it? no, because they want to control us economically(at least that's what they seem to want).
Italy's fate depends on what the EU decides for Greece on Monday. That's something that many people don't understand. If Greece is kicked out of the Eurozone, the Euro as a currency may be stabilized, but it will lose value. At that point everything will be worse for Italy and a couple of other countries like [Portugal]( They will basically be doomed to reach the state Greece is in, with a massive debt or extreme measures. That will destabilize the Euro as a currency again.
It is all very complicated and we are about to see very important events for the EU. What will happen? we'll see soon™
@_date: 2015-07-05 02:56:23
Pandemonium will ensue with a "No" vote anyway, but not in Greece. It's politics all around the world that will go in a rampage of discussions. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:18:52
Nice. Here's another question:
Will there be a way to use the balance on my wallet in OneBit, to pay for online services? I mean services like paying online shops that do not accept BTC.
