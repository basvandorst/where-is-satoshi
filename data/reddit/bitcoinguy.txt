Those two are not mutually exclusive. However, having a (optional) central counterparty to transactions is advantageous for compliance and process efficiency. 
Ideally folks would be able to deposit directly into Central Bank reserves in the form of interest earning bitcoin-denominated accounts.

This seems like spam but if you see relevance here it would be great to hear your thoughts.

This sounds a bit delusional and non-nuanced. I recommend doing some reading on how capital markets work.

That's actually exactly how cash was popularized. Gold smiths would issue IOU notes on gold deposits that were actively used as cash. However, there was not always enough gold in vaults to back up notes in circulation. In essence, gold-denominated debt was created.

Average debtors will likely opt to work with regulated institutions, short of there being a meaningful spread between rates offered by regulated institutions and non-regulated institutions.

Nope, in their office.

It also sounds like you didn't actually read the intro. The proposal is for a fiduciary currency, not a fiat currency.
The state is nothing but the culmination of many moving parts. It's an abstraction we use to simplify and 'understand' how markets and politics play out at scale.

Even if there were negative interest rates?

Exchange rate pegs are actually less burdensome under a bitcoin standard. I recommend reading up the Classical Gold Standard Era to learn a bit more about exchange rate dynamics in a global system utilizing a common value standard.

The gold standard was abandoned due to war-fueled unsustainable debt being taken out by nation-states operating under it.

That's required of any loan legally issued by an institution licensed to issue loans in the US as far as I'm aware of, regardless of counterparty.

Those two big wars mid 20th century were called world wars for a reason.
Not to mention, many microstates also maintain dependencies on larger nation-states and peg their currency value to these nation-states' currencies regardless.

If you're currently holding fiat currency the advantage would be a better rate of return on capital over time as a result of bitcoin's deflation and competitive interest rates on fiduciary currency-denominated debt.
If you're currently holding bitcoin the advantage would be the ability to receive interest on bitcoin by exchanging it for bitcoin-backed fiduciary currency and lending out that fiduciary currency via money markets and hopefully P2P markets.

You do realize not every nation-state was on the gold standard, right? Few nation-states that were not one the major imperial powers even had economies of somewhat global significance.
Also for reference, the gold standard used as a model for a bitcoin standard existed solely under the Classical Gold Standard Era of 1870-1920. War-fueled reserve depletion led to nation-states abandoning the classical standard for quasi-standards which enabled war-fueled money and debt printing to continue.

Fair point. However, risk management becomes particularly challenging on loans issued in a unregulated manner. This tends to lead to predatory practices (e.g. loan sharks).

By definition these bitcoin-backed fiduciary currencies would be backed by cryptography as a result of being backed by bitcoin and utilizing a second layer technology cryptographically anchored to the bitcoin blockchain (e.g. colored coins).

It sounds like most of your understanding of Central Bank and CBers comes from the internet and online forums. Central Banks' objectives are monetary system stability and growth. There are perhaps certain individuals within CBs with less socially-minded goals, but nonetheless as an institution those are the guiding objectives.

Inflation is a major problem to most savers in the world. Enabling savers to maintain purchasing power over time while simultaneously enabling economic growth comparable to today is a notion I've received interest in, directly from Central Bankers.
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:24:41
It's worth noting that Central Banks are not normal banks. I recommend doing some reading up on how the system actually works.
USD is what gains or loses purchasing power, largely as a result of monetary and fiscal policy.
@_date: 2018-03-04 05:16:37
Sound money.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:02:42
Central Bank tool set is actually limited to monetary policy (sadly the golden rod of inflation control has been out of service since '86 or so /s).

There should be a certain ratio of reserves to lent capital that should in theory protect against this kind of failure, calculated using historical demand for credit in times of financial crisis. 
I will include any relevant calculations I find that address this in the paper as well.

Damn, you sound miserable lol.

Alas, it makes more sense than this comment. Care to explain?

Compliance overhead associated with fine combing KYC/AML for every individual counterparty is meaningful.
Process associated with managing counterparty risk for every bilateral credit relationship is generally complex and relatively high risk for end creditors at anything less than large institutional scale. Microloans are a potential exception but this is a largely underdeveloped market.
In regards to 2008, I recommend you write your local central banker to quit and join a hedge fund if that's how they want to run the fed. That is larger issue that will occur under any monetary system. At least under a bitcoin standard purchasing power of savers stands a chance at being maintained.

Another just for reference, but the Treasury technically prints new fiat. Central Bank/The Fed is responsible for new debt issuance.
Also, Central Banks don't have the legal authority to declare war or carry out violence. That would be Congress and law enforcement in the US.
@_date: 2018-03-04 03:30:19
I have actually discussed this with Central Bankers yet some random person on the internet feels entitled enough to dismiss it with no specificity. Lol.
