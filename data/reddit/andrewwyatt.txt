If you want to start just go for it because there’s never too late for anything. But you just have to start with the latest mining rigs.

It’s great to see if a local computer store accepts Bitcoin. It'll really help the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Convert them into another digital currency before August 1, in a case of chain split happens on 1st of August you can come back and again convert them into BTC.

Bitcoin community is searching for the best solution for the scaling problem. SegWit seems the best solution which may cause speedy transactions. SegWit requires about 95% of miner’s approval. Bitcoin community agreed on a solution BIP148. This may have User-Activated Soft Fork, which forces the blockchain to split through rejecting any blocks of bitcoin that do not show their support for SegWit. BIP148 will be in action on 1 August and in a case, if developers did not agree on this suggestion, blockchain can split.
