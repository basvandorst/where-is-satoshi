You're missing my point. It would be great if everyone would stand up. My point is that if you want to find out how many people are courageous, there's a [selection bias] ( here when you're only looking at successful companies. Here's an example of what I mean. Lets say that out of 100 start up companies 90 of them do the right thing and resist unconstitutional government orders, and 10 of them comply. Then the government financially ruins those 90 companies, leaving only the 10 that complied, which go on to be popular and successful businesses. As the public we would only ever know about those 10 that survived, which would make it seem like everyone is cowardly, when actually most companies did the right thing at the cost of their existence. We can't know how common courage is just by looking at the survivors, because in this case courage eliminates itself. 
So my point is more about the bayesian difference between a prior and a posterior.

That's the wrong way of looking at it. If today 50% of tech companies resisted government orders, then tomorrow 0% of tech companies will resist government orders, because those that do will be driven out of business. Courage isn't necessarily rare. It just selects itself out of the gene pool. 
The fact that we have so many companies that comply with the government is not an indictment on people in general, but rather on the immense power of our security agencies.
