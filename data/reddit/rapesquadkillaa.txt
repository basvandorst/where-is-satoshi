Yeah, same here. It really sucks :/
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:33:16
True, I'm not selling.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:00:24
What a safe place to keep alt coins?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:04:57
What exchange would you recommend instead?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:38
I was just about to sell at 19k and then gdax crashed, not happy lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:04:08
That doesn't even make sense, you're going to trade BTC for BTC? Trading BTC for anything else is a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:45
Same here :/
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:13:53
As long as you bought the dip you were!
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:04:27
Yeah that's what I figured, thanks though!
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:33:12
Sure thing, just send it to my PayPal first and I'll make sure it gets to you.

I bought in at $7200 sold at $6900 and then bought back in at $6000 and then just sold a bit for $12500. Do I get to subtract my loss from the gains I made?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:30:26
Yes it would be stupid, but that's what the new tax bill says.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:09:41
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:40:52
I stand to gain more if I buy in if Bitcoin dips to $2000 but just because I want to buy it at $2000 doesn't mean it's going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:12:35
Interesting, so is this crazy high run up an indicator of the end of the bull run would you say?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:56:38
Me too! Just wish it was more than only $100 worth. Who knew I would actually have good timing for once.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:36:00
Why will it skyrocket after the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:31:49
Unfortunately not but i use just use it in my browser on my phone and it works well

Open a Coinbase account, link it to your bank account and then transfer the money to Coinbase (it'll take about a week) then transfer the money to gdax which is a sister company to Coinbase with much lower fees.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:45:44
How do you transfer from Coinbase to Gdax? What does not leaving on the exchange mean? I was looking into buying some Bitcoin when it was in the $3ks last month and now I'm kicking myself.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:01:22
What do you have to do with your BTC? How do you protect them?
