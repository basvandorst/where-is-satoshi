Key word is potential. He’s seen incredible tech come about throughout his lifetime, and I’m sure he thinks it’s amazing. He’s an investor though, and tech companies don’t tend to really make much money for a very long time. 
His method of value investing is to invest in companies you know will make money since they have a track record of doing it, not throwing tons of money at a company because it has potential.

Totally, you should just stuff it all under your mattress, much safer there!

He's not right on everything, but he's been more right than almost all traders and investors in the past. 


A lot of people during the Dot Com bubble would argue that. Hind-sight is incredibly 20/20...
I'm not saying that there is a guaranteed path to success, but writing Buffet off and saying what has worked in the past won't work in the future is tunnel visioned.

Considering he's one of, if not the most successful investors of all time, it's a bit crazy to think any one on here knows more than him about how to make money through investments. 
Warren Buffet has seen many "Bitcoins" in the past, and sure, maybe this time it might be different, but brushing off anything he says probably isn't the best idea...

If you're talking about when they said they would no longer accept certain bills, than that scenarios is rare and most likely won't happen a again.

Than what's the point of it? A currency is supposed to be spent, not invested into. Bitcoin is becoming less of a currency by the day, and becoming more of a volatile equity.

Why? What’s its value based upon? Stocks and bonds have underlying assets, Bitcoin is the asset, so you are basically buying an asset that goes up and down on price based solely on what value people put on it. 
The vast majority of Wall Street won’t touch this with a 10 foot poll, it’s far too volatile for them since most investors don’t want their money in something that has historically done a 180 and shot down in price as quickly as it shot up.

Maybe some are, but the vast majority hold value, blue chip stocks. People who invest aren't looking to gamble their money, which is what buying volatile stocks is.

It has potential, but if I recall, everything back when the .com bubble burst had potential to rocket towards success. 
Economics tends to stay on trends over time, and it’s not like Bitcoin is the first thing in history that is “the future”, it’s just this current moment’s future.

Like the dollar? It's a fiat currency, yet it doesn't shoot up in value like Bitcoin, because if it did, it would be called hyperinflation. If people truly want to use Bitcoin as a currency, than this volatility and inflation isn't good. How can you price something in Bitcoin if during a single day it could fluctuate as much as it does? 
$100 billion pledged over how long? And is it in writing? Both of those make a huge difference in building into Wall Street touching it.  
If you really want to gamble, buy ETFs for Bitcoin when they come.

They might have a %, but a small one. Historically, blue chips have outperformed volatile stocks, which is why Buffet has preached it for decades. You can have a balanced portfolio without volatile stocks.

Bitcoin being a fiat currency is where I think the problem is. If any other currency was shooting up as much as Bitcoin is, it would be considered hyperinflation, so why is Bitcoin different?

We seem to be going the opposite direction of adopting it. The skyrocket in price is going to hurt it, and it already has. Retailers that are stopping accepting it isn't good. 


That should be concerning then if prices are going up because Wall Street is involved. They constantly pump hot stocks they know people will invest in blindly, recently Snap Chat.  


Not all ETFs are good, take a look at ones involving Gold. It's gambling.
