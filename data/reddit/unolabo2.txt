The futures market is closer to the end of the re-opening period, it always delays the flow of funds (the end of the financial year, the quarter of the quarter, and the end of the half-year are not far off). But closer to the same period, large-scale laundering of money begins, and most of them now pass through the crypto-currencies, which means that the bitcoin's shaft capacity will only increase

Context - this is what a person says during a conversation about something else, and what he himself was defining the meaning of these specific words, this explains why there is no video and audio, since the conversation itself was about another

Unfortunately, this market is influenced by news from specific people (such as Vitalik Butyrin), who often act in their own interests or the interests of individuals. without government regulation, this market is very unstable, which causes strong jumps in the rate.

Full inclusion by default, will not be possible for a long time, because of the general changes, who would not say something about this

Yes, but these guys do not like to just risk so much, and until the new year such investments are a pure risk, because the boundaries of volatility crypto currency are greatly eroded, and the amplitude of the jumps only increases

In my opinion, to work now with bitcoin, you need to wait until tonight and see the curves of the fall and the main news and wait, further, or make a purchase transaction (if today is the boundary of the fall, or wait)

But the question is that the volatility of the currency is now very high, falling by more than 10% in the main currency of the channel, should not be

I'm not sure, in my opinion, the market is overheated now, plus there are a lot of ICO-scams on the market, so the limit of the BTC is $ 7000-8000, and then state regulation will follow. In my opinion, from ISO only freelance exchanges, such as unanolo can survive such jumps, but even about them I'm not sure

Bitcoin is an extremely risky investment product because of its high volatility, can you imagine price fluctuations in any other market at 30-40% per quarter?

I have been engaged in stock trading for 8 years already, and I understand something about this
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:02:25


You are wrong, in my opinion the limit bitcoin - $ 9000, further growth will stop the state regulation
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:13:18


In my opinion, it is dangerous to trade with the bitcoin until the evening, its median of the market movement is not quite clear, and given that it has broken through the volatility corridor, it is possible for a further fall or rapid extinctional growth
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:25:37
Because by this time, the corridor of volatility will once again be punched, given the overall amplitude of the price fluctuation, the question is only where it will be punched up or down
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:46:07


I'm not saying that it will not be higher, in my opinion the limit is somewhere around $ 9000, then there will be state regulation, and the rate will drop to $ 5000 -6000 $, and at this level it will fluctuate
