My friend, you missed my point. I did not say there should be centralisation. I would like a spearheading on the bitcoin community to make information available without impacting centralisation.
also the problems being rapidly reported and detected is essentially the debugging that portico users need to do but don't. foundation cannot pronounce that enough yet its nowhere near the front page. that is the type of spearheading I'm talking obout. it benefits everyone in long torm. but users are just abusing bitcoin for short term financial gain rather than seeing long term potential. therefore once again spearheading the movement, not a control of power, decentralisation should still be paramount

The thing is, karpeles is the face of it. however he alone cannot keep it afloat. there are others who use gox as arbitrage who can afford to roll some profits to gox team. therefore as long as there are people who want to make quick profits off bitcoin will keep gox on life support.
anyways thats my tin foil hat take.

I don't want to spam r/bitcoin with a whole new thread so hopefully you can answer this for me if you have some spare time. please and thank you.
Why is it such a pain in the ass to actually buy btc/ltc/doge. BTC-e won't accept deposit apart from like 5 sites. so i signed up to perfect money. Bank transfer is 300$ minimum, I am no thrown my money into something i signed up for 5 mins ago, I am already throwing it away onto digital coins. They won't accept paypal, the only way is through another merchant which also takes a cut. so before I can by anything 2 cuts will be made...
For me this is whats making it tedious and boring. There need to be a standardisation of crypto currency exchange and obviously i can't have it a snap of my fingers as it is in its infancy still. 
So is there a non tedious normal way of jus depositing money via paypal or a small value bank transfer where I can purchase some btw/ltc/doge without getting cut more than twice and relatively quickly, say in completing all pain in the ass transactions from me in say like an hour or something?
I may be having a rant, but not at you, this was just looooong. Once again I appreciate all the help that you can give me. thank in advance

even on bitcoin scale this isn't too big to fail. people had news prior to gox crash and got their money out.  then all the speculators got in and thats what drove the volume. in real terms id say it had less then 5 % of btw community in it. Government wouldn't even bail out that piece of shit.
funnily  enough in japan cel can't resign without having a appointed a successor as a CEO. we might see a rebranding and another piece of shit exchange come out of it. However it still has obligations to tender to. So unless theres a huge financial backer, not likely

the this is the thing. its hard to explain to people outside the bitcoin loop why it doesn't need it. how the age old byzantine generals problem was solved by satoshi.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:51:43
the thing is, btc is not the concept of a car, it is an actual car manufacturer.  the distributed proof of ownership i.e. the public ledger is what will not go away. therefore there are many cars out there, like cryptos. It is not necessarily that btc will make it. I believe a crypt will definitely be up there but I am not certain that it will be btc.
All it takes is one/anonymous passionate programmer/s, to change the world. it can happen again, and it may or may not be btc

[I dont even know what that meants](
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:08:36
I agreed with you. people take too far the sole idea of decentralisation. decentralisation of authority has been achieved. However decentralisation has affected the community. Someone lambasted me because I said Satoshi would be more useful in stabilising the markets by asserting his assurance in the bitcoin protocol. I got criticised because it against decentralisation. I am not saying he controls or security back bitcoin but be its PR figurehead and bring out figureheads from bitcoin foundation (So they can contribute to PR in more way than complainingg that companies don't debug etc.) 
Would that not help decrease volatility and increase liquidity pools if there was a reliable source of information. The argument is how can we rely on one/two sources of information, they may mislead us to their own ends. However total decentralisation just leaves us in a cloud of ambiguity. we don't have a set of problems to solve that will let us know that the information were receiving is true.
Edit: I dont understand why everyone thinks I'm arguing against open source. My english may be misleading once again. I am saying spearheading does not have to be centralised. decentralisation is key and paramount, however it needs direction
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:54:46

@_date: 2014-05-06 05:41:18
not sure about 2. and 3. but the rest all prett big factors some of which i haven't even thought of. 
There are a lot of wanna be bag holders waiting to buy in after the downward trend is over though. 
However, I feel for btc to reach the next all time high, confirmation time needs to be reduced and some sort of specific regulation put in place to stop the ambiguity that keeps putting a shadow over the cryptoworld.

Ohhhhh you make so much sense and I understand that part a lot better now, thank you for your help! Reddit is fascinating and you a kind person to take your time to writ sit out for me.
I am in the UK, but it seems easier to transfer via paypal straight to USD as there doesn't seem to be many £ exchanges around, or at least ones that I can find. The thread I read about chargebacks also makes a lot of sense now.
I guess this is the whole problem of crypto currencies at the moment. I think most people are just hoarding to make profit when the coins get more established. However if no one wants to use them but only to profit from them how are they to be more widely used. Having a few coins and being to use them freely here and there on the internet would be quite in the future. Irreversible nature of it , which i didn't really get until you explained it, is pretty hard to establish if no one trusts each other. Im sure someone will find a solution though.

Nice write up thanks, I literally had this explained to me yesterday. you could have included the interesting thing about how satoshi used sha256 for private keys but ripemd160 for addresses which doesn't make sense. we also worked out that a collision rate for keys to addresses is 1 per 4months if you have (can't remember how much ) a lot of power of the btc network. i.e. you keys can be discovered(brute forced) but it is so long that you make more money just by mining than not really knowing how much money is in a particular address. to scale that the second biggest address, the  FBI one, has 100m yet you would make around $400m mining with the amount of computational power you would need in the same time, so theres no point in cracking private keys with this little computational power.
However, wait for quantum computing, then we might have a security problem.
