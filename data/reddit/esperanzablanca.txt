it is plausible or not? did they not enter a foreign soreveign state to kill somebody ? they dont have secret jails ? whatever I can imagine, the CIA already thought about it

food and water have a real value, you need it or you die, there are things that arent worthless no matter what
just last week I had 3 days without electricity in my country (thanks Macri) and I wondered what will happen with bitcoin when the 3rd nuclear war with best korea starts and we end without electricity, I know you can transact in paper but seems little practical and useless in a post nuclear war scenario

wtf? Im just asking a legit question... it is true or not ? does the USA goverment holds lots of coins ? the majority of coins are controlled by a few whales ? look what happened to Ghadaffi when he proposed to ditch the worthless dollars, and ask gold for oil instead, where he is now? 
Im asking a legit question because I dont want dollars, they are toilet paper, and when the world realizes it, shit is going to hit the fan in big way. USA does not like that you propose to stop taking their worthless green toilet paper
Gadhafi's Gold-money Plan Would Have Devastated Dollar, and BTC will devastate the worthless dollar and their shitty banks too.

Cryptojacking, which exploded in popularity this fall, has an ostensibly worthy goal: Use an untapped resource to create an alternative revenue stream for games or media sites, and reduce reliance on ads. It works by embedding a JavaScript component in a website that can leverage a visiting device's processing power to mine a cryptocurrency (usually Monero). 
I think uBlock origin blocks this behaviour per default, but I may be wrong...
BTW I dont mind if a site that I find useful ask me to mine some time while I browse them, while they clearly states what they are doing. Instead of running automatically and invisibly, AuthedMine takes the novel step of actually asking permission to run.

What if the whales dump it?
I know the CIA or FBI holds lots of BTC...
USA has crushed anything that could pose a threat to their world hegemony. If btc menaces the dollar worth, they will find a way to try to destroy it or its value. Just look at the historic facts. Probably the CIA already has a plan to deal with it and all. They have hypothesis of conflict for everything you can imagine. 
I mean, there are some wallets that really have lots of btc, they could easily crash the price if they sell... and some of those are government controlled wallets from seized assets (i.e silk road)
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:58:09
this is 2 thousand btc or just 2 point something ? if 2 thousand, sorry for your loss, if is just 2 something, suck it up, is just pocket money
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:00:23
They have tracked down and kidnaped or killed lots of individuals in their years of operations, and black operations, they could do it, is not like Im basing on some sort of fiction. 
they kidnapped a 12 year old girl, why they would shy of kidnapping some middle aged men to comply their objetives?

I think USA and or the CIA will do something to destroy bitcoin when their worthless dollars finally fall down. Like they did with Ghadaffi and his gold backed money and plan to ditch the paper worthless dollar. What do you think? 
The CIA has lots of btc stashed, they could sell for very low price and make it crash. They could even kidnap Satoshi and the other whales and force them to sell low. They entered a soreveign country to kill Osama, they could get to Satoshi anywhere in the world. Just one of the plans I can think. They probably have a hundred plans to crash btc that I can't even think, they have a army of smart people and resources to resolve this kind of problems.

I did this same question yesterday thinking about this : 








They destroyed Ghadaffi when he tried to replace the dollar by a gold backed currency, when BTC starts to destroy the worthless dollar, they will probably do something too
Gadhafi's Gold-money Plan Would Have Devastated Dollar, and BTC will devastate the worthless dollar and their shitty banks too.

I think is a insane price and should be way lower to make btc useful in the original spirit of the creation. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:12:32
I would have some foreign money, gold, diamonds, stocks, bonds and bullets on my portfolio too. Too much crypto and nothing of the other stuff in yours. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:54:44
And how that prevents the CIA from crashing or manipulate the bitcoin price? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:28:18
Let's say the OPEP starts taking btc instead of dollars for oil, what would happen? I'm talking of the future when btc adoption starts to really threaten the worthless fiat currency and the banks...
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:29:53
I don't understand your answer, please reformulate it. Thanks

haha nice meme stolen from argentina, the yerba mate ....
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:21:42
repeat with me : "Im not gonna live forever". It can go to the moon tomorrow, or in 100 years, nobody knows. For today, I want to enjoy life, because tomorrow I may be dead. Thats why tomorrow Im going to be having a piña colada by the beach at undisclosed location in central america, and not looking a silly price on a computer screen. If you're not enjoying life now, waiting for tomorrow... tomorrow you may get cancer and not enjoy life, or get under a bus... spend your money, enjoy life, you will be dead soon

wow 4 people, TOTALLY MASSIVE
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:13:22
is the best way to rip you off of all your life time savings... 
this was the test case, the massive rip off of 2001 in argentina : 
while the banks said "sorry we had no money", airplanes full of cash, gold, etc were taking off the country
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:26:47
I started taking fiat money when my mom stopped paying my groceries and I had to go to purchase my own food... 
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:10:56
if you check worldwide, is simple: if your wealth is in the bank, is not your wealth, is the bank's wealth... they stole all our savings in 2001 in argentina, just with the push of a button, that was the test, they will do it worldwide
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:11:37
google 2001 argentina crisis, and you will undestarnd why is good to have lots of cash and not deal with the banks
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:18:13
I just moved to central america, fuck Uncle Sam. I prefer to not have street lights or good roads, or a army, to pay taxes. I dont like the walled garden that is the EU or EEUU. I hope they keep their cashless society out from here.
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:16:51
I purchased a car in cash like 10 days ago, but Im in central america... I need a golden AK47

This has all to do with AEOI and the ending of bank secrecy (thanks to damn OCDE) and nothing to do with gold. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 07:23:37
just curious
who and why ? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:32:50
Is a hedge against AEOI, that's why...

Argentina money is going to shit too, mega inflation in couple months... the last president was super corrupt and the new one is a incompetent douchebag... 
@_date: 2018-06-28 07:25:06
I lived during the 80s in Argentina, was the same shitty situation. One day you had 1 kg of bread at 1 peso, some time later was 10 000 pesos for 1 kg of bread ... is a really shitty situation
the venezuela situation is so so so so sad, and no exit in sight... I have been to caracas, is not just a distant place to me but a reality
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:03:56


the question is why? never saw a real explanation of why...

I would be tomorrow in the next plane to Costa Rica, never to be seen again. There you can buy a nice penthouse for about 200K USD, beach view and everything...
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:06:43
in May Im moving to my penthouse in Costa Rica, yes, I sold at 2$ ... if you want to join me at the beach on my permanent vacation, let me know, I may invite you some daikiris

You remember when Qaddafi tried to ditch the worthless dollars per oil and instead take gold ? Well, guess what will happen to Maduro after he wants to ditch dollars and instead take crypto per oil barrel ?
