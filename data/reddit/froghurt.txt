Then this problem coming to light could perhaps be an incentive to actually hire some professionals to deal with possible issues that might arise.
If your goal is to convince businesses/new customers that bitcoin actually would be beneficial to them, "we operate with volunteers" isn't really a good catch-phrase.

Rolling out a social network is a relatively easy thing to do, especially with all the infrastructure they already had in place (GMail information, youtube accounts,...). All they needed to do was "some" coding and probably buying a bit more capacity. It was a project that required little investments for a company like google, had a very small chance of  succeeding but could've potentially brought them a lot of revenue. 
They would've been fools to not try it.

Depends on what the investors want. Since they invested in Mt. Gox to begin with, I assume they believe in the future of bitcoin.
Even if an investor wants his money back, it's totally his choice if he's willing to accept let's say 500 BTC in return. Hey he could even choose to just say "nah fuck it". And of course there's also the thing that in case of a bankruptcy, Mt Gox needs to pay off its external debt first before paying back its investors.
 The holders of the *external* debt would never take bitcoin, so in that case it does make sense to liquiditate some assets. Thing is, in case of a bankruptcy this automatically happens and has no impact on them whatsoever. They only get in trouble when someone could prove the bankruptcy was fraudulent, and this seems quite hard.

That was because microsoft had a monopoly back then. Bitcoin can't afford to make the same mistakes Microsoft did. Situations aren't comparable at all.
I don't want bitcoin to fail, but when you know about a problem for 2 years and just take steps to fix it when people start exploiting it, that simply isn't good business.
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:58:59
I agree. " Emerging technology" is a reason for certain bugs, but it surely isnt't an excuse to not fix that bug. This particular vulnerability was known for over 2 years. When mt gox made a statement regarding it, everyone was saying "the real exchanges won't have this issue". But they did. When the major exchanges apparently havent taken the effort to fix a bug they've known about for multiple years, it's not a good thing...
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:52:26
The how and why is easy enough: these attackers know bitcoin deals with a lot of money and seeks to exploit security flaws in the protocol. Same thing happens all the time with banks (phishing etc, which will happen with bitcoin soon). You'll never be able to avoid this. Problem is the bitcoin response to this attack ( DDoS is about the most basic form of attack) wasn't exactly great. I do wonder what'll happen when (not if) attackers start using more sophisticated tools.
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:12:16


1. Those are just the websites of companies that get attacked, usually it takes a couple of hours to repair the damage.
2. Here the actual bitcoin network was attacked and it caused quite a few problems, it wasn't just a website getting defaced.
If bitcoin cannot think of an efficient way to deal with these DDoS attacks then this is a *huge* problem.


Newsflash: the majority of people who use a computer don't know shit about how it works. I agree that's the problem but good luck solving that.

Ok, let me explain:


This really is not the case. Federal reserve cares about the stability of the economy. And I don't believe for a second someone with a degree in economics would consider the theories outdated.


His first job was at a 'macro trading' hedge fund? First, that is rather unlikely. Second, "macro trading" means as much as "trading with big amounts of money" so this essentially means nothing for a hedge fund, but just sounds like buzzwords.


Bull. Shit. This wouldn't change anything at all, except for the point where bitcoin would end up. This would never be an arbitrary parameter set by the researcher, but would be the subject of serious research itself. Not just "oh k I think it'll be 10% of all monetary transactions".


You actually believe the federal reserve would look into bitcoin *now* when a number of firms are already accepting bitcoin as payments? When there already was a massive fraud scandal with Mt Gox? When there's so much money involved with the system? And do you *actually* believe they'd punish the guy for just doing his job?

Hmm, I'm glad it worked out for you but I really don't think that's such a great feature. Maybe it basically serves as a guarantee for Circle that you actually have that money, so it's more of a loan than a direct purchase (meaning the original cash is still in the account). I'd check up on that if I were you, just to make sure you won't get any unexpected costs in the future.
Normally banks simply don't allow direct transfers like that and I really doubt circle would somehow get an exception.

3. Then those exchanges were affected by that same issue, losing their own credibility and blocking withdrawals of bitcoins.
4. The Silk Road owners lost their bitcoins due to hacking. You could claim they just took it, but why the hell would they make up such a story instead of saying "lol we took the money".

I'm terribly sorry for hurting your feelings (yes *that* was sarcastic)


So you believe things like MtGox should continue to be able to happen cause it's the uninformed people who lose money and not you? Personally I think that's rather selfish. You might be an informed economic agent, most people are not.


And you can't see how that system is doomed to fail in the long run? No one would voluntarily help out someone else they don't know cause "it's their own fault". Hey if that's your opinion then fine, but there will come a day when you fuck up and by that point no one will want to help you out. You really believe that sounds like a reasonable way to run a society?


The liberty to invest in shady companies?


They certainly have a right to make their own mistakes, but that does not mean we need to make things harder for them by essentially allowing people to sell them scams. 'Learning from mistakes' usually means them losing a lot of their savings and personally I believe it's unethical to not protect them against that, even if it takes away a portion of their liberty. Plus, you forget about the domino effect. Actions of some uninformed customers can cause informed customers to be affected too.
Though I agree you should be able to opt out of such a system.

Dude, please learn some basic stuff about European economic policy before making absolutely retarded comments like this.
The European Union has an internal market. One of the core aspects of this internal market is free movement of capital. This means that money should be able to flow freely from one country to another country. It has nothing to do with how much money an inhabitant of a country can withdraw per day in order to avoid a bank run.
If Italy would actually impose a 20% tax on all inbound money transfers it would:
1. Be incredibly stupid, since that's the same as telling foreign investors 'lol fuck off'
2. Be incredibly illegal, a European court will shoot this down within a week.
This is pure bullshit, the only sources are shitty blogs and actual bitcoin sites.

And we all saw how that ended when Mt Gox collapsed and people here wanted regulators to step in in order to get their money back. Sometimes people don't make the best decisions and when that happens you can either say 'tough luck, suffer the consequences of your stupidity and live in poverty for a few years' or say 'ok, we'll step in to help you'. A third option is to prevent this stuff from happening and that seems like a better option in the first place.

If someone missed it:
* They state their shares represent 0.2 Bitcoins

Translation, they're offering shares where you pay +- $100 per bitcoin, for a total of 200 000 bitcoin. Now before you all start screaming "this is good news", it also means the Winklevoss' want to offload 200 000 bitcoin.

What? How does this get upvoted?


This is correct.


This is not. The *people* in Western-Europe have a lot of savings. Governments don't like deflation simply because consumption drops when there is deflation. Gross domestic product is the sum of investments, consumption, and government expenses. When you have $ 1000 in savings and expect you'll be able to buy more with it in the next year, you'll postpone non-necessary expenses and thus consumption as a whole will drop.

The EU internal market basically says capital transfers may not be impeded, that includes stuff like small charges to the customers.
Banks, however, are perfectly allowed to charge other banks for using their services. Which is probably what happened here.
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:03:24
Intrest rates were so high because inflation was so high, they're closely linked.
The economy isn't centrally planned, the central banks control inflation by allowing banks to borrow money at high/low interest rates. This in turn allows the banks to increase/decrease their own interest rates they charge customers for loans etc.


If that had happened in 2007 the economy would've crashed. Liquidity ran out, and banks stopped lending money to one another. Having no way of government interference when shit hits the fan really isn't a good thing.
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:24:01
You're right, better now than later, but when there already are several exchanges that deal with millions of dollars worth of bitcoin each day I really expect their systems to *not* be vulnerable to a DDoS attack.

Especially since it apparently exploits a problem that was known for several years.

"This is good news for bitcoin!"
Price of bitcoin rising that much in that timeframe really isn't that good news for bitcoin *as a currency*, which is the goal I believe. If you'd say it's good news for people who invested in bitcoin at the start and never sold them, I'd agree with you. But this is exactly what *shouldn't* happen with a currency: people have no inclination to spend them (a. k. a. use them as a currency) whatsover.


Then how should it be handled? You just pointed out its strong characteristics as an asset and thus saying it's not a good currency (meaning people aren't inclined to spend it), and you say you shouldn't daytrade with bitcoin. So basically you're saying it's a long-term investment?


I fully agree with this but don't you think it's worrying that a year after the massive price hike and media exposure of bitcoin, the bitcoin industry is still so inaccessible towards the average economic agent?
Where do you see this going?
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:02:58


Fair point, even though I think this kind of borders on paranoia.


Various other tools are availbe for that. Torrents, Tor, Twitter, pastebin, to name a few. Sure, they are less secure but their audience is much greater.


Banks can't just overwrite their internal algorythms you know. They can't just enter a random amount of money for a certain bank account. They use balance sheets all the time, it's literally impossible to just do this.


Yeah, that's why we have notaries/lawyers/judges and the like.


I can cut out some pieces of paper right now and declare it my personal coins, and literally no one will accept it cause it's absolutely pointless.


Not bitcoin specific. You can do the same thing with other more accessible software.


You can do the same thing with fiat money and a contract.


A lot of financial instruments do the exact same thing and even give you an interest rate for doing so.


No you can't. First you buy bitcoin ==&gt; transaction fee paid to the guy who sells you bitcoin. You transfer them at no cost. Other dude sells them and again pays a transaction fee to the guy buying his bitcoin. You'll always pay some margin.


Why would you want this?

The wording isn't that suspicious really. It's marketing directed at a niche audience.
As you said though, the "150% return AND no risk!!!" should immediatly raise red flags. There's no such thing as a no-risk investment with that high of a return. If you're lucky a zero-risk investment will yield you a return of 2% these days.
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:26:43
No, the news really isn't getting better at all. At the time of the price height, bitcoin was all over the news and everyone who read the economic section in any newspaper had heard of it. I live in Belgium and both my 54 year old parents had heard about it in that manner.
Ever since then bitcoin has stagnated. Functionality is still pretty much the same, and it's still *way* too complicated for the common person to understand/use. Meanwhile, the number of people in Belgium who use mobile banking (by cellphone that is) has risen from 5% to 30% in the last year. Bitcoin simply isn't growing fast enough.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:26:44


You misread what I said: they aren't the only options people who *haven't* already invested in bitcoins have. 


It works both ways though. Those market swings are also an incentive for people to just not switch to bitcoin, but continue using their good old dollars.
It's entirely possible those market swings might disappear in a while though, I'm talking about the system as it is right now.

Uhm, yes. This is called inflation. They might be able to sell their products for more USD a year later, but those USD will be worth as much as the current amount of USD they sell it for now, is worth right now.

According to you, what's a Keynesian and which part of my comment exactly shows I'm a keynesian?
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:01:50
First, what I think is speculation. It's what I *think* will happen. That's it.
Personally, due to its inherent flaws, contrasting with modern economies,  I don't think bitcoin will ever make an entry in the real world economy. By that, I mean your average soccer mom going to the bakery, and buying a bread with bitcoins. 
I do think it has a nice future on electronic markets, like people running some sort of ebay marketplace from their home. The small type of enterprises. They have a clear incentive to avoid transaction fees. Larger companies, I doubt it. I doubt they're willing to expose themselves to certain currency instability in order to avoid some commission fees. 
What might happen though, is that companies accept payments in bitcoins, and then immediatly exchange them for USD/Other currencies on secondary markets. Though they'll only implement such systems if they think it's actually worth it, and of course exchanging those bitcoins again leaves them with the same agency costs they were trying to avoid in the first place.
Still leaves the problems of a possible crash though. I assume some people have bought large amounts of bitcoins when they were still cheap. If those people suddenly decide to cash in on their bitcoins, the price will drop significantly. Then more people might panick and sell their btc, etc. No central banking system has its disadvantages as well (where a central bank could possible lessen the effects of such a shock). 
I think such a price shock is inevitable in the long run and when that happens I think the bitcoin system will crash. But again, I might very well be wrong here.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:39:00
24 year old economist here (without grey hairs). Currently I hold an analyst position in the national bank of Belgium.
Personally I have several issues with bitcoins:
- Lack of central banking might seem fantastic to libertarians, but to me it just says "no way of interfering once a crash happens", which undoubtedly will happen at one point or another. Not a big problem right now , but I don't see naturally risk-averse agents for instance converting their life savings to bitcoin when they have no guarantee the system won't crash.
- The volatility. A lot of bitcoiners say "wow, bitcoin is a fantastic investment!" and that might be the case, but to me it's also a huge reason why it won't ever be mainstream currency. Clearly people have a huge incentive to not actually spend their bitcoins, but to hold on to them: they'll be worth more in the future. When it comes to currencies, people want something stable.
- However, it *is* possible that the huge volatility issues would be solved if more people adapt to the currency. But, the way it is right now: people are risk-averse. No one with a normal amount of money would invest their life savings in a currency this volatile when there are much more stable initiatives available.
- People use bitcoins for their anonimity, sometimes when committing illegal transactions. Government agencies have a clear motivation to take away the anonimity of bitcoins. I know you all think it's entirely safe and perhaps it is, but government agencies being actually opposed to this new currency makes me doubt its ability to once become wide-spread. 
Don't get me wrong, I think it's an interesting experiment and perhaps an interesting investment opportunity for people who like investing in risky stuff, but I never see it being adapted as an actual currency. People want stability in a currency, not huge volatility.
If anyone disagrees, feel free to correct me.
PS: and you're right, personally I'm very interested bitcoins and would love to see its evolution. I don't believe in it myself but it is a fascinating thing to study.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:29:17
E-gold might've been a digital currency, but unlike bitcoin it had an underlying value: gold. Central banks did keep an eye on it, but as far as I'm aware there were no warnings.
Central banks are warning consumers now that bitcoin has no underlying value, with e-gold you were effectively trading the ownership if tiny pieces of gold nuggets.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:19:36


Oh I certainly agree here, I think bitcoin in its current form is perfectly complementary to another currency. But...


Would you really? Knowing that your dollars would be worth slightly less in a month but that there's a reasonable chance your bitcoins would be worth more? I don't think that most people when given the  option would choose to spend their bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:06:40
Oh I find it fascinating as well and I do agree with you that with its properties it can do a lot to help certain people, the ones you talked about. For them, BTC is without a doubt advantageous.
But for the larger part of the society (and more specifically the governments etc) implementation of bitcoins as a widespread currency does not have advantages. Governments lose their ability to steer the economy for instance. They will do what they can to prevent losing this ability, which is why I don't see it becoming a global (i.e. used to buy "common goods") currency. 
But again, I agree with you that in its current state it's without a doubt a good thing.

@_date: 2013-12-02 12:51:29


This is why I don't see bitcoin ever becoming a widespread currency.
Here's an easy question. Let's say you own a special rock, and you can trade that rock right now for a rusty knife. But, then someone comes along and tells you that if you just wait a week, you could actually buy a brand new knife. What would you do?
This is why economists like inflation: the value of money dropping by as little as 2% a year, gives people an incentive to spend now. The value of their money rising hugely year after year, gives people an incentive to *hold on* to their money, which is why they'll never  use it for regular goods.

Another economists here. You're entirely correct, to me bitcoin seems like a huge bubble. Its volatility (which is cherished by the bitcoin community) is exactly why I don't ever see it adapting as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:44:55
Sorry, I honestly cannot speculate about that. If I look at its characteristics, I don't think bitcoin has a future as a worldwide currency and I just cannot imagine a worldwide economy running on a currency I don't see functioning. I would love to answer, but it's a question I'm just not able to answer.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:26:44
"No intermediary costs" has its advantages for local governments there but also (obviously) has its disadvantages for local banks/companies. Some companies are on the receiving end of those intermediary fees.
Second, bitcoin has performed extraordinarily well in the past years as I'm sure you'd agree. No (rational) agent in Africa would choose to spend that currency on whatever if they think it would be worth ten times more in a year. You say "taking volatility aside" , but that is a huge condition at the moment.
Third world countries want their own currency to be stable, which is why a lot of them peg their own currency to the dollar or euro. Even assuming low (enough) volatility, I doubt a lot of them would be attracted to no one able to interfere once the system starts crashing (which can happen in every monetary system).
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:49:40


Bitcoin's utility has always been based on its possible future as a worldwide currency. If you're argument is it doesn't matter if it's banned from being a currency, because it has a value as an asset, namely it's future fate as a currency, there is some error in your reasoning.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:31:46
Yes, I'm sure you know a lot more about financial systems than teh ones who actually study how those things work.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:46:51


Bitcoin users want to see bitcoin accepted as a currency, not as a means to investment. An investment opportunity is directly opposed to a currency: when you think the value of something will rise, you're not going to spend it.


This shows me you know nothing at all about economics. There are dozens of new economic theories popping up each year. Saying economists "refuse to change" when they constantly adapt their ideas to the surrounding world is wrong.


Again, wrong. Do you even know how wide the economic field is? Micro- macro- economics, investment opportunities etcetera. Personally I tested a model on how mineral pricing might be able to explain the stock liquidity for mineral producers, and I ended up with an R² value of 70%. 
Sure, not everything but to claim economics has "weak testing probabilities" when basically every economic study develops hypotheses and then tests them is wrong. Check google scholar a bit.
Yes, people try committing fraud in the real world but why you think this is the fault of economists is beyond me. But perhaps I misunderstand you.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:04:00
Because  "spending them" or "investing in bitcoins" aren't the only two options  people who haven't invested in bitcoins have.
Your explanation is correct when you think bitcoins are the *only* way to invest your money, bit it isn't. Most people won't choose to invest a large part of their money because of the [risk-return]( thing involved. 
Yes, the possible returns are huge and so are the risks involved. Again, this goes for possible *new* adopters of the currency. 
People are naturally risk averse. Don't overestimate the amount of people who actually actively invest their money in certain assets.
Consider yourself, I assume you owe bitcoins. You think there's a big chance the price of bitcoins will rise in the future. Have you invested almost all your dollars in bitcoins? Or just a bit? That's basically the number one rule in investing: "spread your money, lower your risks".
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:19:22
They stated it is a danger for anyone buying them, so consumers, since they aren't backed by any regulation (which is of course true). Since now demand for bitcoins from the customers will be lower, companies are less likely to actually install the technology needed to accept payments in bitcoins.
Why would you accept a currency that has shown huge fluctuation when there's a stable alternative? Sure, bitpay can possibly hedge against that risk but don't think all companies are aware of that possibility. Either way, to companies, not accepting bitcoins right now means having no risk at all, where accepting bitcoins gives them no competitive advantage. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:59:45
Oh perhaps in a bit average users could have the possibility to switch to bitcoins.
But, with the current volatility, no one would do it. People are naturally risk-averse. Bitcoin has (as you are well aware) huge fluctuations in its price. 
As of right now, bitcoins are an interesting investment opportunity for people who like some risk. But this is exactly why it's *not* a good currency either. People have a direct incentive to hold on to their bitcoins ("perhaps they'll be worth more if we wait a bit longer"), instead of spending them.
Tell me: would you use a part of a bitcoin right now to go buy a bread at the bakery if you expect that part of bitcoins to be able to buy you 5 breads at the end of the month? Or would you just use some dollars for it, since their value wouldn't increase? (slightly decrease in fact)
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:34:02


It *is* important in the current economic system. Sure, it might change in a decade or so, but right now the economy runs on consumption. I'm not saying this is good or bad, but it's how things are. Bitcoin is a currency that gives people an incentive to save, and not consume.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:48:20
And thanks for that.
But let's assume you wanted to buy a house. Let's say you could buy a house now for 800 bitcoins, but if you wait a year you think you might be able to buy a house for just 700 bitcoins. Would you buy that house now, or would you postpone buying that house?
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:15:00

No worries. But, even though I'm saying I never see it as a global reserve currency, that does not mean I don't like the way it's being used right now. I think that in its current role it's actually beneficial to the global economy.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:29:51


Exactly. I hear people say "the volatility will decrease once the currency is adopted by more people" and they're right, but in order to be adopted by more people (as a currency), the volatility needs to decrease first. Not the other way around.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:43:09

@_date: 2013-12-02 14:46:51
No worries.
Again, as it is being used right now I do not think bitcoin will implode soon. I have no idea what might happen to it and am rather excited to see what *is* going to happen to it. But I do not think it'll ever be an acceptable global currency.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:05:52
No, I quoted it because it's exactly the issue with using bitcoins as a currency. You might like using a currency that rises in value to buy common goods, but a rational agent would never do so if he has alternatives available.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:03:19

KBC Bank in Belgium. Their stock was at €7 some time in december 2011, sold them for €35 somewhere in august this year.


Agreed, but you leave out the part where taxpayers future shoulders would be far more damaged by *not* granting those cash injections.


Complete bullshit. Some other banks had low capital ratios and were strengthened to avoid a domino effect.
Also, that bank I was talking about (KBC) had to pay an interest of 50% on their regional government loans, and an interest of 9.5% of their federal loan. Eventually taxpayers actually made a profit.
Which is not to say I think the current financial system is okay. The banks are without a doubt too big to fail, and *should* be able to go bankrupt without threatening the entire economy when it happens. This is currently the case, so governments around the world made the correct decision to stop this from happening.
But, far too little legislation is being processed to actually prevent this in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:14:20
Yes, you used your money to invest in BTC and that was a great decision. But, you held on to your bitcoins, and didn't spend them. This is what's required for a currency to actually work.
Again, I think bitcoins are an interesting investment opportunity for people who favour high risks-high returns kind of things. But I do not see it catching on as a global currency (like the USD for instance).
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:26:58
Which is the exact reason why it wouldn't work as a currency right now: the incentive to hold on to them rather than spending them is just too big.
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:31:29
Yeah I do agree bitcoin is a very interesting experiment, but the lack of some central control rather scares me (though this is a matter of ideology I suppose). 
I surely believe bitcoin could be an interesting alternative (people having the option to opt out of the banking system can only make the banks behave better), but I don't see it ever becoming mainstream. Keep in mind that only 53 million Americans so far do their banking online.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:34:56
Because why the fuck would you spend for instance 800 bitcoins on a house now, when you can buy the exact same house for 700 bitcoins a year later and don't need to move right away?

Because those $100 000 are worth 100 000 breads right now (when a bread costs 1$) , just like in a year it'll be worth 100 000 breads (when they cost 1.05$). That's how inflation works. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:03:47


For certain goods, yes. For others, where there is no clear technological advantage, no.


People spending money means companies can sell their products. Companies selling their products means they can make a profit and hire more workers, and pay salaries. Basically, should everyone stop spending a lot of companies will lose money and will fire workers as a result. It could be that this would in the long term lead to a more sustainable economic model, but in the short run a lot of people would be hurt.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:23:47
Some people here don't realise "but it's an awesome investment" and "it could be a great currency" are completely contradictory. If you think someone is going to be  a good investment, you're not going to sell it (or, in case of a currency: use it). 
In the current economy, a currency needs to have some inflation or otherwise it's doomed to fail.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:19:45


Yes, but desiring bitcoin to be acceptable as a 'normal' currency by most merchants implies a lot of the public using bitcoins wouldn't be true believers at that point, and thus postpone spending if they expect the price to rise.


Completely agreed. I think it's fascinating as well, but as you said the governments wouldn't like it. And, governments would do anything they can to stop it from being accepted as a global currency (this sounds incredibly conspiratard but you get the point).


Correct, but I wonder about the government response should bitcoins actually "leak" into the "real" economy (implying the economy would fall out of government control).


That's the issue really, if they want to settle their role in the financial landscape they already **need** to be stable, not the other way around.


Small companies not having to pay 'classic' fees for payment is undoubtedly good for those companies, but it's not good for the actual recipients of those payments. Now, before everyone starts screaming 'screw the banks': I do agree banks have way too much power these days. 
But the fact still is the life savings of virtually everyone are still mostly on a savings account in a bank somewhere. Those transaction fees going away and hurting the banks might seem good at first sight, but if banks start falling over again a *lot* of people will lose their savings. I'm not defending the current system, I'm saying it like it is right now.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:20:11

Okay, what about a car? Would you buy a car now if you think by just saving your bitcoins, you'd be able to buy two cars in a couple of months?
Don't get me wrong, bitcoins look like a nice investment opportunity to people who like some risk, due to its huge volatility. But exactly that volatility is why it won't be a widely accepted currency in this state. 'Normal' people want their currency to be stable, not volatile.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:24:20


And it's also the key feature why it would never be a main currency. When it goes about their life savings, people want a government to interfere when the system might crash.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:30:10


Yes, or in other words, your dollars losing value makes you consume more. I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing, but it's how our current economy operates. Bitcoins have been gaining value in the past year, so you have no incentive to actually spend them on consumption.

The "time" argument works for some goods, but certainly doesn't work for all goods (a new car, a new house,...). Say you live in an average household, would you choose to spend some dollars (that will be worth less in a bit) or would you spend some bitcoins? (whose value might increase in a month)?
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:58:12


Yeah there's a lot of debate about that. But, the current governments all agree centralized power is a good thing and would never voluntarily adopt bitcoins into their economy, since that would imply they lose control over their economy.


As do I, but personally (though I could be wrong) that its volatility would ever decrease enough to be acceptable as a 'normal' currency.


Agreed, but the current governments don't like anonymous currencies, and will do what they can to fight it. As you said, HSBC laundered drug money and they got punished (not enough) for it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:06:52


That's because gold has an underlying value. There's a huge gold market, remember.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:17:23
Sure for most basic goods there's a time factor involved (e.g. clothes, food,...) but when it comes to other goods (cars, houses, a new PC) often that time factor is less important and some would be happy to postpone their spending if they think their money would be worth more in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:51:55
I'm not defending the "ancient system", nor do I think the current economic system is ideal in any way possible. But the ones who actually make decisions in these economies fully support it, and they'll do what they can to stop widespread adoption of bitcoin as a currency. Which means its huge problem of volatility at the moment might possibly not disappear.
It's not a matter of "defending the ancient system", it's just saying it how I see it. And yes, people do prefer *spending* money that decreases in value. And yes, they prefer *holding on* to money that increases in value. And you need to spend  a currency to make it succesful, not hold on to it.
The current economic system and bitcoins simply don't work together.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:04:25


Would you spend your bitcoins now on for instance a new car, if you think by holding onto them for a couple months more you'll be able to buy a bigger car?
Of course currencies can be investment opportunities, for foreign people. Domestic people investing in their own currency means they're not spending their money but holding on to it, and thus not fueling consumption. Which is exactly why it wouldn't be able to actually become a mainstream currency.


No, it's not. Economists develop a model, then select a dataset, test their model, and reject their hypothesis or accept it according to the results. Claiming "economics has weak testing capabilities" is outright bullshit.


Then please tell me what you mean by this:

@_date: 2013-12-02 16:53:36


There are trillions in gold reserve exactly because people think it's enormously stable. Which you can easily see by the price history: gold always becomes more popular when stock markets crash and vice versa. But huge price swings are very rare. 


I certainly agree here, but after some (quick) googling I haven't found things like bitcoin put- or call options.


It would, but I think that in order to achieve widespread adoption, the volatility would need to decrease significantly first. Not the other way around. 


I'm not sure I understand you here. Of course there will always be some consumption, but in case of luxury goods for instance (new car, new house,...), people would postpone buying those things.


Agreed. But most companies would prefer being paid in inherently stable currencies. Right now, bitcoin is still a very young currency and not that stable.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:15:18


The thing is, for bitcoins to ever be a widespread currency it would need to be adapted by "normal" agents as well. For instance a family of five who invested their life savings in bitcoins (and not dollars). Do you really think a family like that thinks "no one can interfere once a crash happens" is a desirable feature?


I agree with you that the volatility will decrease once more people adopt it as a means of payment, but I don't think it'll ever decrease enough to the point where it would be an acceptable currency. 


That's possible, I don't know much about the technical details of bitcoin. That brings me back to your first remark though, you might think "no way of interfering once a crash happens is a feature" but governments would never see that as a positive thing.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:39:49


Source? I'm being serious, I haven't ever heard of a succesful unregulated free banking system. 


Your interpretation is wrong. You agree that the closing of the Silk Road had a significant effect on the bitcoin price by making it drop, but since it then started climbing again you argue the closing of the Silk Road was actually beneficial. The price started rising again because people saw it had crashed, and still thought it was an interesting investment opportunity.
Nothing wrong with this for an asset, but it's not desirable (volatility) for a currency.


I completely agree and I also agree that the volatility will drop in the future. I just wonder if it will drop enough to become acceptable as a mainstream currency.


This is completely false. People are naturally risk-averse, and not a single sane person would invest all their money in such a volatile product. Or do I need to point you to the post of that one dude a couple weeks ago who invested his life savings in bitcoins, and almost lost it all?
Of course some people might invest in bitcoins with euros later on, but how that leads to "no one using euros to spend" is beyond me. People invest their money now as well you know..


I don't think people would be willing to risk their life savings on an "if". Again, people are risk-averse.


Huh? You mean those same politicians who voted on a 75% income tax on high incomes?
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:59:35
It means you have an incentive to postpone your consumption. Consumption is what drives today's economy, so the current economy simply cannot function on bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:44:12


And there you have it. You have an incentive to hold on to your bitcoins, instead of spending them. Which is certainly not desirable in the (current) economic sytem.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:20:45
Yes I certainly agree that the volatility will decrease as it becomes more adopted. But I do wonder if it will ever decrease enough to the point of being acceptable as a "normal" currency. 
It's entirely possible that it will, but I honestly doubt it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:24:06


Thing is, for that to work it needs to have some underlying value as well. Otherwise people will be much happier putting their money into a savings account somewhere


I don't think so. People are very risk-averse, no new investor would invest in something their government has repeatedly warned about, and regardless of that, the volatility would scare the crap out of them.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:26:07


No. Most people don't invest because they generally don't trust the stock markets. People are perfectly fine with just putting their money in their savings account.
Assume you have a world where everyone has bitcoins though, then you don't *need* to make the decision anymore on whether you invest it or not. It's already invested in bitcoins, and those right now have the property that as time goes on, their value rises. Economists don't like deflation for a reason you know.

Oh I don't think the current capitalistic system we have is ideal, far from it. But as you said, spending would be reduced by implementing bitcoins and that might lead to a loss of jobs. You might think that's completely acceptable, but 99% of actual policy makers do not think this is acceptable. Which is why I don't see bitcoin taking off as an actual currency (with the current ideological system in place).
