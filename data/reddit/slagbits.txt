I think the kids growing up now will be the ones who make it mainstream. It is not something new and frightening for them.

Hehe

I'm gonna need a quick summary of this click bait. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:20:18
I found it open: 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:10:27
But I want bricks of it. With the band around. So I can feel like a millionaire. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 10:10:43
Same happened to me. Must be a glitch in the matrix. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:38:49
That means I can have 15 nodes running. If I set up all my old phones.

Motherfucker don't scare people. I headed straight over to Livecoinwatch.com to check. Everything is green.... It's more like Hit me baby one more time Britney.

I'm getting one in orange and one in periwinkle green.
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:52:43
Same, blocked him.
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:57:50
To late. Already put all my retirement savings in crypto.
@_date: 2019-04-24 06:35:52
That's a brilliant idea. We should make it an annual event.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:06:54
Hey hey hey, slow down there buddy. Only spend what you can afford to loose 
@_date: 2018-11-10 13:56:41
So much for 2FA. Only safe wallet is an offline wallet.

 Man you are already on the moon with that goldmine. 
What colour lambo are you getting? 
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:56:47
But more importantly, they support Doge. They are really ahead of the competition.

I cant belive people still listen to him 
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:53:33
HODL, no sell.  Then..... Lambo.

Fuck yeah Baby

Start with a quarter of what you save every month. If you don't save anything, you should start saving. Crypto is still young. And profits could be years away.

I started buying at around 15k on the way down last time. And have been buying the dip ever since. So I am really hoping it fucking moons. But I'm as sure as the weatherman.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:16:58
But I can afford to loose all my fiat. It's just funny money anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:29:47
Nope. Just find a number you can live with. Get familiar with the tech and how to use it. The deeper you dig in to it the more you want to invest.
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:12:39
My thoughts exactly. 
I'm thinking about getting mine in a custom colour and with magnesium rims.
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:34:05
That's fine. I'll hodl. And every time it trends down. BUY THE DIP,
@_date: 2018-12-10 10:49:18
What are you 90? Because Lambo's are fucking awesome /s
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:26:25
Um... so should I get my crypto back on the exchange and pull it on Jan 03.   
 /S
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:55:14
That's it. 
I'm with this guy. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:41:02
Forever. Or at least until..... LAMBO.
