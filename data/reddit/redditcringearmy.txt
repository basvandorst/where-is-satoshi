So how do I avoid something like this? Do I not need to use an online wallet like coinbase ad store my money in paper wallets?
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:05:27
I don't understand why mtgox says  the value of a bitcoin is $275.00, but when I go to coinbase to buy one, they want $650 for one. Who do I trust? Where do I go to find out how much value in USD my bitcoins have?

What price did you purchase at?

A better title would be "Bitcoin search interest declines to Dec. 2013 bubble level."

":a form of investment in which each paying participant recruits two or more further participants, with returns being given to early participants using money contributed by later ones."
The whole reason it is called a "pyramid" scheme is because the distribution model resembles a pyramid. BTC speculation does not involve recruiting participants under you, and then taking profits from those people under you. That is the definition of a pyramid scheme. BTC has no relation to a pyramid scheme at all.

So youre saying we should all dump bitcoin??
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:09:07
With a $900 investment you would have only lost about $70. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:48:40
I don't think you know how pyramid schemes work. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 23:28:12
Maybe you'll figure it out once you've been in the bitcoin game a little longer, bro. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:26:47
So you're letting everyone here know you are in possession of $5100? Not very smart.

This is like a battered wife saying "Im just glad he broke my right arm and didn't also give me a black eye."
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:42:31
Did they save 25% of the crypto when it was $19,500?
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:48:46
Of course it matters considering they were likely accepting significantly fewer purchases with bitcoin when it was at $100, when almost no one was using Bitcoin, compared to to how much they accepted at $19,500 when millions of people were using it. You said they "made so much money" so I assume you are privy to those amounts? How much did they make at $100 vs $19,500? How do you know they didn't lose so much money?

I predict the exact opposite of everything this guy has said. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:23:00
Wrong, adoption is held back by volatility. None of my friends want to use bitcoin because they don't want to lose 50% in 3 week. No retailers want to lose 8% of their purchases in 12 hours.

Or maybe he'll be broke. It's not like you have any idea. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:51:03
You are basically telling people on the Internet that you have $800 in a digital format, and using your main account which has a significant amount of personal information on it. This is just an invitation for hackers. I would recommend deleting this post.
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:59:04
Nice hyperbole. No one is talking about a crash over $20. People talk this when when the price drops 4+ percent in 24 hours, which happens several times a week now. That is why you see those comments over and over. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:32:05
Because then he will realize he could have bought 18 bitcoins instead of 10. Although ti doesn't matter because he is full of shit and didn't actually buy. He's trolling. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:54:19
Well, if your colleague literally said in December 2018 "Bitcoin aint looking so good now is it," then he would have been 100% correct.

What is "enjoyable" about losing significant amounts of money? I never understood that "enjoy the ride" comment. Why would anyone enjoy a negative aspect of the ride? Are there people who like losing? I'll be happy to "enjoy the ride" when it goes up.

If I hadn't panic sold two weeks ago I'd be 4k poorer right now. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:16:59
15k, 10k, 8k, and 6200k were all also declared as "buying opportunities"
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:32:19
I came here to say this. Unless they have already expressed an interest in this, it will be more of an annoyance than a gift. Most people will not understand it, and not want to deal with the hassle of keeping up with it and trying to research what it is and how to use it, and having to figure out how to sell it. Just give them normal gift cards.

How come companies can have their transactions instantly converted to dollars, but I can't? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:28:47
Why can't they offload them? Is it hard to sell them?
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:31:06


So if I take someone's car without asking, and return it to them a week later that is not stealing? Where are you getting your definition from?
