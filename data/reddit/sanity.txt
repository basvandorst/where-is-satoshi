The ledger is public, but control of private keys is not.  Is it seriously necessary to explain this to you?  You can try to revise history all you want, but it's right there clear as day in Satoshi's paper:


parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly 
precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in 
another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending 
an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is 
similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of 
individual trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.

Recessions may be caused by the popping of a bubble, but your claim that bubbles are caused by inflating the currency supply, or fractional reserve banking is incorrect.
Bubbles are generally caused by the false assumption that the past is always a good predictor of the future, compounded by the self-reinforcing effect of people attempting to anticipate other people's behavior and acting accordingly.  Keynes captured this idea in his [beauty contest]( thought experiment.
There is no requirement here for currency inflation or fractional reserve banking, bubbles require only short-term thinking which can happen regardless of your economic system.

No, it discourages people from accepting it and then hoarding it for long periods of time.  There is no disincentive to accepting it provided you exchange it for something else fairly quickly, which is the behavior we want as it encourages commerce.
It's also the behavior that occurs with US dollars.  People are very happy to accept dollars, but almost nobody then stuffs them into their mattress, at least they put them in a bank where they can earn interest.  In contrast, there are plenty of people with lots of bitcoins stuffed into their digital mattresses.

No, the problem is that the value of their currency, the "scrip", is fixed - which creates an incentive for people to hoard it - which causes the system to grid to a halt.
The solution is to continuously inject new "scrip" into the system, devaluing the existing scrip and discouraging hoarding.
You could see a similar thing happing with bitcoins when they got up above $30 in value, everyone decided that they were better off to hold-on to their bitcoins than to spend them.

You have a weird definition of "met".  If people are able to buy bitcoins at all at whatever price, as they always will be, then the demand is being met.

Please do then.  Stating something does not make it so.


Not according to Adam Smith and almost every economist since.


**Specialization** is how an economy develops, that was Adam Smith's great insight.  One requirement for specialization is a willingness for people to transact through some common currency.  If the currency itself starts to be seen as an investment, then people are discouraged from spending it.
@_date: 2012-10-09 15:32:48


It discourages transactions.  Overal wealth ("The Wealth of Nations") is dependent on our ability to specialize.  I get good at growing corn, you get good at making clothes.  Without currency we can only barter, which is inefficient because I may not need clothes right now, and you might not need corn.  A currency is a lubricant for trading, and so it's good for the general wealth and well-being.
But if the currency itself becomes an investment then nobody wants to spend it, it discourages transactions which ultimately hurts our ability to specialize, and that is bad.
@_date: 2012-04-25 22:59:42
It might be different if your money was increasing in value just by sitting on it - but actually it decreases in value with time, which encourages people to spend it.
@_date: 2012-10-09 22:16:58


Actually, I seem to know more about the links that you yourself are citing, after spending just a few minutes reading them.
Neither of these suggest that the use of scrip were anything more than small-scale experiments, motivated by a desire to support the local economy (a misguided motivation if you ask any economist).  It sounds like it was used like a local loyalty card.

No need for ad hominem, you don't help your argument with it.




In order to debunk an analogy it isn't sufficient to merely point out that it is a simplification of reality, **all** analogies are, by their nature, a simplification of reality.
You need to explain why the simplification is an unreasonable one, and you have failed to do so.


Sorry, it wasn't my intention to be rude.


The cash demand is being met, you'll still be able to buy Bitcoins, it will just be at an ever-increasing price, especially since Bitcoins are so easily divisible.  Even when Bitcoins were at $30, there were still people willing to sell them to you.


You are quick to reprimand me for any hint of patronization, yet you then patronize me?  That's a bit hypocritical, don't you think?  I can assure you that I've thought deeply about all kinds of currency.
Your argument seems entirely predicated that people won't be able to acquire bitcoins at all during a spiral situation, but that's not true.  There will always be *some* price at which somebody is willing to sell them, it will just be an ever-increasing price.

@_date: 2012-10-09 15:04:21


Because if Bitcoins are constantly appreciating in value then people will hoard Bitcoins rather than spend them, which causes deflation.


No, the absence of economic activity (consumption) ultimately results in less wealth later.  Imagine that nobody transacted with each other, we'd all be reduced to subsistance and we'd be living like cavemen again.  A deflationary spiral discourages consumption and investment which ultimately hurts everyone (because it makes specialization more difficult, see Adam Smith).

Governments avoid this by printing money to discourage hoarding, and as a result, to encourage consumption and investment.


I don't think you've thought this through.  Why would anyone want to use any currency other than Bitcoin if Bitcoin was appreciating in value?  The whole problem is that everyone wants to keep their wealth in an appreciating currency.

For much of which it was illegal for American citizens to own gold personally, and when the British Ambassador tried to "cash in" his dollars, the US reneged.  Are you sure you want to cite this period to justify being on the gold standard?


Yes, tech has dropped in value, and people do actually delay purchasing decisions if they think that a new IPhone is about to come out.  It's not binary, it's a matter of degrees.  Add in a situation where people can increase their purchasing power just by hoarding currency, it will discourage purchasing even more, or so the argument goes.


So the economy was booming during the Great Depression?  I think a few historians might disagree with you on that one.

Do you understand that a high-bandwidth application like BitTorrent using 3X the traffic (plus the CPU overhead of all of the encryption) that it normally does is absolutely a big risk?
As I've said several times, this might not be a problem while I2P has such a small userbase, but it would fall over immediately if people started to use it at-scale for BitTorrent.

Underwriters can be stubbornly stupid.
Last year I had a loan rejected because I own a significant % of a Venture Capital funded startup.
The idiot underwriter insisted that because the company's expenses were higher than its revenues (which is always the case with a VC funded startup, that's why you raise VC in the first place), that the equity was a liability, not an asset.  
Anyone with the most rudimentary understanding of accounting would understand that the equity was an asset, at worst it was worth nothing, but under no circumstances could it be a liability.
They didn't care that they were being illogical, I didn't get that loan.  I tried with a different loan company and simply didn't mention that asset, got the loan no problem.
tl;dr - these people can be idiots.

Interesting, although actually I have a hard time seeing how that is fair.
IANAL but I'm 99% sure that in Ireland, the UK, and the US, if you purchase stolen goods, even if you didn't know they were stolen, then you don't own the goods.  
I know this because someone stole my brother's motorbike a few years back in Ireland, and months later he found someone riding it at a motorbike race.  The police took the bike from the person who had bought it and gave it back to my brother.  The guy who purchased it was out of luck, unless he could recover his money from whomever he purchased the bike from.
This makes sense because only the owner of something has the right to transfer ownership.  The "buyer" is being mislead by the thief into thinking they are buying the bike, but really they aren't.
So you are saying that if someone steals my TV in Holland, and then sell it, and I find the person that they sold it to - I'm out of luck unless I can prove they recipient acted in bad faith?  That seems extremely unfair.  The buyer was defrauded by the thief, why should the person from whom the thief stole bear the consequences?

I do not dispute that this may be the case under Dutch law, my point is that if true, Dutch law is unjust, and contrary to a fundamental principal of the concept of "ownership".
Specifically, the principle is that only the owner of something can transfer ownership to someone else.  This isn't an American principle, or even an Anglo-Saxon principle.  It follows intuitively from the very definition of what it means to "own" something.


And I think this is wrong.  Morally, no sale occurred, because only the owner can agree to transfer ownership.  The fact that the buyer innocently but erroneously believes it to be a sale does not make it so.


No, I did not and do not *presuppose* US law to be correct.
I believe the US law to be correct *in this situation* because it is consistent with universal principles of property rights, specifically that only an owner can transfer ownership.  Perhaps there are other situations where Dutch law might be superior to US law, but this isn't one of them.


I don't acknowledge this because I do not believe that the Dutch system as you've described it has merit.  The system as you've described it does an injustice to the owner of the stolen item by giving their property to the buyer.  Whatever fraud the thief may have perpetrated against the buyer should have no impact on the owner's ownership of the item.
Under US law, an injustice is done to the buyer by the thief, but not by the system.






Yes, and if true, Dutch law has unjustly deprived the rightful owner of their property.

Speaking as a sometimes CTO, this doesn't make sense.  Defensive patents only make sense if you're attacked by another company that *is itself vulnerable to a counter-suit*.
Patent trolls don't actually do anything other than suing people over patents, and so unless you happen to have patented patent trolling, any patents you have are useless against them.
And while I'm sure Brian's intentions are pure, I doubt he can guarantee that the intentions of whoever has control of the company in 3, 5, or 10 years will be similarly altruistic.

I also have concerns with IP law, but I think that is off-topic.  Bitcoins require no government enforcement for their excludability.


If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, its probably a duck.  Bitcoins walk and quack like property, are you really accomplishing anything by trying to claim that they aren't property?

As I said, Bitcoins require no government intervention to ensure that they are excludable, IP does.

I think our ways of looking at it are fundamentally different.
I'm taking a bottom-up axiomatic approach, asking what is actually happening at each stage of the scenario, and seeing where we end up when we put the steps together.  You are taking a top-down approach, looking at it as a ledger of who suffers an injustice, without regard to the details of how it occurs.
With your way of looking at it, sure, under one scenario person A is ok, and person B suffers, and under the other scenario, person B is ok, and person A suffers.  You could see them as equivalent.
However I believe the law is more than simply balancing a ledger of injustice, it *is* relevant how the injustices actually occur, and when you examine it from this perspective, the US approach is clearly superior.
With my axiomatic approach, I begin with the premise that only the owner of some property can transfer ownership.
Looking at it this way, under US law, B is defrauded by the thief, A never loses ownership because A didn't transfer ownership.  A has every right to reclaim their property, regardless of whatever transpired between B and the thief.
But under the Dutch approach, something magical occurs when the thief, who is not the owner and therefore has no right to transfer ownership, sells the item to B.  Somehow, ownership is transferred from the owner, without their knowledge or consent, to B.
The Dutch approach requires that there is a *legitimate* transfer of ownership, without the consent of the owner.  To me this is immoral.  The US approach has no such requirement.

As of this moment a Bitcoin is worth exactly $14, because this is what people are willing to pay for one.  That is the only criteria by which the value of *anything* can be determined.


Perhaps, perhaps not, so what?


The US government probably considers them to be worth whatever people are willing to pay for them, which as I mentioned, is currently $14 per Bitcoin.  It is not the role or the responsibility of the US government to declare what has "worth" and what does not.  The fact that people are willing to pay for them is what gives them "worth".

Actually, the core of Keynesian belief is that markets aren't always rational.  Anyone who disagrees with this must have slept through the last 4 years.
Keynes claimed that, in particular, the labor market isn't always rational because people *really* *really* don't like to take a pay-cut.  Again, hardly a controversial statement, people *really* don't like pay-cuts, even if the actual market value of their labor has fallen.  The result is increased unemployment because people don't want to take lower-paying jobs.  This is called a recession.
And so, Keynes observed that by printing more money, the government can give the entire country a pay-cut without them really knowing it by reducing the value of money itself.
That is it really.  You are trying to create a strawman that Keynes was some kind of socialist advocating Soviet-style central management.  He wasn't.
He did point out that there were things a government could do during a recession to make it end more quickly and no credible economist would dispute this today, it was the key lesson of the great depression, and has been standard practice ever since.

Sorry, but you don't get to define who is and isn't an advocate for "liberty" according to who you happen to agree with or not.


Another one, this particular variety known as the "guilt by association" fallacy, its a type of ad hominem.
Isn't a more likely explanation that Friedman correctly recognized that there is a role for government to correct some market failings?  Or are you still burying your head in the sand about the fact that markets can fail?
I suppose you think that some government is to blame for the value of Bitcoins dropping from $30 to around half that in the space of a week or two?  Bubbles happen.  Much as libertarians like to find a way to blame governments for every evil, the reality is that bubbles occur in markets and governments frequently have nothing to do with it.


I explained already.  If people were rational they would accept that the market value of labor has dropped, and they would accept a pay-cut.  Unfortunately, people aren't rational and many would rather be unemployed than accept a reduction in pay.
By devaluing the currency you effectively give everyone a stealth pay-cut, thus bringing the cost of labor back in-line with its value and preventing unemployment from increasing dramatically.

It is unfair, but the unfairness is in the fraudulent sale, the thief defrauded you of your money by making you think you were buying something when you weren't, not in the actual owner reclaiming their property.
Ethically, the buyer was wronged by the thief, not the actual owner.  The thief owes the buyer their money back, the actual owner should have no obligation towards the buyer, and it is unfair to force the actual owner to compensate the buyer for the thief's dishonesty.

Not according to [the I2P website](


Also relevant:


The minor distinctions between "garlic" and "onion" routing, as outlined by the I2P site, do nothing to address the fundamental problem with using this style of anonymizing network for using BitTorrent over that kind of network, and all of the reasons Tor discourages it are also valid for I2P.
The fundamental problem is that BitTorrent relies on transferring  bandwidth usage away from a centralized server or servers to "last-mile" bandwidth which is assumed to be abundant and basically free.
But Tor and I2P rely on a limited number of servers to handle the routing, and rather than a single data transfer going directly between peers using only this "free" bandwidth, it must be bounced via several of these limited servers - consuming scarce upstream and downstream bandwidth on each.
So the total bandwidth consumed is 3 times the amount consumed with a normal bittorrent transfer, and most of that bandwidth will be that of the scarce relays, not abundant "last mile" bandwidth.
This is why Tor discourages it, and why I2P would discourage it if they had enough users for it to matter.

What is "property"?  I'd say that property is anything that can be possessed exclusively.  What is possession?  Fundamentally, it is the right to transfer that possession to someone else.  By this metric, Bitcoins are as much property as anything else.  Saying that it must be a physical thing is an arbitrary distinction.


Why is that a necessary property of a commodity?  Gold isn't really "used", in the sense that it is not "used up".  Also, currency and commodity aren't mutually exclusive.  There were times when gold was both a currency and a commodity.


That is largely true of gold too (except, perhaps, for some recent applications in electronics as pointed out elsewhere).


Well, the US government hasn't backed the US dollar since Nixon.  Indeed, since they actually print more dollars all the time, they are constantly undermining the value of dollars.  Bitcoins, on the other hand, can't be printed by some centralized authority, they must be mined and this is hard work.


Gold's applications in microelectronics don't explain why it is valuable, it has been valuable for thousands of years.
I think people like to wear gold *because* it is valuable, it is not valuable *because* people wear it.  Jewelry is primarily a status symbol.  This is why wearing "fake" jewelry is frowned upon, if it was just about appearance, why would that be?

Yeah, understood, but I think "pure" trolls are the greater threat.
I've often experienced pressure from VCs and other members of the management team, but I always make the argument above.  I've been surprised that when you give pushback on patenting they back down quickly because they've almost never really thought about it in-depth, aren't well informed, they're just parroting stuff they heard somewhere from someone.  It's what they think you're "supposed" to do.  I was deeply involved in the fight against software patents in the EU back in 2003-2005 and so I have thought about it and I am well informed.
In short, I've yet to hear a good argument in favor of software patents, even so-called "defensive patents".  It's just cargo cult thinking a lot of the time, egged-on by patent lawyers who have a clear vested interest in more patents.

There isn't really the same concept of "downloading".  You send your request for a piece of a file into the network via a peer that you are directly connected to, and the response comes back.  There is no real way for you to figure out where the data is coming from, nor is there a way for other peers to figure out that you are the requestor.


Nothing, it is assumed that this is a possibility.


Every participant in Freenet is a "server", there is no distinction between client and server in Freenet.

Of course it is, Bitcoin makes no claim that you can run the Bitcoin client and nobody can tell that you are running the Bitcoin client, the same is true of any non-darknet P2P network.


If the Bitcoin client is operating as a Tor hidden service then I find this hard to believe.
The important issue is not whether they can tell that you are running the Bitcoin client, but whether they can tie a specific bitcoin account to your IP address.

Exactly.  Is there any evidence that Kevin isn't simply a victim of selection bias?
To put it another way, while the chances of any specific person would place a bid at such a low price for such a large number of bitcoins may be low, what are the chances that *nobody* would do it?
One thing I'm not clear on: was the bid placed *before* or *during* the turmoil?
*edit:*  The more I think about it, the more I think it was incredibly stupid for MagicalTux to insinuate that Kevin may have been involved, especially based on the very flimsy evidence we've seen so far.  Talk about amateur hour.  If MagicalTux can't present some more concrete evidence than that I'm steering clear of MtGox purely on the basis that its operator would libel someone in that way.
Nonetheless, I don't think Kevin deserves his gains.  Wittingly or unwittingly he is the direct beneficiary of theft, and even though its messy, MtGox is correct to reverse those trades.

I see nothing in the definition of a "commodity" that would preclude Bitcoins from being considered a commodity.  
In particular, I'm unaware of anything that requires that they consist of atoms.  For example, electricity is a type of commodity, yet it is simply a potential difference in charge between two points.
It seems the main qualities of commodities are that:
1. They can be stored - definitely true of Bitcoins
* They are interchangeable, and yes, any 1 Bitcoin is exactly like any other
* Their value is a function of the market as a whole, also true of Bitcoins
* Only one person can own it at any one time, also true of Bitcoins by their design
@_date: 2011-11-24 23:49:17
Nice.  A comment stating the truth gets downvoted, whereas a comment that is *obviously false* to anyone with a brain, but which is what bitcoiners would perhaps like to believe, gets upvoted.

Yes, but to what extent is this because they *know* it is valuable?  Other metals look a lot like gold, yet are much cheaper.
I am quite sure that if gold was as common as, say, copper, you probably wouldn't see as much jewelry made from it.  Jewelry is, to a large extent, a way to advertise wealth.


Right, and this is also true of gold.


This will be interesting.  I think the basis of a legal argument will be that if Bitcoins are illegal, then gold should be illegal too - since the only real difference is that Bitcoins are much more easily transacted than gold.
I think it would be very hard to legislate against Bitcoins without all kinds of unintended consequences.

@_date: 2011-06-21 18:16:10


Its not circular reasoning, and the situations are not symmetrical.  Let's think about it carefully, step by step:
1. To begin with the owner possessed and owned the item
* The thief stole it, so now the thief possesses the item, but the owner still owns it
* The thief, falsely claiming to be the owner, takes money from the buyer and gives possession of the item to the buyer, leading the buyer to **falsely** believe that they are now the owner
* The owner finds the item *which they still own*.  The buyer may initially *believe* they are the owner due to the thief lying to them, but they are wrong, because no transfer of ownership occurred.
* The actual owner has every right to reclaim possession of their property (and under a fair law, they are free to do-so ;)
* The buyer has a right to reclaim their money from the thief, as it was solicited fraudulently.
Yes, it may suck for the buyer, but its not the owner's fault, and its not the owner's problem.
Your perspective is that the thief somehow did cause ownership to be transferred from the original owner to the buyer, even though they were not the owner, and had no right to transfer ownership.  Your perspective is that somehow the buyer's *false belief* that they are the owner, makes them the owner.  
Sorry, but that makes no sense.  No transfer of ownership occurred because the owner never consented to any transfer.  The owner has every right to retake possession of what is still their property, and it is for the buyer to seek redress from the thief, if they can.

Bitcoin transactions are not a secret, and it's not impossible to tie someone to a particular Bitcoin account, but it is possible to make it very difficult to trace money by sending it through a network of relays, such as that used by Silk Road.
Look at the multiple instances where large quantities of Bitcoins have been stolen from Bitcoin early adopters ([example](  Here you have people pretty familiar with how Bitcoin operates, and I'm unaware of any situation where they've been able to track down the thief.

The law really is clear on this subject.  If someone else's property falls into your hands, even as a result of a mistake on their part, *it is still their property and you are stealing it if you refuse to give it back*.


Under US law, and the law of every other country I'm familiar with, it also makes him a thief, plain and simple.


Its "final" in the sense that there is no way to involuntarily reverse a transaction, but that is a separate issue to the legal matter of who owns the bitcoins.  If the guy didn't *voluntarily* send the bitcoins to the other guy then legally they remain his property.  As I've already said, the law is absolutely clear and unambiguous on this.

It is entirely true, Bitcoins aren't instantaneous.
The point is: can you be sure the transaction is safe before you give the customer what they've purchased.
And the reality is that, with Bitcoins, there can be no such assurance within 10-20 minutes, whereas ideally for this type of transaction you'd like confirmation within seconds.
I'm not saying that credit cards are perfect either, but pointing out credit card's flaws doesn't allow us to ignore an obvious flaw in Bitcoins.

Backups, encrypted or otherwise, don't help against the problem of theft, they only help against the problem of accidental loss.

That isn't how the law works.  If it was, then a criminal could sue their local police station for releasing a picture of them in connection with a crime.
Merely disclosing factual information does not make you responsible for what people might do with that information unless the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy, or the website has a duty of care.

Then you are a clueless programmer.  What you describe is impossible.  How can software possibly know that it isn't running on some emulator layer which can manipulate bits at will?
It would require some crazy locked-down "trusted" computing deal, which is wholly incompatible with free software like Bitcoin.
Moreover, even if it was possible, it is hardly a necessary requirement of the Bitcoin software.

Right, and in both cases, if the money or the item can be recovered, they should be returned to their rightful owners.
In our scenario, person A is in the fortunate position of being able to recover their item, and the law should not prevent them from doing so.  The fact that the injustice against person B has not yet been resolved should not justify preventing person A's injustice from being resolved.


Under US law, person B is unjustly deprived of their money **by the thief**.
Under Dutch law, person A is unjustly deprived of their property **by the law**.
The law should not steal from the owner to compensate the buyer.

On the downside, while I'm an enthusiastic Bitcoin user, I'm relatively new to the Bitcoin world (one of my projects, [Freenet]( started accepting Bitcoin donations several months ago).

I think Bitcoins are most closely analogous to gold.
Bitcoins do not have any intrinsic value, except through consensus, and the same is largely true of gold.  
Historically gold doesn't have any intrinsic use.  For example its too soft to make weapons out of it, and there are better and more plentiful alternatives.
Like gold, Bitcoins can be discovered, but also like gold, its hard to do this profitably without specialized equipment and expertise.
Gold is valuable because it has several properties that make it a fairly good currency.  These include:
* Its rare, but not too rare
* Its not dangerous (ie. plutonium - not a good currency)
* Its inert, and doesn't degrade (iron - not a good currency, silver also tarnishes)
* Its easily divisible, because it has a low melting point (why gold is better than platinum)
* Its relatively easy to verify that it is actually gold
While it is true that people like to wear gold, I think this is *because* it is valuable, its not valuable because people like to wear it.
The key point here is that *gold is valuable precisely because it makes a good currency*.  It is only true because there is a consensus that it is true, but this consensus is itself useful to society as a whole as it facilitates smoother transactions.
I think Bitcoins are valuable for exactly the same reason, indeed, Bitcoins are a better currency in many respects than gold is.

What is so special about their requirements?


The systems I work on handle about 1,500 hits per second per server and maintain a 1-3ms response time fairly comfortably - on EC2.

"In recent survey, Moscow Protestant Chaplaincy found that over half of Africans in Moscow had been physically attacked in the past.[30] Attacks in Moscow Metro are common, and “Monkey” insults are so frequent that students have ceased reporting them."
Seriously, if you hate the US so much and think Russia is such an awesome place then you should move there.  Just a few weeks there would shake you out of your shamefully childish naivety.

The police beat up homosexuals in public without recourse in Russia.  They banned gay pride parades for 100 years in Moscow.  Compared to the US it is a **really fucking shitty** place to be an honest person.  
The reality, and this may be difficult for you to accept, but the reality is that the US is simply a much better country to live in, especially if you like to think for yourself.  Looking at the number of Russia-&gt;US immigrants versus those going in the opposite direction will confirm this.
And here's the problem: your favorite TV network is knee-deep in that.

Now, if I want to spend Bitcoins I do so, but at the same time I'll replace what I've spent through Coinbase - so I get to keep riding the rollercoaster.

And they have Dynamo DB and RedShift.  But forgetting all of that, the main advantage of EC2 is that you can provision new servers in minutes, not weeks.  Worst case scenario, all other problems are common to both self-hosting and cloud.


MtGox's problem doesn't seem to be that their instances aren't "fit" enough, it's that it takes them weeks to provision new hardware.  EC2 solves that.




There is no reason that setting up and maintaining hardware should need to be your responsibility except in very rare circumstances.


Vastly more money flows through Amazon than flows through Mt. Gox.  I'd trust Amazon's internal security (with over a decade of experience behind it) over Mt. Gox's home-grown internal security any day.


I promise you that Amazon have far stronger safeguards against that type of thing than whoever hosts Mt. Gox does.

I use it religiously, but then I created it :-)
Seriously though, it works exactly as advertised.  All of my friends use it, so if we did anything evil I'd get my ass kicked.

Can you name one factual inaccuracy in the People's History of the United States?  Just one.


I listen to everything, but I don't trust news outlets just because they tell us how awful the US is.  Have you seen what is going on in Russia right now with respect to gay rights?  Look at RT's coverage - sure, they mention that people don't agree with it, but they treat it like the "gays are degenerates" side of the debate is on equal footing to anyone that thinks that maybe gays are deserving of equal respect.

He said that I don't owe them.

They're incompetent, they don't lie for expressly political purposes (except Fox News).
@_date: 2013-07-27 16:28:56




Then fuck you and your fucked up priorities.
@_date: 2013-07-27 16:02:57


No, the comments I were responding to referred to RT as a "primary source" of news.

And you want to bet the world's future currency on one person's rationality (not that I see why it would be so horrible for him to reveal his identity)?  How is that an improvement on the US dollar?

You do know that Russia Today is a Kremlin propaganda machine, right?  That's not a conspiracy theory, the [Kremlin actually pays for it](
It's worrying when people pat themselves on the back for their skepticism of US media while unquestioningly running into the open arms of Putin's mouthpiece.
@_date: 2013-02-27 12:56:26
That's an interesting idea, we'll think about it.
@_date: 2013-03-03 15:58:29
We have ways to detect and block that.

In other words, when you agree with them you believe what they say.  That's a great way to confirm your pre-existing beliefs, and a terrible way to discover the truth.

And how much is the two-week delay in obtaining additional servers costing them?  You need to be operating at pretty serious volume for that cost-benefit to work out in favor of self-hosting.


Which is why you can outsource that also (perhaps Amazon Dynamo, or RDS).


Most but not all.  Regardless, almost anything you can run locally, you can outsource.


Clearly self-hosting isn't working out so well for them.

They need to earn their validity, they aren't presumed valid.


What if the way you see the world is wrong, and if it is, how would you ever know?
What is ever going to challenge your views if you dismiss anything that disagrees with your pre-existing world view while listening to anything that supports it, even when you know it has an ulterior motive?
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:07:28
Are you being sarcastic?  I hope so.

Coinbase is like using a Mac, MtGox is like using Linux.  Actually, that probably understates it, Coinbase is so much more pleasant, both to get set up with, and to use.
Best thing about Coinbase is that they lock-in the price of the Bitcoins you buy immediately, even though the bank transfer takes several days.  This removes the disincentive not to spend Bitcoins - if I spend them I just immediately replace them at the current price via Coinbase.

If that is what he is saying then why didn't he say it?  At no point did he say that they sent me more bitcoins than they should have.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:18:57
That statement is ambiguous.  It could be interpreted as:

Like I said elsewhere, I'm going to need to hear an explanation far more convincing than anecdotal evidence before I accept any of this stuff.
@_date: 2013-07-27 04:12:47
What makes it real and/or valid?  The fact that it confirms your preconceptions?

How will they be sure it won't be vulnerable to forged banknotes?

My argument is that the entire currency could be tanked through the actions of anonymous people that would have zero accountability for doing it.  That's true of Satoshi, and those early adopters that also may control a vast number of those coin.
I'm sorry if you don't like that idea, I guess that I assumed bitcoin enthusiasts would have better critical thinking skills :-/

That's a good point on the EUR thing :-)  Can you suggest a better jquery to use?
ps. LastCalc is completely open source.  If you know any Java we are looking for people to help out with it.

Can you be more specific?
We do have algorithms designed to detect and block this kind of abuse, and so far they've been quite effective.  We continue to improve them.
