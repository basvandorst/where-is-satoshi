I am never going to use this shit after I've seen the devs argue and act like 7 year olds and deleting comments on guthub when they were called out for a privacy concern (transmiting public keys over wifi in clear text) that they refused to address and fix. Not sure if it has been fixed now.

You might want to read up about coinomi first. They are advertising as an open source multi coin wallet, but the last release on github is from like 2016.... I am not bothered by them being not open source any more, but they keep advertising it as one. 
**Also**, after I've seen the developer reacting like a 7 year old when a guy published privacy breach bug (public keys being broadcasted over the air in clear text) that they refused to fix for god knows how long, I am not planing to use their service ever again.

they refused to fix the bug for god knows how long, and the guy decided he gave them enough time and spread it publicly, hoping to get them to fix it asap. They since deleted all the snarky comments and removed the github issue

did any of the articles actually specify in which block are all those images supposedly located, or are they just larping without proof?

no, but paper wallet generating websites running ads are considered vulnerable since they are running third party scripts.
Also, rogue/phishing websites that are used to generate keys are also one way to get your funds stolen

will I get 2 different coins again if they actually end up splitting like I did with August 1st split?

use bitcoin atm, pretty much the easiest solution
