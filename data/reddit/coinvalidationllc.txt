Get the Pheeva wallet app. Just go here
And click "join our trial program." You'll get an email with a link to download an ACTUAL NATIVE iOS app, not a webapp.
Pheeva is cleverly using Apple's own guidelines against them. By signing up for the "trial program," you become a member of a private organization. Apple allows private organizations to distribute to its members apps that otherwise would be removed from the public App Store.
Very clever.
