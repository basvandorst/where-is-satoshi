no it doesn't. it relies on android to keep other apps from accessing your wallet file. if someone gets access to your phone they can either root the device or just mount the file system on some other device and read your wallet file that way.

This all seems exaggerated. DB isn't that big that it could sink Germany and China.

bitcoin was released in 2009 but development started well before that. and as others have pointed out it has its roots in even earlier developments by other people.

   length of seed phrases is standardized to 12 words, using 132 bits
   of entropy (including 2FA seeds). In the wizard, the type of the
seed is displayed in the seed input dialog.
Wow this is big! Different length seed phrases were a source of confusion for many users. The ability to add seed phrase passwords is also a great feature.

yeah but they are negligible in the grand scheme of things. once you have bitcoins you can cheaply send them anywhere.  it's the currency conversion that gets you (either fiat to other fiat or fiat to btc). and in most countries banks have a monopoly on cheap currency conversion so you invariably have to use their services.

ssh can output an ascii art representation of public keys. Perhaps that could be adapted to bitcoin addresses?
