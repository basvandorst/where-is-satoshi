And hello other fellow North Carolinian!

The same thing the OS/2 bowl meant for IBM.

Yup, that's it, "bitchin".  I'd like to pay for this with my bitchiness.

That is a thorough answer!

In America, and I hope other places too, always, always use your [Safe Trade Locations]( anytime you meet to buy or sell anything from an individual you don't know.

No, that is [Vint Cerf]( though Vint may be Chairman of the Board and Tim might be CEO.  I'm not sure.

Someone printed and put that in my cube after my first Sun SpacStation 10 arrived.  Hard to believe how long ago that was.

Come over for a beer anytime fellow UNIX guy.  We can shout at young people while rocking on the porch.

I couldn't agree more.  Something about the Pi hit just the right spot.  They are fantastic boards.. I am looking at two on my desk right now: a Model B with a PiGlow running [ISS Above]( and Pi 2 running some X apps, scripts, whatever.  In fact, [here they are](

I hardly see the Raspberry Pi as being 'hipster'.  I'm either a recluse, a misanthrope or a hermit and I don't really want to know which one so I can't say I use the Pi because of its fashion.  
A 15 year old PIII would provide plenty of power, yes, but it would also.  The Pi has plenty of power depending on what you want it to do.  If you want it to be a fully functional desktop, no, I couldn't recommend that.  Personally I feel that learning a new programming language on a board with limited power and resources is a good idea.  It's too easy to write sloppy code that is able to hide in multiple gigs of RAM and four or more cores.
The Arduino and Teensy boards are very compelling and I will likely go that route if I ever need more GPIO pins.  At this point the Pi is the devil I know and we get along so I'm going to stick with it until I have a reason to go another route.

You helped write sendmail?  Recently or back in the day?  It's very interesting either way.
If you are burning cpu for extra cycles in an effort of security that is an argument I can get behind.  i will stand behind my claim that something like a Pi makes good sense to learn programming because of its limited resources.  If, say, in Python, you learn a more efficent way to search through a large file isn't that a good thing?  
Also, consider this.  A home computer is now something that parents may not want a child to get creative with for fear of losing tax files, etc, etc, etc.  If a child is interested with programming or hardware I think a Pi is a great choice.  Blow it up or learn the hard way what 'sudo rm -rf /' does then reflash it and start over.  Screw up a breadboard and you are out a $35 board.  
I still think the Pi has a place.  Once someone grows past the Pi's capabilities there are plenty of other options depending if you want to be a hardware or software hobbiest but either way I think the Pi is a great place to start on that journey.

I have some $1 Silver Certs... somewhere.  Neat!  I haven't seen a $5 one in a very, very long time.  Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:11:23
Very cool!

I am interested.  American, FWIW.

This is the correct response.

I've been around a while too, am in my late 40's.  I hope America can survive but after the last two GOP presidents I am worried about the future (and the direction that party is taking).
