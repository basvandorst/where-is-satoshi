Oh cool thanks! I missed this one :)
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:11:52
Ah! Ok, understood now. But that's only for Bitcoin-the-currency application, blockchain can be moving other things than money :)

Kind of, Fintech Innovation Labs, by Accenture

Thx for the tip :)

Haha :)
Yeah, of course, but it's very hard to explain Blockchain to people, especially when it's not just the Bitcoin Blockchain. I think it's pretty good though, for one sentence!

You have to trust the printer too :) (most have memory)

That's all, didn't have time to chat afterwards. Happened in Dublin this morning, during a Fintech accelerator round-table discussion. We are one of the companies in the accelerator and I had 30 sec to answer what "innovation for banks" could be. I explained how Blockchain (kinda have to ban the word "Bitcoin" when talking to bankers for now, if you want to keep their attention), can change the way Finance works.
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:06:56
And there are some free transactions, if you want to be exact :)
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:46:05
more like "drugs". But the cool thing is that when they hear "blockchain" they are like kids at Christmas.
It's an awareness problem, it will change over time, when the media start saying good things about Bitcoin. The Microsoft announcement is a great step in that direction.

Open Source doesn't mean you should blindly trust the stuff. Audit it yourselves or ask for independent audits if you don't have the knowledge.
Open Source =/= secure

If it's offchain, why mining?
@_date: 2015-05-19 00:11:27
It WILL cost you more to mine. Just because your battery is less efficient than a miner plugged on the wall. You can buy an "efficiently" mined BTC for cheaper than mining yourself, and that will always be true.
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:56:16
It doesn't "have" to cost money. I'd avoid "private key" in a casual conversation, but it is indeed an important factor.
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:54:39
Can someone explain to 21 that more miners doesn't mean more Bitcoin? They will just divide the block reward between, well, everybody in the world. Great job. At the cost of battery life. For no benefit for the user.

Cool! Check out BTCfob.com for NFC keychains, instead of QR code.  :)

If mining is profitable, companies will use specific hardware in specific places. Thus 21 (and your 21 enabled devices) won't get a share.
If mining is not even profitable for dedicated miners, then it will be horribly bad in your phone for example, costwise (efficiency from a battery). I mean, let's say 7Bn devices, that's 0.01ct per day at today's price. Even if Bitcoin go 100 fold, it's only 1ct per day per device, if all miners are equal. Just for the data connection required to mine, you will consume much, much more power than that.
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:09:20
Yes, but that's not what they do. They waste the energy by putting it in your watch/phone/even fridge.
@_date: 2015-05-19 00:07:13
If too low to be noticed, the gain will be even smaller as it cannot be profitable.
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:07:00
Why using Bitcoin in that case, they should just have a sidechain. They completely forget the transaction fee in their model. 
IMHO, they have no clue what they are doing.
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:42:25
Ah? Any contradiction?
@_date: 2015-04-01 10:12:05
Yep! :) It's just a memory chip, it has no "smart" capability. You can store whatever data you want, it doesn't even have to be a bitcoin address.
As long as you don't ask us to lock it (which put the chip in read only), you can erase the memory and write it again, with any NFC app.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:19:01
Yep, lemme try to change that :)
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:21:12
Done! it should work now
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:27:01
Thank you! The Vaults are hand-made we need to work more on the pricing given the time it takes to make them, maybe we will go for a new design all-together.
Glad you like it though!
