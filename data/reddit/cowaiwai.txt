Google translate is not really good. Would you mind giving some bullet points?
Was he targetted as a high net worth person? I'm pretty sure I did not read about any ransom having been paid? Did he get out of this unhurt?

He didn't.

I did not put this option into my list as I was talking about the kind of robbers that drug and kill you anyway. Only with multisig wallet can you make sure that a co-signer requires your safety in exchange for money.

How to protect against a $5 wrench attack, if the criminals are determined to drug and beat you a week to kill you anyway?
* Use multisig
* Don't be public about your holdings
* Don't share your security protocol
* Have a security protocol
* Make it clear to the kidnappers that the prize on their heads is higher than what they can physically get from you.
* Maybe support initiatives that aim to reduce the reward for Pavel Lerner's kidnappers (How are decentralized prediction markets coming along?)
* A distress wallet doesn't cut it, as the guys kill you anyway and will torture you assuming you gave them a distress wallet even if you didn't. This is where the "drug and beat you a week to kill you anyway" part comes in.
* A time-locked wallet won't help you as the guys might not believe you or they only extend the hostage situation until the time lock expires. To kill you then.

"$1mil wasn't only his private money"
Which $1mil?? I don't speak Russian. Those are details I can't pull from the link you provided.

This is ridiculous. Ok, I've seen it before and I'm somewhat familiar with the numbers but scrolling down to the last block … lol, seriously?

Hmm, interesting website. I was about to rant against coinbase wallet being top, claiming it was no actual wallet but more a banking interface but it seams that with their optional "vault" you can use it as a wallet, too, which makes it ambiguous.
But Xapo, Circle Pay and ￼Bitcoin Smart Wallet seam to fall into this no-wallet category.

If people like you are the target audience, I might lack the intellectual capacities to appreciate the achievement.

This is an awesome form of protest and proofs the power of the sheeplies.
I don't know what exactly the fuzz is about they are protesting for and I won't endorse litecoin or buttcoin as subs but for the sake of getting this form of protest visibility I would support to go private, too.
We do have power and tools to protest when those huge services that form a monopoly thanks to network effect do bad things. People share on their facebook that they don't agree with the TOS changes while they actually have the power to protest by pulling the plug on their popular pages.

providing an app - even if it is open source - as an anonymous entity is a big red flag for me. them bragging about their privacy (which is poor as greg explains) and their edgy slogan look to me like they aim for gullible people and will pull the rug once the funds managed by the app stop increasing.
open source doesn't mean that anybody would verify that your app on your phone actually is what they share on github and even if it would, hiding wallet stealing features in plain sight is rather trivial if the project is more than 100 custom lines of code or uses some library that might be under control of the attacker, too.
