~500 BTC wall on Bitstamp. But we'll get there. :D

Still having the same problem. Nice to know you guys are on it.
*edit* I've also noticed when I log in, it says "updating identifier" on the top right, after a few seconds it says there was an error updating.

Roses are red, Violets are blue, I love Bitcoin and so do you!
*Thanks for doing this 'definitely_in_doubt', you are the definition of friendliness in the Bitcoin community*

Got the same email. My password is only about a month old though. A little nervous to change my password and respond to the email. Any updates Idny99?

I know right. If your going to go through the effort to do something like this, at least write correctly: "Hello everyone! and apologize for the delays and lack of communication are currently working on some design improvements / server."

I'm in the same boat. 
I do know the UK said there not going to tax trading profits though.

I live in Chile and the charge is 2.5%. A lot different from the 20% spoken about in Colombia.

It's a sad thing, but I agree. This can only hurt the Bitcoin community and create more turmoil amongst its now/future users. 
However, I do see light at the end of the tunnel. Now, that we know what mistakes have been made, we can grow and hopefully learn from them.

Yeah, I rofl'd!

Matt Miller seems a bit stupid most of the time. But at least he is interested and wants Bitcoin to go somewhere. I can like him for that.

A security flaw. If someone can hack it, it will disappear.

[Swarm]( is off to a great start and the future is looking pretty bright for them.

Yes. The first time I saw it I thought it was strange too. But it normally happens at least twice a day. It's always small amounts and typically about 50 buys or sells.

Don't worry, you're not crazy. I blew a few grand on bitcoin in 2011 and my wife flipped. She's pretty happy now though. :)
Let me add a small portion to your total $1 @_date: 2015-04-06 16:50:56

Swarm - Changing governance and finance. Epic!

Not at all, they're working on the DCO model. Will completely change ownership. The voting was just a step.

It makes sense the the 4 emails were for the 4 votes. Not sure why everyone else is missing this. Also, I can vote for Bruce Fenton just fine. Same address as posted.
