In the same sense it is the private key that actually owns the bitcoins at an address. The rules imply that knowledge of the private key is the only requirement for ownership.

What the fuck do American ideas/institutions have to do with a global ledger that's secured by miners primarily based in China?

Just hard fork once you've tricked the dirty bankers by selling for a profit. This is how we the people will turn the tables.

Selling makes sense when the price is likely to decrease further.

51% attacks enable double spend attacks and are clearly allowed by the rules.

I'm disappointed that the response was mostly downvotes, then exaggerated dismissals, then change of topic. I'm just an engineer trying to understand the problem space.

What are the many things that have changed? I’m asking for my own information.

Or just closed network without a non\-authenticated public endpoint?
According to the paper it takes only a small fraction of total hashrate to succeed.
\(My point is they don't need to be physically colocated to collude and exclude strangers.\)

My hand\-wavy take at a glance is that it works like this:
When a pool discovers a block they can keep that solved block private and not publish it.
If the pool has a private chain longer than the public chain, they can publish the private chain to
invalidate all the work done by the honest miners. Even worse, once they have a lead, they continue mining
on the private chain, only publishing just enough to invalidate the public chain when needed.
This allows the pool mining on the private chain to take more than their share of the reward than their
actual combined computing power would return if they mined honestly.
Any experts care to comment?

I hadn't heard of "spy mining", thank you. It's an interesting countermeasure but I have some lingering questions. If a pool \(say an ASIC manufacturer\) had all of the hardware running on a closed network, spy mining wouldn't be feasible would it?

How do you measure number of BTC users? One user can create millions of wallets.

When the economy is on the brink what people really want is to sink their savings into a speculative asset controlled by a small cabal of early adopters and fiat-gateway controllers.

I’m not sure LN makes such a big difference at this point but ok.
