But is Reddit gold better than real gold?

While I agree with everything you said, I'd add that using the judgement of the majority of well educated or professional people as a datapoint is something to be taken in moderation. While it's good to have a certain amount of personal idea-inertia so that you're not misled by accidentally taking on extreme views that you'd later agree are unreasonable and regret having had, it's also good to maintain a certain amount of idea-mobility so you're not just listening to majority opinion to tell you everything you know. 
This might appear to be an obvious point, but there are those who would say that one shouldn't take the numbers and intelligence/expertise of people holding a certain view as evidence at all but rather develop good thinking skills in oneself and then decide what one thinks on one's own. These people have far too much faith in their ability to be objective given that all their views and the very way they think is so influenced by the cultures, on various scales, in which they live. As a Western European university student I'm going to think very differently to an Indian CEO, because we have different upbringings with different types of people around us, so there is no point from which either of us can judge things 'without bias'.
On the other hand, there are those who completely take on the mentality of those around them. Those who do this consciously or explicitly are few and far between in Western society because we like to think of ourselves as individualistic, but those who do this unconsciously aren't so rare, and should question and examine the claims of the dominant paradigms they're immersed in. That doesn't mean rejecting these ideas outright as soon as an alternative is called to their attention in order to feel like they're 'thinking for themselves'. It means holding themselves in uncertainty and doubt for as long as possible, because it's the most fun intellectual state to be in anyway, and then slowly coming up with an internal system that keeps their 'in-sanity' in and their 'out-sanity' in the social sphere where they can continue to be accepted.

You sound like you're in a bad mood. Are you okay?

Your cash doesn't lose a cent relative to itself, but it does lose purchasing power. Bitcoin has beaten year on year inflation every single year since it started.

When I read this sub, my inner voice pronounces them 'embits' and 'mubits', but 'millis' and 'micros' sounds better. I'd love to pay for something in micros.
'Hey, how many micros does that cost?' 
So futuristic.

Even if you agree with him, you have to agree that that's statism, that is to say, advocacy for state intervention. Unless you take 'statism' to mean something pejorative or to do with an oversized, paternalistic state rather than any state at all, which are both interpretations I've heard before. So it might just be that you and are operating with different definitions.

Maybe that's why. It shows you need them more than they need you. How about treating them as total equals, as if you don't *need* them at all?

Where we're going, we don't need dollars. Even 20k of them.
