from what I can tell there are 2 types of people on this sub. The Bulls who only post positive things so that the price will go up and they can get rich, and the Bulls who say negative things to get people to sell and the price will go down, so that they can buy more and get rich.

How will it leave people behind? They will be able to convert their FIAT currency to bitcoin at the rate it is worth at that time. A completely fair swap. They are only "left behind" if you mean in terms of a get rich quick type situation. Or if you are thinking FIAT will crash and burn.

Yeah, the dude doesn't know what a business day is. Not Kraken's fault. If you bought on Friday December 1st, you won't get it in the account til Tues. December 19th. That is 12 business days.

I was upset that I hadn't received the Bitcoin I purchased from Coinbase, but then I took the time to actually read the website and the time it took falls in the 5-12 business days they state it will take for my type of transaction. If I were to be mad at the time it takes to process, I should be mad at the banks or the blockchain, not the exchange.

I bought some because it's better than it sitting making .01% interest annually.

These charities will sell as soon as receiving, will this not cause a drop massive drop in market value?

They don't have huge, easily accessible, oil reserves. They have lots of oil, but it is in tar sands and other such deposits which are not economical to produce unless the price per barrel is probably double what it is now.

lol we've seen 5k twice in the last 2 weeks, things are still going down before they go up my friend. Bitcoin is manipulated, when you see the majority of the opinion on Reddit be bullish, the price tanks, because people are selling into the dumb money. Same with December pump. Bullish everywhere. People purchased bitcoin on coinbase, but didn't receive it for a couple weeks. So the majority of the bitcoin being bought by new users, was not liquid. Less supply to buy because they are locked up thanks to slow banking transactions and clogged blockchain network. Futures trading released at the same time. So here you had people with knowledge of the market, and the capital to control the price in a low liquidity market. They knew that the bubble would pop, because they were going to be the ones to pop it. Any amount they lost selling their coins, they made up for in their short. And they knew that they could do all of this, because every possible crypto news source told people to "move their coins into a hardware wallet, away from exchanges (so they cannot sell it), and to HODL, because once again, they won't be selling it. If they wanted to sell it, they would have to transfer it back from wallet to exchange, wait a while, and by the time your coins are on an exchange to sell, the smart money is already done with their move.

in the case of last december, a bunch of people signed up for coinbase after seeing the price rise like this and it took 2 weeks for them to get the funds deposited, during that 2 weeks the price sky rocketed, and those people said fuckit, i put my money in anyways, might as well buy it at this price, and the price skyrocketed some more. Big bags saw this happening, drove up price more, the last stragglers of coinbase bought in at ATH, then dump city
