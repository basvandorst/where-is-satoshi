Not really, you'd want precious metals for a Revolution-style apocalypse. For a zombie apocalypse, where all trade has collapsed, you'd want canned food, bottled water and guns. You can't eat gold, nor is it a particularly effective weapon for killing zombies.
In a real apocalypse, the only things that have inherent value are those things which preserve and continue life. Gold and such only have inherent value in the context of a functioning economy.

While it's a bit controversial as an actual method of diagnosis the [Autism Spectrum Quotient]( is still a fairly good tool that is commonly used for self-diagnosis.
It's far from perfect but it has a reasonably high success rate and in the case that it leads previously undiagnosed individuals toward proper diagnosis and treatment I can't see the fault in it.

That's because testnet doesn't need community support. It's an identical but separate Bitcoin network - same thing, different blockchain. Since no one transacts business on testnet the coins don't have any real value and since they have little to no value, no one mines them so difficulty stays low. You can even run your own testnet-in-a-box with your own separate blockchain that only you mine or transact on. All you should need help with is setup, after which everything else is the same. Mining is the same, transactions are the same, the software is the same, the errors and their resolutions will be the same.
TL;DR: Testnet doesn't need support because it's functionally identical to Bitcoin, which already has it.

Exactly like speeding. There are tons of studies showing that speed limits are a very poor safety measure.
Turns out, it's less about your objective speed and more about your speed relative to traffic. Within reason, driving fast/slow isn't dangerous, driving faster/slower than everyone else is. 
Speed limits, being entirely unsupported by actual evidence, are therefore tantamount to an additional tax on driving.

There is a specific value used in Bitcoin's ECDSA math that should be different each time a key is used. If that value is ever duplicated you can use it to reverse engineer the private key. 
There was a flaw in Android's built-in RNG that made it generate less-than-random numbers, duplicating numbers in that field quite often. 
You had to be a bit unlucky to lose coins from that one, but it did hit a lot of people before the Android wallets switched to a better RNG.

Once upon a time I worked for Verifone. If you think Bitcoin is complex, you should try learning the low-level protocols used for VISA/MC transactions. Bitcoin is actually startlingly elegant, especially by comparison to the horrible arcane protocols we're using now.

Pretty sure the computation and memory intensive nature of BIP38 and (properly implemented) scrypt is intentional. PBKDF2 is vulnerable to acceleration via GPUs, for example, and as it happens there are a LOT of Bitcoiners who have these in abundance.
Yes, PBKDF2 is tunable, yes there are ways to skirt the issue and delay a break, but at the end of the day it's fundamentally weak to readily-obtainable equipment that a huge proportion of this community already has in their garage collecting dust. BIP38 isn't complex and slow unnecessarily, it's complex and slow intentionally.

Typically, there is little difference between a paper wallet and a paper backup. In deterministic systems like Electrum the backup is likely of a seed rather than individual private keys, but they're fundamentally similar.
The primary difference is that the only way to get money off a paper wallet is to sweep its keys into another system, typically one connected to the 'net like a smartphone, which means it's not really "cold" any more and the key(s) should be discarded after use, requiring you to make and then load another wallet. While you're making and loading the 2nd wallet, you may have far too many BTC sitting on your phone or desktop, vulnerable to theft. Paper storage is secure, paper sweeping is usually less so.
With proper cold storage, a math-capable offline system signs transactions with your keys which may then be moved to an online system for broadcast. In this way we may sign transactions without any online system knowing our keys, which makes them multi-use capable.
In such systems the backup is only meant to be used in case of emergency. It's inconvenient, but it's ok because it's only a backup measure. With a paper wallet the "backup" is all you've got.

Spend the time to move your coins, it's worth it.

Directly from wikipedia, since you cited it first:


Is it a bit of a fractured group beyond that limited definition? Sure, but that's what you get when your primary ideology is personal liberty: a bunch of people making their own choices by their own standards, who will probably disagree with each other on a number of fine points - but importantly, will fight to the death for your right to disagree with them. There are many other groups that all but prohibit free individual thought have a clearly defined "party line" on nearly every issue, sustained by highly-prevalent groupthink. It's hard to have a party line on every issue when your primary party lines are "you should get to draw your own lines" and "groupthink is bad."
Also, if you left wikipedia thinking that the above definition correctly reduces to "I like personal freedom and dislike corruption" you need to go back, click some of the links in that paragraph and read what the terms actually mean. Even if we pretend that you didn't ignore half of the paragraph, politics (like science) often uses words under different definitions than the same words have in common use. (Science example: Theory vs Hypothesis)
There is also a degree of historical nuance in the English language that is lost on most modern humans but was quite important to those who drafted America's defining documents. Take the etymology of both "freedom" and "liberty" for example...
The Saxon root : German Freiheit -&gt; Freedom.
The Norman root : French Liberté -&gt; Liberty.
As in other occurrences of this double origin, there is a subtle distinction of freedom being more an everyday thing (because words from Saxon origin were preferred by common people) and liberty a more institutional thing (because Norman words were preferred by the ruling class).
So the "freedom" you've reduced libertarianism to is "the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint." Which would include, for example, the freedom for me to stab someone in the face repeatedly and does not address the government's role at all. This isn't what we want.
Liberty, on the other hand is "the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views." This directly addresses the government's role and is limited to only oppressive restrictions. As long as we can all agree that none of us should have the right to stab each other in the face, such a restriction would not qualify as oppressive. This is the correct word.
So even if we ignore the components of political freedom, voluntary association and don't bother to go see what authoritarianism is (you can learn a lot about things by studying their opposites) - even if we ignore the entire remainder of the article and the whole complex body of political work that properly defines libertarianism - even if we ignore everything but the dictionary definition, your reduction is still incorrect.
It takes a lot more than one sentence to define libertarianism, or any real political ideology. If your entire political ideology can be summed up in a sentence, you either haven't thought it through adequately or you're some kind of prescient political god capable of wrapping our grossly complex world and all of its edge cases into a dozen words or less.
Of course all of this is not to say that Bitcoin, and specifically, don't have a political lean - they do. There are a lot of Libertarians, voluntaryists, cryptoanarchists, cypherpunks etc here and sometimes that can make for a hostile environment if you don't agree with their views - which is especially bad when you consider that their own ideologies should prohibit them from trashing you over your own ideologies. This discussion doesn't change that, it's merely an invitation to actually understand an ideology before critiquing it.

Actually, pretending to have complex security methods is what they do.
To be fair, the systems are indeed complex and these companies do abstract that complexity, but they certainly aren't complex for security reasons. Rather, they are complex because most of these systems predate modern security and data encoding concepts, none of them speak the same language and most haven't been meaningfully updated since the dawn of computing. 
What actually happens is roughly as complex a security problem as submitting an html form over https, and about as secure: If the channel (or any system involved in the transaction) is comprised, everything is.
**Edit:** *It appears, from the downvotes, that some of you are reading these as the words of a rabid Bitcoiner foaming at the mouth about the evils of... whatever. I feel, in this light, that it would be constructive to mention that I've been saying these things since before Bitcoin existed. See, I used to work for Verifone in a high-level technical capacity and have, for example, manually processed a credit card transaction - by which I mean "constructed it in a hex editor and sent it via telnet."

If you're only ever going to spend from that fund come college time, it is currently much easier to split up a key than to make an M of N address. 
For example, you could split up the 12 words of an electrum seed into 3 parts (4 words each) and store them as follows:
Your kid: parts 1 and 2
Your safe: parts 2 and 3
Your safe deposit box: parts 1 and 3
You'll need 2 of 3 sets to recover the wallet, so your kid can't spend without you, and the redundancy makes it harder to lose coins. The fact that each set is missing 1/3 of the key also makes it harder to steal.

Well when you reduce the argument to that level of simplicity it does seem absurd, but there are plenty of people whose politics are against personal freedom, even if they don't realize it.
The argument would seem less absurd if every "I support &lt;city&gt; police" bumper sticker actually said "I'm ok with people in fancy uniforms using violence to limit my freedoms, as long as they can convince more than half of voters it's for their own good."

The value of Bitcoin is largely derived from the utility of the network, which itself is largely derived from simple adoption and use. If you have the opportunity to buy bitcoins, then buy them. But if you have the opportunity to participate in this new marketplace you can not only increase your wallet's balance but also increase the amount of value that balance represents.
Right now Bitcoin's value is largely speculative, but the crazy price tags people keep putting on BTC's future don't come from that speculation, they come from the increase in that underlying utility. We won't get there with bubbles, whales and algo trading, we'll get there with pizza shops and taxicabs and maybe even humble little online electronics stores.
TL;DR: Buying Bitcoins is a smart idea, participating in the Bitcoin marketplace is a smarter one.

The problem is actually dual-pronged in nature. There were problems with weakly-generated keys but there was also a problem with one of ECDSA's internal values - oh-so-helpfully labeled "k" - being duplicated:
To compute a signature of a message m, we compute:
r = (g^k mod p) mod q (where k is a randomly chosen value)
s = k^−1 ( H ( m ) + xr ) mod q (where H is a hash function)
The signature is then (r,s) and the big problem is in potential collisions of r, which can happen if the RNG generates the same k twice.
And of course, if you're interested, [the full writeup of both problems](

Lawsky hadn't actually published anything at the time. A lot of us were hoping regulation would be sane and were disappointed by what actually came out, Shrem included. 
As for what Shrem actually did, he sold bitcoins to a guy (not illegal) who was using silk road (not illegal) to sell Bitcoins for green dot cards. This last part, selling for green dot cards, is the only part that's actually illegal... And it wasn't illegal when Charlie was involved - it became illegal after FinCEN, at which point BitInstant ceased operations to deal with those new regulations anyway. 
Now Faiella, who kept on operating post-FinCEN, is another story. He's way screwed. 
Simply because it happened on silk road does not make something illegal. You're allowed to open a legit business in a bad neighborhood, right?

That one is likely to take a loooong time. As a former (but long-time) gaming employee it's been my experience that no matter your job, on every single rung of the gaming ladder, your biggest time-sink (and money-sink) is always getting Nevada Gaming Commission (NGC) approval. I have no doubt the casinos would love to let you gamble with it - they're typically happy to take anything of value - but the NGC will likely make Vegas gambling halls the LAST adopters. The NGC is so slow and old I can see the IRS letting you pay taxes with Bitcoin before the NGC will let you wager with it...
Now tribal casinos may be a different story. I've held licenses in 30+ jurisdictions and while some of them are just as horrid (or worse) there are others that have extraordinarily lax restrictions. I would expect tribal properties to adopt long before Vegas, sadly.

It violates no physical laws for my atoms to spontaneously disassemble, move one foot to the left and reassemble - it's just so horrendously unlikely that it's absurd to even imagine it occurring. Does pointing out the unlikeliness of this event "make it crazier when it happens?"
Oh wait, it never has and never will. This is because spontaneous human teleportation is so incredibly unlikely that even though it has a chance of occurring at least once per planck time it never has and never will simply because its rarity is still miniscule even multiplied across the entire lifespan of the universe. Address collisions are in this same category.
As a matter of fact, a collision of truly random addresses in 2^256 keyspace is so rare that if it ever does occur it should be considered an indicator that your entropy source is completely broken (i.e. that neither key is actually random). It should also be an indicator that you should buy lottery tickets, because the odds of finding a key collision are significantly lower than winning the lottery - all of them - forever.
As if the sheer rarity of such an event weren't adequate to ease your mind, it also happens that any computer massive enough to even attempt such a futile search would make dramatically more coin by simply turning that power towards mining.
Even ignoring profitability, if random key search had any real chance of working, Bitcoin would be completely broken since there are always entities for whom damaging Bitcoin is more important than mere money.

Because paper wallets aren't necessarily cold storage. Cold storage means the signing is done by an offline device, paper wallets are merely offline key storage. 
This isn't to say that they're bad, but one typically decrypts the bip38 key on a hot device, meaning there is a brief window in which a compromised device can result in a theft.

As one example: It's relatively easy to make a microprocessor behave like a USB HID and send keystrokes or mouse movements to a computer - it's so easy and cheap to do that ThinkGeek [sells such a device]( for $9 to prank your coworkers.
If I install such a device in a USB hub or sneak one into your mouse, I own your system no matter what OS you've got installed, no matter what LiveCD you booted from - I've got a remote keyboard physically attached to your computer. I have physical access. Game over.
Do you completely trust the chain-of-custody of every device that's plugged into your computer right now? Neither do I.
The only way to completely control physical access security breaches is to have an entirely separate self-contained system which is stored securely between access, never left unattended, etc.
Yes, someone could pre-infect your cheap netbook before it's shipped to you, but that's quite a bit harder to pull off than pwning a system most of us leave completely unattended for at least half the day, take with us when we travel, plug into questionable chargers at conventions, etc. Interdiction in transit is usually the sort of thing government agencies do, not people intent on stealing your bitcoins or bank information.
Is my level of paranoia too high? Maybe. Depends on how much you've got to lose and how risk-averse you are. There is no one-size-fits-all solution here, some people will always require/desire more or less security.
It's more that LiveCD fills a niche that I don't see existing. For the amount of money I'd feel safe storing on a LiveCD-based wallet, I'll just use a BIP38 card. Most LiveCD implementations are warm wallets anyway.
I personally keep varying amounts in a hot, warm and cold wallet for convenience reasons. YMMV.

They've never harmed anyone? My facebook notifications/timeline beg to differ. The game companies they regularly rip off seem like pretty solid candidates for "harm" as well given that they're directly financially impacted by the blatant theft of their intellectual property...
Their games are also intentionally designed to be addictive, some of them are little more than thinly veiled skinner boxes. The "energy" system is explicitly designed to make you play at regular intervals rather than obsessively play until you run out of content, thus ensuring that their horrid games become a part of your daily routine.
Their "share everything with your friends" mechanic was so disruptive that facebook had to change the entire way their notification system worked - I'm sure that cost a fair amount of unnecessary money.
Or instead of my rambling, how about this lovely quote from one of their former devs:


Their business model isn't controversial - there's no actual controversy taking place - it's a model that favors short-term financial gain so heavily that it's running the company into the ground and taking large swathes of the industry with it. Zynga steals, lies, intentionally makes their products addictive and hurts others for personal gain. How is that not evil?
**Edit:** *To be fair, a lot of games are intentionally addictive and I don't like it in World of Warcraft any more than I like it in *Ville. It's an unfortunate dark side to the industry that nearly every game company participates in to some extent, but Zynga does it more and better than anyone else.*

It's technically not a fake certificate, it's a perfectly valid certificate, it's just issued to all domains on-demand by a non-standard CA which your IT department has directly ordered your (their) computer to trust. They have this ability because they are the administrators of that machine, not you. This is because they own the machine, not you. If an attacker wanted to do this in the wild, to a computer that you own and administer, they'd either need to have rights to add a new CA to your system (and if they have that you're already compromised) or they'd have to somehow get a real CA to sign a "valid" SSL cert for a domain they don't own. HTTPS MITM is easy enough, it's getting a modern browser to accept a fake certificate that's the problem.

The fundamental misunderstanding here is that you're not sending coins, you're generating transaction outputs. 
Every transaction has some number of inputs. Almost universally these consist of the outputs of previous transactions. In this way transactions are chained one after another. 
There is no rule preventing you from creating some outputs with a new transaction and then consuming them within the same block. Only problem you can really encounter, to my knowledge, is transaction malleability. 
See, that chain of transactions is actually a chain of transaction IDs, and those aren't actually "permanent" until they're in a block. It is possible for you to spend, spend again, then change the id of the first transaction, thus invalidating the second. This is why most clients won't accept such a thing. 
But if you don't cheat it is valid and it will confirm.

Mining is simultaneously the most and least exciting thing about Bitcoin, it's important to teach but teach with the following in mind:
Bitcoin mining is the single biggest technological breakthrough in the entire system - the concept of the blockchain solves the byzantine generals problem, a complex and important computer science problem long thought to be unsolvable. It is incredibly interesting in this respect.
The actual process of mining, however, is amazingly boring and has very little educational or intellectual value unless you're just really fascinated with SHA256 or are trying to teach from a low-level hardware angle.
TL;DR:The concept of mining is amazing and important to teach - actually mining, however, will teach little to nothing.

It's not uncommon in areas with a high population density for an apartment building to share a common coin-operated washroom.

Many such buildings also have building-wide cooling and heat provided by one large AC system rather than many individual units.
My guess is that more people are moving into such environments and as such the per capita adoption of washing machines and AC units has gone down. It's a side effect of the higher efficiency of city life and city life has grown more common.

At the end of the day, yes there is a lot you can do to increase the security of funds stored on an exchange, but if the exchange is compromised you're still hosed. Most times people lose coins it's because they've violated the single most-given piece of advice in all of Bitcoin: Don't trust other people to store your coins for you.

Ok, then let me modify my prior answer.
1) Because their local government (probably) makes them, or at least incentivizes them to the point that it's not really a choice because there are no considerable alternatives.
2) Because the average person is not adequately educated in the necessary background topics to make an intelligent decision about large-scale economic issues like the nature of their currency.
The question is only idiotic because most people aren't capable of giving a real answer. This is similar to the numerous poor tech choices people make because they have no idea what they're doing. 
The US Dollar is the Sony VAIO of currencies: It's fundamentally no different from the next currency over, but Sony is a big company and if their product costs more it must be because it's better, right?

3. Each candlestick, while labeled "201X-07-20" should be read as "201X-07-20 through 201X+1-07-20" as they represent an entire year's time. 
Candlesticks are a way of showing the open, high, low and close values for a span of time. You can create a candlestick chart that shows exactly what happened on that one specific day, down to second-long intervals if desired, but the point of longer-span candles is to show longer-term patterns.

My first crash was the June 2011 flash crash - the first real crash if I'm not mistaken (and also Gox's fault, probably not coincidentally). I had just started mining my first coins with a 14-GPU operation packed into a 700 square foot one-bedroom apartment, grossly inadequate AC and all. It was hot, noisy, probably a fire hazard and my wife hated every minute of it. When the bottom fell out of the market we spent days in a fairly deep depression and eventually shut off our rigs. Aside from what I needed to pay the miners' electric bills, though, I never cashed in.
Instead I tipped people, bought things, paid web hosting bills, ordered pizza, gave people their first taste of coin and generally did whatever the circumstances allowed me to with my stash. I took on the (totally stolen from The Matrix) attitude that when I was ready to cash out, I wouldn't have to because Bitcoin would be ubiquitous. I spent a lot of my coins this way, enough to have made me a lot of money. I view it as necessary community-building that we all had to participate in and I don't regret it for a moment.
At the time there was neither a meaningful amount of history to suggest recovery nor an army of Bitcoiners posting "HODL" memes. Back then we had to hold because we truly believed in the fundamentals and the fundamentals hadn't changed. The more of these you weather and the more great things you see Bitcoin do, the more you begin to approach a state of financial Zen - eventually.
I'll admit, that first crash truly frightened and depressed me. I legitimately cried because I thought I'd just witnessed the death of the greatest technology I'd ever seen. Several "crashes" later and OP's GIF about does my reaction justice.

Ah the old uppercase I lowercase l trick. I do love my sans-serif fonts but man they can screw you sometimes...
While I'd never advise that you click a link in a phishing email, it's worth noting that if you had clicked the link most modern browsers would display the domain portion of the URL in lowercase. The parts after the URL browsers need to preserve case since most web servers *are* case sensitive.
Thus, a link to "paypaI.com" would still display as "paypai.com" in the url bar after you've clicked it, possibly giving you a second chance to back out of the whole thing.
Because of case-preservation of paths, however, something like  would still work - or at least it *would* work if that user had actually registered his username with an uppercase I... Or if Reddit's font had similar glyphs for l and I... Oh well, you get the idea.

I agree, it's a sad truth. Sadly it doesn't change the fact that there are people with guns who will take your money, lock you in a cage or just plain beat/kill you for not complying with their version of the rules.
For example, at BitcoinStore we state true value on exports and that results in citizens of some countries being charged absurdly high import tariffs (VAT). Our customers don't like this and neither do we. We're repeatedly asked to state false value, but we never do. We don't do this because we agree with the concept of VAT or the idea of being forced to reveal the value or contents of a shipment, but because the people with guns can and will take away our money, freedom and lives.
Does the threat of having our awesome stuff taken away reduce the amount of awesome stuff we could have? Yep. Is it horrible terrible bullshit? Yep. Will they still put us in a cage no matter how much we are against them having the power to do so? Yep.
As a group of freedom-loving people it is indeed our responsibility to change all of these things, remake the world in a more favorable image, but we also must recognize that we are NOT the side that has all the guns, tanks and political power. We're the side throwing rocks at the people with M16s and we need to behave accordingly. It doesn't mean we shouldn't fight, it means we need to be smart about it.
This is guerilla warfare, we fight only the battles we know we can win and we take all the weapons we can carry off our fallen enemies. A series of small wins makes us stronger and we can go after bigger wins with time. Charging headlong into the enemy is suicide.

It's not uncommon to send text messages using email gateways, actually. You can sign up for a (fairly cheap) service that will tell you what carrier a given phone number belongs to and send an email to the appropriate gateway address.
For example, if my cellphone number is (123) 456-7890 and your query tells you that's a Verizon number, you can text message it by emailing 1234567890

Not necessarily. The above text is just a string resource that's embedded in the binary. If you open up any old executable in a resource hacker you'll (usually) find the text of every error message that app is capable of generating, so the presence of this text in the executable merely means that this is an error it is capable of throwing, not that the circumstances for it to be thrown have been achieved.

I've edited my reply for politeness, sorry about the knee-jerk. Here's what I'm really saying...
I've spent most of my life alternating between work in the payments industry and gaming (casino, gambling). Both of these fields make extremely heavy use of the "fractional cent" idea, but it remains only an idea. You can add up three 1/3 cent profits to realize a one cent profit, but you can't ever realize  0.283 cents in profit. Fractional cents therefore exist only as a conceptual construct within closed systems - every time you interact with another person monetarily your options are restricted to those made available by the monetary system, and fractional cents are not one of those options.
Also, that a currency could be rebased does not make it analog. We often use digital systems to model analog phenomena, time for example. Simply because a clock exists that shows the time down to the femtosecond doesn't make a clock that only shows hours and minutes cease to be digital. Digital things have a fixed number of options available within their frame of reference, if the frame of reference changes that does not make an object become or cease to be digital unless the number of options becomes or ceases to be infinite.
I have a few half-pennies in my coin collection. That they exist didn't make the system non-digital, it just made it digital with a base unit of a half-cent. Our current system is digital with a base unit of one cent and if the folks who want to get rid of the penny get their way it will become digital with a base unit of 5 cents.

Some VPS providers will allow you to grow resources independently of one another, like having an absurd 8TB hard disk with only 1 core and 512MB of RAM. Others (and this is by far more common) offer a handful of configurations wherein the options scale together, so upgrading from 40GB to 50GB of disk space probably also means buying another couple of processor cores and a gig or two of RAM.
TL;DR: Just don't use cookie-cutter VPS services for Bitcoin nodes, you'll eventually run into disk space problems.

Some of it is, some of it isn't and some of it can't be.
PCI compliance requires encryption under most circumstances and most software complies, though often poorly.
Even when stored data is encrypted the fact remains that any system which decrypts that data will have a decrypted copy in memory. If that system is compromised such that memory may be arbitrarily read it really doesn't matter if storage is encrypted. 
There's also a fair amount of data on the cards themselves which is not encrypted. Since most card readers are HID devices they can be snooped on with regular everyday keyloggers. There's no fixing that one without reexamining the fundamentals of how the system works as a whole.

The votes truly don't matter if you're viewing in isolation - if everyone has the same number of downvotes from the bot then things still rise and fall relative to one another as they should.
The part you're missing is that doesn't exist in isolation. If you subscribe to multiple subreddits or your goal is to get posts to the front page, the downvote bots hurt all content here relative to other content. This subreddit's content gets pushed down by those votes relative to posts in subreddits without bots.
It's also particularly damaging in that Reddit's post ordering algorithm weights votes by recency, meaning that several downvotes from bots within seconds of posting can often bury a post so deep those are the only votes it will ever get because no one will ever see it.
This is a real problem. Shame on you for equating it to karma whoring.

In this case the "influences outside of voting" are probably "the law." The Internet may seem like a land of free speech to users, but to those running the sites you love it's more like a legal minefield. 
Reddit can't legally comply with your "anti-censorship" demands because they are legally required to censor some things. In the sense that yelling "fire" in a movie theater is not protected free speech, neither is publishing the stolen records of thousands of innocents.
If this were *just* Gox data we could call it "whistle blowing" and it would exist in legal gray area with *some* protections. With customer data, it cannot be hosted here.
Whether you like the laws or not is immaterial to the people in fancy costumes who carry guns and enforce those laws. If you fear their retribution, you comply. Would it make you feel better to imagine Reddit being held at gunpoint and being forced to take posts down? Because that is essentially the truth.

Technically, storing your wallet on a USB drive doesn't make it "cold storage." Maybe warm storage? In this context, "hot" means "used on an internet-connected computer" and "cold" means "this private key has never seen the internet." The distinction is important because if you keep your wallet on a USB drive, then plug it into a virus-infested internet-connected PC to make a transaction your funds are still going to disappear. The idea of cold storage is to sign transactions offline so that access to the physical device holding your private keys becomes a necessary part of the process. This reduces the big complex digital security problem to a physical security problem you can solve with old-school tech like a safe or a bank deposit box.
I did a [video series]( on cold storage a while back that started with an overview of the basic ideas and concepts, it might be worth a watch. As part of the series I also built an electrum-based cold storage system with a relatively cheap Acer netbook, which you may consider as an option if you have the time, money and skills to build it - as well as an adequate number of coins to be worth protecting.
Fair warning: Building an actual computer-based cold storage system is complicated, time-consuming and requires hardware that costs money. Until dedicated hardware wallets become widely available you may have an easier time sticking to paper wallets.
Do note, however, that paper wallets have their own complexities in that every time you use one you're supposed to sweep the remaining funds into an entirely new paper wallet, which gets annoying pretty quickly IMO.
If you BIP38 encrypt the private key, it increases the security of a paper wallet somewhat and as long as you use it carefully on trusted devices you may feel comfortable re-using that wallet. You could even get something like a [cold card]( to make such paper wallets easier to carry. I recommend this amount for small to medium amounts of coin, so your life savings should still be in true cold storage.

Exactly my point, it's not a quote standing on its own legs, it's someone painting an artistic vision of what that quote means.


I've actually spent most of my day trying to explain this to people, so thanks for backing me up on that at least. It's surprising how many people seem to equate a criminal complaint with evidence or a trial when it's more like a permission slip from the judge to actually have a trial.


It could also be interpreted as Shrem helping a customer work around technical limitations imposed by a third party so he could keep their business. It's only money laundering if BTCKing's gains were somehow ill-gotten, which as I may have mentioned a few posts up, it doesn't seem like they were - Shrem didn't file a SAR because there was no SA to R.
The entire case hangs on the predicate that back when this all went down it was explicitly illegal for BTCKing to buy Bitcoins from BitInstant then resell them anonymously for GreenDot cards on Silk Road. This would be illegal today because we've received specific government guidance on the issue, but it wasn't illegal back then and you don't get to apply laws ex post facto.
Of course none of this changes my original point: That none of this is even evidence. That we'll have to wait for a trial to see, if there even is one.

Allow me to explain via anecdote why you are wrong.
A few weeks ago I went to a local pizza place that accepts Bitcoin. They have really good PoS integration with QR codes containing both address and amount on their receipts. I had my phone ready when they brought the receipt, scanned it and hit send. 3 seconds, tops.
Today I paid a friend some money I owed her via Bitcoin - she's still fairly new so didn't really know what she was doing and I'd forgotten to top off my phone wallet. I had to decode a BIP38 key on the spot while talking her through the receiving end of the transaction. Took about 3 minutes.
Similarly, most of us can swipe a debit card and punch a PIN in ~10 seconds or so, but occasionally you encounter one of those merchants whose system asks you 37 questions, bugs you for donations and really REALLY wants to make sure you're CERTAIN the amount is correct - and then you hear the damn thing start DIALING A PHONE NUMBER. We've also all been stuck behind people who, inexplicably, still think personal checks are an appropriate way to pay for groceries - or those that just stare at the credit/debit terminal like it's alien technology. God help you if there's a line for self-checkout.
To say Bitcoin is faster in terms of transaction speed is indeed nonsense, but to say it's worse is also nonsense. Transaction speed can be affected by the system, but it mostly depends on the quality of the merchant's implementation and on the capabilities and preparedness of the customer.

The idea behind accredited investors was that the average person alive in 1933 (when the law passed) probably lacked the capability to make sure they didn't get swindled out of their life savings. The rich, by virtue of having already made their fortunes, were assumed to have a better capability to protect their own interests. Those without such capability were forced to invest through third parties whose job was (supposedly) look after your interests for you.
Apparently they haven't gotten the news that since they passed that law the internet became a thing. That means most of us are now aware that there isn't a Nigerian prince just itching to give us free money. It also means most of us are capable of simply googling a potential investment and learning things about it.
Accredited investing was created back when investing had a meaningful (natural) barrier to entry: Markets are complex things and back then our technology for aggregating and disseminating market information (including the nature of known scams) was quite poor. Today, the amount of market information you can accidentally absorb while watching the news dwarfs the entirety of data available from all sources in 1933.
Today, as an individual, you are required to have a million in the bank or make more than $200,000 annually to be considered for accreditation. To me, that sounds less like consumer protection and more like an artificial barrier to entry.

Not long ago I'd have said to get each kid their own ASICMiner USB stick since they were on amazon/ebay for $10 to $15. Currently, though, there's nothing on Amazon but the newer $40 to $60 model. Still cheap, but probably not cheap enough to get one for each kid. Still, the cost to teach mining is relatively low - especially when you realize that the true value for the kids is in understanding the way mining creates the blockchain rather than the act of mining itself. That lesson costs you a lot less to teach and gives the kids a lot more for it.

Just FYI, and this varies a bit depending on the bank, merchant services company, merchant, etc:
Chances are good your refund won't come out of the bank's pocket. It will almost certainly come from Walgreens' pocket, since they'll be the victim of the tx reversal. 
The real travesty of the credit card system is that it turns every theft into two thefts. Walgreens will have now lost both the products purchased and the money used to purchase them, thus inflating the economic impact of the theft.

Much like Bitcoin lacks a central operator who could do nefarious things with the technology/infrastructure, p2p pools lack a central operator who could do nefarious things with the pool. It basically nullifies the 51% attack because no one has adequate control over the pool to launch such an attack with its combined hashing power.

It also depends a lot on scale, intent and the publisher's financial situation. When my site was quite small, for instance, tips actually out-performed ads. My handful of dedicated readers wasn't enough to get meaningful ad revenue but the tips added up to server costs plus some wiggle room.
Today I've got a much bigger audience, enough that advertising revenue could be substantial enough to make it my primary income source. Tips have not scaled along with my audience, at least not enough to be a livable income.

Probably going to get downvoted to hell for even daring to explain this but...
There is a camp that feels that "bits" and such are entirely arbitrary units and prefer descriptive language. This camp tends to prefer SI prefixes such as milli and micro since they actually include, right there in the word, information about what fraction of a whole coin you're dealing with.
The anti-SI argument is that non-mathy/sciency people don't get them very well. A lot of folks get the "big" prefixes (kilo/mega/giga/tera) these days because even the worst-educated consumer knows they want "the iPhone with the more gee-bees," but the average person has never had to pick out a capacitor or describe the width of a human hair. Milli and micro are useless to them.
And god help you if you express micro as μ. Most folks won't even know how to pronounce it.
It's also worth noting that since 1 bit = 1 μBTC we're talking about the exact same unit under two different names. Neither camp actually has a superior unit of account, it's merely a question of how much information content you prefer in the name.
Or we could all be wrong. The Satoshi *is* the fundamental unit of Bitcoin after all, and "megasatoshis" does have a nice ring...

Except that Faiella's business wasn't selling drugs, it was exchanging Green Dot cards for Bitcoin anonymously. At the time most of this business took place no FINCEN guidance had been given and as such nothing about that exchange was illegal. Silk Road may have been a shady place, but this one particular person was not using it to do anything illegal to the best of Shrem's or BitInstant's knowledge - there was nothing illegal happening to report, regardless of the Treasury Dept registration and its various reporting requirements.
Now if Faiella kept on going after the FINCEN guidance was issued, that's a problem. If BitInstant/Shrem knew he wasn't following the necessary AML/KYC rules then that's a problem for them as well. Sadly the complaint does not go into much detail here.
It's also important to remember that this is a criminal complaint, not a retrospective of a fair trial. The job of a criminal complaint is to paint the defendant(s) in the worst possible light and present the most damning possible version of events. The emails you are citing are not presented in context or in their entirety and many are not even presented in the actual words used but are "helpfully" interpreted by law enforcement agents.
This doesn't make the statement invalid or dismiss the evidence, but you should always keep in mind when reading criminal complaints that they are, by definition, skewed dramatically against the defendant(s). Treat them with the same gravity you'd afford a political attack ad.

Your choice of symbols sounds an awful lot like calling someone fat when you're actually trying to imply he's stupid or inept. I'm pissed at the guy too, but I'd be just as pissed if he were a 90 pound vegetarian munching on carrots while Rome burned. His choice of beverage or relative girth is immaterial and merely mentioning them detracts from the issue at hand: That Gox/Karpeles are blaming Bitcoin itself for their inability to correctly use Bitcoin.
The other exchanges certainly had the same vulnerability, but none of them lost money because they all followed common sense procedures around the issue. The issue here isn't that transaction malleability existed, it's that it only affected you if you explicitly trusted tx hashes like a moron. That is Gox's fault and they're not taking responsibility, choosing instead to blame Bitcoin itself for ever having a weakness that allowed others to exploit their ineptitude. One of the biggest names in Bitcoin, a community that's always touting personal responsibility as a virtue, is not taking personal responsibility for their own failure and is choosing to injure the community instead.

I think the most important part is actually the economics. Economics isn't even a required subject in most schools any more (it sure wasn't in mine) and that leads to most of the worst misunderstandings I've heard. A basic economics education is much more important than simply teaching kids the specifics of Bitcoin as it will allow them to answer many of their own questions.
My problem has never been teaching people the tech, honestly most people probably don't need to know the tech (beyond what they need to know to stay safe) but literally every person I've ever turned on to Bitcoin had to ask my "why is this worth anything?" Teaching kids the concepts underlying money is way more important than teaching them the difference between ECDSA and RSA.
It's far more important to know why Bitcoin matters than to know how it works - though I support learning of any kind and especially Bitcoin learning.

You blame yourself for not having enabled 2FA, but the fact remains that you weren't the only theft. The platform was compromised - perhaps in a way you could have personally circumvented, but it WAS compromised.
Also, 2FA can protect you from password theft, but it can't protect you from the service losing control of their wallet. 2FA is meaningless if the attackers control the service's private keys, since they have no need to pass through that security layer in order to take coins.
Best security practices DO say you should enable 2FA everywhere it's an option, but they also say you shouldn't keep large amounts of coin in someone else's wallet.

It's probably also worth noting that this is the only reason GPU mining works as well. Each GPU core has access to a very small amount of dedicated RAM, nowhere near enough for BIP0038's 16MiB footprint but easily enough for Litecoin's 128KiB. If the mining process required more RAM than each core had dedicated to it they would have to use a much slower pipeline to shared RAM, dramatically reducing performance to the point that GPU would be no better than CPU, possibly worse.
Litecoin was originally made to be both GPU and ASIC resistant, after all - which could have been really intersting... too bad they botched the implementation.

And at a roughly $7.8 Billion market cap Bitcoin would only be a mid-cap company (if it were a company). Do not fool yourself into thinking that $47M is a lot of money on the sort of scales we're talking about - Bitcoin is only mid-cap after all this time, Doge is nano. The FBI seized nearly 3 times your entire valuation from one web site (Silk Road) alone. If MtGox's reports are correct, they lost almost 10 times the value of every DGC in existence. Even at this kind of scale, Bitcoin is still considered a fairly small fish in a very big pond.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying $47,000,000 is nothing - I was damn excited when Bitcoin broke $1M, ecstatic when it broke $1B and neither of those is meaningful on the global scale. What I'm saying is that $47M doesn't make you good or bad - you're just another currency in a room full of currencies and while market cap may be one criteria we could use to pick winners and losers, it is very far from the only criteria - or even the most important one.
What I'm saying is: If I'm hiring a banker from a room full of bankers I may or may not go with the one that's got the nicest suit (highest market cap) but I will definitely exclude the one who showed up wearing a foam-rubber nose and clown shoes. There is an amount of seriousness that is appropriate in this space.

Then stop looking at the PoS companies.

Make something like a bitcoind proxy that accepts that format, handles the bitcoiny stuff and sends back an XML response.
You might have to shove things in weird fields where they don't belong, but it'd be way easier to make Bitcoin emulate the back-end software these PoS softwares already support than getting the PoS vendors to add a route.

There's also the part where at those kinds of scales power becomes an issue relatively quickly. If BFL had been mining with the 45,000 units they shipped on the 13th, for example, it would take between 1 and 13 MEGAWATTS to power them all (depending on what % where Jalapenos and what % were Singles).
That kind of power isn't just available from the wall, it requires infrastructure. A standard home or business fuse can give you about 20A, or 2kW here in the states, at the lower end of the previously-specified range you'd need a minimum of 500 times that amount of power. The upper range would require almost 6,000 standard house circuits.
Even if you went beyond a single circuit and looked at what entire homes/offices are breakered at, you're still only talking 1 or 2 50A (5.5kW) fuses. If BFL wanted to run all their miners in my medium-to-large house, they'd need at least 180 of them.
This isn't to say that they couldn't do it, but there would be noticable infrastructure for that kind of power consumption. People have toured BFL's facilities and so far no one has mentioned them having 2 of [these]( laying around - not to mention the kind of fuel stockpiles you'd need to run those 24/7.
Other manufacturers would face similar problems, but I don't have sales and power data for their products right in front of me to make real estimates.

Well, eventually *someone* needs an internet connection, given that the internet is the communications methodology most nodes currently use - but there's nothing stating that's an explicit requirement. Bitcoin could operate just as well over HSMM-Mesh, cellular or satellite networks, etc. You can also route transactions over whatever kind of link you have available to an internet-connected endpoint.
I once read a locally-crafted-and-signed Electrum transaction to someone over the phone and had him broadcast it for me, just to prove it could be done. It took a few tries but it's feasible to think a protocol for it could be developed with some work that wouldn't involve reading quite so many long case-sensitive pieces of text out loud.
TL;DR: The internet is used to communicate Bitcoin transactions because it's common and convenient - not because it's an actual requirement.

Any 2 sets is adequate to recover from, and any 1 set has incomplete data. Safe from destruction, safe from theft.

In fairness, our monetary units of account are almost universally antiquated. Outside of the U.S. much of the world is accustomed to metric and would ask you precisely the opposite about units like distance or volume.
Is the distance from your house to the store 5,000 meters? Of course not, it's 5km. Is your hard disk capacity 500 billion bytes? I'll bet you prefer to say 500gb.
In all seriousness, though, it's an entirely arbitrary decision since the units are interchangeable. We're not talking about two breeds of dog here, we're talking about what to name the one dog we've got.

The best approach to moderation is usually a middle ground approach. You don't want a taxi service where the users bark orders and the mods obey, nor do you want a city bus that goes where it goes and to hell with requests. 
You want a horseback ride. You want to occasionally nudge the community/horse in the right direction, but for the most part let it choose it's own path. 
Mods should not be deities, malevolent or kind. Mods should be gardeners, pruning what doesn't fit, but always giving nature center stage.

I think you're conflating the idea of the spec with the idea of the implementations. The spec is the thing you want to be perfect and unchanging, because it's the rules all the implementations have to follow.
The implementations themselves, which is what is being depicted, have widely varying featuresets built around the same core protocol. You can change a thousand things in a wallet without ever touching the core functionality bits, they usually sit off to the side in their own module and tend not to get touched.
The visualization software simply has no tools with which to make the distinction between someone changing core functionality and someone fixing a typo in the help file.

Coinbase has a long history of launching features too soon. The effects of this are twofold:
1. Some people are excluded or otherwise disenfranchised because they are unable to use the feature due to its incompleteness.
2. Some people who start using the feature are excluded or disenfranchised by later changes made in the name of accessibility.
Launching with an incomplete set of licenses isn't that big of a deal. Launching with licenses to operate in only 4 of the 10 most populous states is a big deal. The missing 6 account for over 28% of the entire nation.
27% of the entire nation is contained in the top 3 - of which they're missing two. Just two states could give them back 15% of the entire country.
I'm not super bitter about my own state's exclusion, nor am I asking for all 50 states plus Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, etc - but at least secure the big ones.

Actually it would be identical, just in reverse. Instead of the card sending payment info over NFC and the merchant pulling the money, the merchant would send a payment request over NFC and the customer pushes the money. Tap, optionally press button to confirm, maybe enter a pin or password depending on your wallet settings. Done. 
If you're OK with reducing security to that level you could even have a wallet auto send on any requests under a certain amount, making it identical to tap to pay cards. I wouldn't, but it's possible.

SPV or Simple Payment Verification refers to a kind of Bitcoin wallet that doesn't download quite so much data. 
They pull this off by applying something called a "bloom filter" which is a way of filtering out only blocks containing our own transactions or transactions we're interested in. 
The benefit is that you only have to download block headers to figure out which blocks you need and you only download and store a tiny fraction of the overall data. 
The downside is that you don't have a full set of data so you can't verify transactions back to the source, only a fixed number of blocks back. You also don't have a full set of blocks to pass to peers, earning SPV wallets the unfortunate nickname "selfish wallets." 
Assuming high enough difficulty, the partial data is enough, and you are still functioning peer to peer, so it's not a huge departure, just a way of saving space and bandwidth without relying in 3rd parties.

The question of nVidia-based mining has been discussed at great length here and elsewhere. Realistically the issue boils down to this: ATI/AMD has traditionally crammed tons of dumbed-down ALUs into their cards while nVidia has concentrated on making each ALU do more.

Sitting in wallets being a) hoarded or b) spent on stuff. There are multiple fallacies at work here. 1) MtGox isn't the only exchange (though they are the biggest) 2) drugs aren't the only thing you can buy with Bitcoin and 3) aside from reserves and current account balances, coins aren't *at* Gox, they are traded there and then moved or used elsewhere - some might use Gox as an eWallet, but it's not recommended practice. 
OP's question is akin to "only x USD are traded on the currency markets each day and only y USD are used to buy thing z so where is the rest of the USD?" Even a currency as small-time as Bitcoin represents a large and complex system that can't and shouldn't be summed up so trivially.

For now, all that's being implemented is that in addition to the regular blockchain, Bitcoin will keep a smaller "pruned" database containing only the unspent outputs of transactions, which should dramatically increase the speed with which it can operate. They're also changing the format they're storing the database in to be somewhat more efficient. None of this is controversial, really.
In the future, the "ultraprune" concept may extend to the actual pruning of extraneous data out of the block chain and this is where Atlas gets his panties in a bunch. While it's true that actually modifying the block chain would be big and scary and require a hell of a user consensus before moving forward, that's not what's actually happening here.
A lot of folks are also concerned that some clients keeping full copies of the block chain while others keep only pruned or partial copies will create a sort of centralization where a huge number of people use the network without participating while a smaller central cluster of core users actually store the block chain. While I have no words to appease this concern, I can note that it's already happened so we should probably stop worrying about preventing it. A tremendous number of users store their coins in eWallets, directly on the exchanges or on mobile "selfish" clients that don't store the block chain locally. A lot of desktop users are moving to clients like Electrum that keep the block chain on some kind of "master node" so that every user doesn't have to download and store gigs of data just to use Bitcoin. These are all solutions to a very real problem that ultraprune is one of the first steps toward solving.
Sadly Atlas doesn't understand ultraprune at all so it scares him and he feels like spreading FUD all over Reddit - and under multiple accounts too, do I get the sense that he's being banned for inappropriate behavior?

While I do agree with the general spirit of "caveat emptor" I have to say I find your comment to be insulting, mean-spirited and a gross oversimplification of a scenario that deserves adequate coverage and representation. Regardless what you feel about those holding pirate's debt, people need to learn from the mistakes of history and your general "who cares" attitude does no one any favors.

@_date: 2012-09-18 20:38:33
Since you're basically [reposting comments from HN]( I'll go ahead and copy/paste my first explanation of why you're wrong:
If the devices speak Bitcoin I can say "only open the door if someone has a key that I (and only I) have sent this kind of transaction to" - when I sign the transaction I prove that I am the holder of the "root key" that lock is programmed to trust and I'm certifying permissions to the holder of a second key. They can then use sign some random arbitrary data the entry system sends to them (handshake) to prove that they control a key I've signed off on. Bitcoin is distributed by nature but it's based around split-key cryptography and using ECDSA to prove the ownership of keys. You're not using secret data encoded in the key to open the door, you're using the key itself and a signed transaction to establish trust.
By way of a functional example:
I have a lock, it knows it has a unique ID of 123.
I have a keypair A, the lock is programmed to trust messages signed by keypair A. Keypair A, which I alone control, is considered the root signing authority.
My friend has a keypair B. I encode a message in the block chain signed by A that says something equivalent to "lock 123, you may open for whoever controls public key B"
When either I or my friend come to the door and scan at the lock, we send it our public key. If the public key matches one that the lock has been told to trust, it sends back some random data. We sign that random data with private key A or B, thus proving that we actually own that keypair, and the lock opens.
If someone else sends a message to lock 123 that isn't signed in an appropriate way by some key the lock has been told to trust it ignores the encoded message. If someone sends it a public key that it doesn't trust, it ignores that too.
I need to give access to my wife, who holds keypair C. I send another message to the lock saying "allow access for keypair C but also make keypair C an administrator so she can grant access to others too"
All of this happens transparently in milliseconds with a simple application that could run on your smartphone.

Fine, I'll spell out the underlying meaning that everyone else but you seemed to get: If I were a dishonest douche with the right resources, the stuff BFL showed me could be used to give me a one-up on them and potentially introduce high-level competition much faster than would otherwise be possible, to the detriment of their business.

@_date: 2012-11-25 20:40:35
I've spoken directly with a few folks inside BFL about this exact issue and while you're sort of kind of right, you're also kind of wrong. "Underclocked" is probably the wrong word to use. BFL's ASICs (and all ASICs really) have some theoretical maximum hashrate that you could achieve with an infinitely large power supply and infinitely efficient cooling. Since neither of these factors can feasibly be infinite in the real world, a balance must be struck.
BFL has already increased speed once to match a competitor's claims, and part of the cost of that increase was that the Jalapeno, for example, can no longer be powered from a single USB port - they had to increase the power draw of all devices to increase the hashrate and this  increase in power requires a commensurate increase in cooling capacity which, thankfully, their existing heatsink designs could already accommodate. Further increases are likely possible, but would require another similar increase in power. I have no idea what kind of BTU/H those ASICs are putting off or how much the heatsink can dissipate, but  at some point they will run into a wall.
In short, it's not so much that they were "downclocked" - it's that (like most chips) they can be pushed beyond stock settings if you're able/willing to provide more power and cooling.

It's not really a matter of them being "too arcane" or requiring special software... Think of it like this:
An nVidia card is like a panel of 5 astrophysicists - there are only a handful of them but each person on the panel is BRILLIANT.
An ATI/AMD card is like a classroom with 100 high school students - none of them is particularly brilliant, but there's 100 of them.
If you're trying to prove Fermat's last theorem, the panel of 5 astrophysicists is your best bet. If you need 5,000 addition problems done, the 100 high school students will be faster.
Bitcoin is one of the latter problems: SHA256(SHA256(x)) does not require a particularly brilliant processor core to accomplish, so the difference between one of ATI/AMD's cores and nVidia's much smarter cores is meaningless, the efficiency comes down to the sheer number of cores, which is a contest that ATI/AMD easily wins.

Well firstly, because with a MtGox account you don't actually control the private keys to your Bitcoin addresses, MtGox does. That means if MtGox loses their databases, happens to be run by scammers or otherwise decides to hose you, they have all the power to do so. Using either a desktop client or an eWallet with client-side keys like blockchain.info keeps you in control of your private keys - even if they turn out to be scammers or their site folds up, you still have your funds and, more importantly, they never have your keys and therefore can't steal or lose your funds.

This isn't really the trivial question it seems like it is, unfortunately. There are other factors involved such as cost of electricity, exchange rate and difficulty.

was referring to some an ability some aircraft have to climb nearly vertically, until its angle of attack becomes too great, at which point drag becomes a more significant force than lift and... you have problems. This is called the critical angle of attack (AoA) or stall point. Small, agile planes typically have high critical AoA (The F-18's AoA is over 70 degrees) and big hulking jetliners typically have much lower stall points.
was (correctly) pointing out that this craft was probably not able to climb so steeply because of such aerodynamic effects, but rather because it had enough thrust, relative to its weight, to simply point its engines at the ground and fly straight upwards - no aerodynamic assistance from the wings needed.
This requires a thrust-to-weight ratio that is greater than 1 - significantly greater in order for a craft of that size to climb vertically. Most fighter jets capable of true vertical takeoff and landing have a TWR of about 1.2 during such maneuvers. This plane probably isn't that powerful, but the steeper your climb angle, the less help you get from aerodynamic lift and the more you rely on those engines. To manage such a steep (but still not vertical) takeoff, this craft must have an amazing TWR for its class.
Typical TWR for a fully loaded jet of this type is typically around 0.25 and most such craft have a critical angle of attack around 15 to 20 degrees, suggesting that this jet must have significantly stronger engines or significantly less weight than normal in order to climb so steeply, since there are no noticeable aerodynamic changes that would account for an additional 20+ degrees AoA.

Aside from the cost of fixing their security and maybe some fines and legal fees, Target won't really be the one hit with this at all. Almost the entire burden of this theft will end up on merchants like yourself who accepted a card that was stolen from someone else.
This is a large part of why I'm ok with transactions being irreversible: If my private key is compromised, that's almost always my fault. Occasionally things like the Android RNG bug will happen, but the vast majority of the time if someone breaks my security it's my fault and I'm the one who loses money.

Let's say someone steals my credit card and buys a $500 TV with it. I make a phone call and get the charges reversed.
* I'm out a tiny amount of value because my time is worth something, right? It's also not this easy, if my card was really stolen I'll need to have it replaced and every place I've got that card on file will need updating.
* The merchant loses the $500 from your card as the transaction is reversed, the $300 they paid for the TV from their wholesaler and about a $25 average chargeback fee from the credit card company.
So the thief deals $825 worth of harm to the merchant (and, by extension, the economy) and $0 (but some annoyance and time) worth of harm to you. The merchant loses the value of the fraudulent transaction plus another $325 in merchandise and fees.
Let's look at the Bitcoin equivalent:
* I'm out $500 because my coins were stolen
* The merchant makes the $300 the TV cost plus $200 profit.
In this case you lose exactly $500 and the merchant gains $200, thus offsetting the total amount of damage done to the economy down to $300 from $825.
The current system isn't better, it's just better for YOU - and it manages that by being worse for both merchants and the economy.

Actually, in the event of a chargeback, most costs are borne by the merchant, often with added fees - not to mention that they're also out money for the stolen merchandise. Credit card fraud is far from victimless, but most people will never become credit card acceptors so it's easier for the credit card companies to externalize their costs to (victimize) the smaller group (merchants) than the larger one (consumers). Merchants essentially have no choice but to accept credit cards, at least in the U.S., or they'll lose 80% or more of their business and they have an extremely limited range of choices for payment processors, each one more greedy and draconian than the last. It's a pretty terrible system, hence why so many merchants are so glad we're trying to topple it.
As for Bitcoin being more dangerous than credit cards, there is a distinction here. The fundamentals of Bitcoin are inherently secure, it is simply that people lacking the proper skillset have difficulty implementing key security. I'm not dismissing this, it's a serious problem that we need to create better solutions for before we can call ourselves ready for public consumption, but let's be bluntly honest: Every theft to date has been an implementation problem, not a (Bitcoin) protocol problem.
Oh, and there's no shame in not having that skillset, it's like taking a random person and asking them to either drive a car or fly an airplane - a lot more people in the world simply know how to drive than fly. Secure key management practices aren't the sort of thing one is likely to just "pick up" in the course of an average lifetime. We're dealing with a steep learning curve and no one's yet written a good study guide.

Editing *is* a bit of a chore but I honestly find it kind of relaxing and creative so I don't mind adding a bit more of it, especially if the final product is better.

People give blockchain.info a lot of crap but they forget that until extremely recently it was a one-man operation.
**Edit:** *Since I forgot to quote the previous comments and they've been deleted, some background... The fellow we were arguing with was suggesting that because they hadn't updated their github repository to reflect recent production code changes, blockchain.info was not still open source. This was true for a very short time, but only because Ben (their main developer) simply forgot to check in his changes to the repo. It was all over until someone told him about the mistake and he immediately fixed it, quite a while before this comment was posted.*

We operate at 0% markup relative to our wholesaler, we can't do much better than that. If Amazon has a better price, they must have a better supplier for that one part. We still have better prices than Amazon/NewEgg/etc on many products and we're working on getting more/better suppliers which can increase the range of products for which our price is better.
As far as returns go, we have a standard and fairly lenient return policy. We don't have the option of chargebacks, no, because we only accept Bitcoin and Bitcoin does not support them. The vast majority of all disputes settle civilly and there are age-old systems in place for the rare occasions that diplomacy fails.

I'm not disagreeing with you on that point. Securing a private key is a very uncommon skill, it's not the sort of thing you arbitrarily pick up over the course of a normal lifetime. This is why we have so much work ahead of us. We need to find ways to make key management easier and simpler. BIP38 and hardware wallets are a big step in the right direction, but it's a long road that we're just barely starting down now.

A brain wallet based on intelligible English text is almost always a bad idea. That said, memorizing a mnemonic for an existing key or seed does add an extra layer to a good backup plan.

Dwolla basically only exists at its current size because of MtGox and now they're beginning to bite the hand that feeds them. Dwolla has become increasingly Bitcoin-hostile in recent days and, as a Bitcoin funding source, is largely in decline.
I would pull your money out of Dwolla, close your account and if they ask why tell them you're one Bitcoiner of many who will no longer use their service.
There are plenty of perfectly convenient ways to buy with cash deposit or ACH transfer these days, you shouldn't have to deal with Dwolla any more.

I've always said paper wallets are a bad idea - not that the idea of having an offline keypair is bad, but that the idea of printing it on paper is bad. You don't even need a genius-level IQ to figure it out, you just need to know a scrapbooker. Most papers and inks contain acids, volatile organic compounds and all kinds of stuff that, even if it doesn't succumb to flood or fire, just doesn't age well. Sure, you could print with acid-free inks on archival quality paper but... does anyone really think that far ahead? Would it even be worth it to create something that can still be destroyed by flood or fire?
Here's how you do an offline physical wallet properly.
Step 1: Order a set of metal punches, they're not particularly expensive. There are some accessories that will make your life easier - bench block, a good hammer, etc - but assuming you already own a hammer and a sturdy horizontal surface they're not strictly necessary. [Here's]( a decent set for $15.
Step 2: Order something made of durable metal to stamp on. If you're already a precious metals collector you might have a chunk of age-proof noble metal sitting around that will last for centuries, but something as simple and cheap as steel dog tags will last for several decades and only cost you a few bucks.
Step 3: Convert your private key to a non-case-sensitive format. 5JbR5avuxGE6BJzoP6P8Be7VtEP9pJUHqy6rKAJzo89yLHYGyxT might be the most compact way you can store your private key, but hexidecimal is easier to copy off your work piece without errors: 806678b7dfdc4741856abcb17762fffff84e1d7eb5741d752952f9af104d1a583a14447478. Even better would be a mnemonic like Electrum uses for its seed or [brainwallet.org's]( "poetry" format:
"bid great shame unseen bounce dumb dude search creep look age plastic beaten attempt arrow horrible slam real kingdom everywhere careful situation red join"
It may take more space and a longer time to transcribe but you're less likely to screw it up and you can lose multiple characters from a word and still be able to read it.
Step 4: For added security, I like to break the key up into 3 pieces and make 2 copies of each piece. That way they can be distributed in pairs such that two sets are required to completely reconstruct the key (key parts 1 2 and 3 distributed in pairs 1+2, 2+3 and 1+3). I store each pair in a separate but secure location, ensuring that one set can be lost or compromised with no loss of data and no chance of key compromise.
Keypart 1 = bid great shame unseen bounce dumb dude search
Keypart 2 = creep look age plastic beaten attempt arrow horrible
Keypart 3 = slam real kingdom everywhere careful sitaution red join
Having a paper wallet as an additional backup can be convenient - as long as it survives you can very trivially recover your key from the QR code - but it should never be your only copy of the key. Much like a memorized brain wallet, paper wallets are FRAGILE. They're excellent as an additional backup method but should always be part of a more complete backup strategy.
Remember the 321 rule for the minimum acceptable backups, folks: 3 copies, 2 formats/mediums, 1 off-site.

This is more what I was referring to, not microtransactions in the satoshi range, but anything under a dollar or so - the kind of transactions traditional merchants end up paying a 25% transaction fee for because of the raping VISA/MC is giving them, roughly the transaction range of the average coins-only vending machine.
If the goal of Bitcoin is to be cash-like then I should be able to buy a 25c pack of gum without incurring a 4c (16%) transaction fee.

Well if you want to go that far he actually bought it with CNY since that's where the factory that produced it is. Sony and Amazon, by this standard, are also middlemen. Or maybe he bought it with the sweat of the laborers who dug the raw materials from the ground? Or with the lives of the ancient creatures who perished to create all the plastics and petrochemicals?
Every purchase you make is a long chain of purchases, a grand scheme of supply and demand that finally made its way to you. Choosing where to draw the already-arbitrary lines in an attempt to destroy someone's excitement and happiness says a lot more about you than it does about Bitcoin.

I think you have your cause and effect mixed up here. It's not that they cleared their backlog because profit reduced, rather profit reduced because they cleared their backlog.
Mining is a zero sum game, so every unit you ship makes the unit behind it slightly less profitable. If it takes you too long to ship this can be disastrous for your later customers, but they were always at the end of the list and were always going to see reduced profits, it's merely a matter of the time table in which those reduced profits are realized.
Those early in the curve will always make the biggest profit while those late to the party always run the risk of losing money. This is no one's fault, it is merely the risk inherent in pre-ordering mining equipment that doesn't exist yet. If you want to blame BFL for anything, blame them for continuing to use the pre-order model.

As for the "Roger Ver is a convicted felon" thing, here's the story in his own words: 
TL;DR: He (along with TONS of other merchants) sold what were technically [illegal fireworks]( on eBay after having called some ATF agents "jack-booted thugs and murderers" in a public forum, to their faces. The fireworks got pulled from the market, everyone else got fines at most, Roger (mysteriously...) was the only person sent to jail.

Yes, but the unspoken truth in that statement is that 99% of the cost of an ASIC is in the initial design - it would be foolish to not order more chips and for that matter I'm not sure there are ASIC fabricators that would make you just one chip, minimum order size is at least a wafer, which is a lot of chips.
In the strictest sense of the term, no, the existence of one ASIC does not prove the existence of more, but it does suggest that existence so strongly that it's pretty fair to make the assumption that this isn't the only chip.

[BitcoinStore]( will ship internationally, it just takes a little longer and depending on the size and weight of what you order may not be worth the shipping cost.
Basically, our wholesaler won't drop-ship internationally so we have them drop-ship to our warehouse and we then ship from the warehouse to you. It takes a few extra days and for large items like TVs international freight costs can often be more than the cost of the TV, but for many items it is worthwhile.

Except that anonymity was never on the table here. If this were about fingerprinting on Blockchain or even BitcoinStore I'd be on your side - those services shouldn't be identifying their users, but this is a service you already have to thoroughly ID yourself in order to use, and in such a case the use of fingerprinting as part of adaptive security and anti-fraud measures isn't out of order.
For the record, I am generally on the opposite side of this: I do my best to make sure that the services I have control of gather and keep as little data as necessary about the people that use them, but you're mourning the loss of something you never had here.
It's not about adoption vs anonymity, that's a false dichotomy. It's about simple common sense.

Comparing Bitcoin and credit cards is unfair as Bitcoin was not created to be credit-card-like. It was made to be cash-like and in that respect it functions quite nicely. It's a fair criticism that Bitcoin in its current state contains few (if any) consumer protections, but the same can be said of paper money. Credit cards are an abstraction layer built on top of paper money which (among other things) provides those consumer protections - there is nothing to prevent such an abstraction layer being built on top of Bitcoin. You could probably even add consumer protections as a third-party service without modifying the protocol. People are consistently trying out new mechanisms for this including M-of-N escrow transactions and many others.
TL;DR: Bitcoin is open source money, if you don't like the way it works you're welcome to "fix" it any way you like. If the community likes what you did, they'll use it.

The blockchain thefts were due to a flaw in the android os' random number generator which affected most phone wallets at the time. No passwords were brute forced, nor was the security of ecdsa, blockchain, or bitcoin itself compromised.

No, but they will provide it upon immediate request by default. The problem with browser fingerprinting isn't tied to the legitimacy of its use, the problem is the fact that every browser will offer up an absurd amount of information and there's typically no way to tell it not to.
Also, a lot of the data used in fingerprinting is in fact sent with every request. You give one specific example of data that must be actively gathered, but you can be fingerprinted fairly effectively through just HTTP header exchange.

You downplay it but as vitriolic as OP was he does have a valid point. Writing is a form of art and putting a registration wall halfway through the article disrupts the flow of that art. As an author, I put a piece of myself into everything I write and I would personally be quite upset if someone did this to my work.
Even ignoring the art aspect, forcing registration annoys your consumers, decreases the percentage of people who read your whole article dramatically, drives away consumers before they become repeat visitors and it doesn't even work.
What ends up happening is exactly what has already happened here, one person registers (probably with a throwaway email) and posts the post-wall text here, where SA makes no money from our patronage.
Even without a wall in the middle, splitting articles into multiple pages is its own special form of nonsense. It may not take much effort to click "continue reading" or the like, but splitting articles gives the site two bites at the advertising apple and inflates their pageview numbers all while mildly annoying you - the person who's paying their bills - for absolutely no valid reason. The added friction of a registration wall just makes this worse.

It includes many provisions, the one I'm referencing is that no one "shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself"
i.e. you can't be forced to reveal self-incriminating information. If the coins were known SR coins then proving control of the private key would be a self-incriminating act and therefore it could not be demanded of you by a court of law.
That's the idea anyway, there's some question as to whether those assumptions stand up, they've been before the supreme court multiple times with this idea and have had mixed results. In any event, this would at least turn the case into a civil rights issue that either the EFF or ACLU would probably love to get their hands on.

There are only a handful of laws that may be relevant to your attempts to break an encryption scheme ("technological protection measures / TPM in legalese) but they all have the same (roughly) list of exceptions. I present to you a short list of the circumstances under which it is legal in the U.S. to break encryption:
* **Educational Purposes** - you may circumvent a TPM if you wish to exercise any of the rights permitted under the Statutory Licence (Part VB), e.g. copy a 'reasonable portion' of a work for educational purposes. If you wish to copy recorded music for educational purposes under the Music Licence but are prevented from doing so by a TPM, please contact the Copyright Officer, as we may be able to provide another copy without the TPM.
* **Assisting Persons with Print or Intellectual Disabilities** - a TPM can be circumvented for the purpose of reproducing or communicating material to assist people with print or intellectual disabilities.
* **Libraries and Educational Institutions** - Libraries and educational institutions are permitted to circumvent TPMs for the sole purpose of making an acquisition decision regarding a work. This exception does not apply if the TPM is being circumvented for additional purposes other than making an acquisition decision or if the work is available elsewhere without needing to circumvent the TPM.
* **Interoperability** - it is permitted to circumvent a TPM on a legally obtained, non-infringing copy of a computer program for the sole purpose of achieving inter-operability between computer programs, so long as the copyright in the computer program is not infringed. This exception does not apply if the TPM is being circumvented for additional purposes other than achieving inter-operability or if the work is available elsewhere without needing to circumvent the TPM.
* **Encryption Research** - a person enrolled in a course of study at an educational institution, or who is employed, trained or experienced in the field of encryption research, may circumvent a TPM on a legally-obtained, non-infringing copy of a work for the sole purpose of identifying and analysing flaws and vulnerabilities of encryption technology, so long as copyright or the work or any other subject matter is not infringed, with the copyright owner's permission. The TPM may be circumvented if copyright owner cannot be located or identified or there has been no response from the copyright owner but reasonable efforts have been made to obtain permission. If permission has been refused by the copyright owner then this exception will not apply. This exception also does not apply if the TPM is being circumvented for additional purposes other than encryption research or if the work is available elsewhere without needing to circumvent the TPM.
* **Computer Security Testing** - there is an exception that permits a TPM in a legally-obtained non-infringing copy of a computer program to be circumvented for the sole purpose of testing, investigating or correcting the security of a computer, system or network so long as the copyright in the computer program is not infringed. Permission is required from the owner of the computer, system or network. This exception does not apply if the TPM is being circumvented for additional purposes other than testing computer security.
* **Online Privacy** - a TPM may be circumvented to protect the online privacy of a person. The TPM can be circumvented for the sole purpose of identifying and disabling an undisclosed capability to collect or disseminate personal identifying information about a person's online activities, so long as copyright or the work or any other subject matter is not infringed. If the TPM is circumvented it must affect the ability to gain access to any work or subject matter.
* **Permission from Copyright Owner** - you may circumvent any TPM in any copyright material for any purpose if you have permission for that purpose from the copyright owner of the work.

Every audience has that serious core following and they're often hard to separate from the rest of the pack. By virtue of paying for my content when they weren't forced to, my hardcore followers identify themselves to me and simultaneously tell me what they liked. This combined with raw metrics helps me focus my efforts where they'll be best received, both by my broader audience and by my core following.

The (extremely common) flaw in your math is that you, like many people, are treating mining difficulty as though it were a force of nature that will keep on increasing forever. It isn't.
It's a market force which is driven by the combined actions of all miners, you and me included. Let me explain why your math is wrong.
Let's say you bought a BFL Single for $2,500, your electricity costs about $0.15 per kWH and you have a SEER 14 air conditioner. If you assume that the Single has an operating lifespan of about 2 years (a common assumption) then your daily cost to operate that single (including amortized purchase price) is about $4. Being a rational person, you aren't going to keep running your Single if its daily returns dip below your costs.
Moreso, you want to make a profit and there's a certain amount of profit below which it's no longer worth your time and effort to mine. Every other miner also has a point beyond which they switch off their rigs, long before they become truly unprofitable. If I could say what that number is, on average, then I could tell you exactly the point at which difficulty would stop rising - I don't, so I can't, but let's arbitrarily say that everyone wants to make at least $100/month in profits. If this arbitrary guess were true, then once net daily profit dipped below the $3.33 mark ($7.33 gross) you would switch off your miner. Beyond a certain point, other miners will too and difficulty will begin to stall.
Note that difficulty is somewhat delayed from the miners' actions and so it often overshoots and does actually result in an unprofitable period before correcting, but that's not the case just yet.
The real danger that current ASIC purchasers should actually concern themselves with is next-gen equipment that is more efficient per dollar and per watt that has a lower daily cost - if a new KnC rig only costs $2 a day to run (no idea what it costs, pulled that number out of my ass) then their bottom line will be below yours and they can out-efficiency you straight out of business. This is the real reason I'd advise against buying a current-gen ASIC: your money is probably better spent on newer toys - but the fact that the new toys are better doesn't (yet) make the old toys bad.

The fan placement actually does work pretty well. There are definitely better ways of getting intake through the front and exhaust out the back but the fan sits below the exhaust grating and has a fair amount of head room. While it may not be the world's most efficient design it does circulate a meaningful amount of air - and despite what the article says it's not particularly loud. It's quieter than the FPGA sitting next to it. The article didn't even get the fan size right, by the way: I haven't actually measured but I know how big a 120mm fan is and this isn't 120mm, closer to 80mm.

Actually M-of-N would increase the amount of data I'd need to punch. Stamping a 256-bit key twice requires that I transcribe the equivalent of 512 bits of data into metal. To acquire the same security level from M-of-N addresses I'd need at least 3 keys, so I'd be storing 256*3=768 bits of data. Combine this with the fact that I've yet to see a really good, user-friendly M-of-N implementation and splitting the key sounds a lot like the better idea.
If, however, you simply want more control over how many ways you can split the key and how many chunks are required to recover data, you could always use [Shamir's Secret Sharing]( to craft your own M-of-N scheme.

If you have the tools (or the money to obtain them) I would personally suggest removing the hard disk, plugging it into a USB adapter an running the forensic tools of your choice from an entirely separate computer.
When you delete files you're not actually deleting the data they contain, you're just telling the OS not to keep track of where that data was and that it may treat the previously earmarked space as empty. As long as nothing has written to the hard disk since you emptied the recycle bin your data is still there. The longer you can keep things from writing to the disk the longer your data will remain intact. There are excellent free tools like Recuva that can scan the "empty" space on your disk for deleted files and possibly recover them, assuming they haven't been overwritten.
File recovery can also take quite a long time, depending on the size and speed of your disk, so be prepared for some downtime. I usually let these things run overnight.

Mtgox prices might not be as inflated as you think. Remember their JPY side isn't having problems so JPY/USD arbitrage on the same exchange should keep the USD price in line with the JPY price. The fact that JPY/CNY is very fluid (regionally) should keep those two prices in lockstep too. Given that bitstamp is much lower priced than converted CNY prices while Mtgox matches them closely, in this one time-limited case gox may be the more accurate price, at least globally. 
Of course since most American merchants use bitstamp prices, it really comes down to whether you're measuring buying power or exchange value, which at the moment are not the same thing.

Fair warning: This is going to be a long one...
I'm David Perry, the author of codinginmysleep.com and I've played with every monetization system that's been put in front of me. I've got some comments on the nature of advertising in general and then we'll get to Bitcoin-specific statements.
Advertising is certainly one of the easiest monetization methods out there, but depending on your content it may not be the best. Advertisers tend to prefer what is commonly referred to as "lean-back entertainment." This sort of entertainment has a couple of common features:
* It doesn't really challenge or engage the audience, it simply keeps them relaxed and in their seat
* It prioritizes viewing/reading numbers over engagement
If this sounds like your site then congratulations, you are one of the few people for whom advertising is a perfect business model. If, however, you create meaningfully engaging content, interact with your audience or would simply rather have 100 dedicated fans than 1,000 random hits then advertising is not aligned with your interests.
The problem is that the vast majority of advertisers and ad networks are only interested in your numbers. Sure, engaging your audience could lead to higher click-through rates for CPC ads, but CPC ads almost never pay as well as CPM and the only thing CPM advertisers care about is your raw numbers. This means you'll be encouraged to write whatever content gets the most views, not necessarily what's going to be the best piece you can create or what your audience will enjoy the most. Advertising leaves no room for niche markets with dedicated fanbases and "dedicated niche market" is a very apt description of Bitcoin today.
I also have to say that I've tried several Bitcoin-based ad networks and they tend to have some common features too:
* They don't usually pay as well as traditional networks because...
* There are fewer advertisers so your ad slots don't get bid up as much
* A significantly larger than average portion of the ads tend to be of the flashy annoying animated-gif type
* They tend not to have adequate infrastructure or feature sets, so there will be a lot of times you won't be showing ads through no fault of your own and you'll almost never have the kind of reporting you want
Essentially, all the problems you'd expect from an ad marketplace in its infancy - which by any reasonable definition of "infancy" describes basically every Bitcoin ad network. Combine this with the well-established fact that Bitcoiners are a highly technical bunch that tend to use noscript, incognito browsers, TOR, adblock and other pro-privacy and anti-ad systems and you've got a poorly developed set of tools trying to track advertise to a demographic that is very good at keeping you from tracking or advertising to them.
But never fear, there are a couple of alternatives that have worked quite nicely for me and another option I'm in the testing process of:
* Direct sponsorship
* Donations
* Merch
Direct sponsorship is, to be fair, difficult to pull off. You'll need an audience before you can even ask anyone directly for money so you won't be making ad revenue during the site-building phase, but frankly you weren't going to make much revenue during that phase anyway. Direct sponsorships are the only kind of ads currently on my site and over time I've had different sorts of deals with different advertisers - My ad slots definitely pull in more money than my CPM/CPC ads ever did but your mileage may vary.
Donations, on the other hand are by far the most successful monetization method I've ever tried. Bitcoiners are surprisingly willing to donate a small amount of money to support something they liked and if your content is appropriately engaging this can be a very successful method indeed. I once created a YouTube video that only had in the neighborhood of 1100 views but had received the BTC equivalent of about $95 in tips - the number of people engaged was worthless by ad standards but they were so engaged with my content that roughly one in ten viewers decided it was worth $1. I don't want to spam reddit with links to the various stuff I use to make that happen but if you're interested PM me and we'll chat.
Finally, I've been told by others who are already doing it that merchandise is extremely effective in this market as well, though I have no first-hand experience to back that up. I've been considering selling some t-shirts or various swag on my site for a while now, but I'm hardly a graphic designer (and my wife, who is, is far too busy on other Bitcoin commissions just now).

Bitcoin addresses already contain checksums. I'm also pretty sure the idea is to communicate an address as someone enters it, not to memorize the address as a mnemonic - though that could be  beneficial side-effect of such a system for those who have good memories.

Actually, giving your private key to merchants has been suggested. Using paper wallets pre-loaded with small amounts of coin and allowing a merchant to scan the private key makes for a simple in-person transaction and as long as you throw away the paper wallet when it's spent and make a new one your risk is limited to the (small) amount at that address.
But yes, Bitcoin does also require good security practices. It requires somewhat less of them because we don't have to worry about the underlying system being inherently flawed and insecure, but it does require good practices.
To be fair, though, it doesn't require quite as much of the merchant if they automatically cash out using something like BitPay.

Oh way more than 30% have something you and I would call a "credit card" but in the majority of cases it's actually a debit card, which CoinBase won't support. Further, even if you have an actual credit card, VISA only has about 50% market penetration, so half of those people will have only a MasterCard and need not apply either.
In the end the math works out that about 2/3 of all Americans do not have what CoinBase demands we provide.

And to be fair, the Bitcoin crash isn't an amount that matters relative to US GDP either. The 2012 US GDP was 15.68 TRILLION DOLLARS. It's pretty hard for any theft, loss, crash, etc to stack up to 15.68 TRILLION DOLLARS.

Some people are gifted with the ability to create things we've never imagined before while others have the gift of modifying what those dreamers create to be financially viable. The light bulb existed before Edison, for example, but not in a form that could be mass produced or that lasted long enough to be worth the cost.
The first kind of clever, the Tesla kind, is actually creating something new. The second kind, the Edison kind, is refining something with a target market in mind.
This is also likely the source of much of the paranoia, fear, anger and hatred surrounding the Bitcoin Foundation and the current core devs: The Edisons have taken over and all the Teslas who actually made this thing work in the first place aren't happy to see their creation being refined for a target market.

It's also worth noting that most wholesalers provide you a certain window in which to pay, after the product is ordered. If your window is long enough (many offer 90+ days) the appreciation in BTC value can often make up your profit.
That's not how we operate (though we do get those gains by holding too), and it's a wager you can also lose, but if your window is long enough you win more often than not and I do know a few people making their money this way.

So assuming your users follow the average distribution that means you're willing to disenfranchise 27.8% of your users as well as the additional 4.8% who only have debit cards? That's even ignoring the Visa-only limitation which stands to disenfranchise another 35% of your users (Visa has about a 49% market share, times the 72.2% who actually have a card). Altogether you're about to piss off roughly two-thirds of your customers...
I understand you have to protect yourself, but perhaps someone should have done the math before pulling the trigger on this one.
Moreover, the fact that I haven't got a Visa card directly speaks to my financial responsibility.

This really only applies to the handful of occasions on which we've hit the blocksize limit. If the total size of all transactions is below the blocksize limit there's no reason not to include them all regardless of fees, it does no harm to the miner and there's no potential for lost revenue.
Now if you have a ton of transactions and they won't all fit into a single block, you take the highest fees first.

I'm guessing that user fingerprinting is part of their anti-fraud metrics, which given the level of fraud anyone offering instant Bitcoin purchases is likely to see, seems reasonable. This isn't an anonymous web wallet, after all, this is a service for buying and selling Bitcoin. If you're upset about browser fingerprinting, you must be livid about having to comply with KYC/AML laws.
Also, browser fingerprinting is nothing even remotely new nor is it even uncommon. You get fingerprinted all the time and while I agree with you on an ideological level (I feel that no one should be fingerprinting at all) you can't really blame a high-risk business for using the tools available to reduce risk.

The idea is twofold:
1) there are always two copies of each key segment, so if one is destroyed there's a backup.

Actually, we all are. If my card is used fraudulently and I report it, the charge is reversed at cost to the merchant, usually not just at the cost of the transaction either, but the cost plus a fee. These costs cut into the business' profit margins and they must raise prices correspondingly. Even if they are insured against theft and fraud, that insurance costs them something and we all split the bill. The cost of theft must be eaten by someone and they always get passed back to the customers. The same holds true for credit card processing fees, shoplifting losses, merchandise peoples' kids break, etc.
It's related because skimming the secret used to spend your money is a problem Bitcoin solves and nicely highlights where Bitcoin's fundamentals are (still) strong relative to those of traditional payment technologies, as mentioned in the 2nd paragraph of the article which I'm guessing you *also* didn't read :(

Well the FTC does [estimate]( that there was a total of $1.5 billion in credit card fraud in 2011. That's still only 0.009% of US GDP, but it's still a lot of money we all ended up paying for goods and services that we didn't have to.
Also, while I'm not sure it's actually being counted, the Bitcoin crash (or more specifically, investors' reactions to it) should affect GDP since gross private domestic investment is part of the formula. I doubt they're actually including our tiny little community in any of those calculations yet, but a truly accurate figure would factor this market in.
Edit to address your edit: Businesses DO care about passing savings on to customers, since if they don't their competitors will. This how markets work and this is the mechanism by which fair prices for goods and services are arrived at: businesses undercut one another until one of them is either more efficient or the rest refuse to cut prices. Lower prices, even marginally, translate to higher sales figures and up to a certain point will, mathematically, result in higher profits despite lower margins. This is how WalMart works. Also, while there are no friendly agencies in the middle to magically reverse payments, merely paying with Bitcoin does not remove your legally-enforcable consumer protections, at least not here in the U.S. Overseas, YMMV.

Back in '06/'07 I worked level 3 tech support for Verifone. During my time there I discovered some disturbing facts about the way the credit card industry works. None of these are trade secrets, just disturbing facts that few outside of the industry really speak of:
* The card readers most point-of-sale (PoS) systems use are HID devices, this means they look like a keyboard to the OS and are vulnerable to regular, everyday, common-as-dirt keyloggers.
* PINs are marginally harder to steal since they're encrypted before they leave the pinpad, but it's only 3DES, which has been broken for ages.
  * Because 3DES is symmetrical and the key has to be in the PINpad as it leaves the factory, the whole scheme comes tumbling down if you're able to do anything low-level to the PINpad since that could potentially compromise the key. Since this is such a threat, PINpads are designed to self-destruct if you "tamper" with them. Unfortunately they're really bad at telling the difference between tampering and mere rough handling, so simply fumbling and dropping one on the counter often bricks it.
* When I worked there, transactions were passed between PoS systems and our payment gateways using Windows filesharing of unencrypted XML files (full card data in plaintext). They've since moved to TCP but it's still unencrypted.
  * They get away with this because PCI and PA/DSS compliance only require encryption on "public networks" like the internet. The fact that it's fairly easy to compromise a merchant's network is lost on regulators. Also lost on them is the fact that merchants have a habit of offering "free wifi" that isn't segregated properly from their payment systems.
* We got a lot of phone calls that should have gone to merchant services companies (we were the phone # on the back of their PINpad, we support all the things, right?) and chief among them were CC fraud, double-charges, product disputes and other things which resulted in chargebacks. In all cases the merchant was the one who ate the loss as charges were reversed, and they were often charged fees in addition to losing the original transaction's money. The average chargeback from fraud was about $500 and the average chargeback fee was about $25. The fees the merchant paid on the original transaction were also non-refundable and they'd end up eating the cost of the fraudulently purchased merchandise, too.
* Credit card numbers were always stored encrypted, but using the same crappy 3DES as the PINpad manufacturers and never salted data prior to encryption. I once generated a rainbow table of all possible expiration dates as proof of concept, informing my bosses that if I had a few weeks and a more powerful computer I could do the same for card numbers or use the available data to brute-force the key. My reports were dutifully ignored until I was eventually sacked for "insubordination" for raising valid concerns. None of this took special tools, I simply fed our payment gateway an XML file containing a bunch of fake transactions (exp 01/13, 02/13, 03/13 etc) and looked at the resultant output in the (shudder) non-password-protected Access database it stored the transactions in. I later discovered that the key was actually plaintext in the source code and could be read from the executable using a simple resource hacker. None of these things are indicative of a well-built and secure system.
  * Merchants breaking their own security to lower fees is also surprisingly commonplace. We saw many merchants storing card swipe data in the (unencrypted) "comments" field of the customer data interface once they figured out the whole "card reader is really a keyboard" thing. They would copy and paste the card data to make it look like a card-present swipe since they pay lower fees for those than for stored/keyed card data. This is, of course, clear-cut fraud and always resulted in bad things when they were eventually caught but that didn't stop them from trying.
To be fair, most of this information is at least 6 years old and some of these problems may have been fixed in that span of time, but given the level of interest Verifone showed toward security in my time there, it's unlikely. The merchant-hostile landscape and ruleset is even less likely to have changed.
I do know, however, (from completely non-work-related events) that they still use unencrypted TCP over the local network for PoS/gateway communications.

This is all true, I guess the point I'm trying to make though is that anyone with a Vegas show isn't likely to say "I have to put this show on hold for my upcoming tour" ever again.
The odd exception seems to be the acts that get their big break in Vegas before they're household names (think Penn &amp; Teller)

Yes, other companies' presence in the space and the extreme delays compounded the problem, but pre-release mining at that kind of scale wouldn't go unnoticed. This is a system with a public blockchain and self correcting difficulty. We all would have noticed if some huge solo Miner suddenly appeared with that much hash power. Such a move would also undermine the entire security of the very bitcoin network BFL relies on for payment and product demand.

I agree completely, my primary source of anger - as mentioned in the article - was not that they wanted more of my information or even that they reduced the limit - it's that I had to find out about this via some other user's random experience shared on reddit. If I hadn't, I would probably have found out while standing at a cash register trying to make an instant buy.
Also, while I don't mind providing additional forms of payment and I recognize their right to change limits it is at least a little stupid that they've chosen to require a form of payment that 2/3 of all people will not have. Eliminating the majority of your potential customers is usually not a good business move.

Even though we hold the coins, Roger would never allow an order to be canceled for such a reason - and if he ever tried I think Zlatko and I would both quit on the spot - it's just not the kind of person he is and it's not the kind of company we want to be.
Even on the rare occasion that I've had to cover a cost and he's reimbursed me in coins he makes sure I'm reimbursed at whatever retroactive BTC price is applicable. Coming from the corporate world it's actually kind of surreal... I'm not accustomed to my bosses behaving like actual decent people.

I don't work for Blockchain directly but I did spend all week manning their booth at Money2020 so I have a little information that might help clarify this issue.
Up until very recently you may as well have called Blockchain the "Ben Reeves Wallet" - it was a one-man-show and no matter what Ben did there was just no keeping up with the huge thing he'd created. Recently Blockchain acquired some support staff. All of this new staff should make things much smoother moving forward, but there's still one little problem: Ben's support ticket backlog was more than any realistic number of human beings could handle and made up mostly of angry misunderstandings that Blockchain had no resolution for. (If my coins were stolen and I can see the address they went to on Blockchain that means Blockchain has my coins and can send them back, right?)
I'm not sure of exactly how they've gone about it, but a large number of support tickets simply had to be automatically closed, there was no way the number of available humans could have read them all. It appears that your support ticket was closed in error, caught in a net that was, perhaps, cast a bit too wide.
Opening a new ticket should really have been the end of this, unfortunately your ticket seems to have slipped through the cracks a second time. The good news is, like I said, I spent all week hanging out with Blockchain's CEO so I've got his contact info and am forwarding him this link. Hopefully now that Money2020 is over he'll be able to help.
Again, I don't work directly for Blockchain, I'm just a messenger, but I am at least a messenger with a really good rolodex.

The non-complex answer: While the community of Bitcoin users has grown quite large the community of Bitcoin merchants and infrastructure providers is still quite small. Everyone knows everyone and there is ALWAYS some kind of relationship-building or back-room-deal-making going on somewhere.

And what country am I in? Therefore which version of English do I speak and which set of rules should I be held to? Right, the American ones. I suppose we should be arguing about "color" vs "colour" or "aluminum" vs "aluminium" as well?

I updated my response to include this, but I'll post it here as well: We had customers circumvent their own security to lower their fees ALL THE TIME. The moment a merchant figures out that their card reader works like a keyboard and that card data can be swiped into notepad, saved, copied, pasted, etc. all thoughts of security go out the window and they think "This will make all my transaction look like they're physically swiped and I pay lower fees for that, how can I exploit this?"
Some even stored the card data within our application using comment fields and the like. That was always a joy to stumble across when working on a customer's database.

Just to clear up the brain wallet chatter: There's nothing wrong with using a kind of brain wallet as an additional backup type. Electrum, for example, uses a single seed to deterministically generate all wallet addresses and can express that seed as a mnemonic. Memorizing the mnemonic is perfectly valid as an extra backup mechanism, but memorizing the mnemonic then deleting the other copies is a bad BAD idea - especially if you're the sort of guy who forgets passwords ;-)
The other thing that makes 90% of brain wallets a bad idea is that they just don't contain enough entropy. Most folks will not be able to memorize a dozen or more completely random words so they'll instead memorize a passage from a book or a meaningful sentence or phrase. The problem is that the English language contains very little entropy so the likelihood of your memorized passage being guessed is quite high.
One could even make a case for brain wallets generated from a good entropy source then destroyed once memorized, but that's honestly not what most people mean when they say "brain wallet" so maybe this is more of a terminology problem. Should we start differentiating linguistically between sha256(passphrase) and mnemonic(keydata)?

Yes but the point still stands. People who put their faith in crackpot crap like homeopathy, for example, are failing at basic logic and the fact that they're "doing it anyway" has no impact on their results.

The danger is that it's really quite easy to tie an IP address to an identity so you've now automatically tied the requested address to an identity as well. Once you've correlated an address and an IP it opens you up to all kinds of privacy-destroying attacks.

If this is even remotely successful it's because people with no clue what they're doing are making brain wallets with dramatically less than 256 bits of key entropy. If you do things right it should be just as secure.
