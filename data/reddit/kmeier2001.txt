Personally i like the idea of having several usable currencies because they all lose value so having a currency with no government control and a currency with government control is good imo. The other thing usd cant be used in every foreign country where as bitcoin could be and shouldn't be regulated. You could make btc banks that insure you coins too. Its alot of opportunity.

They don't tax themselves when producing usd so why tax the production of crypto

The only thing is that when i looked at alot of mining calculators it would profit about 13 dollars a week which isnt to bad and would be a little nice.

Hay ive been scammed for 250 which is much less but its still bad. Sorry this happened. I would recommend trying to do something to figure out who it was and then beat that person with a sock full of walnuts and wet sand. Or get them in legal trouble. Good luck i hope you get your Americanized rubles back.
