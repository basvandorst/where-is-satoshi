thanks, just to be clear, i know bitcoin isnt a company, i was referring to mtgox. i still dont know what they did specifically or what happened with them...

this is exactly what i came here to find out. I've had the blockchain app on my phone since it became available and still have no idea what to do with it. yes i have read the sidebar, im still completely in the dark.

you people are all speaking gibberish. ive just recently started researching bitcoin and i have no idea what anyone is talking about here. but it seems to be pretty dang important. a couple weeks ago when i first started to google bitcoin, mtgox was always one of the top hits. is there any place that has basic rundown of what is happening with this company? somewhere a complete noob like myself can wrap his brain around whatever you folks might be talking about? kay thanks.

a lot what you have described is what i have a loose peripheral understanding of. but ill definitely follow your suggestions to get the conceptual "hooks" in, i think thats going to help a lot! not to unlike the way i figured illustrator out. thanks for your thorough response!

this is what gets me. so my customer cannot pay directly into my account without holding bitcoin himself?

suspicious how? how would you go about having a japanese customer to pay you in bitcoin without previously holding any prior bitcoin?

thank you

i have not. ill google it. hopefully its something i can introduce to my Japanese customer without having to explain anything to him. the language barrier between us is difficult as it is.

its obviously not an application. ive known that for months. being a technology though it still has to have a means of applying said technology. that being said, im having trouble understanding how to use it. i have an idea what a wallet is etc...

i need to get paid, not pay someone else. but still your answer does nothing in the way of providing specific details as to how i would do any of the things you mentioned. fortunately some other post have given me a few specific suggestions as to how to proceed.
