Really?  It is an interesting read and can affect the price to some extent, but the debate is really about the role bitcoin is going to play in society.  The debate can't hurt bitcoin and since everyone debating is pro-bitcoin it is heading to an end in a pretty simple compromise.
Since bitcoin has a set inflation, it is much safer in the long run than this other stuff.

It's called plausible deniability.  Welcome to humanity 101, today we will be discussing the core of social communication.  Plausible deniability allows people to pursue their self interest without consistency, logic, or moral.  If you call them out on their use of plausible deniability, they will shut you out of their social circle and discredit you as much as possible because you are working against their self interest and cannot be trusted, even if you have something they want.
It can occur on a conscious or subconscious level.  You've probably done it thousands of times, no one will really know, which is the whole point.

You mean actually talk to someone?  I've only ever ordered Papa John's online.  Sometimes I will say 'hi' to the delivery guy, I guess.

When I found out I can get 20% off amazon.com using purse.io and bitcoin: 'there goes the last vestige of real world shopping'.

I'd use it.  It's kinda a pain in the butt to use thepiratebay and wait for my HD movies to download.  I don't plan ahead enough and end up staring at a downloading bar.
But I also want to watch HD, I hate streaming sites they suck.

I tried to sign up with my email address... 'email address is not supported'.  I suppose you want me to log in using my coinbase username and password?  ];-)
Edit:  It didn't let me use coinbase either but for some reason it let me use facebook.  I just bought something on amazon with 20% discount...  Oh my god.  This is the greatest thing ever.  I spend hundreds on amazon every month.
I'm so confused!  Why would anyone buy bitcoin at &gt;20% loss?

How do I get papa johns with bitcoin?

I'd like to try it but it's a little expensive.  I will remember it for emergencies where I can't use my phone or skype.

Seems like someone selling 40k of bitcoin in person would be fencing criminal money.

Well it helps that I believe in the underlying technology and am long term bullish.

You can actually get 35% off if you are willing to help people utilize stolen cards.
What happens is, when they first sign up for the site they are forced to buy at 35% off.  The stolen cards get weeded out before their accounts get upgraded to 20%.  There is one story of police showing up at someones house because he did the 35% off and the buyer he was matched with had used a stolen card.
There are many people in other countries who are paid in gift cards instead of being paid in real money, and they are attempting to convert their cards to bitcoin or cash.  That is why they are willing to take a hit on the price.  My other theory is they are buying drugs and don't want to be associated with bitcoin exchanges.  But if you stick to 10-20% off you will always be matched with buyers who have many positive reviews.
