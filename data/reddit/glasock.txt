Okay, here it is.  You know... in case anyone wants to steal my 0 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:25:28
hmm... I still have squinty eyes about this...
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:35:57
Anyway to figure out what the 'proper wallet' would be?  I have all of this info recorded as, "My Wallet" which took me to blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:33:41
so i could still be a bazillionaire?
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:38:15
yeah, I'm definitely looking into it.
and I was only kidding... I know (or learned after you asked) that it's okay.

Lol.... that did it.  Thanks for the tip.  
For about two weeks I've been super stressed about this, wondering how much I put in there and whether or not I'm a secret millionaire. and... 0 bitcoin.... dumb question, if it was fractional would it state the fractional amount?

That's weird; I know I put some money in there. I remember putting maybe $10 bucks in there or so.  Would 'they' remove funds for maintenance?
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:54:24
you and my wife both
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:37:52
yeah, no joy there.  Thanks though

Actually, I transfered that to a new account I created, but it says I need the private key to access, which I think I have, but don't see how to enter it in order to enable that address in my new account.

haha... wait... I wouldn't want to do that, right?
