Perhaps ask around for somebody who can return the coins for a solid fee? Yeah, easier said than done. I mean, if you asked a bunch of hackers, assuming they were good enough to break into your thief's unit, why would they do it for a fee if they could get the whole 11 coins? You could post a request on Craig's List to see if you could get a thug to coerce the thief to send back the coins. But you could easily think of ways it could go badly. Wish I could help you. I hate thieves with a burning passion.

I don't get your nonchalance. Politics of printing money aside, one trillion is too much money (read: power) for one man. I know he can't just withdraw all of his trillion dollars at once, otherwise he'd end up with fiat worth much less. But his wealth will eventually amount much more than a trillion dollars, and he can spend or exchange it in a smart way.

Another threat is innovation - as much as I hate to put it that way. If another cryptic currency but with superior technology that takes care of Bitcoin's shortcomings comes along (e.g. make 51% attack impossible), two bad things will happen: 1) obviously your money will plummet in value; 2) people will lose faith in cryptic currency - "What happened to Bitcoin would eventually happen to Newcoin, too."

Of course it was because it literally was the price. The point of estimating the true value is that whatever it is, it will likely be the average price over a period of time. If the actual price is much higher than the "true" value, it will likely come down. If much lower, it's buying time because it will likely go up soon.

Krugman talked about housing bubble back in 2005: 
And in 2008: 
I hardly read Krugman but after a quick glance at Austrians' comments, I'd say they often take Krugman's writings out of context. For example, they like to claim that he encouraged housing bubble in 2002 or something. I read that column and it's clear that he was simply making an observation that creating a housing bubble would pull America out of the 2001 recession (and he was correct) - not that he was *encouraging* it.

Definitely. But perhaps if we are forthright with shop owners, letting them know that it's a new currency and not quite popular outside the Internet - BUT also tell them that if shop owners like them start accepting bitcoin (without insisting on minimum $$ or extra fees on customers), the general population would eventually use BTC.

One thing I hate about this subreddit is how many commenters talk like teenagers in throes of hormonal angst. 
I mean, sure, if FinCen is hostile to BTC and wants to regulate it heavily, the hell with it. But until it happens, we should take a conciliatory approach to maximize the odds of FinCen cooperating. Even though BTC is beyond government's direct control, it does make things much easier with full cooperation from FinCen.

I'm sure you're right. Yet when the price skyrocketed to $260, most of us knew it was unsustainable. Why? We had a gut feeling that its true value was way lower. Also, the price had come down to pretty close to the median of my estimates, even though they disregard the prices for the past month or so. 
Will see how much longer the price hover around $90, though.

Am curious what you think of my strategy of past few days:
Seeing that the price has been fluctuating between $50-$100, I set limits for buying at the lower prices, with smaller purchases closer to the current price (inversely, bigger purchases further down). 
The strategy is the same for buying, only the opposite.
So basically that looks like this (using the current price of $85):
* $10000 - 10000 BTC
* $5000 - 5000 BTC
* $1500 - 1500 BTC
* $500 - 500 BTC
* $300 - 200 BTC
* $250 - 150 BTC
* $200 - 100 BTC
* $150 - 50 BTC
* $145 - 45 BTC
* $140 - 40 BTC
* $135 - 35 BTC
* $130 - 30 BTC
* $125 - 25 BTC
* $120 - 20 BTC
* $115 - 15 BTC
* $110 - 10 BTC
* $105 - 5 BTC
* $100 - 2 BTC
* $95 - 1 BTC
* $75 - 1 BTC
* $70 - 2 BTC
* $65 - 5 BTC
* $60 - 10 BTC
* $55 - 15 BTC
* $50 - 20 BTC
* $45 - 25 BTC
* $40 - 50 BTC
* $35 - 60 BTC
* $30 - 70 BTC
* $25 - 100 BTC
* $20 - 150 BTC
* $15 - 200 BTC
* $10 - 250 BTC
* $5 - 300 BTC
* $1 - 1000 BTC
* $.01 - 10000 BTC
NO, I don't have this many bitcoins - those numbers are just to give you an idea how I distribute # of BTCs I buy and sell.
One hard decision I'd have to make though is when the price range moves up or down significantly - for example, $20-$40 - I'll have to decide whether I should move down the prices that I'm willing to sell to $40. On the other hand, because I'm not limit-selling that many BTCs immediately above the price, I wouldn't really lose that much in potential profit if the range moves back to $50-$100 or whatever.

Do you really have any idea what it's like to grow up in poverty? People lose mojo fast when all the way from their childhood to on, society signals to them that they're unwanted and worthless.
And please don't give me any crap about welfare sapping will to learn new skills. Even way before the welfare system arrived, poor people behaved the same. Brain research has shown that massive stresses that come with growing up in poverty in a poor neighborhood   (filled with stressors that middle class neighborhoods don't have) appear to permanently damage their brains. 
If you want them to act as rationally as you have proposed, society has to stop stigmatizing them, and guarantee all children some minimal life quality to spare them of the devastating effect of major stressors. If this occurs, welfare for adults might become obsolete.

As long as the share price doesn't drop, wouldn't holding shares be superior to simply hoarding BTC? After all, you'd get your BTC back after selling your shares. It seems to me that the value could increase in 3 possible ways: the share price goes up, the value of BTC goes up, and the dividends. Is this line of thinking wrong?

I mean, can you honestly see the Winklelvii becoming the most powerful people on the earth?
Bitcoin's awesome, but don't be naive. Keep your feelers out. Be humble and cautious at the times of "irrational exuberance."
I'm honestly sharing this warning for your good, because I hold quite a few BTCs myself; therefore I'd stand to benefit from encouraging irrational exuberance.

How would we pay for the police and rights protection? Are you suggesting that we only should do so only if we want to? How would we prevent leeching? What I mean is that an effective police entity would be effective only if supported by a whole community. Otherwise, if an emergency happened, they would have to ask everyone whether they had paid for their services. 
I think instead of doing away with government completely, we establish one that is a true democracy. No phony politicians working against our interests behind our backs, no bs manufactured outrage/issue during campaign seasons, etc. Back then, we had to have representatives because technology wasn't available to make direct democracy a realistic proposition. Actually I don't think it's quite there yet, because the voting process would have to be 100% unhackable (any possibility of applying Bitcoin's technology to this? Hmm). 
Imagine Constitution 2.0 written by a crowdsourcing process. Imagine everyone, after a round of deliberations, having a chance to send in their versions of national/state/county/town budgets, then we basically average them out to iron out the final budget. 
Certainly we'd have to safeguard from the rule of the mob. We can think of ways to do so, such as establishing our bill of rights and coming up with guidelines to protect some minority groups and smaller states. 
Also, I'd support giving as much authority as reasonably possible to not the national level or even states, but to counties. As we have seen, states tend to be ideologically divided even if they vote "red" or "blue". The biggest difference seems to be between rural areas/small towns and big cities. They can get their politics out of each other's way. 
 
Of course, all this wont lead to whatever type of utopia that we fantasize about. Our fellow citizens might vote in a way that disagrees with our wishes. But working with people who see things differently than you do will be always a reality in every circumstance, including anarchy.

Yeah, I subscribe to Sturgeon's Law - 90% of everything is crap. I hate to uphold myself as one of the 10% but I'm really good at betting on NFL games. I know statistics and the game in and out, and pretty much everything I read about sportsbetting written by touts probably would seem plausible to laymen but is actually ludicrous. Not just touts, but also pundits and sportswriters when giving recaps on a game or talking how good or bad a team supposedly is. 
I'm not bragging. I mean, society doesn't exactly put my mad football gambling skills in high esteem. 
My point is that it eventually hit me that it's probably like that everywhere - 10% of experts really know their shit, and everyone else is talking out of their asses and fleecing the public.

Okay, if a stock doesn't give out dividends, what's the point of owning shares of it? To hold in hopes of their prices rising for purely arbitrary reasons, right? Not too different from speculators who buy Bitcoins.

I think he made $200k a year - maybe that was before he relocated to Hawaii. And he had saved up for his escape for a while. Somebody savvy as him easily can find ways to move money around - via BTC for example. Will look up sources after work - my memory *may* have failed me or I'm simply mistaken.

What does "semi-private" mean in this context? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:35:56
Good points.
I don't like the comparisons to the dot com bust, though. It was a bubble because people overestimated the profitability of dot com companies, and it burst when those companies went out of business. No real equilvalence to bitcoins unless a huge percentage of bitcoin-based companies go out of business and bitcoin holders have nowhere to buy things.

Paul Krugman saw it coming as well. What does that say?
Seriously though, am disappointed with the comments here. The OP's point is that you don't have to subscribe to a particular ideology to like Bitcoin, then you Austrians had to come here to blather your bullshit. C'mon.

Somebody posted this advice on - I didn't really believe in it unti I tried it out today. 
When you can't access the trading page, go back to the previous page. Right-click on any link ("Market Statistics" on the right sidebar, for instance) and have it open in a new tab. Go to that tab and close the page. Go back and click on "trading" and viola! The trading page opens up. Weird, huh?
Sorry you didn't know about this until now. Now you gotta figure out whether to buy back promptly or wait for the price to come back down - if it ever does.

Is it *that* ironic? 
Btw, have you heard of a company that went bankrupt because of pirate bay? Got into deep financial doo-doo? 
I didn't think so. You know why? Because almost everyone (95% of general population?) would gladly pay to own a movie, software, e-book, or whatever. 
What makes the pirate bay so popular is that it takes movie/TV studios insanely long time to distribute their movies or shows to the rest of the world. It's so goddam retarded - with the modern technology, there's absolutely no reason they should wait so long. 
And of course it's been found that pirating music has led to new paying customers/fans. 
What about the absurdly high prices Adobe charges for software that is practically mandatory for poor &amp; broke college students? Especially if they major in Graphic Design...~$1k for Photoshop?! Or is that for a package? Whatever. What I understand is that Adobe actually expects students to pirate their software and basically allows that to happen, knowing that students would eventually pay for the full license when they're professionals who can afford to cough up for the license. And they'd be absolutely right. Otherwise they'd have tanked a long time ago.

WTF? The text I entered disappeared. Here it is:












EDIT: it appears that I placed the yellow line at the wrong place: the median of the estimated prices one month later. If I placed it on the median of the estimates for the current price, it'd be ~$70 not ~$80.
Of course, you can download the chart and draw lines of your own, then post your work here.

As somebody who isn't a current 1%er, your statement, of course, has some allure for me. But admittedly, I'm not completely comfortable with the idea of people becoming wealthy and powerful simply because they were lucky enough to purchase some currency when it was relatively cheap.
As it has been mentioned, many of today's billionaires got where they are now due to luck and timing - that's true. But at least most of them worked hard as well.
If my reasoning is flawed, please do let me know how, rather than simply downvoting me or something.

How the hell do we determine the "true value" of bitcoins? What do we base it on?
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:24:43
What about selling with set limits? Would take longer but much less likely to make the price dip. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 02:08:06
Yep. Now how to reach them? Millions of locations...
And many of their owners seem to be in their 50s+ so we can't reach them via internets. 
Perhaps the bitcoin community could design a .pdf flyer that we can print out &amp; distribute to them? We should do this only when Bitpay has a card out (to be used like a credit card).

Whoa. Who says the value's gonna stay this low? After the exchanges upgrade their servers, anything's possible. Think about it - what if somebody offed himself after the '11 crash? Please don't do anything drastic. Breathe. And most of all, it's only money. There's more to life than money.

Right now, you're absolutely right. But wait for things to stabilize again and people get bored from daytrading - just like last May-October.
