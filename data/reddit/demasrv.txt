I don't disagree with you. The discussion used to be very technology driven and now its very "what's the value of BTC vs fiat".  I love BTC and think the tech is incredibly cool but I'm so sick of posts like this that IMHO add very little value.

DO NOT USE BRAINWALLET.
Jesus, just keep them locally on your machine, encrypted or something.
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:23:05
It won't get there unless you all keep buying so BUY!
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:24:06
Yes. I don't want to =(
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:57:33
Thank god some sense.

Someone in Africa can't break into my house and steal my cash. Don't act like it's the same.

I don't know why everyone touts bitcoin as being secure. I know this is an unpopular opinion around here, but it really *isn't* that secure. Every week there's a new story of someone's bitcion wallet getting stolen, or how we need cold storage with paper wallets, blah etc.
When I use paypal or a credit card as a consumer and something goes wrong, I call them up and the processor takes care of my problem.
I love bitcoin, don't get me wrong. But it's certainly not easier to secure than a paypal account or credit card for the average consumer.

backups on backups!
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:50:48
Yeah which kind of backs up my point commenting on this image.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:31:02
I'm sure his reply will be something along the lines of "I appreciate your letter and recognize that bitcoin is an interesting experiment that could affect the future of this country, but I believe we need to take important steps to prevent abuse and ensure public safety blah blah nonsense"

Sorry to hear about this...but why not keep them on a hard drive yourself? I have mine backed up in several places and password protected with something reallly really long.
I can't imagine keeping them on coinbase, but it is unsettling hearing that their 2 factor auth that broken. =(
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:53:22
Get two factor auth everywhere you can!
@_date: 2014-12-14 07:18:02
You didn't answer his question, but just insulted him...
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:54:09
Great summary--thanks for putting this together.
@_date: 2014-02-03 04:28:38
Right--but I'm just curious to how accountants would respond to this I suppose.  Is it like trading any other currency?  Is it like trading stocks or gold?
It sort of presents an interesting problem I guess and I'd like to see some people's thoughts on it that are more knowledgeable in those realms.
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:47:13
It's both. In all fairness, this subreddit deserves some legitimate mockery and ridicule.
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:47:26
They should've included the downsides of the currency too.
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:54:26


Potentially for our pockets.
@_date: 2015-09-06 16:30:24
It's probably because someone took the Bitcion source code and built a trojan into it or something, then released under a web-site trying to look legit.
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:03:53
Ah that's a good point.  I didn't notice you were German until afterwards.  It is frustrating that they rejected you for seemingly no reason.  I used an insurance statement along with my ID.

Keep in mind, everytime you get a transfer you'll have to back the file up again.  Bitcoins are really just private keys.
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:09:33
Yeah but an ASIC isn't an asset you can easily liquify

I feel like everyone here is missing the point of his email...  They don't want to sell more of them, they want developers. By limiting payment options only serious developers are more likely to get them which, for now, is best for their business.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:29:26
I think since technically it isn't considered legal tender anywhere, that it is a commodity. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:43:48
For the rental car discounts? With Hertz you can use their CDP and get a much better daily rate, and they'll wipe any underage driver fees.  =)  Their CDP just went through for me a week or so ago.

Gyft really is an awesome service.  I've used it several times to buy amazon gift cards and it's been extremely fast and easy to use.

Ah bummer.
Their page used to say banking services were available to 'other individuals'
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:55:00
BUY BUY BUY! EVERYBODY SHOULD BE BUYING UP BITCOINS, GET 'EM WHILE THEY'RE HOT!!!
No, but its really difficult to say.  I think it's likely people are stashing right now with the hope that the price will rise. But at the same time, people could be wanting to buy them in case the price does rise.  Really, nobody knows.
@_date: 2013-05-08 17:05:27
Yeah I could just move the client over.
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:41:16
You aren't considering network limitations, any DB limitations and a bunch of other factors that make this extremely complicated to optimize. If it was as easy as using SSDs then it wouldn't be an issue.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:29:59
Really you don't have to be in the military or a descendant of someone military to use their basic bank services.
Or get some sweet rental car discounts.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:59:07
Ha he deleted his comment.  I'm sure writing a trading engine isn't that easy; but I don't doubt any experienced programmer could write one.  Writing one that scales properly however is another story.
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:54:15
This is really frustrating...since my budget mining rig only has about a 32GB SSD.  
@_date: 2013-08-05 22:58:00
Ah missed that. Accepting BTC for the final product would be great.
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:24:30
Yeah...my 660TI gets around 90 MH/s....
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:50:26
Yeah it's kind of tough since this seems like relatively new territory.  I honestly don't really know what it is.
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:18:32
Interesting...but it's still kind of an educated guess right?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:05:14
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:00:37
Whoops. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:10:16
Its a shame we have no idea how many were deleted and lost forever.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:29:02
Maybe I misunderstand bitcoins ...but who's to say there isn't a large majority of coins that have just been deleted or mined and forgotten about?
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:51:07
You had to wait three weeks? I submitted mine last week and got verified in  a week.
