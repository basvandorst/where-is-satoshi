Also, OP didn't link to the full files!
There are actual multiple versions and they're full badges. I think they'd look awesome printed out and laminated :)
edit: Oh yeah and he's totally now accepting bitcoins so you guys should probably go buy some art :)
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:38:42
You're right. Fixed!

I deposited a $15k check last week, it took almost TEN DAYS to fully clear! That's ridiculous.

Mobile? You act like developing countries don't have internet.
Also, weirdly the rights and regulations are much harder to figure out in your country than Nigeria. Not to say that they won't come to most countries soon, and that they're not already looking far beyond that.

Send me your address and I totally will!
Although apparently they take weeks to get here so we've got about a 5-10% chance of me remembering :)

Where does the QR code go?

:) Didn't see your post before I wrote mine!
Andrew is a great guy and an absolutely incredibly talented artist. I hope he gets some Reddit Bitcoin love.

Holy shit I love Android Jones! One of my favorite graphic artists.
Met him and worked with him last year at the 2012 Moksha Art Fair in Miami (during Art Basel). Super cool, super chill guy.
Didn't know he was into bitcoins though!
For those of you who don't know his work, you should definitely check it out:
(Put together an album of some of his stuff I thought Reddit might enjoy :D)

That was a surprisingly easy read. I didn't really need the annotations much.
I never tried reading the original paper because I assumed it would be fairly dense, not general and theoretical like this. Great read!
@_date: 2014-02-01 05:01:14
thanks! ;)
edit: I only wish the trucker hat fit my massive head!

There's a shop near me in a fancy art district that sells these type of things for hundreds, if not thousands of dollars (obviously some are much larger).
These are equally cool, and actually affordable! I might purchase one :)
@_date: 2014-02-01 14:43:37
Lol I'll take some today!
I actually took some last night but my Moto G's camera is of the "potato" variety and I wanted to avoid catching shit from Reddit ;)

See my comment below...
They're definitely not trying to change their billing scheme, that's crazy! 
They're trying to reach customers who don't have credit cards, especially those in emerging markets.

Going to bitstickers now...
edit: $19 later and holy shit wtf am I going to do with all these stickers?!?!?!
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:52:09
Think it's related to the recent localbitcoins.com laundering arrests?

I think this is completely missing the REAL reason Netflix is considering going BTC:
To penetrate emerging markets.
People in emerging markets don't have TVs, they don't have credit cards, they don't have PCs. What they DO have, more and more, are mobile devices and access to Bitcoin.
By accepting Bitcoin, Netflix can enable a lower-cost (due to lower fees) mobile-only version of their service for emerging markets, opening up Netflix to MILLIONS if not BILLIONS of potential customers.
There is no way in hell that Netflix wants to change their recurring billing model, it's an accountant's wet dream. They literally have thousands and thousands of people signed up and paying for shit they barely use (think of your grandparents, etc.).
This is all about reaching more customers, not changing Netflix's GOLDEN revenue model.

A basic feature known as recurrent billing:

It's called BitFriends and it exists:

I don't think people are considering e vastly more complex issue if Amazon accepting bitcoin as opposed to Overstock.
Amazon is just a marketplace for OTHER people to sell stuff. We can lobby Amazon all we want to accept BTC, but the individual sellers at the end of the day are the ones who need to lobby Amazon because they're the ones who need to accept it.
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:40:17
I meant to say they don't have PCs.
You're right, that didn't make sense ;)
My post has been fixed!

Have you actually READ the original Bitcoin white paper?
It's actually a very easy read, incredibly theoretical, and not that dense.
While reading it, I actually found myself thinking many times "This is actually a basic common sense solution to this problem" every time the next topic was discussed.
It easily reads like it could have been written by one person, and the concepts are NOT that complex for a well-educated and intelligent person. I think you are overestimating the complexity of Bitcoin. That's one of the beautiful things about it: it's simplicity.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:09:21
I don't understand...
It doesn't seem to have to connect to the internet? How is it exchanging fiat into Bitcoins?
edit: I assume you have to preload it with bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-05 04:38:43
Can you ask for my 1.7BTC while you're at it?
Seriously though, please update!
@_date: 2014-02-03 02:02:34
Because people only read the top 5 comments lol

Bitcoin is inherently unregulated but the markets don't have to be?
The markets are all a third party system created on the backend of the bitcoin protocol. All they want is a more regulated MARKET for trading bitcoin (according to my reading of this text)
