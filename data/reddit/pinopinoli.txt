my dad asked me nonchalantly to buy some. I did and I kept it for him since August.  
he’s now considering to upgrade his car with dem profits.  
and he had ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA how the hell this happened. he’s giggling all the time, and pls know he’s the type of guy who could not operate a TV remote correctly.  
plus, his involuntary strategy (HEDL by me), outperformed mine basically all the time; it still does. 
my dad is a lucky bastard.

fantastic stuff. I started a little earlier than you, but I feel recommending the same approach.  
my 2 cents are on "never invest more than you are willing to lose": I like to train myself into thinking all the money I invest in crypto is lost by default, that even without that money, I would just go along fine wihtout major hiccups.

I like the plan, getting rid of the bad apple ;)

i highly appreciated your posts but


I know it'd shoot up to the moon, but I prefer you keep your institutional money if that meant more regulations.  
the very idea of bitcoin is to not have regulations, centralisation, censorship and asset freezing.

wouldn't the blocktime stay the same once difficulty adjusts?

cheer up mate!  
all is not lost
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:23:30
yes, true.  
last commit on [btc1 repo]( was on July 21st, I am just afraid they just abandoned the open source thing and are preparing a version to deploy right at fork time.  
I mean, I would totally expect something like this, something blatantly hostile.

you mean GPUs?

lol  
I agree but it's kind of frightening to see this overwhelming support rn.

never had them on Coinbase my friend.  
I have used a Ledger Nano S from the very first investment I made in crypto. they touch exchanges only the minimum amount of time to be moved between wallets.

Speaking of Coinbase, [this post]( from Fred Ehrsam (co-founder of CB) is pretty awesome about decentralized exchanges.  
services like Coinbase cannot stay, they are centralising the shit out of the Bitcoin network and must be replaced by analogous decentralised versions.

I am mining ETH, SIA and ZEC with a dedicated rig, but on another machine I run a non-mining BTC node just for political reasons. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:38:45
I mean, what's shocking to me is that Coinbase (among many) will support the new coin from day one.  
can you imagine the utter chaos this thing would produce? same addresses, surely similar names, very similar nodes. people would buy both unknowingly, giving completely skewed price valuations.
why the fuck is this happening, shiiit.

I am interested in this.  
let's say that on fork day real BTC loses 75% of hash power (I'm just making up the worst possible scenario).  
total hashrate would go from ~10 exahash to 2.5 exahash, difficulty adjustment would kick in and all is well, right?

in light of this, can someone explain to me why transaction fees are not awarded to non mining nodes?  
I think that, even if spare change, would incentivize running full non mining nodes in order to strengthen the network.  
I know it has been proposed already in the past, but I can’t understand why it’s a bad idea (?)
