Neutral here, but - "They dont like it" is not an appropriate descriptor for Haram/Forbidden sinful by Gods word. Nor is comparing it to Lactose intolerance. You're actually the one insulting islam arguably in whatever this point you are trying to make is.

They buy while the sell wall is placed. They place their sell wall, and people start panic selling/are forced to sell under their wall price aka their target price to buy more. Sell wall supress price, buy wall holds price up so you can dump
