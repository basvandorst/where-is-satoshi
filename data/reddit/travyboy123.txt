We are overdue for a recession, historically in the last 100 years there has been a recession every 10 year give or take, and its basically on life support at the moment. Technical analysis of The Dow Jones and S&amp;P500 have triple topped and we just had an inverted yield curve happen 2 times in 2019 (also a major sign of a recession ) Its inevitably going to happen, just waiting for the straw that breaks the camels back.

A blockchain with plans to build a decentralized governance and a treasury will solve those issues, there are a few projects spearheading this idea such as Cardano.

not false, I come from the future and this is what happens. Also you are right, they are not companies but they are platforms, and fundamentally a a cryptocurrency and a business both have platforms, and the people investing into them are still humans not foreign aliens, that historically take sides to their favorite company. Like Ford, Chevy, GMC. ( which all don't exist here in the future, only Teslas)

The need for politicians and governments will be obsolete. We are entering a world we we will not rely on a central figure(s). The entire hierarchy system will be completely changed that we cannot even predict. Picture this, Instead of 1 government with say 1000 government employees working for them (from Monday-Friday 9-5 weekends off) deciding on what to do with the tax payers money, building roads, welfare, ect . Instead , There will be a decentralized polling system with millions of people and millions of smart people creating great ideas while people vote and agree on the best ideas working 24/7. millions of strategic brains working together. 
The politicians better start becoming crypto friendly or they are gunna be left behind.  
The nuclear war was just a way to finish the plot to the story lol

And how many developers are working on Bitcoin? Bitcoin's foundation wasn't planned properly since it was basically the test dummy. Maybe in time after multiple forks they can figure out the major issues but What happens when the bitcoin Dev's find a smoother,faster blockchain with better incentives ? Will they switch over for personal gain ? Not saying Bitcoin is going to go to shit, but being pro bitcoin is the same as a gold investor being gold biased.

Ok it won't be the equivalent, but... will the price of Silver and Gold be given a true value and not stay valued at $15 and $1400, basically the same it has been worth for 10-20 years when the actual Dollar to Gold Ratio = $5256 and Silver Ratio =$644 based on the USD Debt Clock website  [

I am more Bitcoin biased than Gold biased, but lets say Bitcoin becomes the dominant currency and wipes out Fiat currency. I think that would create a huge market for gold and silver as a currency for all the Baby boomers and older generation.

Fair enough, what are you going to do when Bitcoin becomes a shitcoin and Cardano takes its place :)

But the expense far exceeds any gain.
