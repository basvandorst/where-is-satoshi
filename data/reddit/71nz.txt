Yo....... I don't know if this needs to be said but your family also needs to know that "backups of their keys" doesn't mean going to a public place and using the public copy machine. They're going to have a bad time if they do that.

Too expensive. Hardly worth that for a... cookie. Congrats anyway.
@_date: 2014-08-02 04:35:18
Yeah, but, honestly, pricing is everything. If your prices are high just because of a vanity cookie that will be devoured in 30 seconds its hardly worth it. On a scale of weed dealer cost ratio to that cookie you're better off putting that amount of money towards a gram. Just my 2c. That amount is like Airport runway concession stand robbery. :)

All these threads about CheapAir. Just me?
Also, their flights arent very cheap. If you go directly to an airlines website it was cheaper by $150 for every flight that I tested out.

Better question who would pay such an absorbent amount for a fucking cookie haha.

right.......... but pass or fail bitcoin will both live and move on with or without any "approval" and will climb at the rate it has been for the past what seems like decade.
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:12:41
I've been a holder since day 1 so I am not emotionally invested in the rollercoaster that Bitcoin can be for some people
@_date: 2017-02-27 03:09:30
what analysis.. right now its in a neutral state of not being approved nor denied yet and has been doing this for years before anyone even considered an "approval" for ETF. it will climb with or without govt. intervention regardless, but right now its schrodingers coin.

I would, but its realistically not feasible. My miners cost me 300 a month to run in electricity. Have fun!

There is. Voltage Goat does stuff like this.

pretty cringeworthy imo. can still be a fan without having to do that, lol

No, theres too much controversy with 2X.

Like the idea but the design itself is just too basic for me. Wish a bit of artistic flair was added to it.

Maybe the seed was generated with a different coin. Worth trying.

SHAtoshi.. I see what you did there.. intentional or not.
