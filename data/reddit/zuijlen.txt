With a minor adjustment you can point to a bitcoind running on another computer.  
Be sure it is a trusted node/system and safe connection.
@_date: 2015-06-10 04:41:53
You can be sure this keeps working without touching your cold storage:  
Make same (lime locked) cold storage wallet on Testnet (with same version or to ' test out' a new fork chain) and periodically make a transaction.
To more specific: your time locked cold storage keeps working on a chain if the majority of the miners/verifiers supports a protocol including this/your (time lock) function.

Why not consider % of transactions with a fee?
This way users have direct influence in block size by paying a transaction fee (above median).  
With paying a transaction fee users have a vote in the 'free rider effect'/spam and if current levels are acceptable.
1. small block size -&gt; only transactions with fee will be processed fast (others get parked in mem. pool)
2. big block size -&gt; a lot of transactions have a fee and a lot transactions without a fee (spam?) are accepted
3. median block size -&gt; a balance between transactions with and without a fee
Also added a bigger scale (due to near future (holiday) transaction peaks).
I used Gavin's proposal as starting point:  
    max block size = 10 * median size of last 144 blocks * % of transactions with a fee higher than median transaction fee for last 144 blocks (e.g.0.36) * 2

To 'store' bitcoins this (exept previous mentioned unencrypted dropbox) is solid.  
If you frequently transfer bitcoins from cold storage, it's quite a hassle to do this over-and-over again for each transaction.

To prevent someone to hit the key you use, the Bitcoin protocol should be changed, not the type of storage you use.

@_date: 2017-02-01 01:23:28
You should definitely update your knowledge how the bitcoin blockchain works.  
Miners are the ones checking your transaction and without them your bitcoin transaction would not be added to the bitcoin blockchain.  
Miners have the freedom to choose the software they want.  
So your programmers, next to making marvelous software and protocols, need to convince miners to actually use them.  
And after the miners, also the nodes and users.

Hahaha, yes, you are right!  
The question is how willing the miners are to follow user requests.  
There is no direct motivation for miners to do what users ask them.  
That's why (I think) miners come first in the selection of the leading protocol.

If someone (hackers or the service) is able to access your wallet.dat they are able use your private keys and transfer your bitcoins to their wallet.  
So it must be encrypted and in a way there is no single step which is unsecure.  
Next to that, after more usage, there are new private keys in your wallet, and these must be backed up too.  
To use a cloud storage to save your wallet.dat is cumbersome and (if not done well) risky.

Combination of hot mobile wallet (payments), cold storage (2-3 month salaries, stored at home) and deep cold storage (savings and pension, stored in not easy accessible place or multi-sig wallet).
For cold, deep cold storage and multi-sig wallets we prefer Armory wallets (bitcoinarmory.com).
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:09:59
Thanks for your clear answer.  
So, the amount in CT is (one way?) encrypted and only decryptable/viewable with the private key(?) of the receiving address (to check the amount received is correct).
I also understand the miner is able to check the sum of input and output is equal.
I'm still a little uncomfortable not knowing if there will be a specific unfortunate (or lucky) combination resulting in a higher output.
Looking forward to the paper and first tests!
Thanks again.
@_date: 2015-07-30 05:27:52
As I understand from Greg Maxwell Confidential Transactions (privacy payments) causes no one to know how many bitcoins there are, besides the knowledge CT can't create bitcoins.  
I like bitcoin first of all/primarily because we all can see the amount of bitcoins in the system. Just for verification, and also for security. With CT we not able to count all available  bitcoins present (at current time).   
Gavin, do you support privacy/CT over the knowledge of total bitcoins present? And if you do, how is your perspective on security? Because, as far as I understand, we do not instantly know when a bug in CT is used to create (additional) bitcoins.  
Thanks in advance.

They are more suspicious from BTC to fiat (e.g. money laundering), but potential problems seems to be dependent on service/exchange you use.
First try a/each service with a small amount (e.g. €/$ 100) to see if the transfer works and, of course, if the service works (speed/cost/simplicity/identification).

A paper wallet, created on a newly installed offline machine (and never touched the internet), is still the simplest and best option for long time cold storage.  
Due to the plain information of a paper wallet (not electronic, just text on paper) you are also be able to store it in a simple way; a good safe to stand water, fire and theft.  
With the transaction to gain access to your wallet you have to transfer all your coins out (security and anonymity).  
A good way is to start by making 3 paper wallets, one for long time storage (like you did), another with emergency cash (3-6 months salary) and a last empty one to use as your new wallet/address when using your emergency cash.

You are right: with bitcoin it is not possible to fix the price.
