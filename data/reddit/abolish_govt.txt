I did read 4 business days, which means Thursday, not Friday. No, ACH does not take 3-4 business days. Coinbase will probably have my money on Tuesday. There is zero reason I have to wait until Friday.

It says 4 business days. Did they teach you to count in school yet?

The confirmation window said 4 business days. Let's count together:
Monday 1
Tuesday 2
Wednesday 3

The fact that they advertise 3-4 days then deliver 3-5 days is Coinbase's fault not mine asshole. It is blatant fraud if they don't refund me within 2-3 days. ACH isn't that fucking slow.
