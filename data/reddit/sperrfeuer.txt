because increasing blocksize results in decreasing decentralisation. the bitcoin community preferes decentralisation before low fees. bcash people have the opposit opinion. there are no ultimate solutions. everything is a trade-off

i just wanted to point out that even if visa works great it has its own flaws. if the lightning network can create a censorship resistant bitcoin version of visa than i am all for it.
Just because something works great doesnt mean that it can not be improved. Also you should stop think about bitcoin as some kind of static object. Bitcoin is a protocol written in software and can change over time.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:50:59
no it is one of the few real solutions to scale a network based on blockchain technology. if you cant see why scaling onchain only will never work nobody can help you.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:31:27
LN is a multiplier to scale onchain transactions. imagine the average person does 1000 transactions every year. thats 2,7 transactions per day. if you only have to open a single channel to handle these yearly transactions, you multiplied onchain by 1000. this means your 1MB block is now worth 1000 MB without the need to really increase to a 1000 MB block. now imagine there will be websites where you pay 1 cent per article or pay 1 cent to skip an advertisment you dont want to see. maybe you want to buy some ingame stuff for your kids for 5-10cents each. maybe you want to steam a movie online but pay per minute because you dont know if you will finish the movie. this way you can end up with 50tx per day easy. i dont think a 1MB block will be enough. we will have to scale onchain too but without a multiplier like LN these kind of things wont be possible at all if we want to stay decentralized.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:17:28
and while you get lower fees and more transactions per second because of bigger blocks on ethereum you sacrifice the decentralization of the network. ethereums blockchain is bloating like crazy not a trade i want to make. i will use BTC as store of value until lightning will be ready in about a year or two.

if we see that a blocksize increase is necessary we will increase it. its still way better to increase the blocksize to like 10MB Block + LN instead of doing only onchain and have to incease to like 10GB Blocks.

no he is right on that, bitcoin can only handle 4-7tx/s. i also think we will have to increase the blocksize further at one point. however we have to implement all improvements like LN, Schnorr, MAST before we decide to increase the blocksize. we should never try to increase the blocksize in a manner that decentralisation is at risk.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:06:05

News regarding the lightning network are one of the most common topics on r/Bitcoin. I personally use the lightning network about 10-20times as much as i use the onchain network.
@_date: 2019-07-19 09:27:50
yes i know it was increased via block weight. however a block size increase is not fundamentaly a negative thing as long as it is in balance with current infrastructure. if diskspace, bandwidth and processingpower is increased by 2 there should be no negative effekt in increasing the blocksize by 2 also. rate of decentralization should stay at current levels.

A 128 SAT fee doesn't look that impressive but keep in mind that LN-Node operators need an incentive to keep their nodes running. The difference between LN-transactions and onchain-transactions is that LN-transaction fees will keep this low or get even lower. The more transactions happen on LN the lower the cost per transaction while fees for onchain transactions will rise the more transactions need to be settled.

i think Andreas first priority is privacy and he is willing to accept any tradeoff that comes with it. most people don't care a bit. i am in between.
i personally like the approach that we should be able to choose if we want our transactions to be private or not. do we really need to hide our transactions if we buy groceries? if we had unlimited onchain blockspace i would be all for privacy but the fact is we don't. i think sending transactions through LN should be private enough for most things.
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:40:40
you are right but that's why you should open channels beforehand, not while the network is congested. i already got 8 channels open and don't plan to close them any time soon. if exchanges start to support lightning withdraws i am fine. maybe we will have to increase the blocksize if all improvements are implemented and there is still not enough space in the blocks. we will have to wait and see

yes onchain fees are a problem for sure. nobody doubts that we will have to increase the blocksize at some point. there is just no consensus when to increase the blocksize at the moment. it is a thin line between keeping the network decentralised and increasing the maximum of transactions.

steam has nothing to do with bitcoin. they get their money from the payment processor bitpay. You pay bitcoin to Bitpay, they pay $/€ to steam. if bitpay would accept lightning payments, steam wouldn't even notice that something has changed, except fewer people complaining because of high fees. The problem is once a company has abandoned a payment method its way harder to make them accepting it again :( We need LN as fast as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:29:47
think of it like a prepaid visa card. you load it with btc through normal onchain transactions and then spend the money without any or minor fees. if you want to get your btc back from visa card to blockchain you do another onchain transaction. the difference is that the lightning network doesnt need a 3rd party like visa. the 3rd party in LN is a smartcontract.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:26:26

@_date: 2017-12-21 23:12:12
increasing the onchain transactions like bcash or ethereum via bigger blocks results in centralisation. you cant have one without the other. Check ethereums growth of the blockchain and you will see what i mean.

I personally think you should. Invest weekly or monthly (DCA). Invest only as much as you are comfortable with. Prepare that you could get hit by a massive drop in value after you buy. If this happens don't just panic sell. Try not to fall for FUD or FOMO. Invest time to learn more about Bitcoin. After you know what bitcoin is you should be able to decide for yourself what to do.
Btw. It's Bitcoin not BitCoin

How is bitcoin the answer to your problem? Well quite easy. Bitcoin is not the answer for your Problem. At least in its current state. Fact is, blockchains suck for handling high numbers of transactions. We will try to solve the problems via 2nd layer solutions to take the blockchain out of the equation. i believe in 2nd layer solutions like the lightning network. after reading through all the dokuments i could find i think its the only way to go. there is no way around increasing the blocksize on layer 1 but only in combination with the 2nd layer. scaling only on layer 1 beyond visa level would be insane, like driving an oil tanker through a stream.

yes but they will take a fee for taking that risk right? Also why shouldn't you be able to sell/buy bitcoins locked in lightning channels. you could pay 5$ via lightning to bitpay and bitpay could sell those 5$ LN-BTC to an exchange. As long as exchanges start to implement LN-BTC there would be no difference in my eyes. Well we will see

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:56:55
you can take a fee for relaying payments through your opened channels for other people. but its different than onchain fees. in lightning you will more likely do percentage fee depending on the amount of the transaction you are relaying. if somebody wants to transfer 10$ you take 0.01$, if somebody wants to transfer 0.1$ you take 0.0001$ and so on.

I had my coins stored on an exchange for a long period of time. I was afraid to transfer them to my own wallet so they were sitting there for almost 2 years.

you said "the tech might have value but the coins have no inherent value." i just wanted to point out that there is nothing like an inherent value. two systems can use the same blockchain tech. one could be centralised the other one decentralised. one could be capped the other one uncapped. at the end, both will have different values even if the tech beneath is the same. If bitcoin went under you will have nothing just like it is with everything else that nobody wants to exchange.

I mostly see the fees as a donation. There isn't enough traffic currently, that's why I don't believe that any node operator is making profit even if they take 0.15%. Their nodes are well-connected and as long as the route doesn't leave their nodes there is no additional fee as far as I know. Do you know any website where I could get a ranking of the top LN nodes? I know about rankings by number of connections but would  like to get a more complex ranking valuing the nodes by number of connections, downtime, inbound balance and outbound balance.

Yes people get in debt by buying on credit but there is another debt that many forget. There is a general debt that is created by our governments. Whenever the government lends money, the newly created debt is poured down on every citizen. In the US this debt is $58,200 per capita (Data from 31 December 2018). To pay this debt the government can inflate the money supply which will decrease the purchasing power of your dollar savings. They can't inflate Bitcoin, Gold or Stocks.

What you are talking about is a full validating node. This kind of node won't get you any fees or blockrewards. What you want is a mining node. CPU and GPU mining isn't profitable since many years. You would need special hardware (asic miners) for that. 
A lightning node could theoretically earn you fees but at the current state there aren't much transactions. Without enought transactions the fees you earn, will probably be less than the electricity you spend for running your server 24/7.

yeah they won't probably. Still you are insisting that the merchant should send the product and take the risk of the charge back? in my opinion its okay to pay a merchant upfront anyways. a merchant needs to keep a good reputation therefore he won't screw people for long. Single customers instead can screw multiple different merchants without much fear. i dont think bitcoins finality is a problem at all
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:42:02
Yes of course. The thing is that they don't claim that you can win money by playing their game. You just have to pay less if you play good. If you really suck you kind of donate $0.08 to them. I don't see anything wrong as long as they don't tell people you can win more than you pay.

distributed blockchain is the worst database technology you can think of. if your goal is low fee transactions blockchain is not for you. if you want secure, censorship resistant, store of value blockchain is the way to go. if you want low fees and mass transactions you need offchain solutions like lightning network. maybe sidechains which are more centralized but with bigger blocksizes could do the trick.

what you are talking about are simple payment channels. payment channels are only one part of the "lightning network". the lightning network consists of many many payment channels that are connected in a hopefully distributed form. think of it like the architecture of the internet. you dont have a direct connection to the facebook servers but the routing protocol will still get you through until you reach facebook. i want to pay $2.0 to you. if you know bob and i know bob i can pay bob $2.001 to make him give you the $2.0. $0.001 is the fee bob wants to forward my payment to you,

maybe you want to check the off-chain solution called "lightning network" that is under development atm and already available on testnet. 
you are looking at the current state of a very young technology and are unable to see behind what this technology could become. you are like the people that were looking at the internet in 1990. it was slow as fuck. it was expensive as fuck. there was almost nothing to do exept email which was as user unfriendly as it could have been. but look at it now. it took several years to become what it is today. new technology has to evolve over time.

Pro bitcoin:
Bitcoin is more scarce than gold. Supply is fixed to 21million. Bitcoin is fast and cheap to transport world wide. Bitcoin is divisible. Bitcoin can be validated easy.
Pro gold:
Gold does function without electricity. Can be used as a resource in some industrial products.

read the manual carefully that will come with the package. maybe watch a tutorial on youtube. you will propably know the following but it cant be told often enough: write down the 24 word seed that will be generated for you carefully. write those words down on paper or even better on metal (fireproof). whatever you do, never ever lose those words. never never never never ever give someone your privatekeys (seed words) except you trust them absolutely (family members for example).

I remember the graph when there were only 5 nodes on the whole network. There are many things that have to be improved, but I am very pleased with the progress so far. I love it.
Most people won't be willing to run their own setup. I think solutions like acinqs phoenix wallet could be great for most people.

if you are using a hardwarewallet it will show you the destination address on the little screen before you send, so you can check for correctness and you have to push a button to confirm that you want to proceed. i always check some characters at the start, end and in the middle if the transaction is over 100$. never had any problems.

i never claimed that bitcoin will stay the dominant technology. i hope it will keep innovating in its specific field as store of value and hopefully also as a trustless paymentsystem with its 2nd layer solutions. the poster before was complaining that bitcoin sucks because it costs 2$ to do a transaction. i claim that bitcoin is not a static system. it can and will change to whatever is nessasary and needed by its community. what would this world be if everybody was crying about how bad a new technology is at its birth, instead of improving it. bitcoin and the whole cryptospace is currently in alpha/beta stage at the moment IMHO

I don't know but I don't think that a market price below $4k would end  bitcoin. There is no alternative technology that achieves what bitcoin  does (except other cryptos of course).

You compare centralized payment solutions that work on top of the fiat system (WePay, AliPay, Google Pay, Apple Pay) with a decentralized cryptocurrency. That's like comparing apples to oranges. All those could also work on top of bitcoin. If you want to compare them, you have to compare them to 2nd layer solutions like lightning.
If I go down I go down because I choose to. However I respect your point of view.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:33:05
this also makes network decentralisation/distribution much easier right? you can distrubute many small channels and still be able to pay large sums instead of opening one channel to a big hub so that this hub can pay with its high volume connections. only downside i see so far would be higher fees because you have to do multiple payments. if everything works as intended the fees should still be minimal

blockchain doesn't scale. everyone that is not just speculating knows this fact. blockchain can never compete with centralized services in regards of cheap transactions per second. that's why second layer solutions like lightning network and sidechains are a necessity. yes i have read the whitepaper its okay but kind of outdated. there is no need to look at it like it's a holy book. its just a whitepaper.

I think it is noncustodial. It's called turbo channels apparently. I haven't read much about it but it looks like a 0 confirmation channel opening by the one you paid the fiat. As far as I understand this they open a real LN channel with you, push the funds to your side and allow you to already spend the coins while still waiting for channel confirmations. When the channel gets confirmed everything is as safe as it would be if you opened the channel by yourself. This way you can bridge the channel opening time (60min). In my opinion this is way better than custodial because you are only at risk for a short period. Please correct me if I am wrong

I hope you won't reget selling those coins. i i were you, i would buy a hardwarewallet and metal to write down the seed words. you can find tutorialvideos online. those hardwarewallets are supersafe and very easy to use. transfer everything to your address. if your funds are safe you can take some time to learn and then decide if you really want to sell the coins. if you need the money you should consider to sell parts of the coins and keep the rest. but of course those are your coins now. if you want to sell them all you should register at an exchange and start to sell them in smaller amounts. if you sell them all at once, it could trigger a freeze of your bankaccount.

Yes. The hardwarewallet contains the privatekey that is needed to sign a transaction. The privatekey will never leave this device. You create a transaction which will be send to the hardwarewallet. The wallet then signs the transaction with the privatekey and returns the signed transaction/message.

Bitcoins do not exist in reality. in reality the only thing that exists are unspend outputs. these are scattered all over the bitcoin ledger.  your wallet will show that you own 3BTC but in fact it goes through the bitcoin ledger and adds all unspend outputs together. Your 3BTC could consist of 100 unspend outputs with a value of 0.03BTC each. it just shows you 3BTC because its way more userfriendly.
Because there are no real bitcoins there cant be bitcoins inside of a hardwarewallet. they only exist on the distributed network (nodes). infact a hardware wallet knows nothing about amount of bitcoins ore anything. it just knows a private key and the publickeys that are derived from it. the hardware wallet will send the publickeys out to a walletsoftware. this walletsoftware will ask a node if there are unspend outputs for these publickeys. the node will then return how much unspend bitcoins are noted in the bitcoin ledger.
yes. the privatekey can be used with any softwarewallet or hardwarewallet if it is supported to insert a privatekey. 
P.S. all good wallets use mnemonic seeds nowadays. it's easier to remember and has a much lower risk of errors when writing it down. this seed is then used to create a privatekey out of it. we just dont have to deal with a privatekey directly because it is kind of cryptic

But if they accept lightning they would have to admit that their idiology of big blocks is false. As far as i can tell many of the bitcoin cash users are fanatics that will never accept lightning even if it is the logical choice.

1. Download and install a QRCode generatorapp on your phone and paste in the receivingaddress. Scan generated QR with ATM.
2. Print the QR of the receivingaddress to a peace of paper. Scan with ATM.
3. Save QR as imagefile and copy to your phone. Scan with ATM
4. Use any smartphone walletapp. Generate a new wallet. Scan receivingaddress with ATM. After receiving, send the funda from your phonewallet to your electrumwallet.
5. Import your eletrumwallet into your smartphonewallet. Scan receivingaddress of the phone with ATM (would not recomment this).

here in europe your $ are not accepted also. you have to convert them to € first but that doesnt mean that your $ are not money anymore. somebody has to start using bitcoin as a medium of exchange otherwise the adoption/acceptance will never increase

You mean you want a bitcoin exchange account. A bitcoin wallet is something completely different. Be aware if you keep your bitcoins on an exchange you are not in control. your account could be shutdown. Like the others said get a hardwarewallet buy bitcoin whererver possible and send it to your hardwarewallets address

i think nobody has a problem to pay taxes for street lights, police, education, healthcare, emergency measures and stuff like that. people have problems how their taxes are spend besides of those positiv spendings.
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:04:32
That sounds reasonable. That would mean trying to make bitcoin a payment method is a waste of time and we should put the effort into making it the best store of value it can get? I will have a look and think about it.
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:04:16
BTC and Lightning are both capable to do machine to machine payments. the problem for this kind of stuff is not the payment but the AI requiered for those machines to execute payments that makes any sense. However there are a bunch of altcoins that have different pros and cons and it would be nice to switch between them. i think there will only be like 10 coins with a significant market cap in the future

bitcoins price depends on the number of users. as long as there is a way to generate new users by selling coins it will help bitcoin. this will not be the case if it already is mainstream

@_date: 2018-04-17 17:43:15
in a pyramid scheme you need exponential growth of people, joining the system, to keep it stable. There were/are some coins that have this scheme. Bitconnect was one of those. In Bitcoin you only need as much new money/people as the inflationrate, that is defined by the new coins that are created. if more people join than the inflation, the price goes up. it the count of people is not increasing the price will slowly decrease beause of the new created coins. the inflation is decreasing by protocol as time goes by.

Lightning is a solution that works on top of a blockchain and therefor doesn't have its own currency. it is just a protocol that allows you to do do trustless transactions without the need to broadcast it to the underlaying blockchain. the currency is always the base currency were the lightning networks runs on. there is more than one team that is working on different lightning implementations. LN is not only limited to bitcoin. it works on top of many blockchains as long as they support the needed smartcontract capabilities.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:53:41
it's an alternative for optical solutions like barcode, qrcode or datamatrix. i think i would prefer to scan optical instead of using nfc but i dont see a problem in having both

@_date: 2018-04-23 13:57:30
Yes but economic demand should increase if people are able to pay with crypto. Speculation is the main reason why people buy crypto at the moment. As long as you cant use it as a real alternative to the current mediums of exchange, this will never change. The only way to increase adoption is to make the merchants accept it one after another. This will take a long time for sure but hopefully we can reach the critical mass if bitcoin will be ready for mass adoption.

@_date: 2018-12-25 11:18:22
the money is earned by forwarding payments if other partys have no direct connection to eachother. most nodes that are running right now are for testing therefore they don't care much about making a profit via fees. the standard fee configuration is 1/1000 sathoshi, which most nodes use. this is about 0,000000038$ per forwarding. you would need about 26.315.789 transactions to compansate 1$ electricity cost for running the node. if you want to play around with lightning you should.

donations are very volatile. you can be donated 2000$ in one month the next month you only get 500$. services like patreon aim to stretch the donation income over a longer amount of time. something like this could be implemented as a smart contract on rootstock or ethereum i think

That's like claiming you can inflate USD by printing more canadian dollars. Even if they are both called dollar they are separated systems. You can fork of as many bitcoins as you want but that won't change the number of coins on the master blockchain.

I am not mad, it's just annoying. There is nothing to be concerned about. If you aren't willing to pay for the security of the bitcoin network that's fine. Just go and use iota or bcash. Our goal is to scale on 2nd layer not onchain. Altcoins that don't care to keep decentralized will always have cheaper onchain transactions than bitcoin. I like cheap onchain transactions like everyone else but I prefer decentralization before that.
