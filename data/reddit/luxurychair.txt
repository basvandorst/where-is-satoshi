If you transfer to the (coinbase owned) GDAX first (for free), you can transfer out to a wallet for free.

That’s not quite right though. You’d pay taxes only on the gains. If you bought at 1btc 10k and sold at 11k you’ll be taxed 300.  If the price goes down to $10k again (10%) and you buy back in you’ll have paid $300 in taxes and have 1.07 btc.   So you “paid” $300 for 0.07btc worth $700. Day trading is still a losing game for almost everyone so I’d agree with you to hold but you’re not losing 30% of your base on every move.

Likely wouldn't have to.  Transfer $10 USD into an exchange.  Buy 0.00051 btc on the exchange. A week later sell 0.00051 BTC on the exchange.  Transfer $12 USD out of exchange.  There's likely not even a blockchain transaction since the exchange held the BTC the whole time.

In the US the easiest way is probably Coinbase. An exchange like gdax is second and will have lower fees.

That’s a bit beyond my basic understanding of taxes. Consult your tax accountant.

I'm no expert, but this is how I understand it.
Visa processes 150 million transactions per day. (to say nothing of cash transactions, mastercard, etc)
Bitcoin transactions are about 250 bytes.
That's 37.5 billion bytes, or 37.5 gigabytes.  Every bitcoin node would need to add 37.5 gigabytes of storage every day to process 150 million transactions per day to keep up with Visa alone, much less all the other payment services around (paypal, cash, ACH, wire transfer, etc).
This means that it becomes very expensive to run your own bitcoin node (since you're buying new hard drives every couple weeks) so fewer people do it.  Then only rich people or companies run nodes, then those people get control of the bitcoin network and the experiment for a decentralized ledger falls apart.
