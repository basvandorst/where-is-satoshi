Small block idiots are killing bitcoin . Time to wake up people before it all comes crashing down! Yes, on chain scaling isn't the long term answer, but goddamn it we need a bandaid yesterday or BTC will lose to market share and the off chain solution won't matter when it finally comes.

All speculation of course, but I think a prolonged 1-2 year bear market where crypto total market cap goes back to 100-200Bn is a very real possibility.  If you look at past BTC chart, it's always oscillated between 2-3 year bull markets and 1-2 year bear markets for the most part.  Not all patterns repeat, but there's good reason many do -- charts are just visualizations of human psychology, especially in an industry where there's very little fundamental analysis that's relevant.
then maybe the next bull market will be the one that takes us from 200bn to 5 trillion

all the points about utility are even more true for 100s of other coins out there, why would that benefit bitcoin specifically?  bitcoin's only value is first-mover / brand and that's being eroded by BCH hijacking.  I'm very bullish on crypto long term, but not so sure on bitcoin specifically.  go ahead and censor this comment for not saying "omg btc moonzzing!" mods...

BTC going to 2k, thank the small block fools
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:09
what the fuck is this idiot talking about?  Some idiot put in a 6000 BCH market buy order before the order book stabilized and ended up paying way too much for his BCH, but it's his fault alone, not Coinbase's and it's not "market manipulation".  God people on reddit are stupid
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:23:29
I owned 1.7 BTC pre-fork, now I own 5.2 BTC. I'm worried about BCH overtaking BTC with the recent surge and the fact that Coinbase will support next year. Rational fear or will I be ok?
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:30:00
isn't it possible that BCH kills BTC?  This is now my fear as I only held 1.7 BTC pre-fork and hold 5.2 BTC now
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:24:28
Don't be short-sighted!  In the short term, the market is a voting machine but in the long term it is a weighing machine.  The consequences here are very real threats, laughing about "hodling both" is unhelpful at best and enabling the destruction of all crypto value at worst.

No deflationary currency can ever be the **only** or **main** currency, so the answer is never.  The economy only works because of inflation.  If there is no inflation, lending would not work and lending is the basis of all economic affairs.  Ever heard of mortgages or government or corporate bonds or lending club?  These things are the hallmark of the economy and are required for its proper functioning.  
If bitcoin or any other deflationary currency was the only one that existed, these wouldn't be possible because your real debt would grow even though you were nominally paying it down over time.  Every year you would earn nominally less salary than you earned the year before and eventually you wouldn't be able to pay your mortgage.  Thus mortgages would be impossible.
Now that doesn't mean bitcoin won't be very successful and go up 100x in value from here (I think it will).  Bitcoin doesn't ever need to be the "main" currency in order to be massively valueable.  Think of bitcoin more like digital gold, a store of value.  It won't often ever be used for daily transactions just like gold isn't today.  The total value of gold is 9 trillion, and if people only valued it for its intrinsic value of shininess for jewelry, etc then it would only be worth 4-5 trillion, this has been scientifically proven.  The other 4-5 trillion is its value as a "store of value", this is a big opportunity for crypto to take this market share as crypto is a much better store of value.  Gold isn't the only store of value, you should look up the M2 money supply so 4-5 trillion is not even close to the total potential market cap for bitcoin even though it will never be a daily used currency.

Completely new alt coins are totally fine and even healthy.  Hard forks and brand hijacks are the opposite, very deadly!
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:33:22
hardforks are the first very serious blow to bitcoin.  They are nothing to be taken lightly.  In fact, I think multiple successful hardforks are one of only 2 ways that can ultimately kill cryptocurrencies, the other being worldwide governments collectively banning all merchants from accepting payment.
The hardforks reduce the legitimacy of bitcoin and thus the entire crypto system as bitcoin is the leader and the system needs a strong, reliable, trustable leader.  If bitcoin can just be forked and the brand hijacked by any idiot with a couple minor code changes and the new hardforks actually retain some substantial value, the system will be doomed.  No cryptocurrency could then hold a moat of any kind and faith will be lost and ultimately cryptocurrencies will **all** go to 0.  This isn't about whether you like bitcoin or one of the forks better, supporting the forks is literal crypto suicide for all of us.

let's be real, we live in a capitalist society.  The average person spends 70% of their waking hours in activities directly related to acquiring capital (money).  It's only rational for anyone who wants that 70% of their life energy back to want to get rich.  Maybe when the robots take all the jobs and we all get paid by the welfare state to sit around and read reddit and play video games people will be free to care about other things more than money, but in 2017 $ is king.
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:28:01
This one is very different in that it's a hard fork with prominent folks with deep pockets in the community supporting it. It is the first real threat, market giving it 20% chance of killing BTC at the moment
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:16:47
Just buy every time you have spare money no matter what the price and hold to either zero or retirement. Just don't put more than 25 - 50% of your net worth in crypto as zero is a real possibility. Put the rest in index ETFs and real estate.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:22:20
it's "evil" because they are pumping a dangerous fork that if successful could literally destroy the entire crypto world.  The legitimacy of the entire space would be disrupted if it was proven that bitcoin can be forked and hijacked by any idiot with very few code changes.  It would mean bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general have no moat and thus ultimately they have no value as the value is 100% **only** based on people's trust that it will retain and grow its value over time.  the fork that will not be named is threatening all of that and users are endangering the entire crypto world in their attempt to make a quick buck off this Korean pump and dump
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:51:30
if the flip happens, it will be the end of BTC in the long term.  good for you if you own both, but that would be terrible for us that have bought BTC since august 1 so the panic is real.  Also, a hard fork success would set crpyto back years, another 3 year bear market on the way as people lose confidence in the leader.  
If flip succeeds, I predict total market cap of BTC + BCH to drop to under 20B, so I wouldn't be so cavalier about it if I were you
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:57:17
A hardfork is only acceptable if it can get 100% support and only one token comes out on the otherside that is still BTC.  A hardfork with partial support is highly dangerous.

I buy every time I find some spare change, I don't try to time the market.  Hodling until I'm retired at which point I'll sell 1% per year for living expenses

2000 unfortunately, thanks to core that won't even let us talk about a near term scaling solution
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:43:02
This is pyramid scheme mindset.  Fundamentals matter.  BTC fundamentals are deteriorating daily while alt coins continue to meet market demand.  BTC will got to 2k or less and stay there until there is a solution to the scaling problem.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:46:49
Fools like you are causing BTC to lose market share. BTC is not doing fine. This is a legitimate crisis. Not talking about the still bloated price, talking about how BTC will die if we don't at least get a scaling bandaid in the short term
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:48:55
Bitcoin will not rise again until it has a definitive near term solution to the high fee problem.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:43:57
The time was yesterday. 2mb would at least cut problem in half for the near term. Something's gotta give or BTC is going to lose too much market share.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:12:24
Don't worry about it. In 5 to 10 years it will either be 0 or 1 million. Great risk reward under 100k per coin
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:53:13
Fuck and fuck BCH, but anyone who doesn't admit that BTC has some real problems right now is fucking crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:29:02
If this ever becomes the official opinion, I'm selling all and moving to some alt that cares about transactabality. Bitcoin has no value if you can't transact easily. Gold has inherent value. I agree it could steal a lot of gold's market share in the long run, but ONLY if the scaling issues are solved. Otherwise it's going to 0 and people like you will be the cause.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:41:19
It's going to keep dropping to at least 2k.  It will only come back if the scaling issues are solved.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:50:16
Yes that's true that their fix is only a bandaid, but it's still a very helpful bandaid in the short run. It's ok to apply bandaids for now until we find best solution years down the road. But if we do little for next 2 years it takes to get LN, it will be too late as BTC would have lost way too much market share by then. At the end of the day, BTC is only dominant due to first mover advantage. That can erode quickly with high fees. People *hate* fees, even if it's a small percentage of the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:40:40
Blind arrogance. BTC has real problems and core is moving too slowly. Rome once thought the same thing.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:23:16
If bitcoin doesn't solve this issue in the near future, it will lose a LOT of market share.  Anyone here who says otherwise has drunk way too much Kool Aid.  The time is  now to act aggressively to fix the scaling issues and lower fees!
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:28:21
who cares about the daily fluctuations.  invest for the longterm.  However, with that said, either Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash will succeed long term and not both.  You  should own both for a hedge.  Both subs are stupidly biased.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:52:14
It's true, this sub is now toxic.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:45:24
Why would it go higher?  Fundamentals are finally catching up with it.  It should fall down to 2k and stay there a long time until the scaling issues are resolved or at least a bandaid is applied in the meantime that appeases the market.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:16:02
In 5-10 years it will either be worth 0 or 10k, good risk/reward and good start :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:42:57
You'll get your wish in a week at 2k, then it will hover between 1-2k for the next 2 years until LN can roll out.  The fundamentals are finally catching up to BTC.  Only thing that can prevent is for devs to move aggressively for a near term solution.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:11:52
Yes people want bigger blocks.  But you will be banned from this sub if you make you so much as mention that fact.  This sub is doing much harm to the BTC cause
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:50:18
1000-2000 and stay there a lot longer than 10 days--**unless**--Core announces plans for a near term scaling solution.  We don't have fucking time to wait for LN.  Crypto is moving too fast and BTC's only advantage is branding and first-mover.  We need fundamentals here and scaling is in demand.  The market has spoken.  I'm still all in on BTC, but Core needs to respond yesterday.

Don't use GDP use M2 money supply. Same order of magnitude tho, but remember that valuation means no other currencies fiat or crypto have any market share. 1 million is more realistic cap assuming BTC can get about 1/3 global market share. They have to solve the scaling issues to get anywhere close tho. Small blockers don't help.
