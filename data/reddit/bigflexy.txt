51 percent means your miners decide which block is in the chain.
If your rival makes any blocks, your miners ignore rivals chain and decide consensus on your chain.

"When you can code what they can code, you can call it what you want." 
I'm not saying it's one or the other.  I'm saying, when you write something, you can name it.  
That doesn't mean that people don't organize and agree to come together to build projects and agree upon name.  
Which is what you are describing.  So the programmers that programed reddit agreed to name it reddit.  Programmers that worked on Microsoft Office agreed on the Name too.  I'm sure marketing had some input.  Takir and Will wrote something and they called it dark market. 
Is he not allowed to name it?

Here's a short check list off the top of my head...
* Get a bitcoin client for your phone.
* Make sure it's synced to the block chain before you head out to buy your coins.
* Arrive at pre-determined location.  Maybe a place that sells beer or coffee.
* Show him the money.
* Ask him to deposit to the address on your phone.
* Finish your beer or coffee and wait for 2 conformations. (Approx 20 mins.)
* Hand him the money.  
* Task is done.  
* You can leave now. 
Also advisable to let him know how you will be doing business so that there is no confusion. 
Good luck...

Think we need new language to describe these events.  When I think of crash, I think of: You crash your car, it's never the same again.
But bitcoin does it's honeybadger thing and does it's own thing.
But when you say bitcoin crashed I think that it can't be because it hasn't failed technically. 
As I can see it, this is a technology adoption we are watching here and it happens in waves. In what I think I could describe a person drawing in air. You have to expel first before you can make room for more.   
So my language would be that Bitcoin is breathing out.  
Your crash to me is a part of the rhythm of bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a Honey Badger...  It will still function.  
Publish your address next to your identity online and you shot your self in the foot. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:13:36
Uhhhg Amir again.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:39:49
I'm with you on that one
@_date: 2013-06-18 18:43:01
If you want the trail to be difficult, use coin laundry and a new wallet.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:55:44


Only the author can sign that coin.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:48:10
If the device fails or is lost, how do you recover your keys?
@_date: 2013-03-04 14:22:42
Satoshi outlined a fix for this in his bitcoin paper.  Swap out old algorithm.  Generate new wallet.  send btc to new wallet.  move on. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:42:50
I'm sure that's a free speech issue on the advertising and contract law on what they accept.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:40:20


Just to add to this:  Because I can by 1 cheese burger with a dollar this year and .8 of next year, you would want to either spend that money right away or park it somewhere where it can at least still buy you a full burger 1 year down the road.  
 
@_date: 2013-03-07 21:22:41
great.  I'll buy some up when the price drops.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:12:24
I prefer to go by "Easy come, easy go".  But I wouldn't call anyone an idiot for putting skin in the game. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:39:14
I read the headline.  It's not wrong.  I still ain't watching Amir Takki.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:56:01
Blockchain is the public ledger of bitcoin.  Your bitcoin is valuable because people want to pay money for it.  People want to pay money for it because they see utility in it.  
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:44:37
I don't think other exchanges will be able to handle the volume Mt Gox does.  We'll see what happens.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:38:03
\o/ YAY
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:05:41
I got the communication.  How did you miss it?
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:56:03
There was a frenzy after 100.  I recommend ASAP.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:09:29
That's 10 PM eastern tonight.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:26:58
The Cyber Christ!  Someone alert Max Kaiser! 
@_date: 2013-03-21 13:15:42
Let us say you have a chart.  This chart shows the participation of users. It could be of anything.  The internet circa 90's, Torrent clients, paypal users, google use. 
Now let's say you have another chart of various stocks over the years.  Apple, Black Berry, Google, and just about everything else.  
Now you have Bitcoin.  Which chart do you think is more appropriate to use and why?
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:24:43
Ask them.  But you have choice.  If you don't like them (for whatever reason), then don't do business with them.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:49:33
No, because at some point at the spiral it will be worth running those machines again.  
@_date: 2013-09-23 18:32:52
Ummm I haven't got that far yet :(
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:55:16
Some banks offer a deposit only account.  Just FYI. 
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:32:58
When I bought my condo, I had to fill out a form declaring the legitimacy of 6 thousand dollars I deposited in my bank account for my deposit.  My point; Cash may not be banned yet but they are trying hard...
@_date: 2013-03-01 19:29:02
Beanie Babies...
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:59:19
Justified and ancient? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:38:02
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:27:05
No it won't.  They will run out again.
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:36:35
They don't enter the (what I call) governmental money systems.  If it's not getting changed over to USD/EUR/CAD or whatever and just getting washed, no agency can really have jurisdiction over that.  I don't think there's any legal leg to stand on.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:19:22
7 confirmations is how many blocks it's buried under.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:52:08
Am I to late for the circle jerk?
@_date: 2013-05-22 02:53:15
I heard AMIR TAKKI and I just closed the window...
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:06:27
Says you...  My bitcoins are more useful when they are worth more than worth less.
@_date: 2013-03-20 20:25:37
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:41:44
Needs to be 100 by Saturday...
@_date: 2013-03-07 11:48:59
Evidence?  
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:37:33
You're quick to judge.  If it hits 1500 by July, would you call him a genius?
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:06:34
Your bitcoin wallet is not insured.  
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:48:04
Well it is satire...
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:55:43
What is this idea of stable multinational bank?  I get what your saying, but I thought about the HSBC thing with the laundering money for the Mexican cartels.  And I thought about the 2008 bail out.  And I thought about Cyprus.  The idea of stable multinational bank doesn't resonate with me.  It sounds preposterous to me now.  
Here's the value in bitcoin regardless of any sanction or law brought to bare on it.  A ledger that can't be forged through cryptography/mathematics and also can't be destroyed because it's distributed.  Previously, it was the banks job to look after accounting on ledgers.  Now you can do it over the internet without a bank and trust that it will be secured to an open standard that everyone can check. That's big.  Even paypal needs banks. Bitcoin needs neither but can play nice with both.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:51:21
In a practical sense, if I was a miner, why wouldn't I just launder the coins and sell them on an exchange?  I imagine it would be difficult to prove that I mined them.  
@_date: 2013-01-31 04:32:58
Should have titled it Bitcoins are not vegetables..  Ouch with the down votes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:21:47
What is the largest bull market in history?
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:07:21
Luck favours the bold.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:10:23
they have to wait for the trial to conclude before they do that.
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:00:38
When the tools are in place and it's as easy to deploy like a wifi adapter, you will see a huge explosion.  
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:26:08
Either do business with them or don't.  
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:26:17
To the moon!!! ┗(°0°)┛
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:54:10
Probably not.  Don't think BTC falls under any government jurisdiction. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:44:23
Going to book mark this and come back in 4 months.  I think this idiot probably hit the jackpot.  4 months will tell. 
@_date: 2013-02-15 20:19:29
I've used them before.  Never had any problems.  I've bought over 100 bitcoins over the years with them.
@_date: 2013-03-19 05:32:57
Miners will move operations off shore.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:31:21
They do.  Last 3 times I got my deposits credited within 2hrs.  One time it was 10 mins. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:38:54
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:13:38
It's [Erik Voorhees]( speaking.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:35:44
But do you tell emigration about your BTC? Obviously you don't.  So how can you stay in the country without eventually getting kicked out?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:42:47
In for a penny, in for a pound?  
@_date: 2013-06-15 17:08:32
I got some yesterday. Should have put in some more money.
