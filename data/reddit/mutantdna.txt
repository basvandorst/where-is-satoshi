Genuine question, what makes this different/better to blockfolio? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:40:43
I would bet my entire holdings on it NOT hitting 100k in 2018.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:40:32

@_date: 2018-01-29 17:53:19
Ok pal, gonna try it out and will report back 
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:18:47
Not yet, when it goes a bit lower I will
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:02:29

So far it looks superb. I can't get gdax api to work with it though, and the read only prompt should only be shown once. Need more time with it to evaluate properly, and no ideas on gdax either unfortunately.

Agreed, along with HODL and the stupid rollercoaster.  This entire sub is 90% juvenile. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:25:07
And this sub is full of negativity to I'm pro bitcoin and don't have an interest in bch, however to suggest this sub is in any way better, is a joke.

Unlikely, this sub is just as childish as @_date: 2017-12-23 10:56:54

UASF sounds like a much better idea than current, whereby miners dictate the rules.  I'm absolutely certain I am missing something fundamentally huge, since I only have a very basic understanding, however I never really liked how miners control the decision making.

@_date: 2017-08-11 08:40:31
I don't really understand your post to be honest.  1BTC will always be 1BTC.  If you are buying a little BTC each month, then of course you are getting closer to owning a full bitcoin.  It's not running away from you, it's just going to take longer as the price rises.

Confused me also to be honest.  GDAX is also about 100€ better price than Kraken.

@_date: 2017-11-02 08:15:25
I think I understand your confusion and subsequent aggression due to frustration.
I'll try and explain the word 'predominantly' to you....predominately means much the same in this context as majority. Example, reddit is predominantly full of useful users, however there are a few total retards in the mix - make sense? 
Perhaps to use your own word, 'statistics', you would understand that just because some businesses accept bitcoin, that does not mean that statistically payments are the major use.
Anyone that knows even the slightest bit about crypto, understands that right now, bitcoin is a poor payment processor. Of course some will use it, but they are in the minority.
I hope this clarifies things for you and you aren't so angry now. Xx
@_date: 2019-02-01 09:15:11
Don't really get this. Celebs who have nothing to do with crypto, I mean Biggie dead what, 20+ years? Twitter handles doenst make it better, seems just very amateur altho the actual artwork is great, just the significance sucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:02:10
Brilliant thanks! I cashed out, put it in bitcoin and made a killing :) 
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:16:52
Aggressive little fella on the Internet aren't you. As much as I'd like to bow to your demands, I can't be arsed. By the way, look up the word 'statistics', you clearly don't understand it's meaning and it makes you look even more stupid than you already do. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:05:21
I would go elsewhere, rather rapidly
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:21:24
Unfortunately I've been looking forward to this for a long time, however I see absolutely zero reason to choose this (or the original Trezor), over the superior Nano imo.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:12:08
You're not the only one, it's dumb as hell.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:58:15
Get your funds and coins out, I expect they will close doors permanently soon enough, they seem to be turning into a complete scam.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:08:37
Fair point, I agree that is poor qa. I'm actually of the opinion hardware wallets like both of these are over hyped. I believe they appeal most to newcomers, but out of the two, nano would be my preference. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:43:03
Maybe try reading at least the homepage of their website?!
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:17:28
Well it did, less than a week ago...

You cannot fill orders on Kraken, ignore their prices
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:07:39
It's shocking how poor their systems are, its the same every time there is significant movement.
It's also breaking my Blockfolio app since that uses their API.
Horrible horrible platform, they should be ashamed that the same complaints have gone on for years.
@_date: 2019-12-29 12:43:48
Some nice made up quotes there, but let's not let that get in the way of some good old fashioned bs!

@_date: 2017-11-05 18:40:35
Very true, and goals, expectations, current circumstances etc
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:55:39
I feel your pain, that is a very accurate account!
I have had that exact same scenario, but when chasing movements.
You can imagine the carnage when an order you were trying to place minutes earlier, during a massive price swing, suddenly gets laid when you gave up on that price quite a while ago!!!
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:43:48
This is hilarious, how have I never seen this before?! 
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:08:37
Sell, by back at 6000, its not much but at least you'll be taking a dent out of your current loss. Keep doing that and trading the swings.

Totally his fault, why should Kraken be out of pocket because he can't send to the right wallet?
It's not like they can retreive his bitcoins, they are gone, floating in nowhere as he says, so the problem is 100% his, and I support krakens response fully.
Furthermore, the title of his post is misleading and libelous, kraken have NOT stolen his btc, he has sent them to a wrong address, so no one has them now.
Posts like this make me furious, typical 'not my fault, I'm the victim' mentality, I hope Kraken stand strong on this.

Do-able, and better than many other options, but not the best.  First of all, I would prefer an IOS device for this (I'm Android, but IOS is more secure for this purpose imo).

This just looks like one big scam, the website has 404s and everything requires a fee of ETH.  No thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:06:16
A hardware wallet is more secure if you are transacting with bitcoin.  If you are simply holding, it is no more secure than a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:10:47
I really don't buy into the security of these hardware wallets anymore, since the real question is, "where do you keep your backup seed"?
It's pointless securing your Trezor/Nano/Whatever, if your backup seed is written down in any insecure place.
Futhermore, the plausible deniability is totally useless too, since any attacker is going to expect the second "nearly empty" wallet.

I cant wait to see what price it trades at, if at all! 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:31:16
Couldn't have said it better. Summary for me is that for holding, hardware wallets are pointless. For spending, they have their place. Nano would be my recommendation. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:10:32
I know, but it's incredibly played out, not witty or funny, and just makes this entire sub look childish. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:36:14
I was worried it might be a scam until you mentioned it was legit.  You have however made a slight mistake.  You asked for $20, but the link wants 20BTC, but since it's legit I'll go ahead and pay 20BTC anyway.

Of course the other cryptocurrenices would like this, but it's no easy feat to achieve.  Bitcoin is the most widely known CC, and even that is a very small percentage of the population, and it's a slow read even for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:54:46
Except bitcoin unfortunately isn't actually used that way by many people at all. It's predominantly a storage of wealth, not a payment system as it currently stands. Regardless of that, if they are not for storing as you say, that suggests they are an inferior method to store, and also goes against all their advertising.

Not true.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:37:23
Well this is just my opinion and I stand to be corrected, however securing your private key is still the fundamental most important part even with a hardware wallet. Backing up your seed must be done with utmost caution, so essentially that makes a hardware wallet no more useful than a paper. Where the hardware wallet becomes more useful, is in spending or moving funds, which with a paper wallet is more risky, however the hardware wallet does a very good job.
I persoanlly would think of it as a convenient and secure way to carry bitcoin around should you wish to use it as a currency. If you simply want to hold, then it's pointless spending the money on that device. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:35:05

So they are impartial. It's not really what I would choose, but that's kind of the point, they are not forcing a choice. You can however, manually point to any node you wish, and therefore take the decision yourself.

Thank you for this, very educational.  What does this mean for the less clued-up end users?  For example, my funds in my wallet, do I need to do something in particular?  I think I heard different wallets are taking different sides, which could be very risky for those that don't really understand the impact of all this.

BCC will go to nothing is my guess, so the only real time to dump it will be immediately, that's if the exchanges will allow it.

This is a good option, even better if you have an unused device you can put in a safe.

Sure about that?
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:53:16
Yes perfectly safe imo, I use it for more than that
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:03:21
Disagree. We're going to see it fall much lower over the rest of July imo.

Sweet baby jesus, I'm sat on the toilet fucking crying my eyes out, that was absolutely hilarious. The bit with bitfinex carrying its broken tether arm ������������

Unfortunately not, I guess all you can do is just try different banks, as every single one has at one point got reports of shutting accounts due to bitcoin transactions.

The problem with Fidor is they don't accept the faster payments scheme yet, so transfers can take 2 hours (in business hours), and that's not useful for selling.

I can buy as much or as little as I want, what exchange are you on?
