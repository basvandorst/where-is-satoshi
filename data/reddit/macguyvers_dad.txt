Yes, there are fees when you send from the hardware wallet.

I withdrew 1 BTC from GDAX today with no fee.  Use GDAX for all your transactions, not Coinbase.  You can easily transfer from your Coinbase wallet to your GDAX wallet, then withdraw into your hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:23:58
I use GDAX for BTC to USD, and use limit buy/sell orders for most trades.

Looks like people have addressed the crypto part of your post, but be wary of scams if you choose to do drop-shipping.  That shit is scam city.

So is Bitcoin Cash being removed, or just forks of Bitcoin Cash?  The language in the post is unclear to me and keeps making references to “Bitcash”.
Edit:  nvm, I reread and saw that they referred to BCH as “Bitcash”

Does the screenshot not make sense to you?




Bitcoin plus, Bitcoin private, and other Bitcoin forks do not do those things.  This seems pretty goddamn clear cut.

Yeah, USD is worthless.  Tell that to your bank.  The only reason 99% of people own crypto is because of its potential for monetary gains, gains which currently occur most usefully with fiat pairings.  Let’a face it, of BTC was worth like 10¢ nobody would care about the exchange rate of your favorite alt vs BTC or any other crypto.  The valuation that matters is the one against a fiat currency like the USD.

It seems the “shitcoin moniker” on that site is reserved for more egregious examples, ie coins which are likely scams or have especially malicious elements associated with them.
The other Bitcoin forks don’t appear to possess the goal of “do everything possible to undermine BTC”.

Posted this elsewhere:
The price of BTC fucking plummeted by over $1000 the second BCH was added to Coinbase.  I know I’m not the only person who was on Gdax at that moment when suddenly the price goes from $18500 or so to low $17000s in about a minute.  Then Gdax website goes down for many, only to come back up 30 min later with BCH added.
The crash all the way down to $8000 began the literal moment BCH was added.
Look [here]( at the price of BTC in Dec 2017.  BCH was added to Coinbase on Dec 19.  Check out that huge $6000 drop.
Additionally, there is the issue of the price of BCH surging to over $8000 on Coinbase in under an hour after it was added, despite the fact every other exchange was trading it for around $3000.
This is all my personal interpretation of the events btw.

Germans by and large don’t even use credit cards.  I wouldn’t bet on Germany completely ditching fiat and banking exclusively with crypto wallets within 20 years.
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:44:28
I qualified that statement with the word “essentially”.  I know you’re not giving yourself a loan.
You should look up credit card interest rates and compare them with personal loan interest rates.  Personal loans often have significantly higher rates, yet I’m sure you don’t think loans are a “racket just cuz”.
Also, Visa is used to facilitate payment processing with your debit card, not to run some kind of interest scheme.  Visa is a global card network, and having a debit card with the Visa logo allows you to use that card on that global network.

It keeps new money from wanting to enter the space when you don’t know what to put your money into.  Most alts have absolutely zero history, so it’s not like you can just research it like researching a stock, aside from reading a white paper.  Furthermore, there has to be trust in the security of the coin.
People want to put money into a cryptocurrency which they think currently has and will continue to have usage and growth.  What “usage” means is another story (ie “I can’t use BTC cuz tx fees”).  
Any crypto could have the absolute best idea ever, but if it doesn’t grow then it’s not any good for any investor.  The market graveyard is filled with corpses of companies with great ideas that never took off, for whatever reason.

@_date: 2018-03-03 04:12:23
Not exclusively at all.  But there was a flash crash immediately following BCH being added.  The trend obviously continued downward for almost all cryptos from there.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:47:08
If you take a crypto and create a hard fork, and the original version is still the original version, how is the new crypto (which is different from the original) created from the fork suddenly the original?  Especially if it has far fewer users.  None of the Bitcoin Cash argument for calling itself REAL Bitcoin makes sense.  They can call it an improved version if they feel like, but it’s still a different version from the Bitcoin it forked from.
I like to think of it like forking a process in unix.  When you fork a process there is a parent process and a child process.  If cryptos forked like processes then Bitcoin Cash would be a child of Bitcoin.  Granted, the analogy doesn’t work 1:1, because there is obviously no such parent/child hierarchy at work.

Hence added “potentially allegedly”, as there may be potential for an allegation.

What a dumb thing to say.  Of course someone who owns BTC wants everyone in on it and the price to go up.  Same with every cryptocurrency or asset that has ever existed.
Why would anyone not want to increase their purchasing power and net worth?
Also, you should research the term “pyramid scheme”.  You may be right that BTC never again reaches those highs, but it’s definitely not a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:23:33
It’s not a record breaking freefall unless you don’t know math.  It’s only a record breaking drop if you look at points alone, but not percentages.
Example:  1600 pts / 4.6% drop versus Black Monday in 1929, which saw a 38 point / 12.8% drop.
So there is no indication whatsoever that traditional markets or fiat currencies are dead or dying.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:30:06
The stock market saw enormous growth in 2017:  the Dow went up 25%, S&amp;P 500 up 19%, and Nasdaq up 28%.  How on earth does the Dow dropping 4.6% after such growth indicate fiat is over?
What is this bounty of knowledge you have to bestow, What insight do you have that others don’t?  If you were smart you’d be invested in BOTH cryptos and stocks rather than just cryptos.

Yeah, everyone here is sweating $500 crypto holdings and praising many go-nowhere alts, but the Too Big To Fail banks aren’t interested in obscure alt-coins with no history or adoption.  EVERY big player is interested in bitcoin, however.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:43:16
No matter what anybody says, the only currency that matters right now is whatever your government issues.  Bitcoin and any crypto only have value that is tied to some fiat.
Until the day comes, which may never come, in which a cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies actually replace fiat somewhere, none will truly be a currency for anything more than a means of moving fiat (ie $x or £y) from one place to another.
I’m hanging onto my cryptos in hopes that adoption continues to increase and we will actually have a true currency.
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:48:56
Imo credit cards can be extremely useful as they essentially allow you to give yourself loans.  Not sure why it would be considered a racket, however.
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:51:46
Do you know what a credit card is?  It’s not an intermediate stage toward adoption of crypto in any sense.
The only reason I brought up credit cards is that if you consider that the average German is so opposed to something like credit cards, why on earth would they be so willing to switch completely to holding all their money in cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:39:48
9 years versus 2 months I think for something like Nano?  And half this community says to go all in on Nano...
9 years isn’t negligible in technology, and certainly not in the crypto space.

The overall trend was definitely headed downward, but the moment BCH was added there was a flash crash over $1000 down.  That’s more the point I’m getting at.  The chart unfortunately doesn’t show that level of detail.

Think about Linux distributions.  You don’t see Ubuntu masquerading as Debian++ or something, and their developers don’t try to convince people that it is the REAL Debian.  Why should it be ok for Bitcoin Cash proponents to tell the public that Bitcoin Cash is the REAL Bitcoin?  We shouldn’t have something so misleading in such a volatile market where millions of people’s money is involved.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:49:28


Are you fine with Bitcoin dropping as long as it’s worth more than YOU bought in for, or would you be okay with it going to say 50¢ per BTC?  Crypto will only supplant fiat currencies if there is a sufficiently high adoption rate, and dumps like this can hurt adoption.  I don’t personally see how a large price drop is a huge benefit to the average person in this space.
If you want it to drop to “weed out” the persona you deem undesirable, then I don’t think you understand what it will take to supplant fiat currencies and the modern banking system.  Crypto needs more people invested in this for it to work, not fewer.
