Make sure you sign up with bittrex with the exact same spelling on your id...

A strange place for stats...
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:01:19
2 days on cable modem, 50 mbs
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:06:32
Next one is at 11.5
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:16:27
and the stats are useless as far as getting folks excited about helping the network

I've made quite a bit on it, though have watched it be irrational and not matching rises and falls in the BTC price...

I agree, but if you look at the number of people searching for aliens through SETI, looking for a prime number, or curing cancer, though distributed computing, a better user experience for running a node has a lot to offer.

From MN, set up with bittrex, then move coins from coinbase. Same thing happened to me, pm me if you need help, advice... Getting ID set up with bittrex took some time...

Right now the crowd is about the price, it should be about the system.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:54:19
Yes, like death and taxes, but you get to choose a lot more coins.

All of this should be made clearer to the end user, you have actually just made me not care about helping the network.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:14:51
The app should allow me to max out processing power, right now it is only working on 10 connections at a time, I should be able to dial it up or down.

I've tried reading tax manuals, I've done my own taxes, when running a business, having insurance, contractors, income, expenses, it becomes so much easier to hire a CPA and say, "Can you do this?" The rules are crazy hard to figure out.
