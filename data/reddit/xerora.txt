LOL, you're mad AF cuz someone corrected you.

It doesnt calculate the fraction. It literally says **"Calculated for 1 BTC""** at the top.
And For the difficulty i seem to be mining fine, im definitely not getting a fraction of a satoshi. I went from 50,000 satoshi to well over... 56,000 now in less then 10 hours. Across all 3 devices.
Edit: thanks for the heads up on the "100 satoshi =0.00000001 btc" Fixed it in post.

It wont be accurate because the power usage to mine a satoshi is significantly less, and the fact that its a fraction of a decimal of BTC also screws the calculations up. 
Also, while a satoshi translates to a bitcoin **as i stated in my post** btc miners however do not benefit from people who mine satoshi.

I tried this, its calculating for BTC which has a different power consumption to mine than satoshi, this doesnt work.

Now youre just spewing bullshit because you dont want to look like the asshole of this conversation. If no one was going to pay me for clicking a button to start mining, then i wouldnt have gotten paid from nice hash (before the hack) and zpool. 
Now why dont you skip off to another thread because at this point I'm starting to think you're genuinely autistic.

Im not mining BTC directly, thanks anyway.

.0005 btc is $7.00, genius.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:30:56
Yeah thats totally what the problem is. My post already said .0005 BTC which again, is about $7.00. You didnt read it, fucked up, and made your self look like a dumbass.
But yeah. I'm the "dumbass" here.

Before I deleted my post, due to me finding the equation somewhere else, you clearly didn't read it in it's entirety. The developer is running a holiday promo, anyone that rates it 5 stars gets 50,000 Satoshi add to their payout. So I started with 50,000 Satoshi, and mined another 6,000.

A Satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. It is the least amount of the currency recorded on the blockchain. One Satoshi is equal to a hundred millionth of a single Bitcoin, which is 0.00000001 BTC.
Mining satoshi in a pool doesnt yield someone else better profit then myself, from my own miner, because its such a small fraction. 
So lets say you and i were in a pool together. You're mining BTC and I'm mining satoshi. You have 0.00000001 BTC and i have 100 satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) You are waiting on me to update the block chain so you can move up to 0.00000002 BTC, but because I'm mining satoshi, so far, I've only gotten to 0.00000001.5 BTC (half the fraction being 150 satoshi) You're still waiting at 0.00000001 BTC. I now hit 200 satoshi (0.00000002 BTC), and you get the updated block, and now also hit 0.00000002 BTC. Make sense?

If you're going to spit out a random number for the amount of time its going to take, show the equation, or don't exaggerate.
And there is a difference. **The btc calculator doesnt calculate the fraction of the decimal. Only the decimal.**

That's interesting. I never named the "app in question."
