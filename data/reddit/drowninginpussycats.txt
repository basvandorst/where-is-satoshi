That was after running up to almost 1300 last night. Dipped to 925 on Binance this morning, but a pullback was pretty obvious, and it's gone back to 1150.

Can't speak to what's standard but I've bought all my alts on Binance with eth. Easier and faster  to transfer over. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:30:42
Can exchange to eth too.

Btw this should not be pitched as improving women's health, that's a terrible take. It should be pitched as expanding the pool of available contraception, most especially the options available for men. I really hate seeing men minimized on male birth control, which could contribute so much towards bodily autonomy for men.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:21
TO THE MOOOOOOOOON!  18.5k HERE, WHO'S IN FOR 19, 19.5, NOW 20, NOW 20.5, NOW 22!  HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:13
Sold .05 of my .43 total @ 18.7K before it corrected down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:02:00

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:32

Bought in on 11/13 through end of December, about .55 total BTC and $5K USD total after several buys.  Sold $1500 this morning @ 15K, still holding about .42BTC.  Thought about cashing out to fiat entirely, would have just about doubled my money in a month.  Might cash out another .10 or .15, but I'd like to hodl .25 or more long-term. 
This morning is absolutely insane.  I went to bed @ 15200, it's $17500 not even 12 hours later.

I bought 2 shares of GBTC (~.2 BTC) through my 401K near the low this morning when the premium (historically 60-100%) was down to just a bit less than 10%.  So yeah while your point is valid (I had already used my liquid assets) I was able to buy in via another method that had not made sense until this morning.

GDAX DOWN!  
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:15:01
This was obviously not the best advice...
However, what's going on with GBTC now? I got in close to the bottom this morning when the premium was pretty low (~12%, or about $1250).  The price has now swung back up above 1900, but bitcoin has barely recovered, so now the premium is at least 50%. What's the average premium for it over the long run?

12000? I haven't seen it lower than 14, maybe 13.5 on gdax.

The word problematic is problematic.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:12:01
This was...beautiful.  I'm going to cry if it's copypasta.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:30:16
yeah thought it would top 8K, then dropped to 779x.00.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:39:11
Lol, this made my morning.
