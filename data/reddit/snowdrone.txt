These are pretty different options. Sure, if doubling the block size is all SegWit did, it would be dumb to do that in hundreds of lines of code. On the other hand, it sounds pretty impressive that it enables 'for profit third party off chain solutions' in 100's of lines. Why did you include 'for profit' in your critique, is that an issue for you?

Hello gambler! You're following a herd - powered by bots - and they will have already sold before you know what's happening. Consider reducing your risk and selling half before the decision, if you are not a long term holder or otherwise not confident in the future of BTC.

There are a lot of nasty people on this thread. Remember, if you're a software developer, someday this will be you. It's impossible to develop software of consequence without bugs. What you can control is the release process. If this hit production, the failure is the release process, more so than a developer's confusion about how to handle a failure mode in this context.

It's evidence that other coins will emerge, but none have come close to taking the  spot from BTC.

The largest legal tender gold coin ever produced was unveiled in 2012 by the [Perth Mint]( in Western Australia. Known as the "1 Tonne Gold Kangaroo Coin" and with a face value of one million dollars, it contains one metric tonne of 9999 pure gold, and is approximately 80 cm in diameter by 12 cm thick.

A crash, when it happens, has typically been 80% off the high. So, I usually think about the 'crash price' instead of the current price. During the last crash it went from about $1000-&gt;$200. If previous crashes are any guide it might drop to around $1000-ish, followed by a multi-year bear market. But after that (going by prior behavior), could go higher than it is now. Nobody knows what will happen though.

Any good tech company knows not to screw today's users for issues that might happen "decades" from now, especially if the solution is to solve some compute resource constraint. CPU/storage/network costs have steadily decreased year after year for several decades.
