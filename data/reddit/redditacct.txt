Jeff Garzik, one of the Bitcoin developers, explained as much in an interview and concluded that "attempting major illicit transactions with bitcoin, given existing statistical analysis techniques deployed in the field by law enforcement, is pretty damned dumb."[32][33] He also said "We are working with the government to make sure indeed the long arm of the government can reach Bitcoin... the only way bitcoins are gonna be successful is working with regulation and with the government."[34]

If people were truthful, they'd say for the average person, there is no advantage for them to use bitcoin at this point. There is extremely limited utility in terms of places/services for an everage person to use it, hassles of setting up and transferring money in and out of it, etc.       
         
It has not reached a critical mass where the extra hassle of bitcoin would be "evened out" by some advantage for the average person.      
     
bitcoinstore.com is close, but still probably not enough to move someone from Amazon or Target or Costco or Walmart for those items.     
     
And average people will rightly point out the lack of convenience of bitcoin - set up new account at some website they never heard of, move fiat in, do exchange, manage account, send docs because mtgox wants them or dwolla is delaying your transfer and then ok now you have bitcoin - big whoop.     
        
Can I use it at Starbucks or Safeway or 7/11 or the gas station or to pay comcast or Target or the Starbucks _inside_ Target or PG&amp;E for my utility bill or Taco Bell or AT&amp;T for my iPhone or iTunes for my apps or zappos.com or Macy's or Costco for tires and pizza or the movie theater or for my Netflix bill or the American Apparel website or Amazon or betseyjohnson.com?       
       
No? I can't, well then wtf is the point why did I waste time setting up this account and faxing docs to Japan? Why would I use that?  So lame...     
       
That is going to be the reaction from average people; you won't be able to dazzle them with tales of the future and some list of stuff they never do and don't care about - this is similar to telling people that desktop 3D printing is going to change the world  - yeah, maybe, but right now you can create some plastic doodads. Plastic doodads and alpaca socks - average people don't care. They were told flying cars were coming, too, and we know how that has turned out - so they're going to wait and see how things pan out.

That's why the government says that Liberty Dollars got shut down.        
It is like impersonating a cop, if I go to Target and glace at the "security" guy out of the corner of my eye - he looks exactly like a cop, I can't tell the difference. But those people who dress and look just like cops never seem to get prosecuted for impoersonating.  Lots of mints make crap that looks almost exactly like US coins - the difference is those places expect the "collectors' coin" to deadend in the sucker's hand who bought it because it doesn't have value near the original cost. So the government doesn't prosecute those mints for those valueless but very US coin-ish looking designs.         
          
Liberty Dollars is guilty of, at most, a misguided evangelism effort - they were encouraging people to try to use them at local stores in order to get them to participate in accepting Liberty Dollars. They weren't trying to encourage people to pass the stuff off as counterfit US "FRN"s [Edit: Nor were they trying to fool direct buyers into thinking these were real US currency/"legal tender" - I read the crap on their website back then]. From what I saw on their site, the actual bill were beautiful, like old US silver certificates, I don't know how any cashier would mistake them for US currency. Besides, they were worth more than the equiv of US currency, so I don't understand what kind of rational case the government could make that people were trying to commit any kind of fraud.  The whole thing was a set up - they had talked to the government and were told they were in the clear.        
          
And as far as theorizing about the legality of bitcoin, it is certain not going to be legal when the powers that be decide to deal with it (my guess on the reason they have not tried yet is that they don't know how to shut it down [yet] and are instead talking via non-public channels to credi card companies and paypal pressuring them to not allow bitcoin).       
bitcoin can be considered basically a "hawala" and the powers that be decided to crack down hard on hawalas after 911.  They are firmly against any method of moving/using money that is not controlled by their friends and themselves.

Accounting is tied to many laws in the US, financial and legal risks come from sanctions/fines/penalties from some ruling/decision by some part of the US or state governments - that is why accountants/lawyers will say no to bitcoin - not due to direct financial loss of any type.        
      
Currently, the bitcoin community is viewed by the world at large as mostly kooks, drug users/dealers, scammers and other undesirables - this reputation is another layer of deterrent to "normal" businesses from wanting to participate - add that to the unknown legal risk and it is a no-brainer for most businesses - yeah, no.  Hell, even reddit users think bitcoin people are crazy as you can see in threads where bitcoin is brought up/advocated.

Um, unless you've dealt with CARB and the Cali DMV, you should not assume that - with them the default answer is "no" (unless you are rich - I heard of a guy suing the Federal DOT to get his racing Porsche legalized).     
     
CARB considers aftermarket exhausts to be an alteration of the emissions control systems and requires that they receive a CARB number to be sold in California - even differentials somehow magically alter the emissions control systems - CARB controls what they want and makes up the reasons after or "just because".

None of those are why an _average_ person should use bitcoin now. About half of those are "why an average person might be interested in bitcoin in the future".         
       
1 - Not really because you have to factor in that right now because the "average person" is not paid in bitcoin, they must do one more hop at the ends of the tx - fiat -&gt; btc ... btc -&gt; fiat .  Right now that  probably incurs more or same expense as whatever method they are currently using.    
2 - but they still have to have a 'real' bank account, so they don't care.     
3 - They don't do that and they don't care.     
4 - They don't do that and they don't care.    
5 - Not average, but maybe but see    
6 - Average person? The average person spends a few hundred a month at 10-20 places/services, tops.  They are not international business people. See  and      
7 - No, bitcoin is not designed as a micropayment system. There are direct contradictions to this in bitcoin "literature".     
8 - The average person would not do this but they might use something along these lines in the future when/if bitcoin becomes more friction-free  from fiat systems.       
9 - Has the added friction of crossing the fiat/btc boundary, same as  9b is a fantasy currently.     
10 - They don't do that and they don't care. Contracts work fine without bitcoin payment history, so no one will see that as an advantage over other proofs of payment.

PayPal is a bank that doesn't have to follow any banking regulations, so if banks are not stopping paypal from being paypal it is because it is more important for the powers that be to have paypal exist and be the tool for blocking every other form of internet payments - so no one is going to "take paypal to court" and win.

Due to group identity psychology, this will be rejected as a reason but:   
      
not jealousy, not libertarianism, not "fear of the unknown" but because some of the loudest bitcoin advocates are obnoxously zealous and act like anyone who does not embrace and endorse bitcoin is an idiot or worse.   
Edit: The responses in this thread make my point - look at most of the reasons people are posting for "haters" they almost all boil down to "the haters have negative personality or mental traits that make them mistakenly dislike bitcoin [and freedom]". Maybe true, but it will be 1 in a 100 million that get converted to bitcoin after being told they are idiots for not using bitcoin.       
        
The discussion around wikipedia is a good example. Instead of it being accepted as a reasonable business decision to say no to bitcoin, people act as if wikipedia is run by anti-freedom luddites or whatever - outsiders are never going to warm up to that type of elitism (stop being idiots and accept bitcoin at your business/non-profit) and insiders will continue to view outsiders as less intelligent and evolved - whether or not that is true, it is a part of what breeds the "hate". It is like Northerners telling Southerners that they are dumb hillbillies - it makes the Northerners feel superior but it is not going to create converts.      
      
Another thing that makes people exasperated - the "we want it both ways" aspect of bitcoin - people complain when bitcoin is taken off the currency comparison page on wikipedia (because the taker-offers say it is not a real currency) but then when there is a discussion of regulation and legal issues, the same people say "no, bitcoin is just magical mathematical fairies in a distributed ledger system, not a currency".

\ is not a requirement of the bitcoin system, nor is the bad thing you say bitcoin is disrupting a requirement of the current system. Those are both symptoms of the relative position of the two systems.     
      
Visa doesn't "have to" charge 1-3% or more and bitcoin trading/exchanges/merchants don't have to charge less. They currently choose to (charge less), yes but that could/would change as mainstream vendors get into the system.      
       
The disruption is statelessness and backing-lessness and the less than "3% private tax" is a result of those things - anything that is part of the current banking system won't tend to charge less because there is no incentive, it is a monopoly. Any system attempting to challenge the most entrenched system in the history of civilization will have to have incentives, lower fees are one of them, I guess. In that respect, bitcoin is no more disruptive than e-gold or many of the other alternative currencies.      
      
If bitcoin becomes a common payment method there is no reason to believe vendors/merchants won't say, well I have to pay for machines to run bitcoin, hold the full 2TB blockchain and do all my verifications, so I have to charge for bitcoin transactions to pay for that bitcoin specific "stuff" just like I pay for Visa terminals, etc.

hmm, I am not sure how they can do that if the amounts are in the range that some people list - $1000 - $15,000 obviously a large transaction like that is not confirmed several times instantly. And either way, you are skipping over the part where you have to meet and do the exchange - so that part is not "instant".     
     
So it is - arrange a time/place and then go meet a stranger somewhere and trust them or go through the hassle to confirm your docs with some institution, neither is optimal.

I came looking for someone to say ledger.      
I'll expand a bit:      
bitcoin is a ledger system where all transactions are shared via a network to everyone for all accounts. Accounts are protected public key encryption, so people can see your transactions but cannot masquerade as owning a certain account. It is not like things before it, it is a group ledger system that is mathematically verifiable, a system that can create trillions of account numbers, track transactions going in/out of those accounts, create and track "value tokens", etc.         
It is like creating an electronic banking system, digital currency, and e-wallet system all in one.

In theory, they were a good idea but for the first 40 years or so they and their infrastucture were not good and horses were the more practical and economical choice. Many of the disruptions of cars were negative, too - noise, toxic fumes, speeding, etc.

Before you go asking the alligator what it eats, study what happened to e-gold - e-gold wasn't money, right? But they killed that. I don't know how you could possibly expect a positive result from this except if you had no knowledge of those groups, their goals and their motivations.     
       
Just say no btc for your organizations and move on. Money from semi-anonymous poor people and elections don't mix, semi-anonymous money from rich people and shady sources are A-OK via the super PAC laws.

The legal liability comes from there not being a clear, set accounting and reporting "path" for bitcoin transactions.        
        
We can't have a reasonable discussion if people are going to pretend that there is no risk for businesses to go into unknown legal/accounting/business waters and then accuse me of "spewing FUD" because I am pointing out why businesses and nonprofits would be trepidatious about accepting bitcoin.         
          
Accusing me of "spewing FUD" stops the discussion - if there are no legal and accounting risks for US businesses or non-profits to accept bitcoin, then the bitcoin community or the fancy new foundation should _prove it_ then we can point to that proof when we want to ask a business or nonprofit to accept bitcoin.       
        
And some lawyers who are well versed in legal/technology issues have gone on record and they disagree with your assessment of the legal environment in the US for bitcoin:

bitcoin is meant to replace a part of the government, the internet was created by the US government and grew based on certain principles. Now that it has grown into what it is - it should not be handed over to big companies to limit as they see fit.

So then the whole decentralized thing becomes centralized around a central registry? How do we decentralize the registry?     
       
Wait, why not just use the blockchain and say whoever "claims" (via some mechanism) that name of colored coin first on the blockchain gets it and then anyone can "glean" a complete registry mapping by parsing through the blockchain. registry would contain colorID, colorname, starting (btc) block.  And you hook that to a dns server that allows requests like {colorID}.id.coloredregistry.com, {colorname}.name.coloredregistry.com, {blk}.sblk.coloredregistry.com That way colored coin clients would never have to look prior to blk X for transactions for a given color.

This is a difficult issue in terms of money psychology - there is a group that gained huge economic benefit in bitcoin. Why similar groups who gain vast economic benefit through loop-holes, graft or risk taking don't bother people is a vexing question. It is most likely that people are able to put themselves in a "coulda been me" scenario with bitcoin much more easily than with procuring bailout millions or getting govt grants for free, etc. So it bothers them more than the more mentally distant scenarios. That mental block will be hard/impossible for some people to let go of at this point in the lifecycle of bitcoin, later it will be easier for people to gloss over the early adopter issue.       
      
But if bitcoin advocates try to dismiss it completely, that will turn people off - the best angle seems to be comparisons to other early adopter advantaged groups - California gold rush, Venture Capital, etc.

It certainly does apply, just because they say (essentially) we don't want to accept bitcoin because the legal situation around it is unclear and we want to be able to "clean" represent other entities that get in legal trouble over bitcoin doesn't mean that those other entities they might represent are in some different universe where the US legal status of bitcoin is different - you basically said the same thing yourself in a different post. Those comments make it look like you are trolling me:                   
         




          
Seems like you are admitting there is no precedent, just as I and the EFF are saying.       
        
Not unique to EFF:         
        
* We don't fully understand the complex legal issues involved with creating a new currency system. Bitcoin raises untested legal concerns related to securities law, the Stamp Payments Act, tax evasion, consumer protection and money laundering, among others. Are you saying someone else does understand these issues better than the EFF? If so, who? Are you saying these issues only apply to the EFF? It seems clear that they don't.            
     
* Since there is no caselaw on this topic, and the legal implications are still very unclear, we worry that our acceptance of Bitcoins may move us into the possible subject role. This could apply to any US business - they (any given US entity) might want to be aware that their acceptance of Bitcoins may move them into the possible subject role.
* Because the legal territory around exchanging Bitcoins into cash is still uncertain, we are not comfortable spending the many Bitcoins we have accumulated.

Mike Hearn:   


Don't feel too bad about it. Most users are still on Satoshis code which does not implement SPV, so Bitcoin is struggling to scale as the number of transactions ramps up. This means that every so often when somebody creates a service that happens to spike transaction load they get accused of doing "dos attacks". I don't really share that view.

non-profits have to ask themselves - do we have money to pay lawyers to be the legal test case for bitcoin? No? OK, let someone else with more money/lawyers do it.           
          
websites/nonprofits/businesses think: 'But lots of bitcoin supporters want us to do it. In fact, some are _demanding_ we do it because they say it easy and has low transaction fees, etc. But they don't want to pay our legal and accounting teams to fight this battle for the first time in the US, "idk" why not.'         
           
Please stop bitching about why non-profits or for-profits don't want to pay bitcoin's way through the US legal/regulatory system - it makes the bitcoin community appear selfish and in denial about how business and government work. It might be great for bitcoin users and for "bitcoin" and in some small ways for the business or nonprofit, but it creates a huge risk that is not acceptable or reasonable for most US based businesses to take on.         
         
If you want US based business to accept bitcoin, then set up a corporation in the US, do business in bitcoin and somehow force the government to use you to set precedent. Otherwise ask once nicely and accept a "No" with or without any justification behind it.

I said prudent experts would say it is not worth the risk for most businesses due to there not being clear guidelines/laws/regulations about bitcoin. Nonzero risk is the same as your exageration above.         
             


       
Obviously, you know there are not "specific legal concerns" because it is new and touts its disconnection from the current banking and financials systems as one of its features. The EFF's analysis is clear and plain, there is a risk (not just to them, their analysis of the current legal state of bitcoin is not unique to the EFF - that is their opinion of the current conditions for US based entities regarding bitcoin) because it is new and there is no clear case law nor regulations for bitcoin. Similar to PEX in the building industries or new derivatives or new technologies (digital music, cryptography, etc).          
          
Pretending there is no risk is disingenuous. Bitcoin can't have both ways and say we are completely disconnected and/or different from existing banking and financial systems and then say "and we are sure there is no risk to regulated businesses to using this legally untested system".         
          
Again, I don't see any business wanting to foot the legal/legislative bill to drag bitcoin through the US legal/securities system. Is the point to "trick" them into thinking there is no risk by shouting down opinions like mine and the EFF's, so that some poor sucker is finally targetted by the government to be a test case?          
        
Why not just lay out the current state of bitcoin plainly the way the EFF did and let businesses decide based on that. Or phrased differently, what would be your expert advice on the legal status of bitcoin for US businesses?

Maybe, but e-gold was legal until it was not, Liberty Dollars were legal (even had a bigwig lady at the Mint/Treasury say they were ok) until they were not. So for businesses yeah, maybe there is not a high probability of being jailed for participating but the risk/reward for the business vs the the risk/reward for bitcoin users is too asymmetrical for most businesses to take the possibly low probability risk.         
          
The point is until there is a clear regulatory/government "path" for businesses regarding bitcoin, it doesn't make sense to be part of the test group for virtually no benefit - the benefit mostly falls to the users and to "bitcoin" as an entity, the risk falls to the business - why enter that relationship?       
         
For a small set of businesses there might be a substantial portion of customers wanting to use bitcoin - enough to shift the equation, but delis, coffee shops, non-profits, etc I don't see their accountants/CFOs running the numbers and the risk analysis and saying "Yeah, let's do this!"

It is not "merely  an acronym for Fear, Uncertainty, and doubt." And it most definitely _does_ "speak to the motives of the persons who employ or evoke these emotions".      


             
FUD is used to to misrepresent/exagerate true risks. In this case, the EFF is talking about real uncertainty, not trumped up uncertainty - FUD is about trumped up uncertainty.  The EFF is speaking "the truth" because it is true that "bitcoin raises legal issues that have not been settled in the US legal system".         
       
It is not FUD to say there was fear about whether Felix Baumgartner would survive his jump and they were uncertain whether his suit would work - that is not FUD. The EFF's expert legal opinion about the untested state of bitcoin are not FUD, they are fact.

Without meaning to put a damper on your technical work, you should keep in mind a few things:
-- systems that work with money are attacked hard and often, by intelligent skilled people
-- in fact some of the people who attack your system are likely to be both more skilled and more intelligent than you are
-- systems that work with money that fail, fail spectacularly ("What do you mean someone withdrew $8 million last night?")
-- banking websites, Paypal, etc. are all like icebergs - you don't see 9/10ths of the things they've done to prevent spectacular failure
-- spectacular failure is your destiny if you don't work very hard to prevent it
-- spectacular failure may be your destiny even if you do work very hard to prevent it
You should plan accordingly.

16 billion - pffft   Apple could (and imo should) corner the market on btc.       
They could create an "infinite" sized buy order at maybe half of the current market price and just buy up a huge percentage of the currently outstanding btc then spend a few weeks/months of their asic production capacity to make a little mining box that they would use to populate their own data center with. Using that they could then corner the network mining capacity. 30-60 million max, I think...

For small tx volumes, obviously it works but I think the problem is hight tx volumes at super low transaction values and the processing fees, etc - but I can't find what I read that said that - I was surprised at the time because it went counter to the usual laundry list of btc "stuff".

Really, I was around then and clearly remember it being the government and educational institutions that were heavily government funded that did most of the work.        
      


     
That is incorrect. The US government paid for protocol development and for the real internet implementation - DARPA, big US research institutions, Al Gore, etc.
         


     
WTF? The government was involved from day zero, I can't believe people don't know or pretend this was not the case. Net Neutrality was part of the basis that caused the internet to grow exponentially. The concept predates the internet and comes in part from the laws around common carrier status for phone/telegraph/teletype operations.     
 
Remain free? It is not free now, there is no competition. it is dominated by a few big companies already. Most people in the US have effectively no choice in internet providers?        
     
We briefly moved away from that during the bubble when _the government_ created laws that required the sharing of the (again heavily government subsidized) last mile - all kinds of competition sprang up - Sonoma County was being called "Telecom Valley" things were looking up but then the baby bells lobbied enough to squash those laws. That actually happened, it was not some theoretical liberatarian fantasy about how some theoretical free market would work.    It was government is a rare move protecting the value of the right of way that was too cheaply handed over to monopolies.

Western Union was a big beneficiary of tightening of those laws in the Middle East because so much money flows from workers there back to their home countries - India, pk, etc. Of course, they lobbied heavily for those crack downs in the first place, so...        
        
They try to say that about Mexico, too - all the money flowing back to Mexico from the US is "drug money" - most of the transactions (maybe not the quantity) are poor people sending money back to their even more poor families in Mexico.

[edit] I think the value of a bounty based system for finding security defects is of limited value to overall security.      
     


     
This is not a true Scotsman fallacy as you smugly assert via a link, it is white hat vs black hat. The people who "actually" want to hack bitcoin and other software, can and do collude extremely effectively as the known history of system exploitation shows and as stuxnet and flame are state of the art examples of.      
When I say "real hackers" or "actually" I mean people who are interested in profiting from software defects, these are often different people from those who post defects to the software creators or on full-disclosure. I don't mean people who can find software defects.                      
        


         
So you are agreeing with me then?       
      
bitcoin or not, the economics of hacking are the same. The small, easy to find vulnerabilities tend to be disclosed to the site/software owners. Bigger, hard to find/create vulnerabilities tend to be used/sold and not openly disclosed (as soon).

"to institute new Government" I don't think we have to argue about this any more, they were laying the groundwork for 2 things - 1 why they were rejecting the current government and 2 - the fact that they felt they had the right to create their own new government. It is completely about government and not about theoretical rights of "free" people.       
       


   
No, its intent was to detail why they were rejecting the existing government - it is, in large part, a list of complaints, if you read it. The only theoretical part was the idea that Kings and "subjects" maybe are not really a proper and natural institution, which was novel for the time and place.

There do not exist any "Bitcoin competitors" currently nor have there really been in the past. About the closest thing was DMT:      
           
It supposedly had semi-anonymous, encrypted tokens, but used a central (corruptable) bank to clear the tokens.     
         
Any competitor to bitcoin would need to be separate from the credit card system and basically the banking system. Any alternative banking/currency system became (more) de-facto\* illegal after 911 in the US and via various international groups, most of the rest of the world.       
       
Any mobile payment processors are like the 'independent' ISPs that sprung up in the US because of the AT&amp;T break up ruling that required AT&amp;T baby bells to give last mile access to other businesses. Mobile payment processing is just icing riding on the current credit card system and can be put out of business by the banks/credit card companies raising fees or changing fee structures. Why there is some much manufactured excitment in the business press about mobile payment processing is a complete mystery to me - sure a few of these might succeed and then by absorbed and strangled (a la delicious/flickr, etc) by Visa or whoever but most are bs.

So you don't really want to understand the problem but you want to have an opinion that people take seriously - this is the cheerleading thing I am talking about.    
      
Splitting the network means that groups of clients have different, non-compatible versions of the blockchain - that is the "big deal" - to "fix it" after the fact costs someone(s) money and creates havoc in the ecosystem [I am not saying that is a bad thing, but the core developers do and people with btc would]. Then you say just stop and fix it by doing exactly what he said you have to do from the get-go and I pointed out as the reason that the bitcoin "thing" is not _just_ a protocol.      
      


     
I don't know/care if you are more or less "qualified" than the core developers, but don't be an ass and offer glib solutions to problems that the very people who are working on them say are non-trivial without even trying to understand the full complexity of the problems and the currently proposed work arounds/solutions.

It would be like a city having no trash cans and then continuously wondering why there is trash everywhere.

If the "same level of security" means nodes in the network (since 20 million in server hardware computing power will grow over time), it shouldn't be hard to do; for the same reason that businesses run mail servers and POS servers. 
         
It is easier to imagine by taking the bounary case, if we imagine that everyone who mines just for the profit from mining new bitcoins (not tx fees) were to suddenly stop or the last block was mined. At that point, if you are a non-mining business related to bitcoin you'd run one or more servers to protect yourself - like you run your POS or email servers, they are a pure cost, they don't directly generate revenue nor would a bitcoin mining server. They are there to support the functioning of the business.     
     
If mining becomes very unprofitable only businesses using bitcoin and hobbyists who don't care about profit will "mine" and the difficultly will drop.      
       
Businesses would run "mining" servers in proportion to the dollar volume of their own transactions as well as the number of transactions, again for self protection.       
       
If bitcoins are being traded in a way that generates profit somehow for someone, you don't need to worry if people will do transaction verification, they will do it without being paid for that "service" as part of their cost of doing business like the way the businesses now pay the ding for credit card merchant service fees. They might reject spammy transaction amounts, but then that might create a market for middlemen of some kind who consolidate txs in a layer on top of bitcoin, the way some people think microtransactions should be handled anyway.

The problem is that two things are conflated - competing for a block reward and processing transactions. The "cost" that everyone is talking about is a self inflicted cost because people want to compete for block rewards, not because of some inherently high "cost" associated with verifying transactions.  The whole analysis ignores mining rewards.      
       
This is like panicking about the massive costs of the email systems, it is a non-issue.
@_date: 2013-01-16 03:27:32
For those threats, I think even at 100s of millions the cost could be considered worth it for them. So, even at 20-40-200 million the cost of trying to destroy the network is not going to be a factor for them.    
     
For categories of people who want have bitcoin continue to operate, the 51% thing doesn't seem like it would work because the network and the ecosystem would react to the attack by adding power or changing to methods that allow blackballing or other means of mitigating the attack.     
       
So given those two scenarios I would still say:     
          
* If an entity wants to destroy bitcoin they still can because for anyone who could make a credible attempt to pull it off, the difference between 20 and &gt;20 million is not a factor.        
        
* Any entity trying a 51% but not wanting to destroy bitcoin would see counter measures employed that might not involve a cost arms race.

I don't know why you are attacking me, I fully support things MPEx is doing (business-wise) - the fees, the security methodology, etc.     
     
But not is not illogical to say: "If an exchange is not reporting trading, it is not fully functioning as an exchange since the reporting of trades is vital to the decision making process of some traders and a vital piece of "telemetry" that the exchange is functioning correctly"    
    
So please address that issue rather than attacking about some red herrings. I wasn't talking about dDOSing, I understand the "billion gpgs served" thing. Again, you are talking about the failures of other bitcoin businesses - and they should be talked about and you deride them nicely and I enjoy your acid wit but there comes a time to answer the questions about your own failures and now is one of those times. Part of being a good business is facing your failures - attacking people who ask about your failures is so much a Republican tactic.

It doesn't necessarily turn bitcoin into a fiat currency.     
       


       
We could say that about other aspects of bitcoin since it is susceptible to the other vagaries of cash, but everyone runs to defend it when those issues come up. Fractional reserve banking is a "bigger sin" in your eyes but it is not so different from the other problems with currencies/monetary systems/bad people.    
      
Also, people might participate in a fractional reserve banking system for reasons other than greed - people might do it to stimulate the economy, even without the promise of interest; the same way people participate in or other giving processes.  George's little building and loan is a good example. You might have a community that wants others in the community to be able to take on capital projects that benefit the loan taker as well as the loan givers, maybe the existence of that project is more important to some people than a little bit of interest.
@_date: 2013-01-15 08:53:24
What is the difference between more bitcoins for a while and more bitcoins forever? What if the "deflation" was a longer curve, when does it become unacceptable? 5 years? 50 years? 200 years?      
     
Everyone gets hung up on the cap at 21 million but the real benefit is not the cap at X it is the inability to manipulate the rate at which bitcoins are injected into the monetary system without consensus of the participants - 2.5%/year would probably not even cover lost keys so the true money supply would probably still shrink slightly over time.

Unless you are not mining but running transaction processing for your bitcoin business - the two have nothing to do with each other business-wise. Silk road, MtGox and SDice have plenty of incentive to do transaction verification even if it is a pure cost - like a web server. The argument that competitors benefit is moot, bitcoin related businesses would not necessarily have such razor thin margins that the difference between running one or more transaction processing servers or not would break them. bitcoin transaction processing servers are not magically different from other business related servers that are pure costs.

If all transactions occur using real bitcoins then this is moot, people understand that full balances are not spendable in a FRB. There is no reason the system is required to allow non-bitcoin transactions. And further, anyone you give your money to can default, be it a FRB or an individual lendee; in neither case is "new money" created anymore than if you had a deposit on a car and then later the automaker went bankrupt.    
    
Similarly, you can have a FRB based on a fixed supply of gold coins, no new money needs to be created - the gold FRB does not have to allow trading of anything except gold coins.  It seems like you are saying it is a requirement to trade account balances and then talking at length about how bad a thing that is and how inferior it it to real bitcoins.           
        
AFAIK, no one was talking in that other thread about non-bitcoin spending/trading.

That does seem better than static pages - humans in a public group. Seems like that should be sufficient for something like MPEx that has an existing set of users.     
      
I tried to think of some automated ways when someone asked me about designing something like this - the best I came up with was to put it is a series of dns TXT records using DJB's dnscurve system that you control.  Then the layer on top of that having bits of signed website pages, dns data, gpg key data and bitcoin address data all cross referencing each other so that all 3 would need to be altered or overridden in some way to spoof all three - raises the level of work required to spoof the identity of a site and its related gpg and/or bitcoin account to a substantial level.  Also, signing all the website pages was part of the design, so I laughed when I first saw MPEx.

Here is a funny way to think of it:      
         
There is a completely honest and bullet proof set of robots and each of them has a list of all transactions in the history of the economy. Transactions are to/from public keys. Anyone can generate a public key from a secret string.  
         
You can post the public key on a web page or billboard and people can send it btc for years and years and then you can go to one of the robots and using the secret string ask them to move some of those btc to your friends or Verizon or a car dealer or whoever; the robots look at the complete transaction history of the economy and see that, apparently due to your good looks and charm, people have sent your public key many 100s of btc.      
      
That robot you talked to happily relays your transaction to all the other robots and they soon all know that you transacted X amount of btc from your public key to someone's public key. The person you sent your btc to may never access their "account" until years from now (which really bothers some people to the point where they want to try to force people to access their accounts at some point).  If you forget your secret string or lose your backup of the secret key (derived from your secret string), you're as screwed as if you'd buried cash in Yosemite and forgotten where it was - the robots nor the park rangers can help you find it.        
        
You can create as many secret string/public key pairs as you want since there are quadrillions possible.    
That way if you are a high powered lady bank executive who likes to hook on the side for the thrill of it, you can create separate btc public keys for each of your clients [or even a separate one for each encounter with a client] (and a separate one for your bank pay check to be deposited to).

I understand the lifecycle of software and yes, bugs are expected, but due to the poor level of specificity in the specification of the bitcoin protocol and the nature of a permanent block chain that cannot be altered once accepted they may have permanent consequences. That is why they are a big deal - because they are now embedded in the block chain forever, unless we start over or forever have every piece of software include exceptional code to replicate those bugs or change the protocol to say "take on faith blocks 0 through X since they are the output of bugs or too loose specifications that you may not want to replicate in your code in 2015."

What is your point? I gave an example of financial, high volume software that uses a common protocol but many vendors successfully without breakdown due to having many vendors' software participate in the network. People are claiming that having many vendors participate in the bitcoin network will cause it to fail and I agree - I am the one who brought it up in the other post:     
      
but I disagree with what to do about the problems.       
      
There is nothing magically different about bitcoin vs them except two main things:   
1 - a poor/loose protocol spec implemented via the original client not a spec/test suite and        
2 - bugs/quirks from the reference client embedded in the block chain "forever" that have to be dealt with somehow at some point.       
3 - no good "meta" layer currently that could find signs of problems that might cause splits.        
     
So the problems need to be solved to grow bitcoin - and a few people have started addressing them, but I don't think they are as hard as Mike and the Masonic Order of Core Developers think they are nor as easy as thinks they are.

Test suites are great but they don't remove the need for a protocol document. bitcoin has relatively few important aspects that can vary - for instance, if a sha hash is wrong, it is wrong at a sha level not a bitcoin level so that is not a required aspect of the protocol - how the sha hash is represented and transferred across a network is though.

Everyone repeats that but the current truth is that bitcoin a protocol defined by the behavior of a single family of software (the one the OP is talking about) to the point that it depends on the bugs in the santoshi client and its underlying software to prevent a block chain split, as the core developers admit/freak out about here:      
     
     
     
"We are stuck with the bugs found in early Satoshi code.  We must faithfully reproduce these bugs, to avoid splitting the network."      
        
"Ideally, we'd have some form of formal specification, but I don't see that happening anytime soon."      
         
There is no specification of the bitcoin protocol except the whole of the santoshi client code (currently).

By trying to extrapolate using data from a time when the two are happening simultaneously and the bulk of the "cost" that people are pointing to is because many people want to compete for block rewards. I am paying attention. People should be saying "The aggregate cost of all participants chasing the next block reward are $43k/day and transactions are pushed along for free like beachballs at the front of a crowd at WalMart when it opens on Black Friday."     
       
The "cost" of the network has varied up to this point, there is no reason that the cost would need to stay the same in the future, it could go down that doesn't necessarily reduce the safety of the network. If the difficultly fell back to CPU levels after the block reward ends then you'd have more safety for much less cost because many more people could participate. Again people are equating safety with total cost/processing power rather than the number of non-colluding participants in the network.  The number of independent participants is more important for the safety of the ecosystem than the total power.   
      
If there are not people/businesses making a profit from non-mining related bitcoin transactions when the block reward ends, then the network would fall back to hobbyists and true believers like it was in the beginning who would run systems at a "loss" the same way they did then.

And yet the comment you link to is still [mostly] wrong. You talk about inflating the total money supply and then you proceed to talk about fractional reserves as if any fractional reserve violates the limit on the total number of bitcoins.    
As quantumfox64 tried to point out to jcoiner, that is not the case.      
     
As long as everyone does not want all their bitcoins in their own wallet at all times, you can create a bitcoin Fractional Reserve System without creating new bitcoins or meta-bitcoins. I am not sure why it is hard to understand:
Person A gives BFRBS 100 btc     
Person B gives BFRBS 100 btc     
Person C receives a 100 btc loan from BFRBS with interest due of 10 btc (10%)   
Magic: BFRBS is now a Fraction Reserve "Bank" with a 50% reserve. 200 btc on deposit, 100 btc in outstanding loans with 10 btc interest due, 100 btc in reserves. It offers 4% interest on deposits and the difference  of 6% is sweet, sweet profits.   
      
The only limit is that the sum of all bitcoin Fractional Reserve Institutions can't have:    
(Total Loan Future Proceeds [Principle + Interest]) &gt; Total Money Supply        
otherwise there is might not be enough money. So all your banks couldn't have loans + interest totaling more than 21 million btc for the current software system.   
           
As I pointed out, George's Building and Loan was a fractional reserve system but did not create "new money".

Thanks. And I personally don't care about a small outage, what I care about is the appearance of a double standard - if the MPEx related accounts are going to call out other bitcoin businesses they have to be ready for questions about MPEx outages/issues. When explaining an outage, "but they suck more" makes you look like you are trying to dodge the issue; I understand the frustration of having some non-issue blown out of proportion, but MPEx has done alot of talking about other businesses' shortcomings.      
      
If the PR person/persona really is supposed to be doing "PR" then insulting people who understand the issues and say they support MPEx is not the way to win friends - but you guys are flying high right now, so maybe it doesn't matter if potential allies get turned off or not - some rainy day it might matter.     
    
Also, generally this is the opportunity for a PR person to shine and behave in ways that are unlike a typical PR flack. If a competitor came out right now matching BFL generally, how many people would switch just based on Josh's behavior alone?

So then if you are worried about a 51% attack, the ratio of  the total money supply value divided by total cost of the network seems a better measure of safety.     
     
The attack becomes more or less desirable based on that ratio not just the network cost since there is little point in controlling a money supply of say 1 million dollars by purchasing 21 million / 2 worth of hardware.       
      
But as one of the core developers pointed out, the 51% attack is more theoretical than practical - a type of mutually assured destruction. If someone tried to gain 51% and manipulate the market/blockchain, then the resulting split would cause catastrophic loss of value of the overall ecosystem making it a very high risk to benefit ratio move - could you execute the take over and cash out before the collapse or could you structure profitable manipulations of the blockchain without detection, it seems highly unlikely.   
     
You could say that there is a risk of a possibly profitable 51% attack if :     
Total Bitcoin Money Supply Value / Network Cost       
is greater than 0.5 _unless_ the attacker has at their disposal, a new method of hashing that has a lower $/GH cost than existing, publicly available technology then the ration is based on their secret cost per GH not the current average cost.

They don't. I think it is in the FAQ, he has the MPEx public key posted there and I think it is in a key server somewhere but from the FAQ, it seems like people have trouble finding, IIRC. The point in the blog post was that the signing machine doesn't connect directly to the internet/key servers to check for revocations, etc.

You don't need a huge amount of processing power to process transactions compared to what is required to mine.     
      
Some people think a market based method for pricing transaction processing is a bad idea, but I don't think they put forward any alternative ideas.

The same way a trading company picks a FIX engine or decides to write their own - there is no magic formula.

So, you are backpedaling? You still taking about things that are not necessarily part of a FRB.  What do these exchanges have to do with whether or not a FRB can use only real bitcoins only - I presume nothing.       
     
Like I said, in the other thread, no one was talking about intra-institutional trading, currency exchanges, trading "balances"/notes, etc. I am still not sure why you brought it up as if it was relevant.  You might as well say "derivatives are risky" because they are trading "notes" with all the pros/cons of those instruments - they are not required by a FRB system.

Yeah, we know but these ads are for normal people, they don't know that bitcoin is money [that is the joke]      
      
So we can have a diagram:  the bitcoin portion of the transaction is the string between the beads and then the bank/cc/etc portion of the transaction is the big black bead.

I did not mean to say it was the only benefit.     
     
Thanks for you well thought out and articulated comments.

if this is going to be the "News corner" can we relegate posts calling for "love-bombing" websites/stores asking them to accept bitcoin to ?     
     
I am tired of hearing about how wikipedia/EFF are a bunch of idiots/shills/"ancomms"/bankerbuttbuddies because they won't accept bitcoin.
