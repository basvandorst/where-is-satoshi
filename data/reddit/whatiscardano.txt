I think this conversation needs to address the difference between money and value. Value is the size of your pie. Money is how you split up that pie to represent the value.

Bitcoin has a market cap of $120B. That’s a lot, but at the same time it is a tiny tiny tiny percentage of the value in our world. The gold market alone has an estimated value of $7.5T. And that’s simply from demand as a store of value.
Bitcoin has no real adoption. It definitely has a good headstart, but it has little network effects at this point. I can’t pay with BTC anywhere I shop on a regular basis. Until this changes, the market is still up for the taking.

The crypto market is tiny relative to equities, housing, commodities, etc... Cryptos never went mainstream. Only a few % of people invested anything into cryptos and the ones that did were very cautious to not invest too much. Speaking on personal interactions, I don’t know anyone that got fleeced from the crash earlier this year. I know some people that lost money, but it didn’t ruin them financially. They have still continued to buy cryptos through this bear market for the most part. Because of this, I personally don’t think there is that much negative sentiment from people. Yes, people have “heard stories” about people losing money, so they remain skeptical. However, all that goes out the window when their neighbor, Bob, who bought BTC at $18k last year is celebrating in the future and telling everyone how it went back up and he sold at $75k!! That’s all it takes and mainstream will be buying more cryptos than you could ever believe.

You talk like one will go to absolute zero and the other is going to infinity... At the end of the day, they both can have value. If you try to pick the absolute winner, and guess wrong, you could be F’ed... I don’t see a problem with a weighted portfolio of Gold and Bitcoin at this point.

Sure you can. If you know who owns the machine...

This. The US doesn’t need to shut down the internet or censor it—they have “privately owned companies” that will do it on their behalf. As long as the government controls how much a company pays in taxes and what the legal parameters around that company operating are, then there is always a bit of a gray area there.

How did what I said have anything to do with Donald Trump? Take the murder of Jamal Khashoggi for example... Interesting how this was a huge topic of conversation, and then suddenly all of the mainstream US media outlets stop talking about it, and what do you know... We just sold Saudi Arabia $250M worth of weapons and military equipment.
Donald Trump is a distraction. If the public can have their attention diverted to Trump, then they won't care about what's going on in the rest of the world.
