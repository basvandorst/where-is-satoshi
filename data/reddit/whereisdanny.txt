**What is he doing now??**
**Mr Brewster is staying with his Grandmother in the Yorkshire area. You are all correct in saying there was no funeral that he attended, this was just another lie to spin. I wonder do you carry a book that you write everything you say down Danny? You do know that your past does always comes back to bite you. You wanted fame and fortune and now Danny you google your name and arrest warrants and you have fame for all the wrong reasons.** 
**Danny stand up and face what you have done, return the lavish items you bought with company funds. Tell the truth, that your bit coin knowledge is as much as a 5yr old you just went with your ideas at a bull at a gate. Tell the truth that you used the companies money to live. tell the truth the there was NO 6 million euro of your own funds for start up. Tell the truth and have an independent account go over all accounts.** 
**For once in your life be honest, you might actually free yourself of some heavy weight. Just think of your family and the stress that all this is putting them through. think of others for once nit just the selfish sole of yourself.**
This person "source 101" in the past has revealed a lot of information about Danny Brewster on the Bitcointalk forum, information that subsequently proved correct e.g. he/she has cautioned well in advance that Danny was getting ready to run away, that his cars were missing etc.
Now he is revealing interesting information about the "funeral that Danny had to attend" and where he is currently hiding.
Read his posts on bitcointalk since March25th here starting from page 180.
