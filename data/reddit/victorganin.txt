Miners pay by coins.

And then again 10k+, because whales will buy cheap coins and pump it through their exchanges. After that will be a new wave of hype and they will sell it to new believers.
And the world will see a new "holders" who became crypto billionaires.

It's not about price. 15k was for those people, who holding BTC instead of using ETH. Lots of people complaining about high transactions fee when they want to pay for something by BTC, but right now we have ETH, which can use right now. Not just holding like BTC, but using when you buy everything.
And I see how people talking about future but actually they just waiting when BTC will be 1kk USD. But even if it will happen, then what? 1k USD per transaction? Good future, yeah. No, thanks.

I have both also, but how much places accept BTC and how much ETH? I see lots of news about "... now accept BTC" but not about ETH.
Now it looks like BTC is a "gold" and ETH is a "fiat". You can always pay by gold, but why, if it's better to pay by fiat?

So, what are beautiful aspects of BTC? This post is about paying for a taxi in BTC, and you talking about something totally different when someone points that this is irrational paying method.
Would you pay for a taxi in real gold? No? Why? Gold is so beautiful! Why don't you wanna pay in gold?

Oh, poor scammers, what a pity.

So, it means now I can take a USB stick, say to some girl "here is 0.1 BTC" and put it right into her...? *(sound of usb connection)*

Seems like he sold at 8400.

And who is paying the sales tax then, if buyers pay with crypto?

I wonder how bitcoin will go to the moon without spoofing and pumping.
