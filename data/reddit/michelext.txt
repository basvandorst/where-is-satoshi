Good, good, very very good. Now I am smiling a little. It is gonna be a fun ride, if your view holds true. So bitcoin will thrive, and no danger.

How did you make this chart?

Probably a plugin on your browser has! It is probably not Reddit.

What if this cycle is the one which would end up in excessive bleeding? that demands ER. jk
BTC is probably some one's huge money laundering plan, only then it would follow those patterns you are talking about. And if that is not the case, those images only clearly show how worried you secretly are about the price of bitcoin, which my suggestion is to just try and find a different line of business than just sitting behind your screen waiting for the prices to either go up or down, cause the reality is that bitcoin is all about decentralization, freedom, and neutrality of money without any stupid fraudulent and corrupt government centralization. When centralization happens it only allows the central guy, more properly, it provides the central guys the opportunity to get corrupted and cheat. Bitcoin, prevents that, it solves the issue of a corrupt central government. it is the basics, or the father generation of a clear, decentralized internet.
My advice: Stop worrying about the price of bitcoin. it can skyrocket and get to billions of dollars and hit the ground and become like 0.001$ each, but it is the inherent intrinsic value of the idea that matters.

WHAT IF:
Here is a what if, What if in 10 years this would become something like:
If you had bought 16,381,493$ worth of bitcoin 10 years ago now you'd have 0.00053$
If you had bought 1$ worth of BIGxFockSteek (some imaginary new computational technology,no it isn't quantom computers) stock 10 years ago, now you'd have 4,541,560,047,413,744,465,429,254,593,863,451,563$ worth of dollars!!!!
Buy BIGxFockSteek

I am so very sorry but I think that is why it is always suggested by the community to keep your money off the exchange wallets. I myself have about 100$ on an exchange, and although the exchange is still operational and I have access to the funds, I always consider that money as 'not mine' or 'gone'. I just use it for opportunistic trading.
