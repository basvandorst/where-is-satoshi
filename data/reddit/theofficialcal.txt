There are a billion ways to buy bitcoin in India. You can use Zebpay, Koinex and Coinome, alongside a bunch of different exchanges. All of them allow you to withdraw to a paper/hardware wallet as well. What research did you do?
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:45:29
Why does the price of bitcoin on Indian exchanges make any difference to you? You enjoy the same inflated price when you sell. 
You can't daytrade on these exchanges and if you're interested in doing that, make an account on someplace like Binance and transfer your BTC there.
The price difference between international prices and Indian exchanges is not due to taxation. It's because of a lack of supply in the country. Again, it makes no difference for you as long as you buy and sell both within the same country. Even South Korean exchanges have the same marked up price by the way. [They also account for most of the cryptocurrency trading volume in the world](
Lastly, Koinex has a 24h volume of 75 BTC and Zebpay has 10x as much which you can see if you open the app. Again, don't daytrade here. Just buy and sell.
tl;dr We don't need international exchanges.

It's literally an exchange. You will need an account with Unocoin. Any Bitcoin they give you will be an off-chain transaction that will not incur any fees.

How much sat/byte should I set my transaction at considering current market conditions? Electrum is wonky as usual.
I wish to pay as little as possible as long as transaction confirms within a couple days or so. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:28:22
Yes. Don't use their estimation, it's a commonly reported problem. Proceed to use something else to calculate your fee please.

If nicehash, don't use an external wallet. The payouts are very intermittent and threshold is crazy high. Make an account with them, get the internal wallet, then regularly cash out to Coinbase since that option is free. Coinbase reliability &gt; Nicehash considering one is a somewhat proper company and the other, well, just got hacked.
Otherwise, look into miningpoolhub. They offer payouts in a bunch of different coins too. Check and both.

That's because they have some sort of association with Coindesk. Most, if not all, articles from there show up on Yahoo Finance verbatim.

You just need to realise that your $100 is gone.
People who have stuck with bitcoin for a while are basically aware that they might end up losing thousands in the blink of an eye.

I think this will just lead to all of us being even more confined to our existing lives, prejudices and desires. If ads were perfectly tailored, most people would probably go crazy and want everything they saw, just because it aligned with their worldview in some way. To me, having ads that can manipulate my mind is far, far worse than all the generic ass stuff I can just tune out.
Of course, I'm talking about a perfect system and we're years, if not decades away, from such an implementation.

Yes, it's called arbitrage. Bitcoin is selling at a $2000+ dollar premium in some countries too. So if you have dual citizenship with a first world country and one of those, it's easy to profit. But you would have to stay in someplace like India so maybe that's too much for someone from America/UK

You could set up a VPN on your home network or one that you trust. That way, you can access from anywhere but the endpoint will be your home. 
Edit: Requires some technical knowledge and leaving a computer on 24x7 and a static IP from your ISP, which you may or may not already have.

Best place to sell though

The same receiving address can be used as many times as required. Generation of new receiving addresses is a privacy feature so that nobody can keep track of how much you have cumulatively. If you have an older receiving address and don't care about anyone tracking you or whatever, then by all means, continue using it.
You should understand that cryptocurrency wallets have a private key, a public key and (potentially multiple) receiving addresses. And no, none of those can lead someone to another one of those.
As for what they each do:
* A public key can be used to keep track of your wallet from your phone, without actually allowing you to spend any BTC from that device. So you're not jeopardizing your security.
* The private key is basically the wallet itself. If anyone has this, they have your money and can do as they please. Exercise caution and never give anyone this or your 24 word seed.
* Receiving address is what you'll be handing out to people or using on websites to receive payment. Think of this as your email in PayPal: If someone wanted to PayPal $5, they'd need to send it to yourname In Bitcoin, they'd have to send it to 1andreas3batLhQa2FawWjeyjCqyBzypd, for example.

I meant it's the best place to sell as compared to other exchanges in the country. I get paid in crypto so I benefit from accidental arbitrage.

I don't like the practice of banning things either, but the PUBG one was issued at the local level and did not come from the central government directly. The ban also expired soon after (same with TikTok). The Supreme Court was not directly involved in either.

Mining will never cease. It's how new blocks are created. Today's miners receive the block reward and transaction fees. Once all BTC is mined, they will only have transaction fees left to claim.

It's a meme in the community. It originated from a typo.

That spelling is incorrect BTW. You should google the difference. Also, you've made several other spelling/grammatical mistakes, just wanted to point it out. (feat instead of feet)
Everything else is, broadly speaking, correct. If you're interested in the history of bitcoin, Banking on Bitcoin is a good documentary.

Citibank is one of the only three banks in the country that is actively combing through transaction history for traces of crypto-related transactions. The other being Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC.
This post indicates that Citibank did the same to a UK-based individual.
Furthermore, Citi was one of the [first]( to block credit cards from being used for crypto purchases. Not that I'm against this particular move, but it does highlight their attitude towards it.

You do need to have a computing device switched on throughout the day, have enough storage to download the entire blockchain and sufficient bandwidth to handle all the traffic, including the initial large download. Most people don't or can't do some or all of this, but it's worth doing if you're passionate about Bitcoin and want to see it succeed.
A popular alternative is using a VPS instead though.

Hi, I'm from India and stumbled onto this thread through a search. I was wondering if you can help me.
I'm very new to Bitcoin but I've been looking for a fee-exempt way to transfer money from my clients in EU/US to India because PayPal is driving me nuts.
This thread seems to suggest that at one point, the value of Bitcoin was $900 and it was profitable to accept payments in India. From graphs, it appears like the value has strengthened in India over the past month but I was wondering how I would benefit if it went back to 1000ish USD. Should I get them to send me a BTC next time there's a crash? 
I realise that this is called a form of arbitrage but I don't see how sending x amount in USD equals more money at my end. Or how the value of BTC varies from country to country. 
Seems too good to be true to me but I don't know enough. Sorry, I'm just very confused...

Isn't there always an altcoin that you can farm? I'm pretty new to this but I thought mining programs like Nicehash have been around for quite a bit.
