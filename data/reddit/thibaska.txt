I need to sell around 1.65 bitcoins... Gemini would be better than coinbase?
And would it sell fast for the normal price value (now 14.5k for a BTC)?
My doubt about gemini is if i can sell it fast or if i will have to put a much smaller price to sell it in the same day

From POLONIEX:
	"BTC is currently under maintenance or experiencing wallet/network issues. Deposits and withdrawals will remain disabled until a solution is found, which may require an update from the BTC team. Any updates must be tested and audited before enabling."

Report to police, get ALL THE PROVES you can. Scam is a federal crime in most of countries.
If police don't do nothing i would find him, see where he goes and pay someone to beat him up every week.

Poloniex website, just go there. All deposits and withdraws are disabled.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:24:24
didnt you have a stop-loss placed?
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:19:53
difficult because you never know when someone will crash all the market

@_date: 2018-03-08 17:12:44
yeah but it was a too high volume... someone just dropped millions or a huge FUD happened right now... yesterday it was the action on Binance and today?

not beat a lot like going to hospital, like just few punches out of nowhere... but every week/every month.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:37:40
we're here expecting more dip so we can buy cheaper
