You do realize that doesn't answer his question at all?

This is assuming the miners need to maintain their current size. The miners don't need to stay this large in order for bitcoin to work. I think it is quite likely that they will down scale once this bubble pops. They will scale to what ever remains profitable, and fees will go down once transaction throughput increases, whether that be before or after the pop.
Personally I don't think the bubble can pop until transaction throughput increases, but that is just something I've been pondering.

So are you saying $30 dollar transactions are to be the norm? Or rather that cheap transactions are a bad thing. Wasn't one the the advantages of bitcoin over traditional banking system that transaction fee were cheap? If fees are higher using bitcoin, why should I bother using a cryptocurrency?

You don't have to contribute to be a part of a discussion that goes beyond the price.

Can you elaborate on this? And on how cash isn't doing this?

This guy didn't predict Bitcoin. All he is saying is some sort of digital cash will emerge, which people have been talking about since computer networks have existed. You should also keep in mind there were digital cash projects before Bitcoin. Satoshi did not make up that concept.
