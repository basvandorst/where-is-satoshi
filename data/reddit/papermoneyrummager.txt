You forgot the ''Permission denied error'' when you try to send your own coins to your Ledger, and the best Kraken can tell you is that sending coins to a hardware wallet might not be possible, but to try it to a wallet on a desktop or software wallet.  Lol, does this even make sense.  You can't forget the ''This authentication link is invalid or has expired'' when you try to move your coins.  My coins are hackproof, and no hacker can ever steal my stash.  I can't even take my own coins off the exchange.  Thank you Kraken.

I am guessing you are 23 years old (based on your Username).  If you bought $40 you have at current prices 0.0023 bitcoins.  Be happy because if Bitcoin was evenly distributed throughout the world to every person this is how much each person would have 21 Million coins / 7.45 Billion people (increasing by the second).

I am terrified that if I try to authorize a new device (IPad) that my Samsung phone will become deauthorized.  I have read many posts that claim this will happen because with Google Authenticator you can supposedly only have one device at any give time (unless you were smart and added the devices all at the same time when the QR code was issued, which of course I wasn't smart enough to do).  I am not even 100% sure if the 16 digit recovery code (that is how I wrote it) is the recovery seed that Coinbase mentions on their website, the code or seed that you need to enter by Google Authenticator to reinstall the 2FA on another device in case something bad happens to your phone.

Let me ask a serious question.  How will it help the economy if we eventually have tens of thousands of people like bitcointwitter who don't produce anything and who do not contribute to society anymore and don't have to work because they own digital assets that they can't hold in their hands?  I am guessing it won't be a problem, but if everybody gets rich then what is the incentive to continue working?  Just invest and crypto and live the easy life?  This is what scares me about crypto once it hits mainstream (we are still far off from that point).  People are going to pour in after reading posts like this and then the house of cards will come crashing down at the slightest downturn.  I am probably just jealous I didn't buy the bitcoins in 2013 when I had the chance.

I don't see universal income in all countries and this will lead to wars and chaos.  Not every country can afford this (actually only a few countries in Northern Europe and they are being flooded with migrants...part of plan to provide companies with cheap labour, that these countries will never need! because the Industrial Revolution 4.0 is around the corner and will wipe out the need for human labor in ways we can't even begin to imagine). The whole system is in danger of collapsing because the only people making money will be the people who own robots, or who service the robots or program the robots.  Not the only but the vast majority.  With an ever-increasing populace and overpopulation we are headed for doom. Add in limited resources and pollution and we are headed towards the abyss.

Thanks for answering. I know I don't have my private keys or recovery seed from Coinbase. I know that I truly don't ''own the Bitcoin'' there until I send it to my wallet.  I am a noob, but that much of a noob (been in Bitcoin since 2013).  However they issued me a recovery code I am assuming for 2FA in case my phone blows up or gets stolen, but when I go to their website they talk about that you need a recovery seed for your 2FA. Is my recovery 2FA code a recovery 2FA seed?????? It is 16 digits long consisting of numbers and letters.

I didn't do that.  No one told me to do this and that this was so important, I thought Google would give you the option to somehow reinstall in the event of loss of theft (it makes sense now in hindsight that this shouldn't be possible).  Thank God Kraken can verify using other methods, but with Coinbase it sounds like a nightmare to get the photo of theIS just right, ect.  I did write down a 16 digit alphanumerical recovery code with Coinbase.  Is this the same thing. I am too scared to deinstall and reinstall because if it doesn't work then I am screwed because I am in Europe (not the US) and no longer have a valid state issued ID or Driver's license and the crackheads at Coinbase don't accept a Passport (the highest form of identification).

9-11 was most definitely a false flag operation carried out by the US Governmen in order to invade POPPY SEED rich and LITHIUM rich Afghanistan.  This gave them the excuse to falsely accuse Saddam of having Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), which was a blatant lie and if he had any we gave them to him in the 80's when he was fighting the Iranians.  We invaded Iraq for their oil and for the long-term strategy to direct the future in the region and to secure American interests and to make the Senior Administration windfall profits with all of the contracts in Iraq.  Never-ending war against an enemy without any uniform is a great profit machine.  Also add the point that you could clamp down on rights in the US with the Patriot Act and NDAA and basically do anything without a warrant.  The US obviously pulled off 9-11.

You are sure it is 16 digits long for Coinbase?  100% sure??  And are you sure that my 16 digit secret key is the same as secret seed at Coinbase?  I couldn't find anything on the Coinbase website that said they have any other codes but I wrote down ''recovery code'' and maybe I should have written down ''recovery seed'' on a piece of paper.  I am freaking out that this is not the same thing, but now you make me think that it is.  I had logged into Coinbase and they told me that I had to update security settings from 2FA text to 2FA on my phone with an App (like Google Authenticator).  Then they had a screen that prompted me to write down the Recovery Code (Seed??) and I remember comparing it multiple times I think maybe even with the writing under the QR Code.  Please verify that the recovery seed is 16 digits long.  You are 100% sure?

Yes, that blew my mind.  No Internet of cell coverage is necessary.  The Google servers I am guessing are randomly generating these numbers (tokens) and they know what is on your personal screen and when it times out based on the time you initially installed it.   I can install GA on the second device much later and have no problems.  The second install just starts showing the token that is currently being issued, right?  It doesn't have to be on the same day or anything?  I know dumb question, but you are really helping to reassure me.  I have sweaty palms and feet, I am fretting that my Coinbase login will go nuclear.   TMI.

Yes, the Dollar is also tokenized.  You have a total amount of money in circulation and then each Dollar or Cent is a representation of that amount.  Like Bitcoin and Satoshis when you think about it.

Thanks for answering.  I know I don't have my private keys or recovery seed from Coinbase.  I know that I truly don't ''own the Bitcoin'' there until I send it to my wallet.  However they issued me a recovery code I am assuming for 2FA in case my phone blows up or gets stolen, but when I go to their website they talk about that you need a recovery seed for your 2FA.  Is my recovery 2FA code a recovery 2FA seed??????   It is 16 digits long consisting of numbers and letters.

I have 2fa using Google Authenticator on my phone and yes of course it is six digits long (automatically resets after 30 seconds I have TOTP).  The 16 digit code or seed I wrote down I believe would theoretically allow me to add 2fa to another device if I lost this one or it was stolen or damaged.  I am just too afraid to add Google Authenticator to another device with the sixteen digit code I have to test it.  Has anyone who uses coinbase ever added Google Authenticator to a second active device and was using both with no problems.

I believe in Allah / Yahweh / God.  All the same being.  I am not sure.  I think digital money is a precursor to the devil.  I am Catholic, but felt just as home in Egypt and some ways more at home during the calls to prayer.  What a great feeling to stop and thank God the Creator for this life and world.  A life without sin is nearly impossible./So we all do something that is wrong or sinful.  I think we are 2-3 generations at most away from a cashless society.  Banks want this to earn fees from every transaction and no one can be anonymous.  We Christians believe in Revelations ''That no may buyeth or selleth unless he has the number of the Beast, his number is 666''.  Ironically the first Apple computer that was sold was for $666.66.  A coincidence.  It is coming.  I think we believers need to unite and put aside the differences because evil I feel will soon rear its ugly head.  Gold is real.  I can hold it.  No one can inflate its value to 0 and the more printing they do it goes up.  Bitcoin is the digital version of gold that you can't touch and only exists in a network.  Gold is not susceptible to power outages.  Whereas Bitcoin is invisible and be easily transported with little effort.  All just pluses and minuses.

Jokes aside, the bitcoin can be written down on a piece of paper and unless they check every book and every page there is less likely of a chance they will find it then gold being sewn into your coat or hidden in your shoe.

What is your proof that only 700,000 coins are floating around out there to buy.  I am Hodling 80% (never selling, don't care what happens) it can all go poof.  I sold 20% today already at a loss to bring my total investment (risk) down to $2500 (that I invested) originally which I am comfortable losing.  I had gotten up to $3500 and I felt uncomfortable in case the whole house of cards comes tumbling down due to large institutions causing a crash to buy on the cheap and then skyrocket the price, which I think might happen sometime next year.  I feel like once the first ETF or this Bakkt thing gets traction that the price will stabilize and correct.  I can live with $2500 less, but $3500 is just too crazy.  That being said I am not a rich man by any means.

I am not a Bitcoin maximalist.  I see more potential in XLM or SLT.

Do I think BTC can fix its sluggishness (maybe with Lightning), but I see BTC being the granddaddy in this.  I am kind of all over the place, but I am going to keep some exposure in this market.

Oh, there isn't even a single one.  Plus if I had to pay 100 Bitcoin when it was was $3000 ($300,000 for the house),and now I still have to pay 100 Bitcoin to pay off my house I would be screwed because I am dealing with a deflationary currency and that 100 Bitcoin now costs over $600,000 because Bitcoin is worth over $6000.  So, yeah I am glad I have a roof over my head.  I have a little BTC but this is never going to be the go-to currency.

What do you not understand...I am a Hodler of BTC, I got in in 2013 and have been Hodling ever since? If you had to take a loan out for 100 Bitcoin because you didn't have the money, then paying the loan back would be now twice as expensive (1 BTC was $3000 when you took out the loan and now 1 BTC is $6000 per BTC).  I don't think most people will have enough Bitcoin in the future that they will be able to buy houses without loans (whether they be BTC or USD).  There will always be a lender and a debtor.

Um, not if you took the loan out in BTC.  All of you enthusiasts love circle jerking the idea that BTC is the future go-to currency.  Well let's say you took out that 100 BTC loan (equivalent of $300,000).  Well now that BTC loan would cost you over $600,000 to pay back because one BTC is worth more than $6,000, so a deflationary currency in this case would screw your life over and make it twice as expensive to pay back your loan.  Not everyone is going to have an extra 100 BTC laying around to pay off a house with, thus making lending inevitable.

I did this, I told everyone that I sold it to buy my 12,000.CHF security perimeter fence, which I really bought, but not with BTC.  I also told everyone when it was at $19,000 per BTC that I sold, now they all think I am a master trader.  I never sold.  I just hodl.

It would be the first car I would follow to see where they live to plan a home invasion.  Transfer the tokens to my wallet or....you get the picture.

As a retired cop (some refer to me as The General) this person is an idiot.  Might as well hang gold bars from the rear view mirror and tape $100 bills to the inside of the windows.  I hope that the Hodler is always driving this vehicle, because unless you want to lose your family this is a stupid thing to do.

I am talking about all of the GMO crops that are being sprayed with Monsanto products that are killing all of the bees and butterflies.  In Southern Germany, just north of me, the beekeepers are losing over half of their colony year-to-year.  That is my problem with GMO.  I think it should be labeled (not the case in the US of A) so that people can make better decisions with their money.

The US is a lost cause.  No universal healthcare, only 3 or 4 months maternity leave, no standard vacation, GMO crap food, fluoride infused water, crime, and, and, and, glad I got out.
