You're talking about a separate situation. vakeraj is talking about reality, in which there is no possibility, not in a million years, that every single bitcoin hodler will hodl until the end of time. You're talking about a situation, a pipe dream, in which everyone hodled infinitely until the price crashes.
I can tell you right now that everyone hodling is an impossibility, because *I would not hodl* if the price hit a certain threshold. That threshold is different for everyone, but I'm living proof that your pipe dream will never exist, and I'm also living proof that people like me exist.

The circle jerk of "bitcoin good, bank bad" is insane on this sub. Bitcoin of course has its benefits, and in an ideal world we'd get rid of fiat, but... c'mon. People here can't honestly think fiat is going to be wiped out by Bitcoin in the near future, can they?
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:36:48
That's a way to put it, but kind of incorrect. Banks obviously don't come close to the freedom that crypto provides, but the circle jerk of "banks bad, crypto good" is kind of over the top on this sub. Its more of a "because the banks don't wanna fuck up handling our money, they go over the top on security and block suspicious transactions unless you authorize them", and less of "ask us permission to use your money". Its a product of being regulated by government, which is one of the reasons why investing into crypto is better, but its definitely not the bank trying to control you, at least in this case.

You're glossing over Lord-Talon's main point - its volatility.

I've used Wells Fargo for a few years now and have never had an issue buying crypto. This looks like an isolated incident.

Its the same concept as any drug dealer refusing to disclose the location of their money. They can't be physically forced to do so, but the US government is keen on confiscating that and will (almost) always offer lighter sentences in exchange.

When talking about a good store of value, you’re not strictly speaking about assets that only increase in value over long periods of time, you’re talking about all periods of time. Hence why bitcoin is the definition of a bad store of value - that is different however from the concept of a good investment. 
But nowhere in the phrase “good store of value” does it say or define itself as a “good store of value only over long periods of time”.
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:51:02
Volatility is exactly the definition of a bad store of value. Unpredictability in value upon retrieval is not at all what a good store of value is.

You're being toxic for expecting one single minded emotion from millions of people. You're the reason this sub is toxic.
Try maybe realizing that other people have different goals, and desires, and enjoyments. Not everyone is you. You're not the center of the universe.

I understand the crypto community can be fanatics but thinking that people here think this tweet is trying to get Trump to " dethroning US's single largest source of power (world's global dollar), yet alone by a tweet " is actually delusional. Nobody here thinks a single tweet would dethrone the USD.

My point was that it was hilarious (and ridiculous) to see climate awareness advice on a bitcoin sub for imagined riches

The point of crypto is that it can be anonymous, if you want. Trade directly through others willing to sell via cash payments sent to your wallet. Riskier that way though, as its much more difficult to find escrow to help you out that way.

It’s asinine to think hashrate won’t drop. Bitcoin is already not financially viable to mine at a certain point. What happens when that’s the case for anybody? Eventually, block rewards will drop to numbers too low to justify mining for most, and the only ones mining at that point will be those willing to take a financial hit - the rich, and the believers.

Because whale oil isn't locked from casual interest and doesn't require knowledge on how the whale oil works before you obtain some. Whale oil is also drastically more widespread and can be used anywhere, whereas lightbulbs only work on certain outlets in stores.
Comparing lightbulbs and whale oil is a ridiculous comparison. Its more like comparing lightbulbs to smart, energy saver bulbs. It can still be used by anyone, but smart bulbs require setup, and the customer has to care about that in order to consistently buy it. The customer also can preach as much as they want about how amazing these lightbulbs are, but the fact of the matter is that most buildings won't be compatible with smart bulbs, and most people just don't care enough to listen to a schpeal on how your bulbs are saving the environment when compared to other, non smart energy saving bulbs.
In other words, and without using convoluted comparisons, fiat is just easier, requires much less work, and is accepted in so many more places when compared to bitcoin.

Absolutely, unequivocally, without a doubt false. I'll do it if no one else steps up to the plate. There's serious money to be made in bitcoin banking assuming bitcoin becomes mainstream.
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:35:18
[you’re a dumb bitch]( 
It literally explains how gold is done in a fractional reserve system. It works exactly, almost word for word, how the previous guy you think you’re so smarter than described it as. 
If bitcoin becomes mainstream, are you really so asinine as to assume there wouldn’t be bitcoin banks? Hell, if no one makes one I will. Mainstream doesn’t mean the majority of bitcoin holders will use bitcoin as a “be your own bank” currency. You’re actually retarded if you think that. Mainstream means most people using bitcoin as a *currency*, and that means banks.

Not true at all, depends on when I buy back in. If I sold at 20k last boom and bought at 10k, even though we’re at 7.5 right now, I still would have made ~$6.5k. If I buy and sell during the booms, even if I buy back in later as it’s at the peak and steadily rising, more than likely I’ll still have made a net positive (assuming it doesn’t level out this boom).

I’m not seeing anything that you’re saying here that means bitcoin is any less than it already is. The fact that bitcoin miners have no idea what they’re doing is awesome! Currency shouldn’t be limited to corporations with the money and structure to keep their wires ordered. That goes against everything bitcoin stands for.

In the next 6 months? I'm not bullish at all - the price is gonna have to consolidate a few more times before the halvening.
After the halvening, in the next year? I'm bullish as fuck for obvious reasons.
I'm buying now, I bought a ton at 6.8k a few days ago to HODL for the halvening. I'll sell at somewhere between 30-80k, depending on how the momentum carries, and then chill until it consolidates again a month or two after the halvening.

It sounds to me like you're implying bitcoin is bad in that way, because it allows the rich to continue doing what they've been doing for years. If so, you're wrong, obviously, but I imagine I'm just misconstruing what you're saying here.

As long as fiat:btc ratio keeps rising that's fine, and that'll keep Bitcoin worth it to mine. But Bitcoin *will* level out, and when that happens, depending on the block rewards and value ratio, mining won't be financially viable at *any* scale.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:27:50
I'll make that trade

Because not all people are investing in Bitcoin because its decentralized, a lot of people are investing in Bitcoin because they see money to be made, and its much easier to do that on trading sites that provide minimal or no trading fees than to set everything else up yourself.

SFYL, not to be an asshole but giving it back would cost them something, especially since there's probably no legal recourse for you. Playing the devils advocate here, all they see is someone complaining about a deposit they see nothing wrong with, and they don't feel the need to hand out a full bitcoin to someone they know won't/can't do anything about.
