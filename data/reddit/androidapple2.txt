Hey guys, Im also 31, (born Sept 1986) and my last day of work is 28 Dec. I dont have enough to retire, but I have enough to survive at my current spending level for a about 5 years (at todays BTC value).
I have entered and been accepted to a very good MBA school and will be using the knowledge gained there to get into the Crypto/Electric vehicle economy.
Exciting days ahead!

Why? If my salary gets paid in bitcoin and I have to pay my bills in bitcoin then I can hodl the rest as an investment.

First dont put everything in one wallet. Divide into 2-5 parts, 2 parts if its say less than 10% of your net worth. Up to 5 parts increasing from there.
I would keep 1 wallet for transacting close to me or in my house and keep the phrase in a well encrypted password database on multiple online storage services (google drive + one more)
Distribute the other 4 wallets to 3 secure locations each. Preferably different locations and different combinations at each location. So in the most extreme case for hundreds of millions I would have my wallets in different combinations on 6 diggerent locations on flashdrives, under encryption that I have a airgapped PC to extract the phrase from.
I would also encrypt 3/5 wallets with remembered passwords and leave 2/5 unencrypted but airgapped and hidden really well or given to a trusted person.
Trying to cover all scenarious is difficult but as long as you diversify then at worst you might lose 3/5 of your investment.
I am trying to cover:
* Hacking of connected devices
* House burning down
* Getting brain damage and not remembering passwords
* Just forgetting passwords
* Kidnap and torture
* Natural disaster in your area burning both your and yr friends/parents houses down
* A person discovering your hiding place at a remote location
* Your death so your family has something after and your btc doesnt dissappear into the void.

Good comparison, I just think your scale on bitcoin is way too small. The part were looking at is the initial upturn, were still getting to the disruptive part.

Exactly this.
Based on past experience 10x growth per annum is possible.
Losing that $10k is not going to change your life significantly in the next 20 years. Investing $10k in BTC now could be potentially life changing.
Which side of the fence do you want to be on?

From a purely financial point of view and assuming that you put some form of stop loss in place there is no reason to not continue to hodl bitcoin. Leaving the capital locked up in a house will earn you only the inflation on the housing market. Looking at bitcoin returns to date you will do much better with bitcoin in the long run.

How about just adding a stop loss to your current portfolio of btc. And jus withdrawing what you need for rent? I would bet that the return you will get from bitcoin wil be far better than inflation of the housing market in the next 5 years.

So lets say bitcoin continues to grow at the 10% per month compounded rate that it has done over the last 3 years.
This means that he will be making a profit of 50k USD per month. For 5k USD/month you can buy a 500k USD house with ease and pay it off in 20 years.
So are you really telling him he should be throwing 45k USD/month in the water for securities' sake? 45k compounded monthly at 10% interest for who knows how long?

Fuuu imagine 10k

Yes
