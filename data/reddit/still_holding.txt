Bitcoin is not going to increase in value forever. Eventually, in a few years, Bitcoin will have found its niche and the price will be more stable, and people will stop hoarding.

That's awesome! I want to take a photo like that in my town.

I love it. You should definitely get that framed. I think I'm going to steal your idea.

Just because it is deflationary does not mean its value will increase forever. For example, gold. At some point, when Bitcoin has finished soaring by 1000% per year, I will cash out and invest my profits into something else, like property. A lot of other people will do the same. I think that will take a few more years. And then I will change my username :)

Chill out. It's probably just internal re-distribution of funds.

Bitcoin is gaining huge momentum in South America. The more it spreads throughout the world, the less chance it can be stopped. Every day it looks more likely that Bitcoin is destined for the kind of success the true visionaries had from the beginning.

I recommend electrum. It's a great lightweight client and very simple to use. I would not recommend running a full-node such as the QT client for beginners.

You'll find better info at an adult webmaster forum, such as gfy.com

No problem sending to Bitstamp from my NatWest account. I have send thousands at a time, many times over the past year.

I have never had problems making SEPA transfers from NatWest into Bitstamp. If I pay the urgent transfer fee (£30) the funds arrive the same day, otherwise the standard fee (£10) takes 3 days.

I have already experienced how great Bitcoin is for travelling. You can arrange a localbitcoins sale in advance for when you arrive in your destination country. Many buyers will even meet you at the airport. Sell some BTC and you get local currency with zero foreign exchange fees.

I can't access it either.

Just because they have a lot of money to fund development does not mean they will succeed. Being overpaid is actually detrimental to performance. I hope they succeed because the concepts are truly revolutionary. But also what they are trying to do is quite complex, in my opinion.

As long as you back up your private keys I don't see any problem holdling large amounts in a wallet, even a lightweight wallet like electrum. Just choose a good passphrase and don't forget it.
Edit: The only downside though is everyone can see how loaded you are.

I think it's DDOS protection.
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:00:47
That's really cool. I'm not sure if storing a private key on the back is such a good idea though.

Thanks for this. Scammers are the scum of the earth and I hope they all die an agonizing death.

Sorry to hear this. I am not sure if I ever want to have a serious relationship because I don't want to experience such a loss. I hope you and your daughter are able to enjoy the holidays.
I read a comment that moved me recently, that went something like this: After you have experienced some real pain in life, losing money doesn't matter much.

I am not a spiritual person, but the book "The Power of Now" has helped me to get through some hard times, and I'm sure it will help me again. That's the only advice I can offer you. Good luck.
