Wait, are you the person I was reading about who had the world's largest cat and the cat with the longest tail? And you were offering a reward for finding your coins?
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:54:58
I almost did the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:47:23
Ah yes cats. My bad. Sorry to hear about the news. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 02:42:20
@_date: 2015-12-12 03:44:59
I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though...

Let the hate flow through you - emperor  (the fed)
@_date: 2017-02-03 23:33:01
That was hard to watch
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:01:43
What a crock
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:26:06
Woah. That's really cool. TIL

I gained more in Bitcoin in one week than 2 weeks at my job :/
Edit: gained more in 1 day than in 2 weeks of work
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:59:01
Never thought of it like that
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:56:00
You made out twice bro? Wow good for you. That's amazing. I thought that only happened in fairy tales.
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:24:10
Dude I'm so sorry to hear that. Please let us know if it gets resolved
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:56:50
Not that it's a bad thing
@_date: 2016-02-21 12:50:54
That's quite impressive actually
@_date: 2016-02-21 12:55:46
You're probably right and that time has passed but I can always dream
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:50:10
I'll be honest it's hard for me to keep all the serious stuff straight. I'm in it to use it
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:56:28
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:50:28
Yup working on number two now!
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:57:07
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:57:00
Makes me want more
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:57:17
Thank you!!
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:51:19
Ahhh I see what you did there!
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:56:12
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:48:04
Shut the fuck up Donnie
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:41:48
Dudes a joke. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:31:02
Forget what any haters say. People on this sub claim Bitcoin is "life changing." You are a prime example of how life changing it can be. Your kids lives are completely different now. Hats off to you.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:50:34
Mining fees are one of the fundamental principals to Bitcoin. Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:38:44
Hey I'm having the same problem right now as well. I've never had to really wait like this to be honest. I think it is ok though.
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:25:07
I chose the immediate shipping option. I hope I get it before the 1st
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:42:51
Yup I just discovered that subreddit
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:36:13
You are able to know what the fee is though?
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:41:13
I just ordered a trezor this morning. How long does it take to reach the US?
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:24:18
Crap. Didn't think of that.
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:58:28
Very cool. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:14:40
I sent him an email criticizing what he wrote. The reason why America is misinformed is because, at least partially, to journalists like this guy. What a disgrace.
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:32:48
Can you give me a quick run down of lawnmower. I just came across it but felt uneasy downloading it.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:38:12
What about breadwallet?
