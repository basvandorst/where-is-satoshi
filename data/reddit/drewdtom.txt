Looks like the feds can now spend the silk road coins on something they want rather then sell them off, look out, more peacekeepers coming!

Oversimplified yes, but good for people who dont understand what you and I do about the FED.

The problem was fix yes, but the hacker still has all the email addresses for the effected users. This was just his second attempt to steal funds. I too got the same email today but know not to trust emails from coinbase anymore.
2 factor auth would stop someone from getting in to your account if they get your password and its very likely the thief would go to other wallets you might use and try the same password.

The rumor on the forum is that they might sell the code but not the domain name and user base. They are trying to do right by everyone and give back every last satoshi to its owners.

not obscure, he wants the same thing you want "honest money" he has just not seen the light yet... I care deeply and think his product will bring more people to want honest money too.

I'm excited by his silver and gold trade cards like the ones DontTreadOnMeme.com makes and that ShireSilver.com makes but it look like he has a loog way to go before he jumps in to the bitcoin thing.... give it time.

woot! I down in Tucson, but if a bar or restaurant starts taking bitcoin, I'll come up and get some food and drink.

Coinbase is not Bitcoin, their for... Bitcoin User Not Effected.
@_date: 2013-10-16 22:11:48
OMG did bitcoin just go from boys to men?
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:53:19
I had the exact same thing happen to me, BitMit got back to my email and did send me the funds back, so you should contact them. Also I was pleased that Coinbase did get back to me to help me to understand the problem. If you create a new address rather then just grab one from the list this should not cause the same problem. I think..
