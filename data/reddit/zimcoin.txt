Its not a one to one swap... seller offer as much as 10 for 5, 9 for 6, etc.

no you can't cancel.  You have 10 minutes after the trade. After that you own it.  Your bank won't cancel it either.  NO, Coinbase won't honor a "new price".  You have to wait for the coin.  That's the gig.

Great research.  Please forward to japanese Yakuza along with BTC donation and addresses of persons of interest.

So, even if coins could be traced to SilkRoad, would the only way to "brush the trail" on that is to sell 2 for 1?  Can't people just do that themselves by setting up a different wallet, then cashing out the $$? 
Also Bitcoin Classifieds has people willing to sell BTC for much less than market, maybe for the same reason?

Bitwash.cu.cc.  I met a guy on Bitcoin classifieds that referred me to that site.  A Bitcoin exchange, wherein you can trade (less) coin for (more) coin to those who want to erase their trail.  I checked out the site, seemed legit.  Sent them 20 BTC.  Was supposed to get 41 back.  Never happened.  Now the site doesn't even resolve.  Also bought Bitcoin for paypal on Bitcoin classifieds and never got them.  Just a warning to any/everyone else in this community.  Both are shams /scams.  Beware of all "washing" sites and even Bitcoin sellers that offer BTC for Paypal.  Bitcoins purchases are NOT covered under buyer protection.

IF this is a real document, and it looks to be, we're all screwed for a while.  Hurricane/tornado... wreckage... long clean-up and rebuilding.  I hope it's a hoax.

I hear ya, but part of the appeal inherent IN bitcoin is anonymity.

Makes sense.  Weird that other people haven't heard of BitWash or Bitcoin Classifieds.  If people can't put there faith in a old large exchange, like Gox, then how can anyone trust any online venue?

Yikes. You really think so.  Coinbase is the most highly funded Bitcoin VC.  I think they have the best Rep right now.  God, I hope they don't have problemos.

Good explanation
