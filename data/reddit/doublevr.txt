Any details on that?
We used it as merchant tool. Worked very bad, I wouldn't recommend that anyone. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:03:51
any details on that?
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:30:30
can't be more truth
@_date: 2016-06-10 09:14:25
seems to happen on a regular basis. how would we call it?
@_date: 2016-06-19 09:51:22
Actuall there's plenty of [VR porn for Bitcoins](
@_date: 2018-10-20 05:32:02
Do they have VR in good quality there?
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:04:11
Just wait till ios apps take btc microtransactions in game 
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:27:18
yeah, i'd rather say people use BTC for something it's not right to buy with fiat. I don't see anyone rather spend bitcoins over fiat for regular goods
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:33:02
IT'S A SITE ACCEPTING BITCOINS
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:01:01
We get "Submit" if we send customers to Bitpay, but they never pay. They see the price before proceeding to payment processor
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:01:46
The payments are made in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and crypto sales are around 3-4% of total sales. We sell VR porn. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 08:35:29
They have a good credit for updating on a regular basis. They promised 1 update/week and they deliver it. The site is run by NaughtyAmerica guys
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:22:41
So out of 4 link you have included a link to this exact topic and another topic where I don't mention the site at all in OP
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:15:33
Congrats! Must be  right?. 
Make sure to check dedicated Oculus Go app packed with porn
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:22:32
VR is that good you virtually want to pay for it
@_date: 2016-06-05 11:29:56
Am I the only one hung up on a CS:GO skin selling for $1200???
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:02:00
That is correct how it works. Though we get much lower submit/success rate with credit cards and paypal
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:03:42
Just like always Russia has a full spectrum of option: from prohibiting and criminalising to leading. Such a tool
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:47:14
Masturbation as Stress-Relief LOL
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:21:03
People were complaining all the time that there's no option to buy porn with bitcoins. We are one of the biggest VR porn site with hundreds of sales daily. Recently implemented BTC and guess what - no one is buying. Got some few transactions so far
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:02:50
Do you have some actual data or it's just a speculation. I don't see people paying anything with bitcoin, while running VR porn site with hundreds of sales per day
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:05:35
The notion is pretty much straight forward. Not sure about it happening any time soon
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:33:03
Right, it definitively has its benefits if you tend to enjoy things rather than just doing it because you have to
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:22:01
it's in the title :)
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:30:43
It's great and it's rocking
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:41:20
The system we are in is built to generate assets, not seat on savings for 50 years. And that's right. 
So far bitcoin has proved itself to be a great investment. Another 10 years are required to see how it works as savings tool
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:07:33
It took us a few days. Basically it was putting some other tasks lower in priority. We wanted to test it since we've got significant increase in sales after implementing PayPal. It's good to have it as an option, but I believe it's not that beneficial from commercial perspective. 
At least it allows me to create a topic like this :)
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:07:23
Not sure I understood your question. We use BitPay to process Bitcoins
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:09:30
Important part about VR is that it's not convenient to download 5Gb, play it with video player, come up with settings, manage a library of 20x5Gb files. 
We have dedicated native VR application with all 3,000 videos being in cloud available in 1 click. That's a killer
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:53:33
Once done right it's mindblowing. GearVR or Rift is min option. Cardboard is not a good thing
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:02:24
I believe there're some few of those no one is actually using
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:51:15
yes, already did. things got back to normal. looks like some users who paid never got our vids. shitty move
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:23:37
we got out of quota
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:31:06
I double checked and find no such email from you (checked spam as well). Usually I see Bitpay emails on other matters. Please check your support system for request from us on current issue.
Also we have contacted support 3 times over the last 3 weeks on refunds issue and got no reply so far. Here we go:


I tried to use that instruction:
But after the step where I need to enter the refund amount I get an error message:
"Refund amount below dust amount."
What does it mean or what is wrong? Can you, please, help me with that?
Thank you.
I'm really not happy with your service. Too bad there's no good option to switch
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:28:13
30 per month
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:48:03
ChaturbateFreeCams is whitelable of Chaturbate site running the same database. Just compare source codes of 2 sites
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:37:19
I have been asking one person in the company 1.5y ago and s/he told me there're no plans to get BTC back in near future
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:04:58
Also makes sense
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:47:14
Probably not
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:03:50
It's official chaturbate website
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:02:39
It's exactly the actual website. the same everything
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:46:49
ChaturbateFreeCams is exactly the same site as Chaturbate. Just compare source codes of 2 sites
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:03:52
I believe the users made it happened
@_date: 2016-09-16 09:58:00
Quite a few now according to 
@_date: 2016-09-16 16:19:03
I thought everyone knows porn guys never graduate...
@_date: 2016-09-17 10:24:52
There's a list of bitcoins cams at 
There were some few reddit threads like 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:51:11
I take two of that for the promo
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:04:53
Someone has to do the hard work :)
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:00:34
What's that?
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:28:13
Thx. Checking into it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:58:59
Most of transactions are PPV. There're some very few subscriptions. Those aren't purchased with bitcoins at all. though there's such an option. Anyway, it's a big surprise to us people keep buying PPV even after we introduced subs, which are way more economically beneficial (for $25 bucks you get access to a hundred of videos and updates in coming 30 days of that particular studio, while with PPV you pay $6-7 and up to $20 per video and get only that exact video)
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:03:33
What do you mean by fees? Currently we pay 14% in adult to credit card processors. That's a robbery, but it has been that way forever. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:02:50
Really? They might seem a bit distorted on non-vr displays. Check their actual photos at 
Still ugly ;) I don't think so
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:56:16
Wow. Didn't realise that. Sounds creepy. Thx for letting me know. Will investigate further into it.
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:38:35
Thank you. Getting it enabled
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:01:01
What's that?
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:24:07
Subscriptions has been a basic business model for conventional porn since the very beginning. 99% of all premium porn videos are being sold as subscriptions. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:14:32
Right. Another thing is that it's only 2-3% in number of sales, around 1% in amount and exchange rate keeps growing like crazy 
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:42:30
That's great. We plan to provide detailed report with data on the coins used for payments. Actually today we got almost 2.4% in transactions and 3.5% in money. 
Edited. Wrong denominator in calculations. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:43:17
You might be right on that. Comparing Coingate to our not-positive experience with previous payment provider BitPay. Bitcoin is our secondary, but very perspective and interesting priority. Checking things out with Coingate.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:30:00
You can watch things from actor's perspective. Female POV is very popular. Also gay, shemale. FFM or FFFM is cool stuff as well.
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:19:45
Great idea. Working on that.
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:25:13
Thx for suggestion. Made it on
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:25:42
It's on now. ty
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:03:49
I'd wish more people would use it
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:31:45
We can also see prevailing $5-12 pay per video micro payments along with $100-300 balance top up. Can't really justify micro payments considering fees and delays, just stating the fact.
[2017 VR porn market research]( suggests 1.2% bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:25:25
Activated. Ty
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:27:03
We use bitpay and keep the money in bitcoins so far. It's a few hundreds bucks per day in bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:01:29
BitPay. Works smooth and past payments. Really happy with it
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:17:48
Thx. Any implications or cliffnotes would be highly appreciated.
@_date: 2019-05-09 11:33:50
Well, there should be some better proof than that
@_date: 2016-07-14 10:13:40
You still have to get VR headset first. Simple $20 cardboard will work with your smartphone, but it's barely good intro into VR. Get GearVR or Rift/Vive to have it rocking
@_date: 2016-07-15 03:58:45
You won't really enjoy it compared to other options
@_date: 2016-07-14 10:13:54
those things are different
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:49:20
Rate of and trade
@_date: 2016-07-14 09:51:32
$600 GearVR + Galaxy S7 is a great alternative to watch movies and play mobile games. Rift and Vive are top notch though
@_date: 2016-07-14 10:14:39
It's for bitcoins, innovation and science. Totally worth it LOL
@_date: 2016-07-19 14:34:03
Great velocity for BTC lately!
@_date: 2016-07-15 03:58:05
to get $700 headset working you have to have you PC seriously upgraded. new build costs cca $1200-$1500
@_date: 2016-07-14 09:52:11
It's absolutely remarkable. Real feel of presence. That's why there's so much buzz around it
@_date: 2016-07-15 04:04:12
They just added it and probably still testing - that's how it was announced. I see it though

@_date: 2016-07-15 03:59:10
Vive is superior in many aspects
@_date: 2016-07-15 03:56:09
What does it mean? Someone from 90s :)
@_date: 2016-07-15 04:05:34
there's indeed little porn made those days because thieving Pornhub business model is killing it, but VR is doing great. they can't steal it and then stream for free. yet
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:46:02
Yes they do. I have the stats - it sells well and bitcoin sales are of decent share
