Google is already involved in a crypto-currency and its called RIPPLE. The bigger Google gets the dumber they get. Kind of reminds me of Microsoft.

and why the hell no link to the website?
@_date: 2014-01-28 09:47:27
You are a smart man to sell my friend..things are not looking good especially after the end of this week. With people getting caught doing illegal things and countries banning the exchanges. 
The Future looks bleak. I don't think we will ever see a high of $1200 a coin for a very long time. Unless some genius comes along and does something extraordinary with the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-01-25 08:27:19
Just the fact that tigerdirect accepted bitcoins first is the reason why i wont buy anything from new egg again or even amazon for that matter!
@_date: 2014-01-28 09:31:25
Their's three things you need in order to live. Food, Clothing and Shelter. Can you pay your groceries with bitcoins? No. Can you buy your favorite shoes and clothing with bitcoins? No. Can you pay your house, condo, or apartment in bitcoins? No. Can you pay your bills in Bitcoins? No.
The real adopters here of bitcoins are not the people but of ALL the businesses/corporations willing to accept them as a FORM of payment.
 
What the bitcoin community is lacking is good marketing. Groups of people all around the world willing to walk into every business and corporation and convince them to accept bitcoins. It's very possible but is the community willing to do this all? and do it all for FREE.
Where is the leadership? Where are the events to get this going?
@_date: 2014-01-27 09:54:49
I can agree with this. Most newcomers think that they have to buy 1 bitcoin to get started. Scares them away. The marketing campaign has been horrible for this coin. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:09:43
Ok, so bitcoins value is much similar to how the stock market works? 
So value from a bitcoin since its focused on currency will come in the form of how many merchants will accept it?
Lets assume Apple and Google decided to take bitcoin as payment in there apps store. Price would go up? Ebay, facebook , amazon, alibaba decided to take payments in bitcoin? Price would go up?
If every financial institution in the world accepted bitcoin ..price would go up ?
@_date: 2014-02-15 08:28:35
You amaze me!
@_date: 2014-02-02 09:10:58
You might be correct, friend. There is absolutey NO WHERE new money can go safely but into bitcoin. The FED knows this. I am pretty sure the FEDS and the global derivative market will have to dump all their trillions of dollars into Bitcoin, soon. The crash/panic of 2008 will look like a picnic compared to crash coming next if they dont. 
 I predict that the end of this year 1 bitcoin will be worth $80,000 USD a piece. I'll beat your prediction and say it will be 31 million dollars to 1 BTC in 4-5 years.

LOL, report this person? Do you even know what Bitcoin is? I have one word for you its called "decentralized." Do your homework on how bitcoin works before even buying/getting involved again.
Bitcoin is a wonderful technology and it has the possiblity of changing the world for the better in the near future. 
Dont hate on this revolutionary technology because you do not know much about it. There is A LOT of information you must learn before even getting involved, right now. Hope you learned your mistake and its time to move on.

Someone go call GOOGLE and tell them to create their own exchange. Problem solved!

I feel sorry for BITCOIN right now. BITCOIN reminds me of Jesus Christ being beaten and tortured. All the other ALT-coins are Jesus Christ disciples. Ripple, Peercoin, Dogecoin etc. Watching the horror take place.

Great comparison to earthquakes but i think your being a bit too conservative here. If my predictions are correct, bitcoin will build up into an catastrophic volcanic eruption that will send the earth into an ice age for a million years.

lol, bunch of "NON-SENSE!" If google really supported Bitcoin they would not tell a low life like you through a private email..lol. They would do press conferences about it to give it the most exposure.
Since that has NOT happened yet google has not inversted ONE dime into bitcoi, period! keep dreaming buddy!

I agree with Colbert and i think bitcoin is worth 800 trillion dollars, marketcap. Will the online world agree with me?

What is with this doge like behavior? Once a doge always a doge!!
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:51:55
The reason why doge is becoming successfull is because it is "trendy, viral, and cheap to mine/buy in." The name hasnt been tainted like the dreaded word "BITCOIN."
You tell people what bitcoin is and they will say "its a currency to buy drugs, and launder money." You ask people what a dogecoin is and they will tell you a cute currency used for donations/charity, making friends etc. You can blame mainstream media for giving the word Bitcoin a bad name.
The average joe doesnt know that Bitcoin and doge are practically the same thing. All they know is that doge is the much user friendly choice of the cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin reminds me of Tamagotchi the virtual digital pet. Where people are treating this currency like a pet that has emotions and values etc. Thats what is goingto fuel its success.

Nice work but i would suggest you hire a second camerman to go with you and record your interview (hidden/or not) so your fans can watch the whole thing. FOX news tends to chop out certain pieces on interviews to get their agenda across, whatever it is.

BITCOIN is a digital currency, so go with a digital type/blockchain design.
@_date: 2014-01-26 09:35:55
Because bitcoin is a "free market." No insider trading here! No money pumped in to inflate the market.

Hey, i just emailed the guy...told him if his company did not accept bitcoin soon..i would go after this whole family
@_date: 2014-02-15 08:11:27
"We have failed in explaining Bitcoin to the world"
because MAINSTREAM media controls the information stream. If CNN, and FOX news says Bitcoin is for only laundering money, buying drugs etc. The rest of the world(sheeps) will believe it is so.
On the other hand, if some genius comes along and creates a VIRAL method of using bitcoins the world will know better.

This is just ANOTHER confirmation that Bitcoin is a milestone invention in internet history. Just as BIG as the creation of the universe and the internet itself.
Realistically, Bitcoins marketcap should be around 800+ trillion dollars. Imagine if Bitcoin replaced ALL 150+ currencies in the world? Completely replaced FIAT , period. That's where im getting my numbers from.

@_date: 2014-02-15 08:16:34
LOL, your an idiot for thinking "what should i do." Did you not know before hand that purchasing bitcoins is very volatile? Bitcoin was $990 a few months ago and your already "worrying." Bitcoin has the potential for $10,000 = 1 BTC by the end of the year. 
DONT pull your money out. Keep your $13,000 in there and invest for the "long term" and dont even think about it. Get on with your life. Bitcoin is growing at 1000% a year so stop this short term thinking because it making look like a fool. In 5-10 years your $13,000 investment will be $130,000,000 in the near future, trust me on that!
@_date: 2014-12-05 07:22:20

Just the fact that Apple was propriety in EVERYTHING they do is more than enough reason to dislike  them. I still wonder to this day why you apple users never saw that.
@_date: 2014-01-23 09:29:59
Not only would the price explode, governments around the world would try their best to ban/tax it. Its already happening in some countries around the world and bitcoin isnt even widely accepted yet.

OP hasnt factored in the banning of exchanges. If bitcoin was immune to exchange bans then i would believe you. Centralization is the meat and potatoes of this society. I dont see how the hell bitcoin will win against the centralized banking/governmental cartels of the world.

Bro, stop wasting your energy for ONE congressman! That congressman can do NOTHING for you even if he agrees to how great it is. 
I would suggest using your energy to market bitcoin in YOUR area, first. Have meetings with local merchants and "convince" them to accept bitcoin. Start with the local businesses/merchants first. The more businesses who accept bitcoin in your area the more "awareness" you will create for the people. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:30:52
You forgot to factor in the banning of exchanges,bro. At the end of this year we will how many countries will ban exchanges of bitcoin in their country

lol, this guy is an idiot complaining about the CURRENT state (infancy) of bitcoin. Tell this guy to comment on bitcoin 3-5 years from now. 
In the future mining will take less energy. More and more business will accept bitcoin offline/online etc

Great site..my suggestion would be if your doing public events/ live concerts have signs on display that you accept bitcoins to your audience. Huge QR codes for display etc. Will greatly increase awareness and you might get a couple donations.
@_date: 2014-02-04 23:30:30
Nice to to know but dont tell us redditers how you feel. Run out and convince all your friends, family, and co-workers about you thoughts. When you do live events tell your audience you accept bitcoins with large qr codes etc.
You'll be doing better justice spreading the word in your community.

Im not sure why you hating on these guys. I'd trust these guys with my money rather than coin base! These guys dont seem like the type to take your money and run like other exchanges have done.
After winning millions from the facebook case these guys could have just bought themselves a fucking island in the middle of the tropics and bang beautiful hookers all day, but no! Instead, they start a new business/venture to help create the future of the new world.

Someone here tell me why people hold dollars when it has no value? At least bitcoin has value with supply limit.
Does this prove that people of the world are just naturally stupid?
@_date: 2015-01-11 06:38:37
Im still confused on what gives bitcoin value vs paper currency. I understand that the value of bitcoin comes from its limited supply, decentralized and instant transactions etc. If this is the case why do dollars have value?
What gives dollars value when we don't know what the limits are? Can a currency that is infinite in supply really hold value like the dollar?
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:01:36
localbitcoin is the ONLY exchange for bitcoins. The online exchanges are the problem, not bitcoin code...lol
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:13:04
You gotta remember Bitcoin is a "worldwide currency." Superbowl is entirely an American sport. You should be thinking more of the olympics, boxing or the game of soccer. Those games are truly BIG on a world wide scale.
Or you can make a commercial for every country and target there popular trends etc. 
Now, the challenge is to find a great/inspirational video company willing to do the commercial. Next, is set up a crowd funding operation and make it go viral because were talking millions of dollars to get a few of them out there.

Yes, this is clunky technology. Western Union etc. money tranferers and bank wire transfers are still the EASIEST way to go.
With bitcoin, they would both have to set up account with coinbase or any other crypto exchange. Then once your buddy sends her the money, another problem arises! Where can she go to cash out the bitcoins for pesos?
There is a money changer and western union in EVERY corner in the philippines so i dont know how BITCOIN would be any easier.
If all of a sudden banks, western unions, and money transfer agencies started to accept bitcoin. Companies like coins.ph, rebit.ph etc (mentioned below) would ALL go out of business over night!
Banks and western unions are waiting until the masses start adopting bitcoin before thery start accepting it. So tell you friend to wait. Bitcoin wont get any easier anytime soon!
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:12:52
lol, not at all. I just want the convenience of walking in some "secure" establishment giving them cash and getting bitcoin in return with a 5%-10% service fee.
Now, if this experience does not exist why isn't some entrepreneur/investor trying to invest in this idea?
If I knew the guy wouldn't screw me , sure I would love to deposit my money into his account but I don't know the guy. Even paypal and ebay have buyer back assurance.
My concern is security and safety. Im pretty sure this is on EVERYONES mind who experiences bitcoin for the first time.
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:55:55
I know for sure the Philippines is full of money changers. Maybe you can ask/convince them to buy and sell bitcoin. Also update me on the pro's and con's if any.
