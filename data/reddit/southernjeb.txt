How do you amass that much money and still do stupid things with it?
Why on earth would you move that much to places with clear evidence of having issues.  Why not do multiple smaller wires????
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:08:28
Doesnt matter thats still stupid.  And i have an equal amount on coinbase just in ltc. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:27:18
Would say ripple is more like the Iron bank than jamie lannister...
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:38:03
Dont say stupid shit and then say its a joke because you now realize you sound like an idiot.

Thats the absolute worst way to ho about margin trading.  Trading to get back losses just leads to more losses. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:30:48

Awesome!  Thank you for this.  Ive been a lurker here and buying silver for a few years and have also played around with bitcoin. First purchase ive ever made with bitcoin and it saved me spending about and extra $20 at my local coin shop for the same purchase. 
Thanks brother,  ill have to let ya know how it goes

Because they didnt pay 100% of the value that was lost to everyone and they are forcing the tokens to be redeemed now. 
You arent receiving the true value of the lost coin.

For what its worth there were multiple efforts delving into this during the election.  I was lucky enough to be party to some people 'experimenting' with machine learning and observation of this. Purely as a hobby. However, some were doing waaay more in depth stuff and it was facinating.  
Especially when we uncovered the absolutely batshit types. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 01:18:35
Haha. 
Sometimes 4chan hits one out of the park.

Oil of milk sounds like something rich middle aged women would drop a ton of money on for skin rejuvenation.  I bet it would be like $50 an ounce.

"Glass surprised and disturbed a grizzly bear with two cubs. The bear charged, picked him up, bit and lacerated his flesh, severely wounded him, and forced him to the ground. Glass nevertheless managed to kill the bear with help from his trapping party, but was left badly mauled. The men were convinced Glass would not survive his injuries; nevertheless, they carried Glass on a litter for two days, but doing so greatly slowed the pace of the group's travel"
theres some existing sources which give testament to it occurring, but also that there is likely some embellishment to parts of the story.

Sweet, now i can finally find a legal representative to have lawyer file suit papers.
been waiting on support response since May 2017 for missing funds.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:47:36
it reminds me of the periods following each ATH over last 4 years. Then the subsequent profit taking which cascaded down and made top buyers shit their pants and sell. until everyone caught their breathe for  a couple months
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:02:01
Its a little late to avoid them when ive had $10k on there for 10 months awaiting support ticket response.   Hence why i asked for any ideas or help. Not feedback telling me to avoid them in the future, i think i hot that aspect down...
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:40:03
Well Im asking reddit to see if there is anything that has worked. Certainly someone else has attempted to go that route. The major point is that the company is incorporated in a different state (Delaware). My hope was that another redditor had gone that route already. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:40:05
Have had two open support tickets on Polo for over ten months now with no response.  
I was previously verified up to the $7,0000 daily withdraw limit. In process of switching from legacy to verified (hoping this will help the issue)
I have had zero response concerning missing funds and mysterious order issues. 
I have tried emailing, calling the officer of record for incorporation (they have changed), filed with better business bureau of Delaware, etc. 
Does anyone have any ideas how to get my funds or even a response to my tickets?
Edit: i understand all the comments and threads from people saying to avoid them, etc etc.  ive been looking at this for months.  I get it. But that doesnt help me when im already involved with them to the tune of over $10k. So I am looking for ideas that actually have worked for people or ways to get a response from the company. 
I have even called and spoken with the original company/agency that incorporated them. They said they get calls all the time but unfortunately cant do anything as they no longer represent Poloniex.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:56:01
Its not necessarily the cashing out. Its the zero response to support tickets regarding missing funds or trades that disappeared along with the funds, without being liquidated. And another 10k tied up in a trade that literally makes zero sense how it could possibly have a occurred without a glitch. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:26:28
Shit... im at ten months now waiting on a response to a ticket.  Zero options here for me.  
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:05:59
lol, not sure if your serious or not, but generally the time to cash out is nov-dec
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:48:38
Thats the legal agent liquidating under court orders to distribute funds to claimants.

I think theres a lot of bagholders commenting here that just dont wont to acknowledge this may not be good for ETH as it is currently.
