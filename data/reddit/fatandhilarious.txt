How long do you wait for the transaction to finish?
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:55:49
Where do you get that?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:22:04
For what?

What a shitty elitist prick with Asbergers.  Lol.

This kills Bitcoin for me.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:07:30
Because the market I use doesn't accept it.

So if I want to buy weed then I have to pay an extra $30?
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:12:29
So like $30 is not enough?
I think I'll just stop using BitCoin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:04:35
I don't understand that.
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:54:21
Is there any alternate service anyone can recommend?
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:28:00
What is BU?

What if I cash out then buy back after a low?
@_date: 2017-01-08 01:06:47
@_date: 2017-04-12 20:08:13
That part was easy.  You just find the Kraken wallet address and then send it that way.

I like to think I gained $2800 instead.
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:27:37
I've tried with Chrome and Firefox.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:21:17
I'm doing well. I bought in at $77 and sold at $1029. During that time BTC stayed at around $250 for months.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:59:47
That's me.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:19:44
I sold at $1000 but put all the money in an index fund.
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:55:06
Would Ethereum be better?
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:54:57
I can check it out. Thanks.
