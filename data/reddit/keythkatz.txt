It doesn't change the fact that $260m does not make it a big company. Big in terms of bitcoin accepters, but it's still small. The title makes it seem like $260m is a big company in the overall market. It's misleading and that's the point is trying to make.

Bitcoins don't secure wealth. In fact, letting the average joe keep his own wealth on his computer or a piece of paper is one of the worst ways to keep large sums of money. I'd much rather trust a bank to take care of my money for me than making a paper wallet that's worth nothing if my house burns down with it, or if it's stolen, misplaced... There's many ways for it to go wrong.
I'd be more willing to use Bitcoins to store my wealth once there are trustable, accountable, regulated banks to go along with it. But then I wouldn't use them unless they let me pay with them easily like Neo Bee. And at that point, why not use fiat, unless retailers give me a discount for paying in Bitcoins? It'll just be another card to carry around.
The real magic of Bitcoin is near-instantaneous money transmission at low fees, transferring money from one country to another in a few hours rather than days. The other uses currently provide no new incentives over fiat.

That's called a payment processor. Entirely different thing from a bank and has very important features for customer protection. At that point you're comparing MasterCard with Bitpay, and guess what: THERE'S MERCHANT FEES.

I'm relatively new to investing in general (only a few months), but the lack of knowledge in is really hard to see. After spending the last few months browsing and their sister subs, the ignorance in this sub is unbelievable. The worst part is, I can't tell who is truly ignorant and who is just doing it to circlejerk. It's a bit like @_date: 2013-12-05 02:07:55

How would bitcoin as a main currency help economy growth? Not saying it's impossible, but being able to print money to loan is kind of important for the growth of productivity, much like banks being able to lend more than they have.
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:38:50
I believe in it too. But just look at the usual posts on this sub when BTCUSD is going up - they're mostly "*TO THE MOON!*"-type posts and when it drops people worry about the price dropping and post "*Don't panic*"-type posts to try and keep it high.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:33:38
It's already factored in. Too late to do anything.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:50:12
Except it's the same reasons that a lot of people are getting into Bitcoin right now. The large price rise is from people thinking they can make a quick buck, not really because of a change in ideology. It's a lot easier to convince someone that "it makes money" rather that "this is good for everyone".

I'm in both the investment camp and the 'this is the future' camp. I believe that both Bitcoin and Litecoin can co-exist. It's not much different than having 100+ different fiat currencies. All of them have value. That said, I converted half of my Bitcoins to Litecoins because I think it has more potential for short term growth.

That to me implies displacing the primary currency.
Also in my original post I meant that it would be stupid for countries to adopt it as a primary currency, not that the point was stupid. Especially now, with the volatile price it'll have to be pegged to another currency anyway.
Also, switching means its citizens would have to buy a bunch of bitcoins, deflating it even more, which is of course what we all want in the end - to fill up our pockets. It'll be a really hard switch, compared to just printing another alternative currency. Any country switching to crypto would probably maintain their own fork of Bitcoin.

Now that this graph has been made, it'll start to deviate from the norm in the opposite direction that you want it to go. It's like a law of the universe or something.

I'm in both camps. In the long term, I think it is a viable currency. For now though, it's simply a high risk high return investment vehicle.

Yes, and whenever the topic of multiple coins comes up the consensus is that they can live together and complement each other rather than just straight out destroying the economy as would have me believe.

Cryptocurrencies aren't immune from market forces. Eventually it will stabilise at a price point like stocks and forex, then acceptance will come. It could be at $1000, $10000, or wherever. But it will come.

Very good point. Almost all of the new money coming in is because they see BTC going higher. You don't see as many articles talking about the future of BTC, but a lot of financial articles talking about where it may be going.

Except Litecoin isn't a scamcoin like Primecoin and others. The inventor of Litecoin even dumped his share of it at $0.2 because he thought it was too high. They're not in it for the money.

Well, I was horribly wrong. I still can't see why, everything is expected news. Not a single bit of surprise.
