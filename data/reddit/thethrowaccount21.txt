That is a false argument. Open source software has no such distinction. Furthermore, Bitcoin was never meant to be 'stewarded' by an 'authority'. Its an open source project. Any one can and should fork if they need to and they can call it what they like. That's called freedom.

Maybe you should stop stalking my posts and downvote brigading them in violation of the rules of reddit? Maybe you should stop trying to lie to everyone to support your coin. 
1 . Irrelevant. Whomever the attack is named after has nothing to do with whether or not its effective.
2 . The fact that it exists **AT ALL** is damning for your community. Your 'privacy coin' is the LEAST private with THE MOST privacy ending bugs.
3 . The fact that it exists **AT ALL** is damning for your community. Your 'privacy coin' is the LEAST private with THE MOST privacy ending bugs.

5 . It succinctly explains the flaws with your community's culture and handling of bad news/events:




You would hide this from others. That is dishonest behavior.
6 . The monero community likes to hide behind "Discussed already". Hey JUST BECAUSE YOU DISCUSS A BUG DOESN'T MEAN ITS FIXED. That's a cynical line of reasoning which shows how desperate you are.
7 . No it does not. All of monero's flaws listed are UNIQUE TO MONERO and require monero's unique architecture to work. Dash for example has a much higher anonymity set than Monero with 43,000,000 @ 16 rounds, ~6000 @ 8 rounds while monero is fixed at 11 for everyone. And that is just the most recent after you discovered how broken your chain was by timing analyses.
We can see how aggressive and forceful your community is whenever confronted about your coin. You lambast others, show no humility, pounce on trivialities as if they dismiss the research when they clearly don't:






Thank god they have your community to browbeat them and intimidate and threaten them into compliance. Where would we be without the aggressive and forceful monero community verbally assault and threaten our academics and researchers for DARING TO SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT HOLY SACRED MONERO!? /s

As we've discussed about a half dozen times, once you pay u/fireice_uk for the trace he provided below as was promised (despite your community's assurances that such was not possible), he will provide you a trace from 2018. Because you refuse to pay him, it doesn't happen, but using that as proof is cynical.




















Not at all. According to the wired article at one time **90% of monero transactions were traceable**. That number is now around 10%, but **no other privacy coin has had a similar breach**, for any length of time, let alone for the at least three years that monero was 90% traceable, nor for the 2 years it still remains 10% traceable, as well as the other numerous privacy-breaking bugs. I would ask you to stop following my comments on reddit, but I know that you will not respect my wishes.
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:27:24
You are definitely insistent I'll give you that. Your ability to ignore evidence and pigheadedly continue repeating falsehoods is to be commended in a twisted way...


Every time we've had this discussion over the last 3 years **YOU HAVE LOST/WALKED AWAY**. You should stop lying to everyone.


Oh great, up is down, black is white, traceable is untraceable. Gotcha.


According to the wired research:




So you say untraceable, researchers say, not only traceable, but surprisingly so. I.e. people didn't know how bad using Monero made their op-sec.


**NO OTHER COIN HAS A 10% TRACEABILITY!!!** It used to be 90% for Monero, then 45% as you increased the ring size in dramatic fashion. You truly are being dishonest.


Every researcher calls it that. Only you seek to deny it and play with words to trick others into using a coin that is less private than you advertise. Have you forgotten you and your community used to say that Monero was 'THE MOST PRIVATE COIN' and had 'THE STRONGEST PRIVACY'? Now you're making excuses for why 'Oh, 10% is not that bad teehee'. That is dishonest.


Lies. People should know that your coin's privacy was not only broken since the day it was released, but the 'fix' didn't really fix the problem and only made it 'less bad' as Fluffypony, core team and founding member expounds upon in the article:








Yeah, quote the rest of it:






You really are a dishonest person. You are trying to win a competition by **cheating and misleading others**.

Some of those are from before 2017, but having your privacy broken for 3 years is something people would want to know and it shouldn't be hidden. Others are quite recent and still effectively deanon you. One of the authors of those articles stated recently that Monero's privacy is broken as is:

From Andrew Miller's research:


**62% of transaction inputs with one or more mixins are
vulnerable to “chain-reaction” analysis — that is, the real
inYou extrapolate your logic beyond reason while not understanding the context of evidence (such as this misc. 20% claim in your comment) that you present.put can be deduced by elimination, e.g. because the
mixins they include are spent by 0-mixin transactions**.
Monero mixins are sampled in such a way that the
**mixins can be easily distinguished from the real coins by
their age distribution; in short, the real input is usually
the “newest” input**. We estimate that this heuristic can
be used to guess the real input with **80% accuracy over
all transactions with 1 or more mixins**. Our analysis uses
only public blockchain data, in contrast to earlier attacks
requiring active participation in the network [10, 7].
the first weakness primarily affects Monero transactions
made by older software versions (i.e., prior to RingCT),
the second weakness is applicable to the newest versions
as well. We propose and evaluate a countermeasure derived
from blockchain data that can improve the privacy of
future transactions.


The original challenge was: 




He did that and you refused to pay him. My quote isn't 'cut' at all, that is the summary of the discussion. No one questions whether that users is 'familiar with moneros history' or not. 


You're lying. 90% of your transactions were traceable.
Again, from the wired article:








So we have you saying 'nothing is traceable go back to sleep' and we have dedicated researchers directly contradicting you. In fact, the researchers wrote a website where they directly trace transactions:


























Clicking on the random button provides a trace:




We know it was spent in block 476238, transaction [b288cbd8...]
Admittedly these flaws were 'fixed' (to a degree at least). But the fact that they existed *at all* for three years since your coin was released, and the fact that you're trying to ignore this fact, is in itself damning. 
Finally, Monero has **always had a very low anonymity set** as I point out in this viral research thread here [Cutting to the chase or how to properly evaluate privacy coins!]( Monero's anonymity set is currently only 11. Originally it was **0 for years thanks to those flaws**. Then you bumped it to '3', then '5', then '7' and finally '11' after a series of emergency hardforks when these flaws were revealed to the public.

Hi James, I have a bitpay card. My question to you is do you or your company plan on adding support for Dash? Dash has instant transactions (5 POW confirmations in 1.3 seconds) on by default for all transactions, it has optional privacy through decentralized mixing, and other advanced features I'm sure your team would love to take a look at. You guys should definitely consider adding it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:48:51
If they owned a significant amount of bitcoin I think that would be a good assumption to make. Do you know if that is true or not? Otherwise you can never know someone's intentions...

Dash's blocks run on an average of every 2.5 minutes...
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:46:11
Thanks for that, that was exactly the kind of thing I was thinking of. However, my question remains. Even those using bitcoin as 'digital gold' have to be able to use it to settle their transactions. 1 MB constrains the amount of people who can use that functionality. In other words, there should be another slider that accounts for the effect (total number of transactions increased or decreased) by various hard limits to the blocksize. I'm sure done correctly, that analysis will show a static price beyond a certain valuation of the 'percentage of gold market cap' slider.

How? Bitcoin's price is based on supply and demand. Supply is governed by the mining algos whose parameters are specified in the whitepaper and code. So we know what the max supply is going to be for the future. What about demand?
Demand is based on many fuzzy things, but the basics are usefulness/utility. Even 'SoV' people are claiming that its utility is in 'storing value' whatever that means. When the price moves wildly, I would think the last use case you'd be touting was the store of value one, but that's me.
But the point is, if these people didn't think Bitcoin reliably worked as a SoV, then that percentage of demand would eventually disappear. So it looks like this prediction is based on continuing growth in demand for bitcoin given that supply is already known. The problem with this is that demand is based on successfully executing your use cases. So bitcoin is having trouble as a payment network. Constraining it to 1MB will ensure that that is the case for the near future. Which means that Demand will be constrained by the throughput of a single block and only those who view bitcoin as a store of value will continue to show demand, so how can the price rice much more than it is now? Even with speculation, if the demand doesn't materialize (due to people finding out the fees are too high, or wait times too long, or not usable at PoS, etc.) then the price will crater if supply stays the same (which it will).

Ah I see, thanks. But doesn't this bode poorly for bitcoin? I mean, it effectively was strong-armed by the dev team. Segwit was only accepted due to the NYA. Now core has put significant pressure on others to maintain their position. That is a major red-flag.

That is the scenario. Ask yourself what an attack on BTC would look like. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:44:56
Because bitcoin is digital gold, that means it must replicate gold's slowness. You wouldn't try to pay for lunch with a gold nugget would you? In fact, another property of bitcoin that is not amenable to the gold comparison is its easy divisibility. Core should devise a difficult to implement method of preventing bitcoin from easily being divisible. Don't' remove the functionality completely, just make it really, really hard to use. That way, bitcoin will be even more like godl and we can all hodl some more!
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:35:32


Considering that the lead development team for Bitcoin core has thwarted, through lying and underhanded tactics, not one but TWO agreements aimed at compromise, it is not at all a fallacy to assume that they plan to keep 1MB, especially with this recent 2x fake move they tried to pull. 


This sounds noble, but considering the high fees and trans backlog, is the equivalent of pontificating about better building foundations and improved concrete pour techniques (10% more concrete throughput) while you're house in on fire. Your priorities should reflect the urgency of the situation.
Anyone who had the best interest of the network in mind, REGARDLESS of how they feel about L2 and L3 solutions, would advocate raising the block size, even if to 2 MB to buy time for the testing and implementation of those features. Lightning network has been advertised for years now! Where is it? You can't say you needed segwit, you could've implemented it on testnet then developed a first-pass at lightning. But they DIDN'T DO THAT. Nothing responsible or 'safe' about that. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:30:46
So will segwit be reversed as well? Because the only reason segwit passed was because of the 2x nya (Before that it was barely signalling at 30%).

As a general rule, in relationships, and anytime in general, one should maintain strict, complete, 100% control over their assets. Not as a sign of selfishness, but as a symbol of sovereignty. That way, whatever you share must've come from the heart and not from the barrel of a gun.
