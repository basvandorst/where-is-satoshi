A 51% attack allows the attacker to split the block chain. They now how control over new blocks and can confirm coins being in two locations. This essentially gives them an infinite amount of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin adoption isn't at this level yet. For the same reason Overstock sells their BTC to pay their suppliers, charities couldn't buy emergency goods with bitcoin. 
I say we either help companies that supply emergency goods adopt bitcoin or start our own. Starting our own would be the ultimate charity.

If they were selling Bitcoin for cash then they would still need a briefcase full of cash.

If one pool has control of 51% of the network then, theoretically, they could force double spends. A double spend occurs when the same coins are sent to two different locations. 
Currently, the decentralized nature of having many individual miners working prevents any one entity from doing a double spend. This is why many people panicked.

This is true, they wouldn't be able to do a true arbitrage to another exchange. That being said, if lots of sell orders are placed the price will still be driven down even if the fiat transfers are never made.

Mining bitcoin for the small guy is over. Switch to a scrypt coin, mine it and convert to BTC.

The Catch 22 is that without initial capital, developing the promised hardware is very tough. It would be better to take a small percentage of the full price and then charge the rest when it's finished.
It makes me wonder though, how can you determine the price for a product before you even know how much it's going to cost to make?

Given the audio, stripped of all personal details, I would be willing to translate it. This way we would at least have written documentation of what was said.

It's not about blindly following the Gox price. When one exchange moves significantly in on direction or the other, it becomes profitable to buy BTC on one exchange, and sell on the other. 
That arbitrage keeps most exchanges very close.
