You definitely don't... and you don't know why it hit $10k either. So here's to not speculating any further because this is straight up gambling

Ah, the sudden influx of "gurus" who capitalized on a chance spike and now are proclaiming that they know the way of the future now... You do realize that the best way to predict the future is to know your history right?

You're literally talking about the lowest common denominator. That has to make up at least 40% of any market cap, including Indexes/ETF's and Dead/Lost Stock. There's the middleweights who include the DT's (day-traders), hedges, private long-holders / equity stakeholders. Then you have the 10% at the top who definitely have inside information who stagger out their buy/sell plan years in advance because the SEC only requires you to publish basic P/L's as far as I'm concerned. Also, rational =/= index funds... It's like saying all those people who bought into index funds pre-08 that enjoyed the success of a Housing Futures ETF up until that point were rational.

This is the reason I shorted BTC after the 15,000 mark. If BTC has an inherent value it has to be the entrepreneurial spirit and technological advances of its users... I just started seeing the same rent-seeking, consumer-driven retards just like every other financial asset that got too manic attention from the public...

Inherited success doesn't last 2 generations and definitely doesn't last 3. Money is a valuable resource but our gene pool doesn't reflect bank statements. The reason I started shorting BTC around 15-16k was because I began to see coffee shop grandmas and construction workers yamming about BTC and claiming its futures... That's when I knew I was out. When people who want to get something for nothing and they know nothing... and enough of them are there... that is a bad sign

If the reason you're investing in BTC is because of two PhD economists at the Fed..... why the fuck are you investing in BTC?

Except your scientific metaphor on comparing early BTC adopters to the house doesn't really hold up to the concept of evolution as it's processed slowly over millions of years. Nice anthropocentric fallacy though. It's a zero-sum game and if people want to consistently make money they have to do the opposite of what the crowd is doing. That I can guarantee.

I never disputed the legitimacy of crypto. Widespread adoption is necessary for a currency to grow out of a hobbyist incubation phase, but when that happens the same principles of investing applies. I'm pretty sure I don't need to repeat what that is here, you and everyone here knows it. 
The public is emotionally driven, and people who are willing to jump into something that they have no idea about are equally eager to jump out and thus, be manipulated.

The thing is bad investors don’t last long in the markets. Either they get burned so hard they can’t afford to play anymore or they’re too afraid to return. What we’re seeing now is mid level investors who put a little too much percentage and hope of their portfolios into crypto (and stock for that matter) when bonds are necessary for a bottom line

Hot-take. It isn't like other CC's have shown volatility that's perpendicular to BTC's
