Yeah, I don't want to get on the bad side of the IRS. Thanks for the input. Ill check with some accountants at work and see what my options are.

Damn same here

HAHA you have a point. When I typed it seemed like a longer time frame. Ya boys been in the hold game with the stocks for a while but I just caught the wild hair to sell. Any chance that shit will get taxed? It never left the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:39:54
Even with the transaction never leaving the exchange? I didnt think of that either, to be honest.

I believe Atl would be perfect.

Exactly, if anything i got lucky. The small amount of time between the trades were stressful I don't short or day trade so I was out of my element 100 percent. Bummer on the ltc deal. Hope you can get back in!

Right, I knew about the stock situation. I guess I'll just continue to hold as usual. Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:41:28
Yes, any amount that you could lose and still be able to survive

sounds right, hmm would have sold at 16k and swung back in tomorrow if I had paid more attention. Prolly on HODL mode tomorrow then. Thanks!

No hate intended its news about bch. Cant only address the positive things about a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:42:01
Damn, I never thought percentages. Im gonna mimic this route. Thanks man!
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:24:57
Right, I agree completely. The investments im making now are already out of mind once they hit. Just seems like this coin is going to high places at a rapid rate.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:40:59
jaja I saw that joke coming as I typed. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:23:36
Man o man, wouldn't that be grand.
