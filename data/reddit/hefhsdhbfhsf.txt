Made up of the Coinbase index?
@_date: 2018-09-07 12:25:49
I’m waiting to see if this dip is going to continue
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:59:15
Exactly. The whole point of Bitcoin is it gives people fiancial freedom. They now have the CHOICE to hold custody of their money. They don't have to.
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:00:30
You have to include a lot more than M1. You could easily see &gt; 5kk in today’s $ equivalent per bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:41:40
Yea that just disproved their point.

Lightning transfers between exchanges is the significant application. That is what I’m waiting for.
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:20:02
I think I’ve seen estimates thrown around that 5 million BTC is already lost from circulation.

There are other alternatives. If you don’t like there service then just use someone else like any other service. That’s my opinion. Decentralized tech in its current capacity is only good for some things as decentralized networks are inherently less efficient.

If you are looking on upside though there is no guarantee that Bitcoin will be on top. Obviously it is the least risky investment.
@_date: 2018-10-13 21:41:55
You don’t need a decentralized everything. Telegram works fine, if you don’t lie my here service then go to a competitor. Value needs to be decentralized because it’s how we live, it’s the centerpiece of our ability to survive.
@_date: 2018-10-19 14:58:03
Yes, there is. Centralized exchanges have more volume and liquidity.
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:44:26
So OMG and REP aren’t reputable projects and shouldn’t count?
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:43:07
SegWit did help but the main reason for the decline in fees is the decline in transactional volume on the network.

That is true that everyone optimizes and would want to hold a deflationary asset. The thing that you are leaving out is that anyone should be able to stake/delegate in most circumstances meaning that they can protect the value of their wealth fairly easily so it mitigates the effect of inflation. So in that case, many individuals would be open to owning an inflationary asset- when they can partake in the inflation mechanism with little effort and minimal cost.

I disagree. This is why I believe that POS is a better economic model for security. A 1% increase in the supply per year is ok. In proof of stake, anyone can easily participate in the inflation mechanism for short terms. Also the inflation is transparent which also makes much better than how things operate today. A low inflation rate is ok if it is transparent and anyone can participate without permission in my eyes.
@_date: 2018-07-24 01:19:06
Ah that is true in a way. I was just thinking of it because it’s tends to have an infinite inflation model but that does have nothing to do with POS. You’re right.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:00:34
Wait so you can still instantly withdraw your bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:47:24
Sounds like Hillary.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:52:59
When exchange to exchange transfers are done though lightning then it will only go lower.
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:43:49
No way we see that kind of volatility at those market caps.
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:52:19
That would mean that statistically it’s not favorable to lend money is you only get 1% but there is a 1% chance of default. You would end up with zero net profit. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:26:45
With a $7,000 limit. Damn that is hype.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:46:44
That’s would be huge.
