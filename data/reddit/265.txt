Dividends are not related to bitcoin price but the share price is.
1 share = 0.07 BTC when BTC = $600. So when BTC = $6,000 one share will be 0.007 BTC (assuming everything else is constant)

At least they aren't created like fiat... And also there is a cap of 21M bitcoins.

A bit should be indivisible. Thinking of 0.25 bits is killing my brain.
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:28:21
They were 0.075 last week. Good thing I didn't get in.

Top 14k people hold 8.8M BTC. And there aren't even 14k nodes. If they don't care why should I?
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:41:24
plus it is divisible. Real bits are not.

I mean, you can send someone 0.25 bits (25 satoshis).

Bitcoin is a "coin" type, not a "bit" type. You can say µcoin or µBTC but not bits or µbit.

What I'm saying is, windows uses "MB" instead of "MiB". 
@_date: 2015-05-31 10:33:36
No one uses that stupid standard. If you create 21 MB file on windows it will be 22020096 bytes.  I'm sure current block size is 1048576 bytes not 1 million.

Whats the point of using bitcoin then? Its no different than fiat if you don't have the private key.
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:52:45
But if nobody keeps their private key, then those "bitcoin banks" can create bitcoins in the future (since everyone does not withdraw their bitcoins at the same time). So it would be no different than fiat. I don't see any point using bitcoin if you don't have the keys.

It will show all of your used addresses + 5 unusued addresses. You can easily test this with portable version of electrum.
