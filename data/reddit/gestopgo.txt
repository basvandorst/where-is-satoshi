Wow. That is seriously the worst advice I've ever heard in my life. Bar none. Seriously. Internet or otherwise that takes the cake. I was once advised to piss on an electric fence and what you just said makes the kid that told me to do that look like a fucking guru.
I hope you don't live near a casino or help form national policies (hell, any policy) of any sort.

So the people who lost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars just get a pat on the head and a consolatory, 'free market economics lol''?
Mt. Gox just beebopped away with a king's ransom and everyone on this sub just can't wait to tell the next rube about how now is the best time to buy Bitcoin...it truly boggles my mind.

A currency system without regulation and oversight cannot work. The free market sure corrected itself but just look at the wreckage. People lost their livelihoods. And this will happen...every...single...time. 
But surely everyone will be honest next time. Right? Scouts honor? Pinkie swear?

So let me get this straight. A group waltz off with 100's of millions of dollars that belong to someone else and you just want to whitewash the whole thing?
Seems legit. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Another slick shyster will move in and just keep robbing you as long as you have that 'just forget it guys' attitude and  the foresight of a 14 year old.
