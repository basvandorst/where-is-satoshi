**UPDATE** After speaking to Coblee, Coinbase did the right thing and gave me the BTC that I purchased. Even though this should have been done earlier I appreciate Charlie making sure the right thing was done.

Dude why would I lie about this? I have been suffering through this nightmare.

ccstoudemire is my email. I sent you a message on twitter and an email to you and Brian.

Coblee, I understand but I have been a coinbase customer for years. If you all don't want to do business with me thats fine I will go elsewhere. But to just take my 10k USD and just hold onto it with terrible customer service is not a solution. Either give me BTC or don't but don't take my money and hold onto it. No prob if you were are worried about me committing fraud but now it looks like Coinbase is being the scammer by just taking my money like this. My email on the account is ccstoudemire I have nothing to hide.

I agree I was legit ready to invest but then I realized I didn't really even know what exactly I was getting. Just throwing money at something cause it sounds like a good idea is not smart

My payment has been stuck for 5 hours now. Whats going on?!

Screw coinbase they cancelled all my orders and are holding on to 10k with out giving me coins. When will I get my money?
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:49:27
First they were telling me it was my fault and on my banks side. So i spent an hour at the bank only to have coinbase start choosing to decline my transactions. Really terrible service. As the market grows they are going to get washed out due to this bush-league service+ fees

Whats confusing is when will I be be refunded? How can you all just throw around numbers without sticking to a firm time frame? How can a Business run like this?

Coinbase has 10k of my money since last week with no BTC to show for it. Should have had my refund yesterday. Terrible
