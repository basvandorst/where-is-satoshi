Isn't it true that if you but at semi-regular intervals throughout the year that you have basically bought at that year's average price? That's how it generally works when buying silver. I'm pretty new to bitcoin, but I feel like that might be a better way to look at it.

Oh I see, thanks. Edited.

Hopping on to bump . The user rating and feedback systems work really well,  the community is great, and you'll find better deals buying or selling than will on a dealer site or eBay. Many of the posts there also show the metals being sigma tested, to prove legitimacy.

Sigma verifier isn't destructive, if you can afford one. I also don't think that acid testing is destructive if it's real, unless it's like, super thickly plated. Someone correct me if I'm wrong about acid testing.

Apmex takes bitcoin on their website though.

Wait, now I'm confused. Is this the incorrect part of the comment?

I believe that there's still the regular tx fee, gdax just does not charge an exchange fee on top of that like Coinbase does. However, gdax also usually foots the bill for that regular tx fee, but you are limited to--I believe--30 tx's a month without fees.  
I'm new to crypto, so take this information for what it is, and someone please correct me if I'm wrong. 
Edit: Gdax does not have a limit on free tx's, my mistake.

And this is--one of--the true dangers of whistleblowing military and government secrets. It allows one person or organization the power to pick and choose context and shape any narrative they want. Even if they start off altruistic, they will always have the power to present information motivated by an agenda. Wikileaks had a certain level of credibility based on the danger that people like Assange placed themselves in, but since they are in a position of peril, they are open manipulation. And, unlike journalists and news organizations, any criticism or doubt of credibility can be written off as governmental counter-espionage or something.  
  
While I think that truth and accountability of governments is very important, it is imperative that an organization that deals in classified information like Wikileaks be as unbiased as possible. There can be no semblance of agenda except one of objective truth. The problem is that there can be no accountability of them because their organization is deconstructionalist by nature, and because the information they are releasing is classified and therefore difficult to verify or establish context around, they could potentially say whatever they want.
