Yeah, I can understand the disappointment that someone might have in a situation like that. I think the best way to handle a situation like that would be to set the expectation ahead of time by saying something along the lines of, "I'm about to send you money, but to ensure the security of the Bitcoin network, you won't be able to send your newly-received money right away." Or something like that. You can probably come up with something better than what I just came up with.

The only 2 Bitcoin wallets that I have on my iOS device are BreadWallet and Airbitz. One thing that both of them have in common is that they both give you full control over your private keys.
I personally find myself using Airbitz more often, because I enjoy all the extra features of Airbitz. For example, Airbitz has a built-in directory of Bitcoin-accepting merchants, which makes it perfect for newbies to answer the age-old question, "Are there any businesses in my area that accept Bitcoin?". 
Also, for more advanced users, there are a lot of customizable options. For example, Airbitz lets me choose what denomination I want to see my Bitcoin balance in (milliBits, bits, or Bitcoins), and it lets me tag all of my transactions with metadata (payee name, accounting category, etc.)... and Airbitz will encrypt all that data locally on my device and then back it up for me.
So I think it's perfect for both newbies &amp; advanced users alike! :)

Precisely. Every single person in the Bitcoin community needs to back Gavin's proposal on increasing the block size, or else we're going to end up with transaction fees that are even more expensive that Western Union! Bitcoin transactions are supposed to be open to everyone in the world at an almost-free cost. If people have to start paying 10% or 20% transaction fees, not only have we lost the battle for the future, but we have actually made finance WORSE for the world instead of BETTER.

I do wish that Satoshi didn't walk away from the project because it would be amazing to watch the original creator in action on a regular basis (sort of like it was amazing watching Steve Jobs run Apple), but I don't have a gigantic problem with him holding 10% of the coins... I don't believe that Satoshi would do something rash that would destroy his very own creation (such as plummeting the price by selling as many of his coins as possible). Plus, tech innovators are usually rewarded handsomely for their inventions. For example, Steve Jobs probably owned 10% of Apple shares at one point in time, and Mark Zuckerberg probably owned 10% of Facebook shares at one point. But I could be wrong about all of this -- maybe we SHOULD be concerned that he owns 10% of the coins?!

Blockchain.info is not dependable nor reliable nor secure. They will also show transactions as having $0.00 miners fees attached, even when transaction fees WERE attached. For blockchain exploring, I would recommend using  nstead.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:17:41
Thank you for the compliments, and you are right -- it is not fair for me say "perverse incentives", because it does seem like they want to keep Bitcoin decentralized too. This is actually a trickier &amp; more nuanced issue than I made it seem.
My concern in this debate is the exact same concern as yours: keeping the network as decentralized as possible. That is of the utmost importance to me. 
Yet if the block size stays at 1 MB, it seems to me that this actually INCREASES centralization because it pushes most of the transactions to centralized companies that process off-chain transactions. That concerns me because with the majority of these off-chain networks, you are not in control of your own keys  anymore, which makes it about as centralized as you can get! ;) Plus, we've already seen some censorship &amp; tracking of transactions with Coinbase. So, we're right back to a Paypal-like world again.
So if we kept a small block size but Bitcoin adoption increases, it seems to me that people will be forced to use these off-chain networks, because normal peer-to-peer transactions on the "real blockchain" might not get confirmed for a day, 2 days, maybe even 3 or 4 days or longer. And if the transactions are not getting confirmed for a while but people still want to use the real blockchain, it seems to me that people would bump up their fees to try to get their transactions confirmed quickly. But if it gets too expensive, people will either (a) turn to other non-Bitcoin payment methods which could cause Bitcoin adoption to fall (i.e. back to credit cards again), or (b) turn to these off-chain Paypal-like services. 
I'm actually not totally opposed to all of these off-chain services (for example, I love ChangeTip!!), but I think everyone should have the choice whether they want to transact off-chain or on-chain. 
Gavin said that he doesn't believe that a 20 MB block would increase centralization. He believes that the increased cost of mining a 20 MB block (vs. a 1 MB block) at this point is only about $20 or $30 more per month, which shouldn't increase centralization by much (if at all). Gavin also believes that with the increase in bandwidth &amp; CPU over the next 5-10 years, that this minimal extra cost will dwindle to almost nothing. So he believes that if you extrapolate bandwidth &amp; CPU trends into the future, that in about 5 or so years, the average home computer should be able to process every single transaction as full nodes, even with a 20 MB blocksize, which would still keep things very decentralized.
But as you implied, this is not a completely cut-and-dry issue. There is a lot of guesswork involved (on both sides) as to what the future holds.

@_date: 2015-06-27 23:04:11
So true. The current 1 MB block size prevents more than 250,000 people per day from using Bitcoin. 250,000 people! In a world of 7 billion people? Greece alone has 10 million people in it! Less than 2.5% of the people in Greece could use Bitcoin on a daily basis (and way less than that, considering that people in other countries might be using it as well). It's a shame that certain high-profile members of the community want to prevent Bitcoin from being used worldwide as a global currency. Those people are completely detrimental to Bitcoin's long-term future. Unless the block size increases dramatically, Bitcoin isn't getting adopted by any large groups of people anytime soon. And it certainly isn't going to be adopted by any countries. It simply doesn't have the capability to do so.

@_date: 2015-06-07 13:09:31
Your reward for speaking the truth is the community downvoting this post. What you say is true. Keeping the block size at 1 MB will basically destroy Bitcoin's future, which is exactly what people like Luke-Jr and Peter Todd are trying to do, so they can profit from their own off-chain services. Satoshi himself stated that there should be no block size limit.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:50:39
Oh yeah? Ask Mike Hearn or Gavin Andresen if this is hyperbolic nonsense.
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:24:34
Oops, Peter Todd has an off-chain service, not you.
Satoshi added the block size limit as a temporary measure only. Gavin talks about this in the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast here: 
Any time transactions are taken off the blockchain, it causes more potential security problems &amp; more centralization. 
On another note, you yourself tried to introduce blacklisting &amp; whitelisting into the Bitcoin network, which is precisely the exact opposite of what Bitcoin stands for. So how could you ever be trusted to decide what is beneficial for Bitcoin's future? 
@_date: 2015-06-06 20:19:15
In the future, use AirBitz or Breadwallet. Blockchain.info has sadly become an unreliable app &amp; service, and has had security issues in the past, too.
@_date: 2015-06-25 22:12:35
That is a common mistake. Blockchain.info is a privately-owned company which took the name blockchain for their own domain name, so newbies are confused by that. 
What you're thinking of is "the blockchain", which is the shared public ledger where all transactions are recorded, and is not owned by any company. There are many different tools available to view &amp; analyze this public ledger known as "the blockchain". For example, you can use the website  (now owned by Coinbase) to view the blockchain as well. 
Oh, by the way, I mentioned this above, but I think [Airbitz]( is the best mobile wallet -- it gives you full control of your keys, gives you full privacy, has a built-in directory of Bitcoin-accepting merchants, gives you the ability to add metadata to all of your transactions, and it locally encrypts then backs up all of your metadata for you!

Yes, yes, and yes. If you want to see mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, continued low transaction fees, and continued decentralization of Bitcoin, then we must raise the block size limit and we must do it now. This topic is discussed at length in the most recent "Let's Talk Bitcoin" podcast:

Nobody that I have EVER interacted with has a problem with waiting a few minutes to spend the money that they just received. How quickly can you spend the money you receive via a credit card payment or Paypal or Venmo? Up to 3-4 business days? And then have the money potentially reversed on you 6 months later? No thank you. I'd rather have Bitcoin. After one confirmation, I can pretty much guarantee that the money is mine and in my hands. After 6 confirmations, I know that it is virtually impossible for the transaction to reverse.

I've noticed the exact same thing in my discussions. The "adults" are extremely dismissive of Bitcoin, while the "kids" are super-excited about it. However, one thing that I've done that gets even the "adults" to be excited about it (if they will give me a few extra minutes of their time) is if I can get them to download the Airbitz wallet (which is my  favorite wallet app, because it includes a local directory AND users are in control of their own keys AND it has a very user-friendly experience). After they download the Airbitz wallet, I instantly send them $1 or $2 worth of Bitcoin. As soon as they receive it on their end -- just a moment later, with no fees nor bank accounts on their end -- they unanimously light up with excitement. And the cool Airbitz sound effects makes even the most jaded adult giggle with glee. People need to see it in action to truly understand it.

Lol. They have some perverse incentive to raise transaction fees by keeping block sizes small, when Satoshi's original vision was to keep transaction fees low.

Hm, that guy doesn't seem to understand the root of the block size problem, which is much larger than the "transaction fees going up by a few cents". If the block size isn't increased, the transaction fees would actually go up by a LOT more than a few cents, plus we could potentially lose the entire decentralized nature of Bitcoin. I discuss more in my post here:

This is an excellent post. As I said in another thread:
The most important thing that we should be concerned about is keeping the network as decentralized as possible. That should be of the utmost importance to everyone who cares about Bitcoin.

And if the transactions are not getting confirmed for a while but people still want to use the real blockchain, it seems to me that people would bump up their fees to try to get their transactions confirmed quickly. And I'm not talking about the fees getting bumped up by a penny. I'm talking about $15-$20 or more... in the realm of wire transfer fees. But if it gets too expensive, people will either (a) turn to other non-Bitcoin payment methods which could cause Bitcoin adoption to fall (i.e. back to credit cards again or Western Union again or wire transfers again), or (b) turn to these off-chain Paypal-like centralized Bitcoin services. 
I'm actually not opposed to all of these off-chain centralized services (for example, I love using ChangeTip!), but I think everyone should have the CHOICE whether they want to transact off-chain or on-chain. But note (again) that even well-trusted &amp; well-loved &amp; well-respected services like ChangeTip control your keys, partake in censorship, and charge high fees to move your Bitcoins away from their network.
Gavin said that he doesn't believe that a 20 MB block would increase centralization. He believes that the increased cost of mining a 20 MB block (vs. a 1 MB block) at this point is only about $20 or $30 more per month, which shouldn't increase centralization by much (if at all).

Gavin makes several convincing arguments for why the spam/DoS problem is not a problem. I am not as technically-literate as Gavin, so I can't faithfully reiterate his statements here. 




Not necessarily if the trusted third party can actually be trusted, but the whole point of Bitcoin is to eliminate the need for a trusted third party.

@_date: 2015-06-10 13:48:47
Maybe because it is a super high-risk investment, with no guarantee that our Bitcoin experiment will last? For example, if the block size isn't increased, then Bitcoin will basically sputter and die, because the Bitcoin network will never be able to handle more than the tiny &amp; unacceptable amount of transactions that it can handle now. 
You'll notice that the true investors are investing in companies which can use ANY cryptocurrency as the backbone of their companies. For example, Coinbase's business model is not fully dependent on Bitcoin -- they can easily switch to any cryptocurrency they choose.

Outside of the anonymity that comes from purchasing porn or illegal substances with Bitcoin, there is ABSOLUTELY ZERO benefit for consumers at this point for purchasing any items with Bitcoin. That is probably the reason why Bitcoin hasn't gone mainstream yet… there is ZERO advantage for the consumers. All the advantages are on the side of the merchant. 
Why would consumers spend a 1% fee to buy Bitcoins with Coinbase.com, wait 7 days for their Bitcoins to arrive, then watch as their volatile purchase swings up &amp; down in price dramatically, then make a purchase from a website with absolutely no dispute-resolution recourse if the transaction goes bad, then pay another .0001 BTC transaction fee to make the Bitcoin transaction?
Meanwhile, consumers can buy goods online with their credit cards, they can make the purchase instantly with no waiting, they can earn frequent flyer miles or hotel points or Amazon credit because they shopped with their rewards-based credit card, they get the advantage of dispute resolution, they can use a currency with a stable value on a daily basis, and they don't have to pay a 1% fee to do so. 
It makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE AT ALL for consumers to purchase anything in Bitcoin. How can Bitcoin ever go mainstream with so many disadvantages working against it? As Gavin Andresen says, this is just an experiment. But in my opinion, I just can't personally see how this experiment ever gets to the mainstream. Too many insurmountable problems to overcome, from my point of view. If it was going to go mainstream, I feel like it probably would have happened by now.

This is the heart of the problem. Some people just want Bitcoin to be a store of value. Other people want Bitcoin to be a global currency.

Of course, the irony is that we don't need the banks at all to use Bitcoin, since Bitcoin makes them completely irrelevant. But in these early days, they are a very convenient on-ramp &amp; off-ramp into the Bitcoin ecosystem.
This is why the rest of us -- those of us who have the legal ability to purchase &amp; use &amp; innovate with Bitcoin -- need to make Bitcoin a centerpiece in our lives, so it can spread to the point where people are using it everywhere, and there would be too much protest &amp; backlash from the citizens to let this sort of bullshit happen.

Love how he admits that all fiat money is created out of thin air as debt, yet all of that debt needs to be repaid WITH INTEREST. Um... if all the fiat money is originally created as debt to begin with, where are the interest payments going to come from? Hmm... suddenly it seems like his beloved fiat currency is the real scam here, not Bitcoin.

The only way to stay anonymous with Bitcoin is to buy Bitcoins in person from someone with cash, probably by finding somebody on LocalBitcoins.com. Otherwise, your purchases are traceable forever, and can be linked back to you. If you buy from Coinbase, you're basically allowing the government to track everything you do, much like purchasing with a credit card.

This happened to me 2 months ago. It took about 5 or 6 days for the transaction to fall off the network and for the funds to be spendable again from my wallet.
Ironically, blockchain.info was the only remaining node which was holding onto my transaction for that long. All the other nodes dropped the unconfirmed transaction within about 2 days. So blockchain was the node which was holding me up the longest. 
This sort of situation also proves that there really is no such thing as a "free transaction" in the Bitcoin world. Any transaction made without a fee will likely fail. This also goes to show why no merchants should ever release any products or services until at least receiving 1 confirmation.

The porn industry has always been the key to mainstream adoption of any new technology. Bitcoin is ALREADY particularly useful for porn industry websites, for people who want to keep their purchases private.
But now, the banks are illegally shutting down porn stars' bank accounts due to moral reasons!

I actually find Circle's website less intuitive than Coinbase's website for beginners. And I think that their exchange rate is worse than Coinbase's (which makes up for the lack of a 1% fee).

Absolutely. When I first heard about Bitcoin, I didn't even know that you COULD make money from holding onto it. The only 2 things I knew about Bitcoin was that: (1) WikiLeaks was able to get around its financial blockade with Bitcoin, and (2) that the Cypress citizens who got screwed by their banks were able to turn to Bitcoin as a safe haven. These two things smelled like freedom to me, and I am a huge believer in freedom. THAT is what got me excited about Bitcoin, and that is still what gets me excited about Bitcoin today.

Thank you very much for the 2 explanations, Aaron! :) 
It seems like other popular apps -- such as Evernote, Dropbox, LogMeIn, etc. -- don't use the iOS Keychain in this way (i.e. they always require a complete reconfiguration from scratch after a fresh reinstallation). Why did you choose to preserve the data in the iOS Keychain after deleting the app? Is it because you figured that more people would be in a situation where they ACCIDENTALLY deleted the app without writing down their backup code first, vs. the number of people who would sell/give away their phone without wiping it?
What about in a situation where the iPhone is stolen or lost while the iPhone screen is unlocked (which happened to a friend of mine at a bar), where we wouldn't have a chance to do a factory reset of the device before someone else gained control of the iPhone? It seems like a thief could potentially work his way through the PIN code and then have access to our BreadWallet wallet eventually? How many failed PIN attempts before breadwallet locks them out? And what happens if they simply delete &amp; re-download breadwallet? Would the PIN attempts start all over again from zero?
Many thanks for your explanations.

The Bitcoin article mentioned below is a good example. Another example is their article on fluoroquinolone antibiotics (e.g. Cipro, Levaquin, and Avelox). Their article is completely in line with the pharmaceutical industry's talking points about the "amazing safety record" of fluoroquinolones. In actuality, these are the most deadly drugs on the market with an over 90% rate of side effects, many of them severe and permanent. These antibiotics have been banned in many countries. They are supposed to only be given out to people on their deathbeds after all other options have been exhausted, yet in the quest for profits, the pharmaceutical industry has marketed it successfully to doctors as an all-purpose antibiotic to be given out for everything. These antibiotics have been directly linked as the cause of Gulf War Syndrome, fibromyalgia, tendinosis, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, Parkinson's Disease, permanent nerve damage (neuropathy), mitochondrial dysfunction, and so many other "mystery illnesses". Here's a great story about them:

Yes, America is totally screwed, but the ECB and its participating banks are just as criminal as the American banks. They're all printing currencies out of thin air, and manipulating exchanges. 
But what regulations are you so incredibly eager to see for Bitcoin and Blockchain based technologies? 
In the meantime, I feel that the Bitcoin entrepreneurs have done an amazing job ON THEIR OWN at heightening consumer protections since Mt. Gox... without any government forcing them to do it. It just makes good business sense for them to do so. This is the beauty of a system that can thrive and grow and adapt by figuring out what needs to be regulated as time goes on.

Wow, this guy is clueless.

Bitcoin is TRUSTLESS. It doesn't require trust at all. (And it's instantaneous. And it's a tiny fraction of the cost of using Western Union.)

The real risk here isn't even so much a double spend. If the customer sends a small Bitcoin transaction with $0 transaction fees, there is a great chance that the transaction might NEVER be confirmed, and the transaction will be removed from the "pending blocks" in 4-7 days.

My suggestion is that for this tipping Tuesday, we tip some of the porn stars affected by bank account shutdowns, such as Teagan Presley: 
If Bitcoin becomes popular within the porn industry, it will definitely help make Bitcoin go more mainstream. The porn industry has a history of embracing new technologies quickly (VHS, CD-ROMs, Internet, Blu-Ray) and then the people follow.
But now, it is clear that they NEED to embrace the new technology of Bitcoin just to allow them their freedom to work!
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:29:26
I'm not sure if this is accurate, because it’s not currently letting me do so… either from my iOS app (BitWallet) nor my MultiBit app (OS X).
I imported the private key from BitWallet to MultiBit, so I have access to the same funds from both apps… and I'm having the same problem with both apps. They have both deducted the unconfirmed transaction from my balance which I'm allowed to spend from.

Wrong. Apple empowers &amp; delights multiple generations of people with amazing &amp; magical &amp; high-quality products that simply work. Almost every technological innovation ever created that is now mainstream is thanks to Apple bringing it to the masses. Everything from the GUI, the mouse, the laptop, the MP3 player, the smartphone, the multi-touch touchscreen, the tablet, the UNIX operating system, and sooo much more. I'm just scratching the surface here. I didn't even get into their virus-free operating systems, their error-free operating systems, their excellent integration of software &amp; hardware, their award-winning customer support, and so much more. Pay some respect to the companies which have enabled your life to have some meaning. Meanwhile, you're comparing Apple to McDonald's? McDonald's destroys people's health, destroys the planet, and creates the lowest-quality products on planet earth... products which cannot even be categorized as food because they are primarily comprised of cancer-causing chemicals.

I really do hope that Bitcoin eclipses credit cards some day. And believe me, I love having my money in Bitcoin so inflation doesn't ruin the value of my hard-earned savings. You &amp; me are definitely on the same page. 
However, with the vast majority of Americans in debt, I don't know if any of them COULD use Bitcoin for their purchases instead of credit cards. Why? Because most Americans that I know are using credit cards BECAUSE of the fact that they don't have enough money in their checking account to pay for their purchases. They NEED the credit extended to them.

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Having said that, it's a great strategy to invest in things that you personally believe will have a bright future... ESPECIALLY at a time when others are skeptical of it, because that usually means that it's undervalued in price at the time.

The answer to this particular question is "fungibility". Each ounce of gold is identical in quality, whereas each ounce of diamonds could be of wildly different quality.

I agree that the VAST MAJORITY of people are pigs and idiots. There is no questioning this at all. However, if you truly believe in the potential of Bitcoin, the better option (instead of walking away from it) is to take ACTION IN YOUR LIFE to make Bitcoin more relevant &amp; more valuable across the world. It's not up to "them" to make Bitcoin more relevant, it's up to all of us.
For example, in my own life, my business gives a discount for people paying in Bitcoin, I give speeches regarding Bitcoin, I make videos regarding Bitcoin, I pay a few of my vendors in Bitcoin, and I ask all merchants that I do business with if they will accept Bitcoin.
You can educate, create a Bitcoin startup business, help influence the usage of Bitcoin, etc.
And, currency is just the first app of the Bitcoin network!

Coinbase is totally 100% safe and legit, but all of your Bitcoin transactions will be permanently traceable back to you. There is zero privacy nor anonymity. And since the Blockchain is public, they (along with all branches of the U.S. Government) can track all of your Bitcoin transactions forever. Which is the exact same problem we currently have with credit cards and bank accounts.

Very true. They are inextricably tied together, which is very exciting from a technology standpoint. I think what I meant is that people are too focused on the PRICE of the currency, and people are too focused on using Bitcoin to PURCHASE goods &amp; services. When in reality, even if each Bitcoin was only worth $10 and people weren't using it for purchasing goods &amp; services, the Blockchain would still be able to provide so many things: smart contracts, proof of existence services, copyright services, notary public services, proof of registrations &amp; titles, fair &amp; easily-auditable elections, honest ticket selling services, and so much more that I'm not even thinking of. "The Internet of Things" also seems like it will be able to benefit greatly from the Blockchain.

It's people's own faults for storing their private keys with third parties that they know nothing about. If people did even 10 minutes of Bitcoin research ahead of time, they would know to never keep their private keys online with an exchange. (That's like handing over your real-life wallet to a homeless guy on the street, and then coming back a few months later to get your cash. You shouldn't be surprised if your cash is gone, as well as the homeless guy!) The only trustworthy places where you can store your money online is with a website that supports multi-signature keys like bitgo.com, or a website like blockchain.info that never stores your private keys at all. Otherwise, keep the private keys encrypted on your own hard drive and make backups of your encrypted private keys.

Isn't it quaint, in this day &amp; age, to see a country trying to create a new national currency from scratch? Bitcoin has opened my eyes to the fact that a global currency, unencumbered by borders or boundaries or any particular nation state, is the ONLY solution for an increasingly global world. Could you imagine if each country had a different email protocol for sending &amp; receiving email? This shows how antiquated the idea of a non-global currency is at this point.

Here we go again. You speak as if the regulators have any modicum of sanity, and that they don't exist only to protect the status quo and the entrenched/established monopolies. Even then, those established players don't have to follow the regulations themselves... they just get a little slap on the wrist if they disobey, showing that the regulations exist simply to stop competition. Take a look at the BitLicense regulations -- what was it, 26 pages long?? -- and you let me know if there is ANYTHING in there that allows for ANY sort of personal freedoms, technological innovations, or allows for a competitive landscape to the current criminal banking cartel. Technology can produce better consumer protection solutions than regulations, such as CoinBase's excellent implementation of multi-sig.  Any regulations, if they arrive, should be delayed until the Bitcoin industry is more mature and we can all UNDERSTAND exactly what regulations need to be in place. If the regulators tried to implement a "NetLicense" when the Internet first started, we wouldn't have the World Wide Web that we have today.

 For all we know, Ghash.io might ALREADY control 51% of the network. There is a huge 21% "Unknown" on that chart, which might be controlled by Ghash.

The entire world -- and perhaps this entire subreddit -- is way too focused on Bitcoin as a currency. Bitcoin is not a very good currency at the moment, but that doesn't matter because the TRUE INNOVATION of Bitcoin is the Blockchain. What the Blockchain provides to the world is absolutely amazing, has UNLIMITED uses, and can affect everybody in various ways in their daily lives. It goes waaaaay beyond just being a currency. This video does a great job of introducing people to the benefits of the Blockchain, but even this video just scratches the surface of what is truly possible:

1. T-Mobile doesn't have contracts.
2. How does any carrier enforce payments? All they have is a credit card number on file for your recurring payments. If your credit card expires or the number changes, it's up to you to notify the carrier of your new credit card information so they can continue billing you. If you don't and they can't collect payment from you, then they would take legal recourse against you, because they have your social security number on file so they should know how to find you.

The recipient can rebroadcast by adding in a fee? Is there a specific wallet software that allows this? I was demonstrating Bitcoin to my friend by sending him $2 with no transaction fee, but it never confirmed. I couldn't rebroadcast nor cancel...

Yet all of those things are already covered by already-existing laws/regulations. In other words, we don't need new &amp; draconian regulations just because we're paying in Bitcoin. For example, if you sell mining hardware but don't deliver to your customers after they pay you, that is always fraud... regardless of whether you paid with Bitcoin or not.

Fees are not 100% optional. They are required under many different circumstances, including small transaction amounts (like $1 - $5).

Typical misleading reporting by the Wall Street Journal. The author mentions in the first paragraph that Bitcoin transactions are not as fast or risk-free as people suggest, yet he completely fails to mention that credit card transactions can be reversed (i.e. charged back) MONTHS after the purchase is made. Meanwhile, all successful Bitcoin transactions are permanently irreversible. So the comparison should really be 10 minutes vs. several months. (Not to mention people who are using bank transfers to move money around, which can take 4 business days to go through.)

Mt. Gox wasn't really using the blockchain. Karpeles was primarily doing off-chain transactions &amp; acting like a fractional reserve bank (i.e. a Ponzi scheme) to sell Bitcoins that he didn't even have to begin with. Many Bitcoins existed, but many of them did not. The ones that DID exist, Karpeles probably stole and they can be tracked via the Blockchain.
This is why -- similar to gold -- you only truly own the Bitcoins that you hold the private keys to.

What is the logic behind this? Why would any "normal person" (i.e. not you or me) convert USD to BTC, simply to buy something on Overstock? Makes no logical sense at all. They would simply use a credit card to make their purchase. Much easier and quicker and cheaper than paying a high conversion fee to Coinbase or LocalBitcoins.com to convert their USD to BTC, then watching their BTC swing wildly in value! And with Coinbase, they'd have to wait 4-7 business days for their BTC to arrive anyways! The solution to all of this? Pay with a credit card.

It seems like any government regulations regarding Bitcoin are designed with one purpose in mind only: protecting the "Too Big To Fail" banks. It has nothing at all to do with protecting the people. Technological innovations &amp; the free market are what protect the people, such as the multisig protocol and Coinbase's recent addition of super-easy-to-use multisig wallets on their site. How can we get government to be HANDS OFF with this empowering new technology of Bitcoin and the Blockchain, so that it may be encouraged to thrive and innovate? Another example: government doesn't even understand that the Blockchain can be used for so much more than just currency.

When thinking about retail transactions via Coinbase, the merchants have all the advantages with Bitcoin right now: they are shielded from volatility, there are no credit card transaction fees, there are no chargebacks, they receive instant payments. But consumers have no advantages over their fiat credit cards: they have no dispute capabilities, no ability to earn frequent flyer miles, they are responsible for paying the miner's fees, they have to pay 1% to buy their Bitcoins, they have to wait 4 business days for their Bitcoins to arrive, they have to reveal all their private information to the U.S. Government via Coinbase, and they are not shielded from any of the volatility.

Awww, cute but sad message! :( Of course, the opposite could also come true for your daughter in a few months: her Bitcoin balance could rise above $10. Then she'll be happy!
Depending on how old she is, I suppose you could frame the discussion with her as a lesson in long-term investing. For example, if I had sold all my Apple stock when it dropped 50% in one day, I would not have been able to profit from it when it started rising again.
But this doesn't really help her much if she just really needs $10 to purchase something at the store. Probably the best solution is that you should go back to giving her allowance in US Dollars.
Yes, you might be able to explain to her that with U.S. Dollars in a bank account, the value will always go in one direction only: DOWN, due to inflation (rising prices &amp; decreased purchasing power). But that might be too abstract, and doesn't really help the situation either.
Bitcoin is a long-term play. But your daughter needs short-term income to purchase stuff.

That was a pretty well-written paper, even though it was almost 100% negative about Bitcoin. It was even negative on using Bitcoin for remittances, which is widely considered to be one of the best uses for Bitcoin. Of course, academia is part of the status quo, and they are totally supportive of Keynesian Economics and The Federal Reserve... so it probably shouldn't surprise me that their paper would be totally down on Bitcoin.
Although they did have a few valid concerns:
I was concerned that they said that Bitcoin's adoption growth has been absolutely glacial... especially when compared to a service like M-Pesa. In the same amount of years, Bitcoin's growth has only seen 5% of M-Pesa's growth.
Also, this paragraph in particular stood out to me, because this is why I think Bitcoin is going to have a difficult time catching on with consumers: "It is less clear that consumers benefit from paying by bitcoin. Many credit cards provide consumers with rebates, widely 1% but sometimes 2% or even more, and well as similar benefits such as frequent flyer points and merchandise credits. If a consumer pays by Bitcoin rather than credit card, the consumer foregoes these benefits—paying the same gross price (the retailer’s standard price for the chosen items) but losing the rebate or bonus. Edelman 2014 points out that the lack of benefits makes Bitcoin a poor value for many consumers: Even if a consumer already has Bitcoin, the consumer would be better off making a purchase with a 1.5% cashback credit card, paying a 1% fee to convert Bitcoins to dollars, then using those dollars to pay the credit card bill—a procedure that yields a 0.5% cost savings compared to paying the merchant directly. If the consumer was going to incur a 1% fee to convert dollars to Bitcoin in the first place, the benefits of Bitcoin grow even more distant."

Always remember RULE  never trust Coinbase. They use off-chain transactions, they have numerous bugs with their website (e.g. they double-sent all my Bitcoin transactions from my account last week... luckily, I knew the recipient and got them sent back to me), and now they are acting irresponsible, dangerous, and foolish to allow another entity to completely control an app with their BRANDING on it.

Haha! That task may be a few years in the making! ;) Although that was how I bought my first Bitcoins at my local gold shop. We both fired up the Bitcoin QT Wallet, I handed him cash + emailed him my public address, and he sent me Bitcoins from his laptop via Bitcoin QT.

Great point. I agree that the vast majority of ChangeTip users probably never cash out, because they want to have a balance immediately ready &amp; immediately on-hand for tipping. ChangeTip operating as a fractional reserve bank would be another potentially dangerous thing for the Bitcoin community.

Lol!! You're still waiting for evidence, when this entire thread is filled with evidence, and there have been countless books/documentaries written on the topic? Oh, that's right, you've already mentioned elsewhere in this thread that you refuse to read or view anything that doesn't agree with your predefined beliefs. Well, that defines you as BOTH a troll AND a closed-minded human. Congratulations!
If you're so convinced that you aren't a troll, why don't you try stepping up to the plate with some of YOUR EVIDENCE that the dollar ISN'T falling apart? You haven't done so, because it's an impossible position to take.
And here's a little tip for you: your bachelors in education doesn't mean shit. And I'm not even considering the fact that the Federal Reserve specifically created all the economics courses in America (as proved in the book The Creature From Jekyll Island). What I'm considering is the fact that the only thing your bachelors degree shows is that you have been molded into a state approved homogenous drone that cannot think outside of the prescribed consensus, and that you have learned to repeat information instead of think for yourself so that you don't become a threat to the status quo. You do nothing but perpetuate the corporate system of indentured servitude, and do zero self-education. Way to leave a lasting legacy on humanity!

The Bitcoin Foundation has always been a complete sham and has always been one of the most untrustworthy entities in the entire Bitcoin community (e.g. they were still promoting Mt. Gox on their website after Mt. Gox ran off with everybody's money!). But now, with Brock Pierce trying to pin Bitcoin to the U.S. Dollar, we can see that the Bitcoin Foundation (and Brock Pierce) are actually just criminally insane people. The entire point of Bitcoin is to give us a currency that is FAR SUPERIOR and FAR MORE TRUSTWORTHY than the U.S. Dollar… one that doesn't DECAY IN VALUE over time.

First, people being introduced to Bitcoin via ChangeTip for the first time don't know about wallets, so they are likely to keep all their tips on ChangeTip... if only for the convenience of tipping others. Secondly, if a million users each stored only $15 on ChangeTip, and ChangeTip ran off with everybody's money, that would be a $15 million theft. And there would be a ton of negative publicity from both the press and the million people who each had $15 stolen from them.

Perhaps. Or, Bitcoin could be tanking for the same reason that gold is tanking. With the Fed's Quantitative Easing 3 in full force, and the Fed printing $85 BILLION every single month, the stock market is (temporarily) going sky high and people are (temporarily) having incredible complacency &amp;amp; faith in the U.S. Dollar. So the masses feel like there's not even any reason to look at sound money like gold and Bitcoin, since it seems like the US Dollar can do no wrong and the stock market can do no wrong. But people are going to be in for a real shock when this House of Cards starts to collapse. The ultra-wealthy already know what's coming around the corner... they're investing in gold (and probably Bitcoin as well, I would assume):

CoinDesk is actually an outstanding news source that has done more to enlighten &amp; educate people about Bitcoin than any other news source out there.

Mt. Gox was not Bitcoin. They were a centralized company that held people's private keys to their bitcoins. Yet most of the proposed regulations in America would not even protect another Mt. Gox from happening... most of the regulations entail recording a person's private information (into a centralized database which could be hacked) whenever that person makes even the smallest private transaction with Bitcoin -- such as buying a cup of coffee or tipping someone 20 cents. This is way more onerous and restrictive and oppressive than paying in cash.

That's true. And it requires even more trust than traditional banking. Which is why people typically recommend only keeping a small amount of money in these centralized, off-chain services. For example, I only keep less than $20 in my ChangeTip account, so if they steal my bitcoins, I'll be upset but it won't ruin my life.

They are [expecting between $10 to $20 million in Bitcoin sales this year.]( Taking the average of those two numbers is $15 million, which is actually $1.25 million per month.

The price is dropping because the general public doesn't understand nor get Bitcoin, outside of all the negative nonsense that the mainstream news keeps spewing at them constantly.

Thanks so much for this great information!! I will try this later on today! :) 
One question about this: If I use Multibit to import my private key and then resend the transaction with a fee, how will the blockchain know that I'm trying to "replace/overwrite" the old transaction instead of just creating a brand new transaction? 
In other words, if my original sending address has $20 worth of Bitcoin in it, and I use Multibit to resend $1 from that sending address to my friend's public address, I would love to end up with a $19 balance on my end. But, if my original $1 transaction from my iOS device eventually confirms some day or month or year in the future, then I will potentially end up with $18 as my balance… because BOTH transactions might have gone through.

Any regulation that you try to impose on Bitcoin is going to stifle the most important innovations of the Bitcoin industry, yet force it to continue underground. Nobody in the government even UNDERSTANDS Bitcoin, so how can they attempt to regulate it? If the Internet was attempted to be regulated as much as this when it first started, the Internet never would have succeeded. The best approach is to be HANDS OFF and let the market regulate itself. What you're trying to do is the equivalent of trying to impose regulations on automobiles &amp; highways &amp; gas stations &amp; the entire oil industry when the combustion engine wasn't even finished being built yet. Leave Bitcoin alone. Any time government gets its hands on ANYTHING, it DESTROYS IT FOR THE PEOPLE. Yet ironically, this time around, Bitcoin cannot be destroyed, so just let it be or else it WILL BECOME what you fear. The government has NEVER successfully solved ANY problems… the government only CREATES problems. There is 0% satisfaction from the people about ANYTHING that the government has touched with its hands, so if you really were honestly concerned about the people (which is highly unlikely), then you should leave it alone. Yeah, we get that your job is a "regulator" so you are required to "regulate"… so perhaps you should switch your job to actually HELPING humanity instead of HURTING humanity? Food for thought.

Oh wait a second, Coinbase (and others) have already done all of that. On their own. With no government regulations.

Well, first of all, the societal problem of credit card fraud &amp; identity theft is PRECISELY one of the problems that Bitcoin solves. And secondly, Ross wasn't selling any of those things himself. He created a free marketplace where people could buy &amp; sell whatever they wanted to. All of that stuff was being sold long before Silk Road existed, and will continue to be sold long into the future. Imprisoning Ross doesn't change any of this...it only creates more resilient free marketplaces, like Open Bazaar. Imprisoning Ross would be like imprisoning eBay's president because I got sold fraudulent concert tickets on eBay (which happened to me). Maybe the real solution would be to go after the people who are actually defrauding others, or better yet, solve the problem of why identity theft &amp; credit card theft are so common. Hint: Bitcoin solves these 2 issues.

The price is going down because Overstock.com is selling $1 million dollars worth of Bitcoins per month in exchange for U.S. Dollars. Same with all the other merchants who are now accepting bitcoins. None of them are holding Bitcoins; they're just converting them right back to U.S. Dollars, so they're basically dumping their Bitcoins on the market. Doesn't do Bitcoin much good if merchants aren't holding Bitcoins, which creates a vicious cycle of the price going downwards, and then the merchants REALLY don't want to hold Bitcoins, which causes the price to go even more downwards, which causes the merchants to REALLY not want to hold Bitcoins, etc.

Wrong, wrong, and more wrong. Sorry that your lamestream economics degree won't help you when it comes to Bitcoin. Debt-based deflation is bad, because nobody has money to spend. On the other hand, asset-based deflation -- which is what Bitcoin is -- is good, because everyone is wealthier and has more to spend. The technology hardware industry is an example of asset-based deflation, where we are all effectively wealthier because the cost of electronics have come down.

You don't need a centralized company. All you need is a private key with sufficient bitcoins. But the U.S. Government is trying to regulate the merchants -- e.g. the coffee shops of America -- so that THE MERCHANTS will be fined &amp; imprisoned if they accept bitcoins from you WITHOUT recording all that other information. In other words, the government is trying to "quietly" ban bitcoin by simply making it impossible &amp; unwieldy for any merchants to comply with their regulations. I see this as a race right now between the people and governments -- the people must start embracing bitcoin en masse before the government can start enforcing these draconian laws, so that the people will be outraged when the government tries to crack down on it.

If Bitcoin EVER gets to the point where it is as simple, user-friendly, and advantageous to people's lives as Apple's products, THEN they can start dissing Apple.

I think Bitcoin has EXCELLENT potential for so many different uses... but I have a hard time believing that consumers will ever leave their credit cards behind for Bitcoin, because of the following reasons:
- Credit cards actually let them spend money they don't have.
- They don't have to pay a 1% fee to buy into the credit card payment unit (U.S. Dollars).
- On the contrary, when spending with a credit card, consumers receive up to 3% back in rewards, bonuses, airline miles, shopping points, hotel points, etc.
- Consumers have the ability to dispute a transaction later with credit cards.
I'm not down on Bitcoin's future in general, but I just think that retail transactions will not be the "killer app" for Bitcoin.

Wow, until you posted this, I was still thinking that international wires were the PERFECT use case for Bitcoin.

If you're interested in investing in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation (because of its limited supply), you would probably be much safer &amp;amp; smarter by investing in gold &amp;amp; silver. Not gold &amp;amp; silver ETF's, which are typically scams, but actually buying the actual precious metals themselves and storing them in a vault. There is no guarantee that Bitcoins will be used in the future, but precious metals will never go to zero. They have been used as money for thousands of years. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:26:09
How is this false? For example, I would only pay Square 2.75% to swipe a credit card, even if the charge is only $1. 
However, Bitcoin does have a SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE when the transactions get much larger. When the transactions are larger, Bitcoin's transaction fees are negligible… barely noticeable… close to zero.
But my point was that micro-transactions are currently too expensive.

This is a great point. While Bitcoin may greatly benefit merchants, there are currently no benefits for consumers.

This article is totally wrong. The whole point of Bitcoin is that it is all-inclusive and has close to zero fees.

You are correct. There are ZERO advantages right now (in 2014) for consumers to spend with Bitcoin instead of a credit card. ESPECIALLY if they're getting rewards points for using their credit cards, such as frequent flyer miles or hotel points. The only genuine problem that Bitcoin solves at this stage in the game (in 2014) is sending international person-to-person payments (i.e. someone sending money back home to their family in another country). But as far as retail transactions go, the only real advantage that I can see for a consumer would come from a merchant offering a Bitcoin discount to the customer because the merchant themselves are saving money on the processing fees. This is why, in my opinion, Bitcoin is going to have a real tough time taking off in developed countries like USA. There is simply no major advantage for the consumer right now. However, for the unbanked people of the world, Bitcoin could be great. But in the USA? It's unlikely that we will see broad adoption anytime in the near future. Just makes no sense right now for consumers. Even with a 2% discount, I think people would still rather earn their frequent flyer points and get their fraud protection. On the other hand, as a hedge against inflation, Bitcoin is going to be a great store of value. And Bitcoin can bring peace to the world. So those are 2 pluses.

And most people don't realize that many of the chronic health problems in this country (including multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, peripheral neuropathy, chronic fatigue syndrome, Gulf War Syndrome, Parkinson's Disease, tendon ruptures, and more) are CAUSED by pharmaceutical drugs.

But instead, they are prescribed millions of times per year for minor infections. They are so incredibly devastating to the human body, but since it takes 6 months for the health problems to appear after taking the drugs, neither patients nor doctors are making the connection between the pharmaceutical drug &amp; the chronic health problems.

Even if Amazon accepted Bitcoin, why would people rush to buy Bitcoins? Why would any normal person (i.e. not us, the hardcore fanatics &amp; hardcore Bitcoin supporters) go through the process of converting their fiat currency to Bitcoins, usually with a high percentage commission attached to the conversion process (i.e. Coinbase charges 1%, and people on localbitcoins.com charge even more), only to see the value of their Bitcoins swing wildly up &amp; down every few weeks? For what desired outcome? So they can buy stuff on overstock.com that they could have bought immediately with their credit cards -- but with no fluctuation and with no transaction fees? Except for buying porn that doesn't show up on the wife's credit card bill, normal people see VERY LITTLE value proposition to deal with Bitcoins AT THIS POINT in time. That doesn't mean that it won't change in 10-15 years from now, but at this point, people are primarily avoiding it. All the bad press doesn't help, either. We're still at least 10-15 years away from mainstream Bitcoin adoption (if it ever does go mainstream), and even then, the real revolution may be in OTHER USES of the Blockchain (such as transparent elections), not as a currency.

Yes, the BTC price will be calculated depending on the dollar price at the time of the payment.

So when my incoming payment is received by Coinbase, I have the option of turning some of it into fiat if I need to. Although my goal is to keep 100% of my incoming BTC payments in Bitcoin! :)

Two suggestions for the Bitcoin Obituaries site:
1. Can you please add the authors' names, so we can ridicule those people later? :)
2. When Bitcoin goes mainstream, many of these websites may delete their earlier articles where they criticized Bitcoin. It would be great to still be able to read these articles online. Please see if you can cache copies of those articles using a free online caching service... there was one that I forgot the name of. The Internet Archive Wayback Machine at archive.org IS NOT good enough for caching purposes, because they will respond to website owners' requests to delete all caches from their records. For example, the crisisactors.org website, which hires actors to create false flag terror events all around the United States, pulled down their website to hide from public scrutiny... and then they contacted archive.org to go back in time and delete ALL of their archives going back many years.

Regarding the implementation of this into my invoicing process:
Currently, it's a tiny bit of a hassle because I want to use a unique bitcoin address for each invoice. I create my invoices using FileMaker Pro, so I needed a FileMaker-friendly way of doing this. 
I know that FileMaker's random number generator isn't truly random enough to create secure Bitcoin addresses, so I decided to depend on the Coinbase website to manually create each new deposit address for me. I manually go to the "Tools -&gt; Bitcoin Addresses" portion of Coinbase's website, and click on the "Create New Address" button. Then, I copy-and-paste the new Bitcoin address from Coinbase into a "Bitcoin Address" text field that I created in FileMaker.
Once I have the Bitcoin address pasted into the text field in FileMaker, the QR code is automatically &amp; instantly generated by FileMaker because I programmed Google's Chart API into my invoicing system to create the QR Code. I discovered how to do this by reading this blog article:  
There is also a different way to create the QR Code in FileMaker using JavaScript (instead of Google's API) as well: 
I have a feeling that in the future, other small businesses who are using FileMaker may also want to embed unique Bitcoin addresses onto each one of their invoices, so I want to make this same process much easier for them in the future. So I am working on creating a Bitcoin FileMaker Plug-In which uses the Coinbase API to automatically generate Bitcoin addresses for people DIRECTLY within their FileMaker systems -- without them needing to leave their FileMaker system to go to a website, manually log into that website, click on a few buttons, then copy-and-paste addresses. The plug-in will enable this to all be done instantly &amp; immediately within FileMaker.
Regarding the exchange rate:
Yes, I am the "go-to tech guy" for my clients, so I will be personally guiding them on which Bitcoin wallets to use... and I will guide them towards wallets that will automatically do the USD to BTC conversion for them (such as Coinbase or BreadWallet).

I am generating one unique bitcoin address per invoice. So when payment is received for a particular bitcoin address, I can search my invoicing system for that unique bitcoin address to mark that invoice as paid.
Also, all of my bitcoin addresses are being generated by Coinbase, so whenever I receive payment, I will automatically receive an email from Coinbase to alert me to the new activity. This will prevent me from having to constantly &amp; manually check for incoming payments every day. 
I have even gone one step further by adding a "label" to each bitcoin address on the Coinbase website. This "label" is the related invoice # from my invoicing system. So whenever I get paid, I can choose to log into the Coinbase website to see exactly which invoice # was just paid.

To be fair, all currencies depreciate in purchasing power while they are still inflating. Yet Bitcoin is the only currency we know of where the rate of inflation actually slows down every 4 years and then stops altogether. Even better, the purchasing power will increase as demand for it increases, because even during its inflationary stages, the supply is fixed &amp; predictable.
EDIT: This was in reply to a now-deleted troll post about how Bitcoin's price keeps dropping.

You need to research what your taxes go towards. The IRS started collecting personal income tax in 1913, the same year the Federal Reserve was created. Why? To pay back the interest due on the money printed by the Fed. The vast majority of our taxes go towards paying the debt to the Fed, plus to bomb innocent civilians in countries who don't agree with our policies. War &amp; interest. Of course, since the whole Fed is one big Ponzi scheme, the debt can never be fully paid back.

I don't think you understand the devastating effect of even the slightest amount of inflation on a person's ability to save nor provide for their future. If you require $75,000 per year for your expenses today, in 40 years, you will need about $300,000 per year to have the EXACT SAME purchasing power as you do today. All due to inflation. But inflation is NOT a natural phenomenon like gravity, or water freezing at a certain temperature. Inflation is caused 100% by the central banks creating money out of thin air. They are stealing our purchasing power by giving it to themselves and others... all by continuously expanding our currency with no restraint. The banks do this with fractional reserve banking, and the Fed does this by "printing" more money for the government.

I do not figure out the exchange rate ahead of time, because it could be a few weeks before my clients pay their invoices. I will be guiding them on using Bitcoin wallets (such as Coinbase or BreadWallet) that will automatically convert the USD to BTC exchange rate for them at the time of payment. I have a close relationship with all of my clients, and they hire me for both FileMaker Pro database development &amp; Apple technical support... in other words, I am their "go-to tech guy". So they will most likely be asking me directly to help guide them in getting setup with Bitcoin. I'll be sure to guide them towards wallets that will instantly do the USD/BTC conversion for them.

Excellent point!! This happens in all facets of society, which is why we have a government that is wildly out of control. Just one random example from society to reiterate your point: people also think that pharmaceutical drugs are safe because the FDA will protect them from harm. When, in actuality, quite the opposite is true. Many pharmaceutical drugs are very harmful, but by law according to the U.S. Supreme Court, pharmaceutical companies can not be held liable for any human damage that they cause. It is not a free market nor a safe market when companies can not be held responsible, and dangerous antibiotics like Cipro &amp; Levaquin are prescribed millions of times per year which cause LONG TERM PERMANENT damage to people:

I will accept credit cards (via the Square iOS app) if my client requests to pay via credit card. Strangely enough, though, I have only had 4 out of my 200 clients ask to pay via credit card.

Not yet, because using those API calls is beyond my technical knowledge. 
Currently, I am manually logging into the Coinbase website, manually creating new bitcoin addresses there, and then manually copying-and-pasting each bitcoin address into an invoice within my FileMaker invoicing system. 
However, I am working with a programmer to help me automate this process. I am working with him to develop a Bitcoin plug-in for FileMaker, which would enable FileMaker to make use of Coinbase's wallet management features via API calls.

Yes, I use FileMaker to create the invoices. It's a little bit of a manual hassle/process right now, because I want to have a unique Bitcoin address on each invoice, and FileMaker's random number generator is NOT random enough to create truly-secure Bitcoin addresses.
So currently, I'm using the Coinbase website to manually create each new Bitcoin address for me.  Then, I copy-and-paste each Bitcoin address from the Coinbase website into each FileMaker invoice. 
Once the Bitcoin address is pasted into the invoice, creating the QR code is the easy part, and is completely automated. I found 2 blog articles which describe how to generate QR codes in FileMaker... I'm using the Google Charts method right now:
Google Charts method: 
JavaScript method: 
However, the good news is that I am working on creating a Bitcoin plug-in for FileMaker, so that nobody who uses FileMaker will ever have to jump through this many hoops in the future. My vision is that this will be super easy for people in the future: right from within FileMaker, they'll be able to press a button which grabs their next Bitcoin address from Coinbase, Bitpay, etc. (whichever API's I add into the plug-in), and right from within FileMaker, the QR code will be generated without them having to know anything about programming.

Wrong. Inflation by a central bank is theft, plain and simple. You've bought into the lies that the Federal Reserve tells. The idea that people spend more when they have less is ludicrous. People spend more when they have more to spend. Obviously. The other thing you're talking about isn't inflation, it's called supply &amp; demand.

Yes, very true that the doctors are ultimately at fault! Although it is a symbiotic relationship between the pharma companies marketing to doctors, and doctors not questioning what they are being marketed. John Oliver actually did a funny bit about this here: [Marketing To Doctors](
Regarding the frivolous lawsuits, these are misconceptions that are successfully perpetuated by the medical industry through the mainstream media. For example, generic drug manufacturers can never be sued at all, even in class action lawsuits. So any class action lawsuits are targeting the brand name version of the drug. But the generic versions get off completely scot-free, even if they cause harm: [Supreme Court Rules Drug Companies Exempt From Lawsuits]( In fact, there's a pretty decent documentary entitled [Hot Coffee]( which dispels the myths of these frivolous lawsuits, and they spend most of the movie talking about how these tort reform laws hurt the little guy.
As far as suing a doctor is concerned, it is practically impossible to sue a doctor in the state of Texas, which is where strong tort reform laws are currently in place... even if the doctor was medically negligent. This is why there are practically no medical malpractice lawyers left in the state of Texas. The laws are completely stacked in favor of the medical industry &amp; the doctors, even the ones who are doing harm. I don't have a specific link to give you, but I speak from personal experience. I was partially disabled by provable medical negligence, but after 2 years of talking to more than a dozen lawyers, they all said that their hands were completely tied -- even though we had documented proof of medical negligence -- because we are in Texas.

This is very exciting news!! Question: Can you please explain what would happen if somebody loses their original land title document? Even though it is hashed into the blockchain, it can't be unhashed out of the blockchain. From what I understand, the original document must still be kept in untampered form somewhere, because you can only verify that it is still in the blockchain by taking the original/untampered document, hashing it again, and then matching the resulting hash with the blockchain to prove that the same exact hash exists in the blockchain. Correct? If so, then what happens if the person loses their original document... they are completely out of luck, right?

I just tried tipping an artist 2 beers ($7.00), but the ChangeTip robot replied publicly on the SoundCloud thread that I had only tipped the artist 1 beer ($3.50). Then, when I logged into ChangeTip.com, the CORRECT amount (2 beers or $7.00) was actually deducted from my ChangeTip account, even though the ChangeTip robot told the artist that I only gave him 1 beer ($3.50). I have now canceled my tip because it wasn't working properly. But you can see the errant ChangeTip robot message, which still remains online:

The more dangerous drugs are primarily dangerous BECAUSE they are illegal. There is no quality control nor dosage control, and people can't seek help for their addictions without being thrown in jail. Plus, because the drugs are illegal, violence is involved in bringing these drugs to the adults who desire to use them. Ending prohibition would end all of these problems. Alcohol is, by far, one of the most dangerous drugs, but alcohol prohibition didn't end because people stopped drinking. This is a health problem, not a criminal problem.

Very interesting about the drug war being born out of classism and racism! That would not surprise me!
However, the pharmaceutical drug companies are not truly heavily regulated. Similar to how the banks are not truly heavily regulated. In both cases, these industries own the regulators and pay big lobbying bucks to write the laws in their favors. And the result? We get laws like this: [Supreme Court Rules Drug Companies Exempt From Lawsuits]( (Similarly, the banks wrote the Dodd-Frank Act in their favor, which enables them to do bail-ins.) Also, the drug companies pay the FDA to approve their drugs, but the FDA does zero safety testing of their own. The FDA simply reads through the Word document that the drug companies send over, and take them at face value. As the former pharmaceutical executive John Virapin wrote in his whistleblowing book "[Side Effects: Death]( these Word documents are typically completely fabricated. Totally fictionalized.

This site will let you create secure paper wallets: 
Create 50 paper wallets, print them out, and then send $1 to each wallet.
Since you will know the private key of each wallet (enabling you to spend the $1 on each wallet), your students should "sweep" (NOT import) the wallet into their own wallet app, so they can be in full control of their funds.
"Sweeping" is different than "importing". Sweeping moves the funds to a new address that they control. Importing just gives them the same private key that you already know.
Many wallet apps offer this "sweep" capability. I believe that the cross-platform [AirBitz]( wallet has this capability.
Also, on YouTube, check out the [World Bitcoin Network] ( channel. James D'Angelo has a few tutorials on using the BitAddress.org website.
And, I like this 20-minute introductory video, which might be at a basic-enough level for your students: 
(EDIT: Airbitz does sweep private keys, but they call it an "import" within the app.)

No worries. If Peter ruins Bitcoin for the rest of us, my feeling is that we can all switch to an alt coin and leave Peter all alone to play with Bitcoin. The [Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast where Peter Todd speaks about his beliefs]( is more than enough to make me question all of his motives.

You're slightly misunderstanding. Coinbase is basically identical to PayPal and Square. They will -- and have in the past -- seized thousands of dollars from users who do something that they don't like. Coinbase and the U.S. Government are in full control of a user's funds when they sit with Coinbase. You could potentially buy Bitcoins from Coinbase, but then immediately transfer the Bitcoins to a mobile wallet like Airbitz, which can't seize your funds. (Of course, the other problem with Coinbase is that they continue to track your Bitcoins even after you transfer them away from Coinbase, so a truly ideal situation would be to purchase elsewhere.)

There can be a huge difference between wallets. Ideally, you want a wallet where only you hold the private keys (so your money can't get stolen by the wallet creators), and a wallet which is deterministic (so you can recover your funds on another device using a seed phrase). Bitcoin.org has a nice breakdown of the best wallets. My 2 favorite wallets for iOS are AirBitz &amp; BreadWallet. My 2 favorite wallets for Android are AirBitz &amp; Mycelium. My 2 favorite desktop wallets are Electrum HD &amp; Armory. But there are other wallets as well!

We probably can't have an UNLIMITED block size limit at this point in time, but we definitely need a MUCH BIGGER block size limit (and one which will keep growing over time). 
Removing the block size limit would ultimately help Bitcoin thrive, not die. And it would thrive in a completely decentralized way that gives the whole world direct access to the blockchain to make low-cost transactions, without having to depend on centralized/custodial services. 
Gavin talks about it more in this podcast:

HUH? Downloading a wallet takes 30 seconds and you're ready to go immediately. With BitPay and Coinbase, you have to reveal all your personal information, wait a week for your bank account to be linked to it, and then you get to be censored and tracked afterwards!

I think you should list AirBitz, the one wallet which is cross-platform, open source, lets the users control their private keys, and is non-SPV (since the SPV wallets like BreadWallet and Bitcoin Wallet are potentially problematic at the moment).
More importantly, AirBitz gives users a built-in local directory of Bitcoin-accepting merchants &amp; ATM machines, which is perfect for newbies who are wondering where they can spend their Bitcoins or who accepts Bitcoins. The built-in directory really helps newbies to become an active participant in the growing Bitcoin ecosystem.

Um, because only government can provide a monopoly on protection?? I don't think so. Here's a good article that explains a better way: 
@_date: 2015-08-15 01:28:41
Actually, AirBitz never sees this information. It is all encrypted locally on your device before it is sent to their servers. They don't have the ability to see the metadata that you typed into their wallet. Their code is also open source, so you can verify this for yourself by looking through their programming code.
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:45:06
Check out [BitRated]( This is a great way to make Bitcoin purchases which protect the consumer (and the merchant). Of course, you would have to ask the merchant to use BitRated for your transaction as well.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:27:17
Ha, well there's only 2 real choices for iOS (where users control their own keys, and the projects are open source): AirBitz and BreadWallet. I actually like them both for different reasons! I have them both and I use them both! But one of the reasons I really love AirBitz is because of that built-in directory that gets newbies excited and gets them immediately plunged into the local Butcoin ecosystem. To me, this is very important. Plus, the sound effects in AirBitz make newbies giggle with delight as well. 
Wow, that sounds like an incredible idea to run my own server to augment the AirBitz and OpenBazaar federated network! I would love to do that, but I don't think I have the skills nor the hardware resources to do such a thing. :(  My only technical skill is writing FileMaker databases, which I do from my lone MacBook Pro.
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:37:20
As long as the block size is increased, which would enable all Bitcoin users to transact their transactions on-chain instead of using these centralized/censored/custodial off-chain services, then YES: this is precisely the kind of crap that Bitcoin is supposed to free us from. It probably doesn't help matters that Coin Cafe is located in New York, the most Bitcoin-hostile state in America.
@_date: 2015-07-03 09:01:59
Localbitcoins.com is probably your best bet. But be careful that you don't get scammed. Also, there might be a gold shop in your area that might sell Bitcoins for cash.

@_date: 2015-07-04 03:15:26
Breadwallet is fantastic too, and I have both apps on my iPhone. But there are several ways in which I feel AirBitz really shines. It is a fully-featured wallet with a built-in local directory. The directory is perfect for anybody (especially newbies) who has ever wondered "Where can I spend my Bitcoins in this city?" It makes the Bitcoin wallet experience feel complete. AirBitz also lets you categorize &amp; tag transactions, just like a real checkbook program such as Quicken... and this information is encrypted and then synced to your other devices. Also, whereas Breadwallet has a very minimalist interface with little customizability (which is totally fine for many people), I appreciate AirBitz's customizability. For example, I can choose what bitcoin denomination I want to use (I prefer millibits) and which exchange to pull rates from. But I think that since both Breadwallet and AirBitz lets users control their own keys, and since both apps are open source, people can't go wrong with either app. 
EDIT: As we learned [this morning]( SPV wallets such as BreadWallet are not currently recommended for security reasons, and only wallets that depend on full nodes like AirBitz should be used.

Some wallets let you type in the name of who your transactions went to. And AirBitz goes several steps further: it lets you name, categorize, &amp; add notes to transactions... and then synchronize all of this metadata across devices. It's almost like a "mini-Quicken". I wonder if it has an export function, to export data to other financial programs... I haven't checked for that yet.

Investing requires you to put your dollar at risk. Your dollar MIGHT be worth more tomorrow, or it might be worth significantly less tomorrow. But if you just hold onto your dollar, inflation is the hidden tax that ensures it will be worth significantly less every year, because it will have SIGNIFICANTLY less purchasing power every year. This is because all banks are allowed to print money out of thin air with absolutely nothing backing them, so they devalue all the existing dollars whenever they print more of them. If common people want to get ahead financially, inflation requires people to be spenders and/or risky investors, instead of savers. Bitcoin solves this problem because it is a deflationary currency. Only 21 million bitcoins will exist, so people can become savers again. Mike Maloney's [Hidden Secrets Of Money]( 5-part video series does a great job of explaining all of this in more detail. And the book [The Creature From Jekyll Island]( does a great job as well.

I was under the impression that every time they closed an account, they seized the funds too. If they haven't done that in the past, then that is pretty accommodating of them. But at any point in the future, they certainly could (and probably will) seize funds. As registered money service agents of the U.S. Government, they will (sooner or later) be forced to seize funds.
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:19:53
Oh yes, there could be a Mt Gox style ripoff too... I forgot about that danger as well.
Although banks do seize funds regularly. For example, PayPal just [seized funds from torrent software developers]( and this convenience store owner [had his life savings of $107,000 seized from him](

There can never be a fair trial, because the government runs all the trials in favor of themselves: 
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:53:44
If you think that only government can provide that sort of protection, and that government is somehow the ideal form of protection for consumers, then you are sadly mistaken.
Government exists to steal &amp; to plunder &amp; to keep the establishment entrenched. They don't care about your security nor privacy nor protection. If they did, they wouldn't be trying to force Apple to remove encryption from all of their iPhones.
Meanwhile, the free market will always innovate to come up with the TRULY IDEAL WAYS to protect the consumer. 
Just as one small example, the Bitcoin protocol has built-in protections such as multi-sig wallets, which Coinbase and many others offer on their websites for the ultimate consumer protection. And speaking of Coinbase, they even have insurance that fully protects 100% of their hot wallets. No government regulator required them to adopt either of these protections, but Coinbase knows that both of these decisions made good business sense. 
The failure of Mt. Gox enabled the Bitcoin industry to -- very early on -- learn and grow from its mistakes, which makes everyone safer &amp; stronger &amp; more secure in the long run. You know what isn't safer &amp; stronger &amp; more secure? Whenever something is "TOO BIG TO FAIL". And if you think that you are going to get your money back after your FDIC-insured bank collapses, you better start reading the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. It allows for "bail ins" of YOUR MONEY to fund all of the collapsed bank's losses, all before your FDIC "insurance" ever kicks in. For an example of how this works, refer to Cyprus. 
Not to mention that regulating Bitcoin now would be like regulating the Internet when it was just newsgroups and email. New York State doesn't even understand the true power of the blockchain (outside of the fact that it threatens their corrupt banking sector).
And meanwhile, the entire beauty of Bitcoin is not a single person using Bitcoin needs to trust centralized entities at all. You are your own bank with Bitcoin. Perhaps you forgot about the title of Satoshi's white paper, "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".
Satoshi didn't call it "Bitcoin: A Centralized Electronic Cash System Where Your Funds Are Controlled By Others".

I'm not 100% sure I understand how this works. The data that goes into the blockchain is simply a hash of the original document. So the original document would STILL need to be safeguarded in real life somewhere to prove that it matches the hash in the blockchain, correct? If the original document gets lost or misplaced, what good would the hash be? That question probably sounded snarky, but it's really not -- I'm just trying to wrap my head around how this exciting new functionality works! :)

The Dodd Frank Act of 2010 supersedes the FDIC. Banks can be "bailed in" by confiscating their customer's funds (like the banks did in Cyprus) BEFORE the FDIC insurance kicks in to protect the rest of the customers' funds, if any funds still remain after the bail-in. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:50:55

Merchants don't get variable rates based on the amount of the sale. They get one rate -- whichever rate the merchant processing company offered the merchant at signup time. And making $1,000 sales does NOT entitle you to negotiate lower rates with Visa nor any other credit card merchant company. If anyone is given the power to negotiate at all, it would be huge companies like Apple.

As Erik Voorhees said the other day, if that was all government did, that wouldn't be a problem. But the % of our taxes that go towards those things are a tiny microscopic fraction of where our tax dollars go. The VAST, OVERWHELMING majority of our tax dollars goes to 2 things: military (violence) &amp; paying back the debt to the Federal Reserve (a debt which can never be repaid).
Plus, my feeling is that private companies could do those things (tap water, schools) better than the government. I know that at least with private companies, I might have the CHANCE of having fluoride-free tap water.

For the credit card companies to take a PERCENTAGE of any transaction is totally unfair, because it's all the same work to VISA... it's just a few electronic digits flying back &amp; forth, no matter the amount.

The current inflationary stage is predictable and predefined, so it can be planned for... which is a positive.
Bitcoin was not really designed to replace credit cards for purchasing products from a merchant, where credit cards have the advantage by giving the consumer a 1.5% bonus in rewards and giving them dispute capability. Bitcoin was created for peer-to-peer transactions, especially those over a large distance. Bitcoin was also created for those who prefer more privacy over credit cards, so your information can't be hacked or stolen. Bitcoin was also designed for the vast majority of the world that has no access to banks nor credit cards.
However, Bitcoin will never reach mass adoption unless the block size limit is increased. Otherwise, we're stuck with only 4 transactions per second worldwide, and that won't cut it.
And very sorry you don't care about freedom, your most important human right which governments around the world are continuously trying to take away from you.

Andreas Antonopolous is the Steve Jobs of Bitcoin. Without him, Bitcoin would not be anywhere as popular as it is today.
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:33:27
That's true, he is not the CEO. But assuming that he still owns the private keys to his coins, my feeling is that he would likely want to perform rational actions that are in the best interest of his own creation succeeding. Sort of like Tim Cook wouldn't just dump all his Apple shares, because it would cause a mass panic. Plus, Satoshi doesn't want to reveal his true identity (at least at this point in time), and if he sells his coins, he is likely to give away his identity. I believe that Satoshi is both rational &amp; patient.

Hi Aaron,
Here is a breadwallet feature request for a "worst case scenario": Let's say that a thief steals my iPhone out of my hands while my iPhone is unlocked. Then they go into breadwallet and try to view my recovery phrase or send money. Without my PIN code, they can't see the recovery phrase nor send money, but breadwallet will enable them to type in the PIN code an unlimited number of times. Since there are only 9,999 options for the PIN code, it is feasible that they could spend a couple of hours and eventually unlock breadwallet with my PIN code. It would be awesome if breadwallet only allowed a maximum number of PIN attempts (such as 10 PIN attempts). Then, if the maximum number of PIN attempts is reached, breadwallet could either reset itself as a brand new wallet or require a restart of the entire iPhone. Ideally, it would reset itself as a brand new wallet.

@_date: 2015-02-21 15:34:27
The beauty of open source software along with a completely transparent ledger system is that all of these issues CAN be addressed &amp; discussed, and all of these issues ARE being addressed and discussed. The Bitcoin Wiki even has a list of all of these problems. As far as I could tell by looking through Tim Swanson's book, he didn't bring up any problems that aren't already known and being discussed. Now, compare that to any closed-source, opaque system such as the banking system and the Federal Reserve system... we can't even begin to DISCUSS the problems, because nobody even has an opportunity of SEEING the problems.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:27:45

Sorry about that. Please report them to Coinbase ASAP, along with the URL, because they are using Coinbase's API to steal people's funds. Notice how, at the Coinbase login page, you were actually asked if you wanted to grant full access to your account to those developers. By you logging in, you were granting permission. Coinbase will need to disable the thieves' ability to use their API, in order to prevent other people from getting their money stolen. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:37:55
Right. It's only a problem if:
1. Your income doesn't keep pace with inflation every year. Most people's incomes don't keep pace with inflation.
 
2. Your savings account doesn't keep growing to keep up with inflation every year. Every 18 years, you will need approximately DOUBLE the amount of money you need today to maintain the SAME standard of living as today. Sadly, you can't just stick that money in a savings account because it won't grow with inflation. So we're all forced to make risky investments in the stock market, real estate, etc. which can collapse and then we can lose it all. Prudent savers who just want to tuck away what they've earned for a rainy day (or for retirement) are punished long-term. Even worse (from my point of view) is that once we realize that we have NO CHOICE but to invest in the stock market to keep our savings relevant in the future, we all begin to become corporate cheerleaders for companies that might not be doing great things for the world. For example, we may suddenly WANT evil Monsanto to succeed or some evil military company to succeed, because our mutual funds are invested in those companies.
To answer your question about why the government is borrowing so much, they have no choice. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 put all money creation into the hands of the Fed, who print money with interest due on that money. It's crazy! It didn't always used to be this way... the government used to print money backed by assets (gold). Here's a great 3-minute intro video on this topic: 
But check out the book &amp; videos I mentioned above... they do a much better job of explaining this than I can.

I saw the warning myself when I went to the phishing URL that was posted by the guy who got scammed. The thieves were using Coinbase's API (as if they were app developers), so their nasty little trick was that their website automatically redirected to Coinbase's website where you are asked to authorize a 3rd-party app.  It's the same exact warning that comes up whenever you authorize any app that uses Coinbase's API. You can see the warning for yourself by installing any one of the apps listed at &lt; Before any of those apps are allowed to withdraw money from your account, you have to authorize the app first. However, I do think that Coinbase can make the warning even MORE clear to the user. It is easy to miss. And another problem is that now I realize that ANY APP that uses Coinbase's API has the FULL ABILITY to withdraw  ALL of the money from your wallet! Even an app developer that is "good" now can always turn "rogue" tomorrow and steal your bitcoins! I suppose that one solution would be for Coinbase to fully vet any developers who want to use their API, and collect full identifying information on them for potential legal recourse later.

I totally agree 100% with this article. There is one reason that drugs are still illegal: there is BIG BIG MONEY behind keeping them illegal. The pharmaceutical industry, the for-profit prison industry, the alcohol industry, and the police industry have all donated BILLIONS OF DOLLARS towards policies that keep drugs illegal, because it ensures them TONS OF PROFITS in the decades ahead. This is not conspiracy theory, this is fact.

Excellent point! Yes, your $1 will always be the exact same value as my $1. You and me are in the exact same boat. We are losing purchasing power together. 
However, the people who are NOT in the same boat as us are the people at the top of the money chain who are CREATING the money out of thin air and lending it out as debt to the rest of us: these are the banks and the Federal Reserve. 
They profit off us in two ways:
(1) they have the ability to spend this newly-created money FIRST, before it has entered the system and diluted our purchasing power.
and 
(2) they unbelievably charge INTEREST on the money that they simply created out of thin air. So they print the money out of thin air, and then lend it out with interest due on it. In essence, it's sort of like a pyramid scheme because since they print all the money and then they expect interest back on it, there will never be enough money to pay back all the interest.
There is a great 5-episode video series on this very topic called [The Hidden Secrets of Money]( I loved all 5 episodes, but Episode  is widely considered to be the best in the series, so I linked to Episode  However, I think you would enjoy watching all 5 episodes.

Yes. Coinbase is even worse than the existing banking system, because they purposefully track your bitcoin purchases for life using the blockchain. Even if you transfer all of your funds away from them, they will still be tracking your purchases.

*Key sections from the article:*
**Everybody is Happy**
It is also important to note that although they are being subjected to a hidden tax, most citizens actually are quite happy with things as they are. As Gary North has observed in an essay, everybody involved appears to be happy, the robbers as well as the robbed. The banks are happy to be part of a cartel led by the central bank, which gives them immense latitude in indulging in consistent and flagrant overtrading of their capital, spurred on by the moral hazard created by having a “lender of last resort” backstopping them, which can conjure up money out of thin air without limit. Politicians and bureaucrats are happy because there is very little restriction on their spending and there is nothing stopping them from buying votes or indulging in whatever pet projects they happen to dream up.
And lastly, among the people who should actually rise in protest, there are large sub-groups that are either wards of the State and dependent on its largesse (the shameful secret of the welfare state is that it makes irresponsible slaves out of what would otherwise be free and responsible people), or have amassed so much debt in the pursuit of instant gratification that they are quite happy to see money being devalued at a steady pace. In a nation where the majority are debtors, inflation is the politically most palatable form of monetary policy. After all, everybody is focused on the short term (politicians and bureaucrats on their terms of office, consumers on their debt and their desire to buy more things they don’t need with money they don’t have, and so forth).
Few people stop to consider that this policy means ruin in the long run. Over time, the middle and lower classes will see their real incomes and living standards shrink ever more, while the true beneficiaries of inflation – those who get first dibs on newly created fiat money – amass more and more wealth in a kind of reverse redistribution from later receivers.
**Wealth Producers Have No Say**
Savers and genuine wealth producers are put at a great disadvantage by inflation. Wealth generators have to contend with the fact that the creation of additional money creates a demand for scarce goods without a preceding contribution to the pool of savings. Nothing can be exchanged for something, and their own savings will no longer allow them to exercise demand for goods to the extent they expected.
Not surprisingly, the small elite that actually profits from the fiat money system is quite content to take the long term view for itself. Actual producers of wealth are a very small group, too small to have a decisive voice in how things should be run. They would all have to go on strike if they wanted to exercise some pressure , a la John Galt. Unfortunately, big established businesses are usually in bed with the State and are happy with the status quo as well – their main aim is to keep competition from upstarts at bay, so they are quite content with the various methods by which the market economy is hampered. They give lip service to the idea of truly free, competitive markets, but concurrently lobby for anti-competitive regulations all the time.

The politicians need money to start the unpopular wars (to buy weapons, pay the soldiers, etc.). The government can either tax the people to raise the money to start those wars (which people would protest against, because they don't like higher taxes), or the government can SILENTLY TAX the people through inflation. Inflation is a hidden tax. 
Every U.S. Dollar, including the 50 cents that you owe me in interest, was created as debt -- either by the banks or by the Federal Reserve. So the entire system is a debt-based system. So even though you may not personally be in debt when you pay me back, someone owes the debt on that 50 cents.
Costs of goods increase because your $1 doesn't buy you as much today as it did yesterday. Many years ago, you used to be able to buy 20 gallons of milk for $1. Today, you can't even buy a single gallon of milk for $1. So the NUMBER OF DOLLARS in your bank account stays the same, but you can't purchase as much goods or services for it anymore. That is why it is a hidden &amp; silent tax.
I may not be doing an excellent job of explaining this, so I would highly recommend watching The Hidden Secrets of Money (especially episode  It's a pretty complex topic, but Mike Maloney does a great job of making it easier to understand.

In some cases, yes. In some cases, no. For example, if a merchant is using a middleman such as Coinbase to process their transactions, the merchant or Coinbase can issue refunds. The refund capability is even built into the Coinbase API. But yes, in some cases (i.e. when going peer-to-peer), Bitcoin is designed just like digital cash... if you leave the wrong amount of cash somewhere, you can lose it. But I believe that most people are honest... someone once accidentally donated .3 BTC to me when they meant to donate .03 BTC to me, and they emailed me to ask me if I could please send them back the .27 BTC difference, and I did. It seems to me like most of the time, you'll be doing business with someone who is somewhat trustworthy, because you're already trusting &amp; depending on them to deliver a product/service to you anyways. If you don't trust them, you can also use an escrow service like  Now granted, the guy who donated to me didn't know me and made a potentially-fatal mistake by typing in the wrong amount to me, and yes, that can happen with Bitcoin... but it would be the equivalent of stuffing a $100 bill into a donation charity box at the mall, and then realizing that you only meant to stuff in a $10 bill... mistakes with cash can happen. But Bitcoin has the advantage of unlimited possibilities for consumer protection BECAUSE it is programmable money, so there are so many great potential solutions to this problem that can just be programmed in.

Great job on the version 0.5 release!! It just keeps getting better &amp; better!! There does seem to be a few security inconsistencies in the app:
- You can open the app without being required to type in your PIN.
- Once the app is open (without a PIN needed), there is a lock at the top right which shields your balance until you type in your PIN. However, you can just tap on the icon in the upper left to see all the transactions and their dollar amounts... no PIN needed.
- You can change the TouchID limit without requiring a PIN.
- Not sure how to enable TouchID for the app?
- Not security related, but a feature request: would love to import a private key just by pasting in the address instead of needing the QR code.

The phishing email falsely used the Coinbase name. And once the victim was redirected to the Coinbase website, he was genuinely logging into the real Coinbase website but he was actually authorizing an app called "CoinApps" to have the ability to withdraw all the funds from his account. So it said "CoinApps" on the Coinbase login page. There were 2 "names" on the page: CoinApps and Coinbase. You can see this for yourself by installing an app that uses the Coinbase API, such as Gliph. When you authorize Gliph, you will be taken to the Coinbase page to authorize Gliph having full access to withdraw all your funds.

This definitely debunks the myth that Android is "open". Google has an even heavier hand than Apple! Even worse for Android users, Google works directly with the NSA, while Apple tries to protect users' privacy:

AWESOME!! Fantastic. Hope it does as well as I think it will.

p.s. No savvy investor puts all of their life savings into one basket. You're clearly new to investing.

Gold RETAINS its value over time, so it's like a cash savings account that won't lose value on you. But in order to GROW your value over time, the best investment is still stocks &amp; real estate. Big difference between retaining value &amp; growing value.

That guy needs to learn about BitPay.

This is an NSA project:

Interesting. I didn't know that statistic. What is the solution?
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:35:15
Bitpay does more for the Bitcoin community than probably any other company!!

THE OPPOSITE OF ADDICTION IS NOT SOBRIETY. IT IS HUMAN CONNECTION:

At this time in history, this is the  most important Bitcoin project that all Bitcoin supporters should be helping to fund. Without a solution like BitSquare, we completely lose the fungibility of Bitcoin, which destroys its ability to be a currency.

Nope, I've never been to Pennsylvania! And thanks for the multisig advice!!

I have Reddit Gold because it allows me to tag trolls like you as a troll.

The problem with an inflating money system is that it steals purchasing power from the masses. Even if the population growth is expanding, it still dilutes the power of the existing money that hard workers have earned &amp; saved. This article gives a good analogy, comparing inflation to buying goods at an auction:

That was over a day ago. I'm having app problems now.

I believe both.

LOL. I thought it was 7. Three is even worse!
EDIT: The Bitcoin Wiki says 7 transactions per second, as I originally thought:

You don't need an exchange nor strangers to get BTC. Those are just on-ramps. You can get BTC as a gift from a friend or family member who already has BTC, do a job/project for BTC, sell something for BTC, receive a tip in BTC, etc.

Nice article, but it's unclear why any of these industries would switch to Bitcoin. The remittance market, yes. Bitcoin is PERFECT for remittances. But why would consumers want to use Bitcoin to pay at gas stations or amazon.com?

This experience is pretty terrible. One of the worst I've seen. I wonder if the BitPay guys can step in and try to get Adyen's merchants to make this smoother.

That was terrific, thanks for posting!

So, according to your argument, we should also ban sugars, trans fats, and marijuana? Why don't we make everything illegal? How about owning a knife? Or driving a car? And alcohol, the  cause of drunk driving deaths every year? 
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:43:10
Some people, maybe even most, could be responsible car drivers. Some can't and society has to repair the damage caused by their behavior. Maybe we should just ban all cars too?
Your arguments are terrible because they are what caused prohibition, the most dangerous &amp; deadly time in America because of gangsters and underground smuggling of alcohol. 
Which one year in America saw the largest DECREASE in murders &amp; violence? The year after prohibition ended.
If someone can't handle drugs because they have an addiction, then you're solution is to put them in jail and make them a criminal? How about giving them help instead?
