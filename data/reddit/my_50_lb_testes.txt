Not to mention all of the coins/tokens built off of ETH that rely on and trade using ETH. Not saying Ethereum is set in stone because anything can happen but damn if it doesn't have pretty strong backing.

I personally get all of my investment advice from comments on Pornhub

This is one big reason I started getting into some of the alts like TRX and FUN. I believe they can go somewhere and they have subreddits that aren't just memes and screaming at each other like children
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:10:59
Chill bro. 
And in the future if you don't want someone challenging something you say, cite a source. It's a good habit to get into.

They mentioned long transaction times and high fees. The way people explained it made it sound like Steam also didn't hold the btc but instead took btc and immediately had it converted to usd by a third party or something. I could be wrong though, I was half asleep when I was reading about it tbh

Satoshi Nakamoto is a self implementing artificial intelligence using the creation of Bitcoin to submit mankind to a test culminating in complete annihilation or the evolution of humanity into superbeings made of pure energy.

Yeah I keep seeing these where people have a specific number they plan to cash at and I'm like, "am I weird for not having a specific moon?"

I was hoping to slowly make my way to a full coin for the psychological goal but it's been growing too fast for me to have any hope of that. At this rate I'd be working on the second half of the coin paying 5x what I did for the first half. Just in the two weeks I've been waiting to get paid since my last buy in its gone up by thousands
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:25:42
Sorry, honestly dude I've yet to find a single source I could consider reliable and unbiased. Unfortunately like most news today it seems best to scour sites and articles yourself and kind of piece everything together
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:33:01
Man this hit me. I don't even care about fancy cars and houses. I just want to feel like I can afford to have a family without feeling like I'm gonna die all the time. Get my mom to doctors that may actually try to find out what's wrong instead of dosing her with pills that ravage her mind and sending her on her way after a ten minute appointment. Maybe tell my dad to hang up his boots before his body is just completely broken to the point that he can't enjoy his last years after 50+ years of blue collar steel work. I don't mind working hard and I sure as shit do it a lot, but I just want to live some, you know? 
Bitcoin will never make me rich, I can't put enough in to get that much out and I only put in what I can afford to say goodbye to forever, but it's nice thinking someday it may help me give back a bit.
Sorry to drop this wall of text on your comment but I'm half drunk and emotional right now lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:11:30
Well shit thanks man, hadn't heard of this coin until now I'll have to check it out
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:15:04
Holy shit I needed that, that was hilarious
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:49:01
Dogecoin obviously
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:25:58
Quick what are your favorite 12 or 24 words and bitcoin wallet to use?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:12:47
I know it's probably supposed to be pronounced ho-dul with a long O, but for some reason I always day hoddle in my head
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:08:38
I would expect it to fall leading up to futures and then probably dip even more as a lot of the weak hands start dumping their coin to minimize loss. It will go back up. If you're in this for the long haul, consider it a btc super sale.
And remember the number one rule, only ever put in what you're willing to lose
Edit: replied to wrong comment, sorry friendo

@_date: 2017-11-28 08:07:12
I closed my eyes and just let the FOMO take me and bought because I wanted a nice round number of bitcoin on my ledger when we rolled over to 10k. Feels good man
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:52:39
Told a guy at work about checking out bitcoin, barely got it out before he blurted out "bitcoin is stupid! It's not government backed, you can't just SAY something has value!"
In the coming years, don't say I didn't try and help you coworker guy -_-
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:53:11
I wasn't even calling it bcash before but now I am
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:10:27
Haha man tell me about it, I'm trying to chip away at it but everytime I get ready to buy it goes up a few hundred. Not gonna complain and it's a total psychological goal but damn if I don't want just one full coin
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:44:37
Also one thing that hurts it is people buy a lot of bitcoin with the hope that in the future it will make them very wealthy
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:26:25
I want to believe you but that sounds so ludicrous
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:31:44
"Hm that's weird, it's going down instead of straight to the MOON. It's a dip guys, we got a dip! I definitely predicted this! HODL TESLAMBO"
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:14:27
Don't worry, once we hit $8k I'm goin full coconut

Definitely not a bet I would've taken if I were him
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:54:07
Shit couldn't you have waited until the morning when I'd be ready to buy?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:21:05
I barely have any btc but can I join? She doesn't need to know I'm not a millionaire, and I'm great at jerking it
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:57:16
Good luck enforcing that, you think all the nerds hodling coin will just roll over? A lot of people will be transacting through dick butt pics on imgur before they just up and dump btc
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:47:55
I mean I appear to be listening to you, it's been at least twenty minutes since I let the FOMO get me and bought more
Edit: scratch that. oh boy here I go buying btc again
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:36:09
Unless you have a lot of capital you're willing to put in and potentially never see again, I think it's past the "bitcoin millionaire" portion. However BTC will most likely continue to rise so even if you just buy $50 today, it could very well be $100 quickly and that's a nice gain. People love to meme here and talk about a satoshi being worth a million $$$ this time next week, but you've got to stay grounded and realistic and not let yourself get caught up in the hype. Buy dips and hodl

I may or may not have some foil packets in a drawer around here somewhere ¯\_(ツ)_/ ¯
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:28:55
This is pretty conservative compared to some other I've read but as selfish as it sounds I wouldn't mind if it leveled for a tiny bit. I can't keep up at the rate btc has been growing lol. I'll never REALLY complain about it growing though

I remember when I was smoking reefer with Satoshi and he said he had an idea for a digital currency and I was like "lol what's an internet?"
Edit: Thanks for the gold, friend!
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:50:31
Man I bought at ~$600 and used it to buy a nootropic drug that I never used, imagine how stupid I feel getting back in at $7k lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:39:26
I ran out of tendies and had to send my mom to the store for more so no memes until after my nap
