This is unfortunately correct.  Apple provides no way for users to select which app will respond to if multiple apps register for the same URL scheme.  It seems to choose one randomly (and then consistently that one) until one of the apps is deleted or a new one is installed.  Not even the last one installed is consistently called to respond to the URL scheme.
The only permanent solution is to delete other wallet apps.  However, within ShapeShift, there is a breadwallet button which uses a breadwallet specific URL and should only launch breadwallet.  This is accessed from the address book in ShapeShift.  
Check it out and see if that works for you.

Well, it's interesting because the Apple documentation for iOS8 states that there is "no process" for choosing which app will be opened.  It's frustrating as it also isn't tied to when you installed any given app - it seems quite random.  Our tests seem to support this, and it's difficult because the only way to force any given app is to literally uninstall all other apps which respond to that callback URL.  
Hopefully in iOS9, Apple will make this more programmable.

QR won't scan, it's painted on at random.  While the Japanese are precise, painting a quarter inch squared QR is quite a challenge!  Nevertheless the love of bitcoin is strong in Japan.

Well put, Cedric.  You should be proud of what you and the team built and we will miss Buttercoin.
