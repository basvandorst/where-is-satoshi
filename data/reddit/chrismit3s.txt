Well, he certainly has a lot of influence on it, and even though he may not *own* it, that's basically what owning is. Having a lot of(/*all*) influence on something.

Just wanted to tell you, since you're maybe wondering what crazy discussion you triggered. You basically triggered the never ending war between (Bitcoin, btc) and (Bitcoin **Cash**, bch). 
I'm gonna try to give you a bit of unbiased information, but I can't promise that it'll be 100% opinion free.
So bitcoin became popular, and at point the was a fork: bitcoin cash was formed. And Roger Ver and other try to make people think bitcoin cash is the *real* cryptocurrency, by taking over the official bitcoin twitter account, and certainly websites previously identified with bitcoin.
Edit: Also I don't get why you're downvoted, since in my opinion it's perfectly find to ask even the silliest question (this isn't even one).

Well, I see your point but I think the coin is what people do with it.
Say some day the comes a new social platform, let call it *"Twitter ~~cash~~talk"*, and the people who created it spread everywhere that its the *real* twitter, and *"Twitter"* is just some other platform.  
Clearly, *"Twitter talk"* didn't do anything but existing, but it's still *scam*, because people use it to trick people into using it.  
Here's the definition of scam (from [dictionary.cambidge.org](


Would you use *"Twitter talk"* because it's the *real* twitter? Probably not. Would you use *"Twitter talk"* because it has some awesome features? Maybe, and that's ok.  
But it's not ok to spread fake information (for example by overtaking social media accounts, etc) to make people believe *"Twitter talk"* is the 'official' twitter.
