Don't expect them to be 100% accurate.... 
your ROI will at least be double what they suggest if you are lucky. You will probably never break even on that 3.3 TH/s, you are better off investing that $10,000 in the currency itself when you feel it's a good time to buy and watch it grow from there. The real market to be in is not mining but the companies who sell those over priced pre-order machines to mine, they get to mine as well.. it comes with the territory and take your cash on top of it. Especially when that 3.3 TH/s is obsolete (which it will be sooner rather than later) and the price of that machine will be 50% less than what it is now.

Most feel it's just not worth their time, and look beyond it. My uncle who is a cpa/cfo has bought some BTC (loves the idea) but had no idea who Satoshi Nakamoto was or how to handle BTC transactions; let alone read the nine page pdf.... I do it all for it him(I am 20) But in his eyes his time is much more valuable too him. As do the majority who are unaware, they rather not change and stick to their obsolete habits.

BTC mining is not profitable, you're better off converting your fiat notes to BTC and sitting on it. Scrypt mining is currently where its at, you can mine scrypt coins and also convert them to BTC if you wish. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 00:55:46
Miners will still be needed to confirm transactions even after they won't be rewarded in BTC. They will then be rewarded by transaction fees. So the more BTC gets popular the more fees. If miners stop mining then the difficulty will drop allowing those continuing to mine at a easier difficulty.

BTC has nowhere to go but up in 2014. Yeah it could crash and be worthless tomorrow or five years from now. But after two 'little' jumps in 2013, 2014 looks like sky's the limit for BTC and all crypto currencies. Especially since crypto currencies are getting more and more attention everyday.

Did the same exact thing (last week) and similarly worded. Not before I called support and played dumb on how to close my account, though.

Solid post, valid point. I would hope most people do know the actual meaning behind something being 'backed' by something. Sure you could say the US Note is backed by gold &amp; silver, but what backs that? Because a gov't says so? The US Note is only worth something because we believe it is. If the general consensus believes its worthless then it is.

Really unless you have a lot of money to spend and you buy a top end miner, also assuming your order is one of first in line, so you get yours in a few months.. then maybe you might make BTC. But that's a lot of 'if's'.... Personally I wouldn't spend $10,000 on a BTC miner I would just invest in BTC itself  at a lower price. You're better off mining other alt crypto currencies like stated above, but mining does serve a good purpose for the crypto community. Miners will be needed for BTC to confirm transactions even after you won't be rewarded in BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:23:55

When I made my purchase with Zappos via Gyft I called their support to make sure my Gyft card was charged and not my credit card. I told them I used Bitcoins and how convenient it made the transaction. The support guy never asked what is Bitcoin, But he did say I'll have to check it out. But I understand where you are coming from, I'd like to spend my BTC directly with the merchant as well.

Watch where the price is by the end of the year... I put money into BTC in early Feb - April last year right before and when the rise peaked. It crashed right after; but by the end of the year I had more than quadrupled what I initially invested. Unless you know what you are doing in trading, I suggest put some money you can afford to loose into BTC and just sit on it. You will watch it grow 
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:13:35
Very true, I like its growth over the stock market by far. I just dont like to have unrealistic expectations. But yes, you're correct BTC is way up over a short period of time (five years) you wont get returns like that in shares. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 09:27:51
Not talking Europe soccer betting but more like US four major sports betting... Like the Red Wings Vs the Toronto Maple Leafs today at the Winter Classic at the Big House. THAT would be a ideal game to bet on, 112k+ fans for a hockey game, largest attendance ever, new years day. And obviously playoffs for any sport would be huge, and even just general every night regular season games to bet on.

Bought a 50 GH/s Single from BFL, I waited five months after I ordered for it to arrive. Only to have to RMA it back. That went surprisingly quick. (1 week) got it mining (Mining at 55 GH/s) and fortunately made my money back and still mining barely profitable today.. would of been better off investing in more BTC to begin with. Don't let BFL make a buck off you! I received my miner back in early October. The rise in price essentially saved me in ROI.

I put over $5,000 USD in BTC about a year ago, right when it was first rising rapidly. Then the price plummeted and I was on the + side of a few purchases but mostly on the negative side. I planed on this being a long term investment to begin with so I wasn't too discouraged. Well, you know what happened at the end of the year and I more than quadrupled my original investment. Of course I didn't invest money I needed and couldn't afford to loose... so I held fast. Just sit tight and enjoy the ride, BTC has been around longer than you've been "in it" and has done nothing but flourished. It might take two steps forward and one step back on some days and on others it may do the exact opposite. "Just the way she goes...." - Ray  
Edit: Seems that many here have some very unrealistic expectations.. like many have

Couldn't of said it better myself. It's simple common sense, which, yes... most of us seem to lack. If you want to invest buy low and keep your coins. Don't sell when the price rises and try to re-buy when it drops again, when actually you lost money on your transaction fee's... Best to just stay in 'your lane' when it comes to life folks. Also, whoever has put in more money than they can afford to loose, I hope you have some serious luck because that's the oldest rule in the book.

QR codes are mostly on billboards in the inner city, where someone walking may stop and quickly scan it. It's possible for someone to pull over in their vehicle and do so too. But that's if you aren't going anywhere or even feel like the hassle. Personally, QR codes are best on things you can buy, checkout lines, and the internet, obviously..
