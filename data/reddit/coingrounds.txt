Hey, blog will be launched tomorrow with some content. We're also adding a forum when we launch. Subscribe to get updated on our progress. We plan to launch around mid November - right now we're gathering a network of sellers to launch with. Let me know if you have any questions.

It's the small things that count. Our matching engine makes it really convenient for frequent buyers and sellers - think of it as a hybrid between a traditional exchange and a LB. We have algorithms that detect fraud behaviour and we react fast. Our ranking system is progressive and we reward reliable users with better payment options + lower transaction fees. We're working hard everyday collecting a massive network of reliable vetted sellers. This is not a zero sum game.. competition in this space is great as BTC gets more attention. Our team is building this product with the the goal in mind to build the fastest and easiest exchange in the market today. Bitcoin is decentralized and your exchange should be too. Subscribe to our beta and we can give you a demo to check out! Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

This is a great idea. We plan to do this and decrease the fee proportionally for completing x amount of trades. Thank you for the suggestion

They are a lot more lenient on p2p exchanges because we do not hold fiat on our system - and generally transaction volumes are much lower and distributed than traditional exchanges. With that being said we are working with counsel to ensure we protect ourselves from a compliance perspective. There will be measures we may have to take down the road to abide by KYC and AML.

Thanks for subscribing. We'd love to offer you our services. Any feedback you may have on making your experience on Coingrounds optimal we would greatly appreciate.

That's why we started Coingrounds. We were really frustrated with the OTC exchanges in the market today. It's such a powerful concept that is aligned with the mission of Bitcoins... but unfortunately their products really suck. We are spending a lot of time on the UI/UX ensuring that the entire buy/sell process is streamlined. Any feedback you may have on attracting bulk sellers would be appreciated. That's really our limitation right now for launch - we need to make sure we have a pool of reliable sellers beforehand. Thanks!

Aside from Cash/WU/MG we have a database of irreversible payment options for each country (bank) we are launching in. We will offer reversible payments but include the necessary security features to limit the chance of fraud. We'll only allow users with high feedback (our feedback system can't be gamed) to accept such options. We'll also require some verification from the user to start accepting these other options.

Mid November - subscribe to get access to our beta

Yes. But as I mentioned, we're collecting a database of reliable sellers before we launch. Since we are a marketplace we are subject to solving the chicken and the egg (sellers and buyers) problem. Our rating system is progressive as well... so users get incentives for scoring high (reduced fees, alternate payment options and high visibility for search). We feel that if you're able to build a dynamic rating engine it would greatly reduce the risk of fraud and scammers.

We will have a web wallet that stores coins. We have 2FA, email confirmation and sms integration to release BTC from escrow (optional). Our goal was to have a decentralized escrow market with ratings.. but this is a technical challenge. We've put a lot of emphasis on beefing up our security to keep you guys safe.

Fiat transactions occur outside our system. Both the seller and buyer will negotiate the optimal payment method (i.e wire, cash deposit, SEPA, WU, MG and etc). Our system will handle disputes - transactions can only be cleared once both parties verify payment.
@_date: 2013-10-13 09:37:36
This is a great idea. We'll consider it.

We charge a 1% fee on successful transactions. All users that sign up to our beta will get the service for free (waive the fee) and be offered preference for exposure. Buyers get protected ensuring there are quality sellers on board. If there is a dispute we require proof of transaction from the buyer before releasing escrow. We are well funded right now - so our goal is not to try and make a quick buck sacrificing the quality of the product.

No problem. We'll shoot you an email when we're ready.
